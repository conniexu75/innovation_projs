https://openalex.org/W1975355918,"Reprogrammed glucose metabolism as a result of increased glycolysis and glucose uptake is a hallmark of cancer. Here we show that cancer cells can suppress glucose uptake by non-tumour cells in the premetastatic niche, by secreting vesicles that carry high levels of the miR-122 microRNA. High miR-122 levels in the circulation have been associated with metastasis in breast cancer patients, and we show that cancer-cell-secreted miR-122 facilitates metastasis by increasing nutrient availability in the premetastatic niche. Mechanistically, cancer-cell-derived miR-122 suppresses glucose uptake by niche cells in vitro and in vivo by downregulating the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. In vivo inhibition of miR-122 restores glucose uptake in distant organs, including brain and lungs, and decreases the incidence of metastasis. These results demonstrate that, by modifying glucose utilization by recipient premetastatic niche cells, cancer-derived extracellular miR-122 is able to reprogram systemic energy metabolism to facilitate disease progression. Wang and colleagues report that cancer-cell-derived extracellular vesicles that contain miR-122 reprogram glucose metabolism of premetastatic niche cells to alter nutrient availability and promote metastasis."

PAD4 has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune, cardiovascular and oncological diseases through clinical genetics and gene disruption in mice. New selective PAD4 inhibitors binding a calcium-deficient form of the PAD4 enzyme have validated the critical enzymatic role of human and mouse PAD4 in both histone citrullination and neutrophil extracellular trap formation for, to our knowledge, the first time. The therapeutic potential of PAD4 inhibitors can now be explored."

https://openalex.org/W2007100755,"Steven McCarroll and colleagues report an analysis of multiallelic copy number variants (mCNVs). They characterize mCNVs in 849 whole-genome sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project and find that mCNVs give rise to most gene dosage variation in humans. Thousands of genomic segments appear to be present in widely varying copy numbers in different human genomes. We developed ways to use increasingly abundant whole-genome sequence data to identify the copy numbers, alleles and haplotypes present at most large multiallelic CNVs (mCNVs). We analyzed 849 genomes sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project to identify most large (>5-kb) mCNVs, including 3,878 duplications, of which 1,356 appear to have 3 or more segregating alleles. We find that mCNVs give rise to most human variation in gene dosage—seven times the combined contribution of deletions and biallelic duplications—and that this variation in gene dosage generates abundant variation in gene expression. We describe 'runaway duplication haplotypes' in which genes, including HPR and ORM1, have mutated to high copy number on specific haplotypes. We also describe partially successful initial strategies for analyzing mCNVs via imputation and provide an initial data resource to support such analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2169133561,"Andrew Foote and colleagues report the whole-genome sequences and de novo assemblies of three marine mammal species—the walrus, killer whale and manatee—and an improved bottlenose dolphin genome. Their comparative genomic analysis finds evidence of parallel evolution across the marine mammal genomes. Marine mammals from different mammalian orders share several phenotypic traits adapted to the aquatic environment and therefore represent a classic example of convergent evolution. To investigate convergent evolution at the genomic level, we sequenced and performed de novo assembly of the genomes of three species of marine mammals (the killer whale, walrus and manatee) from three mammalian orders that share independently evolved phenotypic adaptations to a marine existence. Our comparative genomic analyses found that convergent amino acid substitutions were widespread throughout the genome and that a subset of these substitutions were in genes evolving under positive selection and putatively associated with a marine phenotype. However, we found higher levels of convergent amino acid substitutions in a control set of terrestrial sister taxa to the marine mammals. Our results suggest that, whereas convergent molecular evolution is relatively common, adaptive molecular convergence linked to phenotypic convergence is comparatively rare."

https://openalex.org/W2132117565,"Domestic pigs have evolved genetic adaptations to their local environmental conditions, such as cold and hot climates. We sequenced the genomes of 69 pigs from 15 geographically divergent locations in China and detected 41 million variants, of which 21 million were absent from the dbSNP database. In a genome-wide scan, we identified a set of loci that likely have a role in regional adaptations to high- and low-latitude environments within China. Intriguingly, we found an exceptionally large (14-Mb) region with a low recombination rate on the X chromosome that appears to have two distinct haplotypes in the high- and low-latitude populations, possibly underlying their adaptation to cold and hot environments, respectively. Surprisingly, the adaptive sweep in the high-latitude regions has acted on DNA that might have been introgressed from an extinct Sus species. Our findings provide new insights into the evolutionary history of pigs and the role of introgression in adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2050513958,"The authors show that astrocytes produce high levels of the adenosine receptor A2A in Alzheimer brains. Reducing the levels of astrocytic A2A boosted memory in young and aging mice and mouse models of Alzheimer disease, whereas activating a related molecular pathway impaired memory. Thus, astrocytes regulate memory and abnormal receptor activity in these cells may contribute to memory disorders. Astrocytes express a variety of G protein–coupled receptors and might influence cognitive functions, such as learning and memory. However, the roles of astrocytic Gs-coupled receptors in cognitive function are not known. We found that humans with Alzheimer's disease (AD) had increased levels of the Gs-coupled adenosine receptor A2A in astrocytes. Conditional genetic removal of these receptors enhanced long-term memory in young and aging mice and increased the levels of Arc (also known as Arg3.1), an immediate-early gene that is required for long-term memory. Chemogenetic activation of astrocytic Gs-coupled signaling reduced long-term memory in mice without affecting learning. Like humans with AD, aging mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) showed increased levels of astrocytic A2A receptors. Conditional genetic removal of these receptors enhanced memory in aging hAPP mice. Together, these findings establish a regulatory role for astrocytic Gs-coupled receptors in memory and suggest that AD-linked increases in astrocytic A2A receptor levels contribute to memory loss."
https://openalex.org/W2107429180,"The Wnt signaling pathway controls stem cell identity in the intestinal epithelium and in many other adult organs. The transcription factor Ascl2 (a Wnt target gene) is a master regulator of intestinal stem cell identity. It is unclear how the continuous Wnt gradient along the crypt axis is translated into discrete expression of Ascl2 and discrete specification of stem cells at crypt bottoms. We show that (1) Ascl2 is regulated in a direct autoactivatory loop, leading to a distinct on/off expression pattern, and (2) Wnt/R-spondin can activate this regulatory loop. This mechanism interprets the Wnt levels in the intestinal crypt and translates the continuous Wnt signal into a discrete Ascl2 ""on"" or ""off"" decision. In turn, Ascl2, together with β-catenin/Tcf, activates the genes fundamental to the stem cell state. In this manner, Ascl2 forms a transcriptional switch that is both Wnt responsive and Wnt dependent to define stem cell identity."
https://openalex.org/W2019882992,"There is increasing evidence that mast cells (MCs) and their mediators are involved in the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment and promote tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. We have found that an increased density of MCs in thyroid cancer (TC) correlates with enhanced invasiveness. However, the MC-derived factors responsible for this activity and the mechanisms by which they enhance TC invasiveness remain unidentified. Here, we report that MCs, when activated by TC cells, produce soluble factors that induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness features of TC cells. We identified CXCL8/interleukin (IL)-8 as the main mediator contained in activated MC conditioned media (CM) capable of inducing both EMT and stemness of TC cells. Mechanistically, MC CM or exogenous IL-8 stimulated Akt phosphorylation and Slug expression in TC cells. The inhibition of the Akt pathway or depletion of the Slug transcription factor by RNA interference, reverted EMT and stemness responses. TC cells stably transfected with exogenous IL-8 underwent EMT, displayed increased stemness and enhanced tumorigenicity with respect to control cells. The analysis of TC surgical specimens by immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between MC density (Tryptase+ cells) and stemness features (OCT4 staining). Taken together, our data identify an MC-dependent IL-8–Akt–Slug pathway that sustains EMT/stemness of TC cells. The blockade of this circuit might be exploited for the therapy of advanced TC."
https://openalex.org/W2022853846,"Oxygen and nutrient limitation are common features of the tumor microenvironment and are associated with cancer progression and induction of metastasis. The inefficient vascularization of tumor tissue also limits the penetration of other serum-derived factors, such as lipids and lipoproteins, which can be rate limiting for cell proliferation and survival. Here we have investigated the effect of hypoxia and serum deprivation on sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity and the expression of lipid metabolism genes in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cancer cells. We found that SREBP transcriptional activity was induced by serum depletion both in normoxic and hypoxic cells and that activation of SREBP was required to maintain the expression of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism genes under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, the enzyme required for the generation of mono-unsaturated fatty acids, and fatty acid-binding protein 7, a regulator of glioma stem cell function, was strongly dependent on SREBP function. Inhibition of SREBP function blocked lipid biosynthesis in hypoxic cancer cells and impaired cell survival under hypoxia and in a three-dimensional spheroid model. Finally, gene expression analysis revealed that SREBP defines a gene signature that is associated with poor survival in glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2075186699,"The authors recorded spiking activity in the sensorimotor striatum of rats performing a motor sequence in an automatic manner. They report continuous and integrative representation of contextual and kinematic information. Reversible perturbation of these representation increased execution variability, suggesting a strong contribution in constraining the execution motor habits. The striatum is required for the acquisition of procedural memories, but its contribution to motor control once learning has occurred is unclear. We created a task in which rats learned a difficult motor sequence characterized by fine-tuned changes in running speed adjusted to spatial and temporal constraints. After training and extensive practice, we found that the behavior was habitual, yet tetrode recordings in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) revealed continuous integrative representations of running speed, position and time. These representations were weak in naive rats that were hand-guided to perform the same sequence and developed slowly after learning. Finally, DLS inactivation in well-trained animals preserved the structure of the sequence while increasing its trial-by-trial variability. We conclude that, after learning, the DLS continuously integrates task-relevant information to constrain the execution of motor habits. Our results provide a straightforward mechanism by which the basal ganglia may contribute to habit formation and motor control."

https://openalex.org/W71725349,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is an aggressive pediatric tumor, responsible for 15% of cancer-related deaths in childhood, lacking an effective treatment in its advanced stages. The P2X7 receptor for extracellular ATP was associated to NB cell proliferation and recently emerged as a promoter of tumor engraftment, growth and vascularization. In an effort to identify new therapeutic options for neuroblastoma, we studied the role of P2X7 receptor in NB biology. We first analyzed the effect of P2X7 activation or down-modulation of the main biochemical ways involved in NB progression: the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/MYCN and the HIF1α/VEGF pathways. In ACN human NB cells, P2X7 stimulation enhanced PI3K/Akt, while decreasing GSK3β activity. In the same model, P2X7 silencing or antagonist administration reduced the activity of PI3K/Akt and increased that of GSK3β, leading to a decrease in cellular glycogen stores. Similarly, P2X7 downmodulation caused a reduction in HIF1α levels and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion. Systemic administration of two different P2X7 antagonists (AZ10606120 or A740003) in nude/nude mice reduced ACN-derived tumor growth. An even stronger effect of P2X7 blockade was obtained in a syngeneic immune-competent neuroblastoma model: Neuro2A cells injected in AlbinoJ mice. Together with tumor regression, treatment with P2X7 antagonists caused downmodulation of the Akt/HIF1α axis, leading to reduced VEGF content and decreased vessel formation. Interestingly, in both experimental models, P2X7 antagonists strongly reduced the expression of the probably best-accepted oncogene in NB: MYCN. Finally, we associated P2X7 overexpression with poor prognosis in advanced-stage NB patients. Taken together, our data suggest that P2X7 receptor is an upstream regulator of the main signaling pathways involved in NB growth, metabolic activity and angiogenesis, and a promising therapeutic target for neuroblastoma treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1995041376,"The lung alveoli regenerate after surgical removal of the left lobe by pneumonectomy (PNX). How this alveolar regrowth/regeneration is initiated remains unknown. We found that platelets trigger lung regeneration by supplying stromal-cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, also known as CXCL12). After PNX, activated platelets stimulate SDF-1 receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 on pulmonary capillary endothelial cells (PCECs) to deploy the angiocrine membrane-type metalloproteinase MMP14, stimulating alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) expansion and neo-alveolarization. In mice lacking platelets or platelet Sdf1, PNX-induced alveologenesis was diminished. Reciprocally, infusion of Sdf1(+/+) but not Sdf1-deficient platelets rescued lung regeneration in platelet-depleted mice. Endothelial-specific ablation of Cxcr4 and Cxcr7 in adult mice similarly impeded lung regeneration. Notably, mice with endothelial-specific Mmp14 deletion exhibited impaired expansion of AECs but not PCECs after PNX, which was not rescued by platelet infusion. Therefore, platelets prime PCECs to initiate lung regeneration, extending beyond their haemostatic contribution. Therapeutic targeting of this haemo-vascular niche could enable regenerative therapy for lung diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2161443949,"In many cases, cell function is intimately linked to cell shape control. We used endothelial cell branching morphogenesis as a model to understand the role of myosin II in shape control of invasive cells migrating in 3D collagen gels. We applied principles of differential geometry and mathematical morphology to 3D image sets to parameterize cell branch structure and local cell-surface curvature. We find that Rho/ROCK-stimulated myosin II contractility minimizes cell-scale branching by recognizing and minimizing local cell-surface curvature. Using microfabrication to constrain cell shape identifies a positive feedback mechanism in which low curvature stabilizes myosin II cortical association, where it acts to maintain minimal curvature. The feedback between regulation of myosin II by curvature and control of curvature by myosin II drives cycles of localized cortical myosin II assembly and disassembly. These cycles in turn mediate alternating phases of directionally biased branch initiation and retraction to guide 3D cell migration."

https://openalex.org/W2010106948,"Gramicidin A is an antimicrobial peptide that destroys gram-positive bacteria. The bactericidal mechanism of antimicrobial peptides has been linked to membrane permeation and metabolism disruption as well as interruption of DNA and protein functions. However, the exact bacterial killing mechanism of gramicidin A is not clearly understood. In the present study, we examined the antimicrobial activity of gramicidin A on Staphylococcus aureus using biochemical and biophysical methods, including hydroxyl radical and NAD+/NADH cycling assays, atomic force microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Gramicidin A induced membrane permeabilization and changed the composition of the membrane. The morphology of Staphylococcus aureus during gramicidin A destruction was divided into four stages: pore formation, water permeability, bacterial flattening, and lysis. Changes in membrane composition included the destruction of membrane lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Most interestingly, we demonstrated that gramicidin A not only caused membrane permeabilization but also induced the formation of hydroxyl radicals, which are a possible end product of the transient depletion of NADH from the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The latter may be the main cause of complete Staphylococcus aureus killing. This new finding may provide insight into the underlying bactericidal mechanism of gA."
https://openalex.org/W2089768104,"Oncolytic adenoviruses, such as Delta-24-RGD (Δ24RGD), are replication-competent viruses that are genetically engineered to induce selective cancer cell lysis. In cancer cells, Δ24RGD induces massive autophagy, which is required for efficient cell lysis and adenoviral spread. Understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying the regulation of autophagy in cells treated with oncolytic adenoviruses may provide new avenues to improve the therapeutic effect. In this work, we showed that cancer cells infected with Δ24RGDundergo autophagy despite the concurrent activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. Moreover, adenovirus replication induced sustained activation of JNK proteins in vitro. ERK1/2 phosphorylation remained unchanged during adenoviral infection, suggesting specificity of JNK activation. Using genetic ablation and pharmacological inactivation of JNK, we unequivocally demonstrated that cells infected with Δ24RGD required JNK activation. Thus, genetic co-ablation of JNK1 and JNK2 genes or inhibition of JNK kinase function rendered Δ24RGD–treated cells resistant to autophagy. Accordingly, JNK activation induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and prevented the formation of Bcl-2/Beclin 1 autophagy suppressor complexes. Using an orthotopic model of human glioma xenograft, we showed that treatment with Δ24RGD induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of JNK, as well as phosphorylation of Bcl-2. Collectively, our data identified JNK proteins as an essential mechanistic link between Δ24RGD infection and autophagy in cancer cells. Activation of JNK without inactivation of the AKT/mTOR pathway constitutes a distinct molecular signature of autophagy regulation that differentiates Δ24RGD adenovirus from the mechanism used by other oncolytic viruses to induce autophagy and provides a new rationale for the combination of oncolytic viruses and chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1966179301,"Preclinical studies of anticancer drugs are typically performed using cancer cell lines maintained in two-dimensional (2D) cultures, ignoring the influences of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment. In this study, we evaluated the microenvironmental control of human breast cancer cells responses to doxorubicin (DOXO) using the 3D laminin-rich ECM (3D lrECM) cell culture model. Under 3D culture conditions, MCF-7 cells displayed drastic morphological alterations, a decrease in proliferation and elevated sensitivity to DOXO. Interestingly, the chemotherapy-mediated activation of autophagy was compromised in the 3D matrix, suggesting an association between the increased cytotoxicity of DOXO and hindered autophagy induction. Indeed, while chloroquine or ATG5 knockdown potentiated DOXO-induced cell death under the 2D culture conditions, the autophagy inducer rapamycin improved the resistance of 3D-cultured cells to this drug. Moreover, in the monolayer-cultured cells, DOXO treatment led to increases in p53 and DRAM-1 expression, which is a p53-dependent activator of autophagy that functions in response to DNA damage. Conversely, p53 and DRAM-1 expression was impaired in 3D-cultured cells. The knockdown of p53 by shRNA blocked DRAM-1 activation, impaired autophagy induction and sensitized only those cells maintained under 2D conditions to DOXO. In addition, 2D-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells (a p53-mutated breast cancer cell line) not only showed increased sensitivity to DOXO compared with MCF-7 cells but also failed to induce DRAM-1 expression or autophagy. Similar to p53 silencing, DRAM-1 knockdown potentiated DOXO cytotoxicity only in 2D-cultured cells. These results suggest that the 3D tissue microenvironment controls tumor cell sensitivity to DOXO treatment by preventing p53-DRAM-autophagy axis activation."
https://openalex.org/W2083617285,"In the present study, we have assessed whether a putative calcium channel α2δ2 auxiliary subunit (CACNA2D2 gene) could be involved in prostate cancer (PCA) progression. We therefore carried out experiments to determine whether this protein is expressed in PCA LNCaP cells and in PCA tissues, and whether its expression may be altered during cancer development. In addition, we evaluated the influence on cell proliferation of overexpressing or downregulating this subunit. In vitro experiments show that α2δ2 subunit overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation, alterations of calcium homeostasis and the recruitment of a nuclear factor of activated T-cells pathway. Furthermore, we carried out in vivo experiments on immuno-deficient nude mice in order to evaluate the tumorigenic potency of the α2δ2 subunit. We show that α2δ2-overexpressing PCA LNCaP cells are more tumorigenic than control LNCaP cells when injected into nude mice. In addition, gabapentin, a ligand of α2δ2, reduces tumor development in LNCaP xenografts. Finally, we show that the action of α2δ2 on tumor development occurs not only through a stimulation of proliferation, but also through a stimulation of angiogenesis, via an increased secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor in cells overexpressing α2δ2."

We have identified and characterized the Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase from T. cruzi (TcP5CDH) and report here on how this enzyme contributes to a central metabolic pathway in this parasite. Size-exclusion chromatography, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and small angle x-ray scattering analysis of TcP5CDH revealed an oligomeric state composed of two subunits of six protomers.

https://openalex.org/W2061886425,"Combining single-neuron recordings and a multistep economic choice task in monkeys, the authors find activity in amygdala neurons that predicts the value and length of an internally planned choice sequence leading to future reward. Prospective amygdala activity appears to encode components of an internal plan and guide behavior over several steps towards self-defined, distant goals. The best rewards are often distant and can only be achieved by planning and decision-making over several steps. We designed a multi-step choice task in which monkeys followed internal plans to save rewards toward self-defined goals. During this self-controlled behavior, amygdala neurons showed future-oriented activity that reflected the animal's plan to obtain specific rewards several trials ahead. This prospective activity encoded crucial components of the animal's plan, including value and length of the planned choice sequence. It began on initial trials when a plan would be formed, reappeared step by step until reward receipt, and readily updated with a new sequence. It predicted performance, including errors, and typically disappeared during instructed behavior. Such prospective activity could underlie the formation and pursuit of internal plans characteristic of goal-directed behavior. The existence of neuronal planning activity in the amygdala suggests that this structure is important in guiding behavior toward internally generated, distant goals."

DNA damage response RNA polymerase III microRNA dimethyl sulfoxide cytochrome c oxidase 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. RNA polymerase III (Pol III) is the largest RNA polymerase, consisting of 17 subunits, including a DNA-binding site (14.Dieci G. Conti A. Pagano A. Carnevali D.

Consistent with these observations, Pol III activity is increased in many cancers, including melanomas, myelomas, and carcinomas (20.Schwartz L.B. Sklar V.E. Jaehning J.A. Weinmann R. Roeder R.G.

Despite the regulation of Pol III by genes associated with tumorigenesis, little is known about the role of Pol III in the cellular function of transformed cells. Here, we identified the presence of cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids in immortalized and transformed human tumor cells. Chemical inhibition of Pol III abrogated the presence of cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids in cells. Cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids were bound by microRNA (miRNA) machinery-associated proteins, such as DDX17 (DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 17) and AGO2 (argonaute 2). We also identified Pol III-regulated intracellular miRNAs in A549 lung cancer cells. In summary, we demonstrate the constitutive presence of cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids in a variety of cell lines, and this accumulation depends on Pol III, at least in A549 lung carcinoma cells. The human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), colorectal adenocarcinoma (LoVo and HT29), colorectal carcinoma (HCT116), acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1), human cervix carcinoma (HeLa), and normal lung tissue-derived (MRC-5) cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Nichirei Biosciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Nacalai Tesque), and 2% HEPES (Life Technologies). Cells were maintained with 5 μg/ml Plasmocin (InvivoGen) to prevent mycoplasma infection. Ara-C (cytarabine) was purchased from Wako Chemicals. Aphidicolin, Pol III inhibitor ML-60218, and leptomycin B were purchased from Calbiochem. ATM inhibitor KU60019 (Tocris Bioscience) and ATR inhibitor VE821 (Axon Medchem) were used at 10 μm. PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Life Technologies) was used at 1:100 dilution. MitoTracker Red CM-H2XRos (Life Technologies) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and used at 500 nm. Fixed cells were treated with 0.5 units/ml RNase H (New England Biolabs) for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Nacalai Tesque) for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 2% goat serum and 1% BSA in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Transfected cells were stained with anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX IV) antibody (ab16056, Abcam), anti-POLR3G antibody (polymerase (RNA) III (3) (DNA-directed) polypeptide G; LS-C163858, LSBio), or anti-DDX17 antibody (19910-1-AP, Proteintech). The RNA:DNA hybrid-specific antibody S9.6 was a kind gift of Dr. D. Koshland (University of California, Berkeley) (25.Boguslawski S.J. Smith D.E. Michalak M.A. Mickelson K.E. Yehle C.O. Patterson W.L. Carrico R.J. Characterization of monoclonal antibody to DNA·RNA and its application to immunodetection of hybrids.J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The secondary polyclonal antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (H+L) and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (H+L) (Life Technologies). PicoGreen staining of DNA and MitoTracker staining of mitochondria were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were stained with 2 μg/ml Hoechst for 10 min and mounted in mounting medium (Dako). Cell images were taken with a Leica TCS SP2 laser confocal scanning microscope and analyzed using Volocity (version 6.2.1) and Imaris. Micrographs show cells representative of total cell populations. A549 cells were transfected with POLR3G siRNA (Qiagen) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. AllStars negative control siRNA (Qiagen) was used as a control in transfection, and its sequence is proprietary. The POLR3G siRNA sequences used were 5′-AAGGCACACCACTCACTAATA-3′ (siPOLR3G_1) and 5′-TCAGAGTACTCAAGTGTACAA-3′ (siPOLR3G_2). Cells were lysed in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Nacalai Tesque), and lysates were electrophoresed in 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies) and then blotted onto PVDF membranes. Antibodies specific to DDX17 (sc-86409, Santa Cruz), AGO2 (C34C6, Cell Signaling Technology), and GAPDH (M171-3, MBL International) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) were used to develop the blots with Immobilon Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). Digital images were acquired using ImageQuant LAS 500 (GE Healthcare). A549 cells (2 × 106) were seeded into 100-mm dishes and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, followed by treatment with 125 mm glycine (Wako Chemicals) for 5 min. Cells were fractionated using a cell fractionation kit (MS861, MitoSciences). The cytosolic fraction was precleared by incubation with 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 20 min at 4 °C on a rolling shaker. The cleared supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rolling shaker with 10 μg/ml RNA:DNA hybrid-specific antibody and 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed sequentially with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, low salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA), high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 600 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA), final wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA), and Tris/EDTA buffer. Beads were resuspended in Tris/EDTA buffer with 1% SDS and incubated overnight at 65 °C to release protein complexes for subsequent gel electrophoresis. For mass spectrometry, similarly processed cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with RNA:DNA hybrid-specific antibody and silver-stained using a Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bands of interest were cut out and sent for mass spectrometry analysis at the Osaka University mass spectrometry facility. A549 cells were treated with 10 μm Pol III inhibitor for 24 h and subsequently treated with 10 μm Ara-C or DMSO for 15 h. DMSO-treated cells served as a control. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Life Technologies) and labeled using a 3D-Gene miRNA labeling kit. The labeled RNA was hybridized to a human miRNA V19 microarray chip containing 2019 miRNA probes and analyzed on a ProScanArray microarray scanner (Toray Industries). miRNA profiles were provided as sample-wise median-normalized data by Toray Industries. Data were further normalized with an all-sample quantile normalization protocol using the corresponding Bioconductor package developed by Bolstad et al. (26.Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Astrand M. Speed T.P. A comparison of normalization methods for high density oligonucleotide array data based on variance and bias.Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (6397) Google Scholar). Original miRNA profiles consisted of 2019 miRNA probes, of which only a small fraction showed significant expression in any of these experiments. After replacing the missing valued data (no expression observed) with the minimum of all observed expression values, miRNA probes that showed at least 3-fold differential expression between any pair of four experiments were used for further quantitative analysis. Identified miRNA sequences were used to obtain predicted gene targets, as acquired from the public domain resource DIANA-mirPath (27.Vlachos I.S. Kostoulas N. Vergoulis T. Georgakilas G. Reczko M.

DIANA-mirPath v.2.0: investigating the combinatorial effect of microRNAs in pathways.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: W498-W504Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). A p value threshold of 0.05 and a MicroT threshold of 0.8 were applied. After RNA extraction, cDNA was synthesized using a miScript II RT kit (Qiagen). miRNA levels were analyzed using assay kits for mature miR-4499 (Qiagen), precursor (includes detection for precursor and primary miR) miR-4499 (Qiagen), and TaqMan primary miR-4499 (Life Technologies) and quantified by quantitative PCR using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) or TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Life Technologies). Precursor miR expression was determined using the equation in Ref. 28.Schmittgen T.D. Jiang J. Liu Q. Yang L.

Experiments were performed as described previously (9.Lam A.R. Le Bert N. Ho S.S. Shen Y.J. Tang M.L. Xiong G.M. Croxford J.L. Koo C.X. Ishii K.J. Akira S. Raulet D.H. Gasser S. RAE1 ligands for the NKG2D receptor are regulated by STING-dependent DNA sensor pathways in lymphoma.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 2193-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The following primers were used: XPO1-5′ (exportin-1), 5′-AGGTTGGAGAAGTGATGCCA-3′; XPO1-3′, 5′-GCACCAATCATGTACCCCAC-3′; KPNB1-5′ (karyopherin (importin) beta 1), 5′-GACCGACTACCCAGACAGAG-3′; KPNB1-3′, 5′-GACTCCTCCTAAGACGACGG-3′; NUP153-5′ (nucleoporin 153kDa), 5′-GCCCAAATCTTCCTCTGCAG-3′; NUP153-3′, 5′-GAAAGGAGCCACTGAAGCAC-3′; HPRT1-5′, 5′-CCCTGGCGTCGTGATTAGTG-3′; and HPRT1-3′, 5′-TCGAGCAAGACGTTCAGTCC-3′. For statistical analysis, Student's one-tailed t test (p < 0.05) was used unless stated otherwise after data were tested positive for normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test. For data that failed the normality test, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We previously reported (9.Lam A.R. Le Bert N. Ho S.S. Shen Y.J. Tang M.L. Xiong G.M. Croxford J.L. Koo C.X. Ishii K.J. Akira S. Raulet D.H. Gasser S.

Here, we sought to test if RNA:DNA hybrids are present in the cytosol of human cancer cell lines. PicoGreen stained DNA in the cytosol of the human lung carcinoma cell line A549 and other cancer cell lines (Fig. 1, A and B, and Fig. 2, A and B). Three-dimensional surface rendering of confocal images showed that the majority of extranuclear DNA is present outside of mitochondria (Fig. 1B). To analyze if RNA:DNA hybrids contribute to the PicoGreen signals in the cytosol, A549 cells were treated with RNase H, which degrades RNA in RNA:DNA hybrids (31.Frank P. Albert S. Cazenave C. Toulmé J.J. Purification and characterization of human ribonuclease HII.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5247-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), prior to staining with PicoGreen. Pretreatment of cells with RNase H abrogated the cytosolic PicoGreen signals (Fig. 1, A–C). As expected, the staining of nuclear genomic DNA by PicoGreen was not changed.FIGURE 2.Presence of cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids in human tumor cell lines. A, the human colorectal carcinoma cell lines LoVo, HCT116, and HT29; the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1; the human cervix carcinoma cell line HeLa; and the human normal lung tissue-derived cell line MRC-5 were stained for RNA:DNA hybrids (red) in the presence of Hoechst (blue). Scale bars = 10 μm. B, the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines LoVo, HCT116, and HT29 were stained with PicoGreen (upper panels). Bright-field images (differential interference contrast (DIC)) of cells are shown in the lower panels. C, three-dimensional isosurface rendering of confocal images of A549 cells stained for the presence of dsDNA (green) and RNA:DNA hybrids (red) in the presence of Hoechst (blue). Co-localization of dsDNA and RNA:DNA hybrids (yellow) was determined using Volocity computational image analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate the presence of cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids, we stained cells using the RNA:DNA hybrid-specific antibody S9.6 (25.Boguslawski S.J. Smith D.E. Michalak M.A. Mickelson K.E. Yehle C.O. Patterson W.L. Carrico R.J. Characterization of monoclonal antibody to DNA·RNA and its application to immunodetection of hybrids.J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In agreement with the PicoGreen results, S9.6 staining of tumor cells (A549, LoVo, HCT116, HT29, HeLa, and THP-1) and human fetal lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5) showed the presence of RNA:DNA hybrids in the cytosol and, to a lesser extent, in the nucleus (Fig. 1, D and E, and Fig. 2, A and B). As RNA:DNA hybrids can also form during replication of mitochondrial DNA (32.Xu B. Clayton D.A. RNA-DNA hybrid formation at the human mitochondrial heavy-strand origin ceases at replication start sites: an implication for RNA-DNA hybrids serving as primers.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3135-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we co-stained cells with the mitochondria-specific vital dye MitoTracker. Three-dimensional surface rendering of confocal images showed that the majority of RNA:DNA hybrids were localized outside of mitochondria (Fig. 1E). Pretreatment of cells with RNase H prior to S9.6 staining significantly reduced the cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrid staining (Fig. 1, D–F). Antibody S9.6 only partially co-stained with PicoGreen (Fig. 1G), suggesting that PicoGreen stains cytosolic dsDNA and RNA:DNA hybrids in A549 cells. Consistent with this possibility, staining of A549 cells using a dsDNA-specific antibody showed the presence of cytosolic dsDNA, which partially co-localized with the cytosolic PicoGreen staining (Fig. 2C). In summary, our data show that RNA:DNA hybrids are constitutively present in the cytosol of all tested cells. RNA:DNA hybrids can occur during DNA transcription (33.Shaw N.N. Arya D.P. Recognition of the unique structure of DNA:RNA hybrids.Biochimie. 2008; 90: 1026-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, cytosolic DNA is transcribed by Pol III in the cytosol and potentially in the nucleus into an RNA:DNA hybrid and dsRNA intermediate (22.Chiu Y.H. Macmillan J.B. Chen Z.J. RNA polymerase III detects cytosolic DNA and induces type I interferons through the RIG-I pathway.Cell. 2009; 138: 576-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 23.Ablasser A.

Immunol. 2009; 10: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism by which cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids are generated and regulated, A549 cells were treated with Pol III inhibitors prior to staining with S9.6 or PicoGreen (34.Wu L. Pan J. Thoroddsen V. Wysong D.R. Blackman R.K. Bulawa C.E. Gould A.E. Ocain T.D. Dick L.R. Errada P. Dorr P.K. Parkinson T. Wood T. Kornitzer D. Weissman Z. Willis I.M. McGovern K. Novel small-molecule inhibitors of RNA polymerase III.Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Treatment of A549 cells with the Pol III inhibitor ML-60218 decreased the cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrid staining at doses above the published half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), but had no effect on nuclear PicoGreen staining and affected RNA:DNA hybrid staining at doses above IC50 (Fig. 3). Treatment of A549 cells with α-amanitin, a Pol II inhibitor, was toxic to cells compared with the Pol III inhibitor ML-60218. To investigate if the genetic inhibition of Pol III also reduced RNA:DNA hybrid levels, A549 cells were transfected with siRNA against POLR3G (siPOLR3G_1 and siPOLR3G_2), a subunit of the Pol III complex, or negative control siRNA. Knockdown of POLR3G protein expression resulted in the disappearance of cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids by immunofluorescence staining, consistent with reduced POLR3G mRNA gene expression (Fig. 4). In contrast, negative control siRNA did not affect cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrid levels or POLR3G expression. This corroborated with previous results of Pol III chemical inhibition, which decreased the presence of RNA:DNA hybrids. In contrast to Pol II, which is localized exclusively in the nucleus, a fraction of Pol III is present in the cytosol. To investigate if cytosolic Pol III contributes to the generation of RNA:DNA hybrids in the cytosol, we co-stained A549 cells for POLR3G, a subunit of the Pol III complex, and RNA:DNA hybrids (35.Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Three human RNA polymerase III-specific subunits form a subcomplex with a selective function in specific transcription initiation.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). No significant co-staining of POLR3G and S9.6 or PicoGreen was observed in the cytosol of A549 cells (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, POLR3G was localized largely in the nucleus, suggesting that the presence of cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids depends on nuclear Pol III activity. RNA:DNA hybrids can cause stalling of the replication fork and formation of dsDNA breaks (1.Aguilera A. García-Muse T. R loops: from transcription byproducts to threats to genome stability.Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2076434326,"Lung cancer is often refractory to radiotherapy, but molecular mechanisms of tumor resistance remain poorly defined. Here we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA5 is specifically overexpressed in lung cancer and is involved in regulating cellular responses to genotoxic insult. In the absence of EphA5, lung cancer cells displayed a defective G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, were unable to resolve DNA damage, and became radiosensitive. Upon irradiation, EphA5 was transported into the nucleus where it interacted with activated ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) at sites of DNA repair. Finally, we demonstrate that a new monoclonal antibody against human EphA5 sensitized lung cancer cells and human lung cancer xenografts to radiotherapy and significantly prolonged survival, thus suggesting the likelihood of translational applications.

The concept of targeted cancer therapy is predicated on the assumption that tumors have unique and sustained genetic abnormalities and that direct targeting of such distinctive biological features can only be accomplished through the identification and validation of certain specific molecular markers. These principles are particularly relevant to lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide (1.Ferlay J. Shin H.R. Bray F. Forman D. Mathers C. Parkin D.M.

For patients with early stage disease, surgical resection or primary radiotherapy are generally the standard treatments, whereas combined modality therapy (radiation plus chemotherapy, with or without surgery) is preferred for locally advanced disease (4.Herbst R.S.

Such complex signaling cascades have traditionally been divided into two major protein kinase pathways: one primarily mediated by the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase protein and the other primarily mediated by ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and rad-3-related) kinase (7.Cimprich K.A.

Once activated, ATM phosphorylates several downstream substrates, including p53 and Mdm2, molecular modifications that lead to IR-induced arrest of cells in G1, S, or G2 cell cycle phases (10.Xu B.

Cells that are functionally defective in components of the DDR pathways show cell cycle checkpoint defects, a decreased capacity to repair DNA, and an increased sensitivity to IR and other DNA damaging agents (6.Jackson S.P.

We searched for new molecular targets specific for human tumors by high throughput combinatorial screening of a phage-displayed random peptide library to classify human tumor cell lines according to the binding selectivity of recovered peptide motifs (14.Kolonin M.G.

One group of tumor cell-binding peptides exhibited targeting specificity for human lung cancer cells. Identification of some of these binding peptides led to the suggestion that the corresponding candidate surface receptor was likely the RTK EphA5 (14.Kolonin M.G. Bover L. Sun J. Zurita A.J. Do K.A.

Here, we identify EphA5 as a molecular target of lung cancer and as a novel regulator of IR-induced cell cycle checkpoint and DNA damage repair, with unexpected roles in the resistance of lung cancer to radiotherapy. In addition, we produced a new monoclonal antibody against EphA5 that sensitizes lung cancer cells to IR in vitro and improves the overall survival of mice bearing human lung cancer xenografts in combination with radiation therapy. These findings present a readily available and potentially effective strategy for the detection and treatment of lung cancer. NU/NU nude mice and Balb/c mice (Harlan Laboratories) were housed in the animal facility of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Nude rats were also purchased from Harlan Laboratories and housed in the animal facility of MPI Research. The imaging studies in nude rats were conducted at MPI Research (Boston, MA) and were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. MPI Research is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. The facility maintains an Animal Welfare Assurance statement with the National Institutes of Health Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. To ensure compliance, the protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee before any investigational work was conducted. The following reagents were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-EphA5 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, clone L15), rabbit monoclonal anti-ATM IgG (Millipore, clone Y170), rabbit polyclonal anti-ATM (Millipore), mouse monoclonal anti-ATM IgG (Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ATM IgG (Ser1981) (Millipore, clone 10H11.E12), rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-Chk2 IgG (Cell Signaling), rabbit monoclonal anti-Chk2 IgG (Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine HRP-conjugated antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and goat polyclonal anti-GST antibodies (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated, rabbit anti-goat HRP-conjugated, and rabbit anti-mouse HRP-conjugated IgGs, and ChromPure mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Alexa Fluor® 488 rabbit anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Invitrogen. Cy-3- and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse and rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Recombinant human EphA5 extracellular domain was purchased from R&D Systems. The complete EphA5 cytoplasmic domain (Cellsciences) and EphA5 kinase domain (Millipore) were also obtained commercially. 293GPG cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. NCI-H460, H1299, A549, NCI-H226, NCI-H23, and NCI-H522 human lung cancer cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. After lentiviral infection, stably transfected cells were selected and maintained in medium containing puromycin (Sigma) or puromycin plus blasticidin (Sigma). Normal human pulmonary fibroblasts were obtained from PromoCell and were cultured in supplemented fibroblast growth medium (PromoCell). Hybridomas were kept in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Human EPHA5 targeting shRNA (TRCN0000006413, referred to as EphA5-shRNA1 and TRCN0000006415, referred to as EphA5-shRNA2) cloned into the retroviral pLKO.1 vector were purchased from the TRC lentiviral shRNA library (Open Biosystems). Ready to use lentiviral particles expressing a validated p53-shRNA (LVP343-GB) or the human gene TP53 (LVP253, NM_000546), and lentiviral controls (LVP-Null-RB and LVP-Ctr-GB) were purchased from AMSbio (Lake Forest, CA). EPHA5-shRNA lentiviruses were produced by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney cells (293FT; Invitrogen) with the sequence-verified pLKO.1 vector containing the EPHA5-shRNA sequence. Forty-eight hours later, the viral supernatant was collected, filtered to remove cellular debris, and aliquoted. Cells plated at 70% confluence in 6-well plates were infected with lentiviruses, and after 16 h, the virus-containing medium was removed and replaced with normal growth medium. Stably transduced cells were selected by addition of either puromycin (2 μg/ml) or blasticidin (60 μg/ml) to the growth medium. Rescue of EphA5 expression in EphA5-silenced cells was performed with an expression vector containing the human EphA5 receptor cDNA ORF (NM_004439.6), purchased from Origene (RG213206). The EphA5 cDNA was digested with AsiSI (NEB, R0630S) and MluI (NEB, R0198S) restriction enzymes and subcloned into a compatible pLenti-C-TurboGFP expression vector system (Origene, PS100065). Lentiviral particles containing the EphA5 cDNA were prepared following the protocol described previously. H460 EphA5-shRNA or NT-shRNA were plated in 6-well plates and transduced with the virus containing either the EphA5 expression vector or empty vector. Transduced cells were sorted based on expression of GFP. EphA5 expression was confirmed by immunoblotting. Extraction of total protein was performed with Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40). For immunoprecipitation assays, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer and, after overnight incubation with antibody-loaded magnetic beads (2 mg of total protein/1 μg of antibody), washed extensively in wash buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40). For protein detection by immunoblotting, proteins were resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE® Novex Bris-Tris gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), blocked with PBS containing 5% nonfat milk, incubated with primary antibody, washed, incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. Fractionation of DNA-associated proteins was performed as follows: nonirradiated control cells or cells treated with IR were washed once with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 340 mm sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After a short incubation period, nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 5 min and washed once with extraction buffer. Nuclear proteins were resuspended in a second extraction buffer (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Soluble and insoluble fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 1,700 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Finally, the pellet containing insoluble proteins was resuspended in extraction buffer and sonicated. Two sets of total RNA were independently isolated from cells with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). For DNA synthesis, 500 ng of RNA from each sample were denatured at 70 °C for 5 min and quickly chilled on ice. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out for 2 h at 42 °C with the ImProm-IITM reverse transcription system (Promega). Quantitative real time PCR analysis was performed in a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System instrument (Applied Biosystems). Probes were as follows: Hs00178313_m1 for EPHA1, Hs00171656_m1 for EPHA2, Hs00739096_m1 for EPHA3, Hs00177874_m1 for EPHA4, Hs00300724_m1 for EPHA5, Hs00297133_m1 for EPHA6, Hs00177891_m1 for EPHA7, Hs01025610_m1 for EPHA8, Hs00543478_m1 for EPHA10, Hs00358886_m1 for EFNA1, Hs01023290_m1 for EFNA2, Hs00191913_m1 for EFNA3, Hs00193299_m1 for EFNA4, Hs00157342_m1 for EFNA5, Hs00270004_m1 for EFNB1, Hs00970625_m1 for EFNB2, Hs00154861_m1 for EFNB3, Hs01057849_m1 for EPHB1, Hs00362096_m1 for EPHB2, Hs00177903_m1 for EPHB3, Hs00174752_m1 for EPHB4, and Hs01071144_m1 for EPHB6. The gene expression ratio was normalized to that of 18 S. Cells were suspended at the concentration of 5000 cells/2 ml of 0.35% low melting agarose in a 35-mm culture dish containing 0.7% agarose base. Triplicates were prepared for each tested cell line and inspected by eye after staining with crystal violet for colony formation after incubation at 37 °C for 14–21 days. Immunocapture of ATM and pATM was performed with Reacti-bind protein A plates (Pierce) coated with anti-pATM, anti-ATM, or IgG control antibodies, as described (23.Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Kain R. Lahdenranta J. Sakamoto M. Stryhn A. Ashmun R.A. Shapiro L.H. Arap W. Ruoslahti E. Aminopeptidase N is a receptor for tumor-homing peptides and a target for inhibiting angiogenesis.Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 722-727PubMed Google Scholar). ELISA with anti-IgG confirmed equal molar concentrations of IgG in each of the wells. After a blocking step with PBS containing 3% BSA, 30 μg of protein from total cell extracts was added to the wells for overnight incubation at 4 °C. After gentle washes, tagged EphA5 constructs were added to each well; after overnight incubation and several washes in PBS, the assay was developed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies against the tags. Solution binding assays were performed in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20). For each experiment, EphA5 constructs were incubated with anti-pATM or anti-ATM antibodies or control IgG-coupled magnetic beads in 500 μl of binding buffer overnight at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation period, beads were collected by centrifugation, and unbound proteins in the supernatant were collected by removal of 28 μl from the meniscus (corresponding to the unbound fraction). After two washes with 500 μl of binding buffer, the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of buffer. All samples were processed by the addition of sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved on NuPAGE® gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Cells were removed and plated sparsely on 6-well plates (Falcon) (250 or 500 cells/well) or 100 × 15mm Petri dishes (BD Falcon) (5,000 cells/dish) and were exposed to the specified doses of IR. Ten days later, cells were fixed and stained in 50% methanol in water containing 0.5% crystal violet to facilitate counting of colonies (≥50 cells). Clonogenic survival was calculated for each IR dose after normalizing for plating efficiency. The surviving fraction is the plating efficiency of treated cells divided by the plating efficiency of controls multiplied by 100. Cells were plated in 16-well chambers (Lab-Tek®) at 10,000 cell/well. After overnight incubation, cells were treated with 3 Gy of IR and fixed in methanol at different time points after irradiation. Cells were blocked for 2 h with 1% BSA in PBS, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA in PBS. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies and diluted in 1% BSA in PBS. Cells were washed three times with PBS and were mounted with mounting reagent containing DAPI (Vectashield, Vector Labs). Cells were viewed under a 60× oil immersion objective. Images were recorded, pseudo-colored, and merged. For quantification, ATM foci in the nuclei of at least 50 cells (random fields) were counted under the microscope for each experimental condition. Cells were partially synchronized in 0.2% BSA in DMEM and were stimulated with 10% FBS 24 h prior to IR treatment. For evaluation of DNA content, cells were treated, removed, and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol during vortexing. Approximately 30 min before analysis, cells were incubated in a solution of PBS containing 1% BSA and 50 μm propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed on a FACSCanto II instrument (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle analysis was performed using the FlowJo DNA/Cell Cycle platform. Staining of subconfluent cultured cells with a β-gal staining kit (Cell Signaling) was performed 7 days after treatment with IR (5 Gy). Percentages of SA-β-gal-positive cells were determined by scoring 3,000 cells (three independent fields of 1,000 cell each), in two independent experiments. For evaluation of senescence in vivo, tumor samples were collected 10 days after the end of IR treatments. Tissue samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, embedded in OCT, and sectioned immediately. Tissue sections were stained with the same β-gal staining kit and counterstained with eosin. Percentages of SA-β-gal-positive cells were determined by scoring 1,000 cells in triplicate (three independent fields, for a total of 3,000 cells scored). Five tumors were evaluated for each experimental group. Balb/c mice were immunized three times at 14-day intervals with 12 μg of recombinant extracellular EphA5 dissolved in complete Freund's adjuvant. Sera collected from tail veins were tested by ELISA after the third immunization. Splenocytes of mice with high antibody titers were fused with mouse myeloma cells (P3X63Ag8.653, American Type Culture Collection) (4:1 ratio) with polyethylene glycol (molecular weight = 1500; Sigma). After fusion, cells were cultured in 96-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well in RPMI 1640 selection medium containing 20% FBS, 10% hybridoma supplements (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 mg/ml streptomycin SO4, 10 mm HEPES, and hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (Sigma). Selected hybridomas were subcloned four times by limiting dilution. Conditional media were removed from each stable hybridoma culture. The Ig class of mAb was determined with a mouse mAb isotyping kit (Santa Cruz). ELISA, flow cytometry, and immunoprecipitation were used to characterize the monoclonal antibody 11C12. The epitope recognized by 11C12 was determined by peptide mapping and ELISA. In brief, GST-tagged peptides covering residues 304–467 of the extracellular portion of human EphA5 were produced and purified using a GST-tagged protein purification kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Purified GST peptides were coated on a 96-well plate and blocked with BSA followed by addition of decreasing concentrations of 11C12. Recombinant human EphA5 was used as positive control. Binding to GST alone was used to adjust for nonspecific interactions. Antibody internalization was evaluated by confocal microscopy. In brief, cells were placed in eight-well confocal chamber slides and were exposed to various concentrations of 11C12 or controls at 4 °C to allow for binding to the cell surface. After 30 min, cells were washed extensively and transferred to 37 °C for internalization. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the appropriate secondary reagents. Receptor degradation was evaluated by immunoblotting. Cells were treated with 1 μg/ml of 11C12 or control IgG and collected after 30 min and 1, 3, 6, and 24 h of treatment. Nontreated cells were also used as control. EphA5 immunostaining was performed on an autostainer (Dako Corporation). Human non-small cell lung cancer TMA specimens were from the Lung Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence Tissue Bank at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (24.Prudkin L. Behrens C. Liu D.D. Zhou X. Ozburn N.C. Bekele B.N. Minna J.D. Moran C. Roth J.A. Ji L. Wistuba I.I. Loss and reduction of FUS1 protein expression is a frequent phenomenon in the pathogenesis of lung cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Prior to the construction of the TMA, tumor tissue specimens of 198 lung cancers (125 ACC and 73 SCC) were examined histologically and were classified according to the WHO system. Detailed clinical and pathologic information, including demographic data, smoking history, pathologic tumor node metastasis staging, overall survival, and time of recurrence, was available in most cases. Hematoxylin was used for counterstaining. Immunohistochemical expression of EphA5 was quantified by two expert lung cancer pathologists (I. I. W. and M. I. N.) according to a four-value intensity score (0 for negative, 1 for weak, 2 for moderate, and 3 for strong), and the percentage of tumor cells within each category was independently estimated (0–100%). A final score was obtained by multiplying both intensity and extension values (0 × % negative tumor cells + 1 × % weakly stained tumor cells + 2 × % moderately stained tumor cells + 3 × % strongly stained tumor cells). Thus, the score ranged from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 300. Evaluation of EphA5 expression in a second cohort of patients that had previously been treated with radiotherapy was also performed. All patient information and materials were collected and handled in accordance with institutional review board-approved protocols and procedures. Patients with stage IIB-IIIB non-small cell lung carcinoma treated with primary lobectomy or pneumonectomy followed by postoperative radiotherapy at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1998 to 2005 were considered for inclusion. Patients receiving radiation doses less than 50 Gy, with positive surgical margins or without surgical mediastinal lymph node evaluation, were excluded. After cross-referencing for archived tissue materials, there were 23 patients available for further analysis. Individual patient medical records were reviewed for pertinent demographic and treatment outcome data. Locoregional relapse was defined as biopsy-proven recurrence within the radiation field. After immunohistochemistry for EphA5 was performed, the cohort was divided into high versus low EphA5 expression on the basis of scores at or above versus below the median score (median = 130) for the group. Cumulative rates of locoregional relapse were plotted, and log rank analysis to detect differences between the groups was performed. Overall survival was estimated for the cohort as a function of EphA5 staining by Kaplan-Meier methodology, with the use of log rank analysis to detect differences between the groups (SPSS version 17). Gamma radiation was delivered locally to the tumors from a 60Co source, at the rate of 1 Gy/min with a custom head and body shielding. Tumor-bearing mice received fractionated radiation therapy of 3 Gy a day for 3 consecutive days, 6 h after treatment with either 11C12 or control IgG (5 mg/kg each). Control groups received vehicle alone or 11C12 alone. Tumor volumes were determined from digital caliper measurements and are reported as mean tumor volumes ± S.D. Radiolabeling of 11C12 and control IgG was performed by inviCRO (Boston, MA). For DTPA conjugation, 30-kDa Amicon filter units were used to exchange 1 mg of IgG into a sodium bicarbonate buffer. This buffer exchange step was repeated five times. One mg of IgG was added directly to 500 μg of DTPA in a CryoVial tube and mixed by vortexing. The reaction was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction mixture was exchanged into 0.6 m ammonium acetate buffer with 30-kDa Amicon filter units. The product was rinsed five times with 0.6 m ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) and was stored at 4 °C. For labeling of DTPA-IgG with 111In, 0.6 m ammonium acetate buffer was added to 111InCl3 until the solution reached pH 6.5. Approximately 5 mCi of 111In was added to a CryoVial tube containing 0.2 mg of DTPA-IgG, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Following incubation, 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer containing 50 mm EDTA was added to the reaction tube. The reaction mixture was exchanged into PBS with a 30-kD"
https://openalex.org/W2156756837,"Rapid advances in mass spectrometry have allowed for estimates of absolute concentrations across entire proteomes, permitting the interrogation of many important biological questions. Here, we focus on a quantitative aspect of human cancer cell metabolism that has been limited by a paucity of available data on the abundance of metabolic enzymes. We integrate data from recent measurements of absolute protein concentration to analyze the statistics of protein abundance across the human metabolic network. At a global level, we find that the enzymes in glycolysis comprise approximately half of the total amount of metabolic proteins and can constitute up to 10% of the entire proteome. We then use this analysis to investigate several outstanding problems in cancer metabolism, including the diversion of glycolytic flux for biosynthesis, the relative contribution of nitrogen assimilating pathways, and the origin of cellular redox potential. We find many consistencies with current models, identify several inconsistencies, and find generalities that extend beyond current understanding. Together our results demonstrate that a relatively simple analysis of the abundance of metabolic enzymes was able to reveal many insights into the organization of the human cancer cell metabolic network."
https://openalex.org/W2089101124,"Background To investigate the effects of age and sex on the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and the prevalence and control status of diabetes mellitus (DM) in Korean adults. Methods Data came from 16,175 adults (6,951 men and 9,227 women) over the age of 30 who participated in the 2008-2010 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. SES was measured by household income or education level. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the prevalence or control status of diabetes were calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses across household income quartiles and education levels. Results The household income-DM and education level-DM relationships were significant in younger age groups for both men and women. The adjusted ORs and 95% CI for diabetes were 1.51 (0.97, 2.34) and 2.28 (1.29, 4.02) for the lowest vs. highest quartiles of household income and education level, respectively, in women younger than 65 years of age (both P for linear trend < 0.05 with Bonferroni adjustment). The adjusted OR and 95% CI for diabetes was 2.28 (1.53, 3.39) for the lowest vs. highest quartile of household income in men younger than 65 (P for linear trend < 0.05 with Bonferroni adjustment). However, in men and women older than 65, no associations were found between SES and the prevalence of DM. No significant association between SES and the status of glycemic control was detected. Conclusions We found age- and sex-specific differences in the relationship of household income and education with the prevalence of DM in Korea. DM preventive care is needed for groups with a low SES, particularly in young or middle-aged populations."
https://openalex.org/W2148401279,"Introduction Osteoarthritis of the knee affects millions of people. Elastic knee sleeves aim at relieving symptoms. While symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated as a consequence of elastic knee sleeves, evidence for biomechanical alterations only exists for the sagittal plane. We therefore asked what effect an elastic knee sleeve would have on frontal plane gait biomechanics. Methods 18 subjects (8 women, 10 men) with osteoarthritis of the medial tibiofemoral joint walked over ground with and without an elastic knee sleeve. Kinematics and forces were recorded and joint moments were calculated using an inverse dynamics approach. Conditions with sleeve and without sleeve were compared with paired t-Tests. Results With the sleeve, knee adduction angle at ground contact was reduced by 1.9±2.1° (P = 0.006). Peak knee adduction was reduced by 1.5±1.6° (P = 0.004). The first peak knee adduction moment and positive knee adduction impulse were decreased by 10.1% (0.74±0.9 Nm•kg-1; P = 0.002) and 12.9% (0.28±0.3 Nm•s•kg-1; P < 0.004), respectively. Conclusion Our study provides evidence that wearing an elastic knee sleeve during walking can reduce knee adduction angles, moments and impulse in subjects with knee osteoarthritis. As a higher knee adduction moment has previously been identified as a risk factor for disease progression in patients with medial knee osteoarthritis, we speculate that wearing a knee sleeve may be beneficial for this specific subgroup."
https://openalex.org/W2019788543,"The article reports the radiocarbon investigation results of the Lebombo Eco Trail tree, a representative African baobab from Mozambique. Several wood samples collected from the large inner cavity and from the outer part of the tree were investigated by AMS radiocarbon dating. According to dating results, the age values of all samples increase from the sampling point with the distance into the wood. For samples collected from the cavity walls, the increase of age values with the distance into the wood (up to a point of maximum age) represents a major anomaly. The only realistic explanation for this anomaly is that such inner cavities are, in fact, natural empty spaces between several fused stems disposed in a ring-shaped structure. We named them false cavities. Several important differences between normal cavities and false cavities are presented. Eventually, we dated other African baobabs with false inner cavities. We found that this new architecture enables baobabs to reach large sizes and old ages. The radiocarbon date of the oldest sample was 1425 ± 24 BP, which corresponds to a calibrated age of 1355 ± 15 yr. The dating results also show that the Lebombo baobab consists of five fused stems, with ages between 900 and 1400 years; these five stems build the complete ring. The ring and the false cavity closed 800–900 years ago. The results also indicate that the stems stopped growing toward the false cavity over the past 500 years."
https://openalex.org/W2077677583,"There is increasing evidence implicating human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) in several types of cancer. However, the development of targeted therapies to inactivate HER3 function has been a challenging endeavor. Its kinase domain functions in allostery not catalysis, and the classical ATP-analog class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors fail to inactivate it. Here we describe a novel approach that eliminates HER3 expression. The small-molecule cotransin CT8 binds the Sec61 translocon and prevents the signal peptide of the nascent HER3 protein from initiating its cotranslational translocation, resulting in the degradation of HER3 but not the other HER proteins. CT8 treatment suppresses the induction of HER3 that accompanies lapatinib treatment of HER2-amplified cancers and synergistically enhances the apoptotic effects of lapatinib. The target selectivities of cotransins are highly dependent on their structure and the signal sequence of targeted proteins and can be narrowed through structure-function studies. Targeting Sec61-dependent processing identifies a novel strategy to eliminate HER3 function."
https://openalex.org/W2057911349,"Cullin 3 (Cul3)-family ubiquitin ligases use the BTB-domain-containing proteins for the recruitment of substrates, but the regulation of this family of ubiquitin ligases has not been completely understood. KLHL20 is a BTB-family protein and targets tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) to its kelch-repeat domain for ubiquitination and degradation. Here, we show that another BTB-kelch protein KLHL39 is recruited to the substrate-binding domain of KLHL20 but is not a substrate of Cul3-KLHL20 complex. Interestingly, KLHL39 does not bind Cul3 because of the absence of certain conserved residues in the BTB domain. Instead, KLHL39 blocks KLHL20-mediated ubiquitination of PML and DAPK by disrupting the binding of these substrates to KLHL20 as well as the binding of KLHL20 to Cul3. Through the two mechanisms, KLHL39 increases the stability of PML and DAPK. In human colon cancers, downregulations of KLHL39, PML and DAPK are associated with metastatic progression. Furthermore, preclinical data indicate that KLHL39 promotes colon cancer migration, invasion and survival in vitro and metastasis in vivo through a PML- and DAPK-dependent mechanism. Our study identifies KLHL39 as a negative regulator of Cul3-KLHL20 ubiquitin ligase and reveals a role of KLHL39-mediated PML and DAPK stabilization in colon cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2009609863,"Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder with an unclear etiology. This study aims to investigate the role of IL-23/Th17 pathway in patients with ITP.The gene expressions of IL-17, IL-23 and their receptors in ITP patients and healthy controls were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. ELISA was used to test the IL-17 and IL-23 levels in plasma. Flow cytometry was used to detect the frequency of Th17 cells. The correlation between plasma IL-23 and IL-17 levels, Th17 cells, platelets were analyzed. The level of Th17-related cytokines was measured by ELISA following stimulation with IL-23. Subsequently, the IL-23 and IL-17 levels were measured in patients post-treatment.The PBMCs of ITP patients showed increased mRNA expression levels in each of the following: IL-23p19, IL-12p40, IL-23R, IL-12Rβ1, IL-17A, IL-17F, and RORC. In addition, elevated Th17 cells and plasma IL-17, IL-23 levels were also observed in these ITP patients. Furthermore, it was found that IL-23 levels in plasma are positively correlated with IL-17 levels and Th17 cells, yet negatively correlated with platelet count. Following IL-23 stimulation in vitro, IL-17 levels showed significant elevation. Furthermore, both IL-23 and IL-17 levels decreased after effective treatment.The IL-23/Th17 pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of ITP through enhancement of the Th17 response. Moreover, our results suggest that the IL-23/Th17 pathway is a potential therapeutic target in future attempts of ITP treatment."

The areas that exhibited blood vessel formation were estimated by immunostaining the cultures with an antitibody against CD31, a blood vessel marker. We also performed microarray gene-expression analysis and selected one molecule, angiopoietin-like 7 (ANGPTL7) for further functional studies conducted with the keratocytes and in vivo in mice.Areas showing blood vessel formation in normal serum-free medium were conditions were markedly smaller when HUVECs were co-cultured with corneal keratocytes than when they were co-cultured with the dermal fibroblasts under the same conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that ANGPTL7 expression was higher in keratocytes than in dermal fibroblasts. In vitro, inhibiting ANGPTL7 expression by using a specific siRNA led to greater tube formation than did the transfection of cells with a control siRNA, and this increase in tube formation was abolished when recombinant ANGPTL7 protein was added to the cultures. In vivo, intrastromal injections of an ANGPTL7 PshRNA into the avascular corneal stroma of mice resulted in the growth of blood vessels.ANGPTL7, which is abundantly expressed in keratocytes, plays a major role in maintaining corneal avascularity and transparency."
https://openalex.org/W2036123648,"Interferon gamma (IFNg) has been known as the regulator for both tumor immune surveillance and tumorgenesis. However, mechanisms underlying the resistance of tumor cell to IFNg have yet been fully understood. In the current study, we showed that immunity-related GTPase family member 1 (mouse: Irgm1; human: IRGM) is essential for IFNg-mediated regulation of tumor cell growth in melanoma. IRGM/Irgm1 was highly expressed in human and mouse melanoma. IFNg and starvation synergistically induced Irgm1 expression in melanoma B16 cells. In vivo, injection of Irgm1-siRNA-treated cells significantly reduced the number of tumor nodules and prolonged the mice survival. In vitro, knockdown endogenous or IFNg-induced Irgm1 significantly decreases the proliferation and increases apoptosis of B16 cells. In addition, suppressing Irgm1 decreased the IFNg/starvation-induced autophagy, while overexpressing Irgm1 significantly increased autophagy and rescued starvation-challenged cells. Moreover, IFNg and starvation-induced the co-localization of Irgm1 with Bax-interacting factor 1 (Bif-1). Knockdown of Bif-1 decreased Irgm1-mediated tumor cell autophagy. Taken together, these data reveal an Irgm1-dependent mechanism that promotes the tumorigenesis of melanoma via dual regulation of apoptosis and Bif-1-dependent autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2057998607,"Plant genetic variation and herbivores can both influence ecosystem functioning by affecting the quantity and quality of leaf litter. Few studies have, however, investigated the effects of herbivore load on litter decomposition at plant genotype level. We reduced insect herbivory using an insecticide on one half of field-grown Betula Pendula saplings of 17 genotypes, representing random intrapopulation genetic variation, and allowed insects to naturally colonize the other half. We hypothesized that due to induced herbivore defence, saplings under natural herbivory produce litter of higher concentrations of secondary metabolites (terpenes and soluble phenolics) and have slower litter decomposition rate than saplings under reduced herbivory. We found that leaf damage was 89 and 53% lower in the insecticide treated saplings in the summer and autumn surveys, respectively, which led to 73% higher litter production. Litter decomposition rate was also affected by herbivore load, but the effect varied from positive to negative among genotypes and added up to an insignificant net effect at the population level. In contrast to our hypothesis, concentrations of terpenes and soluble phenolics were higher under reduced than natural herbivory. Those genotypes, whose leaves were most injured by herbivores, produced litter of lowest mass loss, but unlike we expected, the concentrations of terpenes and soluble phenolics were not linked to either leaf damage or litter decomposition. Our results show that (1) the genetic and herbivore effects on B. pendula litter decomposition are not mediated through variation in terpene or soluble phenolic concentrations and suggest that (2) the presumably higher insect herbivore pressure in the future warmer climate will not, at the ecological time scale, affect the mean decomposition rate in genetically diverse B. pendula populations. However, (3) due to the significant genetic variation in the response of decomposition to herbivory, evolutionary changes in mean decomposition rate are possible."
https://openalex.org/W2094634275,"Certain predisposition factors such as BRCA1/2 and CHEK2 mutations cause familial breast cancers that occur early. In China, breast cancers are diagnosed at relatively younger age, and higher percentage of patients are diagnosed before 40 years, than that in Caucasians. However, the prevalence for BRCA1/2 mutations and reported CHEK2 germline mutations is much lower or absent in Chinese population, arguing for the need to study other novel risk alleles among Chinese breast cancer patients. In this study, we searched for CHEK2 mutations in young, high-risk breast cancer patients in China and detected a missense variant Y390C (1169A>G) in 12 of 150 patients (8.0%) and 2 in 250 healthy controls (0.8%, P=0.0002). Four of the Y390C carriers have family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. In patients without family history, Y390C carriers tend to develop breast cancer early, before 35 years of age. The codon change at Y390, a highly conserved residue located in CHEK2’s kinase domain, appeared to significantly impair CHEK2 activity. Functional analysis suggested that the CHEK2 Y390C mutation is deleterious as judged by the mutant protein’s inability to inactivate CDC25A or to activate p53 after DNA damage. Cells expressing the CHEK2 Y390C variant showed impaired p21 and Puma expression after DNA damage, and the deregulated cell cycle checkpoint and apoptotic response may help conserve mutations and therefore contribute to tumorigeneisis. Taken together, our results not only identified a novel CHEK2 allele that is associated with cancer families and confers increased breast cancer risk, but also showed that this allele significantly impairs CHEK2 function during DNA damage response. Our results provide further insight on how the function of such an important cancer gene may be impaired by existing mutations to facilitate tumorigenesis. It also offers a new subject for breast cancer monitoring, prevention and management."

However, the downstream mediators are still elusive. In particular, the role of extracellular mediators is largely unknown. In this study, we identified the matricellular protein Cyr61, which is de novo synthesized in response to PDGF stimulation, as the key downstream mediator of the ERK and JNK pathways, independent of the p38 MAPK and AKT pathways, and, thereby, it mediates PDGF-induced smooth muscle cell migration but not proliferation.

The proto-oncogene int-1 encodes a secreted protein associated with the extracellular matrix.EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Cell migration was performed by trypsinizing SMCs and plating them onto transwell migration plates (Corning, New York, NY) for migration assays. 2 × 105 cells were added to the upper chamber. Cells were allowed to migrate through filters (8-μm pore size) precoated on both sides with gelatin in the presence of either medium (600 μl) alone or medium with PDGF-BB at designated concentrations in the lower chamber. Cell migration was carried out at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 h. Cells remaining on the upper surface of the filter were carefully removed by mechanical scraping. Cells migrated to the lower side were fixed with methanol and then stained with Harris H&E. The cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filter were counted in four random objective fields (×200 magnification) using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. SMCs were grown in 60-mm dishes. After 24 h of starvation, the culture medium was removed, and SMCs were rinsed with PBS twice. Adherent cells were incubated in 2.0 mm DTSSP (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature (23.García A.J. Vega M.D. Boettiger D. Modulation of cell proliferation and differentiation through substrate-dependent changes in fibronectin conformation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 785-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Unreacted cross-linker was quenched for 15 min by addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 20 mm. After quenching, samples were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against integrins α6, β1, and β3 or Cyr61. Mouse aortic SMCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. SMCs were infected for 24 h with either Ad-CMV-null adenovirus or Ad-CMV-mCyr61 adenovirus (Vector Biolabs, Philadelphia, PA). After infection, cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (1% CHAPSO, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture). After sonication for 20 s, total cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris, and the supernatants were incubated with Cyr61 antibody for 3 h with rotation at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added and incubated with rotation overnight at 4 °C. After washing five times with cold PBS, the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with either Cyr61 antibody or specific integrin antibody. SMC proliferation was determined as described previously (24.Chai Y.C. Howe P.H. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. Oxidized low density lipoprotein and lysophosphatidylcholine stimulate cell cycle entry in vascular smooth muscle cells. Evidence for release of fibroblast growth factor-2.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17791-17797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with non-silencing or Cyr61 siRNA for 48 h. After 24-h starvation, SMCs were stimulated with or without PDGF-BB for 24 h. During the last 6-h incubation period, cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml methyl-[3H]thymidine. After labeling, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and two times with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was hydrolyzed by 0.25 N NaOH, and radioactivity was assayed in a liquid scintillation counter. The proliferation of SMCs was assessed by determination of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Results are means ± S.E. Comparisons between multiple groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance with post-hoc Student's t tests. Single comparisons were made using two-tailed, unpaired Student's t tests. A p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To test our hypothesis that Cyr61 has a function in the PDGF signaling pathway, we first tested whether PDGF influences Cyr61 expression in SMCs. Cultured mouse aortic SMCs were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB for various time periods. Cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and Cyr61 protein expression was determined by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, we found that PDGF-BB markedly induced Cyr61 protein expression (over 17-fold), peaking at around 1 h. PDGF-BB induction of Cyr61 was in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). At concentrations above 2.5 ng/ml, PDGF-BB significantly induced Cyr61 protein expression. These data suggest a role of Cyr61 in PDGF-induced cellular function. Because it is well known that PDGF induces SMC migration and proliferation, we determined whether PDGF-induced Cyr61 mediates these functions. When Cyr61 expression was knocked down successfully (Fig. 1C) with specific siRNA, we observed a significant blockage of PDGF-induced cell migration (Fig. 1D) (60–70% inhibition in all PDGF concentration ranges used). In contrast, knockdown of Cyr61 expression had no detectable effect on PDGF-induced cell proliferation (Fig. 1E). Therefore, these data reveal a novel and specific role for Cyr61 in the PDGF signaling pathway. That is, Cyr61 regulates PDGF-induced cell migration rather than proliferation. We also observed that knockdown of Cyr61 expression has no significant effect on either expression or phosphorylation of PDGF receptor β (Fig. 1F), indicating that Cyr61 has influence downstream of the PDGF-BB receptor. The effect of the endogenously produced Cyr61 on SMC migration and proliferation was assessed further by overexpression of Cyr61 by adenovirus infection (Fig. 1, G–I). We observed that overexpression of Cyr61 enhances SMC migration (Fig. 1H) but has no significant effect on SMC proliferation (Fig. 1I). These data further support the role of Cyr61 in PDGF-induced SMC migration. To determine the molecular basis that mediates Cyr61 expression, we assessed whether activation of MAPKs or AKT has a role in Cyr61 expression because these kinases have been implicated in PDGF-induced cell migration (9.Graf K. Xi X.P. Yang D. Fleck E. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E.

Role of JNK, p38, and ERK in platelet-derived growth factor-induced vascular proliferation, migration, and gene expression.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We first measured the activation of MEK, ERK, JNK, p38, and Akt stimulated by PDGF-BB in mouse primary SMCs. As shown in Fig. 2A, the activation of MEK, ERK, JNK, and p38 in response to PDGF-BB was dramatic and transient, peaking around 2–15 min. However, AKT had a long-lasting activation, from 2 min to 1 h (Fig. 2A), suggesting a possible role of these kinases in regulating Cyr61 expression. We next examined the regulatory relationship between these kinases and Cyr61 expression. As shown in Fig. 2B, 10 μm U0126, a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, nearly completely blocked PDGF-induced Cyr61 expression. The same effect was also observed when the specific inhibitor of JNK (SP600125) was admitted. However, neither the specific inhibitor of p38, SB203580, nor the specific inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin and LY294002) had significant inhibitory effects on PDGF-induced Cyr61 expression (Fig. 2, B and C). These data indicate that activation of ERK and JNK are required for de novo Cyr61 synthesis, but neither p38 nor PI3K/AKT play a significant role in Cyr61 expression. We observed a dose-dependent inhibition of U0126 or SP600125 on PDGF-induced cell migration (Fig. 2, D and E). The level of inhibition of cell migration by either U0126 or SP600125 is consistent with the level of knockdown of Cyr61 expression (Fig. 1D), supporting the notion that the ERK and JNK pathways mediate Cyr61 expression, leading to cell migration. Although p38 and PI3K/AKT do not contribute to Cyr61 expression (Fig. 2, B and C), previous studies showed that both p38 and AKT contribute to SMC migration (10.Choudhury G.G. Karamitsos C. Hernandez J. Gentilini A. Bardgette J. Abboud H.E. PI-3-kinase and MAPK regulate mesangial cell proliferation and migration in response to PDGF.Am. J.

Biol. 2003; 23: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We were curious about whether newly synthesized Cyr61 has a feedback effect on the intracellular activation of p38 and AKT. The effect of knockdown of Cyr61 on the activation of p38 and AKT was determined. As shown in Fig. 2F, knockdown of Cyr61 expression has no detectable effect on the activation of p38 and AKT, indicating that PDGF-induced Cyr61 contributes to SMC migration via a p38- and AKT-independent pathway. To determine whether PDGF-BB-induced Cyr61 is located in the ECM, we assessed Cyr61 accumulation in ECM compared with that accumulated intracellularly. At various time points, cells stimulated with or without PDGF-BB were detached from the cell culture dishes with 1 mm EDTA. After removal of the cellular fraction, the ECM was collected by incubation in Laemmli sample buffer at 90 °C, followed by scraping of the dish as described previously (22.Bradley R.S. Brown A.M. The proto-oncogene int-1 encodes a secreted protein associated with the extracellular matrix.EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis from the paired groups of detached cell lysates (Fig. 3A) and ECM (Fig. 3B) indicated that the de novo synthesized Cyr61 was highly accumulated intracellularly at 1 h and disappeared after 4 h. Accompanying this dynamic intracellular process, Cyr61 started to accumulate in the ECM at 1 h, peaking around 1–2 h. Therefore, PDGF-BB-induced Cyr61 protein went through the intracellular pathway and was promptly secreted into the ECM compartment and bound to the matrix. Intracellular FAK activation is important in cell migration because it regulates the dynamics of cell adhesion, actin polymerization, and cytoskeleton reorganization (25.Tomar A. Schlaepfer D.D.

Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 26.Schaller M.D. Cellular functions of FAK kinases: insight into molecular mechanisms and novel functions.J.

Drug Delivery Rev. 2011; 63: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Several sites of tyrosine phosphorylation have been identified in FAK to mediate FAK activity or FAK interaction with SH2 domain-containing proteins. The major autophosphorylation site Tyr-397 is essential for the majority of FAK functions (28.Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Autophosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase, pp125FAK, directs SH2-dependent binding of pp60src.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Tyr-397, via other protein mediators, phosphorylates Tyr-576 and Tyr-577 in the activation loop of the FAK enzyme (29.Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase at sites in the catalytic domain regulates kinase activity: a role for Src family kinases.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Tyr-861 at the C-terminal domain (30.Calalb M.B. Zhang X. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Focal adhesion kinase tyrosine-861 is a major site of phosphorylation by Src.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We found that stimulation with PDGF induced biphasic activation of FAK. The first activation peak was weak and transient at 2 min of PDGF stimulation. A major late-phase FAK activation peaked at around 1–2 h (Fig. 4A). Strikingly, the late-phase FAK activation peak is concomitant with the extracellular matrix protein Cyr61 production peak. We hypothesized that Cyr61 mediates FAK activation in response to PDGF stimulation. To test our hypothesis, we examined whether depletion of Cyr61 using specific Cyr61 siRNA had an effect on FAK activation. As shown in Fig. 4B, down-regulation of Cyr61 effectively bloc"
https://openalex.org/W2037635899,"We examined the transcriptional regulation of the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein gene (Arc), focusing on BDNF-induced Arc expression in cultured rat cortical cells. Although the synaptic activity-responsive element (SARE), located −7 kbp upstream of the Arc transcription start site, responded to NMDA, BDNF, or FGF2, the proximal region of the promoter (Arc/−1679) was activated by BDNF or FGF2, but not by NMDA, suggesting the presence of at least two distinct Arc promoter regions, distal and proximal, that respond to extracellular stimuli. Specificity protein 4 (SP4) and early growth response 1 (EGR1) controlled Arc/−1679 transcriptional activity via the region encompassing −169 to −37 of the Arc promoter. We found that trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, significantly enhanced the inductive effects of BDNF or FGF2, but not those of NMDA on Arc expression. Inhibitors of class I/IIb HDACs, SAHA, and class I HDACs, MS-275, but not of class II HDACs, MC1568, enhanced BDNF-induced Arc expression. The enhancing effect of TSA was mediated by the region from −1027 to −1000 bp, to which serum response factor (SRF) and HDAC1 bound. The binding of HDAC1 to this region was reduced by TSA. Thus, Arc expression was suppressed by class I HDAC-mediated mechanisms via chromatin modification of the proximal promoter whereas the inhibition of HDAC allowed Arc expression to be markedly enhanced in response to BDNF or FGF2. These results contribute to our understanding of the physiological role of Arc expression in neuronal functions such as memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2072586700,"We tested functionality and acceptability of a wireless fetal monitoring prototype technology in pregnant women in an inpatient labor unit in the United States. Women with full-term singleton pregnancies and no evidence of active labor were asked to wear the prototype technology for 30 minutes. We assessed functionality by evaluating the ability to successfully monitor the fetal heartbeat for 30 minutes, transmit this data to Cloud storage and view the data on a web portal. Three obstetricians also rated fetal cardiotocographs on ease of readability. We assessed acceptability by administering closed and open-ended questions on perceived utility and likeability to pregnant women and clinicians interacting with the prototype technology. Thirty-two women were enrolled, 28 of whom (87.5%) successfully completed 30 minutes of fetal monitoring including transmission of cardiotocographs to the web portal. Four sessions though completed, were not successfully uploaded to the Cloud storage. Six non-study clinicians interacted with the prototype technology. The primary technical problem observed was a delay in data transmission between the prototype and the web portal, which ranged from 2 to 209 minutes. Delays were ascribed to Wi-Fi connectivity problems. Recorded cardiotocographs received a mean score of 4.2/5 (± 1.0) on ease of readability with an interclass correlation of 0.81(95%CI 0.45, 0.96). Both pregnant women and clinicians found the prototype technology likable (81.3% and 66.7% respectively), useful (96.9% and 66.7% respectively), and would either use it again or recommend its use to another pregnant woman (77.4% and 66.7% respectively). In this pilot study we found that this wireless fetal monitoring prototype technology has potential for use in a United States inpatient setting but would benefit from some technology changes. We found it to be acceptable to both pregnant women and clinicians. Further research is needed to assess feasibility of using this technology in busy inpatient settings."
https://openalex.org/W1484758850,"Purpose This study examines the subjective acceptance during UHF-CMR in a cohort of healthy volunteers who underwent a cardiac MR examination at 7.0T. Methods Within a period of two-and-a-half years (January 2012 to June 2014) a total of 165 healthy volunteers (41 female, 124 male) without any known history of cardiac disease underwent UHF-CMR. For the assessment of the subjective acceptance a questionnaire was used to examine the participants experience prior, during and after the UHF-CMR examination. For this purpose, subjects were asked to respond to the questionnaire in an exit interview held immediately after the completion of the UHF-CMR examination under supervision of a study nurse to ensure accurate understanding of the questions. All questions were answered with “yes” or “no” including space for additional comments. Results Transient muscular contraction was documented in 12.7% of the questionnaires. Muscular contraction was reported to occur only during periods of scanning with the magnetic field gradients being rapidly switched. Dizziness during the study was reported by 12.7% of the subjects. Taste of metal was reported by 10.1% of the study population. Light flashes were reported by 3.6% of the entire cohort. 13% of the subjects reported side effects/observations which were not explicitly listed in the questionnaire but covered by the question about other side effects. No severe side effects as vomiting or syncope after scanning occurred. No increase in heart rate was observed during the UHF-CMR exam versus the baseline clinical examination. Conclusions This study adds to the literature by detailing the subjective acceptance of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging examinations at a magnetic field strength of 7.0T. Cardiac MR examinations at 7.0T are well tolerated by healthy subjects. Broader observational and multi-center studies including patient cohorts with cardiac diseases are required to gain further insights into the subjective acceptance of UHF-CMR examinations."
https://openalex.org/W2029313848,"Retrograde degeneration of spiral ganglion cells in the cochlea following hair cell loss is similar to dying back in pathology. The EFR3A gene has recently been discovered to be involved in the pathogenesis of dying back. The relationship of EFR3A and spiral ganglion degeneration, however, was rarely investigated. In this study, we destroyed the hair cells of the mouse cochlea by co-administration of kanamycin and furosemide and then investigated the EFR3A expression during the induced spiral ganglion cell degeneration. Our results revealed that co-administration of kanamycin and furosemide quickly induced hair cell loss in the C57BL/6J mice and then resulted in progressive degeneration of the spiral ganglion beginning at day 5 following drug administration. The number of the spiral ganglion cells began to decrease at day 15. The expression of EFR3A increased remarkably in the spiral ganglion at day 5 and then decreased to near normal level within the next 10 days. Our study suggested that the change of EFR3A expression in the spiral ganglion was coincident with the time of the spiral ganglion degeneration, which implied that high expression of EFR3A may be important to prompt initiation of spiral ganglion degeneration following hair cell loss."

Med. 2007; 204: 865-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The generation of C57BL/6 mice with targeted deletion of GX sPLA2 (GX KO mice) has led to new insights into novel mechanisms by which GX sPLA2 modulates physiological processes. Our laboratory reported that GX KO mice fed a normal rodent diet gain more weight and exhibit increased adiposity compared with wild-type mice (9.Li X. Shridas P. Forrest K. Bailey W. Webb N.R. Group X secretory phospholipase A2 negatively regulates adipogenesis in murine models.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 4313-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We also determined that stromal vascular cells isolated from adipose tissue of GX KO mice accumulate significantly more triglyceride when induced to differentiate into adipocytes compared with cells from wild-type mice. Conversely, overexpression of GX sPLA2 in OP9 pre-adipocytes results in a significant 50% reduction in triglyceride accumulation during differentiation into mature adipocytes, an effect that was associated with significantly reduced induction of adipogenic genes, including Pparγ, Srebf1, Scd1, and Fasn. Activation of the liver X receptor (LXR), a nuclear receptor known to up-regulate adipogenic gene expression, was suppressed in OP9 cells when GX sPLA2 was overexpressed, leading us to conclude that GX sPLA2 negatively regulates adipogenesis, possibly by suppressing LXR activation. We also determined that GX sPLA2 suppresses LXR activation in macrophages, resulting in reduced expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1) (10.Shridas P. Bailey W.M. Gizard F. Oslund R.C. Gelb M.H. Bruemmer D. Webb N.R. Group X secretory phospholipase A2 negatively regulates ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression and cholesterol efflux in macrophages.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 2014-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consequently, macrophages from GX KO mice exhibit increased cellular cholesterol efflux and decreased cellular cholesterol content (10.Shridas P. Bailey W.M. Gizard F. Oslund R.C. Gelb M.H. Bruemmer D. Webb N.R. Group X secretory phospholipase A2 negatively regulates ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression and cholesterol efflux in macrophages.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 2014-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GX sPLA2 is expressed in adrenal cells, where it suppresses corticosteroid production through a mechanism that also appears to involve LXR. Compared with wild-type mice, GX KO mice have significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels under both basal and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-induced conditions. The expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), the rate-limiting protein in corticosteroid production, is significantly increased in adrenal glands from GX KO mice compared with wild-type adrenal glands. Conversely, in the mouse adrenal Y1 cell line, overexpression of GX sPLA2 suppresses StAR expression. Results from luciferase reporter assays indicated that GX sPLA2 antagonizes StAR promoter activity and LXR-mediated StAR promoter activation in adrenal cells. In summary, results from gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in multiple tissues indicate that GX sPLA2 modulates cellular metabolism by negatively regulating LXR target gene expression through a mechanism that is dependent on GX sPLA2 hydrolytic activity. Given the potent ability of GX sPLA2 to hydrolyze cell membranes and generate bioactive lipid mediators, its hydrolytic activity is likely under tight regulation. GX sPLA2 is one of only three sPLA2s produced as an inactive pro-enzyme, such that cleavage of an N-terminal pro-segment is necessary for its enzymatic activity (3.Morioka Y. Saiga A. Yokota Y. Suzuki N. Ikeda M. Ono T. Nakano K. Fujii N. Ishizaki J. Arita H. Hanasaki K. Mouse group X secretory phospholipase A2 induces a potent release of arachidonic acid from spleen cells and acts as a ligand for the phospholipase A2 receptor.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 381: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Studies in transgenic mice with constitutive GX sPLA2 expression indicate that the inactive precursor is the predominant form expressed in most tissues under normal conditions (11.Ohtsuki M. Taketomi Y. Arata S. Masuda S. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Takanezawa Y. Aoki J. Arai H. Yamamoto K. Kudo I. Murakami M. Transgenic expression of group V, but not group X, secreted phospholipase A2 in mice leads to neonatal lethality because of lung dysfunction.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36420-36433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, enzymatically active GX sPLA2 is detected in the transgenic mice in tissues with inflammatory granulation, suggesting that proteolytic activation may occur during inflammation. The N-terminal pro-segment of GX sPLA2 includes 11 amino acids ending in a dibasic motif, suggesting cleavage by member(s) of the furin-like proprotein convertase (PC) family. Recently, Jemel et al. (12.Jemel I. Ii H. Oslund R.C. Payré C. Dabert-Gay A.S. Douguet D. Chargui K. Scarzello S. Gelb M.H. Lambeau G. Group X secreted phospholipase A2 pro-enzyme is matured by a furin-like proprotein convertase and releases arachidonic acid inside of human HEK 293 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36509-36521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) showed that in transfected HEK 293 cells, the second residue within the dibasic doublet is necessary and sufficient for GX sPLA2 processing and hydrolytic activity. Furthermore, using a panel of nonspecific protease inhibitors, the involvement of PCs in GX sPLA2 maturation and activation in transfected 293 cells was confirmed. However, the identity of the individual PCs involved in GX sPLA2 processing in physiologically relevant tissues remains to be investigated. During the course of studying GX sPLA2 in adrenal cells, we noted significantly increased phospholipase activity secreted by Y1 cells stably transfected with a GX sPLA2 expression construct and, to a lesser extent, control-transfected Y1 cells, in response to ACTH treatment (13.Shridas P. Bailey W.M. Boyanovsky B.B. Oslund R.C. Gelb M.H. Webb N.R. Group X secretory phospholipase A2 regulates the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) in mouse adrenal glands.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20031-20039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We reasoned that this increase in secretion reflected post-transcriptional regulation of GX sPLA2, because the promoter driving recombinant GX sPLA2 expression in our cell system would not be expected to be regulated by ACTH. Thus, mouse Y1 cells provide us a physiologically relevant model for understanding GX sPLA2 regulation. In this study, we establish that an epitope-tagged form of pro-GX sPLA2 is proteolytically activated in Y1 adrenal cells by furin and PCSK6, two members of the PC family. We also provide evidence that PC-dependent proteolytic activation of pro-GX sPLA2 is enhanced under ACTH-stimulated conditions, suggesting a novel mechanism for regulating adrenal steroidogenesis. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was purchased from Sigma. The quantification of progesterone levels in cell media was achieved using a progesterone EIA kit (Cayman Chemical); sPLA2 activity was measured using our previously published method with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylglycerol (Matreya) as substrate (14.Wooton-Kee C.R. Boyanovsky B.B. Nasser M.S. de Villiers W.J. Webb N.R. Group V sPLA2 hydrolysis of low-density lipoprotein results in spontaneous particle aggregation and promotes macrophage foam cell formation.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or a commercially available sPLA2 assay kit (Cayman Chemical). Murine Y1 adrenal cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in F-12K media (ATCC) supplemented with 2.5% nonheat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 15% nonheat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. A C-terminal 3× FLAG-tagged mouse GX sPLA2 cDNA was developed by PCR using forward (5′-CTGAAGCTTATGCTGCTGCTACTG-3′) and reverse (5′-ATGAATTCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGATATCGTGGTCCTTGTAGTCTCCATCGTGGTCCTTGTAGTAGTCATT-3′) primers containing HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively, and a previously generated pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen) expression construct encoding GX sPLA2 fused to a single C-terminal FLAG tag as template (13.Shridas P. Bailey W.M. Boyanovsky B.B. Oslund R.C. Gelb M.H. Webb N.R. Group X secretory phospholipase A2 regulates the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) in mouse adrenal glands.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20031-20039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the amplified fragment containing the GX sPLA2 cDNA did not include any 5′- or 3′-noncoding sequences derived from the GX sPLA2 gene. Y1 cells were cultured on 100-mm dishes and transfected with either 3× FLAG-tagged GX sPLA2 or the corresponding pcDNA3.0 using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. G418 was then used to select for stable transfectants. A set of ON-TARGET plus SMART pool siRNA synthetic oligonucleotides directed toward the mouse PCSK6 target sequences (5′-UAAACAAGCUUUCGAGUAU-3′, 5′-GGUCAGAGAUGAACGUCCA-3′, 5′-CGAGAUGCCUGGCGUCACA-3′, and 5′-GAUGAGACCUUCUGCGCGA-3′) and toward the mouse furin target sequences (5′-CGACAUCGGCAAACGGCUA-3′, 5′-GAAGAAUCAUCCCGACCUA-3′, 5′-GAAAGUGAGCCAUUCGUAU-3′, and 5′-GCGCCACACAGUUCGGCAA-3′) were purchased from Thermo Scientific. The ON-TARGET plus nontargeting pool was used as a control. Cells were transfected with siRNAs using Dharmafect 1 transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated from mouse Y1 adrenal cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). cDNA was diluted 4-fold at which point quantitative PCR was performed with Power SYBR Green PCR master mix kit (Applied Biosystems) and the iQ5 multicolor RT-PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) through 40 cycles of amplification. Primer sequences used in qRT-PCR are available upon request. Proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE. The 3× FLAG-tagged GX sPLA2 chimeric protein was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 primary antibody (Stratagene). StAR was detected using anti-StAR primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary HRP-conjugated antibody was from Abcam. HEK 293 cells were grown to ∼75% confluence and then transfected with mouse 3× FLAG-tagged GX sPLA2 expression vector or a control vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) (0.4 μg), along with pTK-3-LXRE-Luc reporter construct (0.4 μg), mouse liver X receptor (mLXRα) (0.1 μg), mouse retinoid X receptor (mRXR) (0.1 μg), Renilla luciferase (Promega, 0.02 μg), and either furin, PCSK6 (Origene), or GFP expression constructs (0.4 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mLXR and mRXR expression constructs and the 3× LXR element reporter plasmid were gifts from Dr. Peter Tontonoz, UCLA. After 18 h, cells were incubated in fresh media (high glucose DMEM (HyClone), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), and either 0 or 1 μm T0901317 for 24 h. Cells were washed with DPBS and harvested in 1× PLB buffer (Promega). Luminescence was measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Statistical significance is reported in the figures and/or figure legends. Statistical analysis of data sets was performed using GraphPad Prism. For experiments in which only two groups were compared, a two-tailed Student's t test was performed. For comparison of means between more than two groups, a one- or two-way analysis of variance was used where appropriate. Post hoc analysis was done using Bonferroni's test. All data sets conformed to the constraints of the parametric analysis. To investigate post-translational mechanisms involved in regulating GX sPLA2 activity in adrenal cells, we generated mouse Y1 cells stably expressing GX sPLA2 fused to a C-terminal 3× FLAG sequence (Y1-GX) under the control of a CMV-driven promoter. This chimeric construct provided us with a model for studying the post-translational processing of GX sPLA2 based on differences in the molecular mass of the inactive precursor, pro-GX (∼15.2 kDa) and the mature form of the enzyme, m-GX (∼13.9 kDa). Phospholipase activity secreted by Y1-GX cells was increased ∼1.5-fold compared with Y1-C cells (Fig. 1A) indicating that GX sPLA2 expression was only modestly increased over endogenous levels in Y1-GX cells. In accordance with our previous findings (13.Shridas P. Bailey W.M. Boyanovsky B.B. Oslund R.C. Gelb M.H. Webb N.R. Group X secretory phospholipase A2 regulates the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) in mouse adrenal glands.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20031-20039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), ACTH treatment resulted in a significant increase in the phospholipase activity secreted by control-transfected Y1 cells (Y1-C) (Fig. 1A). The increase in phospholipase activity in response to ACTH was even more robust in Y1-GX cells (Fig. 1A). Associated with the increase in phospholipase activity in ACTH-treated Y1-GX cells was an increase in FLAG-pro-GX sPLA2 processing, expressed as the ratio of m-GX/total-GX sPLA2, in response to ACTH stimulation (Fig. 1B). In the case of untreated Y1-GX cells, ∼44% of total FLAG-GX sPLA2 present in the media was processed to the mature form. This contrasts to ACTH-treated cells, where ∼61% of secreted FLAG-GX sPLA2 had undergone proteolytic processing. m-GX sPLA2 was not detected in cell lysates of Y1-GX cells in either the absence or presence of ACTH (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results suggest that ACTH enhances the phospholipase activity secreted by Y1-GX cells, at least partly by increasing the proteolytic processing of pro-GX sPLA2, and that pro-GX sPLA2 is the major, if not exclusive, form detected intracellularly. Based on results from studies using a panel of protease inhibitors, the family of furin-like PCs has recently been implicated in the proteolytic activation of GX sPLA2 in transfected HEK 293 cells (12.Jemel I. Ii H. Oslund R.C. Payré C. Dabert-Gay A.S. Douguet D. Chargui K. Scarzello S. Gelb M.H. Lambeau G. Group X secreted phospholipase A2 pro-enzyme is matured by a furin-like proprotein convertase and releases arachidonic acid inside of human HEK 293 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36509-36521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PCs in regulating GX sPLA2 proteolytic activation in mouse Y1 adrenal cells, sPLA2 activity and FLAG-pro-GX sPLA2 processing was assessed in Y1-GX cells treated with the PC inhibitor, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone. After overnight incubation, both the precursor and mature forms of FLAG-GX sPLA2 were detected in the media of vehicle-treated Y1-GX cells, and ACTH treatment significantly increased the ratio of m-GX sPLA2/total-GX sPLA2 (Fig. 2A). However, the processing of FLAG-pro-GX-sPLA2 was almost completely abolished in RVKR-treated cells, both in the absence and presence of ACTH. This decrease in processing was accompanied by a significant reduction in sPLA2 activity secreted by the cells (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate a role for furin-like PCs in the proteolytic activation of GX sPLA2 in Y1 adrenal cells under both basal and ACTH-stimulated conditions. To identify candidate PCs that may be responsible for regulating GX sPLA2 activity in adrenal cells, we quantified mRNA abundance for each member of the PC family in Y1 cells under basal and ACTH-stimulated conditions. Among the six candidate convertases, only four were expressed at appreciable levels (Ct value <35) as follows: furin, PCSK5, PCSK6, and PCSK7 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, both furin and PCSK6 mRNA abundance were significantly increased in response to overnight incubation with ACTH, consistent with the enhanced pro-GX sPLA2 processing. Therefore, we further investigated the role of furin and PCSK6 in regulating GX sPLA2 processing in Y1 cells. Previous reports characterizing the substrate specificity of PCs suggest some redundancy in functionality for some, but not all, targets (15.Artenstein A.W. Opal S.M. Proprotein convertases in health and disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365: 2507-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To assess whether pro-GX sPLA2 is a substrate for furin and/or PCSK6 proteolytic activation, FLAG-pro-GX sPLA2 was co-expressed with either furin or PCSK6 in HEK 293 cells. The ratio of m-GX sPLA2/total-GX sPLA2 in media from HEK 293 cells expressing GX sPLA2 alone was ∼1:1 (Fig. 4A). Expression of either furin or PCSK6 resulted in an almost complete conversion of FLAG-pro-GX sPLA2 to the mature form, indicating that pro-GX sPLA2 is a substrate for both PCs. m-GX sPLA2 was not detected in whole-cell lysates, indicating that the active form of the enzyme does not accumulate intracellularly after pro-GX sPLA2 is processed by furin or PCSK6 (Fig. 4B). To determine whether furin and/or PCSK6 mediate GX sPLA2 proteolytic activation in adrenal cells, we employed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to suppress the expression of furin mRNA, PCSK6 mRNA, or both mRNAs. Both furin and PCSK6 mRNA expression was effectively reduced ∼75% using this approach (Fig. 5, A and B). Neither knockdown of furin nor PCSK6 alone was able to significantly inhibit processing of FLAG-pro-GX sPLA2 secreted by Y1 cells (Fig. 5C). However, knockdown of both furin and PCSK6 together resulted in a significant reduction in FLAG-pro-GX sPLA2 cleavage. As expected, ACTH treatment significantly increased the ratio of m-GX sPLA2/total-GX sPLA2 in the media compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 5D). However, enhanced FLAG-pro-GX sPLA2 processing in response to ACTH was significantly decreased when furin and PCSK6 expression was suppressed. These findings strongly suggest that both furin and PCSK6 mediate GX sPLA2 processing in Y1 adrenal cells, and ACTH-induced increases in GX sPLA2 activity is at least partly due to up-regulation of these convertases. We previously reported that GX sPLA2 inhibits LXR-mediated target gene activation through a mechanism that is dependent on its enzymatic activity (10.Shridas P. Bailey W.M. Gizard F. Oslund R.C. Gelb M.H. Bruemmer D. Webb N.R. Group X secretory phospholipase A2 negatively regulates ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression and cholesterol efflux in macrophages.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 2014-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether proteolytic activation of GX sPLA2 by furin or PCSK6 enhances GX sPLA2-dependent inhibition of LXR activation. As expected, GX sPLA2 overexpression in HEK 293 cells suppressed the transcriptional activation of an LXR reporter construct under both basal and T0901317-treated conditions (Fig. 6, A and B). The inhibitory effect of GX sPLA2 on LXR activation was augmented when either furin or PCSK6 was co-expressed, indicating that GX sPLA2 processing by furin-like proprotein convertases may represent an important mechanism for regulating GX sPLA2-mediated inhibition of LXR transcriptional activation. StAR plays a critical function in adrenal corticoid synthesis by delivering cholesterol to steroidogenic enzymes located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Given its key role in corticosteroid production, StAR mRNA expression is under both positive and negative control by a variety of transcription factors, including LXR (16.Cummins C.L. Volle D.H. Zhang Y. McDonald J.G. Sion B. Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Caira F. Veyssière G. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lobaccaro J.M. Liver X receptors regulate adrenal cholesterol balance.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1902-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Given our previous finding that GX sPLA2 suppresses StAR expression in an LXR-dependent manner (13.Shridas P. Bailey W.M. Boyanovsky B.B. Oslund R.C. Gelb M.H. Webb N.R. Group X secretory phospholipase A2 regulates the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) in mouse adrenal glands.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20031-20039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it was of interest to investigate whether inhibiting PC activity impacted the ability of GX sPLA2 to regulate StAR, and hence steroid production in adrenal cells. As we reported previously, GX sPLA2 overexpression inhibited StAR protein expression in Y1 cells under both basal (Fig. 7A) and ACTH-stimulated conditions (Fig. 7B). This inhibitory effect was abolished when cells were treated with RVKR. In a subsequent study, we de"

Consistent with this observation, in humans, loss of function mutations in the ABCB6 gene results in a variety of complex human diseases whose pathogenesis is independent of porphyrin synthesis (19.Cui Y.X.

Here we show that Abcb6 deficiency suppresses CYP450 expression in mice and human hepatocytes. We report that ablation of Abcb6 reprograms hepatic metabolite profile that negatively regulates hepatic CYP expression, probably as a homeostatic response to promote survival. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise. Abcb6 knock-out mice were generated on C57BL6/N background using ES cells developed by the trans-NIH Knock-Out Mouse Project. The ablation cassette (velocigene cassette [bacterial β-galactosidase-polyadenylation signal-loxP (locus of X over P1) site-human ubiquitin C gene promoter-neomycin phosphotransferase-polyadenylation signal-loxP site]) used to generate Abcb6 knock-out mice replaces the Abcb6 ORF containing exons 3–5 with the β-galactosidase-hUBC/em7-neomycin-poly(A) cassette, where the neomycin expression cassette is flanked by loxP sites (24.Skarnes W.C. Rosen B. West A.P. Koutsourakis M. Bushell W. Iyer V. Mujica A.O. Thomas M. Harrow J. Cox T. Jackson D. Severin J. Biggs P. Fu J. Nefedov M. de Jong P.J. Stewart A.F. Bradley A. A conditional knockout resource for the genome-wide study of mouse gene function.Nature. 2011; 474: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Microinjection of ES cells and generation of Abcb6 heterozygous mice were done according to standard procedures. Mice were genotyped using appropriate primers. The first primer pair anchors to exon 1 (WT-F; see Fig. 1a) and exon 3 (WT-R; see Fig. 1a) and amplifies 470 bp of the WT allele. The sequences of the primers are as follows: WT-F, 5′-GCCCCCAGTCTTATACTCTACACG-3′, and WT-R, 5′-CCCATGCCTCTCTCTGCTTTCC-3′. The second primer pair anchors to exon 1 (KO-F; see Fig. 1a) and the neomycin cassette (KO-R; see Fig. 1a) and amplifies 620 bp of the mutant allele. The primer sequences are as follows: KO-F, 5′-CACACCTCCCCCTGAACCTGAAA-3′, and KO-R, 5′-CGTGACCCCTCTCAGAGTTAGGAAAG-3′). All animal experiments were approved by the University of Kansas Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were housed in polycarbonate cages (four per cage), provided normal diet and water ad libitum, and maintained on a 12-h/12-h light-dark cycle at 22 ± 5 °C and 50 ± 20% relative humidity. All Abcb6 knock-out mice used in these studies were mice that escaped stunted growth (those that appear normal in Fig. 1h). The reason for this is because most of these small/stunted mice do not survive beyond 5–6 weeks after weaning. Human liver-derived cell lines Hep3B and Huh7 were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Hep3B and Huh7 cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Knockdown of endogenous ABCB6 expression in Hep3B and Huh7 cells were achieved, as previously described (21.Polireddy K. Chavan H. Abdulkarim B.A. Krishnamurthy P. Functional significance of the ATP-binding cassette transporter B6 in hepatocellular carcinoma.Mol. Oncol. 2011; 5: 410-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), using ABCB6-specific shRNA lentiviral particles. ABCB6-shRNA viral particles were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Stable cell lines harboring either ABCB6-shRNA or the scrambled shRNA were cultured in selection medium containing 0.6 μg/ml puromycin. ABCB6 knockdown in these cell lines was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis using gene-specific primers and protein-specific antibodies (21.Polireddy K. Chavan H.

Immunoreactive proteins were detected using polyclonal goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase IgG secondary antibodies (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and visualized using SupersignalTM chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Thermo Scientific). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ analysis software (National Institutes of Health). RNA isolation from liver tissue was done using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). 1 μg of RNA was used for reverse complementation using iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit, following the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). Real time PCR was performed using the CFX384TM real time PCR system (Bio-Rad), as described previously by using primer sets specific for the mouse genes (29.Chavan H. Krishnamurthy P.

Briefly, the incubation reaction consisted of 3 μm midazolam, 5 μm chlorozoxazone, 50 μm bupropion, or 30 μm melatonin with 0.03 mg of mouse liver microsomes, in a final volume of 200 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Following 5 min of preincubation at 37 °C, the reaction was initiated by adding NADPH (final concentration, 1.0 mm) and incubated for an additional 10 min for midazolam, 15 min for chlorozoxazone, 15 min for melatonin, and 20 min for bupropion, with shaking at 37 °C. Incubations were terminated by adding 200 μl of ice-cold acetonitrile, and the incubation reaction was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants from the centrifugation were transferred to an auto sampler vial, and 5 μl was injected into the ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS; SYNAPT-G1 Waters, Milford, MA) 3The abbreviations used are: UPLC-QTOFMSultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometryTCPOBOP1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzenePXRpregnane x receptor. system for metabolite analysis. ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene pregnane x receptor. Heme measurement was done using liver tissue from Abcb6+/+, Abcb6+/−, and Abcb6−/− mice as described (26.Lynch J. Fukuda Y. Krishnamurthy P. Du G. Schuetz J.D. Cell survival under stress is enhanced by a mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter that regulates hemoproteins.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 5560-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 mg of liver tissue was homogenized in 100 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Heme extraction was performed using 2× volumes of ethyl acetate and acetic acid mixture (4:1). The sample was vortexed briefly and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min. Each supernatant was diluted 5× with 50% acetonitrile and transferred to an auto sampler vial, of which 5 μl was injected into the UPLC-QTOFMS system for heme analysis. UPLC-QTOFMS analyses were performed as described previously (31.Li F. Lu J. Ma X. Profiling the reactive metabolites of xenobiotics using metabolomic technologies.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2011; 24: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 100 mm × 2.1 mm (Acquity 1.7 μm) UPLC BEH C-18 column (Waters) was used to separate metabolites. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.3 ml·min−1, with a gradient ranging from 2 to 98% aqueous acetonitrile, containing 0.1% formic acid in a 10-min run. QTOFMS was operated in a positive mode with electrospray ionization. The source temperature and desolvation temperature were set at 120 and 350 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was applied as the cone gas (10 liter·h−1) and desolvation gas (700 liter·h−1), and argon as the collision gas. QTOFMS was calibrated with sodium formate and monitored by the intermittent injection of lock mass leucine enkephalin, in real time, generating a reference ion at m/z 556.2771. The capillary voltage and cone voltage were set at 3.5 kV and 35 V in positive ion mode. Mass chromatograms and mass spectra were acquired by MassLynx software (Waters) in centroid format from m/z 50 to 1000. Identification of major metabolites was performed using MakerLynx software (Waters), based on accurate mass measurement (mass errors less than 10 ppm). All incubations were performed in duplicate. Pentobarbital-induced sedation of Abcb6+/+ and Abcb6−/− mice was determined, after animals were injected with a single intraperitoneal dose of sodium pentobarbital (40 mg·kg−1 body weight) in corn oil. Sleep latency was determined by measuring the duration of time it took for the animals to completely lose their righting reflex, following pentobarbital injection. Sedation was determined by measuring the duration of sleep time, defined as the period from the moment of complete loss of righting reflex to the time the animals regained their reflexes. Zoxazolamine-induced paralysis of Abcb6+/+ and Abcb6−/− mice was determined after animals were injected with a single intraperitoneal dose of zoxazolamine (300 mg·kg−1) in corn oil. Mice were then placed on their backs. Paralysis time was determined by measuring the duration of inactivity, defined as the period of time from the moment of complete loss of reflex to the time the animals regained enough consciousness to right themselves. In experiments where TCPOBOP was used to induce Cyp2b10 expression, mice were given a single intraperitoneal dose of TCPOBOP (3 mg·kg−1) in corn oil or corn oil alone. All animals received intraperitoneal zoxazolamine (425 mg·kg−1) in corn oil 24 h following TCPOBOP treatment. Paralysis time was measured as described above. All hemin solutions were freshly prepared as described (32.Wagener F.A. Eggert A. Boerman O.C. Oyen W.J. Verhofstad A. Abraham N.G. Adema G. van Kooyk Y. de Witte T. Figdor C.G. Heme is a potent inducer of inflammation in mice and is counteracted by heme oxygenase.Blood. 2001; 98: 1802-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Briefly, hemin (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved together with Trizma base in 0.1 m NaOH solution and diluted in saline. Next, pH 11–12 of the hemin solution was adjusted to pH 8 with HCl. The solution was then filter sterilized, protected from light, and directly used. The dose and frequency of hemin administration to mice, were based on previous reports (33.Jover R. Hoffmann F. Scheffler-Koch V. Lindberg R.L. Limited heme synthesis in porphobilinogen deaminase-deficient mice impairs transcriptional activation of specific cytochrome P450 genes by phenobarbital.Eur. J.

The main study included three mice per group (Abcb6+/+ and Abcb6−/−) per experiment, which were treated with either vehicle alone or hemin (1.25, 2.5, or 5 mg·kg−1), administered intraperitoneally once every 12 h for 3 days. At the end of treatment, mice were sacrificed, and livers were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen, for subsequent biochemical analysis and RNA preparation. Promoter-reporter luciferase activity assays were performed as previously described (29.Chavan H. Krishnamurthy P.

All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine reagent following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). All transfections also included Renilla luciferase (100 ng/well) as an internal transfection control. Following overnight transfection, the transfected cells were treated with either (a) rifampicin (5 μm), (b) TCPOBOP (500 nm), or (c) 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC; 10 μm) and the indicated amount of either Abcb6+/+ or Abcb6−/− liver extract. The relative activity of the promoter constructs was determined, after subtraction of the values obtained for the corresponding luciferase control vectors, and the results were expressed in relative terms. All experiments were performed at least three times, with a minimum of four replicates per experiment. Metabolite extraction from liver samples was done as described (36.Gaikwad N.W. Ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for profiling of steroid metabolome in human tissue.Anal. Chem. 2013; 85: 4951-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 mg of liver tissue was ground and suspended in 4 ml of a 1:1 water/methanol mixture. The homogenate was cooled on ice, and precipitated material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min.

In these studies, HepG2 cells grown to subconfluence were treated with actinomycin D (Sigma), at a final concentration of 2.5 μm, to arrest de novo RNA synthesis. To determine the half-life of P450 transcript, actinomycin D-treated cells were harvested at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 20, and 24 h, and P450 mRNA was quantified by RT-PCR as described above.

https://openalex.org/W1963513125,"TBX5 is the gene mutated in Holt-Oram syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder with complex heart and limb deformities. Its protein product is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors and an evolutionarily conserved dosage-sensitive regulator of heart and limb development. Understanding TBX5 regulation is therefore of paramount importance. Here we uncover the existence of novel exons and provide evidence that TBX5 activity may be extensively regulated through alternative splicing to produce protein isoforms with differing N- and C-terminal domains. These isoforms are also present in human heart, indicative of an evolutionarily conserved regulatory mechanism. The newly identified isoforms have different transcriptional properties and can antagonize TBX5a target gene activation. Droplet Digital PCR as well as immunohistochemistry with isoform-specific antibodies reveal differential as well as overlapping expression domains. In particular, we find that the predominant isoform in skeletal myoblasts is Tbx5c, and we show that it is dramatically up-regulated in differentiating myotubes and is essential for myotube formation. Mechanistically, TBX5c antagonizes TBX5a activation of pro-proliferative signals such as IGF-1, FGF-10, and BMP4. The results provide new insight into Tbx5 regulation and function that will further our understanding of its role in health and disease. The finding of new exons in the Tbx5 locus may also be relevant to mutational screening especially in the 30% of Holt-Oram syndrome patients with no mutations in the known TBX5a exons.

Genetic linkage analyses have mapped the disease to the chromosomal locus where TBX5 is located, and mutations in TBX5 have been found in patients with HOS. Moreover, Tbx5 expression pattern in the upper limb, atria, and left ventricle along with mouse genetics studies have strengthened the causative link between TBX5 and HOS (3Bruneau B.G. Nemer G.

Over 70 mutations in the TBX5 locus have been identified so far in HOS patients (4Heinritz W. Shou L. Moschik A. Froster U.G. The human TBX5 gene mutation database.Hum. Mutat. 2005; 26: 397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Many result in no protein production or in truncated proteins. Other more subtle mutations generate functionally impaired proteins with altered subcellular localization, DNA binding, transcriptional activity, and/or interaction with cofactors (5Fan C. Liu M.

These findings led to the suggestion that haploinsufficiency may be the mechanism of pathogenesis, but this remains uncertain in many cases. Interestingly, in about 30–35% of HOS patients, no mutations in TBX5 coding sequences or intron-exon junctions are detected (8Borozdin W. Bravo Ferrer Acosta A.M. Bamshad M.J. Botzenhart E.M.

Mutat. 2006; 27: 975-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which has raised the controversial suggestion of the existence of another as yet unidentified HOS-causing locus. An alternative explanation could be that unscreened mutations within presumed untranscribed regions of TBX5 account for this low detection rate. Consistent with this, we recently reported the existence of a new exon downstream of the T-box whose alternative splicing results in a TBX5 isoform lacking the entire C terminus, which contains several functional domains (9Georges R. Nemer G. Morin M. Lefebvre C. Nemer M. Distinct expression and function of alternatively spliced Tbx5 isoforms in cell growth and differentiation.Mol. Cell.

TBX5 is a member of the large family of T-box transcription factors critical for early cellular commitment, differentiation, and organ development (10Hariri F. Nemer M. Nemer G. T-box factors: insights into the evolutionary emergence of the complex heart.Ann. Med. 2012; 44: 680-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). T-box (or Tbx) proteins bind specific DNA motifs, called TBEs (T-box binding elements), to activate or repress target promoters. TBX5 appears to act essentially as a transcriptional activator and cooperates with other transcription factors such as GATA4 and NKX2.5 to synergistically regulate downstream targets (3Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A. Gessler M. Nemer M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G.

As such, TBX5 activity can be modulated at the DNA binding level and through protein-protein interactions. In addition to transcriptional regulators, TBX5 was shown to interact with the cytoskeleton-associated LIM protein LMP4, which represses its transcriptional activity, possibly by stimulating its cytoplasmic redistribution (12Camarata T. Bimber B. Kulisz A. Chew T.L. Yeung J. Simon H.G. LMP4 regulates Tbx5 protein subcellular localization and activity.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). TBX51–518 (referred to thereafter as TBX5a) resides largely if not exclusively in the nucleus, and two nuclear localization signals have been identified, one within the T-box DNA binding domain and another between amino acids (AA) 325 and 340 outside the T-box (13Zaragoza M.V. Lewis L.E. Sun G. Wang E. Li L. Said-Salman I. Feucht L. Huang T. Identification of the TBX5 transactivating domain and the nuclear localization signal.Gene. 2004; 330: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A putative nuclear export signal within the T-box has also been suggested to mediate Crml-dependent nuclear export of TBX5 (14Kulisz A. Simon H.G. An evolutionarily conserved nuclear export signal facilitates cytoplasmic localization of the Tbx5 transcription factor.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1553-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but this has been challenged based on the crystal structure of the T-box domain of TBX5 in DNA-bound and unbound forms (15Stirnimann C.U. Ptchelkine D. Grimm C. Müller C.W. Structural basis of TBX5-DNA recognition: the T-box domain in its DNA-bound and -unbound form.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 400: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The crystal structure also identified the T-box residues that contact DNA as those toward the C terminus of the T-box. Interactions between TBX5 and other transcriptional regulators also require the T-box (3Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A. Gessler M. Nemer M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G.

Biol. 2008; 28: 4052-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition to DNA binding, transcriptional activation by TBX5 depends on sequences outside the T-box. Deletion analysis showed that removal of the N-terminal 50 AA decreases TBX5 transcriptional activity, albeit not as severely as removal of the C-terminal 100 AA. Another domain that contributes to transcriptional activation was localized between AA 255 and 316 just C-terminal of the T-box. Interestingly, the three domains are differentially required for physical and functional interaction with GATA4 and NKX2.5 (9Georges R. Nemer G. Morin M. Lefebvre C. Nemer M. Distinct expression and function of alternatively spliced Tbx5 isoforms in cell growth and differentiation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4052-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Gal4-TBX5 chimera confirmed the presence of a potent transcriptional activation domain (TAD) in the last 250 AA of TBX5a (16Plageman Jr., T.F. Yutzey K.E. Differential expression and function of Tbx5 and Tbx20 in cardiac development.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19026-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); an autonomous TAD was also mapped between AA 339 and 379 (13Zaragoza M.V. Lewis L.E. Sun G. Wang E. Li L. Said-Salman I. Feucht L. Huang T. Identification of the TBX5 transactivating domain and the nuclear localization signal.Gene. 2004; 330: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the present work, we report the existence of new Tbx5 exons and additional alternatively spliced TBX5 isoforms that differ from TBX5 in the N- or C-terminal domains. We show that the new isoforms are expressed in distinct domains that sometimes overlap with Tbx5a. We show that one of the novel isoforms plays a unique role in skeletal muscle differentiation where it suppresses proliferation signals and induces differentiation. The results provide important information on the Tbx5 locus and novel insight into Tbx5 regulation and function. Tbx5 transcripts with variable 3′ ends (Tbx5c and Tbx5d) were obtained using nested cDNA amplification of mRNA from embryonic hearts and limbs. cDNAs were amplified by RT-PCR using a 5′ oligonucleotide spanning the first codons of the T-box and at the 3′ end, an oligo(dT). The resulting products were cloned into the Bluescript plasmid, and individual clones were sequenced. Full-length clones containing the N-terminal sequences were then amplified using specific primers and subcloned in the pcDNA3 expression vector in phase with Kozak triple FLAG epitope. To isolate isoforms with variable 5′ end (Tbx5e), primer extension amplification was used with the primer sequence overlapping the 5′ end of the T-box sequences. Oligonucleotides used were: 5′-GGAGGTACCGCCGATACAGATGAGGGCTTTG-3′ (forward for Tbx5a, Tbx5c, Tbx5d, and Tbx5b); 5′-GCAGGTACCGAAGGAATCAAGGTGTTTCTTCATG-3′ (forward for Tbx5e); 5′-CCGGAATTCTTAGCTATTCTCACTCCACTCTGG-3′ (reverse for Tbx5a and Tbx5e); 5′-GCACTCGAGCTAATGAAAGGATGGTGAGAGAG-3′ (reverse for Tbx5c); 5′-CGCGAATTCCTATATTTCTGTGCCACTTACTT-3′ (reverse for Tbx5d); and 5′-CCCCTCGAGCTAAAGCAGAGGCCTTTGCATCCGAG-3′ (reverse for Tbx5b).

Nuclear extracts were prepared from 293T cells. Binding reactions were done at room temperature using 1 μg of poly(dI-dC).

Endogenous TBX5 proteins were analyzed in two relevant mouse lines, the TC13 cardiogenic cell line and in C2C12 myoblasts, as well as in 30-day-old mouse hearts. Protein extraction and analysis were as reported in Georges et al. (9Georges R. Nemer G. Morin M. Lefebvre C. Nemer M.

The N-terminal TBX5a antibody was previously described. The C-terminal TBX5a antibody as well as TBX5c and TBX5d antibodies were similarly raised in rabbits against the unique C-terminal domains: AA 331–425 for TBX5a, AA 327–404 for TBX5c, and AA 327–376 for TBX5d. Immunocytochemistry was done on 293T cells overexpressing the relevant FLAG-TBX5 constructs as described previously (9Georges R. Nemer G. Morin M. Lefebvre C. Nemer M.

Mouse anti-FLAG M2 was purchased from Sigma (F1804). Immunofluorescence was performed on C2C12 cells overexpressing the indicated HA-TBX5 constructs. Myosin heavy chain and myogenin antibodies were both obtained from mouse hybridoma cells (MF20 and F5D, respectively). HA antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC-805).

To analyze endogenous TBX5 protein, we developed a specific antibody against the N-terminal TBX5 region; in Western blots, this antibody detected, in addition to the expected TBX5a band, immunoreactive bands that co-migrated with a TBX5 protein truncated of the last 118 amino acids (9Georges R. Nemer G. Morin M. Lefebvre C. Nemer M. Distinct expression and function of alternatively spliced Tbx5 isoforms in cell growth and differentiation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4052-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine whether these bands represent novel TBX5 isoforms, we used a PCR amplification strategy to isolate Tbx5 cDNAs from mouse heart and limb RNA. A 5′ oligonucleotide primer spanning the first codons of the T-box and a 3′ oligo(dT) primer allowed amplification of Tbx5 transcripts containing the T-domain together with any variable 3′ sequences. Isolation and sequencing of several independent cDNA clones revealed the presence of four distinct transcripts that may result in four different TBX5 proteins; in addition to sequences corresponding to Tbx5a and the previously described short isoform (9Georges R. Nemer G. Morin M. Lefebvre C. Nemer M. Distinct expression and function of alternatively spliced Tbx5 isoforms in cell growth and differentiation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4052-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), two new sequences were identified that would encode novel TBX5 isoforms of 404 and 376 AA, termed Tbx5c and Tbx5d, respectively (Fig. 1A). These two isoforms result from the use of two alternative exons (exon 9a or exon 10), which are mutually exclusive with exon 11. Tbx5c is generated from the splicing of exon 9 to exon 10 instead of exon 11, whereas Tbx5d originates from the usage of an alternative exon 9, named exon 9a, which emanates from the retention of additional intronic sequences 3′ of exon 9 (Fig. 1C). The result in both cases is the addition, after position 327, of a 77-AA (TBX5c) or 49-AA (TBX5d) divergent region (Fig. 1, B and D). Once the additional exons were sequenced, we cloned the entire cDNA coding sequence of the novel isoforms from mouse embryonic atria (Tbx5d) and forelimb (Tbx5c) using primers spanning the first codon (ATG) and the stop codon of the different isoforms. Sequence analysis of the genomic TBX5 locus in existing databases (NCBI, Ensembl) revealed the possibility of a fifth TBX5 isoform, TBX5e (Fig. 1A). This isoform would result from the splicing of an alternative exon 1 in mice (termed exon 1b) with exon 3; thus, skipping exon 2 leading to an N-terminal truncation of 50 AA (Fig. 1, C and D). Exon 1b is highly homologous to the human exon 1. To confirm the in vivo existence of such Tbx5e transcripts, a primer overlapping exon 1b and 3 was used in RT-PCR amplification together with a reverse primer spanning the stop codon of exon 11; this resulted in the isolation of Tbx5e cDNA clones from mouse heart RNA. Thus a N-terminally truncated TBX5 isoform is present in both humans and rodents. Next, we analyzed the tissue distribution of Tbx5c and Tbx5d, which contain novel exons, using Droplet Digital PCR. In the case of Tbx5a and Tbx5d, a forward primer corresponding to sequences in the common exon 7 was used along with a reverse primer specific to exon 11 (Tbx5a) or exon 9a (Tbx5d). Forward and reverse primers were chosen in exon 10 in the case of Tbx5c. Using this strategy, we detected all isoforms in E11.5 atria and forelimbs. E11.5 ventricles expressed mostly Tbx5a and lower levels of the other isoforms. Tbx5a and Tbx5c transcripts were also detected in the hindlimbs, albeit at much lower levels (Fig. 2A). A similar expression pattern was seen in the postnatal heart where Tbx5a was always the predominant isoform (Fig. 2B). We also verified the presence of these isoforms in cardiogenic cell lines, notably the atrium-like HL-1 cells and the endocardial progenitors TC13 cells, as well as in skeletal muscle progenitors such as C2C12 myoblasts. The Tbx5 expression pattern in HL1 resembled that of the E11.5 heart with the predominance of Tbx5a (Fig. 2C). Tbx5a was the only isoform present in TC13 cells but not in C2C12 myoblasts where Tbx5c was the predominant isoform and was dramatically up-regulated after differentiation. We then used the N-terminal TBX5 antibody (9Georges R. Nemer G. Morin M. Lefebvre C. Nemer M. Distinct expression and function of alternatively spliced Tbx5 isoforms in cell growth and differentiation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4052-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to analyze the profile of TBX5 proteins in cardiac cells. Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from TC13 cells revealed the existence of multiple immunoreactive bands (Fig. 2D) co-migrating with TBX5a, TBX5b, TBX5c, and TBX5d; TBX5a and TBX5c were also detected in C2C12 cells (Fig. 2D) although the TBX5a band was much weaker. To verify the presence of TBX5e, a similar blot was incubated with an antibody raised against a C-terminal epitope encoded by exon 11 (AA 331–425); this antibody can detect TBX5a and TBX5e but not TBX5b, TBX5c, and TBX5d. Consistent with the Droplet Digital PCR results, a strong band co-migrating with TBX5a was detected in TC13 nuclear extracts as well as a weaker band co-migrating with TBX5e. A 50-kDa band that may be TBX5e was also present in C2C12 cells (Fig. 2E). Next, we analyzed TBX5 complexes in postnatal hearts. Nuclear extracts were obtained using 300 mm NaCl extraction and dialyzed to 100 mm salt, and chromatin-binding proteins were enriched on a phosphocellulose column; chromatin-bound proteins were eluted at 300 mm salt and size-fractionated under non-denaturing conditions using a gel filtration Superose 6 column. Western blots on the resulting fractions were carried out using the N-terminal TBX5 antibody. Bands corresponding to TBX5a (∼64–80 kDa) were evident in several high molecular mass fractions. An immunoreactive band around 48 kDa was also present and would correspond to TBX5d (Fig. 2F). These results confirm the presence in the heart of TBX5a and TBX5d and suggest the existence of different protein complexes containing distinct TBX5 isoforms in Tbx5-expressing organs. Next, we wanted to verify whether similar splice isoforms exist in humans. In silico analysis of the mouse and human TBX5 genomic sequences revealed the presence of similar alternate splice site junctions for Tbx5c and TBX5d. For Tbx5d, this predicted the existence of alternate splicing within exon 9 to produce the splice variant shown in Fig. 3A, which turned out to be identical to the reported transcribed sequence MN_181486, which would produce a 350-AA isoform whose last 22 AA are divergent from TBX5a (Fig. 3B). The presence of this cDNA sequence was also reported by Basson et al. (1Basson C.T. Bachinsky D.R. Lin R.C. Levi T. Elkins J.A. Soults J. Grayzel D. Kroumpouzou E. Traill T.A. Leblanc-Straceski J.

https://openalex.org/W2061038198,"Despite recent improvements in the survival rates for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), novel treatment strategies are required to improve distant metastasis-free survival. The sodium iodine symporter (NIS) gene has been applied for in vivo imaging and cancer therapy. In this study, we examined the potential of NIS gene therapy as a therapeutic approach in NPC by performing non-invasive imaging using 125I and 131I therapy in vivo.We constructed a lentiviral vector expressing NIS and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the human elongation factor-1α (EF1α) promoter, and stably transfected the vector into CNE-2Z NPC cells to create CNE-2Z-NIS cells. CNE-2Z and CNE-2Z-NIS tumor xenografts were established in nude mice; 125I uptake, accumulation and efflux were measured using micro-SPECT/CT imaging; the therapeutic effects of treatment with 131I were assessed over 25 days by measuring tumor volume and immunohistochemical staining of the excised tumors.qPCR, immunofluorescence and Western blotting confirmed that CNE-2Z-NIS cells expressed high levels of NIS mRNA and protein. CNE-2Z-NIS cells and xenografts took up and accumulated significantly more 125I than CNE-2Z cells and xenografts. In vitro, 131I significantly reduced the clonogenic survival of CNE-2Z-NIS cells. In vivo, 131I effectively inhibited the growth of CNE-2Z-NIS xenografts. At the end of 131I therapy, CNE-2Z-NIS xenograft tumor cells expressed higher levels of NIS and caspase-3 and lower levels of Ki-67.Lentiviruses effectively delivered and mediated long-lasting expression of NIS in CNE-2Z cells which enabled uptake and accumulation of radioisotopes and provided a significant therapeutic effect in an in vivo model of NPC. NIS-mediated radioiodine treatment merits further investigation as a potentially effective, low toxicity therapeutic strategy for NPC."

However, these measures only provide an estimate of improved reclassification at population level. We present a straightforward approach to characterize subgroups of reclassified individuals in order to tailor implementation of a new prediction model to individuals expected to benefit from it. Methods In a large Dutch population cohort (n = 21,992) we classified individuals to low (<5%) and high (≥5%) fatal cardiovascular disease risk by the Framingham risk score (FRS) and reclassified them based on the systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE). Subsequently, we characterized the reclassified individuals and, in case of heterogeneity, applied cluster analysis to identify and characterize subgroups. These characterizations were used to select individuals expected to benefit from implementation of SCORE. Results Reclassification after applying SCORE in all individuals resulted in an NRI of 5.00% (95% CI [-0.53%; 11.50%]) within the events, 0.06% (95% CI [-0.08%; 0.22%]) within the nonevents, and a total NRI of 0.051 (95% CI [-0.004; 0.116]). Among the correctly downward reclassified individuals cluster analysis identified three subgroups. Using the characterizations of the typically correctly reclassified individuals, implementing SCORE only in individuals expected to benefit (n = 2,707,12.3%) improved the NRI to 5.32% (95% CI [-0.13%; 12.06%]) within the events, 0.24% (95% CI [0.10%; 0.36%]) within the nonevents, and a total NRI of 0.055 (95% CI [0.001; 0.123]). Overall, the risk levels for individuals reclassified by tailored implementation of SCORE were more accurate. Discussion In our empirical example the presented approach successfully characterized subgroups of reclassified individuals that could be used to improve reclassification and reduce implementation burden. In particular when newly added biomarkers or imaging tests are costly or burdensome such a tailored implementation strategy may save resources and improve (cost-)effectiveness."

It was shown that they are destructed in the course of cystic fibrosis. We employed wide-field, micrometer resolution in vivo optical coherence tomography to assess the surface density of LSGs in 18 patients with CF and 18 healthy subjects. The median LSGs’ surface densities in CF patients, and in the control group were 4.32 glands/cm2 and 6.58 glands/cm2, respectively (p = 0.006; Mann-Whitney U test). A lower LSG surface density is a previously unrecognized CF-related pathology of the alimentary tract."
