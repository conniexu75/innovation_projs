On the other hand, in March 1951 at Millport it was difficult to find eggs in the oviduct of Calanus in which the chromosomes had reached further than the pachytene stage. This was in spite of the fact that a high proportion of the females brought into the laboratory at this date laid a batch of eggs overnight. It seemed as if few of these Calanus would be ready to lay before night. In order to find at what time the actual spawning takes place at Millport, 104 ripe female Calanus were put singly into small glass dishes containing about 20 ml. of filtered sea water and examined hourly. The Calanus were caught between 50 and 100 metres at 4 p.m. and examination was begun at about 6 p.m. The results are shown in diagram A; 68 per cent spawned between midnight and 3 a.m. and the bulk of the rest by 4 a.m. Only five of the 104 did not lay. The average number of eggs was very constant at about forty per female. There was no difficulty in finding primary oocysts with full metaphase plates in females fixed at 2 a.m."

Acetic, propionic and butyric acids were then established as the main components of the mixture in the rumen fluid of sheep and other ruminants. It was claimed that traces of acid or acids higher than butyric acid were indicated, but that no formic acid was present2."

In the biochemical field, glycolaldehyde has been identified as a by-product in yeast fermentations, by Neuberg2, who assumed that it arose via hydroxypyruvic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2016908242,THE recent death of the adult male and last survivor of the three Philippine tarsiers (Tarsius carbonarius) lately in the Zoological Society's menagerie has enabled me to determine the existence of a specialized cutaneous gland hitherto unknown. The only special glands of integumental origin so far known in Tarsius are the circumanal glands and those associated with the touch-pads of the manus and pes1.

At present a survey of Mediterranean blood properties and a search for sickle-cell disease are being undertaken by us among these various groups.

https://openalex.org/W1982887021,"COLLABORATION between Austrian, Norwegian and Swedish specialists gave the first accurate measurements of the content of uranium and radium in sea water1. These results have recently been confirmed by measurements on much more extensive material collected during the Swedish Deep-Sea Expedition2. Whereas uranium remains fairly constant (average content 1.3 × 10−6 gm. per litre), the radium content is more variable, averaging about 0.07 × 10−12 gm. per litre or 15 per cent of the theoretical value in equilibrium with the dissolved uranium. I have suggested that this lack of radium in ocean waters is due to precipitation of its parent element ionium together with ferric hydroxide3. This would also explain the surprisingly high radium content found in the surface layer of red clay and radiolarian ooze as ionium-supported radium, decreasing downwards with the half-period of ionium, 83,000 years. Such a falling-off in radium content was first demonstrated in long cores by Piggot and Urry4, and has been used in their attempts to estimate the rate of sedimentation."

https://openalex.org/W1972498751,"THE presence of atomic nitrogen1,2 in auroras is now proved beyond doubt by the identifications of the forbidden lines λ 3466 (2P → 4S) and λ 5200–5198 (2D → 4S). No specific processes for the dissociation of the nitrogen molecules or for the excitation of the nitrogen atoms appear to have been yet suggested. It is the purpose of this communication to show that dissociative recombination of N2+(X′) ions, as shown in reaction (1), can, at the same time, cause dissociation of nitrogen molecules and excitation of the resulting nitrogen atoms to the required metastable states."
https://openalex.org/W1965059567,"Dawsey, Urey and Rice1 claimed to have excited the OH-band 3064 A. in fluorescence in hydrogen peroxide vapour, the processes involved being: H2O2 + hν1 → HO + OH* OH* → OH + hν2. In these experiments, light from a zinc spark was passed through an acetone filter, which removed light of wave-lengths shorter than λ 2025, down a quartz tube containing hydrogen peroxide vapour and thence to the slit of the spectrograph. The OH-band appeared weakly against a spark ‘background’, the intensity of which in this region was partly reduced by the acetone filter. No exposure-time was given, and it is to be supposed that the spark was running in air."

https://openalex.org/W2021335954,"It has been shown that ethyl carbamate, which inhibits the tyrosine – tyrosinase reaction, accelerates the autoxidation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine to melanin1. Other substances known to inhibit the tyrosine – tyrosinase reaction have been investigated for this accelerating effect. One such substance is hydroquinone mono-benzyl ether2,3. The inhibition of the tyrosine – tyrosinase reaction by hydroquinone mono-benzyl ether was confirmed, but no evidence of any accelerating effect on the autoxidation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine was obtained; in fact, there was a small but definite degree of inhibition of this reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1981150434,"Erythrocytic fragmentation, produced by the incessant buffeting in the circulation, has been considered by several authors1,2 to be the most important factor in the destruction of erythrocytes. This fragmentation was thought to be much increased in thalassaemia major (Cooley's anaemia), where poikilocytosis and schizocytosis are very evident3–5. Nevertheless, there are few experimental records of mechanical fragmentation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1985325386,"THORNE1 described Ditylenchus destructor from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) in Idaho, U.S.A., and recorded Taraxacum officinale Weber as a host. Baker2 identified D. destructor from potato tubers in Prince Edward Island. Baker4, working with a species of Ditylenchus infesting the roots of Mentha arvensis L. and conforming closely to Thorne's1 description of D. destructor, transferred this nematode from M. arvensis to the potato tuber; typical potato-rot nematode injury was produced, thus confirming its identity as D. destructor. Baker4 also made successful transfers of D. destructor from potato tubers and the roots of M. arvensis to the sweet potato and to onion bulbs (Allium cepa L.). He made successful return transfers from onion bulbs to potato tubers and to the sweet potato. Baker4 and Thorne5 have tentatively identified D. destructor from Trifolium pratense L. and Solidago graminifolia (L.) Salisb., the identification being subject to confirmation by transfer to potato tuber. Goodey and Goodey6 recorded Mentha arvensis L. and Sonchus arvensis L. as hosts of D. destructor at Rothamsted."
https://openalex.org/W2019167616,"STOLL et al.l,2 have isolated from senna (leaf and fruit of Cassia acutifolia Delile and C. angustifolia Vahl.) the active glycosides, sennosides A and B, which, they state, represent about 90 per cent of the total glycosidal content. No evidence is given, however, that the entire activity of the crude drug is due to these glycosides."

It has been found that, in addition to relaxation by thermo-elastic currents, the internal friction at room temperature (26° C.) shows two other common peaks independent of the diameter, one at 50 c./s. and the other at 500 c./s. Evidence for the peak at 50 c./s. has already been given by one of us1."
