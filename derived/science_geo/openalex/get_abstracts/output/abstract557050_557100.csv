https://openalex.org/W2326834550,"Granulomas are the pathological hallmark of tuberculosis (TB). However, their function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood. To understand the role of granulomas in TB, we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner. Using laser-capture microdissection, mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy, we generated detailed molecular maps of human granulomas. We found that the centers of granulomas have a pro-inflammatory environment that is characterized by the presence of antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Conversely, the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature. These findings are consistent across a set of six human subjects and in rabbits. Although the balance between systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to TB disease outcome, here we find that these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma. From the protein and lipid snapshots of human and rabbit lesions analyzed here, we hypothesize that the pathologic response to TB is shaped by the precise anatomical localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the granuloma."

Although this capacity has been linked to the default mode network (DMN), it remains unclear how interactions between the nodes of this network give rise to particular mental experiences during spontaneous thought. One hypothesis is that the core of the DMN integrates information from medial and lateral temporal lobe memory systems, which represent different aspects of knowledge. Individual differences in the connectivity between temporal lobe regions and the default mode network core would then predict differences in the content and form of people’s spontaneous thoughts. This study tested this hypothesis by examining the relationship between seed-based functional connectivity and the contents of spontaneous thought recorded in a laboratory study several days later. Variations in connectivity from both medial and lateral temporal lobe regions was associated with different patterns of spontaneous thought and these effects converged on an overlapping region in the posterior cingulate cortex. We propose that the posterior core of the DMN acts as a representational hub that integrates information represented in medial and lateral temporal lobe and this process is important in determining the content and form of spontaneous thought."
https://openalex.org/W2309167097,"Mammals have partially lost the extensive regenerative capabilities of some vertebrates, possibly as a result of chromatin-remodeling mechanisms that enforce terminal differentiation. Here, we show that deleting the SWI/SNF component Arid1a substantially improves mammalian regeneration. Arid1a expression is suppressed in regenerating tissues, and genetic deletion of Arid1a increases tissue repair following an array of injuries. Arid1a deficiency in the liver increases proliferation, reduces tissue damage and fibrosis, and improves organ function following surgical resection and chemical injuries. Hepatocyte-specific deletion is also sufficient to increase proliferation and regeneration without excessive overgrowth, and global Arid1a disruption potentiates soft tissue healing in the ear. We show that Arid1a loss reprograms chromatin to restrict promoter access by transcription factors such as C/ebpα, which enforces differentiation, and E2F4, which suppresses cell-cycle re-entry. Thus, epigenetic reprogramming mediated by deletion of a single gene improves mammalian regeneration and suggests strategies to promote tissue repair after injury."
https://openalex.org/W2338492934,"TNF-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) is a multifunctional protein secreted in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli by a wide range of cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, and endothelial cells. It has been shown to mediate anti-inflammatory and protective effects when administered in disease models, in part, by reducing neutrophil infiltration. Human TSG-6 inhibits neutrophil migration by binding CXCL8 through its Link module (Link_TSG6) and interfering with the presentation of CXCL8 on cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), an interaction that is vital for the function of many chemokines. TSG-6 was also found to interact with chemokines CXCL11 and CCL5, suggesting the possibility that it may function as a broad specificity chemokine-binding protein, functionally similar to those encoded by viruses. This study was therefore undertaken to explore the ability of TSG-6 to regulate the function of other chemokines. Herein, we demonstrate that Link_TSG6 binds chemokines from both the CXC and CC families, including CXCL4, CXCL12, CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, CCL19, CCL21, and CCL27. We also show that the Link_TSG6-binding sites on chemokines overlap with chemokine GAG-binding sites, and that the affinities of Link_TSG6 for these chemokines (KD values 1–85 nm) broadly correlate with chemokine-GAG affinities. Link_TSG6 also inhibits chemokine presentation on endothelial cells not only through a direct interaction with chemokines but also by binding and therefore masking the availability of GAGs. Along with previous work, these findings suggest that TSG-6 functions as a pluripotent regulator of chemokines by modulating chemokine/GAG interactions, which may be a major mechanism by which TSG-6 produces its anti-inflammatory effects in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2338976022,"Reaching universal HIV-status awareness is crucial to ensure all HIV-infected patients access antiretroviral treatment (ART) and achieve virological suppression. Opportunities for HIV testing could be enhanced by offering self-testing in populations that fear stigma and discrimination when accessing conventional HIV Counselling and Testing (HCT) in health care facilities. This qualitative research aims to examine the feasibility and acceptability of unsupervised oral self-testing for home use in an informal settlement of South Africa. Eleven in-depth interviews, two couple interviews, and two focus group discussions were conducted with seven healthcare workers and thirteen community members. Thematic analysis was done concurrently with data collection. Acceptability to offer home self-testing was demonstrated in this research. Home self-testing might help this population overcome barriers to accepting HCT; this was particularly expressed in the male and youth groups. Nevertheless, pilot interventions must provide evidence of potential harm related to home self-testing, intensify efforts to offer quality counselling, and ensure linkage to HIV/ART-care following a positive self-test result."
https://openalex.org/W2418680276,"The accumulation of γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs) at the appropriate postsynaptic sites is critical for determining the efficacy of fast inhibitory neurotransmission. Although we know that the majority of synaptic GABAAR subtypes are assembled from α1–3, β, and γ2 subunits, our understanding of how neurons facilitate their targeting to and stabilization at inhibitory synapses is rudimentary. To address these issues, we have created knock-in mice in which the pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the Myc epitope were introduced to the extracellular domain of the mature receptor α2 subunit (pHα2). Using immunoaffinity purification and mass spectroscopy, we identified a stable complex of 174 proteins that were associated with pHα2, including other GABAAR subunits, and previously identified receptor-associated proteins such as gephyrin and collybistin. 149 of these proteins were novel GABAAR binding partners and included G-protein-coupled receptors and ion channel subunits, proteins that regulate trafficking and degradation, regulators of protein phosphorylation, GTPases, and a number of proteins that regulate their activity. Notably, members of the postsynaptic density family of proteins that are critical components of excitatory synapses were not associated with GABAARs. Crucially, we demonstrated for a subset of these novel proteins (including cullin1, ephexin, potassium channel tetramerization domain containing protein 12, mitofusin2, metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, p21-activated kinase 7, and Ras-related protein 5A) bind directly to the intracellular domains of GABAARs, validating our proteomic analysis. Thus, our experiments illustrate the complexity of the GABAAR proteome and enhance our understanding of the mechanisms neurons use to construct inhibitory synapses.

https://openalex.org/W2328925430,"Background CD19+CD24hiCD38hi transitional immature B-lymphocytes have been demonstrated to play an important role in regulating the alloimmune response in transplant recipients. Here, we analyzed the effect of calcineurin inhibition on these peripherally circulating regulatory B-cells (Breg) in renal transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine A (CsA) or tacrolimus. Methods PBMCs from healthy subjects (HS) (n = 16) and renal transplant recipients (n = 46) were isolated. Flow cytometry was performed for CD19, CD24, CD38 and IL-10 either after isolation or after 72 hours of co-culture in presence of PMA/Ionomycin and TLR9-ligand in presence or absence of increasing concentrations of tacrolimus or CsA. Results The amount of CD19+ B-cells among lymphocytes was ∼9.1% in HS, ∼3.6% in CsA (n = 11, p<0.05) and ∼6.4% in TAC (n = 35, p<0.05) treated patients. Among B-cells, a distinct subset of Breg was found to be 4.7% in HS, 1.4% in tacrolimus treated patients and almost blunted in patients receiving CsA. Similarily, ∼4% of B-cells in HS and even fewer in CsA or tacrolimus treated patients produced IL-10 (0.5% and 1.5%, p<0.05) and this was confirmed both in non-transplanted CsA-treated healthy subjects and in in vitro co-culture experiments. Among 29 patients with <1% of Breg, 9 cases (31%) displayed an allograft rejection in contrast to only one case of rejection (6%) among 17 patients with >1%. Conclusion Calcineurin inhibitors reduce number and IL-10 production of Bregs in the peripheral circulation of both renal transplant recipients and non-transplanted healthy subjects. CNI induced Breg reduction is not restricted to a solid organ transplant setting and is not mediated by co-medication with steroids or MPA. A low proportion of Breg cells is associated with an elevated frequency of allograft rejection events."
https://openalex.org/W2339778180,"Molecular oxygen and carbon dioxide are the primary gaseous substrate and product of oxidative metabolism, respectively. Hypoxia (low oxygen) and hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide) are co-incidental features of the tissue microenvironment in a range of pathophysiologic states, including acute and chronic respiratory diseases. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is the master regulator of the transcriptional response to hypoxia; however, little is known about the impact of hypercapnia on gene transcription. Because of the relationship between hypoxia and hypercapnia, we investigated the effect of hypercapnia on the HIF pathway. Hypercapnia suppressed HIF-α protein stability and HIF target gene expression both in mice and cultured cells in a manner that was at least in part independent of the canonical O2-dependent HIF degradation pathway. The suppressive effects of hypercapnia on HIF-α protein stability could be mimicked by reducing intracellular pH at a constant level of partial pressure of CO2. Bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase that blocks lysosomal degradation, prevented the hypercapnic suppression of HIF-α protein. Based on these results, we hypothesize that hypercapnia counter-regulates activation of the HIF pathway by reducing intracellular pH and promoting lysosomal degradation of HIF-α subunits. Therefore, hypercapnia may play a key role in the pathophysiology of diseases where HIF is implicated."
https://openalex.org/W2410663946,"Pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to pancreatic beta cell apoptosis in type 1 diabetes at least in part by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the consequent unfolded protein response (UPR). It remains to be determined what causes the transition from “physiological” to “apoptotic” UPR, but accumulating evidence indicates that signaling by the ER transmembrane protein IRE1α is critical for this transition. IRE1α activation is regulated by both intra-ER and cytosolic cues. We evaluated the role for the presently discovered cytokine-induced and IRE1α-interacting protein ubiquitin D (UBD) on the regulation of IRE1α and its downstream targets. UBD was identified by use of a MAPPIT (mammalian protein-protein interaction trap)-based IRE1α interactome screen followed by comparison against functional genomic analysis of human and rodent beta cells exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Knockdown of UBD in human and rodent beta cells and detailed signal transduction studies indicated that UBD modulates cytokine-induced UPR/IRE1α activation and apoptosis. UBD expression is induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and interferon (IFN)-γ in rat and human pancreatic beta cells, and it is also up-regulated in beta cells of inflamed islets from non-obese diabetic mice. UBD interacts with IRE1α in human and rodent beta cells, modulating IRE1α-dependent activation of JNK and cytokine-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that UBD provides a negative feedback on cytokine-induced activation of the IRE1α/JNK pro-apoptotic pathway in cytokine-exposed beta cells.

https://openalex.org/W2315751674,"Pah1 phosphatidate phosphatase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalyzes the penultimate step in the synthesis of triacylglycerol (i.e. the production of diacylglycerol by dephosphorylation of phosphatidate). The enzyme playing a major role in lipid metabolism is subject to phosphorylation (e.g. by Pho85-Pho80, Cdc28-cyclin B, and protein kinases A and C) and dephosphorylation (e.g. by Nem1-Spo7) that regulate its cellular location, catalytic activity, and stability/degradation. In this work, we show that Pah1 is a substrate for casein kinase II (CKII); its phosphorylation was time- and dose-dependent and was dependent on the concentrations of Pah1 (Km = 0.23 μm) and ATP (Km = 5.5 μm). By mass spectrometry, truncation analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, phosphopeptide mapping, and phosphoamino acid analysis, we identified that >90% of its phosphorylation occurs on Thr-170, Ser-250, Ser-313, Ser-705, Ser-814, and Ser-818. The CKII-phosphorylated Pah1 was a substrate for the Nem1-Spo7 protein phosphatase and was degraded by the 20S proteasome. The prephosphorylation of Pah1 by protein kinase A or protein kinase C reduced its subsequent phosphorylation by CKII. The prephosphorylation of Pah1 by CKII reduced its subsequent phosphorylation by protein kinase A but not by protein kinase C. The expression of Pah1 with combined mutations of S705D and 7A, which mimic its phosphorylation by CKII and lack of phosphorylation by Pho85-Pho80, caused an increase in triacylglycerol content and lipid droplet number in cells expressing the Nem1-Spo7 phosphatase complex."
https://openalex.org/W2340445855,"Lake restoration practices based on reducing fish predation and promoting the dominance of large-bodied Daphnia grazers (i.e., biomanipulation) have been the focus of much debate due to inconsistent success in suppressing harmful cyanobacterial blooms. While most studies have explored effects of large-bodied Daphnia on cyanobacterial growth at the community level and/or on few dominant species, predictions of such restoration practices demand further understanding on taxa-specific responses in diverse cyanobacterial communities. In order to address these questions, we conducted three grazing experiments during summer in a eutrophic lake where the natural phytoplankton community was exposed to an increasing gradient in biomass of the large-bodied Daphnia magna. This allowed evaluating taxa-specific responses of cyanobacteria to Daphnia grazing throughout the growing season in a desired biomanipulation scenario with limited fish predation. Total cyanobacterial and phytoplankton biomasses responded negatively to Daphnia grazing both in early and late summer, regardless of different cyanobacterial densities. Large-bodied Daphnia were capable of suppressing the abundance of Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum, Microcystis and Planktothrix bloom-forming cyanobacteria. However, the growth of the filamentous Dolichospermum crassum was positively affected by grazing during a period when this cyanobacterium dominated the community. The eutrophic lake was subjected to biomanipulation since 2005 and nineteen years of lake monitoring data (1996-2014) revealed that reducing fish predation increased the mean abundance (50%) and body-size (20%) of Daphnia, as well as suppressed the total amount of nutrients and the growth of the dominant cyanobacterial taxa, Microcystis and Planktothrix. Altogether our results suggest that lake restoration practices solely based on grazer control by large-bodied Daphnia can be effective, but may not be sufficient to control the overgrowth of all cyanobacterial diversity. Although controlling harmful cyanobacterial blooms should preferably include other measures, such as nutrient reductions, our experimental assessment of taxa-specific cyanobacterial responses to large-bodied Daphnia and long-term monitoring data highlights the potential of such biomanipulations to enhance the ecological and societal value of eutrophic water bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2316476189,"Non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) have many health benefits, including immunomodulatory activity, lowering serum cholesterol, a faecal bulking effect, enhanced absorption of certain minerals, prebiotic effects and the amelioration of type II diabetes. The principal components of the NSP in cereal grains are (1,3;1,4)-β-glucans and arabinoxylans. Although (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan (hereafter called β-glucan) is not the most representative component of wheat cell walls, it is one of the most important types of soluble fibre in terms of its proven beneficial effects on human health. In the present work we explored the genetic variability of β-glucan content in grains from a tetraploid wheat collection that had been genotyped with a 90k-iSelect array, and combined this data to carry out an association analysis. The β-glucan content, expressed as a percentage w/w of grain dry weight, ranged from 0.18% to 0.89% across the collection. Our analysis identified seven genomic regions associated with β-glucan, located on chromosomes 1A, 2A (two), 2B, 5B and 7A (two), confirming the quantitative nature of this trait. Analysis of marker trait associations (MTAs) in syntenic regions of several grass species revealed putative candidate genes that might influence β-glucan levels in the endosperm, possibly via their participation in carbon partitioning. These include the glycosyl hydrolases endo-β-(1,4)-glucanase (cellulase), β-amylase, (1,4)-β-xylan endohydrolase, xylanase inhibitor protein I, isoamylase and the glycosyl transferase starch synthase II."
https://openalex.org/W2341029509,"In hospitals around the world, there has been no consensus regarding which clinical activities a pharmacist should focus on until recently. In 2011, a Canadian clinical pharmacy key performance indicator (cpKPI) collaborative was formed. The goal of the collaborative was to advance pharmacy practice in order to improve patient outcomes and enhance the quality of care provided to patients by hospital pharmacists. Following a literature review, which indicated that pharmacists can improve patient outcomes by carrying out specific activities, and an evidence-informed consensus process, a final set of eight cpKPIs were established. Canadian hospitals leading the cpKPI initiative are currently in the early stages of implementing these indicators.To explore pharmacists' perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of cpKPIs.Clinical pharmacists employed by the Nova Scotia Health Authority were invited to participate in focus groups. Focus group discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed, and data was analyzed using thematic analysis.Three focus groups, including 26 pharmacists, were conducted in February 2015. Three major themes were identified. Resisting the change was comprised of documentation challenges, increased workload, practice environment constraints, and competing priorities. Embracing cpKPIs was composed of seeing the benefit, demonstrating value, and existing supports. Navigating the unknown was made up of quality versus quantity battle, and insights into the future.Although pharmacists were challenged by documentation and other changes associated with the implementation of cpKPIs, they demonstrated significant support for cpKPIs and were able to see benefits of the implementation. Pharmacists came up with suggestions for overcoming resistance associated with the implementation of cpKPIs and provided insights into the future of pharmacy practice. The identification of barriers and facilitators to cpKPI implementation will be used to inform the implementation process on a local and national level."
https://openalex.org/W2332900199,"Food stimuli are omnipresent and naturally primary reinforcing stimuli. One explanation for the intake of high amounts of food in binge eating disorder (BED) is a deviant valuation process. Valuation of food stimuli is supposed to influence approach or avoidance behaviour towards food. Focusing on self-reported and indirect (facial electromyography) valuation process, motivational aspects in the processing of food stimuli were investigated.We compared an overweight sample with BED (BED+) with an overweight sample without BED (BED-) and with normal weight controls (NWC) regarding their self-reported and indirect (via facial electromyography) valuation of food versus non-food stimuli.Regarding the self-reported valuation, the BED+ sample showed a significantly stronger food-bias compared to the BED- sample, as food stimuli were rated as significantly more positive than the non-food stimuli in the BED+ sample. This self-reported valuation pattern could not be displayed in the indirect valuation. Food stimuli evoked negative indirect valuation in all groups. The BED+ sample showed the plainest approach-avoidance conflict marked by a diverging self-reported (positive) and indirect (negative) valuation of food stimuli.BED+ showed a deviant self-reported valuation of food as compared to BED-. The valuation process of the BED+ sample seems to be characterized by a motivational ambivalence. This ambivalence should be subject of further studies and may be of potential use for therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2322420990,"Genome-wide insight into insect pest response to the infection of Beauveria bassiana (fungal insect pathogen) is critical for genetic improvement of fungal insecticides but has been poorly explored. We constructed three pairs of transcriptomes of Plutella xylostella larvae at 24, 36 and 48 hours post treatment of infection (hptI) and of control (hptC) for insight into the host-pathogen interaction at genomic level. There were 2143, 3200 and 2967 host genes differentially expressed at 24, 36 and 48 hptI/hptC respectively. These infection-responsive genes (~15% of the host genome) were enriched in various immune processes, such as complement and coagulation cascades, protein digestion and absorption, and drug metabolism-cytochrome P450. Fungal penetration into cuticle and host defense reaction began at 24 hptI, followed by most intensive host immune response at 36 hptI and attenuated immunity at 48 hptI. Contrastingly, 44% of fungal genes were differentially expressed in the infection course and enriched in several biological processes, such as antioxidant activity, peroxidase activity and proteolysis. There were 1636 fungal genes co-expressed during 24-48 hptI, including 116 encoding putative secretion proteins. Our results provide novel insights into the insect-pathogen interaction and help to probe molecular mechanisms involved in the fungal infection to the global pest."
https://openalex.org/W2338604174,"Hematopoietic and leukemic stem cells (HSCs and LSCs) have self-renewal ability to maintain normal hematopoiesis and leukemia propagation, respectively. Tcf1 and Lef1 transcription factors are expressed in HSCs, and targeting both factors modestly expanded the size of the HSC pool due to diminished HSC quiescence. Functional defects of Tcf1/Lef1-deficient HSCs in multi-lineage blood reconstitution was only evident under competitive conditions or when subjected to repeated regenerative stress. These are mechanistically due to direct positive regulation of Egr and Tcf3 by Tcf1 and Lef1, and significantly, forced expression of Egr1 in Tcf1/Lef1-deficient HSCs restored HSC quiescence. In a preclinical CML model, loss of Tcf1/Lef1 did not show strong impact on leukemia initiation and progression. However, when transplanted into secondary recipients, Tcf1/Lef1-deficient LSCs failed to propagate CML. By induced deletion of Tcf1 and Lef1 in pre-established CML, we further demonstrated an intrinsic requirement for these factors in LSC self-renewal. When combined with imatinib therapy, genetic targeting of Tcf1 and Lef1 potently diminished LSCs and conferred better protection to the CML recipients. LSCs are therefore more sensitive to loss of Tcf1 and Lef1 than HSCs in their self-renewal capacity. The differential requirements in HSCs and LSCs thus identify Tcf1 and Lef1 transcription factors as novel therapeutic targets in treating hematological malignancies, and inhibition of Tcf1/Lef1-regulated transcriptional programs may thus provide a therapeutic window to eliminate LSCs with minimal side effect on normal HSC functions."

To gain insight into the molecular basis for the functions of PLEKHA7, we looked for new PLEKHA7 interactors. Here, we report the identification of PDZ domain-containing protein 11 (PDZD11) as a new interactor of PLEKHA7 by yeast two-hybrid screening and by mass spectrometry analysis of PLEKHA7 immunoprecipitates. We show that PDZD11 (17 kDa) is expressed in epithelial and endothelial cells, where it forms a complex with PLEKHA7, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. The N-terminal Trp-Trp (WW) domain of PLEKHA7 interacts directly with the N-terminal 44 amino acids of PDZD11, as shown by GST-pulldown assays. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that PDZD11 is localized at adherens junctions in a PLEKHA7-dependent manner, because its junctional localization is abolished by knock-out of PLEKHA7, and is rescued by re-expression of exogenous PLEKHA7. The junctional recruitment of nectin-1 and nectin-3 and their protein levels are decreased via proteasome-mediated degradation in epithelial cells where either PDZD11 or PLEKHA7 have been knocked-out.

https://openalex.org/W2338860057,"Two blue mussel lineages of Pliocene origin, Mytilus edulis (ME) and M. trossulus (MT), co-occur and hybridize in several regions on the shores of the North Atlantic. The two species were distinguished from each other by molecular methods in the 1980s, and a large amount of comparative data on them has been accumulated since that time. However, while ME and MT are now routinely distinguished by various genetic markers, they tend to be overlooked in ecological studies since morphological characters for taxonomic identification have been lacking, and no consistent habitat differences between lineages have been reported. Surveying a recently discovered area of ME and MT co-occurrence in the White Sea and employing a set of allozyme markers for identification, we address the issue whether ME and MT are true biological species with distinct ecological characteristics or just virtual genetic entities with no matching morphological and ecological identities. We find that: (1) in the White Sea, the occurrence of MT is largely concentrated in harbors, in line with observations from other subarctic regions of Europe; (2) mixed populations of ME and MT are always dominated by purebred individuals, animals classified as hybrids constituting only ca. 18%; (3) in terms of shell morphology, 80% of MT bear a distinct uninterrupted dark prismatic strip under the ligament while 97% of ME lack this character; (4) at sites of sympatry MT is more common on algal substrates while ME mostly lives directly on the bottom. This segregation by the substrate may contribute to maintaining reproductive isolation and decreasing competition between taxa. We conclude that while ME and MT are not fully reproductively isolated, they do represent clearly distinguishable biological, ecological and morphological entities in the White Sea. It remains to be documented whether the observed morphological and ecological differences are of a local character, or whether they have simply been overlooked in other contact zones."
https://openalex.org/W2339837954,"Accurate distinction between peptide sequences that can form amyloid-fibrils or amorphous β-aggregates, identification of potential aggregation prone regions in proteins, and prediction of change in aggregation rate of a protein upon mutation(s) are critical to research on protein misfolding diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, as well as biotechnological production of protein based therapeutics. We have developed a Curated Protein Aggregation Database (CPAD), which has collected results from experimental studies performed by scientific community aimed at understanding protein/peptide aggregation. CPAD contains more than 2300 experimentally observed aggregation rates upon mutations in known amyloidogenic proteins. Each entry includes numerical values for the following parameters: change in rate of aggregation as measured by fluorescence intensity or turbidity, name and source of the protein, Uniprot and Protein Data Bank codes, single point as well as multiple mutations, and literature citation. The data in CPAD has been supplemented with five different types of additional information: (i) Amyloid fibril forming hexa-peptides, (ii) Amorphous β-aggregating hexa-peptides, (iii) Amyloid fibril forming peptides of different lengths, (iv) Amyloid fibril forming hexa-peptides whose crystal structures are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and (v) Experimentally validated aggregation prone regions found in amyloidogenic proteins. Furthermore, CPAD is linked to other related databases and resources, such as Uniprot, Protein Data Bank, PUBMED, GAP, TANGO, WALTZ etc. We have set up a web interface with different search and display options so that users have the ability to get the data in multiple ways. CPAD is freely available at http://www.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo/CPAD/. The potential applications of CPAD have also been discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2340021318,"Pathogenic Leptospira strains are responsible for leptospirosis, a worldwide emerging zoonotic disease. These spirochetes are unique amongst bacteria because of their corkscrew-like cell morphology and their periplasmic flagella. Motility is reported as an important virulence determinant, probably favoring entry and dissemination of pathogenic Leptospira in the host. However, proteins constituting the periplasmic flagella and their role in cell shape, motility and virulence remain poorly described. In this study, we characterized a spontaneous L. interrogans mutant strain lacking motility, correlated with the loss of the characteristic hook-shaped ends, and virulence in the animal model. Whole genome sequencing allowed the identification of one nucleotide deletion in the fliM gene resulting in a premature stop codon, thereby preventing the production of flagellar motor switch protein FliM. Genetic complementation restored cell morphology, motility and virulence comparable to those of wild type cells. Analyses of purified periplasmic flagella revealed a defect in flagella assembly, resulting in shortened flagella compared to the wild type strain. This also correlated with a lower amount of major filament proteins FlaA and FlaB. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that FliM is required for full and correct assembly of the flagella which is essential for motility and virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2337966079,"Background High salt consumption is an important risk factor of elevated blood pressure. In Bangladesh about 20 million people are at high risk of hypertension due to climate change induced saline intrusion in water. The objective of this study is to assess beliefs, perceptions, and practices associated with salt consumption in coastal Bangladesh. Methods The study was conducted in Chakaria, Bangladesh between April-June 2011. It was a cross sectional mixed method study. For the qualitative study 6 focus group discussions, 8 key informant interviews, 60 free listing exercises, 20 ranking exercises and 10 observations were conducted. 400 adults were randomly selected for quantitative survey. For analysis we used SPSS for quantitative data, and Anthropac and Nvivo for qualitative data. Results Salt was described as an essential component of food with strong cultural and religious roots. People described both health benefits and risks related to salt intake. The overall risk perception regarding excessive salt consumption was low and respondents believed that the cooking process can render the salt harmless. Respondents were aware that salt is added in many foods even if they do not taste salty but did not recognize that salt can occur naturally in both foods and water. Conclusions In the study community people had low awareness of the risks associated with excess salt consumption and salt reduction strategies were not high in their agenda. The easy access to and low cost of salt as well as unrecognised presence of salt in drinking water has created an environment conducive to excess salt consumption. It is important to design general messages related to salt reduction and test tailored strategies especially for those at high risk of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2338849552,"The Johnston’s Organ neurons (JONs) form chemical and electrical synapses onto the giant fiber neuron (GF), as part of the neuronal circuit that mediates the GF escape response in Drosophila melanogaster. The purpose of this study was to identify which of the 8 Drosophila innexins (invertebrate gap junction proteins) mediates the electrical connection at this synapse. The GF is known to express Shaking B (ShakB), specifically the ShakB(N+16) isoform only, at its output synapses in the thorax. The shakB2 mutation disrupts these GF outputs and also abolishes JON-GF synaptic transmission. However, the identity of the innexin that forms the presynaptic hemichannels in the JONs remains unknown. We used electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry and dye injection, along with presynaptically-driven RNA interference, to investigate this question. The amplitude of the compound action potential recorded in response to sound from the base of the antenna (sound-evoked potential, or SEP) was reduced by RNAi of the innexins Ogre, Inx3, Inx6 and, to a lesser extent Inx2, suggesting that they could be required in JONs for proper development, excitability, or synchronization of action potentials. The strength of the JON-GF connection itself was reduced to background levels only by RNAi of shakB, not of the other seven innexins. ShakB knockdown prevented Neurobiotin coupling between GF and JONs and removed the plaques of ShakB protein immunoreactivity that are present at the region of contact. Specific shakB RNAi lines that are predicted to target the ShakB(L) or ShakB(N) isoforms alone did not reduce the synaptic strength, implying that it is ShakB(N+16) that is required in the presynaptic neurons. Overexpression of ShakB(N+16) in JONs caused the formation of ectopic dye coupling, whereas ShakB(N) prevented it altogether, supporting this conclusion and also suggesting that gap junction proteins may have an instructive role in synaptic target choice."
https://openalex.org/W2341229534,"Significant proteolysis may occur during milk synthesis and secretion, as evidenced by the presence of protease-protease inhibitor complex containing the activated form of the type 2 transmembrane serine protease matriptase and the transmembrane Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor HAI-1. In order to identify other proteolysis events that may occur during lactation, human milk was analyzed for species containing HAI-1 and HAI-2 which is closely related to HAI-1. In addition to the previously demonstrated matriptase-HAI-1 complex, HAI-1 was also detected in complex with prostasin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored serine protease. HAI-2 was also detected in complexes, the majority of which appear to be part of higher-order complexes, which do not bind to ionic exchange columns or immunoaffinity columns, suggesting that HAI-2 and its target proteases may be incorporated into special protein structures during lactation. The small proportion HAI-2 species that could be purified contain matriptase or prostasin. Human mammary epithelial cells are the likely cellular sources for these HAI-1 and HAI-2 complexes with matriptase and prostasin given that these protease-inhibitor complexes with the exception of prostasin-HAI-2 complex were detected in milk-derived mammary epithelial cells. The presence of these protease-inhibitor complexes in human milk provides in vivo evidence that the proteolytic activity of matriptase and prostasin are significantly elevated at least during lactation, and possibly contribute to the process of lactation, and that they are under tight control by HAI-1 and HAI-2."
https://openalex.org/W2342137674,"In many Sub-Saharan African settings male partner involvement in antenatal care (ANC) remains low, although great benefits for maternal and infant health outcomes have been long recognised, in particular regarding the prevention of HIV transmission. Yet there is paucity on evidence regarding the effectiveness of strategies to increase male partner involvement. This controlled intervention trial in Ruanda Health Centre in Mbeya, Tanzania, assessed the effectiveness of invitation letters for male involvement in ANC. Pregnant women approaching ANC without partners received official letters inviting the partner to attend ANC. A control group was instructed to verbally invite partners. Partner attendance was recorded at two subsequent ANC visits. Rates for male partner return, couple voluntary counselling and testing (CVCT), and influencing factors were analysed. From 199 ANC clients in total, 97 were assigned to the invitation letter group; 30 of these (30.9%) returned with their male partners for ANC. In the control group of 102 women, 28 (27.5%) returned with their partner. In both groups CVCT rates among jointly returning couples were 100%. Partner return/CVCT rate was not statistically different in intervention and control group (OR 1.2, p = 0.59). Former partner attendance at ANC during a previous pregnancy was the only factor found to be significantly linked with partner return (p = 0.03). Our study demonstrates that rather simple measures to increase male partner attendance in ANC and CVCT can be effective, with written and verbal invitations having comparable outcomes. In terms of practicability in Sub-Saharan African settings, we recommend systematic coaching of ANC clients on how to verbally invite male partners in the first instance, followed by written invitation letters for partners in case of their non-attendance. Further studies covering both urban and rural settings will be more informative for effective translation into policy."

Unexpectedly, CRP binding to ES-62 failed to efficiently activate complement as far as the C3 convertase stage in comparison with PCh-BSA and PCh-containing Streptococcus pneumoniae cell wall polysaccharide. C1q capture assays demonstrated an ES-62-CRP-C1q interaction in serum. The three ligands all activated C1 and generated C4b to similar extents. However, a C2a active site was not generated following ES-62 binding to CRP, demonstrating that C2 cleavage was far less efficient for ES-62-containing complexes. We proposed that failure of C2 cleavage was due to the flexible nature of carbohydrate-bound PCh and that reduced proximity of the C1 complex was the reason that C2 was poorly cleaved. This was confirmed using synthetic analogues that were similar to ES-62 only in respect of having a flexible PCh. Furthermore, ES-62 was shown to deplete early complement components, such as the rate-limiting C4, following CRP interaction and thereby inhibit classical pathway activation. Thus, flexible PCh-glycan represents a novel mechanism for subversion of complement activation.

https://openalex.org/W2342230497,"Real-time vaccination following an outbreak can effectively mitigate the damage caused by an infectious disease. However, in many cases, available resources are insufficient to vaccinate the entire at-risk population, logistics result in delayed vaccine deployment, and the interaction between members of different cities facilitates a wide spatial spread of infection. Limited vaccine, time delays, and interaction (or coupling) of cities lead to tradeoffs that impact the overall magnitude of the epidemic. These tradeoffs mandate investigation of optimal strategies that minimize the severity of the epidemic by prioritizing allocation of vaccine to specific subpopulations. We use an SIR model to describe the disease dynamics of an epidemic which breaks out in one city and spreads to another. We solve a master equation to determine the resulting probability distribution of the final epidemic size. We then identify tradeoffs between vaccine, time delay, and coupling, and we determine the optimal vaccination protocols resulting from these tradeoffs."

MMP-9 efficiently degrades the extracellular matrix component gelatin, and the hemopexin domain of MMP-9 (PEX9) inhibits this degradation. To study the molecular basis of this inhibition, we generated GST fusion proteins containing PEX9 or truncated forms corresponding to specific structural blades (B1–B4) of PEX9. GST-PEX9 inhibited MMP-9-driven gelatin proteolysis, measured by gelatin zymography, FITC-gelatin conversion, and DQ-gelatin degradation assays. However, GST-PEX9 did not prevent the degradation of other MMP-9 substrates, such as a fluorogenic peptide, αB crystalline, or nonmuscular actin. Therefore, PEX9 may inhibit gelatin degradation by shielding gelatin and specifically preventing its binding to MMP-9. Accordingly, GST-PEX9 also abolished the degradation of gelatin by MMP-2, confirming that PEX9 is not an MMP-9 antagonist. Moreover, GST-B4 and, to a lesser extent, GST-B1 also inhibited gelatin degradation by MMP-9, indicating that these regions are responsible for the inhibitory activity of PEX9. Accordingly, ELISAs demonstrated that GST-B4 and GST-B1 specifically bound to gelatin.

Review processes at funding agencies, such as the U.S. National Science Foundation, consider plans to disseminate research across disciplinary bounds. Publication in the leading multidisciplinary journals, Nature and Science, may signify the epitome of successful interdisciplinary integration of research knowledge and cross-disciplinary dissemination of findings. But how interdisciplinary are they? The journals are multidisciplinary, but do the individual articles themselves draw upon multiple fields of knowledge and does their influence span disciplines? This research compares articles in three fields (Cell Biology, Physical Chemistry, and Cognitive Science) published in a leading disciplinary journal in each field to those published in Nature and Science. We find comparable degrees of interdisciplinary integration and only modest differences in cross-disciplinary diffusion. That said, though the rate of out-of-field diffusion might be comparable, the sheer reach of Nature and Science, indicated by their potent Journal Impact Factors, means that the diffusion of knowledge therein can far exceed that of leading disciplinary journals in some fields (such as Physical Chemistry and Cognitive Science in our samples)."
https://openalex.org/W2326008356,"Coptis (Ranunculaceae) contains 15 species and is one of the pharmaceutically most important plant genera in eastern Asia. Understanding of the evolution of morphological characters and phylogenetic relationships within the genus is very limited. Here, we present the first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genus based on two plastid and one nuclear markers. The phylogeny was reconstructed using Bayesian inference, as well as maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. The Swofford-Olsen-Waddell-Hillis and Bayesian tests were used to assess the strength of the conflicts between traditional taxonomic units and those suggested by the phylogenetic inferences. Evolution of morphological characters was inferred using Bayesian method to identify synapomorphies for the infrageneric lineages. Our data recognize two strongly supported clades within Coptis. The first clade contains subgenus Coptis and section Japonocoptis of subgenus Metacoptis, supported by morphological characters, such as traits of the central leaflet base, petal color, and petal shape. The second clade consists of section Japonocoptis of subgenus Metacoptis. Coptis morii is not united with C. quinquefolia, in contrast with the view that C. morii is a synonym of C. quinquefolia. Two varieties of C. chinensis do not cluster together. Coptis groenlandica and C. lutescens are reduced to C. trifolia and C. japonica, respectively. Central leaflet base, sepal shape, and petal blade carry a strong phylogenetic signal in Coptis, while leaf type, sepal and petal color, and petal shape exhibit relatively higher levels of evolutionary flexibility."

Additionally, we examine the inequalities and concentration of public expenditure between populations with and without Social Security. Results suggest that in the 2003-2011 period, the public expenditure gap between women with and without Social Security decreased 74%, however, the distribution is less equitable among women without Social Security, across the States. Despite high levels of coverage on each dimension of ANC explored, coverage of adequate ANC was lower among Social Security than non-Social Security women. This variability results in differences up to 1.5 times in State-adjusted maternal mortality rate at the same level of expense and maternal mortality rate, respectively. The increase in the economic resources is only a necessary condition for achieving improved health outcomes. Providing adequate health services and achieving efficient, effective and transparent use of resources in health, are critical elements for health systems performance. The attainment of universal effective coverage of maternal health and reducing maternal mortality in Mexico, requires the adjustment of policy innovations including the rules of allocation and execution of health resources. Health policies should be designed on a more holistic view promoting a balance between accessibility, effective implementation and rigorous stewardship."

In the caecal ligation and puncture animal model of sepsis, we demonstrated that systemic and colonic interleukin-6 levels are significantly increased coinciding with an impaired colonic barrier function. We therefore aimed to study the effect of therapeutic or curative administration of anti-IL6 antibodies on overall GI motility, colonic permeability and translocation of intestinal bacteria in blood and mesenteric lymph nodes in the mouse caecal ligation and puncture model.OF-1 mice were randomized to either the preventive or curative protocol, in which they received 1 mg/kg of antibodies to interleukin-6, or its IgG isotype control solution. They subsequently underwent either the caecal ligation and puncture procedure, or sham-surgery. GI motility was assessed 48 h following the procedure, as well as colonic permeability, serum and colon cytokines, colonic tight junction proteins at the mRNA level; cultures of blood and mesenteric lymph nodes were performed.Preventive administration of anti-interleukin-6 antibodies successfully counteracted the gastrointestinal motility disturbances and impaired colonic barrier function that could be observed in vehicle-treated septic animals. Serum and colonic levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly lower when animals were preventively treated with anti-interleukin-6 antibodies. A repetitive injection 24 h later resulted in the most pronounced effects. Curative treatment significantly lowered systemic and colonic inflammation markers while the effects on transit and permeability were unfortunately no longer significant.Caecal ligation and puncture resulted in septic ileus with an increased colonic permeability. Antibodies to interleukin-6 were able to ameliorate gastro-intestinal motility, suppress inflammation and normalize the permeability of the colonic wall, with the preventive administration combined with a repeat injection being far more efficacious than the sole preventive or curative one."

It is considered to be important for the evolution of cooperative behavior amongst humans. Though it has been widely studied theoretically, the empirical evidence of indirect reciprocity has thus far been limited and based solely on behavior in laboratory experiments. We provide evidence from an online environment where members can repeatedly ask and offer services to each other, free of charge. For the purpose of this study we created several new member profiles, which differ only in terms of their serving history. We then sent out a large number of service requests to different members from all over the world. We observe that a service request is more likely to be rewarded for those with a profile history of offering the service (to third parties) in the past. This provides clear evidence of (downstream) indirect reciprocity. We find no support for upstream indirect reciprocity (in this case, rewarding the service request after having previously received the service from third parties), however. Our evidence of downstream indirect reciprocity cannot be attributed to reputational effects concerning one’s trustworthiness as a service user."

https://openalex.org/W2341732087,"The spiking neural networks (SNNs) are the third generation of neural networks and perform remarkably well in cognitive tasks such as pattern recognition. The spike emitting and information processing mechanisms found in biological cognitive systems motivate the application of the hierarchical structure and temporal encoding mechanism in spiking neural networks, which have exhibited strong computational capability. However, the hierarchical structure and temporal encoding approach require neurons to process information serially in space and time respectively, which reduce the training efficiency significantly. For training the hierarchical SNNs, most existing methods are based on the traditional back-propagation algorithm, inheriting its drawbacks of the gradient diffusion and the sensitivity on parameters. To keep the powerful computation capability of the hierarchical structure and temporal encoding mechanism, but to overcome the low efficiency of the existing algorithms, a new training algorithm, the Normalized Spiking Error Back Propagation (NSEBP) is proposed in this paper. In the feedforward calculation, the output spike times are calculated by solving the quadratic function in the spike response model instead of detecting postsynaptic voltage states at all time points in traditional algorithms. Besides, in the feedback weight modification, the computational error is propagated to previous layers by the presynaptic spike jitter instead of the gradient decent rule, which realizes the layer-wised training. Furthermore, our algorithm investigates the mathematical relation between the weight variation and voltage error change, which makes the normalization in the weight modification applicable. Adopting these strategies, our algorithm outperforms the traditional SNN multi-layer algorithms in terms of learning efficiency and parameter sensitivity, that are also demonstrated by the comprehensive experimental results in this paper."

We strove to elucidate the single and combined impacts of these potential stressors, and how stress sensitivity varies among genetically different sibling groups. Enhanced by a circumstantial natural heat wave, warming and acidification increased mortalities and reduced growth in F. vesiculosus germlings. This impact, however, was mitigated by enhanced nutrient conditions. Survival under OAW conditions strongly varied among sibling groups hinting at a substantial adaptive potential of the natural Fucus populations in the Western Baltic. A three-day experimental upwelling caused severe mortality of Fucus germlings, which was substantially more severe in those sibling groups which previously had been exposed to OAW. Our results show that global (OAW), regional (nutrient enrichment) and local pressures (upwelling), both alone and co-occurring may have synergistic and antagonistic effects on survival and/or growth of Fucus germlings. This result emphasizes the need to consider combined stress effects."
https://openalex.org/W2341265324,"The negative symptoms of schizophrenia (SZ) are associated with a pattern of reinforcement learning (RL) deficits likely related to degraded representations of reward values. However, the RL tasks used to date have required active responses to both reward and punishing stimuli. Pavlovian biases have been shown to affect performance on these tasks through invigoration of action to reward and inhibition of action to punishment, and may be partially responsible for the effects found in patients. Forty-five patients with schizophrenia and 30 demographically-matched controls completed a four-stimulus reinforcement learning task that crossed action (""Go"" or ""NoGo"") and the valence of the optimal outcome (reward or punishment-avoidance), such that all combinations of action and outcome valence were tested. Behaviour was modelled using a six-parameter RL model and EEG was simultaneously recorded. Patients demonstrated a reduction in Pavlovian performance bias that was evident in a reduced Go bias across the full group. In a subset of patients administered clozapine, the reduction in Pavlovian bias was enhanced. The reduction in Pavlovian bias in SZ patients was accompanied by feedback processing differences at the time of the P3a component. The reduced Pavlovian bias in patients is suggested to be due to reduced fidelity in the communication between striatal regions and frontal cortex. It may also partially account for previous findings of poorer ""Go-learning"" in schizophrenia where ""Go"" responses or Pavlovian consistent responses are required for optimal performance. An attenuated P3a component dynamic in patients is consistent with a view that deficits in operant learning are due to impairments in adaptively using feedback to update representations of stimulus value."
https://openalex.org/W2337709368,"Background Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the most common type of vertigo in the general population, is thought to be caused by dislodgement of otoliths from otolithic organs into the semicircular canals. In most cases, however, the cause behind the otolith dislodgement is unknown. Dental procedures, one of the most common medical treatments, are considered to be a possible cause of BPPV, although this has yet to be proven. This study is the first nationwide population-based case-control study conducted to investigate the correlation between BPPV and dental manipulation. Methods Patients diagnosed with BPPV between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2012 were recruited from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. We further identified those who had undergone dental procedures within 1 month and within 3 months before the first diagnosis date of BPPV. We also identified the comorbidities of the patients with BPPV, including head trauma, osteoporosis, migraine, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and stroke. These variables were then compared to those in age- and gender-matched controls. Results In total, 768 patients with BPPV and 1536 age- and gender-matched controls were recruited. In the BPPV group, 9.2% of the patients had undergone dental procedures within 1 month before the diagnosis of BPPV. In contrast, only 5.5% of the controls had undergone dental treatment within 1 month before the date at which they were identified (P = 0.001). After adjustments for demographic factors and comorbidities, recent exposure to dental procedures was positively associated with BPPV (adjusted odds ratio 1.77; 95% confidence interval 1.27–2.47). This association was still significant if we expanded the time period from 1 month to 3 months (adjusted odds ratio 1.77; 95% confidence interval 1.39–2.26). Conclusions Our results demonstrated a correlation between dental procedures and BPPV. The specialists who treat patients with BPPV should consider dental procedures to be a risk factor, and dentists should recognize BPPV as a possible complication of dental treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2326199080,"Ion channels are a class of membrane proteins that attracts a significant amount of basic research, also being potential drug targets. High-throughput identification of these channels is hampered by the low levels of availability of their structures and an observation that use of sequence similarity offers limited predictive quality. Consequently, several machine learning predictors of ion channels from protein sequences that do not rely on high sequence similarity were developed. However, only one of these methods offers a wide scope by predicting ion channels, their types and four major subtypes of the voltage-gated channels. Moreover, this and other existing predictors utilize relatively simple predictive models that limit their accuracy. We propose a novel and accurate predictor of ion channels, their types and the four subtypes of the voltage-gated channels called PSIONplus. Our method combines a support vector machine model and a sequence similarity search with BLAST. The originality of PSIONplus stems from the use of a more sophisticated machine learning model that for the first time in this area utilizes evolutionary profiles and predicted secondary structure, solvent accessibility and intrinsic disorder. We empirically demonstrate that the evolutionary profiles provide the strongest predictive input among new and previously used input types. We also show that all new types of inputs contribute to the prediction. Results on an independent test dataset reveal that PSIONplus obtains relatively good predictive performance and outperforms existing methods. It secures accuracies of 85.4% and 68.3% for the prediction of ion channels and their types, respectively, and the average accuracy of 96.4% for the discrimination of the four ion channel subtypes. Standalone version of PSIONplus is freely available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/psion/"
https://openalex.org/W2326057587,"Background In both observational and randomized studies, associations with overall survival are by and large assessed on a multiplicative scale using the Cox model. However, clinicians and clinical researchers have an ardent interest in assessing absolute benefit associated with treatments. In older patients, some studies have reported lower relative treatment effect, which might translate into similar or even greater absolute treatment effect given their high baseline hazard for clinical events. Methods The effect of treatment and the effect modification of treatment were respectively assessed using a multiplicative and an additive hazard model in an analysis adjusted for propensity score in the context of coronary surgery. Results The multiplicative model yielded a lower relative hazard reduction with bilateral internal thoracic artery grafting in older patients (Hazard ratio for interaction/year = 1.03, 95%CI: 1.00 to 1.06, p = 0.05) whereas the additive model reported a similar absolute hazard reduction with increasing age (Delta for interaction/year = 0.10, 95%CI: -0.27 to 0.46, p = 0.61). The number needed to treat derived from the propensity score-adjusted multiplicative model was remarkably similar at the end of the follow-up in patients aged < = 60 and in patients >70. Conclusions The present example demonstrates that a lower treatment effect in older patients on a relative scale can conversely translate into a similar treatment effect on an additive scale due to large baseline hazard differences. Importantly, absolute risk reduction, either crude or adjusted, can be calculated from multiplicative survival models. We advocate for a wider use of the absolute scale, especially using additive hazard models, to assess treatment effect and treatment effect modification."
https://openalex.org/W2341683472,"Background The incidence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) is increasing rapidly. Many authors feel that this increase is due to over-diagnosis and that one of the contributing factors is the increasing use of various imaging studies. The rate of obesity has also been increasing in the United States. It has been suggested that patients with an increased body mass index (BMI kg/m2) have a higher incidence of WDTC than patients with normal BMI. One might hypothesize that thyroid nodules are more difficult to palpate in obese patients and that as more cancers are detected by imaging the apparent rate of increase in WDTC in obese patients would appear to be greater than in non-obese patients. This study was undertaken to evaluate this hypothesis by determining if there is any difference in the way thyroid cancers are initially detected in obese and non-obese patients. Methods The medical records of all 519 patients with a postoperative diagnosis of WDTC who underwent thyroidectomy at NYU Langone Medical Center from January 1, 2007 through August 31, 2010 by the three members of NYU Endocrine Surgery Associates were reviewed. Patients were divided into Non-obese (BMI<30 kg/m2) and Obese (BMI≥30 kg/m2) groups. Patients were also divided by the initial method of detection of their tumor into Palpation, Imaging, and Incidental groups. Results The final study group contained 270 patients, 181(67%) of whom were in the Non-obese Group and 89(33%) were in the Obese Group. In the Non-obese group, 81(45%) of tumors were found by palpation, 72(40%) were found by imaging, and 28(16%) were found incidentally. In the Obese group, 40(45%) were found by palpation, 38(43%) were found by imaging, and 11(12%) were found incidentally. These differences were not statistically significant (p-value 0.769). Conclusion We show that BMI does not play a role in the method of initial detection in patients with WDTC. This suggests that the prevalence of WDTC detected by imaging is not an artifact caused by an increasingly obese population and that any association of WDTC and obesity is not related to the way in which these tumors are detected."
https://openalex.org/W2341925889,"Dust storm has serious disastrous impacts on environment, human health, and assets. The developments and applications of dust storm models have contributed significantly to better understand and predict the distribution, intensity and structure of dust storms. However, dust storm simulation is a data and computing intensive process. To improve the computing performance, high performance computing has been widely adopted by dividing the entire study area into multiple subdomains and allocating each subdomain on different computing nodes in a parallel fashion. Inappropriate allocation may introduce imbalanced task loads and unnecessary communications among computing nodes. Therefore, allocation is a key factor that may impact the efficiency of parallel process. An allocation algorithm is expected to consider the computing cost and communication cost for each computing node to minimize total execution time and reduce overall communication cost for the entire simulation. This research introduces three algorithms to optimize the allocation by considering the spatial and communicational constraints: 1) an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based algorithm from combinational optimization perspective; 2) a K-Means and Kernighan-Lin combined heuristic algorithm (K&K) integrating geometric and coordinate-free methods by merging local and global partitioning; 3) an automatic seeded region growing based geometric and local partitioning algorithm (ASRG). The performance and effectiveness of the three algorithms are compared based on different factors. Further, we adopt the K&K algorithm as the demonstrated algorithm for the experiment of dust model simulation with the non-hydrostatic mesoscale model (NMM-dust) and compared the performance with the MPI default sequential allocation. The results demonstrate that K&K method significantly improves the simulation performance with better subdomain allocation. This method can also be adopted for other relevant atmospheric and numerical modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2336317475,"Although serotonin is known to play an important role in pain processing, the relationship between the polymorphism in 5-HTTLPR and pain processing is not well understood. To examine the relationship more comprehensively, various factors of pain processing having putative associations with 5-HT functioning were studied, namely the subjective pain experience (pain threshold, rating of experimental pain), catastrophizing about pain (Pain Catastrophizing Scale = PCS) and motor responsiveness (facial expression of pain). In 60 female and 67 male participants, heat pain stimuli were applied by a contact thermode to assess pain thresholds, supra-threshold ratings and a composite score of pain-relevant facial responses. Participants also completed the PCS and were grouped based on their 5-HTTLPR genotype (bi-allelic evaluation) into a group with s-allele carriers (ss, sl) and a second group without (ll). S-allele carriers proved to have lower pain thresholds and higher PCS scores. These two positive findings were unrelated to each other. No other difference between genotype groups became significant. In all analyses, ""age"" and ""gender"" were controlled for. In s-allele carriers the subjective pain experience and the tendency to catastrophize about pain was enhanced, suggesting that the s-allele might be a risk factor for the development and maintenance of pain. This risk factor seems to act via two independent routes, namely via the sensory processes of subjective pain experiences and via the booster effects of pain catastrophizing."
https://openalex.org/W2415612875,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with loss of dopaminergic neurons of the brain, which results in insufficient synthesis and action of dopamine. Metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) is an upstream modulator of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis, and hence MTA1 plays a significant role in PD pathogenesis. To impart functional and clinical significance to MTA1, we analyzed MTA1 and TH levels in the substantia nigra region of a large cohort of human brain tissue samples by Western blotting, quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that MTA1 and TH levels were significantly down-regulated in PD samples as compared with normal brain tissue. Correspondingly, immunohistochemistry analysis for MTA1 in substantia nigra sections revealed that 74.1% of the samples had a staining intensity of <6 in the PD samples as compared with controls, 25.9%, with an odds ratio of 8.54. Because of the clinical importance of MTA1 established in PD, we looked at agents to modulate MTA1 expression in neuronal cells, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was chosen, due to its clinically proven neurogenic effects. Treatment of the human neuronal cell line KELLY and acute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model with G-CSF showed significant induction of MTA1 and TH with rescue of phenotype in the mouse model. Interestingly, the observed induction of TH was compromised on silencing of MTA1. The underlying molecular mechanism of MTA1 induction by G-CSF was proved to be through induction of c-Fos and its recruitment to the MTA1 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2338749781,"Given that the elevated serum semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) activity is associated with the severity of carotid atherosclerosis in clinic, the current study aims to investigate whether SSAO inactivation by semicarbazide is beneficial for established atherosclerotic lesions in LDLr knockout mice on a high-fat/high- cholesterol Western-type diet or after dietary lipid lowering. Despite no impact on plasma total cholesterol levels, the infiltration of circulating monocytes into peripheral tissues, and the size of atherosclerotic lesions, abrogation of SSAO activity resulted in the stabilization of established lesions as evidenced by the increased collagen contents under both conditions. Moreover, SSAO inactivation decreased Ly6Chigh monocytosis and lesion macrophage contents in hypercholesterolemic mice, while no effect was observed in mice after normalization of hypercholesterolemia by dietary lipid lowering. Strikingly, abrogation of SSAO activity significantly increased not only the absolute numbers of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), but also the percent of SMCs with a synthetic phenotype in established lesions of mice regardless of plasma cholesterol levels. Overall, our data indicate that SSAO inactivation in vivo stabilizes the established plaques mainly via inducing the switch of SMCs from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype. Targeting SSAO activity thus may represent a potential treatment for patients with atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2340224580,"Glutamate transporters actively take up glutamate into the cell, driven by the co-transport of sodium ions down their transmembrane concentration gradient. It was proposed that glutamate binds to its binding site and is subsequently transported across the membrane in the negatively charged form. With the glutamate binding site being located partially within the membrane domain, the possibility has to be considered that glutamate binding is dependent on the transmembrane potential and, thus, is electrogenic. Experiments presented in this report test this possibility. Rapid application of glutamate to the wild-type glutamate transporter subtype EAAC1 (excitatory amino acid carrier 1) through photo-release from caged glutamate generated a transient inward current, as expected for the electrogenic inward movement of co-transported Na+. In contrast, glutamate application to a transporter with the mutation A334E induced transient outward current, consistent with movement of negatively charged glutamate into its binding site within the dielectric of the membrane. These results are in agreement with electrostatic calculations, predicting a valence for glutamate binding of −0.27. Control experiments further validate and rule out other possible explanations for the transient outward current. Electrogenic glutamate binding can be isolated in the mutant glutamate transporter because reactions, such as glutamate translocation and/or Na+ binding to the glutamate-bound state, are inhibited by the A334E substitution. Electrogenic glutamate binding has to be considered together with other voltage-dependent partial reactions to cooperatively determine the voltage dependence of steady-state glutamate uptake and glutamate buffering at the synapse.

Several reports have indicated that glutamate is transported in its negatively charged form, in which its carboxyl side chain is deprotonated (13Watzke N. Rauen T. Bamberg E. Grewer C.

Interaction of l-cysteine with a human excitatory amino acid transporter.J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The main evidence comes from mutagenesis studies, implying a conserved arginine residue in the binding site, Arg-446 (EAAC1 sequence numbering) in the formation of a salt bridge with the γ-carboxylate of the glutamate substrate bound to the transporter (15Bendahan A. Armon A. Madani N. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Arginine 447 plays a pivotal role in substrate interactions in a neuronal glutamate transporter.J. Biol.

This idea was confirmed by the structure of the archeal glutamate transporter homologue GltPh (16Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Structure of a glutamate transporter homologue from Pyrococcus horikoshii.Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In this structure, the bound substrate, aspartate, is located in a binding site that is protected from the extracellular side of the membrane by hairpin loop 2 (HP2), 3The abbreviations used are: HPhairpin loopSCN−thiocyanate anionTBOAdl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartic acidMNImethoxynitroindolineMDmolecular dynamics. thus locking the substrate into the binding site. Access to the binding site appears to only be possible when HP2 opens, allowing the substrate to bind and/or dissociate (16Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E.

However, to date, no experimental evidence for electrogenic substrate binding has been obtained. hairpin loop thiocyanate anion dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartic acid methoxynitroindoline molecular dynamics. In this report, we provide results from a mutant glutamate transporter, in which substrate translocation and/or Na+ binding to the glutamate-bound form is slowed down but still allows for glutamate binding. The mutated amino acid residue, A334E, is located at the tip of HP1 (Fig. 1A), which was previously implied to act as the internal gate (16Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Structure of a glutamate transporter homologue from Pyrococcus horikoshii.Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and is also important in Na+ coordination. The mutation was originally designed to test structural changes involving HP1 during translocation, by engineering charge movement through the introduction of negative charge. However, our results suggest that the charge-altering mutation electrostatically interferes with structural changes and sodium binding to the glutamate-bound transporter, allowing us to isolate substrate binding, and steps associated with it, along the time axis. We demonstrate outward charge movement upon rapid glutamate application to the A334E mutant transporter, which is consistent with an electrogenic glutamate binding step and/or structural changes induced by glutamate binding. The experimental results are compared with computational analysis of the electrostatics of glutamate binding/HP2 closure, which also suggest that binding is voltage-dependent. Kinetic and structural models are proposed to explain the data and to exclude other possible mechanisms of glutamate-induced outward currents. HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection number 1573) were cultured as described previously (6Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. Early intermediates in the transport cycle of the neuronal excitatory amino acid carrier EAAC1.J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cell cultures were transiently transfected with EAAC1 cDNA inserted into a pBK-CMV-expression plasmid by use of JETPRIME transfection reagent, following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The cells were then used for electrophysiological measurements 24 h after transfection. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange method, as detailed in the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). Whole-cell currents from EAAC1-expressing cells were recorded using an Adams & List EPC7 amplifier under voltage clamp conditions (17Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Improved patch-clamp techniques for high-resolution current recording from cells and cell-free membrane patches.Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar). The typical resistance of the recording electrode was 2–3 megaohms; the series resistance was 5–8 megaohms. For recordings performed under steady-state conditions, the glutamate-induced currents were small (typically <500 pA). Therefore, series resistance was not compensated. For voltage jump experiments, series resistance compensation of 40–50% was applied in order to accelerate the capacitive charging of the membrane in response to the changes of the membrane potential (18Mwaura J. Tao Z. James H. Albers T. Schwartz A. Grewer C. Protonation state of a conserved acidic amino acid involved in Na+ binding to the glutamate transporter EAAC1.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2012; 3: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All currents were low pass-filtered at 1–10 kHz (KROHN-Hite 3200) and digitized with a digitizer board (Axon, Digidata 1200) at a sampling rate of 10–50 kHz, which was controlled by software (Axon PClamp). The experiments were carried out at room temperature and physiological pH. The rapid solution exchange experiments were carried out as described previously (19Grewer C.

Substrates were applied to the EAAC1(A334E)-expressing cell through a quartz tube with an opening of about 350 μm that was positioned ∼5 mm from the cell. The linear flow rate of the solutions emerging from the tube was about 5–10 cm/s, resulting in typical rise times of the whole-cell current of 30–50 ms. To test anion-conducting properties, SCN− was used because it enhances glutamate transporter-associated currents (5Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Ion fluxes associated with excitatory amino acid transport.Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The presence of permeating anions like SCN− has previously been shown to permanently activate an anion current under homoexchange conditions (6Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. Early intermediates in the transport cycle of the neuronal excitatory amino acid carrier EAAC1.J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The anion current was useful in studying this transporter because the A334E mutation interferes with steady-state glutamate transport. To investigate the glutamate concentration-response relationship of the mutant transporter at steady-state conditions, the pipette solution contained 500 μm glutamate, 120 mm NaSCN, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.4). The extracellular solution contained varying concentrations of up to 500 μm glutamate, 140 mm NaMES, 2 mm CaMES, 2 mm MgMES, 10 mm HEPES (adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.4). These same conditions were used to test the effect of the mutation on the anion current of the transporter using voltage jump protocols as specified under “Voltage Jumps.” Nonspecific currents in the presence of a 200 μm concentration of the non-transportable competitive inhibitor dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA) (20Shimamoto K.

To study the effect of the A334E mutation on the coupled transport current of the transporter, the pipette solution contained 140 mm KMES, and the extracellular solution contained 500 μm glutamate, 140 mm NaMES, 2 mm CaMES2, 2 mm MgMES2, 10 mm HEPES (adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.4) with and without 200 μm TBOA. To select cells with transporter-mediated anion conductance, 140 mm NaSCN was used in place of NaMES because the transporter activity of the mutant is almost negligible. The transporter activity was also investigated under the Na+/glutamate homoexchange conditions; the pipette solution contained 500 μm glutamate, 140 mm NaMES, 2 mm CaMES2, 2 mm MgMES2, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.4), whereas the extracellular solution contained 500 μm glutamate, 2 mm MgMES2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.4) with and without 200 μm TBOA. An extracellular solution containing 140 mm NaMES in place of 140 mm NaSCN was used to test for transporter activity. The Na+/glutamate homoexchange mode makes use of the saturation of the Na+ and glutamate binding sites both intra- and extracellularly, making the potassium binding sites inaccessible; therefore, it is not associated with steady-state transport current. Voltage command pulses in 20-mV increments were 20 ms in duration from −100 to +80 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV. Because most cell systems contain intrinsic, voltage-sensitive channels, transporters, or pumps that lead to nonspecific transient currents, TBOA, a non-transportable transporter inhibitor, was used to detect specific transient currents induced by change in membrane potential (6Watzke N.

Laser pulse photolysis experiments were performed as described previously (6Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C.

Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). 4-Methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl (MNI)-caged glutamate (TOCRIS) was applied to the cells using a small quartz tube and photolyzed with a light flash (355 nm Nd:YAG laser, Minilite series, Continuum, Santa Clara, CA) delivered through an optical fiber (350-μm diameter). The MNI-caged glutamate solutions were freshly prepared before starting each experiment. The yield from the photolysis of 1 mm MNI-caged glutamate was calibrated to release 200 μm free glutamate for the maximum laser energy, according to the procedure described previously (22Grewer C.

Neutral density filters were applied to adjust the laser energy and attenuate glutamate release. Before and after laser-pulse photolysis experiments, a standard glutamate concentration of 100 μm was applied to the cell by solution exchange to determine the concentration of glutamate released with the laser flash. After photolytic glutamate release, the steady-state current amplitude was compared with the steady-state current amplitude from the calibration experiment (100 μm glutamate) and the known concentration-response curve, yielding the released concentration. MNI-caged alanine was kindly provided by Dr. John Corrie and prepared as described previously (11Zhang Z. Papageorgiou G. Corrie J.E. Grewer C.

The non-linear regression fits of the experimental data were performed using Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) or Clampfit (pClamp8 software, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA).

Here, ɛ is the dielectric constant, which depends on the spatial coordinate, ϕ = eΦ/kbT, where Φ is the electrostatic potential, e is the elementary charge, T is the temperature, and kb is the Boltzmann constant. κ is the Debye-Hückel screening constant, and ρ is the charge density. f(r) is the Heaviside step function, set to 1 in the intracellular solution and 0 in the membrane, protein, and extracellular solution. The total electrostatic energy, E, is then computed by summing up over the product of the local charge and the potential (28Silva J.R. Pan H. Wu D. Nekouzadeh A. Decker K.F. Cui J. Baker N.A. Sept D.

The total system contained 146,859 atoms. The system was equilibrated for 4 ns at a constant pressure of 1 atm and a constant temperature of 310 K, using Langevin dynamics. For the following production runs, we used NVT conditions (constant number of particles, volume, and temperature (canonical ensemble)). The cut-off for short range interactions was 12 Å. For electrostatic interactions, we used the particle mesh Ewald method (31Darden T. York D.M. Pdersen L. Particle mesh Ewald: an N log(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems.J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20829) Google Scholar) implemented in NAMD. Bonds, including hydrogen atoms and TIP3P water, were kept rigid using SHAKE. The time step of the simulations was 2 fs (NAMD) or 4 fs (ACEMD (32Harvey M.J. Giupponi G. Fabritiis G.D. ACEMD: accelerating biomolecular dynamics in the microsecond time scale.J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2009; 5: 1632-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar)). All simulations were performed using the CHARMM27 force field (33MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T.K. Mattos C. et al.All-atom empirical potential for molecular modeling and dynamics studies of proteins.J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11686) Google Scholar). The functionality of the mutant glutamate transporter was assessed by following relaxation of currents in response to rapid application of the transported substrate, glutamate. Glutamate was applied by photolysis of caged glutamate (release time constant of 200 ns (34Maier W. Corrie J.E. Papageorgiou G. Laube B. Grewer C. Comparative analysis of inhibitory effects of caged ligands for the NMDA receptor.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; 142: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)), providing a time resolution in the 100 μs time range. After photolytic release, glutamate binds to the transporter, and the subsequent transporter reaction steps are synchronized in time, providing time-resolved information on the charge movement associated with these steps. As shown in Fig. 1B, glutamate concentration jumps elicited outward transient current in EAAC1(A334E). This current was not observed in the presence of TBOA, a competitive glutamate transporter blocker, and in the absence of caged glutamate (Fig. 1B, bottom), showing that the transient current is specifically carried by the glutamate transporter. The outward current decayed with a single-exponential component with a time constant of 0.8 ± 0.02 ms at [Glu] of 100 μm. The outward transient current can be caused by the inward movement of negative charge (Fig. 1E) and/or the outward movement of a positive charge. In contrast, rapid glutamate application induced transient inward current in EAAC1(WT) (Fig. 1C) due to the inward movement of positive charge. It was previously suggested that this inward transient current in the wild-type transporter, which displays rising and decaying phases, is caused by the following molecular events following glutamate release (6Watzke N.

Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35Grewer C. Watzke N. Wiessner M. Rauen T.

Isolation of current components and partial reaction cycles in the glial glutamate transporter EAAT2.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2749-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): 1) rapid rise of the current due to diffusion-controlled glutamate binding and 2) biexponential decay of the current caused by the binding of Na+ to the empty transporter, electrogenic glutamate translocation across the membrane, and electrogenic Na+ binding to the glutamate-bound form of the transporter and/or a conformational change associated with this binding. All of these events cause the movement of positive charge deeper into the transmembrane electric field until a new steady state is reached, thus generating inward transient current. A typical trace is shown in Fig. 1C, and average currents are shown in Fig. 1D. The glutamate concentration dependence of the relaxation rate constant, 1/τ, of the decaying phase of the current is shown in Fig. 1F, allowing insights into the molecular basis underlying the transient outward current. At low concentrations, the 1/τ versus [Glu] relationship is linear. Such a linear concentration dependence is expected for a diffusion-controlled substrate binding reaction with a bimolecular rate coefficient of 2 × 107 m−1 s−1 (Fig. 1F, dashed line), as proposed previously for EAAC1(WT) and other subtypes (35Grewer C. Watzke N. Wiessner M. Rauen T. Glutamate translocation of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 occurs within milliseconds.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9706-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 37Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. Macroscopic and microscopic properties of a cloned glutamate transporter/chloride channel.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, at high [Glu], deviation from linearity is observed, with 1/τ leveling off (Fig. 1F, solid line), indicating that glutamate binding is not rate-limiting under these conditions. Leveling off is expected if a reaction other than binding (e.g. a conformational change) follows the rapid substrate binding process. The voltage dependence of the relaxation rate constant for the rising and decaying phases of the outward transient current is shown in Fig. 1G. The rate constant associated with the decay"
https://openalex.org/W2339002877,"An abattoir survey was performed in the French Melanesian archipelago of New Caledonia to determine the prevalence of paramphistomes in cattle and deer and to generate material for molecular typing at species and subspecies level. Prevalence in adult cattle was high at animal level (70% of 387 adult cattle) and batch level (81%). Prevalence was lower in calves at both levels (33% of 484 calves, 51% at batch level). Animals from 2 of 7 deer farms were positive for rumen fluke, with animal-level prevalence of 41.4% (29/70) and 47.1% (33/70), respectively. Using ITS-2 sequencing, 3 species of paramphistomes were identified, i.e. Calicophoron calicophorum, Fischoederius elongatus and Orthocoelium streptocoelium. All three species were detected in cattle as well as deer, suggesting the possibility of rumen fluke transmission between the two host species. Based on heterogeneity in ITS-2 sequences, the C. calicophorum population comprises two clades, both of which occur in cattle as well as deer. The results suggest two distinct routes of rumen fluke introduction into this area. This approach has wider applicability for investigations of the origin of rumen fluke infections and for the possibility of parasite transmission at the livestock-wildlife interface."
https://openalex.org/W2315374864,"Pediatric renal osteodystrophy (ROD) is characterized by changes in bone turnover, mineralization, and volume that are brought about by alterations in bone resorption and formation. The resorptive and formative surfaces on the cancellous bone are separated from the marrow cavity by canopies consisting of a layer of flat osteoblastic cells. These canopies have been suggested to play a key role in the recruitment of osteoprogenitors during the process of bone remodeling. This study was performed to address the characteristics of the canopies above bone formation and resorption sites and their association with biochemical and bone histomorphometric parameters in 106 pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients (stage 2–5) across the spectrum of ROD. Canopies in CKD patients often appeared as thickened multilayered canopies, similar to previous reports in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. This finding contrasts with the thin appearance reported in healthy individuals with normal kidney function. Furthermore, canopies in pediatric CKD patients showed immunoreactivity to the PTH receptor (PTHR1) as well as to the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL). The number of surfaces with visible canopy coverage was associated with plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, bone formation rate, and the extent of remodeling surfaces. Collectively, these data support the conclusion that canopies respond to the elevated PTH levels in CKD and that they possess the molecular machinery necessary to respond to PTH signaling."
