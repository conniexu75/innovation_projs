https://openalex.org/W2065343501,The time required to recognize that two perspective drawings portray objects of the same three-dimensional shape is found to be (i) a linearly increasing function of the angular difference in the portrayed orientations of the two objects and (ii) no shorter for differences corresponding simply to a rigid rotation of one of the two-dimensional drawings in its own picture plane than for differences corresponding to a rotation of the three-dimensional object in depth.
https://openalex.org/W2121684702,"Twenty-four infants ranging in age from 2 to 11 weeks responded to symmetrically expanding shadows, which optically specify an approaching object, with an integrated avoidance response and upset. This response did not occur for asymmetrically expanding shadows nor for contracting shadows that specify an object on a miss path and a receding object. The response was observed in all the infants regardless of age, and the addition of kinetic depth information to the displays did not increase the intensity or likelihood of the response. In a second experiment, seven infants defensively reacted to the approach of a real object except when it was on a miss path."

In contrast to the rat, quail also learn to avoid water that is merely darkened by vegetable dye. The visual cue is even more salient than the taste cue in quail."

Corrected emission and excitation spectra are presented and compared with low-temperature data. The quantum yields are, respectively, 2.6 × 10 -4 , 3.0 × 10 -4 , 0.8 × 10 -4 , and 0.5 × 10 -4 when the bases are excited at their low-energy absorption maxima."
https://openalex.org/W2435295041,"In spite of the considerable progress made in recent years toward the understanding of the chemistry and biological function of the cobalt-containing B(12) group of compounds, much of the information still is more descriptive than definitive in nature. In general terms, it is known that the free vitamin forms can function as methyl group carriers and that the 5'-deoxyadenosyl or coenzyme forms serve as hydrogen carriers; but the mechanism of these processes is not understood in detail. More systematic studies of the pure chemistry of these complex molecules containing a carbon-cobalt covalent bond are needed before the biochemist can interpret many of his observations on the enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Even in relatively simple solutions it is difficult to ascertain the state of oxidation of several of the vitamin forms, and these problems are compounded when the reactive thiol compounds and complex proteins of the biological systems also are present. For example, both vitamin B(12r) (the Co(2+) form) and corresponding analogs are known to disproportionate in solution to B(12s) (Co(1+)) and B(12a) (Co(3+)) under a variety of mild conditions (12, 57). This means that in the biological systems it is exceedingly difficult to ascertain the chemical nature of many B(12) intermediates and reaction products. The role of the protein moiety of the various B(12)-linked enzymes in the catalytic processes is little known as is, also, the mode of binding of the B(12) derivative to the protein. These types of questions perhaps can be answered eventually by the crystallographers, whose art is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Note added after preparation of manuscript. In contrast to the values given in Table 4 for the molecular weights of the two dissimilar protein moieties of glycerol dehydrase, a recent report (57a), gives a value of 188,000 for the molecular weight of a stable, catalytically inactive complex of 1 mole of hydroxocobalamin and 1 mole of the apoenzyme complex of glycerol dehydrase. The latter is presumed to contain one equivalent of each of the two dissimilar protein subunits. The original estimate of 240,000 as the molecular weight of the unstable sulfhydryl protein moiety (39) was undoubtedly made on partially aggregated material."
https://openalex.org/W1967299354,Laser radiation at 488 nanometers selectively stimulates neurons in the abdominal ganglion of the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. The laser radiation can be scanned over the surface of the ganglion and can be effectively utilized in mapping cellular interconnections. The laser appears to cause these changes through some mechanism other than damage.
https://openalex.org/W2064208983,"Embryonic tissue cells dissociated with ethylenediaminetetraacetate are readily agglutinated by the carbohydrate-binding protein concanavalin A. In this property, they resemble transformed, neoplastic cells; and they differ from untransformed adult cells, which are agglutinated by concanavalin A only after their receptors are unmasked by proteolytic treatment. Receptor sites for wheat germ agglutinin are also present on the surface of embryonic cells, but in a masked form, as on untransformed adult culture cells; they can be unmasked by treatment of the cells with trypsin. Concanavalin A binding sites on embryonic cells may function in cell contact and cell organization during embryonic morphogenesis and differentiation and later become masked in adult cells. The unmasking of these sites in neoplastic cells may represent a return, in this respect, to a condition resembling that of embryonic cells and may be related to cell mobility associated with infiltration and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2017106213,"The template activity of DNA with calf thymus DNA polymerase has been studied in sections of fixed brain, liver, and heart tissues from young and senescent mice. The enzyme catalyzed greater incorporation of deoxyribonucleotide monophosphates into nuclei of old mouse neurons, astrocytes, Kupffer cells, and heart muscle fibers. The results are interpreted as the accumulation of DNA strand breaks with aging."
https://openalex.org/W2068922656,Food materials from the sunken and recovered research submarine Alvin were found to be in a strikingly well-preserved state after exposure for more than 10 months to deep-sea conditions. Subsequent experiments substantiated this observation and indicated that rates of microbial degradation were 10 to 100 times slower in the deep sea than in controls under comparable temperatures.

https://openalex.org/W2054785643,"Preliminary experiments indicate that tunable Pb(1-x)Sn(x)Te diode lasers will be useful in the identification and sensitive detection of most of the atmospheric pollutant gases. For point-sampling applications, concentrations in the parts-per-billion range should be measurable with very high specificity. For long-range atmospheric transmission techniques, the improved resolution capability and tunability of these diode lasers make them attractive replacements for spectrometers and fixed-frequency laser sources where operation at cryogenic temperatures is not a serious impediment. By using these lasers as tunable local oscillators in the infrared heterodyne configuration, remote passive detection of gases present in smokestack effluent appears possible. Finally, pulsed operation at temperatures available with simple cryogenic coolers permits immediate application to the fast detection of gases present in automobile exhaust and in chemical processing plants."
https://openalex.org/W2041788999,"The pigeon's so-called ""arbitrary"" response of pecking an illuminated disk can be established and maintained by procedures resembling those of classical conditioning. This phenomenon was shown to be independent of the specific signaling relationships between illumination of the pecking disk and presentation of food; it will appear as long as the key is differentially associated with food. When a nondifferential condition is introduced, pecking ""extinguishes"" even if it has previously been established and even when the new condition involves as much reinforcement as the old one. Reinstating differential conditions reestablishes pecking. The initial conditions determine the speed and apparently the asymptote of pecking rates in the differential condition; initial exposure to a nondifferential procedure retards subsequent acquisition, possibly quite permanently. These findings are discussed in the context of mechanisms of adaptive learning, not involving reward and punishment, which lead to selection of effective behaviors on a nonarbitrary basis."
https://openalex.org/W2060076550,Echolocating bats Eptesicus fuscus and Phyllostomus hastatus can discriminate between the nearer and farther of two targets. Their errors in discrimination are predicted accurately by the autocorrelation functions of their sonar cries. These bats behave as though they have an ideal sonar system which cross correlates the transmitted cry with the returning echo to extract target-range information.
https://openalex.org/W1992461960,"Electrophysiological recordings show that water is not tasteless to cats. Also, unlike most mammals, cats appear indifferent to sucrose, but this may be because the taste of the sucrose is masked by the taste of the water in which it is dissolved. When the water taste is suppressed by the addition of small amounts of sodium chloride, cats take sucrose avidly."
https://openalex.org/W2084790988,"The calcium ion pump of fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum can be coupled to hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate, in the absence of added adenosine triphosphate. Comparison of the activities obtained with the two substrates suggests an analogous mechanism of transport. Independent of the substrate, a 2 : 1 ratio between calcium ion transport and substrate hydrolysis is displayed by the system, and an identical amount of work is required for ion transport against a given gradient. A phosphate ester appears necessary for substrate utilization in the pump mechanism, whereas the structure of the substrate determines the rates of activity and the affinity of the system for calcium ion."
https://openalex.org/W2013699829,"Test scores predict the college grades of educationally disadvantaged students at least as well as they do those of the advantaged. High school grades considerably augment the prediction for both groups. Regardless of socioeconomic level, students who are predicted to earn quite low grades within a particular college will tend to have academic difficulties if enrolled in it. There are social and educational justifications for admitting to a particular college some minority-group students who are marginally qualified for it academically, provided that the students are given adequate financial aid and effective remedial courses, tutoring, and coaching. However, if entrants are greatly underqualified academically, new curricula will be required. These may tend to segregate the specially admitted students from the regular student body, thereby diminishing the pacesetter role of the latter. Also, a degree from a special curriculum may not be viewed by employers, graduate schools, and alumni as equivalent to the other degrees awarded by the institution. Thus, admitting students who are seriously underqualified academically for the particular college seems likely to cause frustrations that may be difficult to resolve. Current demands by minority groups for ""relevant"" courses may reflect the academic difficulties many of their members encounter in present courses more than the educational unsuitability for them of such courses."
https://openalex.org/W2069187408,"2-Methylheptadecane is a sex pheromone compound in many sibling species of the Holomelina aurantiaca complex, in Holomelina laeta, and in Pyrrharctia isabella, which are all arctiids. Habitat preference, temporal distribution , and differing diurnal cycles help effect reproductive isolation among the species, but secondary sex pheromone chemicals are also suggested by the field studies."
https://openalex.org/W1986956148,"Secondary neurons of the olfactory bulb can be excited monosynaptically after activation of neighboring secondary neurons by antidromic and orthodromic volleys. Recurrent collaterals of secondary neurons are proposed to synapse with other secondary neurons, thus forming a direct recurrent excitatory pathway. Such a positive feedback system could strengthen the original input signal."

The composition of perilymph is unaffected. Perilymph and endolymph are slightly hypertonic as compared to plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1981747881,Penicillin enhances the excitatory postsynaptic potential of the squid stellate ganglion. This effect suggests the hypothesis that the epileptic focus created by the topical application of penicillin to the mammalian cerebral cortex is produced by the facilitation of excitatory synaptic coupling within the preexisting positive recurrent feedback system.
https://openalex.org/W2015667539,Improvements in the argon laser microbeam have made it possible to cause damage to chromosomes of tissue culture cells without prior treatment of the cells with a photosensitizing agent. These results have been confirmed independently in two laboratories.
https://openalex.org/W2085152850,"The rate of ribosomal RNA synthesis per nucleus in cleaving sea urchin embryos is similar to the rate at later embryonic stages. The multiple, atypical nucleoli, present in early embryos and usually attributed to decreased ribosomal RNA synthesis, are beginning stages of nucleolar formation. Full nucleolar development requires more time than the brief interphase of the rapidly dividing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2059261815,"In the catfish retina there are two types of ganglion cells: in one type (type A cell) a spot of light at the center of its receptive field gives rise to a sustained discharge whereas an annulus gives rise to a transient response, and in the other type (type B cell) the response pattern is reversed for a spot and an annulus. Current injected into the horizontal cell induces spike discharges of the ganglion cell very similar to that elicited by a spot of light or by an annulus. In both types of receptive fields, depolarization of the horizontal cell gives rise to a response of the ganglion cell similar to that elicited by a spot of light, whereas hyperpolarization of the cell gives rise to a response of the ganglion cell similar to that elicited by an annulus. Current through a single injecting electrode could drive two types of cells simultaneously. Interaction between a spot of light and an annulus can also be simulated by replacing one light stimulus by current of the proper polarization injected into the horizontal cells. Results suggest that interactions among three neuronal structures, the receptor, the horizontal cell, and the bipolar cell, produce the basic receptive field organization in the channel catfish."

The system is stimulated by both polyuridylate and R17 RNA and is sensitive to inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesizing systems. A comparison is made between this system and that found in the cytoplasm of yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2068045501,"Of six closely related species of budworm moths, three share the same or similar sex pheromones. Two of the others share another sex pheromone, but are geographically isolated. The sixth species, which is the most morphologically distinct, shows only slight affinity to the others."
https://openalex.org/W2076691460,Newborn garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) responded similarly to worm and fish surface extracts regardless of whether the mothers were fed exclusively on fish or worms during the gestation period. Worm extract was the more effective. This result is in contrast with the easy modifiability of chemical-cue preferences in young snakes after birth. The initial stimulus control of the attack response in newborn snakes thus seems relatively unmodifiable.
https://openalex.org/W2049152185,"When eggs and cleaving embryos of the sea urchin are exposed to [(3)H]actinomycin D, they become radioactive, and autoradiograms show that the radioactivity is inside the cells. At midcleavage, nuclei are more radioactive than cytoplasm. Extraction and chromatography of the intracellular labeled compounds identify them as actinomycin D and a water-soluable derivative. Conversion does not take place outside the cells. Treatment of embryos for 90 minutes with actinomycin D inhibits synthesis of RNA by more than 90 percent, leaving unaffected turnover of the pCpCpA terminals in transfer RNA. These data justify earlier interpretations of actinomycin experiments with embryos and justify use of the drug as a tool in the analysis of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1587977270,"Abstract Aerobacter aerogenes produces a capsular polysaccharide composed of tetrasaccharide repeating units containing galactose, mannose, and glucuronic acid in a molar ratio of 2:1:1. Particulate cell envelope fractions of the organism catalyze the incorporation of galactose, mannose, and glucuronic acid from their respective nucleotide derivatives into capsular polysaccharide and into a lipid fraction. Kinetic studies of galactose-14C transfer from UDP-galactose-14C into the lipid fraction and into capsular polysaccharide suggested that a lipid-bound oligosaccharide intermediate is a precursor of the capsular polysaccharide. The biosynthesis of the intermediate oligosaccharide was shown to be initiated by the incorporation of galactose into an endogenous phospholipid. This reaction was characterized as a phosphogalactosyltransferase on the basis of its reversibility by UMP, but not UDP, and the alkali-catalyzed release of cyclic galactose 1,2-phosphate from the intermediate, indicating that galactose is bound to the lipid by a pyrophosphate linkage. The carrier phospholipid was isolated and purified by column chromatography on silicic acid and DEAE-cellulose, and finally, by preparative thin layer chromatography. The pure phospholipid, identified as undecaprenyl phosphate by mass spectrometry, restored the polysaccharide-synthesizing capacity of enzyme preparations which had been depleted of endogenous lipid by treatment with organic solvents. The particulate fraction catalyzes the sequential transfer of mannose, glucuronic acid, and a second galactose moiety to galactosyl-P-P-undecaprenol to form the di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharide derivatives, each of which was isolated and characterized, establishing the following sequence: UDP-Gal + P-lipid ⇌ Gal-P-P-lipid + UMP Gal-P-P-lipid + GDP-Man → Man-Gal-P-P-lipid + (GDP) Man-Gal-P-P-lipid + UDP-GlcUA → GlcUA-Man-Gal-P-P-lipid + (UDP) GlcUA-Man-Gal-P-P-lipid + UDP-Gal → Gal-(GlcUA)-Man-Gal-P-P-lipid + (UDP) The lipid-linked tetrasaccharide is polymerized to form a macromolecular product which is identical with native capsular polysaccharide, based on its composition and its susceptibility to degradation by a specific, phage-induced depolymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2051741818,"Small quantities of unusual hemoglobins were found in 1 of 37 chimpanzees and 2 of 6 gorillas. In each genus these hemoglobins contain unique alpha chains that differ from the ordinary by eight to nine scattered amino acid changes. The unusual chains arise from a hitherto undetected hemoglobin (3)alpha locus. No (3)alpha products are found in most apes; accordingly, (3)alpha is considered synthetically inactive in all but a few reversion mutants. Indirect evidence that the inactive (3)alpha locus is juxtaposed to an active alpha locus together with the supposition that (3)alpha exists in man provides a setting wherein thalassemia might be produced by nonhomologous recombination between two loci."

https://openalex.org/W2080639724,"Exposure to ultraviolet light can reduce the frequency of chromatid breaks induced by cytosine arabinoside in the DNA synthetic and post-DNA synthetic phases of the cell cycle. This effect can be correlated temporally with a decrease in the uptake of tritiated thymidine after ultraviolet treatment, implying that the genesis of such breakage is intimately related to DNA synthesis and that such synthesis is not confined to the DNA synthetic phase."
