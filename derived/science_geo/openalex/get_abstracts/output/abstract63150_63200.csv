https://openalex.org/W1497458285,"The reduction of cytochrome c by xanthine oxidase and the competitive inhibition of this process by carbonic anhydrase and by myoglobin have been studied by kinetic and by equilibrium binding methods. Carbonic anhydrases isolated from bovine and from human erythrocytes differed strikingly in their ability to inhibit competitively the reduction of cytochrome c. The Ks for cytochrome c was a function of the concentration of xanthine oxidase, as were Ki for carbonic anhydrase and Ki for myoglobin, whereas Ks for xanthine was invariant under the same conditions. Binding studies performed by a variety of methods indicated that carbonic anhydrase does not bind to xanthine oxidase. Carbonic anhydrase was found to be a potent inhibitor of the sulfite-oxygen chain reaction initiated either by the reduction of oxygen at an electrode or by xanthine oxidase plus xanthine. The data are consistent with the conclusion that xanthine oxidase, when catalyzing the aerobic oxidation of xanthine, generates an unstable reduced form of oxygen, presumably the superoxide anion, and that this radical is the agent which directly reduces cytochrome c and initiates the sulfite-oxygen chain reaction. Carbonic anhydrase and myoglobin appear to inhibit the reduction of cytochrome c and the initiation of sulfite oxidation by reducing the steady state concentration of the superoxide anion. It is proposed that they accomplish this end by catalyzing the following dismutation reaction: O2·− + O2·− + 2H+ → O2 + H2O2"

https://openalex.org/W2152939667,"When Escherichia coli O111:B4 is exposed briefly to ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) it releases 30 to 50% of its lipopolysaccharide, determined not only by measuring percentage release of colitose, a sugar unique to this polymer, but also by measuring the amount of phenol-extractable lipopolysaccharide remaining with the cell. The fraction released cannot be significantly increased above 50% by several variations in procedure. The high molecular weight material released by EDTA consists of 85 to 90% lipopolysaccharide, 5 to 10% protein, and 5% phospholipid by weight. When compared with lipopolysaccharide obtained by phenol extraction of control cells, this preparation is more immunogenic, and at least as lethal in mice. It yields two fractions on ultracentrifugation. One fraction, containing 40 to 60% of the lipopolysaccharide and most of the protein and lipid, is heterodisperse on ultracentrifugation but changes to a single symmetrical peak with a sedimentation constant of approximately 11 S when the phospholipid is extracted. Its composition is the same as that of control lipopolysaccharide obtained by phenol extraction of normal cells of this strain. The second fraction contains 30 to 40% of the released lipopolysaccharide and yields on ultracentrifugation a hyper-sharp peak with a sedimentation constant of approximately 5.5 S at infinite dilution. Per mole of heptose this fraction is twice as rich in glucose and galactose, and 4 times as rich in colitose, as control lipopolysaccharide. EDTA treatment also releases lipopolysaccharide from two other strains of E. coli and two species of Salmonella."
https://openalex.org/W1655599718,"Abstract A solubilized preparation from pigeon liver microsomes produced four species of phosphatidate when incubated with a mixture of linoleoyl- and stearoyl-CoA and sn-glycero-3-phosphate. The appearance of distearoyl (15%) and dilinoleoyl (42%) species indicates that either acid may acylate both positions 1 and 2. 1-Stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-glycero-3-phosphate (21%) was no more abundant than 1-linoleoyl-2-stearoylglycero-3-phosphate (22%), indicating that the cell-free system was not selective in esterifying these two acids. Slices of rat liver provided results in marked contrast to those above in that small amounts (1%) of disaturated phosphatidates were produced, and essentially none (3%) of the acids at position 2 was saturated. The major species produced by the slices were predominantly (75%) monoene and diene types formed by the esterification of oleate and linoleate, respectively, at position 2 with saturated acids at position 1. Choline and ethanolamine phosphoglycerides also contained disproportionately greater amounts of newly synthesized, radioactive diene species than would be expected from the endogenous abundance of these types. Endogenous species of diacylglycerophosphorylethanolamine include monoene (2%), diene (19%), tetraene (48%), and hexaene (19%), whereas the isotopic content of the newly synthesized species was approximately 14, 28, 19, and 20%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1651345588,"Abstract The proteolytic enzyme, clostridiopeptidase B (clostripain), from Clostridium histolyticum culture filtrates has been purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by ultracentrifugation, electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels, immunodiffusion, and immunoelectrophoresis. The enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 50,000 from sedimentation equilibrium studies. Optical rotatory dispersion studies suggest a low α-helical content. Clostridiopeptidase B exhibits proteolytic as well as amidase-esterase properties. The specificity is confined primarily to arginine residues, although hydrolysis proceeds to a minor degree in most lysine-containing substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2145340452,"Abstract A leucine-binding protein isolated from Escherichia coli K12 has been purified by DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite cellulose chromatography and its chemical and physical properties were determined. The purified protein was crystallized by adding 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. The crystalline protein was homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, and immunodiffusion. A molecular weight of 24,000 (ultracentrifugation), 36,000 (gel filtration), and 34,000 (amino acid analysis) was obtained. Amino acid analyses showed a low content of sulfur-containing amino acids. This protein proved to be heat-stable and could be reversibly denatured by urea. A large number of analogues were tested and showed that the binding was highly specific for the l isomers of the branched chain amino acids. The constants for the dissociation of the amino acid-protein complexes were less than 1.0 µm. The binding activity was not greatly affected either by changes in pH or ionic strength. Antiserum inhibited binding activity of the protein but had no effect on transport in whole cells. The synthesis of leucine-binding protein and the transport of branched chain amino acids were repressed in cells grown on leucine."
https://openalex.org/W1552756841,"Abstract In Bacillus subtilis a series of four enzymes is responsible for the degradation of l-histidine to ammonia, formamide, and l-glutamic acid. The third enzyme of the series was not investigated; the other three enzymes, histidase, urocanase, and formiminoglutamate hydrolase, are induced by l-histidine and repressed by catabolites. Mutants can be found in which the three enzymes are constitutive but still subject to catabolite repression. In other mutants the three enzymes are insensitive to catabolite repression but still inducible. In addition, a mutant simultaneously constitutive and resistant to catabolite repression and a mutant incapable of producing any one of the three enzymes were found. Other mutants are deficient only in histidase or only in formiminoglutamate hydrolase. The arrangement of the genes affecting the formation of these enzymes was studied by transformation. All genes are closely linked in the order: catabolite repression-inducibility-histidase-formiminoglutamate hydrolase. The mutation causing both constitutivity and insensitivity to catabolite repression may be a deletion. The site whose mutation causes inability to produce any one of the enzymes is very closely linked or allelic to the gene determining response to catabolite repression."
https://openalex.org/W2249523505,"Abstract Evidence for the production of circulating β-lipoprotein and endogenous triglycerides by the intestine was obtained from an examination of intestinal lymph in control rats and in rats fed orotic acid as 2% of the diet. The lipoproteins in lymph were characterized by immunochemical methods, electrophoresis, preparative ultracentrifugation, and lipid analysis. In control rats on a fat-free diet, intestinal lymph contained higher concentrations of β-lipoprotein and triglycerides than did plasma, whereas the lymph concentration of α-lipoprotein was lower than in plasma. In rats fed orotic acid the intestinal lymph content of β-lipoprotein and triglycerides was as high as in the controls, although the plasma concentrations of both β-lipoprotein and triglycerides were less than 5% of normal. In control as well as in orotic acid-fed rats, all intestinal lymph β-lipoprotein and 95% of lymph total fatty acids were recovered in a very low density lipoprotein fraction (density less than 1.006 g per ml) with pre-β electrophoretic mobility. α-Lipoprotein was found in the fraction of density greater than 1.006 g per ml and in the very low density lipoprotein after partial delipidation. Data from the present experiments and earlier experiments with Triton WR-1339 indicate that on a fat-free diet approximately 10% of the plasma triglyceride is derived from the intestine and reaches the blood via lymph in association with very low density lipoprotein. Chylomicrons appeared in the lymph of orotic acid-fed as well as control rats following a fat meal. Previous work has shown that the livers of orotic acid-fed rats are unable to produce β-lipoprotein or to release triglycerides into the circulation. Thus when β-lipoprotein is produced by the intestine but not by the liver, normal transport of exogenous as well as endogenous triglycerides is observed from the intestine into lymph but not from the liver into blood."
https://openalex.org/W1598893347,"The multiple forms of lactate dehydrogenase that occur in trout were partially purified and examined by physical, catalytic, and immunological methods. Two major groups of isoenzymes were detected, which we refer to as the heart and muscle groups. Upon starch gel electrophoresis at pH 6, extracts prepared from white skeletal muscle gave rise to five closely spaced bands of lactate dehydrogenase activity with low mobility. Heart extracts exhibited another group of five (or, in some individuals, nine) closely spaced isoenzymes, which migrated rapidly toward the anode. Liver extracts contained predominantly one isoenzyme corresponding in mobility to one of the heart isoenzymes. When the lactate dehydrogenases of different species (brook, brown, and rainbow trout) were compared, differences were observed in the spacing between individual isoenzymes within the heart and muscle groups. In addition, the mobilities of the isoenzyme groups differed from species to species. To determine whether the trout heart and muscle groups are homologous with the heart and muscle lactate dehydrogenases of higher vertebrates, a comparison was made with crystalline preparations of the pure H4 (heart) and M4 (muscle) homotetramers obtained from the chicken. The two isoenzyme groups of trout were similar in molecular size to the chicken enzymes, as judged by gel filtration experiments with a calibrated column of Sephadex G-200. The heart group, like the chicken H4 enzyme, survived heating at 65°, whereas the chicken M4 enzyme and the trout muscle group were inactivated rapidly by heating at 55°. The trout heart group was more susceptible to inhibition by pyruvate than the muscle group, a difference which is similar in magnitude and direction to that known to exist between the chicken H4 and M4 enzymes. Finally, the trout heart and muscle groups were tested for reactivity with specific antisera prepared in rabbits. Antisera prepared against the chicken H4 enzyme reacted with the trout heart group but not with the trout muscle isoenzymes. The reactions were detected by immunodiffusion, enzyme inhibition, and micro-complement fixation tests. Similarly, antisera prepared against the chicken M4 enzyme reacted with the trout muscle lactate dehydrogenases but not with the trout heart enzymes. Thus, by physical, catalytic, and immunological criteria, the trout heart and muscle groups of lactate dehydrogenases appear to be homologous with the H4 and M4 enzymes, respectively, of higher vertebrates. In all the above tests, the trout liver isoenzyme behaved as a member of the heart group of lactate dehydrogenases, not as a member of the muscle group. The inclusion of the liver isoenzyme in the heart group was confirmed by experiments with an antiserum prepared against purified trout liver lactate dehydrogenase. These results, together with the published results of genetic experiments, appear to be consistent with the postulate that two distinct genes dictate the formation of the heart group of lactate dehydrogenases in trout."
https://openalex.org/W1481193748,"The conversion of a catalytic residue of an enzyme into a functional group with similar chemical and steric properties has been investigated in order to clarify the role of the catalytic group and its tolerance to change. The active site serine residue of the proteolytic enzyme, subtilisin, was converted into a cysteine residue by a two-step chemical process with no change in other properties of the enzyme, such as sedimentation pattern, starch gel electrophoresis pattern, amino acid composition, fluorescence, ultraviolet absorption, and chemical reactivity of tryptophan residues. A small change in the optical rotatory dispersion pattern was observed. The modified enzyme, thiol-subtilisin, was found to be inactive toward normal substrates, such as other proteins and simple esters, although a slight activity toward the labile nitrophenyl esters was observed. This inactivity of thiol-subtilisin could not be attributed to the binding of substrate, which appeared to be essentially unchanged, or to the deacylation step of the over-all reaction, which was decreased up to 100-fold. Rather, it is due to the diminished rate of the acylation step, which was undetectable. This result is contrary to the rates of model reactions of thiols and alcohols as nucleophiles. It is postulated that in the active site of the enzyme there is a critical alignment of catalytic groups and substrates which is necessary for activity. The polarizability and size of the —SH group, then, may be sufficiently greater than that of the —OH group that it perturbs this critical arrangement and prevents catalytic action."
https://openalex.org/W1608005689,"Abstract Synthesis of spore protein during sporulation was shown, by labeling with 3H-phenylalanine, to be accompanied by degradation of vegetative cell protein at a rate in excess of 18% per hour. In contrast, turnover during exponential growth is negligible. Turnover is nonspecific, in that protein newly synthesized during sporulation is degraded at the same rate as pre-existing vegetative cell protein. This general and extremely active degradation of protein during sporulation requires protein synthesis after the end of exponential growth but before turnover begins. However, once turnover commences, protein degradation continues even when protein synthesis is blocked. The percentage of protein newly synthesized in the forespore compartment during sporulation is significantly higher than that in the surrounding mother cell. Whether protein turnover occurs in the forespore as in the mother cell has not been established."

https://openalex.org/W1503691490,"Abstract Particulate enzyme preparations of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 catalyze the synthesis of 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-(α-d-glucopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol (monoglucosyl diglyceride), 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-(2-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-α-d-glucopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol (diglucosyl diglyceride), and a third glucolipid of unknown structure from two common precursors, UDP-glucose and 1,2-diglyceride. The three glucolipids appear to be formed sequentially. Isolated, radiochemically pure monoglucosyl diglyceride is converted to diglucosyl diglyceride in a reaction dependent upon UDP-glucose and enzyme. The biosynthetic enzyme or enzymes displayed a relatively high degree of specificity for UDP-glucose (the best of five nucleoside diphosphate glucose substrates tried) and for the 1,2 stereoconfiguration of the diglyceride substrate. 14C-Galactose of UDP-galactose-14C is converted to glucose prior to incorporation into glycolipids of S. faecalis. Of seven 14C-diglycerides, 14C-dilinolein served best as a substrate for the synthesis of the three glucolipids. Magnesium ion stimulates the reaction. None of 18 surface active agents tried appeared to enhance the enzymatic reaction. Consistent and relatively uniform stimulation of the biosynthesis by exogenous diglyceride was best achieved by adsorbing the diglyceride substrate directly to the lyophilized enzyme preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1484333506,"In aqueous extracts of rat brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve, a protein antigen has been detected which could not be shown in similarly prepared extracts of a variety of other rat tissues. The protein, designated antigen α, had a high mobility in zone electrophoresis at pH 7.4. Antigen α was isolated and was found to consist of a single type of subunit having a molecular weight of about 39,000. Evidence was obtained to suggest that the protein occurs in various aggregates stabilized by disulfide bonds. Antigen α is immunologically unrelated to another recently isolated acidic brain protein, the S-100 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1503876830,"Abstract A combination of hydroxylapatite and diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatographic fractionation procedures have been used to isolate a relatively large number of human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrases. Some of the crystalline minor isozymes isolated show two starch gel electrophoretic components, closely related in mobility. A combination of immunological, enzymatic, and 65Zn exchange reactions, in conjunction with starch gel electrophoretic separations, has permitted the demonstration of the presence in hemolysates of carbonic anhydrase isozymes with the same electrophoretic properties as the isolated isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W152982801,"Abstract Optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism spectra of the Pseudomonas blue protein and laccase B from Polyporus versicolor are presented from 190 to 700 mµ. Circular dichroism spectra of both proteins show six ellipticity bands above 300 mµ associated with the copper chromophore, indicating more transitions to be present in these copper protein complexes than the three parity-forbidden d-d transitions associated with Cu(II) in its common symmetries. A Gaussian analysis of the visible spectra of these proteins is presented. The same set of bands generates both the absorption and the circular dichroism spectra by the adjustment of the signs and the heights of the bands, while keeping the positions and the band widths constant. Below 1.8 x 104 cm-1, both proteins show three bands in the circular dichroism spectrum with signs (+, +, -) for the blue protein and (+, -, +) for laccase B. The uniqueness of the analysis has been established by using the Kronig-Kramers transform to generate the optical rotatory dispersion spectrum of the blue protein. Comparisons are made to the circular dichroism spectra of a Cu(II) complex of known donor atoms and geometry, [Cu(II)(glycyl-l-valine)]. Each protein creates a unique chemical environment for the aromatic residues. The Pseudomonas blue protein shows at least seven aromatic ellipticity bands, both positive and negative ([θ] ∼ ±6 x 103 deg cm2 per decimole), whereas laccase B shows three large positive aromatic bands ([θ] = 1 to 2.7 x 104 deg cm2 per decimole). In the region of the absorption bands of the peptide bonds, the blue protein shows a negative ellipticity band at 222 mµ ([θ] = 4.9 x 103 on a mean residue basis) and a positive band at 196 mµ ([θ] = 1.28 x 104 on a mean residue basis). A prominent negative band is not present at 206 mµ, and the circular dichroism spectrum exhibits a crossover point at 206 mµ. A preliminary analysis based on the computed contours of both the optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism spectra indicates a mixture of approximately 40% α-helix, 37% β structure, and 23% random coil. Laccase B shows a negative ellipticity band at 216 mµ ([θ] ∼ 4.1 x 103 on a mean residue basis) and a positive band at 196 mµ ([θ] ∼ 5.5 x 103 on a mean residue basis). Both features fit a β structure; however, the crossover occurs at 204 mµ and the computed curves indicate a mixture of β structure and random coil. The chemical interactions leading to the three-dimensional structure of the blue protein are apparently inherent in the primary chain. Acid denaturation, pH 1.5, destroys the ellipticity bands associated with the peptide bonds, the aromatic residues, and the copper chromophore. All are restored by return of the protein to neutral pH."
https://openalex.org/W1567731868,"Abstract Bacillus subtilis spore proteins were separated into two major fractions. One fraction, released by mechanical disruption into a soluble form, constitutes 20% of the spore protein and is designated the core fraction. It resembles in amino acid composition the protein of the cell early in sporulation and includes many of the cellular enzymes. The other 80% of spore proteins are in a particulate form after spore breakage and are designated the coat fraction. These proteins have an amino acid composition distinct from the core fraction and are heterogeneous. Studies on the synthesis of core and coat proteins, by labeling with tritiated phenylalanine, showed that protein of the core fraction is newly synthesized during sporulation to the extent of at least 75 to 90%, and protein in the coat fraction to the extent of 95%. The kinetics of labeling suggests an early synthesis of core proteins followed by that of coat proteins. The core proteins newly synthesized during the sporulation period, as well as those apparently borrowed from the vegetative cell, represent a large variety of protein species, including those of the ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1506084768,"The levels of eight enzymes from several different metabolic pathways were determined during growth and sporulation, as well as in the mature spore, of Bacillus subtilis. Three different patterns of development were observed. In one, the levels of DNA polymerase, adenylate kinase, and nucleoside phosphorylase closely followed that of total protein throughout growth and sporulation. In a second pattern, arginase, malic dehydrogenase, and ornithine transcarbamylase were undetectable in log phase cells and appeared only after the end of this period. In the third, aspartic transcarbamylase and IMP dehydrogenase were present during exponential phase but disappeared by the time of appearance of refractile spores. The pattern of development of several of these enzymes was different in an asporogenous, protease-negative strain. The susceptibility of certain of these enzymes to protease activity in extracts was observed, suggesting a possible role for protease elaborated during sporulation. In most instances, the specific activities of the enzymes in the spore were similar to their levels in stationary phase cells at the time of forespore formation. Certain enzymes were absent from spores or were present at very low levels. The results are discussed in relation to possible mechanisms for the origin of proteins found in the spore core."
https://openalex.org/W1601892825,"Abstract The energy-linked transport of K+ and other monovalent cations in isolated heart mitochondria is markedly activated by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate (CMS) and other mercurial reagents. The accumulation is supported by either respiration or exogenous ATP and is accompanied by reversible swelling. Respiration with physiological substrates is initially activated by CMS but becomes severely inhibited as the reaction proceeds. Sustained cation accumulation can be obtained with ascorbate and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylphenylenediamine as substrate. The energy-linked uptake of Li+, Na+, and other cations also appears to be activated by CMS. Maximum response is obtained in the presence of K+ and Li+, however. The activated accumulation of K+ can be abolished by the addition of cysteine and delayed by EDTA. We have previously reported that Zn++ and other heavy metal cations produce an activation of K+ accumulation similar to that seen with CMS. Zn++ added in addition to CMS produces enhanced uptake of K+ and swelling under most conditions, but the synergistic effect of the two reagents depends on the order of addition and the composition of the suspending medium. The effects of Zn++ are enhanced in media containing phosphate whereas those of CMS are inhibited by Pi. The amount of CMS which reacts with the membrane under the conditions of activated cation uptake depends on the concentration of CMS and the time of reaction. CMS uptake corresponding to about 10 to 20 mµmoles of fast reacting thiol groups results in maximum activation of monovalent cation uptake. The bulk of the total mitochondrial thiol groups are not available to the mercurial under the conditions of activated ion uptake. The reaction of mercurials with the mitochondrial membrane can be reversed by cysteine, and under these conditions the activated rate of swelling and ion uptake is inhibited."
https://openalex.org/W1626731447,"Abstract Carbonic anhydrase combines with the optically inactive azosulfonamide (disodium 2-(4-sulfamylphenylazo)-7-acetamido-1-hydroxynaphthalene-3,6-disulfonate) to form a highly colored enzyme-inhibitor complex. Large visible Cotton effects ([M] = 120,000°) are induced in the multiple visible absorption bands (e500 = 25,000) of the phenylazonaphthol chromophore by the dissymmetric environment of the protein binding site. Bathochromic-hypochromic shifts of these bands accompanying binding indicate the presence of a hydrophobic binding site. Circular dichroism spectra of azosulfonamide complexes of five isozyme and species variants of carbonic anhydrase reveal that both sign and magnitude of the multiple large visible ellipticity bands ([θ] = ± 0.5 - 8.0 x 104 deg cm2 per decimole, Rk = ± 0.4 - 19.7 x 10-39 c.g.s.u.) are unique for each isozyme. Thus the azosulfonamides become sensitive probes for conformational features of the active center of carbonic anhydrase. Ultraviolet ellipticity bands ([θ] = 1.5 x 106 deg cm2 per decimole) induced in the phenylazonaphthol chromophore are large enough in certain isozyme complexes to completely dominate both the circular dichroism and the rotatory dispersion of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes. In accordance with the metal ion specificity observed for the induction of hydration or esterase activity in apocarbonic anhydrase, only Zn(II) and Co(II) at the active site induce the specific binding of the azosulfonamide which imparts optical activity to the visible absorption bands of the sulfonamide. Marked differences in the pattern of ellipticity bands induced in the sulfonamide by the Zn(II) and Co(II) enzymes, however, indicate participation of the metal ion in determining the final conformation of the bound sulfonamide or the active center as well as determining the binding affinity of the enzyme for the sulfonamide inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1513668143,"Abstract Two distinct components of carbonic anhydrase (EC 4.2.1.1) have been purified from horse red cells. In the isolation procedure described, the large excess of hemoglobin was removed by precipitation in ammonium sulfate, and the two carbonic anhydrase proteins were then separated by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. This separation was facilitated by the remarkably high isoelectric point of the basic component, which appeared to have a net positive charge even at pH 10.0. This basic component, which was designated enzyme C, constituted only 36% of the total carbonic anhydrase protein but had a high specific activity; with the use of the WilburAnderson assay for CO2 hydration, this was in the order of 40,000 units per mg. The major protein, designated enzyme B, had a much lower specific activity, in the order of 4,000 units per mg. The extinction coefficients and s20,w values of the purified B and C proteins were measured, as well as the Km and Vmax values for their hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate. The amino acid compositions and the optical rotatory dispersion spectra are also reported. The two components of horse carbonic anhydrase described here give a further example of the unusual type of polymorphism already seen with primate carbonic anhydrase. This suggests that it may be a characteristic of the enzyme from the blood of a variety of mammalian species. The salient features seem to be firstly, the presence of two chemically distinct proteins catalyzing the same reaction at different rates, and secondly, the much greater abundance of the less active form. The isolation of two horse enzymes brings to seven the number of carbonic anhydrases now studied in a highly purified state. These are classified as either high specific activity forms (human, rhesus monkey, and horse C enzymes, bovine B enzyme) or low specific activity forms (human, rhesus monkey, and horse B enzymes), and the proteins in each category are then compared in terms of amino acid composition, kinetics, and optical rotatory dispersion."
https://openalex.org/W2106726937,"Some compounds, not directly inhibitory or enhancing, nevertheless influence growth of tubercle bacilli in macrophages in cell culture. They include certain surfactants whose effects can be varied by their structural design. The compounds are probably stored in cell lysosomes. They can interact with various membranes to affect permeability. The anti- and protuberculous surfactants differ in such interaction and also in effect on lysosomal enzyme activity in infected macrophages. A link between the effect on lysosomal membranes and on tuberculous infection is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1506038615,"Bovine carbonic anhydrase form B studied by hydrogen exchange kinetics shows slower rates than measured in model compounds for 50% of its hydrogen atoms; 18% of the hydrogen atoms remain unchanged after 24 hours. In this respect the enzyme is similar to ribonuclease and chymotrypsinogen. The pH and ionic strength dependence favors out-exchange with different rate constants for a large number of hydrogen sites both in native and in acid-unfolded states. The pH dependence further indicates that the protein molecule expands or shows loosening of structure with pH changing from 9 to 5. The activation energy for the exchange rate in the unfolded state is 21 ± 4 kcal. In the native state, the exchange of the 80 slowest hydrogen atoms shows an activation energy varying with temperature from 37 ± 4 kcal at 37° to 48 ± 4 kcal at 40°. The present observations are best explained by the existence of two exchange mechanisms; one proceeding through cooperative reversible thermal unfolding, the dominating process at higher temperatures, and another proceeding through noncooperative local rearrangements of low activation energy, dominating the exchange at low temperature."

https://openalex.org/W1593874386,"Abstract Evidence has been presented that chick embryo deoxycytidylate deaminase (EC 3.5.4.12) is capable of undergoing structural changes under a variety of conditions. Rate studies revealed that inhibition of the enzyme by ethylenediaminetetraacetate markedly diminishes at 10° and below. Although EDTA does not inhibit the deaminase at 10°, the inhibition by urea, N-ethylmaleimide, and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) is dramatically enhanced in its presence. End product inhibition by deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate, shown to be both pH and concentration dependent, is completely eliminated at 10° by EDTA. The reversal of deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate inhibition by deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate is markedly sigmoidal, emphasizing the regulatory interaction of these ligands. Hill constants for the reaction of the enzyme with substrate in the presence of deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate and deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate are 1.0 and 4.0, respectively. The Hill constant for the homotropic reaction of deoxycytidine 5'-monophosphate with the deaminase at 30° is 4.0, whereas that at 10° is 2.8. The apparent Km value for the activation of the deaminase by deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate is 2.12 x 10-4 mm. The subunit structure of the deaminase is emphasized by its conversion from an s0.72520,w value of 6.78 in the presence of deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate to a value of 3.63 S in the presence of deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate. The latter form of the enzyme is inactive when assayed in the absence of mercaptoethanol. Deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate and, to a lesser extent, deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate and deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate protect the deaminase rather strikingly from inactivation by trypsin. The low molecular weight, inactive form, of the enzyme is not protected under similar circumstances."

https://openalex.org/W1554313123,"Abstract The ribosomal particles and nucleic acid components of Bacillus megaterium log phase cells and spores were isolated and compared. Analysis of the total RNA indicated that 23 S, 16 S, and 4 S components were present, in the same relative proportions in both cases. Soluble RNA was 19% of vegetative cell RNA and 21% of spore RNA. Particles sedimenting at values greater than 100 S and sensitive to pancreatic ribonuclease were present in lysates of both vegetative cells and spores. Although the spore particles were small in size and quantity and were relatively unstable, they suggest the existence of polysomes and associated messenger RNA in spores. Ribosomes purified from either source were mainly 70 S and 100 S particles and were quantitatively dissociated into 50 S and 30 S subunits in each case. Isolation of RNA from purified ribosomes yielded 23 S and 16 S material in a ratio of about 2:1. Although thermal denaturation profiles of ribosomal RNA isolated from both sources were identical, spore ribosomes melted at a lower temperature than vegetative cell ribosomes, possibly because of the presence of nuclease. DNA isolated from either vegetative cells or spores had a buoyant density in CsCl of 1.698 g per cc, and no satellite DNA was evident. These results indicate that the ribosome and nucleic acid components of log phase cells and spores are similar in relative amounts and physicochemical properties."
https://openalex.org/W1530865545,"A glucanosyltransferase has been obtained in a high state of purity from a bacterium of the Bacillus group. The enzyme is distinct from the other carbohydrases produced by the organism. The pH optimum for the transferase is 5, and the molecular weight is in the range of 70,000 to 80,000. The transferase is stable at low temperatures but is rapidly inactivated at elevated temperatures. The new enzyme effects a transfer of glucanosyl segments from maltopentaose, higher molecular weight maltohomologues or starch to maltopentaose, and other maltohomologues to yield new oligosaccharides. The transferase may be of importance in the metabolism of starch in the bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W1981086489,The minimum temperature of growth of the mesophilic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been significantly lowered from approximately 11 degrees to 0 degrees C. This shift in the minimum temperature of growth was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the maximum temperature of growth. Transfer of this genetic characteristic by a transducing phage grown on a psychrophile or by ultraviolet mutagenesis was used to accomplish these shifts in range of growth temperature.

https://openalex.org/W1502347985,"Abstract The protein-synthesizing systems isolated from vegetative cells and spores of Bacillus megaterium were compared. The capacity for polyphenylalanine synthesis, directed by polyuridylate, was essentially the same for both systems under optimal conditions and amounted to approximately 8 mµmoles of phenylalanine incorporated in 30 min per mg of ribosomal protein. Amino acid incorporation dependent on endogenous messenger RNA in the spore system was 20 to 30% of that obtained with endogenous vegetative cell messenger. The requirements of each system for Mg++, NH4+, and spermidine were similar, as were the pH optima. Some differences between the two systems were observed in their dependence on ribosomes, supernatant fractions, transfer RNA, and polyuridylate. Transfer RNA from vegetative cells and spores had similar acceptor activities for several amino acids; however, methionine was esterified to spore transfer RNA at 3 times the level seen with vegetative cell material. Spore ribosomes contained an inhibitor of amino acid incorporation. Nuclease activity, assayed by hydrolysis of polyuridylate, was greater in spore ribosomes and supernatant fractions than in their vegetative cell counterparts. These results suggest that the capacity for protein synthesis is identical in spores and vegetative cells, and that the deficiencies in the spore system observed under certain conditions may be attributable to the presence of nuclease."

https://openalex.org/W1513700833,"Abstract Spores of Bacillus megaterium, opened by lysozyme, released an inner globular mass which was visible by phase contrast microscopy. Ruptured spores were observed, by whole mount electron microscopy, to be connected by thin filaments which could be removed by deoxyribonuclease, whereas the globular mass was relatively insensitive to this treatment. A nuclear fraction, isolated from cells and spores by differential sedimentation, contained most of the DNA as well as the DNA and RNA polymerases but relatively little RNA or protein. The polymerases resemble other bacterial polymerases except for template dependence. Only after DNase treatment did the RNA polymerase, previously in a tight complex with DNA, show a requirement for DNA or polyuridylate. The DNA polymerase responded to exogenous template, even in the nuclear fraction. The nuclear fraction isolated from spores was virtually indistinguishable from that obtained from growing vegetative cells. However, the amounts of protein, RNA, and DNA per cell did differ in the several stages of growth and sporulation."
https://openalex.org/W1989715315,"THERE are several reports of the isolation from cases of human upper respiratory infections of viruses with a structure known previously only in the viruses causing avian infectious bronchitis1 and mouse hepatitis2. The first isolate, named B814, was propagated in organ cultures of human embryo respiratory epithelium3, and most of the other isolates have been made in organ culture4. Some viruses of humans, of the type 229E, multiply in tissue cultures of human embryo kidney fibroblasts where they cause a slight cytopathic effect, and in human embryo lung fibroblasts where they cause a definite progressive cytopathic effect5. Those viruses only cultivated in organ culture were detected either by electron, microscopy, or by inoculation into human volunteers, or by stopping the ciliary activity of the organ culture epithelium. It has been proposed that the group of virsues with this morphology should be called “coronaviruses”6."
https://openalex.org/W1581583865,"Abstract The optical rotatory dispersion of purified γM-macroglobulins from patients with Waldenstroms' macroglobulinemia shows a minimum at 232 mµ, a poorly resolved shoulder at 235 mµ, and a maximum at 206 mµ. The Cotton effect at 240 mµ characteristic of γG-globulin could not be detected in intact γM-globulin. Mild reduction of γM to give the subunit (γMs) does not result in any change in conformation as judged by rotatory dispersion. The optical rotatory dispersion of F(ab')2µ and Fabµ fragments produced by tryptic hydrolysis of γM-globulin shows a single minimum at 225 mµ and a Cotton effect near 240 mµ. The levorotation above 240 mµ is low and changes little with wave length. Further studies with the Fabµ and Fcµ fragments produced during papain digestion of γM-globulin indicate that the large rotation of Fcµ fragment (with a minimum at 232 mµ) masks the 240 mµ Cotton effect of Fabµ when the two are present together. Both calculated and experimental curves of mixtures of Fabµ and Fcµ show that this Cotton effect would be experimentally undetectable in intact γM-globulin. The results indicate that there are significant differences in conformation between γM- and γG-globulins. These differences are present in both the Fabµ and Fcµ regions of the molecule."

https://openalex.org/W60368057,"The chemical modification of the tyrosyl residues in human carbonic anhydrases B and C (EC 4.2.1.1) has been studied in relation to its effects on enzymatic activity, optical rotatory dispersion, and circular dichroism. These studies involved nitration of tyrosyl residues in both enzymes with tetranitromethane and iodination of carbonic anhydrase B. New data on the circular dichroism of the native human carbonic anhydrases, obtained on a JASCO instrument, are reported, and are compared with earlier data of Beychok et al., obtained on a Jouan dichrograph. In general, the data on the two instruments are in close agreement, but some differences are noted, and the new data extend to shorter wave lengths than before. The number of available tyrosyl residues for nitration in carbonic anhydrase B is nearly identical with the number of freely titratable tyrosyls previously estimated by the spectrophotometric titrations of Riddiford. The data reported here show that three tyrosyl groups in carbonic anhydrase B can be nitrated at pH 7 to 8.5; one of these reacts more slowly than the others. Carbonic anhydrase C contains only two tyrosyl groups that can be nitrated under the same conditions. More such groups become available when the reaction occurs at higher pH values, above pH 9 for enzyme C or pH 10 for enzyme B. Nitration of the carbonic anhydrases, at pH 8.5 or below, does not change their enzymatic activities. The optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism spectra of the nitrated proteins are indistinguishable from those of the native enzymes, although a new absorption band, at 422 mµ in enzyme B and 428 mµ in enzyme C, is introduced by the formation of 3-nitrotyrosyl residues. Iodination of carbonic anhydrase B caused a decrease in the esterase activity of the enzyme when 2 tyrosyl residues or more were converted to diiodotyrosyl residues. There were accompanying changes in rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism spectra that indicated some loss of the native structure. Urea treatment of the nitrated proteins results in blue shifts of the aromatic absorption bands, similar to the shifts observed for the native enzymes. Although the shapes of the urea difference spectra are very similar for the nitrated and for the native enzymes, slight differences are observed, especially for enzyme B. The urea difference spectra for the nitrated proteins also depend on the urea concentration; the dependence is very similar to that observed for the native enzymes. Urea treatment also exposes the buried tyrosyl groups which become available for nitration. All of the tyrosyls become available for nitration even at urea concentrations at which unfolding of the proteins is not complete as estimated from the difference spectra. Unfolding of the enzymes at high urea concentration is only partially reversible, and refolding depends on the duration of urea treatment. However, Cotton effects in the 250 to 300 mµ region are irreversibly lost in 8 m urea, even in cases in which partial refolding can be shown by difference spectra."

https://openalex.org/W1947037881,"Abstract The controlled digestion of human immunoglobulin M (IgM) (Patient Dau.) with papain in the presence of 0.002 m mercaptoethylamine resulted in the release of a basic subunit-like fragment which we designated IgMp. It resembled the subunit (IgMs) produced by mild reduction of IgM in the following ways. The molecular weight (186,000) and sedimentation coefficient (6.2 to 6.5 S) of IgMp were similar to those of IgMs. IgMp contained light chains and a large portion of each of its µ chains. IgMp was antigenically identical with IgMs and IgM when tested with specific anti-IgM antiserum. The mobilities of IgMp and IgMs in agarose seemed to be virtually identical. In contrast, IgMp did not possess the free sulfhydryl groups which were found on IgMs. It was concluded that IgMp was formed from IgM by proteolysis of the µ chains near the carboxyl terminus. The fragment retained intact its interchain disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1507270086,"Abstract The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6, nucleoside triphosphate:RNA nucleotidyl transferase) from Micrococcus lysodeikticus was only partially inactivated by carboxypeptidases A and B, was almost completely inactivated by trypsin and subtilisin, and was resistant to chymotrypsin. DNA-bound RNA polymerase was also partially susceptible to the carboxypeptidases, to trypsin, and to subtilisin. During transcription the resistance of the RNA polymerase to these proteolytic enzymes increases 25 to 35%. This increased resistance suggests that either the structure or the environment of the RNA polymerase is different in the ternary complex, DNA-RNA polymerase-RNA, than it is in the binary complex, DNA-RNA polymerase. The carboxypeptidase studies suggest that the carboxy-terminal residue or residues of the RNA polymerase enzyme may not be used in transcription."
