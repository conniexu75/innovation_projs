https://openalex.org/W2090988802,"An electron donor-acceptor-donor molecule consisting of two porphyrin donors rigidly attached to the two-electron acceptor N,N'-diphenyl-3,4,9,10-perylenebis(dicarboximide) acts as a light intensity-dependent molecular switch on a picosecond time scale. Excitation of the porphyrins within this molecule with subpicosecond laser pulses results in single or double reduction of the acceptor depending on the light intensity. The singly and doubly reduced electron acceptors absorb light strongly at 713 and 546 nanometers, respectively. Because these absorption changes are produced solely by electron transfers, this molecular switch effectively has no moving parts and switches significantly faster than photochromic molecules that must undergo changes in molecular structure."

This calculation confirms that the evolution of the solar system as a whole is chaotic, with a time scale of exponential divergence of about 4 million years. Additional numerical experiments indicate that the Jovian planet subsystem is chaotic, although some small variations in the model can yield quasiperiodic motion. The motion of Pluto is independently and robustly chaotic."
https://openalex.org/W2059818128,"Root nodules of leguminous plants are symbiotic organs in which Rhizobium bacteria fix nitrogen. Their formation requires the induction of a nodule meristem and the formation of a tubular structure, the infection thread, through which the rhizobia reach the nodule primordium. In the Rhizobium host plants pea and vetch, pre-infection thread structures always preceded the formation of infection threads. These structures consisted of cytoplasmic bridges traversing the central vacuole of outer cortical root cells, aligned in radial rows. In vetch, the site of the infection thread was determined by the plant rather than by the invading rhizobia. Like nodule primordia, pre-infection thread structures could be induced in the absence of rhizobia provided that mitogenic lipo-oligosaccharides produced by Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae were added to the plant. In this case, cells in the two outer cortical cell layers containing cytoplasmic bridges may have formed root hairs. A common morphogenetic pathway may be shared in the formation of root hairs and infection threads."
https://openalex.org/W2077358363,"Treatment of anodized or chemically etched silicon (""porous silicon"") with dilute nitric acid or persulfate solution results in weak chemiluminescence in the visible region. Concentrated nitric acid reacts violently with porous Si produced by anodization with a bright flash of light. The fact that similar reactions occur with siloxene (Si(6)H(6)O(3)) prepared from CaSi(2) suggests that the visible emission seen with porous Si can be attributed to this substance."
https://openalex.org/W2087941309,"Chemical hydrolysis of the s-triazines after interaction with less than 2-micron (equivalent spherical diameter) montmorillonite clay occurs as a result of protonation at the colloidal surface; protonation occurs even when the exchange sites are occupied by metallic cations. The adsorbed hydrolytic degradation product is not the hydroxy analog, but it is predominantly the keto form of the protonated hydroxy species. This cationic form is held tightly by the clay which may restrict vertical movement and entrance into groundwater. Protonation of the hydroxy analog occurs on the heterocyclic ring nitrogen."

https://openalex.org/W2025568258,"The compressional wave velocities of polycrystalline NaCl and KCl have been measured to over 17 gigapascals, with the use of Brillouin scattering and the diamond anvil cell. This pressure corresponds to 40% compression for NaCl and 60% compression for KCl (including the volume change across the B1-B2 transition). The data obey Birch's Law, which predicts that the velocity of each material is linear with density, except across the B1-B2 phase transition in KCl. This deviation from Birch's Law can be rationalized in terms of an interatomic potential model wherein the vibrational frequencies of the nearest neighbor bonds decrease when going to the eight-coordinated B2 structure from the six-coordinated B1 structure."

Only an upper limit of 0.03 could be determined for the ratio of aluminum-26 to beryllium-10 in the sediment. The ratio is probably explained by production by cosmic rays in the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2036622558,"Ordering of the octahedral sheet of some lithium-iron micas is proposed on the basis of chemical compositions and crystallographic properties. The model of the ordered sheet has large and small sites in the ratio 2 : 1 and explains all observed properties- the small layer thickness, the ""dioctahedral reflections,"" and the n(120 deg) motif in polytypism."
https://openalex.org/W2009315079,Replication of ice crystals with vapor of methyl 2-cyanoacrylate has produced evidence of whiskers on them; an additional mechanism for the necessary multiplication of ice crystals in the atmosphere is suggested. This replication technique also confirms crystal clustering in the atmosphere and appears to confirm the distribution of electrical charge on ice crystals.

https://openalex.org/W2038450703,"The incremental frequency distribution of Martian crater diameters larger than 20 to 30 kilometers follows an inverse-square law, with density equal to that of craters on the lunar continents. This finding accords with the prediction that lunar continents and the Martian surface carry an equilibrium density (saturation) of craters originating in meteoroidal impact. Therefore crater statistics alone cannot be used for estimation of the age of the Martian surface."

Such peralkaline rocks-which are not uncommon in the western United States-and other chemically unusual silicic rocks are found near the margins rather than toward the center of the Great Basin."

https://openalex.org/W2041417561,"How will increases in levels of CO{sub 2} and changes in temperature affect food production A recently issued report analyzes prospects for US agriculture 1990 to 2030. The report, prepared by a distinguished Task Force, first projects the evolution of agriculture assuming increased levels of CO{sub 2} but no climate change. Then it deals with effects of climate change, followed by a discussion of how greenhouse emissions might be diminished by agriculture. Economic and policy matters are also covered. How the climate would respond to more greenhouse gases is uncertain. If temperatures were higher, there would be more evaporation and more precipitation. Where would the rain fall That is a good question. Weather in a particular locality is not determined by global averages. The Dust Bowl of the 1930s could be repeated at its former site or located in another region such as the present Corn Belt. But depending on the realities at a given place, farmers have demonstrated great flexibility in choosing what they may grow. Their flexibility has been increased by the numerous varieties of seeds of major crops that are now available, each having different characteristics such as drought resistance and temperature tolerance. In past, agriculture hasmore » contributed about 5% of US greenhouse gases. Two large components have involved emissions of CO{sub 2} from farm machinery and from oxidation of organic matter in soil due to tillage. Use of diesel fuel and more efficient machinery has reduced emissions from that source by 40%. In some areas changed tillage practices are now responsible for returning carbon to the soil. The report identifies an important potential for diminishing net US emissions of CO{sub 2} by growth and utilization of biomass. Large areas are already available that could be devoted to energy crops.« less"
