https://openalex.org/W2134027168,"Background and Aims Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes amongst clopidogrel users after an acute coronary syndrome. Recent pre-clinical results suggest that this risk might extend to subjects without any prior history of cardiovascular disease. We explore this potential risk in the general population via data-mining approaches. Methods Using a novel approach for mining clinical data for pharmacovigilance, we queried over 16 million clinical documents on 2.9 million individuals to examine whether PPI usage was associated with cardiovascular risk in the general population. Results In multiple data sources, we found gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients exposed to PPIs to have a 1.16 fold increased association (95% CI 1.09–1.24) with myocardial infarction (MI). Survival analysis in a prospective cohort found a two-fold (HR = 2.00; 95% CI 1.07–3.78; P = 0.031) increase in association with cardiovascular mortality. We found that this association exists regardless of clopidogrel use. We also found that H2 blockers, an alternate treatment for GERD, were not associated with increased cardiovascular risk; had they been in place, such pharmacovigilance algorithms could have flagged this risk as early as the year 2000. Conclusions Consistent with our pre-clinical findings that PPIs may adversely impact vascular function, our data-mining study supports the association of PPI exposure with risk for MI in the general population. These data provide an example of how a combination of experimental studies and data-mining approaches can be applied to prioritize drug safety signals for further investigation."

We assessed the population trend of the world’s monitored seabirds (1950–2010) by compiling a global database of seabird population size records and applying multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) modeling to estimate the overall population trend of the portion of the population with sufficient data (i.e., at least five records). This monitored population represented approximately 19% of the global seabird population. We found the monitored portion of the global seabird population to have declined overall by 69.7% between 1950 and 2010. This declining trend may reflect the global seabird population trend, given the large and apparently representative sample. Furthermore, the largest declines were observed in families containing wide-ranging pelagic species, suggesting that pan-global populations may be more at risk than shorter-ranging coastal populations."
https://openalex.org/W1793908464,"Extracellular ATP binds to and signals through P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) to modulate immune function in both inflammasome-dependent and -independent manners. In this study, P2X7(-/-) mice, the pharmacological agonists ATP-magnesium salt (Mg-ATP; 100 mg/kg, EC50 ≈ 1.32 mM) and benzoylbenzoyl-ATP (Bz-ATP; 10 mg/kg, EC50 ≈ 285 μM), and antagonist oxidized ATP (oxi-ATP; 40 mg/kg, IC50 ≈ 100 μM) were used to show that P2X7R activation is crucial for the control of mortality, bacterial dissemination, and inflammation in cecal ligation and puncture-induced polymicrobial sepsis in mice. Our results with P2X7(-/-) bone marrow chimeric mice, adoptive transfer of peritoneal macrophages, and myeloid-specific P2X7(-/-) mice indicate that P2X7R signaling on macrophages is essential for the protective effect of P2X7Rs. P2X7R signaling protects through enhancing bacterial killing by macrophages, which is independent of the inflammasome. By using the connexin (Cx) channel inhibitor Gap27 (0.1 mg/kg, IC50 ≈ 0.25 μM) and pannexin channel inhibitor probenecid (10 mg/kg, IC50 ≈ 11.7 μM), we showed that ATP release through Cx is important for inhibiting inflammation and bacterial burden. In summary, targeting P2X7Rs provides a new opportunity for harnessing an endogenous protective immune mechanism in the treatment of sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W586431697,"As people increasingly communicate via asynchronous non-spoken modes on mobile devices, particularly text messaging (e.g., SMS), longstanding assumptions and practices of social measurement via telephone survey interviewing are being challenged. In the study reported here, 634 people who had agreed to participate in an interview on their iPhone were randomly assigned to answer 32 questions from US social surveys via text messaging or speech, administered either by a human interviewer or by an automated interviewing system. 10 interviewers from the University of Michigan Survey Research Center administered voice and text interviews; automated systems launched parallel text and voice interviews at the same time as the human interviews were launched. The key question was how the interview mode affected the quality of the response data, in particular the precision of numerical answers (how many were not rounded), variation in answers to multiple questions with the same response scale (differentiation), and disclosure of socially undesirable information. Texting led to higher quality data-fewer rounded numerical answers, more differentiated answers to a battery of questions, and more disclosure of sensitive information-than voice interviews, both with human and automated interviewers. Text respondents also reported a strong preference for future interviews by text. The findings suggest that people interviewed on mobile devices at a time and place that is convenient for them, even when they are multitasking, can give more trustworthy and accurate answers than those in more traditional spoken interviews. The findings also suggest that answers from text interviews, when aggregated across a sample, can tell a different story about a population than answers from voice interviews, potentially altering the policy implications from a survey."
https://openalex.org/W2172390696,"During apoptosis the pro-death Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) to mediate cell death. Recently, it was shown that Bax and Bak are also required for mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP)-dependent necrosis, where, in their non-oligomeric state, they enhance permeability characteristics of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Necroptosis is another form of regulated necrosis involving the death receptors and receptor interacting protein kinases (RIP proteins, by Ripk genes). Here, we show cells or mice deficient for Bax/Bak or cyclophilin D, a protein that regulates MPTP opening, are resistant to cell death induced by necroptotic mediators. We show that Bax/Bak oligomerization is required for necroptotic cell death and that this oligomerization reinforces MPTP opening. Mechanistically, we observe mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein and cofilin-1 translocation to the mitochondria following necroptosis induction, while expression of the mitochondrial matrix isoform of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), is significantly reduced. Some of these effects are lost with necroptosis inhibition in Bax/Bak1 double null, Ppif-/-, or Ripk3-/- fibroblasts. Hence, downstream mechanisms of cell death induced by necroptotic stimuli utilize both Bax/Bak to generate apoptotic pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane as well as MPTP opening in association with known mitochondrial death modifying proteins."
https://openalex.org/W577125566,"To investigate the relationship between physical activity and two measures of fall incidence in an elderly population using person-years as well as hours walked as denominators and to compare these two approaches.Prospective cohort study with one-year follow-up of falls using fall calendars. Physical activity was defined as walking duration and recorded at baseline over one week using a thigh-worn uni-axial accelerometer (activPAL; PAL Technologies, Glasgow, Scotland). Average daily physical activity was extracted from these data and categorized in low (0-59 min), medium (60-119 min) and high (120 min and more) activity.The ActiFE Ulm study located in Ulm and adjacent regions in Southern Germany.1,214 community-dwelling older people (≥65 years, 56.4% men).Negative-binomial regression models were used to calculate fall rates and incidence rate ratios for each activity category each with using (1) person-years and (2) hours walked as denominators stratified by gender, age group, fall history, and walking speed. All analyses were adjusted either for gender, age, or both.No statistically significant association was seen between falls per person-year and average daily physical activity. However, when looking at falls per 100 hours walked, those who were low active sustained more falls per hours walked. The highest incidence rates of falls were seen in low-active persons with slow walking speed (0.57 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.33 to 0.98) falls per 100 hours walked) or history of falls (0.60 (95% CI: 0.36 to 0.99) falls per 100 hours walked).Falls per hours walked is a relevant and sensitive outcome measure. It complements the concept of incidence per person years, and gives an additional perspective on falls in community-dwelling older people."
https://openalex.org/W854589012,"Objective Given that helminth infections have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in animal studies, which may be explained by beneficial effects on energy balance or by a shift in the immune system to an anti-inflammatory profile, we investigated whether soil-transmitted helminth (STH)-infected subjects are more insulin sensitive than STH-uninfected subjects. Design We performed a cross-sectional study on Flores island, Indonesia, an area with high prevalence of STH infections. Methods From 646 adults, stool samples were screened for Trichuris trichiura by microscopy and for Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale, and Strongyloides stercoralis by qPCR. No other helminth was found. We collected data on body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), fasting blood glucose (FBG, mmol/L), insulin (pmol/L), high sensitive C-reactive protein (ng/ml) and Immunoglobulin E (IU/ml). The homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMAIR) was calculated and regression models were used to assess the association between STH infection status and insulin resistance. Results 424 (66%) participants had at least one STH infection. STH infected participants had lower BMI (23.2 vs 22.5 kg/m2, p value = 0.03) and lower HOMAIR (0.97 vs 0.81, p value = 0.05). In an age-, sex- and BMI-adjusted model a significant association was seen between the number of infections and HOMAIR: for every additional infection with STH species, the HOMAIR decreased by 0.10 (p for linear trend 0.01). This effect was mainly accounted for by a decrease in insulin of 4.9 pmol/L for every infection (p for trend = 0.07). Conclusion STH infections are associated with a modest improvement of insulin sensitivity, which is not accounted for by STH effects on BMI alone."
https://openalex.org/W602677538,"Multivariate data sets often differ in several factors or derived statistical parameters, which have to be selected for a valid interpretation. Basing this selection on traditional statistical limits leads occasionally to the perception of losing information from a data set. This paper proposes a novel method for calculating precise limits for the selection of parameter sets.The algorithm is based on an ABC analysis and calculates these limits on the basis of the mathematical properties of the distribution of the analyzed items. The limits implement the aim of any ABC analysis, i.e., comparing the increase in yield to the required additional effort. In particular, the limit for set A, the ""important few"", is optimized in a way that both, the effort and the yield for the other sets (B and C), are minimized and the additional gain is optimized.As a typical example from biomedical research, the feasibility of the ABC analysis as an objective replacement for classical subjective limits to select highly relevant variance components of pain thresholds is presented. The proposed method improved the biological interpretation of the results and increased the fraction of valid information that was obtained from the experimental data.The method is applicable to many further biomedical problems including the creation of diagnostic complex biomarkers or short screening tests from comprehensive test batteries. Thus, the ABC analysis can be proposed as a mathematically valid replacement for traditional limits to maximize the information obtained from multivariate research data."
https://openalex.org/W813766577,"p53 is a master tumour repressor that participates in vast regulatory networks, including feedback loops involving microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate p53 and that themselves are direct p53 transcriptional targets. We show here that a group of polycistronic miRNA-like non-coding RNAs derived from small nucleolar RNAs (sno-miRNAs) are transcriptionally repressed by p53 through their host gene, SNHG1. The most abundant of these, sno-miR-28, directly targets the p53-stabilizing gene, TAF9B. Collectively, p53, SNHG1, sno-miR-28 and TAF9B form a regulatory loop which affects p53 stability and downstream p53-regulated pathways. In addition, SNHG1, SNORD28 and sno-miR-28 are all significantly upregulated in breast tumours and the overexpression of sno-miR-28 promotes breast epithelial cell proliferation. This research has broadened our knowledge of the crosstalk between small non-coding RNA pathways and roles of sno-miRNAs in p53 regulation."
https://openalex.org/W623659374,"Treatment dissatisfaction and non-adherence are common among patients with psoriasis, partly due to discordance between individual preferences and recommended treatments. However, patients are more satisfied with biologicals than with other treatments. The aim of our study was to assess patient preferences for treatment of psoriasis with biologicals by using computer-based conjoint analysis. Biologicals approved for psoriasis in Germany were decomposed into outcome (probability of 50% and 90% improvement, time until response, sustainability of success, probability of mild and severe adverse events (AE), probability of American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response) and process attributes (treatment location, frequency, duration and delivery method). Impact of sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics and disease severity on Relative Importance Scores (RIS) of each attribute was assessed with analyses of variance, post hoc tests, and multivariate regression. Averaged across the cohort of 200 participants with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, preferences were highest for avoiding severe AE (RIS = 17.3), followed by 90% improvement (RIS = 14.0) and avoiding mild AE (RIS = 10.5). Process attributes reached intermediate RIS (8.2–8.8). Men were more concerned about efficacy than women (50% improvement: RIS = 6.9 vs. 9.5, p = 0.008; β = -0.191, p = 0.011 in multivariate models; 90% improvement: RIS = 12.1 vs. 15.4, p = 0.002; β = -0.197, p = 0.009). Older participants judged the probability of 50% and 90% improvement less relevant than younger ones (50% improvement: Pearson’s Correlation (PC) = -0.161, p = 0.022; β = -0.219, p = 0.017; 90% improvement: PC = -0.155, p = 0.028; β = -0.264, p = 0.004) but worried more about severe AE (PC = 0.175, p = 0.013; β = 0.166, p = 0.082). In summary, participants with moderate-to-severe psoriasis were most interested in safety of biologicals, followed by efficacy, but preferences varied with sociodemographic characteristics and working status. Based on this knowledge, physicians should identify preferences of each individual patient during shared decision-making in order to optimize treatment satisfaction, adherence and outcome."
https://openalex.org/W1533868367,"The trail making test (TMT) is widely used to assess speed of processing and executive function. However, normative data sets gathered at different sites show significant inconsistencies. Here, we describe a computerized version of the TMT (C-TMT) that increases the precision and replicability of the TMT by permitting a segment-by-segment analysis of performance and separate analyses of dwell-time, move-time, and error time. Experiment 1 examined 165 subjects of various ages and found that completion times on both the C-TMT-A (where subjects connect successively numbered circles) and the C-TMT-B (where subjects connect circles containing alternating letters and numbers) were strongly influenced by age. Experiment 2 examined 50 subjects who underwent three test sessions. The results of the first test session were well fit by the normative data gathered in Experiment 1. Sessions 2 and 3 demonstrated significant learning effects, particularly on the C-TMT-B, and showed good test-retest reliability. Experiment 3 examined performance in subjects instructed to feign symptoms of traumatic brain injury: 44% of subjects produced abnormal completion times on the C-TMT-A, and 18% on the C-TMT-B. Malingering subjects could be distinguished from abnormally slow controls based on (1) disproportionate increases in dwell-time on the C-TMT-A, and (2) greater deficits on the C-TMT-A than on the C-TMT-B. Experiment 4 examined the performance of 28 patients with traumatic brain injury: C-TMT-B completion times were slowed, and TBI patients showed reduced movement velocities on both tests. The C-TMT improves the reliability and sensitivity of the trail making test of processing speed and executive function."
https://openalex.org/W579256809,"Community ecologists commonly perform multivariate techniques (e.g., ordination, cluster analysis) to assess patterns and gradients of taxonomic variation. A critical requirement for a meaningful statistical analysis is accurate information on the taxa found within an ecological sample. However, oversampling (too many individuals counted per sample) also comes at a cost, particularly for ecological systems in which identification and quantification is substantially more resource consuming than the field expedition itself. In such systems, an increasingly larger sample size will eventually result in diminishing returns in improving any pattern or gradient revealed by the data, but will also lead to continually increasing costs. Here, we examine 396 datasets: 44 previously published and 352 created datasets. Using meta-analytic and simulation-based approaches, the research within the present paper seeks (1) to determine minimal sample sizes required to produce robust multivariate statistical results when conducting abundance-based, community ecology research. Furthermore, we seek (2) to determine the dataset parameters (i.e., evenness, number of taxa, number of samples) that require larger sample sizes, regardless of resource availability. We found that in the 44 previously published and the 220 created datasets with randomly chosen abundances, a conservative estimate of a sample size of 58 produced the same multivariate results as all larger sample sizes. However, this minimal number varies as a function of evenness, where increased evenness resulted in increased minimal sample sizes. Sample sizes as small as 58 individuals are sufficient for a broad range of multivariate abundance-based research. In cases when resource availability is the limiting factor for conducting a project (e.g., small university, time to conduct the research project), statistically viable results can still be obtained with less of an investment."
https://openalex.org/W2103595811,"Ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE), a sphingomyelin analog, is a major sphingolipid in invertebrates and parasites, whereas only trace amounts are present in mammalian cells. In this study, mushroom-derived proteins of the aegerolysin family—pleurotolysin A2 (PlyA2; K(D) = 12 nM), ostreolysin (Oly; K(D) = 1.3 nM), and erylysin A (EryA; K(D) = 1.3 nM)—strongly associated with CPE/cholesterol (Chol)-containing membranes, whereas their low affinity to sphingomyelin/Chol precluded establishment of the binding kinetics. Binding specificity was determined by multilamellar liposome binding assays, supported bilayer assays, and solid-phase studies against a series of neutral and negatively charged lipid classes mixed 1:1 with Chol or phosphatidylcholine. No cross-reactivity was detected with phosphatidylethanolamine. Only PlyA2 also associated with CPE, independent of Chol content (K(D) = 41 μM), rendering it a suitable tool for visualizing CPE in lipid-blotting experiments and biologic samples from sterol auxotrophic organisms. Visualization of CPE enrichment in the CNS of Drosophila larvae (by PlyA2) and in the bloodstream form of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei (by EryA) by fluorescence imaging demonstrated the versatility of aegerolysin family proteins as efficient tools for detecting and visualizing CPE."
https://openalex.org/W611658247,"Hendra virus (HeV) is a lethal zoonotic agent that emerged in 1994 in Australia. Pteropid bats (flying-foxes) are the natural reservoir. To date, HeV has spilled over from flying-foxes to horses on 51 known occasions, and from infected horses to close-contact humans on seven occasions. We undertook screening of archived bat tissues for HeV by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Tissues were tested from 310 bats including 295 Pteropodiformes and 15 Vespertilioniformes. HeV was detected in 20 individual flying-foxes (6.4%) from various tissues including spleen, kidney, liver, lung, placenta and blood components. Detection was significantly higher in Pteropus Alecto and P. conspicillatus, identifying species as a risk factor for infection. Further, our findings indicate that HeV has a predilection for the spleen, suggesting this organ plays an important role in HeV infection. The lack of detections in the foetal tissues of HeV-positive females suggests that vertical transmission is not a regular mode of transmission in naturally infected flying-foxes, and that placental and foetal tissues are not a major source of infection for horses. A better understanding of HeV tissue tropism will strengthen management of the risk of spillover from flying-foxes to horses and ultimately humans."

The aim of this study was to assess the impact on the HDL protein cargo of the intake of virgin olive oil (VOO) and two functional VOOs, enriched with their own PCs (FVOO) or complemented with thyme PCs (FVOOT), in hypercholesterolemic subjects. Eligible volunteers were recruited from the IMIM-Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (Spain) from April 2012 to September 2012. Thirty-three hypercholesterolemic participants (total cholesterol >200 mg/dL; 19 men and 14 women; aged 35 to 80 years) were randomized in the double-blind, controlled, cross-over VOHF clinical trial. The subjects received for 3 weeks 25 mL/day of: VOO, FVOO, or FVOOT. Using a quantitative proteomics approach, 127 HDL-associated proteins were identified. Among these, 15 were commonly differently expressed after the three VOO interventions compared to baseline, with specific changes observed for each intervention. The 15 common proteins were mainly involved in the following pathways: LXR/RXR activation, acute phase response, and atherosclerosis. The three VOOs were well tolerated by all participants. Consumption of VOO, or phenol-enriched VOOs, has an impact on the HDL proteome in a cardioprotective mode by up-regulating proteins related to cholesterol homeostasis, protection against oxidation and blood coagulation while down-regulating proteins implicated in acute-phase response, lipid transport, and immune response. The common observed protein expression modifications after the three VOOs indicate a major matrix effect.International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials ISRCTN77500181."
https://openalex.org/W1139328013,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is known to play a pivotal role in a diverse range of biological systems including modulation of fibrosis in several organs. The precise role of TGF-β/Smad signaling in the progression of bladder fibrosis secondary to partial bladder outlet obstruction (PBOO) is yet to be conclusively. Using a rat PBOO model, we investigated TGF-β1 expression and exaimined whether sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) could inhibit TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway activation and ameliorate bladder fibrosis. Forty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham operation group (n = 16), PBOO operation without STS treatment group (n = 16) and PBOO operation with STS treatment group (n = 16). Thirty-two rats underwent the operative procedure to create PBOO and subsequently received intraperitoneal injections of STS (10 mg/kg/d; n = 16) or vehicle (n = 16) two days after the surgery. Sham surgery was conducted on 16 rats, which received intraperitoneal vehicle injection two days later. In each of the three groups, an equal number of rats were sacrificed at weeks 4 and 8 after the PBOO or sham operation. The TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway was analyzed using western blotting, immunohistochemical staining and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). One-way analysis of variance was conducted to draw statistical inferences. At 4 and 8 weeks, the expression of TGF-β1 and phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 in STS-treated PBOO rats was significantly lower than in the PBOO rats not treated with STS. Alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen I and collagen III expression at 4 and 8 weeks post PBOO was lower in STS-treated PBOO rats when compared to that in PBOO rats not treated with STS. Our findings indicate that STS ameliorates bladder fibrosis by inhibiting TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway activation, and may prove to be a potential therapeutic measure for preventing bladder fibrosis secondary to PBOO operation."
https://openalex.org/W1470296847,"The prevalent human ΔF508 mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is associated with reduced bone formation and bone loss in mice. The molecular mechanisms by which the ΔF508-CFTR mutation causes alterations in bone formation are poorly known. In this study, we analyzed the osteoblast phenotype in ΔF508-CFTR mice and characterized the signaling mechanisms underlying this phenotype. Ex vivo studies showed that the ΔF508-CFTR mutation negatively impacted the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells into osteoblasts and the activity of osteoblasts, demonstrating that the ΔF508-CFTR mutation alters both osteoblast differentiation and function. Treatment with a CFTR corrector rescued the abnormal collagen gene expression in ΔF508-CFTR osteoblasts. Mechanistic analysis revealed that NF-κB signaling and transcriptional activity were increased in mutant osteoblasts. Functional studies showed that the activation of NF-κB transcriptional activity in mutant osteoblasts resulted in increased β-catenin phosphorylation, reduced osteoblast β-catenin expression, and altered expression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB activity or activation of canonical Wnt signaling rescued Wnt target gene expression and corrected osteoblast differentiation and function in bone marrow stromal cells and osteoblasts from ΔF508-CFTR mice. Overall, the results show that the ΔF508-CFTR mutation impairs osteoblast differentiation and function as a result of overactive NF-κB and reduced Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, the data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB or activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling can rescue the abnormal osteoblast differentiation and function induced by the prevalent ΔF508-CFTR mutation, suggesting novel therapeutic strategies to correct the osteoblast dysfunctions in cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1601331762,"Plasma membrane hyperpolarization is crucial for mammalian sperm to acquire acrosomal responsiveness during capacitation. Among the signaling events leading to mammalian sperm capacitation, the immediate activation of protein kinase A plays a pivotal role, promoting the subsequent stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation that associates with fertilizing capacity. We have shown previously that mice deficient in the tyrosine kinase cSrc are infertile and exhibit improper cauda epididymis development. It is therefore not clear whether lack of sperm functionality is due to problems in epididymal maturation or to the absence of cSrc in sperm. To further address this problem, we investigated the kinetics of cSrc activation using anti-Tyr(P)-416-cSrc antibodies that only recognize active cSrc. Our results provide evidence that cSrc is activated downstream of PKA and that inhibition of its activity blocks the capacitation-induced hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane without blocking the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation that accompanies capacitation. In addition, we show that cSrc inhibition also blocks the agonist-induced acrosome reaction and that this inhibition is overcome by pharmacological hyperpolarization. Considering that capacitation-induced hyperpolarization is mediated by SLO3, we evaluated the action of cSrc inhibitors on the heterologously expressed SLO3 channel. Our results indicate that, similar to SLO1 K+ channels, cSrc blockers significantly decreased SLO3-mediated currents. Together, these results are consistent with findings showing that hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane is necessary and sufficient to prepare the sperm for the acrosome reaction and suggest that changes in sperm membrane potential are mediated by cSrc activation.

Mammalian sperm are unable to fertilize the egg immediately after ejaculation. They need to undergo a series of physiological modifications inside the female reproductive tract, collectively known as capacitation, to gain fertilization competence. This capacity to fertilize the egg is the hallmark of capacitation and associates with the onset of a vigorous motility pattern (i.e. hyperactivation) and acrosomal responsiveness (i.e. the capacity to undergo the acrosome reaction upon stimulation) (1Visconti P.E.

In mammals, the capacitation process can be mimicked in vitro by sperm incubation in standard culture medium containing Ca2+, HCO3−, energy sources, and a cholesterol acceptor that is usually BSA. Upon sperm exposure to these conditions, one of the first signaling events observed is a fast increase of intracellular cAMP concentration with the consequent PKA activation (2Harrison R.A.

Interestingly, even though intracellular cAMP increases almost instantaneously after sperm exposure to capacitating conditions, the promotion of tyrosine phosphorylation associated with sperm capacitation and, more importantly, the capacity to fertilize the egg are acquired ∼45 min later in mouse sperm (10Visconti P.E.

Despite major advances achieved in the field of sperm capacitation, the molecular basis of this delay has not yet been resolved. membrane potential Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases enhanced GFP. Considering the relevance of the capacitation-induced increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, it is surprising that very little is known about the tyrosine kinases mediating this process. Work from several laboratories has shown the presence of members of the Src family of kinases (SFK), in mouse sperm: cSrc (3Krapf D. Arcelay E. Wertheimer E.V. Sanjay A. Pilder S.H. Salicioni A.M.

However, recent work from our group using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches has shown that, although SFK inhibitors affect phosphorylation by up-regulation of Ser/Thr phosphatases, SFKs are not directly involved in the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation observed during sperm capacitation that follows PKA activation. In particular, our studies using cSrc KO mouse models have demonstrated that lack of cSrc did not block the onset of tyrosine phosphorylation (3Krapf D. Arcelay E. Wertheimer E.V. Sanjay A. Pilder S.H. Salicioni A.M. Visconti P.E. Inhibition of Ser/Thr phosphatases induces capacitation-associated signaling in the presence of Src kinase inhibitors.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7977-7985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Despite the normal increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, sperm from these mice are infertile because of a combined reproductive phenotype. First, the cauda epididymis region in these mice does not develop properly, and second, in the absence of cSrc, sperm motility is reduced significantly. Because of the problems observed in the epididymis, the sperm phenotype is difficult to pinpoint. Is the problem in sperm motility the result of a direct role of cSrc in sperm or is it due to problems of these mice in epididymal maturation? Therefore, in this work, to directly address the role of cSrc in sperm, we followed cSrc activation using anti-phospho cSrc (Tyr(P)-416-Src), which only recognized the active form of the SFK. Using this approach, we show that cSrc is activated 10–15 min downstream of PKA activation and that cSrc activation is both necessary and precedes the capacitation-induced Em hyperpolarization. Consequently, considering the need and sufficiency of hyperpolarization for a functional acrosome reaction, we have also shown that cSrc inhibition blocks the acrosomal exocytosis. Finally, we present evidence showing that SLO3 channels expressed in a heterologous system are blocked by cSrc inhibitors. Chemicals were obtained from the following sources.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA) and Amersham Biosciences (GE Healthcare), respectively. Cauda epididymal mouse sperm were collected from BL6 young adult male mice (8–13 weeks old) and sacrificed under supervision of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Facultad de Ciencias Bioquímicas y Farmacéuticas de Rosario (UNR). Each minced cauda epididymis was placed in 500 μl of a modified Krebs-Ringer medium (Whitten's HEPES-buffered medium containing 5 mg/ml BSA, Ref. 14Visconti P.E. Johnson L.R. Oyaski M. Fornés M. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Regulation, localization, and anchoring of protein kinase A subunits during mouse sperm capacitation.Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) containing 100 mm NaCl, 4.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5.4 mm glucose, 0.8 mm pyruvic acid, 4.8 mm lactic acid; 2.4 mm Ca2+, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). After 10 min, epididymides were removed, and the suspension was adjusted with non-capacitating medium to a final concentration of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml. For capacitation, 15 mm NaHCO3 was added, and sperm was incubated at 37 °C for at least 1 h at 2 × 106 cells/ml. To test the effect of the different inhibitors of capacitation, sperm were preincubated with inhibitors in non-capacitating medium for 15 min prior to the beginning of the capacitating period. After treatment, sperm were collected by centrifugation, washed in 1 ml of TBS, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (15Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar) without β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 3 min. After centrifugation, 5% β-mercaptoethanol was added to the supernatants and boiled again for 5 min. Protein extracts equivalent to 1–2 × 106 sperm/lane were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) at 250 mA for 60 min on ice. Membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS). For anti-Tyr(P) and anti-pPKA immunodetections, membranes were blocked with 3% BSA (Sigma) in T-TBS. Antibodies were diluted in T-TBS as follows: 1/10,000 for anti-Tyr(P) (clone 4G10), 1/5000 for anti-pPKA (clone 100G7E), 1/1000 for anti-Fyn, anti-Src, and anti-pSrc antibodies (clones GD11, 32G6, and D49G4, respectively), and 1/10,000 for anti-tubulin (clone E7) and anti-actin. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1/10,000 in T-TBS and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. When necessary, PVDF membranes were stripped at 60 °C for 15 min in 2% SDS, 0.74% β-mercaptoethanol, and 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.5) and washed six times for 5 min each time in T-TBS. In all experiments, molecular masses were expressed in kilodaltons. After sperm incubation under the appropriate conditions, samples were centrifuged at 1700 × g for 1 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors), incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 2500 × g. Supernatants were incubated with anti-Src (clone 32G6) or anti-Fyn (Cell Signaling Technology, catalog no. 4023, 1/200 antibody for 1 × 107 cells in a final volume of 500 μl) and anti-tubulin antibodies (clone E7, 1/200) as a negative control for 2 h at room temperature with constant rocking. After adding 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), the reactions were rocked further for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complex was recovered by centrifugation, washed four times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and subjected to SDS/PAGE and Western blot analysis. To avoid immunoreactive signals from denatured IgGs used for immunoprecipitation, a monoclonal secondary HRP mouse anti-native rabbit IgG was used (clone RabT-50, Sigma). Sperm were incubated under capacitating conditions for 60 min in the presence or absence of different SFK inhibitor concentrations. Progesterone (20 μm) was then added and incubated for another 30 min. The evaluation of the acrosomal status was performed by two alternative mechanisms. In one of them, sperm from transgenic male mice (BDF1-Tg (CAG-mtDsRed2, Acr-EGFP) RBGS0020sb) displaying acrosomal vesicles expressing green EGFP fluorescence and midpieces (mitochondria) expressing red Ds-Red2 fluorescence were used (16Hasuwa H. Muro Y. Ikawa M. Kato N. Tsujimoto Y. Okabe M. Transgenic mouse sperm that have green acrosome and red mitochondria allow visualization of sperm and their acrosome reaction in vivo.Exp. Anim. 2010; 59: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this case, sperm were analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACSCanto II flow cytometer, BD Biosciences) after adding propidium iodide to the sperm suspension to discriminate dead cells (6Escoffier J. Krapf D. Navarrete F. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. Flow cytometry analysis reveals a decrease in intracellular sodium during sperm capacitation.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 473-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A 515- to 545-nm band path filter and 650-nm-long path filters were used for GFP and propidium iodide, respectively. For the second mechanism, WT mouse sperm were used. After progesterone stimulation, these cells were seeded on 8-well glass slides. After air-drying, sperm were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS (for times for 5 min each time), and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Sperm were then treated with 10% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with PBS containing 1% BSA and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated peanut agglutinin (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. Before mounting with Slow-Fade Light reagents (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), samples were washed with PBS (four times for 5 min each time). Epifluorescence microscopy was performed using a BH2 Olympus microscope. Differential interference contrast images were taken in parallel and served as the control for sperm morphology. Mature sperm, at a concentration of 4 × 106 sperm in 1.7 ml, from the caudal epididymis were capacitated as described above. After incubation for the indicated period, the potential-sensitive dye DiSC3-(5), which has been successfully used in mammalian sperm, was added to a final concentration of 1 μm, and sperm were incubated for 2 min. No mitochondrial uncouplers were used because their contribution to the resting potential has been determined to be insignificant (17Chávez J.C. de la Vega-Beltrán J.L. Escoffier J. Visconti P.E. Treviño C.L. Darszon A. Salkoff L. Santi C.M. Ion permeabilities in mouse sperm reveal an external trigger for SLO3-dependent hyperpolarization.PloS ONE. 2013; 8e60578Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The sperm were transferred to a gently stirred cuvette at 37 °C, and the fluorescence was monitored with a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer at 620/670 nm excitation/emission wavelength. Recordings were initiated when steady-state fluorescence was reached (approximately 1 min). Calibration was performed by adding 1 μm valinomycin and sequential additions of KCl as described previously (17Chávez J.C. de la Vega-Beltrán J.L. Escoffier J. Visconti P.E. Treviño C.L. Darszon A. Salkoff L. Santi C.M. Ion permeabilities in mouse sperm reveal an external trigger for SLO3-dependent hyperpolarization.PloS ONE. 2013; 8e60578Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The final sperm membrane potential was obtained by linearly interpolating the theoretical Em values against arbitrary fluorescence units of each trace. This internal calibration for each determination compensates for variables that influence the absolute fluorescence values. Oocytes were harvested from adult female Xenopus laevis as described previously (18Yuan A. Dourado M. Butler A. Walton N. Wei A. Salkoff L. SLO-2, a K+ channel with an unusual Cl− dependence.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were injected with 14–20 ng of mouse SLO3 (mSLO3) cRNA using a Nanoject II Drummond Scientific nanoinjector (Broomall, PA). Injected oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in ND96 complete medium (ND96 medium plus 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml to 100 μg/ml). The ND96 medium consisted of 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH. Whole cell currents from mock control and injected oocytes were recorded 3–5 days after injection using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp with an Oocyte Clamp OC-725C amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp.). Whole cell currents were recorded in ND96 solution. Recordings were obtained by digitizing at 10 kHz and low-pass filtering at 1 kHz. Electrodes were made with borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments), pulled with a Sutter Instrument Co. P-87 pipette puller, and filled with 3 m KCl. Data were analyzed using pClamp 9 (Molecular Devices) and Origin 6.1 (Microcal Software). Paired Student's t test was used to compare mean values between control and tested groups. The difference between mean values of multiple groups was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Holm-Šidák test. Statistical significances are indicated in the figure legends. Members of the SFK family require phosphorylation in residue Tyr-416 (known as Tyr-416 for chicken cSrc and corresponding to Tyr-424 in mouse cSrc or its analogue residue in other members of the SFK) to undergo activation and to allow the substrate to gain access to an open-state catalytic site of the active kinase (19Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Selected glimpses into the activation and function of Src kinase.Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 20Roskoski Jr., R. Src kinase regulation by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Therefore, antibodies against the phosphorylated state of Tyr-416-SFK (hereafter named Tyr-416-Src) can be used to follow activation of members of the SFK family. As expected, the presence of the cSrc inhibitors SU6656 and SKI606 in the capacitating medium successfully blocked phosphorylation of Tyr-416-Src with an IC50 of ∼100–300 nm and maximum effects of 300 nm and 1 μm for SKI606 and SU6656, respectively (Figs. 1, A and B, first and second panels). Although the SFK detected was clearly inhibited, and consistent with our previously published results (3Krapf D. Arcelay E. Wertheimer E.V. Sanjay A. Pilder S.H. Salicioni A.M. Visconti P.E. Inhibition of Ser/Thr phosphatases induces capacitation-associated signaling in the presence of Src kinase inhibitors.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7977-7985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), these low SKI606 and SU6656 concentrations did not have any effect on either tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm proteins associated with capacitation (Fig. 1, A and B, third panels) or PKA substrate phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B, fourth panels). The requirement of Tyr-416 phosphorylation (or the respective conserved site) is common to all members of the SFK family. Therefore, the antibody used to detect Tyr(P)-416-Src might recognize analogue sites in other SFK members. To validate the use of anti Tyr(P)-416-Src for detection of cSrc in its Tyr-416-phosphorylated form in whole sperm cell extracts, immunoprecipitations were carried out using a previously validated monoclonal antibody (clone 32G6) (3Krapf D. Arcelay E. Wertheimer E.V. Sanjay A. Pilder S.H. Salicioni A.M. Visconti P.E. Inhibition of Ser/Thr phosphatases induces capacitation-associated signaling in the presence of Src kinase inhibitors.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7977-7985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, anti Tyr(P)-416-Src antibodies detected an immunoprecipitated protein from capacitated sperm at the expected molecular weight of cSrc. The immunoprecipitation of cSrc from non-capacitated sperm was confirmed by using a second validated specific anti-cSrc antibody (clone GD11) (Fig. 2A, center panel). The use of a secondary antibody that specifically detects native IgGs avoided detection of denatured IgGs used for immunoprecipitation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Regarding the presence of other SFK members in mouse sperm, Fyn has been reported recently (21Luo J. Gupta V. Kern B. Tash J.S. Sanchez G. Blanco G. Kinsey W.H. Role of FYN kinase in spermatogenesis: defects characteristic of Fyn-null sperm in mice.Biol. Reprod. 2012; 86: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to have an active role in spermatogenesis. To analyze the possible activation of Fyn during capacitation, the anti Tyr-416-Src was used because it cross-reacts with all members of the SFK family when phosphorylated at the analogous site (Tyr-420-Fyn). Immunodetections were performed with immunoprecipitation assays using anti-Fyn-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2B, two immunoreactive proteins were obtained. The higher molecular weight protein was of the expected size. However, no signal was obtained when analyzed with anti-Tyr(P)-416-Src, suggesting that Fyn is not phosphorylated on the analogue Tyr-416 residue or that this antibody does not recognize the equivalent position in this SFK family member. The immunoreactive signal in the total extract is expected to correspond to cSrc, as shown above, to be phosphorylated upon capacitation. No other members of the SFK family could be detected by Western blot analysis on non-capacitated mouse sperm extracts (Fig. 2C). Considering that PKA is fully activated at 1 min (22Harrison R.A. Rapid PKA-catalysed phosphorylation of boar sperm proteins induced by the capacitating agent bicarbonate.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2004; 67: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and plays a pivotal role in many aspects of sperm capacitation (23Buffone M.G. Wertheimer E.V. Visconti P.E. Krapf D. Central role of soluble adenylyl cyclase and cAMP in sperm physiology.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1842: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we aimed to analyze the possible regulation of cSrc activity by PKA. Our results indicate that, in medium devoid of HCO3−, which does not support capacitation or PKA activation, phosphorylation of Tyr-416-cSrc was not observed (Fig. 3A). However, when the incubation medium was supplemented with the permeable PKA agonist dibutyryl cyclic AMP and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine, cSrc activation was observed (Fig. 3A). Moreover, when sperm were incubated in capacitating medium, phosphorylation of Tyr-416 was blocked by two independent PKA inhibitors. Both the stearated (membrane-permeable) PKA inhibitor PKA inhibitor peptide (which binds to the protein-substrate site, inhibiting the catalytic PKA subunit) and the PKA inhibitor H-89 (which competes for the ATP pocket on the catalytic PKA subunit) (Figs. 3A) abrogated cSrc activation (see Fig. 3, B and C, for pPKAs and Tyr(P) controls). Moreover, the effect of H-89 is expected to be PKA-specific because 10 μm of H-89 effectively blocked phosphorylation of cSrc (Fig. 3D), a concentration shown to specifically affect PKA (3Krapf D. Arcelay E. Wertheimer E.V. Sanjay A. Pilder S.H. Salicioni A.M. Visconti P.E. Inhibition of Ser/Thr phosphatases induces capacitation-associated signaling in the presence of Src kinase inhibitors.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7977-7985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In a time curve analysis, it was observed that phosphorylation of Tyr-416-cSrc starts 15 min after the beginning of capacitation and reaches a maximum at 30 min, showing-steady levels thereafter (Fig. 3E). This kinetics are clearly delayed compared with phosphorylation of PKA substrates (Fig. 3F) but faster than the onset of tyrosine phosphorylation associated with sperm capacitation (Fig. 3G). Together, these data indicate that PKA activation is upstream of cSrc activation. Aiming to investigate the biological effect of cSrc blockade on sperm physiology, motility and acrosome reaction were evaluated. Although no effect was observed on hyperactivation, a low concentrations of both SU6656 and SKI606, which effectively blocked activation of cSrc without disturbing tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4A), hampered the acquisition of acrosomal responsiveness to progesterone (Fig. 4B), measured using peanut agglutinin-FITC staining of intact acrosomes. Similar results were obtained by flow cytometry (Fig. 4C) using sperm from Acr-GFP transgenic mice (Fig. 4D), which display green fluorescent acrosomes when intact without staining requirements (16Hasuwa H.

Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) sampling on shallow rocky reef (15 - 25 m) was conducted annually from 2002 until 2014 in the Austral-winter, covering the decade after these marine park zones were established (2002). Additional deeper sites (25 - 40 m) were sampled in 2010-2011 to assess if findings were more-broadly applicable. Lengths were measured using stereo-BRUVs from 2011-2014. Snapper were significantly more abundant in SZ overall and in most years compared with the other two management types, which did not significantly differ. Snapper rapidly increased after 2 - 3 years protection in all management types, especially SZ. Snapper were present on more SZ deployments than HPZ and Outside after the same period. The positive SZ response in snapper abundance on shallower reef was also found at a broader spatial scale on deeper sites. Again the two fished management types did not show significant differences among each other. There was considerable variation in snapper abundance between years, with strong peaks in 2005, 2009 and 2014 especially in SZ. Abundances remained higher in SZ in the year or two following a strong peak, but decreased to similar abundances to fished areas before the next peak. Snapper length frequency distribution significantly differed between SZ and both fished management types, with more larger snapper within SZ including a higher proportion (58%) that were legal-sized (>25.7 cm FL). HPZ and Outside did not significantly differ from each other, and were dominated by individuals below legal size. Overall, SZ's have positively influenced abundance and length of snapper on these subtropical rocky reefs."

By binding to the decoding site of helix44 of the small subunit RNA of the bacterial ribosome, the aminoglycoside antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis, cause misreading, or obstruct peptidyl-tRNA translocation. Although aminoglycosides bind helix69 of the bacterial large subunit RNA as well, little is known about their interaction with the homologous human helix69. To probe the role this binding event plays in toxicity, changes to thermal stability, base stacking, and conformation upon aminoglycoside binding to the human cytoplasmic helix69 were compared with those of the human mitochondrial and Escherichia coli helix69. Surprisingly, binding of gentamicin and kanamycin A to the chemically synthesized terminal hairpins of the human cytoplasmic, human mitochondrial, and E. coli helix69 revealed similar dissociation constants (1.3–1.7 and 4.0–5.4 μm, respectively). In addition, aminoglycoside binding enhanced conformational stability of the human mitochondrial helix69 by increasing base stacking. Proton one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR suggested significant and specific conformational changes of human mitochondrial and E. coli helix69 upon aminoglycoside binding, as compared with human cytoplasmic helix69. The conformational changes and similar aminoglycoside binding affinities observed for human mitochondrial helix69 and E. coli helix69, as well as the increase in structural stability shown for the former, suggest that this binding event is important to understanding aminoglycoside toxicity."

We used microhistological analyses and hormone levels in feces to determine sex-specific late-winter diets, pregnancy rates, group composition, and endocrine-based measures of physiological and nutritional stress. Lichens, which are highly digestible but contain little protein, dominated the diet (> 68%) but were less prevalent in the diets of pregnant females as compared to non-pregnant females and males. The amount of lichens in the diets of pregnant females decreased at higher latitudes and as winter progressed. Pregnancy rates (82.1%, 95% CI = 76.0 - 88.1%) of adult cows were within the expected range for a declining herd, while pregnancy status was not associated with lichen abundance in the diet. Most groups (80%) were of mixed sex. Male: female ratios (62:100) were not skewed enough to affect the decline. Levels of hormones indicating nutritional stress were detected in areas of low habitat quality and at higher latitudes. Levels of hormones indicated that physiological stress was greatest for pregnant cows, which faced the increasing demands of gestation in late winter. These fecal-based measures of diet and stress provided contextual information for the potential mechanisms of the ongoing decline. Non-invasive techniques, such as monitoring diets, pregnancy rates, sex ratios and stress levels from fecal samples, will become increasingly important as monitoring tools as the industrial footprint continues to expand in the Arctic."
https://openalex.org/W628069091,"Oligolectic bees collect pollen from a few plants within a genus or family to rear their offspring, and are known to rely on visual and olfactory floral cues to recognize host plants. However, studies investigating whether oligolectic bees recognize distinct host plants by using shared floral cues are scarce. In the present study, we investigated in a comparative approach the visual and olfactory floral cues of six Campanula species, of which only Campanula lactiflora has never been reported as a pollen source of the oligolectic bee Ch. rapunculi. We hypothesized that the flowers of Campanula species visited by Ch. rapunculi share visual (i.e. color) and/or olfactory cues (scents) that give them a host-specific signature. To test this hypothesis, floral color and scent were studied by spectrophotometric and chemical analyses, respectively. Additionally, we performed bioassays within a flight cage to test the innate color preference of Ch. rapunculi. Our results show that Campanula flowers reflect the light predominantly in the UV-blue/blue bee-color space and that Ch. rapunculi displays a strong innate preference for these two colors. Furthermore, we recorded spiroacetals in the floral scent of all Campanula species, but Ca. lactiflora. Spiroacetals, rarely found as floral scent constituents but quite common among Campanula species, were recently shown to play a key function for host-flower recognition by Ch. rapunculi. We conclude that Campanula species share some visual and olfactory floral cues, and that neurological adaptations (i.e. vision and olfaction) of Ch. rapunculi innately drive their foraging flights toward host flowers. The significance of our findings for the evolution of pollen diet breadth in bees is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W629715658,"We observed that oleuropein, the main constituent of the leaves and unprocessed olive drupes of Olea europaea, protected mice from high-fat diet-induced adiposity by up-regulation of genes involved in Wnt10b-mediated signaling in adipose tissue. The activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway is also well established to positively regulate the anagen phase of hair growth cycle in mice skin. Methodology and Principal Findings Oleuropein promoted cultured human follicle dermal papilla cell proliferation and induced LEF1 and Cyc-D1 mRNA expression and β-catenin protein expression in dermal papilla cells. Nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in dermal papilla cells was observed after oleuropein treatment. Topical application of oleuropein (0.4 mg/mouse/day) to C57BL/6N mice accelerated the hair-growth induction and increased the size of hair follicles in telogenic mouse skin. The oleuropein-treated mouse skin showed substantial upregulation of Wnt10b, FZDR1, LRP5, LEF1, Cyc-D1, IGF-1, KGF, HGF, and VEGF mRNA expression and β-catenin protein expression. Conclusions and Significance These results demonstrate that topical oleuroepin administration induced anagenic hair growth in telogenic C57BL/6N mouse skin. The hair-growth promoting effect of oleuropein in mice appeared to be associated with the stimulation of the Wnt10b/β-catenin signaling pathway and the upregulation of IGF-1, KGF, HGF, and VEGF gene expression in mouse skin tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1143695213,"Flavonoids are important components of 'functional foods', with beneficial effects on cardiovascular function. The present study was designed to investigate whether licochalcone D (LD) could be a cardioprotective agent in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and to shed light on its possible mechanism. Compared with the I/R group, LD treatment enhanced myocardial function (increased LVDP, dp/dtmax, dp/dtmin, HR and CR) and suppressed cardiac injury (decreased LDH, CK and myocardial infarct size). Moreover, LD treatment reversed the I/R-induced cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, resulting in a significant decrease in proinflammatory factors and an increase in antioxidant capacity in I/R myocardial tissue. The mechanisms underlying the antiapoptosis, antiinflammation and antioxidant effects were related to the activation of the AKT pathway and to the blockage of the NF-κB/p65 and p38 MAPK pathways in the I/R-injured heart. Additionally, LD treatment markedly activated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and reduced nitric oxide (NO) production. The findings indicated that LD had real cardioprotective potential and provided support for the use of LD in myocardial I/R injury."
https://openalex.org/W2107624795,"Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinases play a prominent role in multiple cellular processes, including: cell proliferation, differentiation, cell survival, stress response, and cell adhesion and migration, among others. And when deregulated by mutations, overexpression, and/or the arrival of faulty incoming signals, its hyperactivity contributes to the development of hematological and solid tumors. c-Src is a prototypical member of this family of kinases, which is highly regulated by a set of phosphorylation events. Other factor contributing to the regulation of Src activity appears to be mediated by the Ca2+ signal generated in cells by different effectors, where the Ca2+-receptor protein calmodulin (CaM) plays a key role. In this report we demonstrate that CaM directly interacts with Src in both Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent manners in vitro and in living cells, and that the CaM antagonist N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7) inhibits the activation of this kinase induced by the upstream activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), in human carcinoma epidermoide A431 cells, and by hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress, in both A431 cells and human breast adenocarcinoma SK-BR-3 cells. Furthermore, we show that the Ca2+/CaM complex strongly activates the auto-phosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src toward exogenous substrates, but most relevantly and for the first time, we demonstrate that Ca2+-free CaM (apo-CaM) exerts a far higher activatory action on Src auto-phosphorylation and kinase activity toward exogenous substrates than the one exerted by the Ca2+/CaM complex. This suggests that a transient increase in the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+ is not an absolute requirement for CaM-mediated activation of Src in living cells, and that a direct regulation of Src by apo-CaM could be inferred."
https://openalex.org/W2177792457,"Aims Some environmental insults, such as fine particulate matter (PM) exposure, significantly impair the function of stem cells. However, it is unknown if PM exposure could affect the population of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs). The present study was to investigate the effects of PM on BMSCs population and related mechanism(s). Main Metheods PM was intranasally distilled into male C57BL/6 mice for one month. Flow cytometry with antibodies for BMSCs, Annexin V and BrdU ware used to determine the number of BMSCs and the levels of their apoptosis and proliferation in vivo. Phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt) level was determined in the BM cells with western blotting. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation was quantified using flow cytometry analysis. To determine the role of PM-induced ROS in BMSCs population, proliferation, and apotosis, experiments were repeated using N-acetylcysteine (NAC)-treated wild type mice or a triple transgenic mouse line with overexpression of antioxidant network (AON) composed of superoxide dismutase (SOD)1, SOD3, and glutathione peroxidase-1 with decreased in vivo ROS production. Key Findings PM treatment significantly reduced BMSCs population in association with increased ROS formation, decreased P-Akt level, and inhibition of proliferation of BMSCs without induction of apoptosis. NAC treatment or AON overexpression with reduced ROS formation effectively prevented PM-induced reduction of BMSCs population and proliferation with partial recovery of P-Akt level. Significance PM exposure significantly decreased the population of BMSCs due to diminished proliferation via ROS-mediated mechanism (could be partially via inhibition of Akt signaling)."
https://openalex.org/W613404763,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a widespread disease, with no curative therapies available. Recent findings suggest a key role of NO and sGC-cGMP signaling for the pathogenesis of the disease. Previous data suggest a downregulation/inactivation of the cGMP producing soluble guanylate cyclase, and sGC stimulation prevented cigarette smoke-induced emphysema and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in mice. We thus aimed to investigate if the inhibition of the cGMP degrading phosphodiesterase (PDE)5 has similar effects. Results were compared to the effects of a PDE 4 inhibitor (cAMP elevating) and a combination of both.C57BL6/J mice were chronically exposed to cigarette smoke and in parallel either treated with Tadalafil (PDE5 inhibitor), Piclamilast (PDE4 inhibitor) or both. Functional measurements (lung compliance, hemodynamics) and structural investigations (alveolar and vascular morphometry) as well as the heart ratio were determined after 6 months of tobacco smoke exposure. In addition, the number of alveolar macrophages in the respective lungs was counted.Preventive treatment with Tadalafil, Piclamilast or a combination of both almost completely prevented the development of emphysema, the increase in lung compliance, tidal volume, structural remodeling of the lung vasculature, right ventricular systolic pressure, and right ventricular hypertrophy induced by cigarette smoke exposure. Single, but not combination treatment prevented or reduced smoke-induced increase in alveolar macrophages.Cigarette smoke-induced emphysema and PH could be prevented by inhibition of the phosphodiesterases 4 and 5 in mice."

In this study, eight maintainer lines and nine restorer lines were used to obtain 72 crosses for analyzing the general combining ability (GCA) and special combining ability (SCA) for seven agronomic and yield characters including plant height (PH), spike length excluding awns (SL), inter-node length (IL), spikes per plant (SP), thousand kernel weight (TKW), kernel weight per plant (KWP) and dry matter weight per plant (DWP). The results showed that GCA was significantly different among parents and SCA was also significantly different among crosses. The performance of hybrid was significantly correlated with the sum of female and male GCA (TGCA), SCA and heterosis. Hu1154 A, Mian684 A, 86F098 A, 8036 R and 8041 R were excellent parents with greater general combining ability.

Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis is a promising prevention approach; however, clinical trials among young women using daily or coitally-dependent products have found low adherence. Antiretroviral-containing vaginal microbicide rings, which release medication over a month or longer, may reduce these adherence challenges.ASPIRE (A Study to Prevent Infection with a Ring for Extended Use) is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing the safety and effectiveness of a vaginal ring containing the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor dapivirine for prevention of HIV-1 infection. We describe the baseline characteristics of African women enrolled in the ASPIRE trial.Between August 2012 and June 2014, 5516 women were screened and 2629 HIV-1 seronegative women between 18-45 years of age were enrolled from 15 research sites in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. The median age was 26 years (IQR 22-31) and the majority (59%) were unmarried. Nearly 100% of participants reported having a primary sex partner in the prior three months but 43% did not know the HIV-1 status of their primary partner; 17% reported additional concurrent partners. Nearly two-thirds (64%) reported having disclosed to primary partners about planned vaginal ring use in the trial. Sexually transmitted infections were prevalent: 12% had Chlamydia trachomatis, 7% Trichomonas vaginalis, 4% Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and 1% syphilis.African HIV-1 seronegative women at risk of HIV -1 infection were successfully enrolled into a phase III trial of dapivirine vaginal ring for HIV-1 prevention."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether pet ownership during pregnancy and early childhood was associated with wheezing from birth to age 7 years and with lung function at age 8 years in a UK population-based birth cohort.Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) were used to investigate associations of pet ownership at six time-points from pregnancy to age 7 years with concurrent episodes of wheezing, wheezing trajectories (phenotypes) and lung function at age 8 years using logistic regression models adjusted for child's sex, maternal history of asthma/atopy, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and family adversity.4,706 children had complete data on pet ownership and wheezing. From birth to age 7 years, cat ownership was associated with an overall 6% lower odds of wheezing (OR=0.94 (0.89-0.99)). Rabbit and rodent ownership was associated with 21% (OR=1.21 (1.12-1.31)) and 11% (OR=1.11 (1.02-1.21)) higher odds of wheezing, respectively, with strongest effects evident during infancy. Rabbit and rodent ownership was positively associated with a 'persistent wheeze' phenotype. Pet ownership was not associated with lung function at age 8 years, with the exception of positive associations of rodent and bird ownership with better lung function.Cat ownership was associated with reduced risk, and rabbit and rodent ownership with increased risk, of wheezing during childhood. The mechanisms behind these differential effects warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W615578879,"White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) serve as a reservoir for bovine tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium bovis, and can be a source of infection in cattle. Vaccination with M. bovis Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) is being considered for management of bovine tuberculosis in deer. Presently, no method exists to non-invasively monitor the presence of bovine tuberculosis in deer. In this study, volatile organic compound profiles of BCG-vaccinated and non-vaccinated deer, before and after experimental challenge with M. bovis strain 95–1315, were generated using solid phase microextraction fiber head-space sampling over suspended fecal pellets with analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Chromatograms were processed using XCMS Online to characterize ion variation among treatment groups. The principal component scores resulting from significant (α = 0.05) ion responses were used to build linear discriminant analysis models. The sensitivity and specificity of these models were used to evaluate the feasibility of using this analytical approach to distinguish within group comparisons between pre- and post-M. bovis challenge: non-vaccinated male or female deer, BCG-vaccinated male deer, and the mixed gender non-vaccinated deer data. Seventeen compounds were identified in this analysis. The peak areas for these compounds were used to build a linear discriminant classification model based on principal component analysis scores to evaluate the feasibility of discriminating between fecal samples from M. bovis challenged deer, irrespective of vaccination status. The model best representing the data had a sensitivity of 78.6% and a specificity of 91.4%. The fecal head-space sampling approach presented in this pilot study provides a non-invasive method to discriminate between M. bovis challenged deer and BCG-vaccinated deer. Additionally, the technique may prove invaluable for BCG efficacy studies with free-ranging deer as well as for use as a non-invasive monitoring system for the detection of tuberculosis in captive deer and other livestock."
https://openalex.org/W635507339,"Breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of death among women. Among the major risk factors, an important role is played by familial history of BC. Germ-line mutations in BRCA1/2 genes account for most of the hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancers. Gene expression profiling studies have disclosed specific molecular signatures for BRCA1/2-related breast tumors as compared to sporadic cases, which might help diagnosis and clinical follow-up. Even though, a clear hallmark of BRCA1/2-positive BC is still lacking. Many diseases are correlated with quantitative changes of proteins in body fluids. Plasma potentially carries important information whose knowledge could help to improve early disease detection, prognosis, and response to therapeutic treatments. The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive approach finalized to improve the recovery of specific biomarkers from plasma samples of subjects affected by hereditary BC.To perform this analysis, we used samples from patients belonging to highly homogeneous population previously reported. Depletion of high abundant plasma proteins, 2D gel analysis, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and bioinformatics analysis were used into an integrated approach to investigate tumor-specific changes in the plasma proteome of BC patients and healthy family members sharing the same BRCA1 gene founder mutation (5083del19), previously reported by our group, with the aim to identify specific signatures.The comparative analysis of the experimental results led to the identification of gelsolin as the most promising biomarker.Further analyses, performed using a panel of breast cancer cell lines, allowed us to further elucidate the signaling network that might modulate the expression of gelsolin in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W655110993,"CD8+ T cells specific to caspase-cleaved antigens derived from apoptotic T cells (apoptotic epitopes) represent a principal player in chronic immune activation, which is known to amplify immunopathology in various inflammatory diseases. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship involving these autoreactive T cells, the rheumatoid arthritis immunopathology, and the response to tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor therapy. The frequency of autoreactive CD8+ T cells specific to various apoptotic epitopes, as detected by both enzyme-linked immunospot assay and dextramers of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules complexed with relevant apoptotic epitopes, was longitudinally analyzed in the peripheral blood of rheumatoid arthritis patients who were submitted to etanercept treatment (or other tumor necrosis factor inhibitors as a control). The percentage of apoptotic epitope-specific CD8+ T cells was significantly higher in rheumatoid arthritis patients than in healthy donors, and correlated with the disease activity. More important, it was significantly more elevated in responders to tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor therapy than in non-responders before the start of therapy; it significantly dropped only in the former following therapy. These data indicate that apoptotic epitope-specific CD8+ T cells may be involved in rheumatoid arthritis immunopathology through the production of inflammatory cytokines and that they may potentially represent a predictive biomarker of response to tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor therapy to validate in a larger cohort of patients."
https://openalex.org/W651675986,"Esca disease has become a major threat for viticulture. Phaeoacremonium aleophilum is considered a pioneer of the esca complex pathosystem, but its colonisation behaviour inside plants remains poorly investigated.In this study, P. aleophilum::gfp7 colonisation was assessed six and twelve weeks post-inoculation in two different types of tissues: in the node and the internode of one year-old rooted cuttings of Cabernet Sauvignon. These processes of colonisation were compared with the colonisation by the wild-type strain using a non-specific lectin probe Alexa Fluor 488-WGA.Data showed that six weeks post-inoculation of the internode, the fungus had colonised the inoculation point, the bark and xylem fibres. Bark, pith and xylem fibres were strongly colonised by the fungus twelve weeks post-inoculation and it can progress up to 8 mm from the point of inoculation using pith, bark and fibres. P. aleophilum was additionally detected in the lumen of xylem vessels in which tyloses blocked its progression. Different plant responses in specific tissues were additionally visualised. Inoculation of nodes led to restricted colonisation of P. aleophilum and this colonisation was associated with a plant response six weeks post-inoculation. The fungus was however detected in xylem vessels, bark and inside the pith twelve weeks post-inoculation.These results demonstrate that P. aleophilum colonisation can vary according to the type of tissues and the type of spread using pith, bark and fibres. Woody tissues can respond to the injury and to the presence of this fungus, and xylem fibres play a key role in the early colonisation of the internode by P. aleophilum before the fungus can colonise xylem vessels."
https://openalex.org/W1448641573,"Activation of IκB kinase (IKK) and NF-κB by genotoxic stresses modulates apoptotic responses and production of inflammatory mediators, thereby contributing to therapy resistance and premature aging. We previously reported that genotoxic agents induce nuclear localization of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) via an undefined mechanism to arbitrate subsequent DNA damage-dependent IKK/NF-κB signaling. Here we show that a nonclassical nuclear import pathway via IPO3 (importin 3, transportin 2) mediates stress-induced NEMO nuclear translocation. We found putative nuclear localization signals in NEMO whose mutations disrupted stress-inducible nuclear translocation of NEMO and IKK/NF-κB activation in stably reconstituted NEMO-deficient cells. RNAi screening of both importin α and β family members, as well as co-immunoprecipitation analyses, revealed that a nonclassical importin β family member, IPO3, was the only importin that was able to associate with NEMO and whose reduced expression prevented genotoxic stress-induced NEMO nuclear translocation, IKK/NF-κB activation, and inflammatory cytokine transcription. Recombinant IPO3 interacted with recombinant NEMO but not the nuclear localization signal mutant version and induced nuclear import of NEMO in digitonin-permeabilized cells. We also provide evidence that NEMO is disengaged from IKK complex following genotoxic stress induction. Thus, the IPO3 nuclear import pathway is an early and crucial determinant of the IKK/NF-κB signaling arm of the mammalian DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W1913038884,"Osteological variation is recorded among and within four of the most distinctive species of the Mexican salamander genus Chiropterotriton. Analysis of the data is consistent with the monophyletic status of the genus and documents previously unrecorded intraspecific and interspecific variation. Most of the recorded variation involves qualitative and quantitative proportional differences, but four fixed differences constitute autapomorphic states that affirm and diagnose some species (C. dimidiatus, C. magnipes). Osteological variation in 15 characters is analyzed with respect to predictions generated from four hypotheses: 1) phylogeny, 2) adaptation to specific habitats (the four species include cave-dwelling, terrestrial, and arboreal forms), 3) size-free shape, and 4) size. High levels of intraspecific variation suggest that the characters studied are not subject to rigid functional constraints in salamanders, regardless of size. The pattern predicted by the hypothesis based on size differences seen among these four Chiropterotriton species matches most closely the observed pattern of relative skull robustness. Since size change and heterochrony are often associated in plethodontid evolution, it is likely that changes in developmental timing play a role in the morphological transitions among these morphologically diverse taxa. Webbed feet, miniaturization, body shape, and an unusual tarsal arrangement are morphologies exhibited in species of Chiropterotrition that are shown to be homoplastic with other clades of tropical plethodontids. Although extensive homoplasy in salamanders might be seen as a roadblock to unraveling phylogenetic hypotheses, the homologous developmental systems that appear to underlie such homoplasy may reveal common and consistent evolutionary processes at work."

It is also unknown whether a particular landscape tree-infecting X. fastidiosa strain is capable of infecting multiple landscape tree species in an urban environment. We developed two PCR primers specific for mulberry-infecting strains of X. fastidiosa based on the nucleotide sequence of a unique open reading frame identified only in mulberry-infecting strains among all the North and South American strains of X. fastidiosa sequenced to date. PCR using the primers allowed for detection and identification of mulberry-infecting X. fastidiosa strains in cultures and in samples collected from naturally infected mulberry trees. In addition, no mixed infections with or non-specific detections of the mulberry-infecting strains of X. fastidiosa were found in naturally X. fastidiosa-infected oak, elm and sycamore trees growing in the same region where naturally infected mulberry trees were grown. This genotype-specific PCR assay will be valuable for disease diagnosis, studies of strain-specific infections in insects and plant hosts, and management of diseases caused by X. fastidiosa. Unexpectedly but interestingly, the unique open reading frame conserved in the mulberry-infecting strains in the U.

When the primer set was tested against naturally infected olive plant samples collected in Italy, it allowed for detection of olive-associated strains of X. fastidiosa in Italy. This PCR assay, therefore, will also be useful for detection and identification of the Italian group of X. fastidiosa strains to aid understanding of the occurrence, evolution and biology of this new group of X. fastidiosa strains."
https://openalex.org/W2278809712,"Both habitat filters and spatial processes can influence community structure. Space alone affects species immigration from the regional species pool, whereas habitat filters affect species distribution and inter-specific interactions. This study aimed to understand how the interplay between environmental and geographical processes influenced the structure of Neotropical snake communities in different habitat types. We selected six studies that sampled snakes in forests, four conducted in savannas and two in grasslands (the latter two are grouped in a non-forest category). We used the net relatedness and nearest taxon indices to assess phylogenetic structure within forest and non-forest areas. We also used the phylogenetic fuzzy-weighting algorithm to characterize phylogenetic structure across communities and the relation of phylogenetic composition patterns to habitat type, structure, and latitude. Finally, we tested for morphological trait convergence and phylogenetic niche conservatism using four forest and four non-forest areas for which morphological data were available. Community phylogenetic composition changed across forest and non-forest areas suggesting that environmental filtering influences community structure. Species traits were affected by habitat type, indicating convergence at the metacommunity level. Tail length, robustness, and number of ventral scales maximized community convergence among forest and non-forest areas. The observed patterns suggested environmental filtering, indicating that less vertically structured habitats represent a strong filter. Despite the fact that phylogenetic structure was not detected individually for each community, we observed a trend towards communities composed by more closely related species in higher latitudes and more overdispersed compositions in lower latitudes. Such pattern suggests that the limited distribution of major snake lineages constrained species distributions. Structure indices for each community were also related to habitat type, showing that communities from non-forest areas tend to be more clustered. Our study showed that both environmental filtering and spatial gradients play important roles in shaping the composition of Neotropical snake communities."

This study aimed to compare the treatment patterns of high grade glioma to examine survival patterns in patients who receive specific treatments between cohorts in Ohio and Taiwan. Method Patients aged 18 years and older at age of diagnosis with World Health Organization (WHO) grade III or IV astrocytoma from 2007-2012 were selected from the Ohio Brain Tumor Study and the Taiwan Cancer Registry. The treatment information was derived from medical chart reviews in Ohio and National Health Insurance Research Data in Taiwan. Treatment examined included surgical procedure (brain biopsy and/or resection), radiotherapy (radiation and/or radiosurgery), and alkylating chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier and parametric survival models were used to examine the effect of treatment on survival, adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities. Results 294 patients in Ohio and 1,097 patients in Taiwan met the inclusion criteria. 70.3% patients in Ohio and 51.4% in Taiwan received surgical resection, followed by concurrent chemoradiation. Patients who received this treatment had the highest survival rate, with a 1-year survival rate of 72.8% in Ohio and 73.4% in Taiwan. Patients who did not receive surgical resection, followed by concurrent chemoradiation had an increased risk of death (hazard ratio of 5.03 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.61-7.02] in Ohio and 1.49 [95% CI: 1.31-1.71] in Taiwan) after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities. Conclusion Surgical resection followed by concurrent chemoradiation was associated with higher survival rate of patients with high grade glioma in both Ohio and Taiwan; however, one-third of patients in Ohio and half in Taiwan did not receive this treatment."

To investigated associations between adiposity indices and platelet indices, 17327 eligible individuals (7677 males and 9650 females) from the Dongfeng-Tongji Cohort Study (DFTJ-Cohort Study, n=27009) were included in this study, except for 9682 individuals with missing data on demographical, lifestyle, physical indicators and diseases relative to PDW and MPV. Associations between adiposity indices including waist circumstance (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body mass index (BMI), and MPV or PDW in the participants were analyzed using multiple logistic regressions. There were significantly negative associations between abnormal PDW and WC or WHtR for both sexes (ptrend<0.001 for all), as well as abnormal MPV and WC or WHtR among female participants (ptrend<0.05 for all). In the highest BMI groups, only females with low MPV or PDW were at greater risk for having low MPV (OR=1.33, 95% CI=1.10, 1.62 ptrend<0.001) or PDW (OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.14, 1.58, ptrend<0.001) than those who had low MPV or PDW in the corresponding lowest BMI group. The change of PDW seems more sensitive than MPV to oxidative stress and hypoxia. Associations between reduced PDW and MPV values and WC, WHtR and BMI values in Chinese female adults may help us to further investigate early changes in human body."
https://openalex.org/W2338136809,"In the past decade, RNA silencing has gained significant attention because of its success in genomic scale research and also in the genetic improvement of crop plants. However, little is known about the molecular basis of siRNA processing in association with its target transcript. To reveal this process for improving hpRNA-mediated gene silencing in crop plants, the soybean GmFAD3 gene family was chosen as a test model. We analyzed RNAi mutant soybean lines in which three members of the GmFAD3 gene family were silenced. The silencing levels of FAD3A, FAD3B and FAD3C were correlated with the degrees of sequence homology between the inverted repeat of hpRNA and the GmFAD3 transcripts in the RNAi lines. Strikingly, transgenes in two of the three RNAi lines were heavily methylated, leading to a dramatic reduction of hpRNA-derived siRNAs. Small RNAs corresponding to the loop portion of the hairpin transcript were detected while much lower levels of siRNAs were found outside of the target region. siRNAs generated from the 318-bp inverted repeat were found to be diced much more frequently at stem sequences close to the loop and associated with the inferred cleavage sites on the target transcripts, manifesting ""hot spots"". The top candidate hpRNA-derived siRNA share certain sequence features with mature miRNA. This is the first comprehensive and detailed study revealing the siRNA-mediated gene silencing mechanism in crop plants using gene family GmFAD3 as a test model."
https://openalex.org/W2126874046,"Staphylococcus aureus carriers with S. aureus bacteremia may have a reduced mortality risk compared to non-carriers. A role for the immune system is suggested. Here, we study in mice the effect of mild S. aureus skin infection prior to endogenous or exogenous S. aureus bacteremia, and evaluate protection in relation to anti-staphylococcal antibody levels. Skin infections once or twice by a clinical S. aureus isolate (isolate P) or S. aureus strain 8325-4 were induced in mice free of S. aureus and anti-staphylococcal antibodies. Five weeks later, immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in blood against 25 S. aureus antigens were determined, and LD50 or LD100 bacteremia caused by S. aureus isolate P was induced. S. aureus skin infections led to elevated levels of anti-staphylococcal IgG in blood. One skin infection improved the course of subsequent severe endogenous bacteremia only. A second skin infection further improved animal survival rate, which was associated with increased pre-bacteremia IgG levels against Efb, IsaA, LukD, LukE, Nuc, PrsA and WTA. In conclusion, S. aureus isolate P skin infection in mice reduces the severity of subsequent endogenous S. aureus bacteremia only. Although cellular immune effects cannot be rules out, anti-staphylococcal IgG against specified antigens may contribute to this effect."
https://openalex.org/W582270414,"Large landscapes encompassing reserves and areas with other human uses are necessary for conservation of many species. Generating information for conservation planning over such landscapes may be expensive and time-consuming, though resources for conservation are generally limited and conservation is often urgent. We developed a sign-based occupancy survey to help prioritize conservation interventions by simultaneously assessing the distribution of 3 species, the lesser rhea, guanaco, and mara, and their association with human activities in a 20,000-km2 landscape in the northern Patagonian steppe. We used a single-season occupancy model with spatial rather than temporal replication of surveys in order to reduce costs of multiple visits to sites. We used covariates related to detectability, environmental factors, and different human activities to identify the most plausible models of occupancy, and calculated importance weights of covariates from these models to evaluate relative impacts of human activities on each species. Abundance of goats had the strongest negative association with lesser rheas and guanacos, and road density with maras. With six months of fieldwork, our results provided initial hypotheses for adaptive conservation interventions for each species. Addressing high livestock densities for rheas and guanacos, poaching by urban hunters for all three species, and hunting by rural people for rheas are priorities for conservation in this landscape. Our methodology provided new insights into the responses of these species, although low detection probabilities for maras indicate that the sampling scheme should be altered for future monitoring of this species. This method may be adapted for any large landscape where a rapid, objective means for prioritizing conservation actions on multiple species is needed and data are scarce."
https://openalex.org/W880360092,"Belief in God's control of the world is common to many of the world's religions, but there are conflicting predictions regarding its role in shaping attitudes toward the welfare state. While the devout are expected to support pro-social values like helping others, and thus might be supportive of the welfare state, the possibility of taking action is undermined by the belief in God's absolute control over world affairs and in a morally perfect providence, who is responsible for the fates of individuals. As the literature provides mixed results on this question, this study examines the role of belief in God's control on welfare attitudes using three priming experiments and two priming tasks, carried out with a design that is both cross-cultural (US vs. Israel) and cross-religious tradition (Judaism vs. Catholicism). We find evidence that, largely, belief in God's control increases support for income redistribution among Israeli Jews (study 1), American Jews (study 2), and American Catholics (study 3). The findings suggest that the traditional and common political gap between the economic left and the religious, based on the evaluation that religious beliefs lead to conservative economic preferences, may be overstated."
https://openalex.org/W591921176,"Cancer is a serious disease responsible for many deaths every year in both developed and developing countries. One reason is that the mechanisms underlying most types of cancer are still mysterious, creating a great block for the design of effective treatments. In this study, we attempted to clarify the mechanism underlying esophageal cancer by searching for novel genes and chemicals. To this end, we constructed a hybrid network containing both proteins and chemicals, and generalized an existing computational method previously used to identify disease genes to identify new candidate genes and chemicals simultaneously. Based on jackknife test, our generalized method outperforms or at least performs at the same level as those obtained by a widely used method - the Random Walk with Restart (RWR). The analysis results of the final obtained genes and chemicals demonstrated that they highly shared gene ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways with direct and indirect associations with esophageal cancer. In addition, we also discussed the likelihood of selected candidate genes and chemicals being novel genes and chemicals related to esophageal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W629550743,"Verbal overshadowing refers to a phenomenon whereby verbalization of non-verbal stimuli (e.g., facial features) during the maintenance phase (after the target information is no longer available from the sensory inputs) impairs subsequent non-verbal recognition accuracy. Two primary mechanisms have been proposed for verbal overshadowing, namely the recoding interference hypothesis, and the transfer-inappropriate processing shift. The former assumes that verbalization renders non-verbal representations less accurate. In contrast, the latter assumes that verbalization shifts processing operations to a verbal mode and increases the chance of failing to return to non-verbal, face-specific processing operations (i.e., intact, yet inaccessible non-verbal representations). To date, certain psychological phenomena have been advocated as inconsistent with the recoding-interference hypothesis. These include a decline in non-verbal memory performance following verbalization of non-target faces, and occasional failures to detect a significant correlation between the accuracy of verbal descriptions and the non-verbal memory performance. Contrary to these arguments against the recoding interference hypothesis, however, the present computational model instantiated core processing principles of the recoding interference hypothesis to simulate face recognition, and nonetheless successfully reproduced these behavioral phenomena, as well as the standard verbal overshadowing. These results demonstrate the plausibility of the recoding interference hypothesis to account for verbal overshadowing, and suggest there is no need to implement separable mechanisms (e.g., operation-specific representations, different processing principles, etc.). In addition, detailed inspections of the internal processing of the model clarified how verbalization rendered internal representations less accurate and how such representations led to reduced recognition accuracy, thereby offering a computationally grounded explanation. Finally, the model also provided an explanation as to why some studies have failed to report verbal overshadowing. Thus, the present study suggests it is not constructive to discuss whether verbal overshadowing exists or not in an all-or-none manner, and instead suggests a better experimental paradigm to further explore this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2159077129,"In order to improve the homogeneity and dispersity of the sericite in methylphenyl-silicone resin, the agglomerate state of the sericites was controlled effectively. The dispersive model of the sericite in methylphenyl-silicone resin was designed also. First, the modified sericite was prepared using hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide as the intercalating agent. Then, functional sericite was incorporated into methylphenyl-silicone by terminal hydroxyl. The structure and dispersive performance of the hybrid polymers was charactered by analytical instruments. Scanning electron microscopy and Transmission electron microscope, Laser scanning confocal microscope and X-ray diffraction analysis showed that functional sericite was dispersed homogeneously in methylphenyl-silicone resin matrix. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that the absorption peaks of the Si-OH band of methylphenyl-silicone resin were decreased and the Si-O-Si band was increased. This change evidently showed a significant role to enhance the reaction degree of the functional sericite in methylphenyl-silicone resin."
https://openalex.org/W2102780166,"Transactivator protein C is required for the expression of bacteriophage Mu late genes from lys, I, P and mom promoters during lytic life cycle of the phage. The mechanism of transcription activation of mom gene by C protein is well understood. C activates transcription at Pmom by initial unwinding of the promoter DNA, thereby facilitating RNA polymerase (RNAP) recruitment. Subsequently, C interacts with the ß' subunit of RNAP to enhance promoter clearance. The mechanism by which C activates other late genes of the phage is not known. We carried out promoter-polymerase interaction studies with all the late gene promoters to determine the individual step of C mediated activation. Unlike at Pmom, at the other three promoters, RNAP recruitment and closed complex formation are not C dependent. Instead, the action of C at Plys, PI, and PP is during the isomerization from closed complex to open complex with no apparent effect at other steps of initiation pathway. The mechanism of transcription activation of mom and other late promoters by their common activator is different. This distinction in the mode of activation (promoter recruitment and escape versus isomerization) by the same activator at different promoters appears to be important for optimized expression of each of the late genes."
