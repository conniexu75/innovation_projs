https://openalex.org/W1988418842,"Current techniques for three-dimensional (3D) optical microscopy (deconvolution, confocal microscopy, and optical coherence tomography) generate 3D data by “optically sectioning” the specimen. This places severe constraints on the maximum thickness of a specimen that can be imaged. We have developed a microscopy technique that uses optical projection tomography (OPT) to produce high-resolution 3D images of both fluorescent and nonfluorescent biological specimens with a thickness of up to 15 millimeters. OPT microscopy allows the rapid mapping of the tissue distribution of RNA and protein expression in intact embryos or organ systems and can therefore be instrumental in studies of developmental biology or gene function."

We have discovered that physical dispersion of nonporous, nanoscale, fumed silica particles in glassy amorphous poly(4-methyl-2-pentyne) simultaneously and surprisingly enhances both membrane permeability and selectivity for large organic molecules over small permanent gases. These highly unusual property enhancements, in contrast to results obtained in conventional filled polymer systems, reflect fumed silica–induced disruption of polymer chain packing and an accompanying subtle increase in the size of free volume elements through which molecular transport occurs, as discerned by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. Such nanoscale hybridization represents an innovative means to tune the separation properties of glassy polymeric media through systematic manipulation of molecular packing."

Here we used this approach to show that newly synthesized connexin43 was transported predominantly in 100- to 150-nanometer vesicles to the plasma membrane and incorporated at the periphery of existing gap junctions, whereas older connexins were removed from the center of the plaques into pleiomorphic vesicles of widely varying sizes. Selective imaging by correlated optical and electron microscopy of protein molecules of known ages will clarify fundamental processes of protein trafficking in situ."

We examine their apparently paradoxical property, facilitation of efficient permeation of water while excluding protons, which is of critical importance to preserving the electrochemical potential across the cell membrane. We have determined the structure of the Escherichia coli aquaglyceroporin GlpF with bound water, in native (2.7 angstroms) and in W48F/F200T mutant (2.1 angstroms) forms, and carried out 12-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations that define the spatial and temporal probability distribution and orientation of a single file of seven to nine water molecules inside the channel. Two conserved asparagines force a central water molecule to serve strictly as a hydrogen bond donor to its neighboring water molecules. Assisted by the electrostatic potential generated by two half-membrane spanning loops, this dictates opposite orientations of water molecules in the two halves of the channel, and thus prevents the formation of a ""proton wire,"" while permitting rapid water diffusion. Both simulations and observations revealed a more regular distribution of channel water and an increased water permeability for the W48F/F200T mutant."

We show that mammalian FOXO3a also functions at the G2 to M checkpoint in the cell cycle and triggers the repair of damaged DNA. By gene array analysis, FOXO3a was found to modulate the expression of several genes that regulate the cellular response to stress at the G2-M checkpoint. The growth arrest and DNA damage response gene Gadd45a appeared to be a direct target of FOXO3a that mediates part of FOXO3a's effects on DNA repair. These findings indicate that in mammals FOXO3a regulates the resistance of cells to stress by inducing DNA repair and thereby may also affect organismal life-span."
https://openalex.org/W2018716226,"Thromboxane (Tx) A2 is a vasoconstrictor and platelet agonist. Aspirin affords cardioprotection through inhibition of TxA2 formation by platelet cyclooxygenase (COX-1). Prostacyclin (PGI2) is a vasodilator that inhibits platelet function. Here we show that injury-induced vascular proliferation and platelet activation are enhanced in mice that are genetically deficient in the PGI2 receptor (IP) but are depressed in mice genetically deficient in the TxA2 receptor (TP) or treated with a TP antagonist. The augmented response to vascular injury was abolished in mice deficient in both receptors. Thus, PGI2 modulates platelet-vascular interactions in vivo and specifically limits the response to TxA2. This interplay may help explain the adverse cardiovascular effects associated with selective COX-2 inhibitors, which, unlike aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), inhibit PGI2 but not TxA2."
https://openalex.org/W2034508297,"Simian virus 40 (SV40) utilizes endocytosis through caveolae for infectious entry into host cells. We found that after binding to caveolae, virus particles induced transient breakdown of actin stress fibers. Actin was then recruited to virus-loaded caveolae as actin patches that served as sites for actin ""tail"" formation. Dynamin II was also transiently recruited. These events depended on the presence of cholesterol and on the activation of tyrosine kinases that phosphorylated proteins in caveolae. They were necessary for formation of caveolae-derived endocytic vesicles and for infection of the cell. Thus, caveolar endocytosis is ligand-triggered and involves extensive rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2025234475,"Cadherins are transmembrane proteins that mediate adhesion between cells in the solid tissues of animals. Here we present the 3.1 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the whole, functional extracellular domain from C-cadherin, a representative ""classical"" cadherin. The structure suggests a molecular mechanism for adhesion between cells by classical cadherins, and it provides a new framework for understanding both cis (same cell) and trans (juxtaposed cell) cadherin interactions. The trans adhesive interface is a twofold symmetric interaction defined by a conserved tryptophan side chain at the membrane-distal end of a cadherin molecule from one cell, which inserts into a hydrophobic pocket at the membrane-distal end of a cadherin molecule from the opposing cell."

https://openalex.org/W1992960292,"Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein, which is over-expressed in most tumors. Aberrant expression of survivin and loss of wild-type p53 in many tumors prompted us to investigate a possible link between these two events. Here we show that wild-type p53 represses survivin expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Transient transfection analyses revealed that the expression of wild-type p53, but not mutant p53, was associated with strong repression of the survivin promoter in various cell types. The over-expression of exogenous survivin protein rescues cells from p53-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that loss of survivin mediates, at least, in part the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway. In spite of the presence of two putative p53-binding sites in the survivin promoter, deletion and mutation analyses suggested that neither site is required for transcriptional repression of survivin expression. This was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Further analyses suggested that the modification of chromatin within the survivin promoter could be a molecular explanation for silencing of survivin gene transcription by p53."

https://openalex.org/W2056431359,"The 19S proteasome regulatory particle plays a critical role in cellular proteolysis. However, recent reports have demonstrated that 19S proteins play a nonproteolytic role in nucleotide excision repair and transcription elongation. We show by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that proteins comprising the 19S complex are recruited to the GAL1-10 promoter by the Gal4 transactivator upon induction with galactose. This recruited complex does not contain proteins from the 20S proteolytic particle and includes a subset of the 19S proteins. This subset is also specifically retained from an extract by the Gal4 activation domain. These data indicate that in vivo, the base of the 19S complex functions independently of the larger complex and plays a direct, nonproteolytic role in RNA polymerase II transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1973876121,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters harvest the energy present in cellular ATP to drive the translocation of a structurally diverse set of solutes across the membrane barriers of eubacteria, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes. The positively cooperative ATPase activity (Hill coefficient, 1.7) of a model soluble cassette of known structure, MJ0796, fromMethanococcus jannaschii indicates that at least two binding sites participate in the catalytic reaction. Mutation of the catalytic base in MJ0796, E171Q, produced a cassette that can bind but not efficiently hydrolyze ATP. The equivalent mutation (E179Q) in a homologous cassette, MJ1267, had an identical effect. Both mutant cassettes formed dimers in the presence of ATP but not ADP, indicating that the energy of ATP binding is first coupled to the transport cycle through a domain association reaction. The non-hydrolyzable nucleotides adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate and adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate were poor analogues of ATP in terms of their ability to promote dimerization. Moreover, inclusion of MgCl2, substitution of KCl for NaCl, or alterations in the polarity of the side chain at the catalytic base all weakened the ATP-dependent dimer, suggesting that electrostatic interactions are critical for the association reaction. Thus, upon hydrolysis of bound ATP and the release of product, both electrostatic and conformational changes drive the cassettes apart, providing a second opportunity to couple free energy changes to the transport reaction.

Mutations in human ABC transporters underlie diseases such as cystic fibrosis, hypercholesterolemia, adrenoleukodystrophy, and Stargardt's disease, while multidrug resistance in cancer cells and infectious microorganisms often arises from the overexpression of ABC transporters that serve as drug efflux pumps (2Higgins C.F.

The organization of prokaryotic transporter operons and of single polypeptide chain transporters suggests that the minimal functional unit consists of at least two cassettes and two TM domains (5Thomas P.J.

Moreover these structures possess surprisingly open nucleotide binding sites and largely lack physical interactions between the LSGGQ signature sequence and the bound nucleotide, although mutations in this motif affect ATP hydrolysis (14Shyamala V.

Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) suggests a resolution of this conundrum and provides a potential mechanism for the power stroke of ABC transporters. In Rad50, two opposing nucleotide binding domains bind the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP with the Walker A and B sites of one monomer and an LSGGQ-like sequence of the other monomer completing the two binding pockets in a dimer that sandwiches the two nucleotides at the interface (12Hopfner K.P.

George A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 179: 187-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) forms a much more occluded active site and is consistent with the effect of LSGGQ sequence mutations on ATP hydrolysis (14Shyamala V.

Biochem. 1999; 266: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the absence of AMP-PNP Rad50 is monomeric, suggesting a model for the mechanism of ABC-type ATPases wherein an ATP-driven dimerization of the cassettes couples ATP binding and hydrolysis to useful thermodynamic output (12Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). In the transporters, the formation of such an ATP-dependent dimer and/or dissociation of the dimer driven by ATP hydrolysis could mediate rearrangements of the TM domains that support solute transport across the membrane. This model suggests that a cassette mutant that binds but is unable to hydrolyze ATP might form a stable ATP sandwich dimer. To test this hypothesis and gain insight into the mechanism of ABC transporters, we mutated the catalytic base of two model archaeal nucleotide binding cassettes and characterized their ability to form nucleotide-dependent dimers.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4858-4863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and histidine (23Liu C.E. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) transporters. By contrast, the E171Q mutant of MJ0796 had undetectable ATPase activity (Fig. 1C). The equivalent mutation in the MJ1267 cassette (E179Q) also eliminated its ATPase activity (data not shown). These results show that the carboxylate functional group of the highly conserved glutamate residue at the C terminus of the Walker B sequence (Fig. 1A) is required for ATP hydrolysis. Based on the Rad50 model for the transport cycle, the hydrolysis-deficient glutamate to glutamine mutants of ABC transporter nucleotide binding cassettes would be expected to form a similar ATP-bound homodimer provided their nucleotide binding ability is unaltered by the mutation. To assay the ability of mutant cassettes to form stable, nucleotide-dependent dimers, we performed experiments wherein protein samples were mixed with ADP or ATP and then resolved on a size exclusion column. The data (Fig.2, A and B) show that both wild type and E171Q mutant MJ0796 migrated as monomers in the absence of ATP. However, the E171Q mutant migrated largely as a homodimer in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2B). Wild type MJ0796 migrated as a monomer regardless of the presence of ATP (Fig.2A). ADP did not support the formation of a stable dimer of either wild type (Fig. 2A) or mutant (Fig. 2B) MJ0796. Moreover the addition of ADP inhibited ATP-dependent dimer formation in the E171Q mutant (data not shown). The fact that the mutant ATP-containing dimer was stable during elution in the absence of nucleotide in the mobile phase indicates that the nucleotide sandwich dimers only slowly dissociate in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. Consistent with our findings, previous studies of wild type HisP (24Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and MalK (25Kennedy K.A. Traxler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6259-6264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) exhibit no more than a small degree of dimerization in the presence of nucleotide. The dependence of the dimerization of the E171Q mutant of MJ0796 on ATP concentration is shown in the analytical gel filtration data in Fig.2C. The midpoint of the titration was between 50 and 100 μm, consistent with the Km for ATP hydrolysis observed for wild type MJ0796 (Fig. 2C). Analogous results demonstrating the ATP-dependent dimerization of the E179Q mutant of the MJ1267 nucleotide binding cassette are shown in Fig. 2D. The midpoint of the titration occurred at a slightly higher ATP concentration for this protein. Like MJ0796, wild type MJ1267 did not form stable dimers in the presence of ATP (data not shown). To determine the energetics of the ATP-dependent homodimerization of MJ0796-E171Q observed by analytical gel filtration, samples were analyzed at a protein concentration of 56 μmby equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (data summarized in Table I). In the absence of ATP, aKD of 208 μm was calculated for monomer-homodimer equilibrium, indicating that the protein was present primarily as a monomer under these conditions, consistent with the gel filtration results (Fig. 1B). Again ADP did not support dimerization in the equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation analysis. By contrast, the addition of 2 mm ATP resulted in a reduction of the KD to 70 nm, indicating that the protein was present primarily as a dimer under these conditions. The steep dependence of the KD on ATP concentration is expected if dimerization is coupled to positively cooperative ATP binding in the symmetric sandwich dimer (27Goldsmith E.J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 702-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues ATPγS and AMP-PNP failed to promote cassette dimerization in gel filtration experiments on wild type MJ0796 and MJ1267 (data not shown) and only poorly promoted dimerization of the mutant cassettes (Fig.3A). These results suggest that these analogues, while useful in numerous other applications, are not always accurate mimetics of their natural counterparts. The subtle electrostatic and steric differences between conventional nucleotides and the non-hydrolyzable analogs apparently prevent stable cassette dimerization. This observation likely explains the difficulty experienced in isolating wild type cassette dimers in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues. The addition of Mg2+ or the substitution of K+for Na+ during analytical gel filtration and ultracentrifugation experiments inhibited the formation of the MJ0796-E171Q dimer (Fig. 3B and Table I). Addition of 10 mm MgCl2 lowered the dimer level by ∼25% in the presence of 10 mm ATP. Likewise a decrease in dimerization was seen when KCl was substituted for NaCl (Fig.3B and Table I). In KCl the KD for dimerization increased from 20 to 600 nm. Interestingly mutating the catalytic glutamate in MJ1267 to alanine (E179A) diminished ATP-dependent dimerization to 10% of the level achieved with the E179Q mutant (Fig. 3B). The ability of these modifications of the ionic environment to alter the energetics of dimer formation reinforces the idea that carefully balanced electrostatic effects play a critical role in mediating the ATP-dependent dimerization of ABC transporter nucleotide binding cassettes. Upon ATP hydrolysis, additional alterations in the electrostatics of the interface due to deprotonations and/or product release could effectively destabilize the sandwich dimer (Fig.4). The structure of the stable ATP sandwich dimer of MJ0796-E171Q has been solved by x-ray crystallography and details the specific nature of these interactions. 2P. C. Smith, N. Karpowich, L. Millen, J. Moody, J. Rosen, P. J. Thomas, and J. F. Hunt, submitted. Interestingly in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel (28Rich D.P. Anderson M.P.

Cell. 1992; 68: 809-818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), only the C-terminal cassette contains the catalytic glutamate residue. A recent study of the non-equivalency of CFTR cassettes demonstrated that nucleotide binds stably and dissociates slowly from the N-terminal cassette, while the C-terminal cassette rapidly hydrolyzes nucleotide (26Aleksandrov L. Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X.-b. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, based on the data presented here, it is possible that the N-terminal cassette of CFTR, which contains a serine rather than glutamate at the end of the Walker B sequence, forms associations that stabilize the protein in a substate that has channel activity. Conformational changes coupled to hydrolysis of the bound ATP also likely play a role in driving the cassettes apart (Fig. 4). Comparison of ADP-bound conformations of the MJ0796 and MJ1276 cassettes with the ATP-bound form of the HisP cassette suggests that ATP binding produces a significant rotation of an α-helical subdomain in the cassettes accompanied by rearrangement of the γ-phosphate linker segment and rotation of a conserved histidine residue out of the active site (7Hung L.W.

However, this subdomain rotation is unlikely to be the power stroke of the transport process since the mutation of the phylogenetically invariant glutamine residue (the equivalent of Gln-90 in MJ0796 and Gln-89 in MJ1267) mediating the rotation slows but does not abolish transport. 3L. Millen, J. E. Moody, and P. J. Thomas, unpublished results. In this regard, while these subdomain rearrangements are most likely critical for determining the rate of product release, the best candidate for the power stroke of ABC transporters is the ATP-driven formation of the cassette dimer as proposed by Hopfner et al. (12Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A.

In this model, in the intact transporter the cassette dimer-monomer transition would be coupled to conformational changes in the TM domains that modulate the affinity and differential exposure of a transport substrate binding site on alternating sides of the membrane barrier.

A family of intracellular cysteine proteases, the caspases, are responsible for most biochemical and morphological alterations during apoptosis (3Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Caspases reside in the cytosol as dormant proforms that can be activated by proteolytic cleavage at specific aspartate residues (3Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Caspases involved in apoptosis can be subdivided into initiator and effector caspases. Effector caspases such as caspase-3, -6, and -7 cleave multiple cellular substrates during the death process. These cleavage events result in degradation and reorganization of cellular structures, inactivation or activation of signal transduction pathways, alterations in gene transcription, and inhibition of DNA repair (3Nicholson D.W.

For example, activation of caspase-9 occurs via binding of the adaptor protein apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 to the caspase recruitment domain (7Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I.

The association of caspase-9 and apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 and subsequent “apoptosome” formation is triggered by the pro-apoptotic factor cytochrome c (12Hu Y. Ding L. Spencer D.M. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33489-33494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar,13Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar). This factor normally resides in the mitochondrial intermembrane and intracristal space where it participates in electron transport during respiration. During apoptosis, cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic factors are released from the intermembrane space because of a significant increase in mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (14Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar).Recent time-lapse confocal microscopy experiments in cells expressing cytochrome c-green fluorescent protein (GFP)1 fusion proteins suggested that the release of pro-apoptotic factors during apoptosis occurs rapidly and completely (15Heiskanen K.M.

Apart from stimuli that may activate both necrotic and apoptotic pathways, the release kinetics during apoptosis are similar and largely independent of the type of stimulus (16Goldstein J.C.

In the present study, we demonstrate that caspase activation resembles an “all or nothing” type of response that is only marginally influenced by the type of stimulus or concentration used. We also show that efficient activation of caspases can occur in the absence of caspase-3, albeit leading to significantly slower cleavage kinetics. Finally, we address the issue whether differences in cleavage kinetics lead to differences in cell death.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we employed single-cell FRET analyses to monitor the activation of DEVD-preferring caspases within individual cells during apoptosis. In vitro, the 18-amino acid linker region was efficiently cleaved by effector caspase–3 and –7 but also by initiator caspase–8 and –9. These findings are in agreement with previous specificity studies on recombinant caspases (20Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), suggesting that the FRET probe monitors the activity of the two major but not all effector caspases. We cannot exclude the possibility that part of the FRET probe cleavage was attributable to the activity of initiator caspase-8 and -9. However, the differential kinetics of FRET probe cleavage in MCF-7 compared with MCF-7/Casp-3 cells suggest that the majority of the activity was due to caspase-3. It should also be noted that caspase-8 may function as an effector caspase during apoptosis (41Stepczynska A. Lauber K. Engels I.H. Janssen O. Kabelitz D. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the FRET probe cleavage is a surprisingly rapid and efficient process that is only marginally influenced by the type or severity of the apoptotic stimulus. Bulk studies suggest that treatment of cells with different apoptotic stimuli may result in differential kinetics of FRET probe cleavage. Our results demonstrate that these differences are rather caused by differences in the lag time between onset of stimulus and onset of caspase activation. Differences in the magnitude of effector caspase activation observed in bulk analyses are likewise caused by differences in the percentage of cells actually undergoing effector caspase activation. Rapid FRET probe cleavage (≤10 min) has been detected previously in response to staurosporine in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the myc-CFP-DEVD-YFP probe (18Tyas L. Brophy V.A. Pope A. Rivett A.J. Tavare J.M. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), suggesting that rapid cleavage kinetics are common to many cell types. Interestingly, rapid cleavage of the recombinant FRET probe occurred both in the cytosol and in the nucleus (Fig. 1 E (18Tyas L. Brophy V.A. Pope A. Rivett A.J. Tavare J.M. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar)). This finding is in agreement with previous reports (42Ferrando-May E. Cordes V. Biller-Ckovric I. Mirkovic J. Gorlich D. Nicotera P. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 43Faleiro L. Lazebnik Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) showing that nuclear pores open rapidly during apoptosis and supports the concept that the activation of effector caspases is a rapid and efficient process, encompassing the entire cell.The release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome cfrom the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol during apoptosis is believed to be a very rapid and coordinated event (16Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar,17Luetjens C.M. Kogel D. Reimertz C. Dussmann H. Renz A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nieminen A.L. Poppe M. Prehn J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is likely that a critical accumulation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in the cytosol or outer mitochondrial membrane coordinates the rapid release of pro-apoptotic factors (14Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar) and downstream from this the rapid activation of effector caspases. A rapid, complete release of pro-apoptotic factors may be required for an efficient apoptosome formation or to efficiently override an apoptosis inhibitory block achieved by inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins and molecular chaperones (44Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 45Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C.

In future studies, it will be interesting to investigate at the single-cell level whether cytochromec release is always followed by caspase activation and to determine the temporal relationship between the two events. Our data suggest that rapid FRET probe cleavage is also involved in death receptor-induced apoptosis. In many cell types, activation of death receptors is directly linked to the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway via caspase-8 cleavage of the BH3-only family member Bid (48, 49). Interestingly, MCF-7/Casp-3 cells do not require this positive feedback signal, thereby representing so-called type I cells (50Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Here, the successful formation of another multiprotein complex, the death-inducing signaling complex, may be the rate-limiting step for the activation of DEVDases.FRET disruption was significantly slower in MCF-7 cells that lack caspase-3 compared with MCF-7/Casp-3 cells. Apart from the actual lack of this enzyme, it has been shown that caspase-3 activation represents a positive feedback loop for the activation of procaspase-9 (51Fujita E. Egashira J. Urase K. Kuida K. Momoi T. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 52Blanc C. Deveraux Q.L. Krajewski S. Jänicke R.U. Porter A.G. Reed J.C. Jaggi R. Marti A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4386-4390PubMed Google Scholar). Lack of this feedback loop may cause a slower activation of caspases in MCF-7 cells, particularly at submaximal concentrations of the pro-apoptotic agents. Caspase-3 is also important for the processing and activation of effector caspase-2 (51Fujita E. Egashira J. Urase K. Kuida K. Momoi T. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and -6 (21Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W.

It is conceivable that diffusion processes may also play a role in the slower kinetics of FRET disruption in MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, we did not detect a decreased percentage of MCF-7 cells that underwent FRET probe cleavage in response to staurosporine compared with the MCF-7/Casp-3 cells. It is important to note in this context that the release of cytochrome c after activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is believed to be a caspase-independent process (16Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 55Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar), a finding that we have also observed in MCF-7 cells (17Luetjens C.M. Kogel D. Reimertz C. Dussmann H. Renz A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nieminen A.L. Poppe M. Prehn J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the release of the pro-apoptotic factor Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria has been suggested to be a caspase-dependent process (56Adrain C. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6627-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Smac/DIABLO facilitates effector caspase activation during apoptosis by neutralizing the activity of inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (57Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L., Wu, J.W., Du, C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 58Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J., Wu, J.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 2000; 408: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Other studies (59Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Rosen S. Reed J.C. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24453-24456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 60Zhang X.D. Zhang X.Y. Gray C.P. Nguyen T. Hersey P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7339-7348PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Smac release can precede cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase-3 activation. The release of Smac from mitochondria could represent an important regulatory step for the (kinetics of) effector caspase activation. Its release could be significantly slowed down in MCF-7 cells, particularly at submaximal pro-apoptotic stimuli. This could lead to the significantly slower kinetics of FRET disruption observed under these conditions.The slower cleavage kinetics of caspases in MCF-7 compared with MCF-7/Casp-3 cells were of functional significance. For example, MCF-7 cells required a longer time to undergo cell shrinkage after onset of the FRET probe cleavage. Likewise, MCF-7 cells do not exhibit oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation (22Jänicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). However, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses demonstrated no pronounced differences in the total cell death rate between the two cell types after treatment with staurosporine, both at maximal and submaximal staurosporine concentrations. Activation of effector caspases may therefore represent a “point-of-no-return” in mammalian cells with multiple caspases being able to compensate for each other. However, alternative cell death pathways activated by the release of pro-apoptotic factor from mitochondria may also mediate cell death. These include a mitochondrial dysfunction program with subsequent ATP depletion and free radical production directly due to the loss of cytochrome c (61Mootha V.K. Wei M.C. Buttle K.F. Scorrano L.

Nerve growth factor-deprived sympathetic neurons, for example, can only be rescued to the time point of mitochondrial dysfunction in the presence of caspase inhibitors (64Deshmukh M. Kuida K. Johnson E.M., Jr. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic activity of apoptosis-inducing factor and endonucleases may also come into play once the activation of effector caspases is blocked (65Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G.

Ledwich D. Wang X. Xue D. Nature. 2001; 412: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar).Further single-cell studies are required to answer the question at which stage in the apoptotic cascade cells are able to escape the death process. Studies in trophic factor-deprived neurons have provided evidence that cytochrome c release is a reversible event (64Deshmukh M. Kuida K. Johnson E.M., Jr. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 68Martinou I. Desagher S. Eskes R. Antonsson B. Andre E. Fakan S. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In our experiments, all cells that underwent FRET probe cleavage showed subsequent cell shrinkage (average lag time in HeLa D98 cells, 42 ± 2 min), but it still remains unclear whether all these cells are indeed irreversibly damaged. We monitored HeLa D98 cells exposed to low dose staurosporine (0.1 μm) up to 10 h after the FRET probe cleavage had occurred. Interestingly, only 44 and 60% of these cells were disrupted into apoptotic bodies or underwent secondary necrosis 7 and 10 h after the onset of the FRET probe cleavage (n = 48 and 30 cells), respectively. In mutants of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, it has been demonstrated that cells are able to escape cell death after caspase activation (25Hoeppner D.J. Hengartner M.O. Schnabel R. Nature. 2001; 412: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 69Reddien P.W. Cameron S. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 2001; 412: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, C. elegans expresses only one protein of the caspase family for the execution of apoptosis. Likewise, evidence is lacking whether activation of apoptosis in C. elegans also involves a mitochondrial organelle dysfunction program (70Dorstyn L. Read S. Cakouros D. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Further single-cell studies that allow recovery of cells from pro-apoptotic stimuli over a prolonged period are necessary to establish whether mammalian cells are indeed able to escape cell death once effector caspases are activated. Apoptosis is an evolutionary conserved, cellular process that plays an important role during development, but it is also involved in tissue homeostasis and in the pathophysiology of proliferative and neurodegenerative disorders (1Meier P. Finch A. Evan G. Nature. 2000; 407: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 2Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). A family of intracellular cysteine proteases, the caspases, are responsible for most biochemical and morphological alterations during apoptosis (3Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Caspases reside in the cytosol as dormant proforms that can be activated by proteolytic cleavage at specific aspartate residues (3Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Caspases involved in apoptosis can be subdivided into initiator and effector caspases. Effector caspases such as caspase-3, -6, and -7 cleave multiple cellular substrates during the death process. These cleavage events result in degradation and reorganization of cellular structures, inactivation or activation of signal transduction pathways, alterations in gene transcription, and inhibition of DNA repair (3Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 4Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J.

Sci. 2001; 26: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Initiator caspases predominantly function to activate effector caspases. Activation of initiator caspase-8 and -9 requires the binding of adaptor proteins to specific interaction motifs within their prodomain, leading to their oligomerization and autoactivation (6Boldin M.P.

To determine whether the osteolytic factor parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is the primary mediator of the tumor response to TGF-β, mice were inoculated with MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells expressing a constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor. Treatment of the mice with a PTHrP-neutralizing antibody greatly decreased osteolytic bone metastases. There were fewer osteoclasts and significantly decreased tumor area in the antibody-treated mice. TGF-β can signal through both Smad and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways. Stable transfection of wild-type Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 increased TGF-β-stimulated PTHrP secretion, whereas dominant-negative Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 only partially reduced TGF-β-stimulated PTHrP secretion. When the cells were treated with a variety of protein kinases inhibitors, only specific inhibitors of the p38 MAP kinase pathway significantly reduced both basal and TGF-β-stimulated PTHrP production. The combination of Smad dominant-negative blockade and p38 MAP kinase inhibition resulted in complete inhibition of TGF-β-stimulated PTHrP production. Furthermore, TGF-β treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a rapid phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase.

A dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor (TβRIIΔcyt) stably expressed in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer line rendered the cells unresponsive to TGF-β and inhibited TGF-β-induced PTHrP secretion and the development of bone metastases in a mouse model. This dominant-negative type II blockade was reversed by a constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI(T204D)). Furthermore, transfection of the cDNA for PTHrP into the dominant-negative MDA-MB-231 line also increased PTHrP production and accelerated bone metastases (9Yin J.J. Selander K. Chirgwin J.M.

These published data establish that TGF-β in bone can promote osteolysis by increasing PTHrP secretion from breast cancer cells. They do not, however, exclude contributions from other TGF-β-responsive tumor factors. Here we demonstrate that PTHrP is the central mediator of TGF-β-induced osteolytic metastasis. We also show that TGF-β increases PTHrP secretion from MDA-MB-231 cells by signaling through both Smad and p38 MAP kinase pathways. First, to determine whether PTHrP is the major mediator of TGF-β-induced osteolysis, mice were inoculated with an MDA-MB-231 clonal line overexpressing the constitutively active type I TGF-β receptor, TβRI(T204D), and treated with neutralizing PTHrP antibody or control IgG. The mice treated with PTHrP antibody had a significantly lower tumor burden than the control mice, suggesting that the major downstream effector of TGF-β in the development and progression of bone metastases was PTHrP. TGF-β increases PTHrP expression by stabilizing mRNA as well as by transcriptional mechanisms (6Kiriyama T. Gillespie M.T. Glatz J.A. Fukumoto S. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Mol. Cell.

To examine the signaling pathways by which the TGF-β increases the PTHrP production, wild-type and dominant-negative Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 were stably overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and the changes in PTHrP production were measured. The data supported both Smad-dependent and independent mechanism for the TGF-β stimulation of PTHrP production by breast cancer cells. Specific protein kinase inhibitors were used to determine the Smad-independent signaling of TGF-β to increase PTHrP production. This study indicated that the MAP kinase pathway, and specifically p38 MAP kinase, is a major component of this Smad-independent signaling by TGF-β and provides new molecular targets for anti-osteolytic therapy. MDA-MB-231 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). The Smad2 wild-type (pcDNA3-FLAG-MADR2) and dominant-negative (pcDNA3-FLAG-MADR2(3S-A)) cDNA expression plasmids were provided by Drs. Wrana and Attisano (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada) (31Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), and the dominant-negative pcDNA3-FLAG-Smad3D407E by Dr. Kato, Tokyo, Japan (33Goto D. Yagi K. Inoue H. Iwamoto I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Smad wild-type and dominant-negative cDNAs were recloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The Smad plasmids and pcDNA3 (empty vector) were transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM reagent (Invitrogen). Single clones were isolated by limiting dilution in the presence of neomycin analogue G418 (Sigma). The clones were assessed by transient transfection with the TGF-β-responsive plasminogen activator inhibitor promoter linked to firefly luciferase (3TP-lux), as well as PTHrP production in response to 5 ng/ml recombinant human TGF-β1 (R & D Systems Inc.) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium after 24 h of incubation. More than 50 clones were characterized for each construct. The MDA-MB-231 clone overexpressing dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor (TβRIIΔcyt), which is truncated at the intracytoplasmic domain (34Wieser R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7239-7247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was constructed as described previously (9Yin J.J. Selander K. Chirgwin J.M. Dallas M. Grubbs B.G. Wieser R. Massague J. Mundy G.R. Guise T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). This clone, MDA-MB-231/TβRIIΔcyt, is unresponsive to TGF-β. Stable expression of a constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI(T204D)) (35Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) into MDA-MB-231/TβRIIΔcyt reversed the dominant-negative TGF-β blockade. This stable clone, MDA-MB-231/TβRIIΔcyt + TβRI(T204D), demonstrated constitutive TGF-β activity, even in the absence of ligand (9Yin J.J. Selander K. Chirgwin J.M. Dallas M. Grubbs B.G. Wieser R. Massague J. Mundy G.R. Guise T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). The inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO (cell culture grade; Sigma) and used in the following concentrations: wortmannin (20 μm), herbimycin A (35 nm), KT5720 (100 nm), KT5823 (150 nm), SB203580 (10 μm), SB202190 (10 μm), and PD98059 (20 μm). All of the inhibitors except wortmannin (Sigma) were obtained form Calbiochem. The inhibitors diluted in normal growth medium were added to wells containing confluent MDA-MB-231 cells and incubated for 3 h. TGF-β (5 ng/ml) was added to serum-free medium containing the respective inhibitors and incubated for 24 h, after which time the conditioned media were collected and the cells were counted. The samples were stored at −80 °C until measured. Me2SO (0.05% v/v) diluted in medium was used as a negative control. The optimal inhibitor concentration and incubation time for MAP kinase inhibitors SB203580, SB202190, and PD98059 were determined by time course and dose-response studies. Concentrations for p38 inhibitors SB203580 and SB202190 (1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 μm) and for MEK inhibitor PD98059 (2, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μm) were tested. The concentrations of 10 and 20 μm were selected for p38 inhibitors and MEK inhibitor, respectively, based on the capacity to inhibit PTHrP production without affecting cell viability. Subsequently, incubation times of 6, 12, 24, 30, and 48 h after 3 h of preincubation were used to determine the optimal inhibitor incubation time without affecting cell viability. The results indicated that the 24-h incubation time was optimal for all of the MAP kinase inhibitors used. The animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Female nude (BALB/c) mice 4 weeks of age were housed in laminar flow isolated hoods. Water supplemented with vitamin K and autoclaved mouse chow were provided ad libitum. Whole blood samples for ionized calcium concentration were obtained by retro-orbital puncture under metofane anesthesia, and the radiographs were taken under mouse mixture (30% ketamine and 20% xylazine in 0.9% NaCl). Tumor inoculation into the left cardiac ventricle was performed as described previously (3Guise T.A. Yin J.J. Taylor S.D. Kumagai Y. Dallas M. Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1544-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The mice were inoculated with a tumor cell suspension of clonal MDA-MB-231/TβRIIΔcyt + TβRI(T204D) cells into the left cardiac ventricle on day 0, after base-line radiographs, body weight, and blood Ca2+ were determined. The mice were treated with neutralizing PTHrP mAb directed against PTHrP(1–34) (antibody-producing hybridoma, 3F5, obtained from Dr. T. J. Martin, St. Vincent's Institute, Melbourne, Australia) or isotype matched control IgG (Sigma) (n = 8/group; 1 mg subcutaneously, at the time of tumor inoculation and 1 week later). Ca2+, body weight, and radiographs were monitored weekly for 6 weeks, at which time the mice were sacrificed. All of the bones and soft tissues were fixed in formalin for histological analysis. The radiographs were analyzed as described later in this paper. Neutralizing PTHrP mAb was produced as ascitic fluid in BALB/c mice primed with Pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethly pentadecane; Sigma) and purified by protein G-agarose chromatography (AmershamBiosciences). Response to TGF-β was measured by transient transfection of the 3TP-lux reporter construct, which contains three copies of a TGF-β-responsive element from the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter linked to a firefly luciferase-coding sequence. The 3TP-lux reporter is activated by Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 (31Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Co-transfected pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as an internal control reporter expressingRenilla luciferase. The Renilla and firefly luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) and a Turner TD-20e luminometer (Turner Designs Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). PTHrP concentrations were measured in 24-h conditioned media using a two-site immunoradiometric assay (Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA) as reported previously (3Guise T.A. Yin J.J. Taylor S.D. Kumagai Y. Dallas M. Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1544-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The standard curve was generated by using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as a standard diluent; 0.3pmol/l was the limit of detection. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured on Petri plates without or with 5 ng/ml of TGF-β for various times (0, 10, 20, and 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h). After incubation the cells were lysed using cell lysis buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Western blotting was performed according to the manufacturer's directions (New England Biolabs) using phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr180/Tyr182) and p38 MAP kinase-specific antibodies to detect the phosphorylated and total p38 MAP kinase. Relative phosphorylation was determined using intensity values quantitated with a Kodak Digital ScienceTMelectrophoresis documentation and analysis system 120 (Eastman Kodak Co.). Ca2+concentrations were measured in whole blood using a Ciba Corning 634 ISE Ca2+/pH analyzer (Corning Medical and Scientific, Medfield, MA) as described previously (3Guise T.A. Yin J.J. Taylor S.D. Kumagai Y. Dallas M. Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1544-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The animals were x-rayed using a 43855A x-ray system (Faxitron, Buffalo Grove, IL) as described previously (3Guise T.A. Yin J.J. Taylor S.D. Kumagai Y. Dallas M. Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1544-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). All of the radiographs were evaluated without knowledge of the treatment groups. Quantitation of lesion area was performed using image analysis software (Java, Jandel Video Analysis; Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA). Forelimb and hind limb bones were removed from mice at the time of sacrifice, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, decalcified in 14% EDTA, and embedded in paraffin. The sections were stained with hematoxylin, eosin, orange G, and phloxine. Total tumor area and osteoclast number/mm of tumor/bone interface were measured in midsections of tibiae and femora without knowledge of experimental groups. Histomorphometric analysis was performed using OsteoMeasure System program (Osteometrics Inc., Atlanta, GA). The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer post-test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Six weeks after tumor inoculation with the MDA-MB-231 stable clone expressing the constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor (MDA-MB-231/TβRIIΔcyt + TβRI(T204D)), the number and the area of osteolytic lesions were significantly less in mice treated with PTHrP mAb compared with those treated with control IgG (Fig. 1,A and B). The tumor area was less, and osteoclasts were fewer in tumor-bearing mice treated with PTHrP mAb (Fig. 1, C and D). The body weights were greater in mice treated with PTHrP mAb compared with the control IgG (21.7 ± 0.7 g versus 17.7 ± 0.9 g; p = 0.009). To test whether the major effect of TGF-β on PTHrP production is via the Smad proteins, we stably expressed wild-type and dominant-negative mutants of Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 in MDA-MB-231. Wild-type Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 clones, which had enhanced responses to TGF-β, and dominant-negative Smad clones, which had reduced response to TGF-β in the 3TP-lux reporter assay, were further characterized. Fig. 2demonstrates that MDA-MB-231 stable clones that express dominant-negative Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 did not respond to TGF-β in the 3TP-lux reporter assay. Stable MDA-MB-231 clones that express wild-type or dominant-negative Smad forms were characterized for PTHrP production in response to TGF-β using a two-site PTHrP immunoradiometric assay (Fig. 3). Compared with parental cells and empty vector controls, the MDA-MB-231/TβRIIΔcyt cell line was unresponsive to TGF-β, as reported previously (9Yin J.J. Selander K. Chirgwin J.M. Dallas M. Grubbs B.G. Wieser R. Massague J. Mundy G.R. Guise T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of the dominant-negative Smads (Smad2(3S-A), Smad3(3S-A), Smad3(D407E), or Smad4(1–514)) failed to completely suppress TGF-β-stimulated PTHrP secretion by MDA-MB-231 cells. On the other hand, overexpression of wild-type Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 enhanced PTHrP production in response to TGF-β. These data suggest that TGF-β signaling to induce PTHrP production is mediated only partially through the Smad pathway. The data suggested that both Smad-dependent and -independent pathways mediated the effect of TGF-β to stimulate PTHrP production by MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We investigated the Smad-independent pathways by treating parental MDA-MB-231 with specific signaling pathway inhibitors. Protein kinase A (KT5720), protein kinase G (KT5823), tyrosine kinase (herbimycin A), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin) inhibitors did not affect basal or TGF-β-induced PTHrP secretion (Fig. 4). However, the p38 MAP kinase inhibitors, SB203580 and SB202190, and the MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, significantly reduced both basal and TGF-β-stimulated PTHrP production dose-dependently (Fig. 4). Therefore, these inhibitors were tested in the context of the Smad dominant-negative blockade. In empty vector MDA-MB-231 clones, TGF-β-stimulated PTHrP was effectively decreased by both p38 inhibitors; SB202190 was more potent (Fig. 5 A). The reduction of TGF-β-stimulated PTHrP production by the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, was likely due to decreased basal PTHrP production because the ratio of TGF-β-stimulated PTHrP to untreated was similar to the control. The cells expressing the dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor (MDA-MB-231/TβRIIΔcyt) did not respond to TGF-β and secreted a low amount of PTHrP that was not affected by either p38 or MEK1/2 inhibitors (Fig. 5 B). p38 inhibition by SB202190 significantly reduced basal and TGF-β-induced PTHrP production by an MDA-MB-231 clone that expressed the constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor (TβRIIΔcyt + TβRI(T204D)), whereas MEK inhibition by PD98059 reduced the basal PTHrP synthesis (Fig. 5 B,inset).Figure 5Effect of MAP kinase inhibitors on PTHrP production in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing dominant-negative Smads.

In the presence of Smad2 dominant-negative blockade, p38 inhibition decreased the basal and TGF-β-induced PTHrP production. MEK inhibition reduced basal PTHrP production, but the ratio of TGF-β-stimulated PTHrP to control was similar to no inhibition (Fig. 5 C). The combination of p38 inhibition and Smad2 dominant-negative blockade totally inhibited the TGF-β induction of PTHrP, comparable with that observed in the dominant-negative type II TGF-β receptor. Similar results were obtained with the Smad3 and Smad4 dominant-negative clones (Fig. 5, D–F). However, the clone that expressed the dominant-negative Smad3(D407E) displayed less responsiveness to TGF-β in the presence of p38 inhibition than the Smad3(3S-A) clone (Fig.5 E). The data suggested that TGF-β signals via p38 MAP kinase to induce PTHrP production in MDA-231 cells. We confirmed the involvement of p38 MAP kinase in TGF-β-signaling in parental MDA-MB-231 cells using Western blotting and antibodies specific for nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase. The relative phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase was increased in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 5 ng/ml of TGF-β compared with control. The TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase occurred as early as 10 min post-treatment and peaked at 1 h with a 5.5-fold increase. (Fig.6). The role of TGF-β in malignancy is multifunctional (38Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar, 39Massagué J. Nat.

We use the delta13C record of a thermocline-dwelling foraminifera, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, and surface temperature estimates from the eastern equatorial Pacific to demonstrate that the onset of delta13C minimum events and the initiation of Southern Ocean warming occurred simultaneously. Timing agreement between the marine record and the delta13C minimum in an Antarctic atmospheric record suggests that the deglacial events were a response to the breakdown of surface water stratification, renewed Circumpolar Deep Water upwelling, and advection of low delta13C waters to the convergence zone at the sub-Antarctic front. On the basis of age agreement between the absolute delta13C minimum in surface records and the shift from low to high delta13C in the deep South Atlantic, we suggest that the delta13C rise that marks the end of the carbon isotope minima was due to the resumption of North Atlantic Deep Water influence in the Southern Ocean."

In Earth's mantle, elastic anisotropy is induced by minerals that are preferentially oriented in a directional flow or deformation. Earthquakes generate two seismic wave types: compressional (P) and shear (S) waves, whose coupling in anisotropic rocks leads to scattering, birefringence, and waves with hybrid polarizations. This varied behavior is helping geophysicists explore rock textures within Earth's mantle and crust, map present-day upper-mantle convection, and study the formation of lithospheric plates and the accretion of continents in Earth history."

We infer that the two superplumes may play a major and stable role in supplying heat and horizontal flow to the low-viscosity asthenospheric channel, lubricating plate motions and feeding hot spots.

Science. 2001; 293: 2080-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). N-Shh is secreted and represents the biologically active form of the protein, capable of initiating signaling. The current model for Shh signaling involves a pair of multiple-pass plasma membrane proteins, Patched (Ptc or Ptc-1) and Smoothened (Smo) (reviewed in Ref. 15Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2469) Google Scholar): Ptc functions as the Shh-binding subunit/receptor, and Smo as the signal transducing subunit. When bound to Smo, Ptc acts as a repressor of Smo signaling activity. Following N-Shh interaction with Ptc, bound Ptc releases from Smo and de-represses the signaling activity of Smo. The expression of Ptc-1, Gli-2, HNF3β, Nkx2.2, and netrin-1 has been shown to be activated by Shh, and genes including pax-3,gli-3, and ephrin A5 have been shown to be suppressed by Shh (16Hynes M., Ye, W. Wang K. Stone D. Murone M. Sauvage F. Rosenthal A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Litingtung Y. Chiang C. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Megalin (also known as gp330 and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)-2) is an endocytic receptor belonging to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family (18Argraves W.S. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D406-D416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor is expressed on apical surfaces of numerous epithelia, where it functions to mediate endocytosis of ligands, targeting them for lysosomal degradation or transcytosis (18Argraves W.S. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D406-D416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice deficient in the expression of megalin demonstrate the critical neurodevelopmental role for this protein (19Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Armstrong S.A. Rohlmann A. Hammer R.E. Burns D.K. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). These mice display numerous craniofacial abnormalities, including absence of olfactory bulbs, absence of the corpus callosum, and fusion of forebrain hemispheres, collectively an holoprosencephaly phenotype (19Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Armstrong S.A. Rohlmann A. Hammer R.E. Burns D.K. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). During development, megalin-deficient embryos (9.5 days postcoitus) have pronounced cell death in several structures, including cranial nerves, the neural crest, and the optic vesicle (19Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Armstrong S.A. Rohlmann A. Hammer R.E. Burns D.K. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The spectrum of defects that constitute the megalin-deficient phenotype suggests that megalin expression is required for normal viability of the neural epithelium at an early embryonic stage. The phenotype of megalin-deficient mice suggests a role for megalin in regulating cell fate specification in the patterning of the neural tube and is consistent with phenotypes observed in mice deficient in Shh and the Shh signal transducer, Smo (8Litingtung Y. Chiang C. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Chen W. Burgess S. Hopkins N. Development. 2001; 128: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Shh-deficient embryos lack cranial motor neurons (8Litingtung Y. Chiang C. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Shh signaling in the neural tube has been shown to result in extensive apoptosis of neural epithelial cells (21Ahlgren S.C. Bronner-Fraser M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1304-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Shh has also been shown to regulate proliferation and to inhibit differentiation of central nervous system precursor cells (22Rowitch D.H., S- Jacques B. Lee S.M. Flax J.D. Snyder E.Y. McMahon A.P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8954-8965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smo mutants also display neural tube-related defects, including increased apoptosis of cells within the neural tube, absence of secondary motor neurons, synopthalmia, and ventral forebrain defects (20Chen W. Burgess S. Hopkins N. Development. 2001; 128: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Varga Z.M. Amores A. Lewis K.E. Yan Y.L. Postlethwait J.H. Eisen J.S. Westerfield M. Development. 2001; 128: 3497-3509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The shared aspects of the megalin-, Shh-, and Smo-deficient phenotypes suggest that Shh and megalin impact common mechanisms that underlie central nervous system development. Here, we report findings from experiments directed at determining whether a functional relationship exists between megalin and Shh. Murine sarcoma virus-transformed Brown Norway rat yolk sac cells (BN cells) were provided by Dr. Pierre Verroust (Hospital Tenon, Paris, France). Mouse embryonic teratocarcinoma F9 cells (ATCC CRL1720) were differentiated by treatment with retinoic acid and dibutyryl cAMP for 6 days as previously described (24Stefansson S. Chappell D.A. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19417-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). C3H10T1/2 cells (ATCC CCL226) were obtain from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies to megalin (rb6286 and 1H2) have been described previously (25Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14176-14181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-megalin IgGs were purified by protein G-Sepharose and megalin-Sepharose chromatography (26Kounnas M.Z. Haudenschild C.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. In Vivo (Athens). 1994; 8: 343-351PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-receptor-associated protein (RAP) antibody 7F1 has been described previously (27Battey F.D. Gafvels M.E. FitzGerald D.J. Argraves W.S. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-N-Shh antibody 5E1 IgG was isolated from the conditioned culture medium of a hybridoma cell line obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and University of Iowa). Goat anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-labeled secondary IgGs were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Megalin was purified from porcine kidney as described previously (28Kounnas M.Z. Stefansson S. Loukinova E. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Human RAP was expressed in bacteria and purified as described by Kounnas et al. (29Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21162-21166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant murine N-Shh (residues 25–198) was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). A plasmid construct was created to express GST-N-Shh fusion protein in bacteria. Briefly, this involved using reverse transcription-PCR to generate a cDNA encoding amino acids 20–198 of Shh from a cDNA template prepared from day 9.5 postcoitus mouse embryo RNA. The Shh cDNA fragment was inserted into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) such that the resulting plasmid encoded a fusion protein composed of GST followed by a thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGS), a five-amino acid phosphorylation target site (RRASV), and the N-Shh polypeptide. The construct was transformed into BL21 bacteria, and the fusion protein was isolated using glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Recombinant GST was produced from cells transformed with the empty pGEX-2TK vector. Both recombinant protein preparations were adsorbed onto a Detoxigel endotoxin removing gel (Pierce). The biological activity of GST-N-Shh was assayed in C3H10T1/2 cells using the method of Williams et al. (30Williams K.P. Rayhorn P. Chi-Rosso G. Garber E.A. Strauch K.L. Horan G.S. Reilly J.O. Baker D.P. Taylor F.R. Koteliansky V. Pepinsky R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4405-4414PubMed Google Scholar). GST-N-Shh and GST-RAP were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using heart muscle kinase (Sigma) based on the manufacturer's recommendations and the protocol of Stefansson et al. (31Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of protein was incubated with 125 units of heart muscle kinase in 1× heart muscle kinase buffer (20 mm PIPES (pH 6.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaCl, and 12 mm MgCl2) plus 0.1% denatured bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (AmershamBiosciences) for 1 h. Labeled fusion protein was purified by size-exclusion chromatography using PD-10 columns. Typical specific activities were 0.5–2 × 108 cpm/nmol. Zebrafish were maintained, and embryos were collected by standard methods (32Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). 3rd Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar). Embryos were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Embryos were washed two times with PBS, permeabilized by washing three times with PBS containing 0.1% saponin at 37 °C, and blocked for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS containing 5% goat serum and 0.1% saponin (goat serum/saponin/PBS). Embryos were incubated with primary antibody (5 μg/ml) in goat serum/saponin/PBS first for 1 h at 37 °C, then overnight at 4 °C, and finally for an additional 1 h at 37 °C with rocking. Embryos were washed three times with goat serum/saponin/PBS at 37 °C and incubated with Cy3-coupled goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1.5 μg/ml) in goat serum/saponin/PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were washed three times with goat serum/saponin/PBS and dehydrated in methanol, followed by clearing in Murray's Clear (1:2 benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate). Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC-1400 confocal microscope and Bio-Rad LaserSharp2000 software. Detergent extraction of cells and immunoblot detection of megalin were performed as described previously (24Stefansson S. Chappell D.A. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19417-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). RAP ligand blot overlay assay was performed as described by Battey et al. (27Battey F.D. Gafvels M.E. FitzGerald D.J. Argraves W.S. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed essentially as described previously (33Hammad S.M. Ranganathan S. Loukinova E. Twal W.O. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18644-18649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, varying concentrations of N-Shh or GST-N-Shh in 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 3% nonfat milk, and 0.05% Tween 20 were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in microtiter wells coated with megalin (3 μg/ml). Bound N-Shh was detected using monoclonal antibody 5E1, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and the chromogenic substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD). For homologous ligand competition assays, 32P-labeled GST-N-Shh (1 nm) was incubated in microtiter wells coated with megalin (3 μg/ml) in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor (GST-N-Shh or RAP). All other conditions were similar to those described by Williams et al. (34Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The algorithm Ligand (35Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar) within SigmaPlot 7.101 was used to analyze the competition data and to determine dissociation (K d ) and inhibition (K i ) constants for receptor-ligand interactions. Kinetic analysis of the interaction of GST-N-Shh with purified megalin was performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements made on a BIAcore 3000 instrument. BIAcore sensor chips (type CM5) were activated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide in water. Megalin (50 μg/ml, 83 nm in 10 mm sodium acetate at pH 4.8) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using the amine coupling kit (BIAcore) as described by the supplier. Unreacted sites were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5). The SPR signal from immobilized megalin generated BIAcore response units ranging from 20,000 to 28,000. Control flow cells were activated and blocked in the absence of protein. Binding was evaluated over a range of GST-N-Shh concentrations (25–500 nm) in 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% polysorbate 20, and 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) with and without 1 mm CaCl2 at 25 °C. Binding of GST-N-Shh to megalin-immobilized flow cells was corrected for binding to control flow cells. Binding data were fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluation Version 3.1 software (BIAcore). To evaluate the effect of pH on the dissociation of megalin-ligand complexes, GST-N-Shh or RAP (each at 3 μm in buffer A (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 150 mmNaCl)) were passed at 10 μl/min for 2 min over sensor chips containing immobilized megalin. Subsequently, protein-free buffer A or sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5; sodium ion concentration adjusted to 150 mm) was applied for 5 min. The kinetic dissociation profiles obtained under neutral and acid pH conditions were used to calculate off-rates (k off) using the BIAevaluation Version 3.1 program. Between replicate experiments, the chip surface was regenerated with a 10-s pulse of 10 mmglycine (pH 2.2) at 5 μl/min. BN cells were plated at 0.25 × 105 cells/cm2 in eight-well chamber slides (Nunc Nalge, Naperville, IL) in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium). Cells were grown for 16 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and the medium was replaced with serum-free medium (Eagle's minimal essential medium containing nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 5 μg/ml selenic acid). After a 1.5-h incubation, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing 1.5% BSA and either GST-N-Shh (20 nm) or GST (20 nm) with or without competitors and cultured for 2 h. Competitors included RAP (1 μm) and GST (1 μm). For immunological detection, GST-N-Shh- and GST-treated cells were rinsed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (pH 7.4), fixed for 20 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde with 0.2% Triton X-100 in DPBS, and then rinsed in DPBS. Cells were incubated with 2% BSA in DPBS for 1 h, treated with goat anti-GST IgG at 1 μg/ml in 2% BSA in DPBS for 1 h and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG at 3 μg/ml in DPBS for 1 h, and rinsed in DPBS. For nuclear staining, cells were treated with RNase A (100 μg/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C, rinsed in DPBS, and then treated with TOTO-3 (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR) at 1 μg/ml in DPBS for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed in DPBS, mounted in Vector Shield mounting solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and then examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy. BN cells were seeded into wells of 24-well plates at 0.5 × 105cells/cm2 and grown for 16 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in complete medium and then for 1.5 h in serum-free medium. The medium was replaced with serum-free medium plus 1.5% BSA and 32P-labeled GST-N-Shh (3 nm) with or without the indicated agents (i.e. RAP, IgG, or heparin), and cells were grown for 2–6 h. For experiments measuring the effect of chloroquine treatment, chloroquine was added at 0.1 mmconcomitantly with radiolabeled ligands, and uptake was allowed to proceed for 6 h. Quantification of the amount of bound, internalized, and degraded ligands was performed as described previously (36Stefansson S. Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Mallampalli R.K. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2361-2368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity in the cell medium that was soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid was taken to represent degraded ligand. Total ligand degradation was corrected for the amount of degradation that occurred in radioligand-containing medium in the absence of cells. To determine the amount of 32P-labeled ligand that was bound and internalized, cells were washed three times with DPBS and then treated with serum-free medium containing 0.5 mg/ml trypsin, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma), and 0.5 mm EDTA for 2–4 min at 4 °C. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 6000 ×g for 4 min, and the amount of radioactivity in the supernatant was taken to represent the bound fraction, whereas the amount in the cell pellet was taken as the internalized fraction. Uptake experiments with differentiated and control F9 cells were performed as described above with the exception that cells were seeded at 1.0 × 105 cells/cm2, and the growth medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum (or insulin, transferrin, and selenic acid) containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Despite indications that megalin is critical to neurodevelopment (19Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Armstrong S.A. Rohlmann A. Hammer R.E. Burns D.K. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), little was known about the expression of the receptor during early development. Laser scanning confocal microscopic analysis of 16-h zebrafish embryos revealed that megalin was prominent in the floor plate of the neural tube (Fig. 1 A,arrow) and on the apical surface of the optic cup (arrowhead). By 24 h, megalin expression was detected in cells of the ventral floor plate (Fig. 1 B,arrow) and on the apical surface of cells lining the lumen of the neural tube (arrowhead). At 33 h, ventral floor plate expression persisted, and megalin was also extensively expressed on cells comprising the luminal surfaces of the forebrain and midbrain (Fig. 1 D, arrowhead), with strong expression at the midbrain-hindbrain border (Fig. 1 C,arrowhead). At the base of the midbrain, intense staining for megalin was seen at the most anterior extent of the floor plate (Fig. 1 D, arrow). Outside the central nervous system, megalin was detected on the apical surfaces of cells lining the lumen of the otic vesicle of the developing ear (Fig. 1 E,arrowheads). In the area of the developing mouth of 48-h embryos, megalin was distributed medially and laterally in the frontonasal and maxillary processes, respectively (Fig. 1 G). These findings demonstrate that early embryonic expression of megalin occurs at specific organizing centers for morphogenesis, including the ventral neural tube, optic and otic vesicles, and orofacial regions. Many of the observed embryonic sites of megalin expression were the same as those known to express Shh, including the ventral floor plate, eye, otic vesicle, and frontonasal process (2Charrier J.B. Lapointe F. Douarin N.M. Teillet M.A. Development. 2001; 128: 4011-4020PubMed Google Scholar, 3Zhang X.M. Yang X.J. Dev.

A notable exception was the absence of megalin expression in the notochord (Fig.2, A and B,arrowheads). Also, megalin expression in the neural tube extended more dorsally than Shh (Figs. 2 (insets) and 1B), detected in areas of the neural tube known to express the receptors for Shh, Ptc-1, and Ptc-2 (38Lewis K.E. Concordet J.P. Ingham P.W. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 14-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The results indicate that megalin is expressed in tissues that express Shh or in adjacent tissues regulated by Shh signaling. These observations support the possibility that a functional relationship exists between megalin and Shh during early neurodevelopment. The similarity of megalin- and Shh-null phenotypes and the early embryonic distribution of megalin in relation to sites of Shh production led us to investigate whether megalin and N-Shh are capable of directly binding to one another. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that recombinant GST-N-Shh (Fig. 3) and a commercial preparation of N-Shh bound to purified megalin with similar apparent affinities (Fig. 4 A). Binding between GST-N-Shh and megalin was also tested using a homologous ligand competition assay. 32P-Labeled GST-N-Shh bound to megalin, and the binding was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of unlabeled GST-N-Shh (Fig. 4 B). AK d of 81.3 nm was obtained from fitting the data to a one-site model using the Ligand algorithm. Binding of32P-labeled GST-N-Shh to megalin was also inhibited by RAP, a well established antagonist of megalin-ligand interaction (39Willnow T.E. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 1025-1031PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the RAP competition data could best be fit to a two-site model with K i values of 3.0 and 2341.9 nm. One interpretation of these findings is that RAP binds to megalin at multiple sites and that one of these binding interactions is a stronger inhibitor of N-Shh binding to megalin. Such an interpretation is consistent with the fact that the megalin family member LRP has multiple RAP-binding sites (34Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 4Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and competitive radioligand binding assay demonstrate that N-Shh binds to megalin and that RAP inhibits the binding. In A, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that both GST-N-Shh (○) and commercially available N-Shh (●) bound to megalin. In B, homologous ligand displacement assay (○) was used to demonstrate the interaction between 32P-labeled GST-N-Shh and megalin, and heterologous ligand displacement assay (●) was used to show that RAP inhibited binding of 32P-labeled GST-N-Shh to megalin. Thecurves shown in B were based on fits of the data calculated using the computer program Ligand.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of Shh to megalin was also evaluated using SPR. As shown in Fig. 5, GST-N-Shh bound to megalin immobilized on a sensor chip. GST alone displayed no measurable binding to megalin (data not shown). Optimal fitting of SPR data obtained from measuring the binding of various concentrations of GST-N-Shh to immobilized megalin was best achieved using a single class binding site model. As a result, an affinity constant (K D ) of 21 nm (n = 7; χ2 of fit < 10) was determined for GST-N"

Nature. 2001; 414: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We have searched for potential homologs of Dlt in human epithelial cells and characterized one of them in intestinal epithelial cells. Human INAD-like (hINADl) contains 8 PDZ domains, is concentrated in tight junctions, and is also found at the apical plasma membrane. Overexpression of hINADl disrupted the tight junctions localization of ZO-1 and 3. We also identified a partial cDNA coding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of a new human crumbs (CRB3) expressed in Caco-2 cells. This CRB3 was able to interact through its C-terminal end with the N-terminal domain of hINADl. Taken together, the data indicate that hINADl is likely to represent a Dlt homolog in mammalian epithelial cells and might be involved in regulating the integrity of tight junctions. We thus propose to rename hINADl PATJ for proteinassociated to tight junctions. dCrumbs is an apical organizer crucial for the maintenance of epithelial polarity in Drosophila(1Knust E. Curr. Opin.

We have searched for potential homologs of Dlt in human epithelial cells and characterized one of them in intestinal epithelial cells. Human INAD-like (hINADl) contains 8 PDZ domains, is concentrated in tight junctions, and is also found at the apical plasma membrane. Overexpression of hINADl disrupted the tight junctions localization of ZO-1 and 3. We also identified a partial cDNA coding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of a new human crumbs (CRB3) expressed in Caco-2 cells. This CRB3 was able to interact through its C-terminal end with the N-terminal domain of hINADl. Taken together, the data indicate that hINADl is likely to represent a Dlt homolog in mammalian epithelial cells and might be involved in regulating the integrity of tight junctions. We thus propose to rename hINADl PATJ for proteinassociated to tight junctions. zonula adherens Madin-Darby canine kidney human inactivation no after potential D-like zonula occludens tight junctions septate junctions Discs lost multi-PDZ-domain protein atypical protein kinase C dipeptidyl peptidase IV vesicular stomatitis virus protein G protein associated to tight junctions reverse transcriptase new human crumbs membrane-associated guanylate kinase Stardust Drosophila The polarized organization of epithelial cells is a fundamental process in animal development and the use of genetics inDrosophila has made a significant contribution to the understanding of some of the mechanisms involved in epithelial polarity (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Knust E.

This approach has led to the identification of Armadillo (7Peifer M. McCrea P.D. Green K.J. Wieschaus E. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), Discs Large(8Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), and Scribble (9Bilder D. Perrimon N. Nature. 2000; 403: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), to name a few of the genes regulating epithelial cell shape and polarity. Among the protein complexes that have been identified as playing a major role in creating or maintaining epithelial cell polarity in Drosophila, the dCrumbs (Crumbs) complex remains the only one localized on the apical side of the epidermal cells (10Tepass U. Theres C. Knust E. Cell. 1990; 61: 787-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Embryos mutant for crumbs die after gastrulation with severe defects in epidermal cell polarity (11Wodarz A. Hinz U. Engelbert M. Knust E. Cell. 1995; 82: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) because of a failure to assemble a zonula adherens (ZA)1 from spot adherens junctions (12Tepass U. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 13Grawe F. Wodarz A. Lee B. Knust E. Skaer H. Development. 1996; 122: 951-959PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, dCrumbs, which is localized on the apical side of the ZA, controls its assembly and positioning during gastrulation. Its cytoplasmic domain, which contains 37 amino acids, mediates this important function. In fact one of the loss-of-function alleles of crumbs (8F105) is a stop mutation that prevents the translation of the last 23 amino acids (10Tepass U. Theres C. Knust E. Cell. 1990; 61: 787-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Recently, a gene named Discs lost (dlt) was shown to have a crucial role in epithelial polarization (2Bhat M.A. Izaddoost S., Lu, Y. Cho K.O. Choi K.W. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and the protein Dlt is also localized to the subapical region where dCrumbs is concentrated. Indeed, Dlt interacts by the first of its four PDZ (PSD95/Discs Large/ZO-1) domains (2Bhat M.A. Izaddoost S., Lu, Y. Cho K.O. Choi K.W. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) with the C-terminal four amino acids ERLI of the dCrumbs cytoplasmic domain (14Klebes A. Knust E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 76-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, the dCrumbs-Dlt complex is a key component regulating cell polarity probably by controlling the assembly and positioning of the ZA in Drosophila epidermal cells. The presence of four PDZ domains in Dlt enables it to build a protein complex serving as a scaffold whose ultimate function would be to direct the assembly of E-cadherin and other components to their correct positions in the membrane. Although the identification of the dCrumbs complex inDrosophila has shed light on epithelial organization, very little is known about the conservation of such a complex in vertebrates. First, the organization of the junctional complexes is different between arthropods and vertebrates because the latter possesses tight junctions (TJs) localized just apical to the ZA, whereas the former establish septate junctions (SJs) basolateral to the ZA (1Knust E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Tight junctions are made of transmembrane proteins such as claudins and occludins and septate junctions contain neurexin IV. SJs recruit cytoplasmic proteins like Discs Large, Coracle, and Scribble, whereas TJs have ZO-1, -2, -3, and cingulin as peripheral proteins (for a recent review, see Ref. 15Zahraoui A. Louvard D. Galli T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F31-F36Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, while performing the sealing of the epithelial monolayer SJs and TJs can be considered as distinct molecular entities. It has been proposed that the subapical region (or marginal zone) of epithelial cells in Drosophila can be compared to some extent to TJs of vertebrates (1Knust E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In fact, some of the proteins found in this subapical region like Par-3 (Bazooka) and an atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) are also localized at the TJs (16Wodarz A. Ramrath A. Grimm A. Knust E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1361-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar,17Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). If this hypothesis is true, a protein complex homolog to the dCrumbs complex should also be localized to the TJs in mammalian epithelial cells. Interestingly, a human homolog of Crumbs, called CRB1, was cloned from patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa 12, but the isolated cDNA lacked a transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain (18den Hollander A.I. ten Brink J.B. de Kok Y.J. van Soest S. van den Born L.I. van Driel M.A. van de Pol D.J. Payne A.M. Bhattacharya S.S. Kellner U. Hoyng C.B. Westerveld A. Brunner H.G. Bleeker- Wagemakers E.M. Deutman A.F. Heckenlively J.R. Cremers F.P. Bergen A.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). No homolog of Dlt has yet been described and therefore the existence of a conserved complex in vertebrates is unknown. To answer this question, we have searched for putative homologs of Dlt in human epithelial cells using the first PDZ domain of Dlt, which was suggested to bind the cytoplasmic tail of dCrumbs (2Bhat M.A. Izaddoost S., Lu, Y. Cho K.O. Choi K.W. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We have identified two human proteins with a highly conserved PDZ domain, Mupp1 (19Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lubbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and hINADl (20Philipp S. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and have characterized one of these, hINADl. hINADl was localized to the apical membrane and was highly concentrated at the level of the TJs both in Caco-2 and MDCK epithelial cells. Overexpression of hINADl in MDCK cells disrupted the localization of TJs markers (ZO-1 and ZO-3). In addition, hINADl co-immunoprecipitated with a new human Crumbs expressed in epithelial cells, CRB3, in which the extracellular domain was replaced by a vesicular stomatitis virus protein G (VSV-G) epitope (Crumbs-VSV-G). This interaction involved the N-terminal region of hINADl and the C-terminal region of the CRB3 cytoplasmic domain. Thus a complex similar to the one found in Drosophila can regulate the function of TJs in mammalian epithelial cells outside the retina where CRB1 is expressed. Protein A-Sepharose was fromAmersham Biosciences. Polyclonal antibodies against ZO-1 and ZO-3 were a kind gift from Dr. K. Matter (London, UK), and polyclonal antibodies against villin were from Dr. D. Louvard (Paris, France). Monoclonal antibody against dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) was a gift from Dr. A. Quaroni (Ithaca, NY), and monoclonal antibody against Ag525 has been characterized previously (21Le Bivic A. Bosc-Biern I. Reggio H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 113-120PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-placental alkaline phosphatase was from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp. (Westbury, NY). Monoclonal antibody against occludin was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), and 9E10 monoclonal antibody against Myc was from Santa Cruz (La Jolla, CA). A mouse monoclonal anti-VSV-G antibody P5D4 (Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:500 and 1:300 for immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, respectively. Polyclonal antibodies against hINADl (fragments 10–130 and 800–1000) and Mupp1 (fragment 787–989) were produced by the injection of purified histidine-tagged fragments into rabbits (50 μg per boost; a boost every 3 weeks). His-tagged hINADl and Mupp1 were also coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads to purify the respective polyclonal antibodies. His-tagged hINADl and Mupp1 were obtained by subcloning the 10–130 or 800–1000 fragments of hINADl and the 787–989 fragment of Mupp1 in pQE-30 vector from Quiagen (Chestwort, CA) and expression in M15 Escherichia coli, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Caco-2 cells were obtained from Dr. A. Zweibaum (Villejuif, France) and grown as described (22Garcia M. Mirre C. Quaroni A. Reggio H. Le Bivic A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with neomycin (0.25 mg/ml) when transfected. Caco-2 and HeLa cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics), and positive clones were isolated using 1 mg/ml of G418 and tested for expression by immunofluorescence after sodium butyrate induction (10 mm, 16 h). The same protocol of transfection was used for transient expression in MDCK cells without sodium butyrate treatment. hINADl (locus 47) and Mupp1 cDNAs were cloned by RT-PCR using the Superscript kit (Invitrogen) and Caco-2 and HeLa total RNAs, respectively. PCR amplification was performed with the High Fidelity Polymerase (Roche Diagnostics). hINADl constructs tagged with a Myc epitope were obtained by PCR, subcloned in bicistronic pIRES1-neo (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA), and re-sequenced entirely. The chimera construct dCrumbs-VSV-G was obtained by amplifying a C-terminal dCrumbs fragment containing the stalk region, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain of dCrumbs (amino acids 2074–2146) and cloning it into the pUC19 vector containing the VSV-G tag (a gift from Dr. P. Boquet, Nice, France). This fusion construct was subsequently subcloned into theEcoRI-BamHI sites of pIRES1neo vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). Human Crumbs cytoplasmic domains were amplified with the High Fidelity polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) using the following primers: ATTGTTGCTTCTGTTGTCACCT (forward) and CTAAATCAGTCTCTCCATTGC (reverse) for CRB1, CTCCTTTCAGGGATCCTGGCAG (forward) and CTAGATGAGTCTCTCCTCCGGT (reverse) for CRB2, GCTGTGGGGCTGGCACTGTTGGTG (forward) and TCAGATGAGCCGCTCTTCCGGC (reverse) for CRB3. PCR products were sequenced to verify the identity of the amplified products. Cells were grown on glass coverslips and processed as described (23Breuza L. Fransen J. Le Bivic A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1239-C1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy analysis was performed using a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM 410 invert). For immunoelectron microscopy, ultrathin frozen sections of Caco-2 cells and human colon were obtained and processed as described (24Saito H. Santoni M.J. Arsanto J.P. Jaulin-Bastard F., Le Bivic A.

Northern blots were performed as previously described (25Delgrossi M.H. Breuza L. Mirre C. Chavrier P. Le Bivic A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2207-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using human poly(A) RNA from CLONTECH, whereas total cellular RNA was extracted from Caco-2 cells using RNAzol (Bioprobe, Montreuil-sous-Bois, France). Immunoblots and immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described (26Le Bivic A. Real F.X. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9313-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 20 mm TRIS, pH 7.5, 240 mm NaCl, 50 mmKCl, 4 mm EGTA, 4 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100 (buffer N) at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer N and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To find potential functional human homologs of Dlt we searched for proteins with a PDZ domain resembling the first PDZ domain of Dlt, which is involved in Drosophila Crumbs interaction (2Bhat M.A. Izaddoost S., Lu, Y. Cho K.O. Choi K.W. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We found two human proteins, hINADl (20Philipp S. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Mupp1 (19Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lubbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), with a PDZ domain (PDZ2) that is highly conserved (84% similarity) (Fig.1). Both proteins only possess PDZ domains (8 and 13, respectively), suggesting that they act, similar to Dlt, as scaffold proteins with no enzymatic activities. The first five PDZ domains of hINADl and Mupp1 are aligned, whereas the PDZ domains 6, 7, and 8 of hINADl resemble PDZ domains 7, 8, and 10 of Mupp1, respectively. The tissue distribution of Mupp1 in human has been previously reported (19Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lubbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and a 8.5-kb mRNA is present in heart, brain, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. Moreover two other transcripts of 5 and 4 kb are also present in some of these tissues. We performed a similar analysis of hINADl distribution in human tissues and found that a major transcript of 7 kb was expressed in the bladder, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas (Fig. 2). A smaller transcript of 4.1 kb was also detected in testis. In Caco-2 cells at least 3 transcripts (7, 4.1, and 3 kb) were detected, indicating that indeed several forms of hINADl were expressed in cells derived from human colon.Figure 2Tissue expression of hINADl.A, hINADl probe (base pairs 2400–3000) was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. This was then used to probe human tissue Northern blot membranes (CLONTECH) and Caco-2 RNAs. B, membranes were stripped and re-probed with control probe for actin generated by the same method. Molecular mass markers are indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because nothing is known about the cellular role or distribution of hINADl, we produced antibodies against the bridge region (amino acids 800–1000) between PDZ domains 5 and 6, which is the least conserved region of this protein, and against the N-terminal domain (amino acids 10–130) (Fig. 1). Antibodies were affinity-purified using injected protein fragments and tested by Western blotting on total lysates from epithelial cell lines and human colon. Using antibodies against the 800–1000 domain, hINADl offered a complex pattern with several species both in HeLa and Caco-2 cells and also in human colon (Fig. 3, A and C). The main species were 230, 200, and 135 kDa (some of them were doublets; 230 and 135 kDa, in particular), and the 75-kDa species was detected mostly in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3 C). The antibodies against the N-terminal region recognized the high molecular mass bands (230, 200, and 135 kDa in particular) (Fig.3 B), suggesting that the 75-kDa species has a different site for initiation of translation. All of these different molecular masses most likely represent isoforms of hINADl because we discovered in the cDNA data libraries at least six isoforms either with alternative splicing or with different initiation sites for translation (not shown). To support this hypothesis some of these transcripts are tissue-specific (27Soejima H. Kawamoto S. Akai J. Miyoshi O. Arai Y. Morohka T. Matsuo S. Niikawa N. Kimura A. Okubo K. Mukai T. Genomics. 2001; 74: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and we detected at least three transcripts in Caco-2 cells by Northern blotting and many alternative spliced forms by RT-PCR (not shown). We cannot exclude, however, that some of the bands are natural or experimental degradation products. This hypothesis is not supported by the fact that when we expressed cells a full-length hINADl tagged with a Myc epitope in Caco-2 we only observed one band with few degradation products, using the anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 3 B). It is worth noting that instead of migrating at a predicted molecular mass of 170 kDa the Myc-hINADl construct migrated at about 230 kDa, which could be because of a particular shape or stable association with another cellular component. Furthermore, both antibodies raised against hINADl strongly recognized the same 230-kDa band in transfected cells, indicating that our antibodies indeed recognized hINADl (shown for the N-terminal antibodies in Fig. 3 B, N-ter). Thus, there must be a complex regulation of hINADl gene products in epithelial cells, but we do not yet know its functional consequences. Subsequently we tested the membrane association of hINADl with the prediction that a potential functional homolog of Dlt should be membrane-associated because Dlt itself is found predominantly in the membrane fraction derived fromDrosophila S2 cells. 2E. Médina and A. Le Bivic, unpublished results. All isoforms of hINADl were found associated with the membrane fraction of Caco-2 and human colon cells (Fig. 3 C) with the exception of the 75-kDa form, which was also found in the cytosol. Purified antibodies were used to localize hINADl in Caco-2 cells (Fig.4 A) and in MDCK cells (Fig.4 B). When Caco-2 cells were grown in subconfluent cultures we observed that hINADl was recruited early at cell-cell contacts indicating that it might associate with cell-cell junctions (not shown). In confluent cells, hINADl co-localized with occludin, a marker of TJs in epithelial cells (28Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar), and with DPPIV, a marker of the apical membrane of intestinal cells (29Quaroni A. Isselbacher K.J. Dev. Biol. 1985; 111: 267-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). No co-localization was observed with a basolateral marker, Ag525 (21Le Bivic A. Bosc-Biern I. Reggio H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 113-120PubMed Google Scholar). This distribution was also observed in MDCK cells with the antibody against the first 10–130 residues, confirming that the endogenous protein recognized was hINADl (Fig.4 B). The same pattern of labeling was seen on sections of human colon indicating that hINADl was associated with the apical plasma membrane and the tight junctions complex in vivo (not shown). To better evaluate the relationship between hINADl and TJs, we performed immunolocalization experiments with gold particles on ultrathin frozen sections of Caco-2 cells and human colon (Fig.4 C). In both cell types, hINADl was clearly associated with tight junctions, often with the apical side, and was also localized beneath the apical plasma membrane and in the microvilli. Double staining using a monoclonal antibody against occludin confirmed that the two proteins were indeed located in close proximity, confirming that hINADl was associated with TJs (Fig. 4 C). To determine whether it was indeed hINADl that was enriched in the TJs and not a protein cross-reacting with the antibodies, a full-length construct coding for hINADl and tagged with a Myc epitope was transiently expressed in Caco-2 cells and localized using the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody. When expressed at moderate levels, this construct concentrated at the TJs where it co-localized with ZO-1 (Fig.5 B), confirming that hINADl is part of the TJs complex. We next evaluated the impact of overexpression of Myc-hINADl on the integrity of TJs in epithelial cells. For this, we transiently transfected MDCKII cells reaching confluence with Myc-hINADl or with a form in which the first five PDZ domains were deleted (F2 construct) (Fig. 5 A). In cells overexpressing Myc-hINADl the labeling of ZO-1 and ZO-3 was disrupted leading to partial or total loss of peripheral staining (Fig.6). Polarity of apical (BC44) or basolateral (BC11) markers and of γ-catenin was not altered (not shown). These data indicate that cell polarity and adhesion were not affected by these levels of overexpression. No disruption of the ZO-1 and ZO-3 staining was observed with the F2 construct under the same conditions (not shown). Thus, association of at least two molecules of the TJs was impaired, but the overall structure of epithelial cell architecture was preserved.Figure 6Overexpression of hINADl-Myc in MDCK cells. hINADl-Myc was transiently expressed in MDCK cells, and the cells were double-labeled with the anti-Myc (shown in green) and the anti-ZO-1 or anti-ZO-3 antibodies (shown in red).A, X-Y confocal sections show that cells overexpressing hINADl-Myc have a disrupted distribution of ZO-3 (arrows) when compared with non-expressing cells. An arrowheadindicates remaining spots of labeling at the level of TJs.B, Z confocal sections show that cells overexpressing hINADl-Myc have a disrupted distribution of ZO-1 and ZO-3 (arrows) when compared with non-expressing cells.Arrowheads indicate TJs. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next tested whether hINADl is a potential homolog of Dlt in mammalian epithelial cells by investigating its capacity to interact with theDrosophila Crumbs. We designed a construct in which the extracellular domain of Drosophila Crumbs was replaced by a VSV-G epitope leaving only the stalk region, the transmembrane, and the cytoplasmic domains (see Fig.7 A). When this dCrumbs-VSV-G was expressed in HeLa cells, it was transported to the plasma membrane (not shown) and thus could be used to study potential interactions with hINADl. dCrumbs-VSV-G was immunoprecipitated from two independent stable clones using the P5D4 antibody against the VSV-G epitope. Immunoprecipitates were then probed for the presence of hINADl, while untransfected HeLa cells were used as a control (Fig. 7 B). hINADl co-immunoprecipitated specifically with dCrumbs-VSV-G, indicating that it could interact like Dlt does with Crumbs inDrosophila (2Bhat M.A. Izaddoost S., Lu, Y. Cho K.O. Choi K.W. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14Klebes A. Knust E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 76-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Because the interaction between dCrumbs and Dlt involves the last amino acids of dCrumbs cytoplasmic tail, we also expressed a truncated mutant of dCrumbs-VSV-G (Fig.7 A). This 8F105 mutant lacks the last 23 residues and acts as a null allele in Drosophila (30Wodarz A. Grawe F. Knust E. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As expected, dCrumbs-VSV-G 8F105 could not precipitate hINADl, confirming that the interaction between the two proteins involves the distal part of the dCrumbs cytoplasmic domain. The full-length Myc-tagged hINADl was also co-expressed as a control and was precipitated with anti-VSV-G antibodies, confirming that it is hINADl indeed that interacts with dCrumbs and not a protein recognized by cross-reacting antibodies (Fig.7 B). As yet no human Crumbs expressed in epithelial cells has been discovered, so we searched human Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) databases with the cytoplasmic tail of Drosophila Crumbs and found three different human Crumbs (Fig.8 A). One was CRB1 (18den Hollander A.I. ten Brink J.B. de Kok Y.J. van Soest S. van den Born L.I. van Driel M.A. van de Pol D.J. Payne A.M. Bhattacharya S.S. Kellner U. Hoyng C.B. Westerveld A. Brunner H.G. Bleeker- Wagemakers E.M. Deutman A.F. Heckenlively J.R. Cremers F.P. Bergen A.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), whereas the other two are new gene products and were named, respectively, CRB2 and CRB3. They all share the conserved motif around tyrosine 10 (starting from the membrane) and the four last amino acids, ERLI, essential for dCrumbs function in Drosophila (14Klebes A. Knust E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 76-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Using specific primers for each human Crumbs, we performed RT-PCR with total RNA from Caco-2 cells (Fig. 8 B) and found that CRB3 was expressed in these cells and could be the endogenous partner of hINADl in colon epithelial cells. We therefore expressed a chimera containing the epitope VSV-G as an extracellular domain, the transmembrane domain of dCrumbs, and CRB3 cytoplasmic domain. This construct was able to co-immunoprecipitate Myc-hINADl when co-expressed in COS-7 cells although a construct deleted of the last four amino acids, ERLI, did not (Fig. 8 C). Thus CRB3 can interact with hINADl in cellulo. To better define the domain of hINADl that interacts with CRB3 we next co-expressed two constructs of Myc-hINADl deleted either of the first N-terminal 125 amino acids (ΔN-ter) or the PDZ2 domain (ΔPDZ2). To our surprise VSV-G-CRB3 was still able to interact with ΔPDZ2 but not with ΔN-ter, demonstrating that the interaction between hINADl and CRB3 was not mediated by an hINADl PDZ domain as was suggested for dCrumbs and Dlt (2Bhat M.A. Izaddoost S., Lu, Y.

This is the first time since 1914 that a newly described extant insect taxon has proved unplaceable within a recognized order. Mantophasmatodeans are apterous carnivores. Their closest phylogenetic relationships may be to Grylloblattodea (ice-crawlers) and/or Phasmatodea (stick insects), but the morphological evidence is ambiguous. Raptophasma Zompro from Baltic amber is assigned to the Mantophasmatodea, revealing a wider previous range for the lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2040661435,"The ability of insulin to suppress gluconeogenesis in type II diabetes mellitus is impaired; however, the cellular mechanisms for this insulin resistance remain poorly understood. To address this question, we generated transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene under control of its own promoter. TG mice had increased basal hepatic glucose production (HGP), but normal levels of plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) and whole-body glucose disposal during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp compared with wild-type controls. The steady-state levels of PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase mRNAs were elevated in livers of TG mice and were resistant to down-regulation by insulin. Conversely, GLUT2 and glucokinase mRNA levels were appropriately regulated by insulin, suggesting that insulin resistance is selective to gluconeogenic gene expression. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, and associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase were normal in TG mice, whereas IRS-2 protein and phosphorylation were down-regulated compared with control mice. These results establish that a modest (2-fold) increase in PEPCK gene expression in vivo is sufficient to increase HGP without affecting FFA concentrations. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that PEPCK overexpression results in a metabolic pattern that increases glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA and results in a selective decrease in IRS-2 protein, decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, and reduced ability of insulin to suppress gluconeogenic gene expression. However, acute suppression of HGP and glycolytic gene expression remained intact, suggesting that FFA and/or IRS-1 signaling, in addition to reduced IRS-2, plays an important role in downstream insulin signal transduction pathways involved in control of gluconeogenesis and progression to type II diabetes mellitus.

Hyperglycemia develops for reasons that are not completely understood; however, a prominent defect is the inability of insulin to inhibit hepatic glucose production (HGP).1 Increased gluconeogenesis is believed to be the major cause of increased HGP and fasting hyperglycemia in type II diabetes mellitus patients (1Roden M. Petersen K.F. Shulman G.I. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Gluconeogenesis is a highly regulated process, catalyzed by several enzymes subject to regulation by insulin. The first site of regulation, the conversion of oxalacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). PEPCK is considered a key rate-controlling enzyme in the pathway of gluconeogenesis from pyruvate, lactate, and alanine (2Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Normally, insulin rapidly and substantially inhibits PEPCK gene transcription and gluconeogenesis in liver and in rat hepatoma cells. However, in several animal models of obesity and type II diabetes, gluconeogenesis and PEPCK mRNA are increased by 2–3-fold over non-diabetic animals, despite circulating insulin levels that may be 4–10-fold greater than those in non-diabetic controls (3Friedman J.E.

John Libbey & Co., Philadelphia1988: 304-315Google Scholar). These results suggest that hyperglycemia in these animal models might be secondary to insulin signaling defects resulting in lack of suppression of PEPCK gene transcription. In addition to regulating glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes in the liver, insulin controls gluconeogenesis by regulating the concentration of plasma free fatty acids (FFAs). The liver has a high capacity to remove FFAs from the portal circulation. The main function of increased FFAs during fasting is to generate the ATP necessary to shift the equilibrium of the tricarboxylic acid cycle toward the net synthesis of glucose from pyruvate. Although clinical studies support the stimulatory effects of FFAs, particularly derived from visceral lipolysis, on HGP and insulin resistance (6Rebrin K. Steil G.M. Getty L. Bergman R.N. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1038-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 7Rebrin K. Steil G.M. Mittelman S.D. Bergman R.N. J. Clin.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the major intrahepatic mechanism(s) underlying the failure of insulin to suppress gluconeogenesis in type II diabetes remains elusive. Insulin also decreases transcription of the gluconeogenic genes encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase while increasing the expression of the glycolytic enzymes glucokinase and pyruvate kinase. Targeted overexpression or gene knockouts of PEPCK, glucose-6-phosphatase, glucokinase, and GLUT2 (glucosetransporter-2) demonstrate that altered enzyme expression in the liver can play a major regulatory role in hepatic metabolism and whole-animal glucose homeostasis (10Valera A.

However, a detailed study of the role of extracellular FFAs and the ability of insulin to suppress HGP in vivo has not been carried out in most of these transgenic models. It is important to recognize that gluconeogenesis is a coordinated pathway and that sites other than genes encoding gluconeogenesis may also contribute to hepatic insulin resistance to suppress HGP. For example, recent studies have suggested that hepatic insulin resistance might be associated with a loss of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity (15Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). A crucial feature of this hypothesis is that hyperinsulinemia normally suppresses IRS-2 transcription, and when IRS-2 is down-regulated by chronic hyperinsulinemia or gene knockout, there is a loss of insulin regulation of HGP (16Previs S.F. Withers D.J. Ren J.M. White M.F. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38990-38994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 17Shimomura I. Matsuda M. Hammer R.E.

This creates a paradox in that down-regulation of IRS-2 expression by insulin must be intact to suppress its mRNA, whereas PEPCK is inappropriately elevated despite hyperinsulinemia. A previous study by Valera et al. (10Valera A. Pujol A. Pelegrin M. Bosch F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9151-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mice overexpressing a PEPCK minigene driven by the PEPCK promoter develop fasting hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and impaired glucose tolerance. Although these results suggest that solely increasing PEPCK activity in the liver can result in hyperinsulinemia, β-cell failure, and diabetes, it is unclear whether this is due to a failure of insulin to suppress insulin signal transduction in the liver, a defect in insulin suppression of lipolysis, or a secondary effect of hyperglycemia on skeletal muscle glucose uptake. In mice with a liver-specific insulin receptor knockout, a loss of insulin signaling was associated with a 5-fold increase in IRS-2, elevated PEPCK, and mild fasting hyperglycemia (19Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N. Postic C. Previs S.F. Shulman G.I. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, basal HGP was actuallydecreased in the liver-specific insulin receptor knockout mice compared with controls, due perhaps to 20-fold higher insulin levels that significantly suppressed serum triglycerides and FFAs. Thus, deregulation of several systemic components of the gluconeogenic pathway may play an important role in increased HGP of diabetes. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism(s) whereby overexpression of PEPCK impairs the ability of insulin to suppress HGP. In particular, we considered the role of regulation of hepatic genes by insulin and the signal transduction pathways that mediate these responses. We show that a modest (2-fold) increase in PEPCK gene expression is sufficient to increase basal HGP and to trigger impaired glucose tolerance, hallmarks of type II diabetes mellitus, without affecting plasma FFA concentrations. Our results also establish that PEPCK overexpression results in a metabolic pattern that increases glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) mRNA expression in the livers of transgenic (TG) mice and that results in a selective decrease in IRS-2 protein, decreased PI3K activity, and reduced ability of insulin to suppress gluconeogenic gene expression. However, the acute suppressive effects of insulin on HGP, FFAs, and other genes appear to be intact in TG mice, suggesting that a select modification of metabolic pathways occurs in response to increased gluconeogenic gene expression. The PEPCK promoter has been used by numerous investigators to drive overexpression of foreign genes in the livers of transgenic mice. Our constructs are similar to previous PEPCK gene constructs used routinely at the Ohio University Edison Biotechnology Institute and in other laboratories to generate transgenic mice (10Valera A.

The PEPCK gene was coupled to aSmaI-EcoRI polyadenylation signal from the bovine growth hormone gene (see Fig. 1 A) (24Pfarr D.S. Rieser L.A. Woychik R.P. Rottman F.M. Rosenberg M. Reff M.E. DNA (N.

Founder transgenic mice were bred with non-transgenic B6/SJL mice to generate male and female heterozygous mice. Heterozygous males and females from each line were bred to homozygosity and propagated up to four generations. The presence of the transgene was determined by PCR analysis of genomic DNA obtained from tail biopsy and confirmed by Southern blotting. Age-matched 10–14-week-old wild-type (WT) littermates were used as controls. WT and TG mice were housed in microisolator cages and maintained on a fixed 12-h light/dark cycle. Animals had free access to water and were fed regular animal chow (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) ad libitum. The normal mouse chow diet used in these studies was Teklad F6 8664, containing 24% protein, 6% fat, 4.5% crude fiber, and the remainder carbohydrate. Studies were performed as described previously (25Wang L. Shao J. Muhlenkamp P. Liu S. Klepcyk P. Ren J. Friedman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14173-14181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For several days before each study, mice were accustomed to handling. Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 10% d-glucose (2 g/kg of body weight) for glucose tolerance testing. Blood (5–10 μl) was sampled from the tail vein and assayed for glucose and insulin at the times shown, without re-clipping of the tail. Mice underwent a two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp usingd-[3-3H]glucose to measure the rate of appearance of glucose, HGP, and total body glucose utilization according to Ren et al. (26Ren J.M. Marshall B.A. Mueckler M.M. McCaleb M. Amatruda J.M. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 429-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as reported previously by us (25Wang L. Shao J.

Three days after jugular catheter placement, a bolus followed by constant d-[3-3H]glucose infusion was maintained throughout the study. The first step was initiated with an insulin infusion (regular human; Lilly) at 5 milliunits/kg/min, and a variable unlabeled glucose (25% dextrose) infusion was used to maintain glucose levels at 100 ± 10 mg/dl. At least 90 min after initiation of the insulin infusion and at least 30 min after the glucose infusion rate was stable, 70 μl of whole blood was obtained for glucose, insulin, FFA, and radioactivity determination. The rate of appearance of glucose (R a ), which is equal to glucose utilization (R d ) at steady state, was determined by dividing the infusion rate of labeled glucose by the specific radioactivity at the same time. Endogenous glucose production was determined by subtracting the unlabeled glucose infusion rate fromR a . The second step of the study was initiated by increasing the insulin infusion rate to 20 milliunits/kg/min. Similar procedures were followed as outlined for the first step. After completing the second step, the animals were killed by overdose of anesthetic (ketamine), and tissues were removed, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. The rate of glucose appearance (R a ; mg/kg/min), which equals the rate of total body glucose utilization (R d ) during steady state, was calculated as the ratio of the rate of infusion of [3-3H]glucose (dpm/min) and the steady-state plasma [3H]glucose specific radioactivity (dpm/μmol). The rate of HGP (mg/kg/min) during the insulin clamp was calculated as the difference between the tracer-derived R a and the rate of the unlabeled glucose infusion. To observe the effects of PEPCK overexpression on insulin signal transduction, insulin (1 milliunits/kg of body weight) was administered to anesthetized mice via the portal vein as outlined previously (28Yamashita H. Shao J. Ishizuka T. Klepcyk P.J. Muhlenkamp P. Qiao L. Hoggard N. Friedman J.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2888-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Liver samples were removed within 2 min and compared with livers obtained from anesthetized mice after an overnight fast. Samples were stored at –80 °C until analysis. For insulin receptor (IR)-β, IRS-1, IRS-2, and p85α analysis, frozen samples were homogenized in 10 volumes of solubilization buffer and centrifuged for 1 h, and the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis using methods described previously (25Wang L. Shao J. Muhlenkamp P. Liu S. Klepcyk P. Ren J. Friedman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14173-14181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The level of tyrosine phosphorylation was determined after immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, followed by Western blot analysis using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-IR, anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, and anti-p85α antibodies. IRS-1- and IRS-2-associated PI3K activity was measured in extracts after immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C (400 μg of muscle protein/4 μg of antibody), followed by overnight incubation with protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitation complex was spun at 14,000 × g for 10 min, followed by washing three times with isotonic phosphate-buffered saline. The PI3K reaction contained 10 μl of ATP mixture with 100 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.55 mmATP, and 1 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP added for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 20 μl of 8 nHCl and, 5 min later, 160 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1). The phases were separated by centrifugation, and the lower organic phase was removed, lyophilized to dryness, and resuspended in 15 μl of ethanol. The lipids were resolved on a layered TLC plate precoated with 1% potassium oxalate, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. The images were quantified using a Kodak Dynamic Phosphoimager, and results (in duplicate) are expressed as % stimulation over basal (arbitrary units) relative to the WT control. Total RNA was extracted from the livers of fasted control and insulin-clamped animals using the guanidine thiocyanate procedure as described (25Wang L. Shao J. Muhlenkamp P. Liu S. Klepcyk P. Ren J. Friedman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14173-14181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 20 μg of RNA/sample was loaded onto a 0.66 m formaldehyde-containing 1.4% agarose gel in 1× MOPS buffer and size-fractionated by electrophoresis. RNA was transferred overnight to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences ) and UV-cross-linked in a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Prehybridization was done at 65 °C for 2 h in Church's buffer. Random-primed labeling (kit from Invitrogen) was used to generate 32P-labeled cDNA (106 dpm/μg). The probes used were PEPCK, GLUT2, G6Pase, and glucokinase as previously described (25Wang L. Shao J. Muhlenkamp P. Liu S. Klepcyk P. Ren J. Friedman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14173-14181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After hybridization overnight at 65 °C, the membrane was washed 3 × 5 min with 2× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and 2 × 30 min with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The membrane was then exposed to a PhosphorImager cassette overnight. For reprobing, the blots were stripped at 80 °C in 1% glycerol until no counts remained. For quantitative analysis, the intensity of the hybridized band was scanned using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and densitometric values were quantified using ImageQuant software. Densitometric values were normalized to mouse rRNA (28 S) to account for loading differences. Blood taken from the tails was centrifuged, and plasma was separated and frozen. Plasma concentrations of FFAs and leptin were measured with diagnostic reagent kits from Wako Bioproducts and LINCO Research (St. Charles, MO), respectively. Insulin and corticosterone levels in plasma were determined using radioimmunoassay kits from LINCO Research and ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). Lactate was measured using an enzymatic kit from Sigma. Plasma and liver homogenate triglycerides were measured with a semi-enzymatic quantitative assay kit from Sigma. Statistical comparisons between groups were made using Student's t test or analysis of variance where appropriate. To determine the potential role of PEPCK overexpression in hepatic glucose output and gene regulation in vivo, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing the PEPCK gene under control of its own promoter. Transgene expression in this model is directed by 460 bp of the 5′-regulatory region of the PEPCK promoter and has been found to contain all of the necessary elements for developmental, hormonal (including cAMP, insulin, and glucocorticoids), and dietary control in the liver in a manner similar to the endogenous PEPCK gene promoter (3Friedman J.E.

Three founder transgenic mouse lines were bred to homozygosity. Growth curves and body weights in TG and WT mice were similar throughout postnatal development on a normal chow diet (data not shown). Northern blot analysis of their livers at 10 weeks of age showed a 2-fold increase (p < 0.05) in PEPCK mRNA in TG mice compared with WT controls (Fig.1 A). The transgene had no significant effect on levels of PEPCK mRNA expressed in the kidney compared with WT mice (data not shown). TableI provides a summary of metabolic parameters in WT and TG mice assayed under fasting conditions. Fasting plasma glucose levels were unchanged; however, TG mice had a 3-fold increase in fasting insulin levels (p < 0.05). Among the factors that promote gluconeogenesis, plasma FFA and corticosterone values were not different between groups; however, the gluconeogenic precursor lactate was 20% lower in TG mice (p < 0.05). Hepatic and circulating triglyceride levels were normal in TG mice.Table IMetabolic characteristics of WT and PEPCK-TG miceWTTGBody weight (g)24.8 ± 1.424.4 ± 1.7Glucose (mg/dl)100 ± 9108 ± 5Insulin (ng/ml)1.8 ± 0.24.2 ± 0.21-aSignificantly different (p < 0.05).FFAs (mm)0.68 ± 0.080.63 ± 0.05Lactate (mg/dl)26.3 ± 3.321.0 ± 0.951-aSignificantly different (p < 0.05).Corticosterone (ng/ml)28.2 ± 10.724.1 ± 14.6Plasma triglycerides (mg/dl)67.7 ± 10.174.3 ± 13.1Hepatic triglycerides (mg/g liver)35.3 ± 7.434.5 ± 6.6Mice were killed after a 6-h fast.

Open table in a new tab Mice were killed after a 6-h fast. Basal levels of plasma corticosterone and insulin were measured by radioimmunoassay. Results are means ± S.E. of 6–12 animals/group. Increased fasting insulin levels in TG mice suggested that the mice were insulin-resistant. Glucose tolerance tests were therefore carried out in 6-h fasted mice (Fig. 1, B and C). The levels of glucose were significantly elevated in TG mice throughout the glucose tolerance test (p < 0.01), whereas insulin levels were increased at time 0 and at 30 min, suggestive of glucose intolerance. To further delineate the source of the insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies were performed usingd-[3-3H]glucose to measure HGP and total body glucose utilization under steady-state conditions (Fig.2). Under basal conditions prior to the insulin clamp, HGP was 35% greater in TG mice (p < 0.05). However, during low-dose insulin infusion at the same plasma insulin concentration, HGP was suppressed by similar absolute amounts in WT and TG mice (WT = 8.1 ± 2.98 versus TG = 8.9 ± 1.98 mg/kg/min), although the rate of HGP was still significantly elevated by 37% in TG mice (p < 0.05). Under high-dose hyperinsulinemic conditions, insulin suppressed HGP to nearly zero in WT and TG mice. The rate of steady-state whole-body glucose disposal (R d ; mg/kg/min) measured during the clamp was similar in TG mice compared with WT controls in response to low- and high-dose insulin infusion, suggesting that insulin resistance is not present in muscle. Increased basal HGP in TG mice could result from a reduced ability of insulin to alter enzymatic machinery and/or from an increased availability of substrates and FFA levels. Both circulating non-esterified plasma FFAs and leptin have marked stimulatory effects on gluconeogenesis (29Barzilai N. She L. Liu B.Q. Vuguin P. Cohen P. Wang J. Rossetti L.

After 3.5 h of hyperinsulinemia, FFA levels fell by a similar absolute amount in WT and TG mice, suggesting that the effect of insulin to suppress plasma FFA levels is unchanged in PEPCK-overexpressing mice.Table IIPlasma concentrations of free fatty acids and leptin at base line and following hyperinsulinemic clamp studiesPrePostFFAs (mm) WT1.01 ± 0.060.13 ± 0.07 TG0.88 ± 0.080.11 ± 0.10Leptin (ng/ml) WT1.2 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.2 TG1.1 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.1Mice were chronically catheterized and glucose-maintained between 90 and 110 mg/dl during the insulin clamp by determining glucose every 10 min and adjusting the rate of unlabeled glucose infusion (20% glucose) to maintain euglycemia.

https://openalex.org/W2007852796,"Numerous inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) are being developed in view of their potential applications against cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Among these, paullones constitute a family of potent and apparently selective cyclin-dependent kinase and GSK-3 inhibitors. However, their actual intracellular targets remain to be identified. To address this issue we have immobilized a paullone, gwennpaullone, on an agarose matrix. Extracts from various cell types and tissues were screened for proteins interacting with this matrix. This approach validated GSK-3α and GSK-3β as major intracellular paullone targets and also mitochondrial, but not cytoplasmic, malate dehydrogenase (MDH). Mitochondrial MDH was indeed inhibited by micromolar concentrations of paullones. Mitochondrial MDH was the major paullone-binding protein in the parasitic protozoon Leishmania mexicana, and paullones inhibited growth of the parasite. This simple batchwise affinity chromatography approach constitutes a straightforward method for the identification of intracellular targets of this particular class of novel anti-mitotic compounds. It has revealed an unexpected target, mitochondrial MDH, the inhibition of which may participate in the pharmacological effects of paullones.

Commun. 2001; 280: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The selectivity of these inhibitors constitutes a major problem. This question is usually approached by testing the compounds on a panel of purified, usually recombinant, kinases. This approach is rather unsatisfactory for several reasons. First, it requires the expression, purification, and assay of each individual kinase, a very tedious process. Second, only a limited number (from 5 to 40) of kinases can be reasonably tested. This represents a very minor subset of the estimated total number of kinases in the human genome (>800). Third, other potential, non-kinase targets are not evaluated. For these reasons another method for investigating the selectivity of a given inhibitor has been designed (24Knockaert M. Gray N. Damiens E. Chang Y.T. Grellier P. Grant K. Fergusson D. Mottram J. Soete M. Dubremetz J.F. LeRoch K. Doerig C. Schultz P.G. Meijer L. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is based on the purification of potential targets by affinity chromatography. Basically, the inhibitor is immobilized on an agarose matrix through a linker. The choice of the inhibitor orientation with respect to the matrix is derived from the co-crystal structure of the inhibitor with CDK2, which shows the area of the inhibitor that is orientated toward the outside of the enzyme, the area where the linker should be attached. Extracts are prepared from tissues or cells and incubated with the affinity beads. The matrix is then washed, and the bound proteins are analyzed by SDS-PAGE and identified by microsequencing. This approach has allowed the discovery of several unexpected targets of purvalanol (24Knockaert M. Gray N. Damiens E. Chang Y.T. Grellier P. Grant K. Fergusson D. Mottram J. Soete M. Dubremetz J.F.

Paullones have been identified as CDK1/CDK2/CDK5 inhibitors using the COMPARE analysis of a data base of compounds tested in the NCI, National Institutes of Health, in vitro cancer cell line screening (12Zaharevitz D. Gussio R. Leost M. Senderowicz A.M. Lahusen T. Kunick C. Meijer L. Sausville E.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2566-2569PubMed Google Scholar). A structure/activity relationship study has led to the more active compounds kenpaullone and alsterpaullone (11Schultz C. Link A. Leost M. Zaharevitz D.W. Gussio R. Sausville E.A. Meijer L. Kunick C. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). During a classical selectivity study, we found that paullones were also excellent GSK-3 inhibitors (13Leost M. Schultz C. Link A., Wu, Y.-Z. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Greengard P. Zaharevitz D.W. Gussio R. Senderovitz A. Sausville E.A. Kunick C. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5983-5994Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Kenpaullone and alsterpaullone are about 10-fold more potent at inhibiting GSK-3 compared with CDK1 (13Leost M. Schultz C. Link A., Wu, Y.-Z. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Greengard P. Zaharevitz D.W. Gussio R. Senderovitz A. Sausville E.A. Kunick C. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5983-5994Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the true selectivity of paullones needs to be defined. We describe here the synthesis of two paullones with a linker and their immobilization on a matrix. The immobilized gwennpaullone allowed the purification of GSK-3α and GSK-3β from various tissues. Unexpectedly, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH) was identified as another major target of paullones.

The sea urchins Sphaerechinus granularis were obtained by diving in Northern Brittany. Egg spawnings were induced by injection of 0.5 ml of 0.2 macetylcholine through the perribuccal membrane. Eggs were washed 3 times with Millipore-filtered natural seawater, pelleted by centrifugation, and frozen in liquid nitrogen as described previously (29Meijer L. Azzi L. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1545-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Only unfertilized eggs were used in this study. Unfertilized eggs were obtained from femaleXenopus laevis induced to ovulate following injection of 500 units of human chorionic gonadotropin. The eggs were dejellied in 2% cysteine solution (30Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until protein extraction and affinity chromatography. The liver, brain, heart, muscles, lungs, and spleen of mature rats (Rattus norvegicus) were provided by Dr. P. Loyer (INSERM U49, Unité de Recherches Hépatologiques, Hôpital Pontchaillou, Rennes, France). They were stored at −80 °C until protein extraction and affinity chromatography. Pork brains were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and either directly homogenized and processed for affinity chromatography or stored at −80 °C prior to use. The rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 5% horse serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, and gentamycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. PC12 cell pellets were lysed in homogenization buffer just prior to affinity chromatography. L. mexicana mexicana (MNYC/BZ/62/M379) promastigotes were cultured at 25 °C in HOMEM medium, as described previously (31Grant K.M. Hassan P. Anderson J.S. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10153-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), supplemented with 5–10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The parasites were harvested at mid-log phase (5 × 106 to 1 × 107 cells/ml), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellets frozen at −80 °C until required. The cell pellets were extracted with homogenization buffer just prior to affinity chromatography. Tissues were weighed, homogenized, and sonicated in homogenization buffer (2 ml per g of material). Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g and 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered, assayed for protein content (Bio-Rad protein assay), and immediately loaded batchwise on the affinity matrices. Cells were directly sonicated in homogenization buffer and processed the same way. Just before use, 20 μl of packed gwennpaullone beads were washed with 1 ml of bead buffer and resuspended in 600 μl of this buffer. The cell/tissue extract supernatant (2 mg of total protein) was then added; the tubes were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. After a brief spin at 10,000 × g and removal of the supernatant, the beads were washed four times with bead buffer before addition of 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205447) Google Scholar). When larger samples were prepared for microsequencing, up to 30 mg of proteins were incubated with 200–500 μl of packed beads and 25 ml of bead buffer.

Cell extracts (2 mg of total proteins) were incubated with 10 μl of packed beads + 600 μl of bead buffer for 30 min. The beads were processed as described for the gwennpaullone beads. Proteins bound to the paullone matrix, 95-matrix, axin matrix, or p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads were recovered with 2× Laemmli sample buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205447) Google Scholar). Following heat denaturation for 3 min, the bound proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE (0.7 mm thick gels) followed by immunoblotting analysis or silver staining. Silver staining was performed according to a “home recipe” (fixative, 250 μl of 37% formaldehyde in 250 ml of 50% methanol; rinsing with MilliQ water containing 35 μm DTT, followed by 0.1% AgNO3 in MilliQ water (w/v); developer, 12 g of Na2CO3 in 400 ml of MilliQ water containing 200 μl of 37% formaldehyde). When samples were prepared for microsequencing, gels (1.5-mm thick) were stained with Amido Black (3 mg/100 ml methanol/acetic acid/water, 25/5/20). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to 0.1-μm nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). These were blocked with 5% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST), incubated with anti-GSK-3α/β (1/1000; 1 h), anti-sea urchin CDK5 (1/1000; 1 h), anti-mammalian CDK5 (1/500; 1 h) or anti-MDH (1/1000 in 1% BSA in TBST; 1 h) antibodies, and analyzed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). In the case of MDH Western blotting, membranes were blocked with 3% BSA in TBST. Proteins were identified either by Western blotting with specific antibodies or by microsequencing of internal peptides. The Amido Black-stained bands were excised from the gel and dried under vacuum. They were sent to the Pasteur Institute, Protein Sequencing Laboratory, Paris, France (Dr. J. D'Alayer and M. Davi). The proteins were digested with endolysine C, and the generated peptides were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography and microsequenced. Sequences were compared with available protein sequences using Blastp (Blast 2.0). Kinases activities were assayed in buffer C, at 30 °C, at a final ATP concentration of 15 μm. Blank values were subtracted and activities calculated as picomoles of phosphate incorporated for a 10-min incubation and expressed in percent of the maximal activity, i.e. without inhibitors. Controls were performed with appropriate dilutions of Me2SO. IC50 values were estimated from the concentration-response curves. Native starfish oocyte CDK1/cyclin B, recombinant mammalian CDK5/p25 (constructs kindly provided by Dr. J. H. Wang), and recombinant GSK-3β were expressed, purified, and assayed as described previously (6Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P.J. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Histone H1 and GS-1 peptide were used as substrates, for CDKs and GSK-3, respectively. MDH assays were run in a Uvikon 930 spectrophotometer equipped with a constant temperature cell holder maintained at 28 °C. Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic MDH activities were assayed either in the forward direction (malate ⇒ oxaloacetate) or in the reverse direction (oxaloacetate ⇒ malate), by following the increase or decrease in absorption at 340 nm, due to NAD reduction or NADH oxidation, respectively. Assays were run, at 28 °C, in the presence of 100 mm Trizma base, pH 8.5, 500 mm malate, and 16 mm NAD (forward reaction) or 100 mm Trizma base, pH 8.5, 10 mm oxaloacetate, and 16 mmNADH (reverse reaction). The A 340 change was measured against a blank (same mixture of reagents but no enzyme). Reactions were performed in polymethylmethacrylate-disposable cuvettes. Addition of the substrate was used to start the reaction. The amount of MDH was chosen to provide a linear reaction during the first 2.5 min of the reaction. Initial slope rates were used to calculate MDH activities, which are expressed in δA 340/min/μl MDH or as percent of the maximal activity (measured in the absence of inhibitor). Me2SO had no effect on MDH activity at the highest concentration used (5%). Paullones have not been co-crystallized with CDK2. However, they have been docked into the ATP-binding pocket of a homology model of CDK1/cyclin B developed from the crystal structure of CDK2/cyclin A (35Gussio R. Zaharevitz D. McGrath C.F.

This has allowed us to select ring A for attachment of a side chain (Fig. 1) as it appears to be orientated toward the outside of the ATP-binding pocket. Two paullones, analogous to kenpaullone but modified with a side chain on C-2 or C-3, were synthesized (Fig. 1). These two paullones, C-3-paullone and C-2-paullone (gwennpaullone), were tested on CDK1/cyclin B, CDK5/p25, and GSK-3β (TableI). This revealed that both paullones have a strong preference for GSK-3β over CDKs.

Although the signaling pathways activated by these receptors are well characterized, regulation of their activity is poorly understood. To identify regulatory proteins we undertook a two-hybrid screen using the IGF-1R β-chain as bait. This screen identified Receptor for Activated C Kinases (RACK1) as an IGF-1R-interacting protein. RACK1 also interacted with the IGF-1R in fibroblasts and MCF-7 cells and with endogenous insulin receptor in COS cells. Interaction with the IGF-1R did not require tyrosine kinase activity or receptor autophosphorylation but did require serine 1248 in the C terminus. Overexpression of RACK1 in either R+ fibroblasts or MCF-7 cells inhibited IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Akt, whereas it enhanced phosphorylation of Erks and Jnks. Src, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and SHP-2 were all associated with RACK1 in these cells. Interestingly, the proliferation of MCF-7 cells was enhanced by overexpression of RACK1, whereas IGF-1-mediated protection from etoposide killing was greatly reduced.

They are tetrameric receptors made up of two α-subunits that bind the ligands insulin, IGF-1 or IGF-2, and two β-subunits that share high homology in their kinase domains (reviewed in Ref. 1Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar). These receptors are homologous to a receptor found in the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans and inDrosophila, and they activate an evolutionarily conserved metabolic and survival signaling pathway that includes insulin-related substrate 1 (IRS-1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), the serine/threonine kinase Akt, and the Forkhead family of transcription factors (2Tissenbaum H.A.

Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). There is considerable overlap in IR and IGF-1R function. The IR has a primary role in regulating glucose metabolism and also promotes cell survival and growth (1Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar). The IGF-1R can regulate metabolism; it is critical for growth during development; it promotes cell survival, and it has an additional role in facilitating cellular transformation and cancer progression (6Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Cell survival and glucose metabolism are tightly inter-linked, because glucose metabolism is essential for Akt-mediated survival stimulated by IGF-1 and other growth factors (7Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S. Kandel E. Robey R.B. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1406-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar,8Vander Heiden M.G. Plas D.R. Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Mol.

Lack of function of either the IR or the IGF-1R can cause diabetes in mouse models (12Fernandez A.M. Kim J.K. Yakar S. Dupont J. Hernandez-Sanchez C. Castle A.L. Filmore J. Shulman G.I. Le Roith D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1926-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The IGF-1R has a well documented role in cancer development and progression (6Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Signals from the IGF-1R can enhance tumor cell survival and growth and increase expression of genes that mediate invasion and metastasis (6Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 13Blakesley V.A. Stannard B.S. Kalebic T. Helman L.J. LeRoith D. J.

The dependence of tumor cells on IGF-1R function is supported by the observations that inhibition of IGF-1R function by antibodies (15Shapiro D.N. Jones B.G. Shapiro L.H. Dias P. Houghton P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), triple helix formation (16Rininsland F. Johnson T.R. Chernicky C.L. Schulze E. Burfeind P. Ilan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5854-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), or antisense strategies (17Resnicoff M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 883-888PubMed Google Scholar) can reverse the transformed phenotype and lead to cell death. Although there is a huge body of literature focusing on activation of the PI3-K/Akt or other signaling pathway by IGF-1 and insulin, there is a limited understanding of how the activity of the IR and IGF-1R is regulated. Tyrosine phosphatases including LAR and PTP-1B regulate IR kinase activity and glucose metabolism (18Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar, 19Zabolotny J.M. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D.

Recently, we found that PTP-1B can also regulate IGF-1R kinase activity and function in transformed cells (20Buckley D. Cheng A. Kiely P. Trembaly M. O'Connor R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1998-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Another regulatory mechanism for the IR and IGF-1R is proposed to operate through serine phosphorylation of the receptors or IRS-1 (21Zick Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, although specific serines on IRS-1 are associated with inhibition of insulin signaling (21Zick Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), it is not known which serines in the IR or IGF-1R are phosphorylated or how they could negatively regulate the activity of these receptors. It is also not known if there are regulatory mechanisms that act uniquely on the IGF-1R or the IR. Specific regulatory mechanisms could be very important in distinguishing signals necessary for the maintenance of normal cells from those necessary for cancer progression. A hint that the IGF-1R and IR have different signals and regulation came from previous studies with mutants of the IGF-1R (22O'Connor R. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Liu Y. Lehar S. Evan G.I. Baserga R. Blattler W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Miura M. Morrione A. Baserga R.

These indicated that domains of the IGF-IR C terminus with distinct amino acid sequences from similarly located domains in the IR are required for or have a regulatory effect on the anti-apoptotic and transforming activity of the IGF-1R (22O'Connor R. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Liu Y. Lehar S. Evan G.I. Baserga R. Blattler W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Miura M. Morrione A.

The functions of the C terminus in recruiting signaling molecules or regulating receptor function have not yet been elucidated. To address this we undertook a screen for proteins that could interact with the IGF-1R by using the yeast two-hybrid system. In this report we identify RACK1, a homologue of the β-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (26Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 27Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), as an interacting protein for the IGF-IR and IR. RACK1 associated with the IGF-1R and the IR in a tyrosine kinase-independent manner but did not interact with an IGF-1R that had serine 1248 mutated to alanine. Overexpression of RACK1 in R+ fibroblasts or in MCF-7 cells resulted in enhanced receptor kinase activity, phosphorylation of IRS-2 and Shc, as well as enhanced phosphorylation of Erks and JNK. However, IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Akt was greatly inhibited. Interestingly, although RACK1 enhanced the growth rate of MCF-7 cells, it inhibited IGF-1-mediated protection from etoposide killing. Altogether the data indicate that RACK1 interacts with the IGF-1R to negatively regulate activation of the PI3-K pathway. Thus, RACK1 may have a broad role in regulating glucose metabolism and cell survival. Recombinant IGF-1 was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). The anti-IGF-1R and anti-IR, anti-SHP-2, and anti-c-Src polyclonal antibodies and the anti-c-Src monoclonal antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody ND122 was from ImmunoGen (24Liu Y. Lehar S. Corvi C. Payne G. O'Connor R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 570-576PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-phospho-Akt, anti-Akt polyclonal antibodies, and the anti-phospho-p42/44 MAP kinase monoclonal antibody were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, 4G10, the anti-Erk-2, anti-p85, and anti-IRS-2 monoclonal antibodies, and the anti-phospho-Jun and anti-Shc polyclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-Shc and anti-RACK1 monoclonal antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Heidelberg, Germany). The anti-HA antibody, 12CA5, was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and the anti-actin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. The yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out using the reagents and protocols from the MATCHMAKER LexA two-hybrid system (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). To be used as bait, the cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the wild type IGF-1R (amino acids 930–1337 (28Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W., Le Bon T. Kathuria S. Chen E. et al.EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar)) was fused to the LexA sequence in the yeast expression vector pLexA under the control of theADH1 promoter. This plasmid was then transformed into the yeast strain EGY48 (p80P-lacZ), which harbored the lacZreporter plasmid, and transformants were selected using Ura−, His− medium. These yeast cells were subsequently transformed with a cDNA library derived from fetal brain expressed in the pB42AD vector and simultaneously subjected to nutritional selection and selection for growth of clones that had expressed activated LacZ (medium: Ura−, His−, Trp−, leu−, gal+, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal)). Blue colonies that expressed potential interacting proteins were isolated and subjected to further selection for a true interaction using Shc as a positive control for an IGF-1R-interacting protein and for interaction with a kinase-inactive IGF-1R β-chain (K1003A). The yeast plasmid DNA was recovered and transformed into theEscherichia coli strain KC8 by electroporation. The cDNA inserts were subjected to PCR analysis to exclude known IGF-1R-interacting proteins including Grb-10 and p85. Unidentified inserts were then sequenced and compared with the DNA data bases using BLAST analysis. Sequence analysis of the two clones expressing RACK1 in the pB42AD vector revealed that one of them encoded the full-length RACK1 protein. To obtain full-length RACK1 in-frame with the HA epitope tag, oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of RACK1 were designed that incorporated the restriction sites SalI and XbaI, RACK1 forward 5′-TCGGTCGACCCATGACTGAGCAGATG and RACK1 reverse 5′-CATTCTAGACTAGCGTGCCAAT. PCR products were digested withSalI and XbaI and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands of the expected length were cut out and ligated into the pKS vector, which had been digested with SalI andXba. After confirmation of the DNA sequence, RACK1 was liberated from this vector using SalI/XbaI and ligated into a pcDNA3 vector containing the HA-coding sequence that had been digested with XhoI/XbaI. The pcDNA3 vectors encoding IGF-1R full-length receptor, the kinase-dead mutant (K1003R), and the tyrosine 1316 to phenylalanine mutant (Y1316F) were described previously (22O'Connor R. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Liu Y. Lehar S. Evan G.I. Baserga R. Blattler W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The β-chain of the IGF-1R (wild type, K1003R, and Y1316F) was subcloned into the expression vector pIRES (CLONTECH) usingBamHI restriction sites on either end as described previously (20Buckley D. Cheng A. Kiely P. Trembaly M. O'Connor R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1998-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The double tyrosine 1162/1221 to phenylalanine mutant (Y1162F/Y1221F), the serine 1248 to alanine mutant (S1248A), and the serine 1252 to alanine (S1252A) mutant were all generated by site-directed mutagenesis using “The TransformerTM” kit from CLONTECH. The template used was a pKS vector encoding a fragment of the IGF-1R from the unique HindIII restriction site in the kinase domain to the stop codon (20Buckley D. Cheng A. Kiely P. Trembaly M. O'Connor R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1998-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After verification of the sequence of the mutants, the fragments were subcloned into the pIRES expression vector already containing a wild type IGF-1R β-chain sequence by using the HindIII andBamHI restriction sites. Full-length IGF-1R harboring each of these mutations in the pcDNA3 vector was obtained by digestion of pcDNA3 vector expressing wild type IGF-1R withHindIII and BamHI and then replacing it with the fragment containing each mutation. The sequence of all IGF-1R-encoding plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing. A prcCMV plasmid encoding the full-length insulin receptor was kindly provided by Kenneth Siddle, University of Cambridge, UK. The MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line, R− cells (fibroblasts derived from the IGF-1R knock out mouse), R+ cells (R− cells that have been re-transfected with the IGF-1R (29Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar)), and COS cells were all maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Bio-Whittaker, Verviers, Belgium), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 10 mm l-Glu, and 5 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. COS cells or R+ cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3/HA-RACK1 or empty pcDNA3 vectors (4 μg of DNA) using LipofectAMINE Plus, (Invitrogen). After 24 h in culture the transfected R+ cells were split into 6-well plates or 10-cm plates and cultured for an additional 18 h, at which time cells were starved for 3 h and stimulated with IGF-1, and protein extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation or Western blot analyses. To generate stable transfectants of HA-RACK1, MCF-7 cells were transfected as described for R+ cells, but 24 h after transfection cells were split into medium containing G418 (1 mg/ml) and maintained for 14 days, with regular replenishment of medium and drug. At this time individual clones were selected, expanded, and screened for expression of HA Rack by Western blotting. Clones of MCF-7 cells stably overexpressing HA-RACK1 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418. For analysis of signaling responses cells were washed and starved from serum for 3 h. Cellular protein extracts were prepared by washing cells with phosphate-buffered saline and then scraping into lysis buffer consisting of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 plus the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4 (1 mm) and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), pepstatin (1 μm), and aprotinin (1.5 μg/ml). After incubation at 4 °C for 20 min, nuclear and cellular debris were removed by micro-centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous or transfected proteins, protein extracts from stimulated or unstimulated cells were initially pre-cleared using bovine serum albumin-coated protein G-agarose beads (15 μl of beads per 400 μg of total protein in 700 μl of lysis buffer) by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. The lysates were recovered from the beads by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 3 min and transferred to fresh tubes for incubation with primary antibody (3 μg of each antibody) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Immune complexes were obtained by adding 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 3 h at room temperature and were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed (3 times) with ice-cold lysis buffer and then either used for in vitro kinase assay or removed from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. All protein samples for Western blot analysis were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% milk (w/v). All primary antibody incubations were overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody incubations were carried out at room temperature. Where indicated, membranes were stripped by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, 1% SDS, and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C followed by extensive washing in 0.2 and 0.05% TBS-T. Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used for detection with enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal from Pierce) or ECL+ (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturers' instructions. MCF-7 Neo and MCF-7 cells overexpressing HA-RACK1 (clone A1, B1, and C1) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (complete medium) at 3 × 104 cells per well in multiple wells of a 24-well plate. To monitor cell growth at intervals, attached cells were removed from triplicate wells to Eppendorf tubes using trypsin-EDTA and were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 3 min. The cell pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of medium and counted using a hemocytometer and trypan blue exclusion. Data are presented as the mean and S.D. of counts from triplicate wells. To assess cell survival in response to IGF-1 in the presence or absence of the apoptosis-inducing drug etoposide, cells were seeded in complete medium. After 18 h the cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and re-incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with either no additives, with added IGF-1 (100 ng/ml), with etoposide (8.5 μm), or with IGF-1 + etoposide. After a further 36 h in culture, the cells were assessed for viability and cell number in triplicate wells as described for proliferation assays. MCF-7 cells were starved from serum for 4 h and then stimulated with IGF-1 for 0, 15, or 30 min. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-IGF-1R polyclonal antisera as described above. Protein G-agarose complexes obtained from immunoprecipitations were washed in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2) and then resuspended in 25 μl of a kinase reaction mixture containing ATP (0.03 mm final concentration), 2 μl of [32P]ATP (5 μCi/μl), and 2 μl of poly(Glu-Tyr) (Sigma). Following a 20-min incubation period, samples of reaction mixture (5 μl) were removed to fresh tubes containing 9 μl of H2O and 35 μl of 20 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Triplicate samples were then transferred to glass microfiber filters in 24-well plates and washed extensively with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10%) containing 10 mmNa2HPO4. Following a final wash with 70% ethanol, the filters were dried, and 32P was measured in a scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). The data are presented as the mean and S.D. of counts/min for triplicate samples. In order to identify novel IGF-1R-interacting proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the cytoplasmic portion of the IGF-1R β-chain fused to the LexA DNA-binding protein as bait. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that this IGF-1R β-chain was autophosphorylated when expressed in yeast. It could also interact with a series of proteins derived from B cell and HeLa cell cDNA libraries including the p85 subunit or PI3-K, Csk, Grb-10, and Shc, most of which were identified previously (30Arbet-Engels C.

From a screen of a brain-derived cDNA library, the only known protein that interacted with the IGF-1R was a cDNA encoding RACK1/GNB2L1. RACK1 interaction was observed with a kinase-active IGF-1R β-chain in yeast, but unlike Shc, it was also observed with a kinase-inactive (K1003R) mutant of the IGF-1R β-chain (data not shown) RACK1 was originally identified in brain (26Ron D.

A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) and is a known adapter protein for the IFNα receptor (33Usacheva A. Smith R. Minshall R. Baida G. Seng S. Croze E. Colamonici O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22948-22953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It has the potential to interact with several proteins through its 7 WD repeat motifs (34Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). To determine whether RACK1 interacts with the IGF-1R in mammalian cells, the cDNA encoding RACK1 was subcloned in-frame with the epitope tag HA at the N terminus into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. COS cells were then transiently co-transfected with pcDNA3 plasmids encoding either HA-RACK1 or full-length IGF-1R. The IGF-1R was immunoprecipitated from cells using a polyclonal antibody that detects an epitope in its C terminus and was then analyzed for associated HA-RACK1 by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. To determine whether activated PKCs influenced the interaction of RACK1 with the IGF-1R (as it does with PKC and Src (36Ligensa T. Krauss S. Demuth D. Schumacher R. Camonis J. Jaques G. Weidner K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33419-33427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)), the transfected cells were treated with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to activate PKC or were left untreated. The results shown in Fig. 1 A demonstrated that HA-RACK1 was present in the IGF-1R immunoprecipitates at equivalent amounts in the presence or absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This indicates that HA-RACK1 associates with the IGF-1R in COS cells, and this interaction is not altered by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. We next investigated whether endogenous RACK1 interacts with the IGF-1R and how this is affected by ligand stimulation of the IGF-1R. To do this we used R+ cells (R− fibroblasts derived from the IGF-1R knock out mouse) that were re-transfected with the IGF-1R (29Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Cells were starved from serum and then stimulated with IGF-1 for the indicated times, at which times the IGF-1R was immunoprecipitated and assessed for both phosphotyrosine content and associated endogenous cellular RACK1 by Western blotting. As can be seen in Fig. 1 B, RACK1 was associated with the unphosphorylated form of the IGF-1R. Upon IGF-1 stimulation the IGF-1R β-chain underwent autophosphorylation, as detected by phosphotyrosine staining, and similar amounts of RACK1 protein were associated with the phosphorylated receptor. This indicates that RACK1 is associated with the IGF-1R in either the inactive or active state, and this interaction does not require autophosphorylation of the IGF-1R. Several proteins that interact with the IGF-1R also interact with the IR, but there is at least one IGF-1R-interacting protein that was identified in a yeast two-hybrid system that does not interact with the IR (36Ligensa T. Krauss S. Demuth D. Schumacher R. Camonis J. Jaques G. Weidner K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33419-33427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested to determine whether RACK1 could interact with the IR as well as with the IGF-1R. To test this, the endogenous IR or IGF-1R proteins were immunoprecipitated from COS cells, and the immunoprecipitates were investigated for associated endogenous RACK1 by Western blotting. As can be seen in Fig.2 A, RACK1 interacted with both the IR and IGF-1R in COS cells. This suggests that RACK1 interacts with amino acid residues or receptor domains that are common to both the IR and IGF-1R. To investigate further the residues in the IGF-1R necessary for interaction with RACK1, we investigated a series of IGF-1R β-chain mutants transiently expressed in R− fibroblasts. From each transfected cell population, endogenous RACK1 association with the IGF-1R β-chain was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-RACK1 antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B, RACK1 interacted with a wild type IGF-1R β-chain but also with a kinase-inactive (K1003R) mutant of the β-chain. This confirms the result obtained in the yeast two-hybrid system and the observation that RACK1 interacts with un-stimulated IGF-1R (Fig. 1 B). RACK1 also interacted with IGF-1R β-chains containing mutated tyrosines, the Y1316F mutant, or the double tyrosine mutant Y1162F/Y1222F. However, RACK1 did not interact with an IGF-1R β-chain mutated at a C-terminal serine, S1248A, whereas it retained interaction with another β-chain mutated at s"

Many characteristics of pancreatitis can be studied in vitro in pancreatic acini treated with high doses of cholecystokinin (CCK). We show here that CCK stimulates apoptosis and death signaling pathways in rat pancreatic acinar cells, including caspase activation, cytochromec release, and mitochondrial depolarization. The mitochondrial dysfunction is mediated by upstream caspases (possibly caspase-8) and, in turn, leads to activation of caspase-3. CCK causes mitochondrial alterations through both permeability transition pore-dependent (cytochrome c release) and permeability transition pore-independent (mitochondrial depolarization) mechanisms. Caspase activation and mitochondrial alterations also occur in untreated pancreatic acinar cells; however, the underlying mechanisms are different. In particular, caspases protect untreated acinar cells from mitochondrial damage. We found that caspases not only mediate apoptosis but also regulate other parameters of CCK-induced acinar cell injury that are characteristic of pancreatitis; in particular, caspases negatively regulate necrosis and trypsin activation in acinar cells. The results suggest that the observed signaling pathways regulate parenchymal cell injury and death in CCK-induced pancreatitis. Protection against necrosis and trypsin activation by caspases can explain why the severity of pancreatitis in experimental models correlates inversely with the extent of apoptosis.

Of note, in these models an inverse correlation was observed between the extent of apoptosis on the one hand and necrosis and the severity of the disease on the other hand. Many characteristics of pancreatitis can be studied in vitroin isolated pancreatic acini stimulated with supraphysiological doses of CCK, such as up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, and the pathological, intra-acinar cell conversion of trypsinogen to active trypsin (13Gukovsky I.

The latter is considered an important event in the development of pancreatitis because trypsin can cause cell injury and activation of other potentially harmful digestive enzymes in the acinar cell (4Steer M.L.

It remains unknown whether CCK (or cerulein) can directly induce apoptosis in pancreatic acinar cells and, if so, what signaling pathways are involved. A central event in apoptosis is activation of specific cysteine proteases, the caspases (21Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Two major pathways of caspase activation have been identified (21Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol.

One is triggered through “death domain” receptors, such as the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors, and involves the formation of a “death-inducing signaling complex” leading to activation of initiator caspases, i.e.caspase-8 (21Wolf B.B.

Cytochrome c release into the cytosol is necessary for activation of caspase-9, which, in turn, activates the effector caspases. Cytochrome c release may be mediated by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), although the issue is much debated (24Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 25Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar, 26Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev.

Another characteristic of mitochondrial dysfunction is loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, ΔΨm (24Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 25Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial dysfunction can be mediated by upstream caspases. For example, caspase-8 can activate the mitochondrial pathway by cleaving Bid, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family, which then causes cytochrome c release from mitochondria (28Li H. Zhu H., Xu, C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar). This “amplification” pattern of apoptosis is thought to be used by cells that do not have high enough level of death-inducing signaling complex formation and activation of caspase-8 (22Scaffidi C.

However, caspase-3 also can proteolytically activate caspase-8 so that stimuli that directly cause mitochondrial dysfunction may subsequently activate caspase-8 downstream of cytochrome c release (23Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by receptors unrelated to tumor necrosis factor family, in particular, by G protein-coupled receptors. One exception is somatostatin, whose receptor is coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive Go/iprotein (29Reisine T. Woulfe D. Raynor K. Kong H. Heerding J. Hines J. Tallent M. Law S. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 190: 160-167PubMed Google Scholar). Somatostatin was recently shown to stimulate apoptosis in breast cancer cells by recruiting a nonmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, resulting in activation of caspase-8 independent of mitochondria (30Liu D. Martino G. Thangaraju M. Sharma M. Halwani F. Shen S-H. Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9244-9250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the apoptotic pathway activated by somatostatin is unique or is utilized by other G protein-coupled receptors as well. The CCK-A receptor in rodent pancreatic acinar cells is coupled to a pertussis toxin-insensitive Gq protein that activates phospholipase C (1Wank S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G607-G613PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jensen R.T. Wank S.A. Rowley W.H. Sato S. Gardner J.D. Trends Pharmacol.

We report here that CCK stimulates death signaling pathways in rat pancreatic acinar cells, including caspase activation, cytochromec release, and mitochondrial depolarization, leading to apoptosis. The mitochondrial dysfunction is mediated by upstream caspase(s). CCK causes mitochondrial alterations through both PTP-dependent and PTP-independent mechanisms. In addition to apoptosis, caspases also regulate other processes in the pancreatic acinar cell that play key roles in pancreatitis; in particular, caspases negatively regulate necrosis and intra-acinar cell activation of trypsin. Caspase-mediated protection against necrosis and trypsin activation can explain the inverse correlation between the extent of apoptosis on the one hand and necrosis and the severity of the disease on the other hand observed in experimental models of pancreatitis. These signaling mechanisms may play an important role in acinar cell injury and death in pancreatitis. Dispersed rat pancreatic acini were prepared using a previously published collagenase digestion method (12Gukovskaya A.S. Gukovsky I. Zaninovic V. Song M. Sandoval D. Gukovsky S. Pandol S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 13Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. Blinman T.A. Zaninovic V. Pandol S.J. Am. J.

Isolated acini were washed and resuspended in 199 medium supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The cells were plated at a concentration of 5 × 105/ml in 25-ml tissue-culture flasks and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. DNA extraction and gel electrophoresis were performed as we described previously (12Gukovskaya A.S. Gukovsky I. Zaninovic V. Song M. Sandoval D. Gukovsky S. Pandol S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated pancreatic acini were collected by centrifugation, lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 300 μg/ml proteinase K, and 1% (w/v) SDS, and incubated at 48 °C until the mixture became clear. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction (1:1, v/v), precipitated overnight with 0.3 m sodium acetate at −20 °C, and collected by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and treated with RNase (200 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with proteinase K (200 μg/ml) at 48 °C. Finally, the mixture was re-extracted with phenol/chloroform and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in TE buffer. The DNA fragments were electrophoretically separated on 1.8% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide in 0.5× TBE buffer (1- TBE: 89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). Quantification of DNA fragmentation was performed as we described before (12Gukovskaya A.S. Gukovsky I. Zaninovic V. Song M. Sandoval D. Gukovsky S. Pandol S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated pancreatic acini were collected by centrifugation and suspended in TE lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, and 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100. High and low molecular weight DNA molecules were separated by centrifuging the samples for 15 min at 13,000 × g. Supernatants containing fragmented DNA and pellets containing high molecular weight DNA were each incubated overnight at 4 °C in 1 ml of TE lysis buffer and 0.25 ml of 50% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. DNA in precipitates from both supernatants and pellets was hydrolyzed by heating at 70 °C for 20–25 min in 1 ml of 0.5 m HClO4and quantified by the diphenylamine method of Burton (32Burton K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10844) Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, plated on polylysine-coated glass coverslips, fixed for 10 min with methanol at −20 °C, and stained with 8 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 as we described previously (12Gukovskaya A.S.

The slides were examined by fluorescence microscopy. The cells with nuclei containing condensed and/or fragmented chromatin were considered apoptotic. Acinar cell necrosis was determined by the release of LDH into incubation medium (12Gukovskaya A.S. Gukovsky I. Zaninovic V. Song M. Sandoval D. Gukovsky S. Pandol S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). LDH activity was measured spectrofluorimetrically as the production of NAD from pyruvic acid and NADH. The values for LDH release are presented as the percentages of total cellular LDH determined by permeabilizing cells with Triton X-100. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked by 1 h of incubation of the membranes in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5). The blots were then incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies in antibody buffer containing 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TTBS (0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline), washed three times with TTBS, and finally incubated for 1 h with a peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody in the antibody buffer. The blots were developed for visualization using enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). The band intensities in the immunoblots were quantified by densitometry using Scion Image software (Scion Corporation). The acini were collected, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in lysis buffer containing150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm EDTA. The cell lysates were placed for 30 min on a rotator at 4 °C and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatants were collected. The proteolytic reactions were carried out at 37 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 800 μg of cytosolic protein, and 20 μm specific fluorogenic substrate. For caspase-3, the substrate was Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC (AnaSpec); for caspase-8, the substrate was Ac-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-AMC (AnaSpec). Cleavage of the caspase substrate relieves AMC, which emits a fluorescent signal with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 440 nm. The fluorescence was calibrated using a standard curve for AMC. The data are expressed as mol AMC/mg protein/min. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were obtained as described previously (33Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17484-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) and resuspended in an extraction buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, and aprotinin). The cells were incubated for 30 min on ice and then lysed in a glass Dounce homogenizer (80 strokes with B pestle). The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and both the pellet (mitochondrial fraction) and supernatant (cytosolic fraction) were collected separately and used for Western blotting. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was determined as described previously (34Pastorino J.G. Chen S.-T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) by measuring the retention of the dye 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine (DiOC6) (3Williams J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) (Molecular Probes). The cells were loaded with 1 μm DiOC6 (3Williams J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) during the last 30 min of treatment. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The pellet was then lysed by the addition of 1 ml of H2O. The amount of DiOC6(3) retained by cells was determined using a Shimadzu RF-1501 spectrofluorimeter with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 500 nm. The amount of DiOC6(3) retained by cells pretreated for 30 min with 10 μm CCCP (a protonophore) was considered to correspond to a ΔΨm value of 0. Trypsin activity was measured in cell homogenates by a fluorimetric assay as described previously (13Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. Blinman T.A. Zaninovic V. Pandol S.J. Am. J.

Briefly, pancreatic acini were homogenized using a glass Teflon homogenizer in an ice-cold buffer containing 5 mm MES (pH 6.5), 1 mm MgSO4, and 250 mmsucrose. The homogenates were mixed in an assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with a specific substrate, Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC (Peptide International), which is converted by trypsin to a fluorescent product. The product emits fluorescence at 440 nm with excitation at 380 nm. Trypsin was determined using a standard curve for purified trypsin (Worthington) [Ca2+] i was monitored by changes in fluorescence intensity of cells loaded with Fura-2, as we described previously (36Gukovskaya A.S. Pandol S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G350-G356PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the acinar cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 3 μm Fura-2AM in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm ascorbic acid, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor. The cells were then washed twice by centrifugation and resuspended in the same buffer. [Ca2+] i was measured at 37 °C by monitoring Fura-2 fluorescence in Shimadzu RF-1501 spectrofluorimeter with excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission at 510 nm. Amylase secretion was measured spectrophotometrically using Phadeba amylase kit from Pharmacia Diagnostics as described previously (37Pandol S.J. Rodriguez G. Muallem S. Mendius K.E. Cell Calcium. 1989; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The values for amylase secretion are expressed as ratios between the amount of amylase released into the extracellular medium and the total cellular amylase determined by permeabilizing cells with 0.1% SDS in 10 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.8). Statistical analysis of the data was done using unpaired Student's t test. The values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Antibodies against caspases-3, -8, and -9 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; those against cytochromec were from Pharmingen. CCK-8 was from Peninsula Laboratories. Caspase inhibitors zVAD-fmk and zIETD-fmk were from Enzyme Systems Products and Calbiochem, respectively; aristolochic acid and cyclosporin A were from Biomol Research Laboratories; Fura-2AM was from Molecular Probes; and Bio-Rad protein assay was from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Other reagents were from Sigma. Western blot analysis showed that CCK-8 induced activation of both the effector caspase-3 and initiator caspases-8 and -9 in isolated rat pancreatic acinar cells (Fig.1). Caspase-3 activation is recognized by loss of its 32-kDa pro-form and accumulation of the 17-kDa active form (38Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 processing increased with CCK-8 concentration from 0.1 to 100 nm (Fig. 1 A). Processing of caspase-3 was also detected in untreated pancreatic acinar cells and increased with incubation time (Fig. 1 B). Of note, no active caspases were detected in normal pancreatic tissue (not shown). At all times studied, CCK-8 further stimulated cleavage of procaspase-3, its effect being already manifested after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 1 B). Western blot analysis for caspase-8 in pancreatic acinar cells detected a doublet at ∼50 and 54 kDa (Fig. 1 B) possibly corresponding to caspases-8a and -8b (39Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Stimulation with CCK-8 decreased the intensities of both p54 and p50 bands at all times studied, compared with untreated cells. The changes in the p54 isoform were usually more pronounced than in p50 (Fig. 1 B). CCK-induced cleavage of p54 and p50 was associated with the accumulation of a ∼45-kDa product. In untreated cells, processing of caspase-8 was recognized by a time-dependent decrease of the 54-kDa isoform with concomitant increase in the p45 product (Fig.1 B). Activation of caspase-9 in pancreatic acinar cells (Fig. 1 B) was detected as processing of its ∼48-kDa pro-form (39Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2001474154,"Abstract The x-ray structure of ferric unliganded lipid-free Escherichia coli flavohemoglobin has been solved to a resolution of 2.2 A and refined to anR-factor of 19%. The overall fold is similar to that of ferrous lipid-bound Alcaligenes eutrophusflavohemoglobin with the notable exception of the E helix positioning within the globin domain and a rotation of the NAD binding module with respect to the FAD-binding domain accompanied by a substantial rearrangement of the C-terminal region. An inspection of the heme environment in E. coli flavohemoglobin reveals an unexpected architecture of the distal pocket. In fact, the distal site is occupied by the isopropyl side chain Leu-E11 that shields the heme iron from the residues in the topological positions predicted to interact with heme iron-bound ligands, namely Tyr-B10 and Gln-E7, and stabilizes a pentacoordinate ferric iron species. Ligand binding properties are consistent with the presence of a pentacoordinate species in solution as indicated by a very fast second order combination rates with imidazole and azide. Surprisingly, imidazole, cyanide, and azide binding profiles at equilibrium are not accounted for by a single site titration curve but are biphasic and strongly suggest the presence of two distinct conformers within the liganded species."

The cytoskeletal reorganizations are regulated by transient activation and inactivation of Rho GTPases. Previously, we identified μ-calpain as an enzyme that is activated by signaling across β1 and β3 integrins. We showed that it mediates cytoskeletal reorganizations in bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and does so by acting upstream of Rac1 activation. Here we show that μ-calpain is also involved in inactivating RhoA during integrin-induced signaling. Cleavage of RhoA was detectable in BAE cells plated on an integrin substrate; it did not occur in cells plated on poly-l-lysine. Cleavage was inhibited by calpain inhibitors. In vitro, μ-calpain cleaved RhoA generating a fragment of the same size as in intact cells. The cleavage site was identified, an HA-tagged construct expressing calpain-cleaved RhoA generated, and the construct expressed in BAE and CHO cells. Calpain-cleaved RhoA inhibited integrin-induced stress fiber assembly and decreased cell spreading.

Activation of cdc42 leads to filopodia formation; activation of Rac1 induces the formation of submembranous networks of actin filaments required for lamellipodia extension and motility; activation of RhoA leads to the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions that are involved in contractility and in maintaining a spread, adhesive phenotype (9Ridley A.J.

The coordinate regulation of these cellular responses is presumed to be brought about by selective activation of one GTPase over the other (11Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van Kammen R.A.

For example, growth factors that activate cdc42 and Rac1 typically promote cell migration and at the same time inhibit RhoA-induced contractility and stress fiber formation (1Nobes C.D. Hawkins P.

Signals transmitted across integrins as they bind to their ligands cause the integrins to cluster and assemble complexes of signaling molecules that lead to Rac1 activation and the extension of lamellipodia. During this early stage of integrin-induced cell spreading, the activity of RhoA is down-regulated (5Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 6Ren X. Kiosses W. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). At a later time point during integrin-induced spreading, the activity of RhoA is increased, and focal adhesions and contractile actin-myosin stress fibers are formed (6Ren X. Kiosses W. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). The inverse relationship between activation of Rac1 and RhoA suggests the presence of mechanisms by which Rho GTPases are rapidly activated and probably equally rapidly inactivated in a dynamic and highly regulated manner during transmembrane receptor signaling. Although there is now considerable information available concerning the mechanisms involved in activation of Rho family members, little is known about the mechanisms involved in the dynamic inhibition of these proteins. We have been interested in signaling mechanisms involved in activating Rac1 and inactivating RhoA at the early times after integrin-induced spreading. Several years ago, we identified μ-calpain as one of the signaling molecules that was activated following signaling across β3-containing integrins in platelets (13Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Calpains are ubiquitous, intracellular proteases that are active at physiological pH (14Murachi T. Biochem. Int. 1989; 18: 263-294PubMed Google Scholar). They are heterodimers containing a common regulatory subunit of 30 kDa and an 80-kDa catalytic subunit (15Sakihama T. Kakidani H. Zenita K. Yumoto N. Kikuchi T. Sasaki T. Kannagi R. Nakanishi S.

The two primary catalytic subunits are the one present in m-calpain, which requires millimolar levels of calcium for half-maximal activation in vitro, and the one present in μ-calpain, which requires micromolar levels of calcium (18Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). More recently, we showed that μ-calpain was also activated following signaling across β1- and β3-containing integrins in cultured cells. We have shown that calpain is required for the formation of a specific type of integrin cluster that forms early after signaling and prior to detectable cell spreading (19Bialkowska K. Kulkarni S., Du, X. Goll D.E. Saido T.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These integrin clusters form upstream of Rac1 activation and appear to be the site of Rac activation (19Bialkowska K. Kulkarni S., Du, X. Goll D.E. Saido T.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) suggests that signaling molecules in these clusters may be involved in the activation and inactivation of Rho family members at these early stages of spreading. Because μ-calpain is present in these clusters in an active form (19Bialkowska K. Kulkarni S., Du, X. Goll D.E. Saido T.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and several of the proteins in the clusters are cleaved by this protease (20Bialkowska K. Kulkarni S. Fox J.E.B. Blood. 2000; 96 (abstr.): 241aGoogle Scholar, 21Reddy K.B. Bialkowska K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28300-28308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we have considered the possibility that calpain may be involved in regulating the activity of Rho family members. In the present study, we could not detect cleavage of Rac1 or cdc42. However, we found that RhoA is cleaved in cultured cells spreading on an integrin substrate. Cleavage was more pronounced under conditions in which Rac1 activation predominates and was not detected under conditions that favored RhoA activation. Cleavage was induced by calpain, as shown by the fact that 1) both calpain activation and RhoA cleavage were absolutely dependent on integrin engagement; 2) generation of RhoA cleavage product was inhibited by known calpain inhibitors but not by a caspase inhibitor or proteasome inhibitor; and 3) RhoA was cleaved by μ-calpain in vitro, generating fragments of the same size as those generated in intact cells. Further, we identified the site at which μ-calpain cleaves RhoA, expressed calpain-cleaved RhoA in bovine aortic endothelial (BAE)1 cells, and demonstrated that the calpain-cleaved RhoA inhibited the integrin-induced formation of stress fibers and cell spreading. Our previous results show that following integrin signaling calpain activates pathways leading to Rac1 activation (13Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The present results suggest that calpain simultaneously acts directly on RhoA, generating a dominant-negative form of the molecule. They are consistent with a model in which cleavage of RhoA by μ-calpain provides a mechanism for inhibiting RhoA activity and the subsequent formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions under conditions in which a more motile Rac1-induced phenotype is required. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and poly-l-lysine were from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies against the HA-epitope were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The antibodies against RhoA (monoclonal and polyclonal), Rac1 (polyclonal), and cdc42 (polyclonal) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Recombinant Rho GTPases were obtained from two sources. For some experiments His-tagged human RhoA, Rac1, or cdc42 were purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. For other experiments, we expressed human RhoA in Escherichia coli using plasmid pGEX2T encoding RhoA as a GST fusion protein (kindly provided by Dr. Sadashiva Karnik, Cleveland Clinic Foundation). μ-Calpain was purified from bovine skeletal muscle as described previously (22Szpacenko A. Kay J. Goll D.E. Otsuka Y. Turk V. Vitale L.J. Proteinases and Their Inhibitors: Structure, Function, and Applied Aspects. Pergamon Press, Oxford1981: 151Google Scholar, 23Goll D.E. Shannon J.D.

V., Amsterdam1983: 19Google Scholar), and μ-calpain from human erythrocytes was purchased from Calbiochem. The membrane-permeable inhibitor of calpain, calpeptin (Z-Leu-Nle-H), was from Novabiochem, human recombinant calpastatin was fromCalbiochem, and calpain inhibitor I was from Roche. Proteasome inhibitor II and caspase inhibitor I were from Calbiochem. Bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells (provided by Dr. Paul Dicorleto, Cleveland Clinic Foundation) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Hams F-12 medium (1:1, BioWhittaker) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and glutamine (Invitrogen) and were used between passage 8 and 15. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (ATCC) were maintained in Hams F-12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin and glutamine. Jurkat cells (ATCC) were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and glutamine. Recombinant GTPases were incubated with purified μ-calpain at room temperature in Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.5), KCl (100 mm), EDTA (1 mm), and dithiothreitol (5 mm). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 mm CaCl2. At the indicated times, reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed on Western blots. In the experiment in which we determined the site of calpain cleavage, RhoA was expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein, purified on GST-agarose beads, and digested with μ-calpain in a 5-min reaction. Products were electrophoresed through a polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and intact RhoA and the two calpain-induced fragments were excised as three individual bands. The N-terminal sequence of each band was determined in the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Protein Core Facility using previously described methods (24Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar, 25Hunkapiller M.W. Hewick R.M. Dreyer W.J. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 399Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). To minimize the contribution from the effects of growth factors, cells were withdrawn from serum-containing media 24 h prior to experiments. Cells were plated on fibronectin-coated dishes (35 100 mm, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) in the presence or absence of reagents for the indicated time. Cells were solubilized in cold radioimmune precipitation buffer containing Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (20 mm), NaCl (150 mm), sodium deoxycholate (0.1%), Triton X-100 (1%), SDS (O.1%), and the inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), EDTA (2 mm), sodium fluoride (50 mm), and Na3VO4 (1 mm). Total protein was estimated using bovine serum albumin as the standard protein in a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad microassay kit). In other experiments cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding HA-tagged proteins and allowed to recover for 24 h prior to extract preparation. Proteins were denatured by the addition of SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed through SDS gels containing 3.5% polyacrylamide in a stacking gel and 12.5% polyacrylamide in a resolving gel. Western blotting was performed by the method of Towbin et al. (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). The plasmid expressing the calpain-cleaved fragment of RhoA was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using plasmid pGEX2T encoding wild-type human RhoA as a template. The forward primer was 5′-TATTTAAGCTTATGTATGATGTTCCTGATTATGCAAGTTTAGCTGCCATCCGGAAG-3′ encoding an HA epitope (YDVPDYASL) from hemagglutinin virus, and the reverse primer was 5′-TTTATGGATCCTCATTGCAGAGCAGCTCT-3′. The resulting PCR product encoding HA-tagged RhoA truncated at the calpain cleavage site (lacking the last 39 nucleotides corresponding to 13 amino acids) was subcloned into pcDNA3 for expression into cultured cells. The primers were also used with Val-14 RhoA and T19N RhoA (both plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. M. A. Schwartz, The Scripps Research Institute) to generate expression vectors for the HA-tagged constitutively active RhoA truncated at the calpain cleavage site or HA-tagged dominant-negative RhoA truncated at the calpain cleavage site. The sequences were verified by nucleotide sequencing for all plasmids. Transient transfections with the plasmids encoding HA-tagged RhoA mutants truncated at the calpain cleavage site, wild-type RhoA (provided by Dr. M. A. Schwartz), the active Val-14 RhoA, or the inactive T19N RhoA were carried out in BAE or CHO cells. Cells were cultured in 35–60-mm dishes and transfected with 4 μg of DNA using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) as described earlier. Transfected cells were allowed to recover for 24 h, trypsinized, and plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips. After 2 h, the cells were fixed with 1.4% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with 4% horse serum. Cells were incubated with anti-HA antibody (0.5 μg/ml) to detect transfected cells and TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma, 0.5 μg/ml) to detect actin filaments. Images were collected using a Zeiss immunofluorescence microscope or Leica confocal microscope. Previously, we have shown that calpain is activated as a consequence of integrin-induced signaling in spreading cells. Thus, as a first step in determining whether Rho proteins were cleaved by calpain following integrin-ligand interactions, we determined whether cleaved forms of Rho proteins were generated as a consequence of integrin-induced signaling. Using Western blot analysis, we were unable to detect cleaved forms of Rac1 or cdc42 in BAE cells spreading on an integrin substrate (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 1, a 20-kDa fragment that was not detectable in cells in suspension (lane 1) was present in cells spreading on the β1-integrin substrate, fibronectin (lane 2). It was not detectable in cells spreading on poly-l-lysine (which is not an integrin ligand) (lane 3). A 20-kDa RhoA fragment was also generated in Jurkat cells spreading on an integrin substrate under conditions known to induce activation of calpain (data not shown). To investigate the possibility that the RhoA fragment was generated by calpain, the calpain inhibitors calpeptin and calpain inhibitor I were included in the incubations prior to plating the BAE cells on an integrin substrate. As shown in Fig.2 A, the integrin-induced generation of the RhoA fragment (lane 2 compared withlane 1) was inhibited in the presence of calpeptin (lane 3 compared with lane 2) or calpain inhibitor 1 (lane 4 compared with lane 2). The proteasome inhibitor II (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) or caspase inhibitor I (Fig. 2 B, lane 3) had no effect on the integrin-induced generation of the RhoA fragment. The finding that the RhoA fragment was generated under conditions in which μ-calpain is known to be activated and was inhibited under conditions known to inhibit calpain suggested that it might be generated as a consequence of cleavage by calpain. To determine whether Rho family members were substrates of calpain, recombinant human His-tagged cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA were incubated with μ-calpain purified from human erythrocytes (Fig.3). Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and samples were electrophoresed through SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Rac1 was detected with polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 3 A), cdc42 was detected with polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 3 B), and RhoA was detected with the same monoclonal antibody that was used in Figs. 1 and2 (Fig. 3 C). Cleavage of Rac1 or cdc42 by μ-calpain was not detected. However, μ-calpain cleaved RhoA, generating a fragment of a molecular mass of 20 kDa that co-migrated with the 20-kDa fragment detected in cultured cells. To determine whether we could detect additional RhoA fragments generated by calpain, the Western blots of calpain-cleaved RhoA were probed with polyclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3 D (lane 2), the polyclonal antibodies detected the 20-kDa fragment identified with the monoclonal antibody in intact cells (Figs. 1 and 2) and in vitroincubations (Fig. 3 C), but it also detected a 14-kDa fragment. As in cultured cells spreading on an integrin substrate (Fig.2 A), calpeptin and calpastatin inhibited the μ-calpain-induced cleavage of recombinant Rho A (Fig. 3 D,lanes 3 and 4). Similar results were obtained with RhoA that was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli, purified, and incubated with either μ-calpain from human erythrocytes or with μ-calpain purified from bovine skeletal muscle (data not shown). To gain insight into the functional consequence of RhoA cleavage, we identified the site of cleavage in recombinant RhoA and transfected cells with cDNA encoding RhoA that was terminated at this site. First, to identify the site of cleavage, recombinant RhoA was expressed in E. coli, purified, and incubated with purified μ-calpain for 5 min. The reaction products were separated on a polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The band corresponding to intact RhoA and the fragments of 20 and 14 kDa were excised and subjected to protein microsequencing. The N-terminal sequence of all three bands was determined. The intact RhoA protein and the 20-kDa fragment had the same N-terminal amino acids. The fragment that migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa contained the last 13 amino acid residues of RhoA. Thus, μ-calpain cleaved RhoA between Gln-180 and Ala-181 (Fig. 4), generating RhoA lacking the C-terminal 13 amino acids and a fragment containing only the last 13 amino acids. The reason why a peptide containing only 13 amino acids migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa is not known, but it suggests some form of oligomerization that persists in SDS gels and is consistent with the known presence of structural determinants for dimerization in the C-terminal polybasic region of Rho GTPases (27Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine the consequence of the calpain-induced cleavage of RhoA, we generated a plasmid encoding HA-tagged RhoA truncated at the μ-calpain cleavage site (Ala-181) and transfected it into CHO cells. Cells were transfected with HA-tagged truncated RhoA or HA-tagged full-length RhoA, and extracts were analyzed on Western blots. Fig.5 (left panel) shows that the truncated protein was expressed and that it migrated at an appropriate position on the gels, below the HA-tagged full-length protein. Theright panel of Fig. 5 shows the blot stripped of HA antibody and reprobed with RhoA antibodies to detect endogenous RhoA, providing an indication of the relative amounts of expression of endogenous and HA-tagged RhoA proteins. To investigate the functional significance of calpain-induced cleavage of RhoA, BAE cells were transfected with the HA-tagged truncated RhoA, trypsinized, and plated on fibronectin for 2 h (Fig.6). The cells expressing the truncated RhoA were identified by staining with anti-HA antibody, and the organization of the cytoskeleton was analyzed by staining stress fibers with TRITC-phalloidin. Cells that did not express the truncated RhoA construct spread and contained numerous stress fibers, whereas the cells that expressed truncated RhoA contained few stress fibers and showed decreased spreading (Fig. 6). To ensure that the inhibitory effects of the truncated Rho construct was not a nonspecific transfection effect, cells were also transfected with HA-tagged wild-type RhoA or HA-tagged constitutively active RhoA. Cells expressing these constructs spread on fibronectin and formed stress fibers (Fig. 7). In contrast, cells expressing HA-tagged inactive RhoA (T19N RhoA) showed inhibition of spreading and stress fiber assembly comparable with that observed with the construct encoding calpain-cleaved RhoA (Fig. 7, bottom panels). Similar results were obtained when CHO cells were transfected with the RhoA constructs. Thus, the construct encoding calpain-cleaved RhoA inhibited cell spreading and stress fiber formation (Fig.8); HA-tagged full-length or constitutively active RhoA had no inhibitory effects on cell spreading or stress fiber formation (Fig. 9); and HA-tagged inactive RhoA inhibited spreading and stress fiber formation (Fig. 9, bottom panels). Examination of a total of 110 transfected CHO cells and 85 transfected BAE cells revealed that 68% of the CHO cells and 88% of the BAE cells expressing the calpain-truncated RhoA showed inhibition of spreading compared with control cells.Figure 9Immunofluorescence images showing that CHO cells expressing HA-tagged wild-type or constitutively active RhoA form stress fibers and spread normally, whereas cells expressing HA-tagged dominant-negative RhoA show decreased stress fiber formation and spreading. CHO cells were transfected with HA-tagged wild-type RhoA, constitutively active Val-14 RhoA, or dominant-negative T19N RhoA. Cells were plated on fibronectin for 2 h. Transfected cells were detected with anti-HA antibody, and actin filaments were detected with TRITC-phalloidin. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The experiments presented so far indicate that cleavage of RhoA by calpain can create a dominant-negative form of the protein. However, they do not show whether calpain cleavage of RhoA that was already active would prevent the functional activity of the protein. To gain insight into this question, cells were transfected with HA-tagged constitutively active RhoA (Val-14 RhoA) that was truncated at the calpain cleavage site of wild-type RhoA. As shown in Fig. 10, BAE cells (upper panels) or CHO cells (lower panels) expressing truncated plasmid showed little spreading or stress fiber formation. The inhibitory effects of truncated constitutively active RhoA were comparable with those observed when a constitutively inactive form of RhoA (T19N RhoA) that was truncated at the calpain-cleavage site was expressed (data not shown). Rac1 and RhoA induce very different phenotypes in cells cultured on integrin substrates. Rac1 activation leads to the formation of lamellipodia and submembranous actin filaments that favor migration, whereas RhoA induces the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions that are thought to be important in more fully spread and stationary cells. Evidence has been provided that RhoA is down-regulated in cells exhibiting a Rac1 phenotype (5Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 6Ren X. Kiosses W. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 28Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The observation that calpain-cleaved RhoA inhibits cell spreading suggested that calpain cleavage might provide a mechanism for inhibiting RhoA activity. We reasoned that if this was the case, the amounts of cleaved RhoA might be high in cultured cells exhibiting a Rac1 phenotype and low in those exhibiting a RhoA phenotype. One way in which the relative activation of Rac1 and RhoA can be modulated in cells spreading on an integrin substrate is by inclusion of soluble agonists in the medium. In the absence of other agonists, cells rely absolutely on signals transmitted across ligand-occupied integrin to induce activation of Rac1 or RhoA. However, if PDGF is included in the medium, Rac1 can also be activated as a consequence of signaling across the PDGF receptor (10Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar, 11Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, cells rapidly extend lamellipodia, become filled with Rac1-induced focal complexes (detected with phosphotyrosine antibodies in Fig. 11 A), and show a motile phenotype (Fig. 11 A, upper panels). In contrast, if LPA is included in the medium, RhoA is activated through G protein-coupled receptors (29Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 30Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and the cells become filled with focal adhesions (detected with phosphotyrosine antibodies in Fig. 11 A) and stress fibers and show a much more stationary, spread phenotype (Fig. 11 A, lower panels). To determine whether generation of the RhoA fragment was increased when Rac1 activation was increased and decreased when RhoA activation was increased, cells grown on an integrin substrate in the presence or absence of PDGF or LPA were solubilized and analyzed on Western blots. The polyclonal antibodies were used to detect calpain-induced cleavage. As shown in Fig. 11 B, the integrin-induced generation of the two RhoA fragments was increased in cells exposed to PDGF (Fig.11 B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Generation of the RhoA fragment was dependent on integrin signaling because the fragment was not present in cells spread on poly-l-lysine (lane 3). Because calpain is activated following integrin-ligand engagement but is not activated in cells spreading on poly-l-lysine, this observation is consistent with the fragment being generated as a consequence of integrin-induced activation of calpain. In contrast to cells spreading in the presence of PDGF, those spreading in the presence of LPA, which activates RhoA, did not show the presence of the RhoA fragment (Fig.11 B, lane 4). These results indicate that the generation of the RhoA fragment occurs under conditions favoring Rac1 activation and is down-regulated under conditions favoring RhoA activation, suggesting that generation of the RhoA fragment might provide a mechanism of inhibiting RhoA function. Rho GTPases are involved in the regulation of dynamic cytoskeletal reorganizations that occur following signaling across a variety of transmembrane receptors. Cdc42 is involved in inducing the formation of filopodia (31Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), Rac1 in the formation of the networks of submembranous actin filaments (10Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar) that are characteristic of a motile cell, and RhoA in the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions that stabilize adhesion in a more fully spread, stationary cell (6Ren X. Kiosses W. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 9Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3808) Google Scholar). Because of the different functions of the Rho GTPases, mechanisms must presumably exist for the selective activation or inactivation of the proteins so that only Rho GTPases involved in inducing the required cytoskeletal reorganization are active under any given situation. Although there is considerable information concerning mechanisms involved in activation of Rho proteins (7Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5199) Google Scholar, 29Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), little is known about mechanisms involved in their inhibition. One situation in which differential functional activity of Rho GTPases has been reported is in cultured cells spreading on an integrin substrate. Previously, we have identified the calcium-dependent protease, μ-calpain, as being one of the signaling molecules activated during signaling across integrins (13Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Bialkowska K. Kulkarni S., Du, X. Goll D.E. Saido T.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that calpain cleaves RhoA in spreading cells and is involved in inhibiting the activities of RhoA under conditions favoring Rac1 activation. Several lines of evidence indicate that RhoA is cleaved by calpain in spreading cells. First, purified μ-calpain cleaved recombinant RhoA, generating two fragments. Second, two RhoA fragments of comparable molecular weight were generated in cultured cells spreading on an integrin substrate. Third, the RhoA fragments were generated in cells spreading on an integrin substrate (which leads to activation of μ-calpain) but not in cells spreading on poly-l-lysine (which does not lead to activation of calpain). Fourth, the integrin-induced generation of RhoA fragments in cultured cells was selectively inhibited by calpain inhibitors. Taken together, these findings suggest that the RhoA fragments result from the direct action of calpain on RhoA and that the integrin-induced activation of μ-calpain provides a mechanism for regulating Rho GTPases in spreading cells. When active, RhoA interacts with effectors that mediate the formation of actin filament bundles known as stress fibers (2Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar, 32Machesky L.M. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). To determine whether the calpain-induced cleavage of RhoA regulates its activity, calpain-truncated RhoA (Ala-181→ stop) was expressed in cultured cells. Expression of calpain-truncated RhoA markedly inhibited cell spreading and cells expressing the truncated form assembled few stress fibers. This finding suggests that calpain cleaves RhoA into a form that does not induce its normal downstream events. The almost total inhibition of stress fiber formation suggests that cleaved RhoA can act as a dominant-negative molecule. The finding that cells expressing the truncated form of RhoA had a very similar phenotype to those expressing a known dominant-negative form of RhoA is consistent with this interpretation. Moreover, integrin-induced cleavage of RhoA was enhanced under conditions of Rac1 activation in spreading cells and was low under conditions of RhoA activation. These data are consistent with the notion that calpain cleaves RhoA during integrin-induced spreading, generating a dominant-negative form of the molecule that inhibits the function of RhoA in spreading cells. The spreading of cells on an integrin substrate is a very dynamic process with integrin complexes and actin filament organizations changing rapidly as cells extend at the leading edge and retract at the trailing edge (33Ballestrem C. Hinz H.B. Imhof B.A. Wehrle-Haller B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Presumably complex mechanisms must exist to coordinate the rapid switches between the Rho GTPase at specific stages of spreading and sites within the cell. One situation in which differential activation of Rac1 and RhoA has been shown to occur is at the early stages of integrin-induced spreading. At this stage of spreading, Rac1 activity is required for the formation of lamellipodia, and mechanisms appear to exist for maintaining RhoA in an inactive form until the cells have spread to a point where RhoA-induced stress fibers and focal adhesions are required (5Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 6Ren X. Kiosses W. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 28Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that one of the earliest detectable events following integrin-induced adhesion is the formation of a previously unrecognized type of integrin cluster; these clusters contain active calpain, calpain-cleaved integrin, and cytoskeletal proteins and signaling molecules not detected in the previously described focal complexes and adhesions (20Bialkowska K. Kulkarni S. Fox J.E.B. Blood. 2000; 96 (abstr.): 241aGoogle Scholar,21Reddy K.B. Bialkowska K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28300-28308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The clusters form upstream of Rac1 activation, and we have suggested that they allow Rac1 activation because they bring together proteins involved in integrin-induced Rac1 activation (20Bialkowska K. Kulkarni S. Fox J.E.B. Blood. 2000; 96 (abstr.): 241aGoogle Scholar, 21Reddy K.B. Bialkowska K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28300-28308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Perhaps the presence of μ-calpain in these clusters provides the mechanism by which RhoA is inhibited at the early stages of integrin-induced spreading. Another situation in which RhoA activity presumably needs to be regulated is in the breakdown of focal adhesions and stress fibers at the trailing edge of migrating cells. In this situation, the functional activity of previously activated RhoA would presumably be prevented. The finding in the present study that calpain prevents the functional activity of constitutively active Val-14 RhoA suggests that calpain might serve not only to prevent RhoA from becoming functionally active but also to prevent RhoA that has already been activated from exerting its effects. Sequencing of the RhoA cleavage products in this study revealed that the μ-calpain-induced cleavage of RhoA results in a truncated protein that contains most of the molecule; only 13 amino acids are removed. It is of interest to speculate about the mechanisms by which the calpain-induced removal of 13 amino acids could inhibit RhoA functions within cells. Rho GTPases are activated by exchange factors that interact with them, accelerating the GDP/GTP exchange. The GTP-bound form of the Rho proteins can bind downstream effector molecules such as protein or lipid kinases and in this way initiate downstream cascades leading to specific cytoskeletal reorganizations (7Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5199) Google Scholar, 29Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol.

The finding that expression of RhoA truncated at the calpain cleavage site results in inhibition of stress fiber formation suggests that the cleaved molecule acts as a dominant-negative protein. Thus, the cleaved form presumably retains sites that interact with critical effectors or regulators. One possibility is that the cleaved form can no longer bind exchange factors. However, the finding that truncated, constitutively active RhoA acts as a dominant-negative molecule suggests that calpain can prevent the RhoA from exerting its effects on the cytoskeleton even after it has been activated. Similarly, the RhoA molecule remaining after removal of 13 amino acids contains the N-terminal domain that binds GDP/GTP and is responsible for GTPase activity. Thus, it would be expected to retain its ability to hydrolyze GTP. The 13 C-terminal amino acids that are removed contain a CLVL motif (34Willumsen B.M. Norris K. Papageorge A.G. Hubert N.L. Lowry D.

Therefore, it is conceivable that calpain cleaved RhoA cannot associate with the submembranous sites at which RhoA normally acts. Thus, removal of the C-terminal 13 amino acids might provide a mechanism for ensuring that even if RhoA has been activated it would be unable to exert its functional activities once it is cleaved by calpain. In such a model, cleavage of RhoA at sites at which calpain is localized might provide a mechanism for preventing RhoA from inducing cytoskeletal reorganizations at those sites. It might also provide a mechanism for arresting the functional activities at sites at which RhoA-induced cytoskeletal organization is no longer required. Future studies will be required to investigate these possibilities."
https://openalex.org/W2081485603,"In current views, translation-coupled ribosome binding to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is transient, with association occurring via the signal recognition particle pathway and dissociation occurring upon the termination of protein synthesis. Recent studies indicate, however, that ribosomal subunits remain membrane-bound following the termination of protein synthesis. To define the mechanism of post-termination ribosome association with the ER membrane, membrane-bound ribosomes were detergent-solubilized from tissue culture cells at different stages of the protein synthesis cycle, and the composition of the ribosome-associated membrane protein fraction was determined. We report that ribosomes reside in stable association with the Sec61alpha-translocon following the termination stage of protein synthesis. Additionally, in vitro experiments revealed that solubilized, gradient-purified ribosome-translocon complexes were able to initiate the translation of secretory and cytosolic proteins and were functional in assays of signal sequence recognition. Using this experimental system, synthesis of signal sequence-bearing polypeptides yielded a tight ribosome-translocon junction; synthesis of nascent polypeptides lacking a signal sequence resulted in a disruption of this junction. On the basis of these data, we propose that in situ, ribosomes reside in association with the translocon throughout the cycle of protein synthesis, with membrane release occurring upon translation of proteins lacking topogenic signals."
https://openalex.org/W2144133200,"We used phage display to generate surrogate peptides that define the hotspots involved in protein-protein interaction between insulin and the insulin receptor. All of the peptides competed for insulin binding and had affinity constants in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range. Based on competition studies, peptides were grouped into non-overlapping Sites 1, 2, or 3. Some Site 1 peptides were able to activate the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor and act as agonists in the insulin-dependent fat cell assay, suggesting that Site 1 marks the hotspot involved in insulin-induced activation of the insulin receptor. On the other hand, Site 2 and 3 peptides were found to act as antagonists in the phosphorylation and fat cell assays. These data show that a peptide display can be used to define the molecular architecture of a receptor and to identify the critical regions required for biological activity in a site-directed manner."

These findings suggest that there are proteins involved in regulation of body weight and reproductive physiology, which require tyrosine sulfation for optimal function that are yet to be described.

TPSTs catalyze the transfer of sulfate from PAPS to the side chain hydroxyl of tyrosine residues within acidic motifs of proteins that transit the Golgi. Mouse and human cDNAs encoding TPST-1 were first isolated by Ouyang et al. (1Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) using the amino acid sequence obtained from a purified rat liver TPST preparation. Subsequently, a second member of the gene family, TPST-2, was identified based on its high degree of homology to TPST-1 (2Ouyang Y.B. Moore K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24770-24774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 3Beisswanger R. Corbeil D. Vannier C. Thiele C. Dohrmann U. Kellner R. Ashman K. Niehrs C.

There is no evidence for the existence of additional mouse or humanTPST genes in the publicly accessible genomic or expressed sequence tag databases. Human and mouse TPST-1 are ≈96% identical, and human and mouse TPST-2 have a similar degree of identity. TPST-1 is ≈65% identical to TPST-2 in both mouse and man (4Moore K.L. Wiley Encyclopedia of Molecular Medicine. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001Google Scholar). Each enzyme is ≈370 amino acids in length with type II transmembrane topology and a lumenally oriented catalytic domain. Experimental evidence shows that TPST-1 has two N-linked sugars and indicates that the lumenal catalytic domain contain one or more disulfide bonds (1Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 2Ouyang Y.B. Moore K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24770-24774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Based on Northern blot analyses of a variety of human and mouse tissues, TPST-1 and TPST-2 transcripts are ubiquitously expressed, although there are some differences in the abundance of TPST transcripts in certain tissues (1Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 2Ouyang Y.B. Moore K.L. J. Biol.

Expressed sequence tags corresponding to both enzymes are represented in many cDNA libraries derived from a variety of normal tissues, including libraries derived from mouse embryos as early as 8 days postcoitum (dpc). We have detected TPST-1 and TPST-2 transcripts in several clonal cell lines including HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia), HeLa S3 (cervical adenocarcinoma), K-562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), MOLT-4 (T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia), SW480 (colon adenocarcinoma), A549 (lung carcinoma), and G361 (melanoma) cells, as well as human umbilical endothelial cells. 2Y.-B. Ouyang and K. L. Moore, unpublished observations. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that both enzymes are co-expressed in many and perhaps in all cell types. An examination of the amino acid residues surrounding known tyrosine sulfation sites in proteins reveals that the major characteristic feature is the presence of several acidic amino acid residues within ±5 residues of the sulfotyrosine. However, there are no invariant residues in the window surrounding known sulfotyrosines. Based on this information coupled with in vitro studies using synthetic peptide acceptors and crude enzyme preparations, consensus features for tyrosine sulfation have been described (PROSITE accession number PS00003, www.expasy.ch/prosite/) (5Huttner W.B. Baeuerle P.A. Mod. Cell Biol. 1988; 6: 97-140Google Scholar, 6Nicholas H.B., Jr. Chan S.S. Rosenquist G.L. Endocrine. 1999; 11: 285-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the positive predictive value of these features is unknown. To date, only a couple dozen tyrosine-sulfated proteins have been described in man, and substantially fewer have been documented in the mouse, but there are certainly many others yet to be described (4Moore K.L. Wiley Encyclopedia of Molecular Medicine. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001Google Scholar, 5Huttner W.B. Baeuerle P.A. Mod. Cell Biol. 1988; 6: 97-140Google Scholar, 7Kehoe J.W. Bertozzi C.R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R57-R61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Among the known tyrosine-sulfated proteins are many that play important roles in inflammation, hemostasis, immunity, and other processes. These include certain adhesion molecules (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, platelet glycoprotein Ibα), G-protein-coupled receptors (CCR5, CCR2B, CXCR4, and C5a receptor), coagulation factors (factors V, VIII, and IX), serpins (α2-antiplasmin and heparin cofactor II), extracellular matrix proteins (vitronectin, fibronectin, laminin, type III collagen, and microfibril-associated glycoprotein-1), hormones (gastrin and cholecystokinin), and others. Tyrosine sulfation has been shown to be required for the optimal function of some proteins. For example, tyrosine sulfation of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 is required for binding to P-selectin (8Wilkins P.P. Moore K.L. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22677-22680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), tyrosine sulfation of coagulation factors V and VIII is required for optimal thrombin-mediated activation (9Pittman D.D. Tomkinson K.N. Michnick D. Selighsohn U. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6952-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Pittman D.D. Wang J.H. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3315-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and sulfation of cholecystokinin (CCK) is required for CCK-A receptor activation (11Steigerwalt R.W. Williams J.A. Endocrinology. 1981; 109: 1746-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, in many of the known tyrosine-sulfated proteins, a functional role for tyrosine sulfation has not been established. Little is known about the macromolecular substrate specificity of these two enzymes and whether their substrate repertoires are distinct or overlapping. However, the very limited data that have been published on this question suggest that the specificity of the two TPSTs toward small peptide acceptors differs (2Ouyang Y.B. Moore K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24770-24774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This information, or lack thereof, makes it impossible to make cogent predictions regarding the phenotype(s) of TPST-deficient mice, although it would seem reasonable to expect that the phenotypic expression of TPST-1 or TPST-2 deficiency may be pleiotropic given the functional importance of tyrosine sulfation in the optimal function of several known and perhaps many unknown tyrosine-sulfated proteins. To gain a better understanding of TPST function in vivo we have developed TPST-1-deficient mice by targeted disruption of theTpst1 gene. Herein we describe the details of our work on the production and initial characterization of these mice. Mouse genomic clones were identified and plaque purified from a 129S6/SvEv spleen Lambda FIX IITM genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by high stringency hybridization with a full-length mouse TPST-1 cDNA probe. The genomic organization of the Tpst1 gene was partially characterized by a combination of Southern blotting, restriction mapping, and sequence analysis. Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences showed that most of the TPST-1 open reading frame including the N-terminal 281 (out of 370) amino acids of the protein was encoded by a single 946-bp exon, which includes 101 bp of 5′-untranslated region and 845 bp of coding sequence. This was designated exon 3 by analogy to the genomic structure of the humanTPST2 gene (2Ouyang Y.B. Moore K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24770-24774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and includes the initiating methionine, all six lumenal cysteine residues, and both N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 1 A). Most importantly this region contains both the 5′-phosphate-sulfate binding (PSB) motif and the 3′-phosphate binding (PB) motif described previously as being involved in binding the 5′- and 3′-sulfate groups of the substrate analog PAP in the four known sulfotransferase crystal structures (12Yoshinari K. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2001; 15: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A construct was engineered for targeted disruption of theTpst1 gene in which a 1.3-kb fragment spanning exon 3 was replaced by a 1.7-kb PGKneo cassette (Fig. 1 B). A 4.5-kbSspI-XbaI genomic fragment was used as the left arm for homologous recombination and was cloned into the pPGKneo vector upstream of the PGKneo cassette. The 1.1-kb right arm 3′ to exon 3 was generated by PCR and cloned downstream of the PGKneo cassette. Sequencing of both strands confirmed that the nucleotide sequence was identical to the genomic template used to generate it. The construct was linearized with NotI and electroporated into AB2.2 embryonic stem cells, an ES cell line derived from male 129S6/SvEv mice (Lexicon Genetics Inc., Houston, TX). After G418 selection, five positive clones were identified from 900 G418-resistant colonies by PCR screening. Surviving clones were further analyzed by Southern blotting to confirm the correct homologous recombination event, and random integration of extra copies of the targeting construct was excluded by hybridization with a neomycin probe (not shown). ES clones were injected into blastocysts, and the blastocysts were implanted into pseudopregnant mice to generate chimeras. Chimeric males were bred with wild-type 129S6/SvEv females (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NJ) to generate Tpst1 +/− mice on a 129S6/SvEv inbred genetic background, and Tpst1 +/− mice were interbred to generate mice with three Tpst1 genotypes (Tpst1 +/+, Tpst1 +/−,Tpst1 −/−). Genotyping was performed by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GGACTGTCTGACCAAGTGGAACCGGGC-3′ and 5′-GTTTGCTCCTGCCTCCCAAGTGCTGGC-3′ for the 348-bp fragment from the wild-type allele, and 5′-CCTCGTGCTTTACGGTATCGCCGC-3′ and 5′-GTTTGCTCCTGCCTCCCAAGTGCTGGC-3′ for the 600-bp fragment from the mutant allele. All experiments reported here were performed on mice in the 129S6/SvEv background. Mice were housed in ventilated racks under 12-h light/12-h dark cycles in a controlled environment with 50% relative humidity at 21 °C. All animals were maintained on sterilized pelleted feed (Harlan Teklad number 7913) containing 6% fat and 18% protein. Breeding cages were inspected daily to determine date of birth. In all breeding experiments mice were pairwise-mated, and pups were weaned at 21 days of age. All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. Total RNA was isolated from tissues using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen), separated on 1% denatured gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. For Northern blotting a 1205-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 212–1416 of the full-length cDNA was used as a probe. For Southern blotting, tail DNA was isolated (Qiagen genomic DNA kit), exhaustively digested with XbaI, and then separated on 1% agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. A 793-bp TPST-1 DNA fragment downstream of the right arm (Probe B) was used as a probe. Filters were prehybridized with Hybrisol solution (Oncor) for 60 min at 42 °C and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes overnight at 42 °C. The blots were washed twice with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 22 °C and twice with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C. The membrane was exposed to a phosphorimaging screen at room temperature. Mice were euthanized, and the livers were rapidly excised and immersed in cold homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mmsucrose, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Homogenates were centrifuged (10 min, 800 × g), and the postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged (30 min, 16,000 × g). The microsomal pellets were suspended in 1.5 ml/g of liver in 2% Triton X-100, 20 mm TAPS (pH 9.0), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin/antipain and stirred for 1 h. Microsomal extracts were then clarified by centrifugation (30 min, 16,000 × g), and to the supernatants glycerol was added to 10% (w/v), MOPS (pH 7.5) to 50 mm, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 0.5 mm. The samples were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. TPST activity was determined by measuring the transfer of [35S]sulfate from [35S]PAPS to an immobilized peptide substrate (QATEYEYLDYDFLPE) modeled on the N-terminal 15 residues of the mature P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 polypeptide as previously described (1Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Chromosomal mapping was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) signal mapping and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stain to assign chromosome number by SeeDNA Biotech Inc. (Windsor, Canada). Lymphocytes were isolated from mouse spleen and cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum and 3 μg/ml concanavalin A, 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide, and 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol. After 44 h the cells were treated with 0.18 mg/ml bromodeoxyuridine for an additional 14 h. Synchronized cells were washed and recultured at 37 °C for 4 h in α-minimal essential medium with 2.5 μg/ml thymidine, and chromosome slides were prepared. A 5-kb mouse genomic DNA fragment spanning exon 3 was used for FISH mapping. The probe was biotinylated with dATP using the Invitrogen BioNick labeling kit (15 °C for 1 h). The procedure for FISH detection was performed according to Heng et al. (13Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and Heng and Tsui (14Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Briefly, slides were baked at 55 °C for 1 h, RNase-treated, denatured (70% formamide in 2 × SSC, 2 min, 70 °C), then dehydrated with ethanol. Probes were denatured (75 °C, 5 min) in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, prehybridized for 15 min at 37 °C, and then hybridized overnight. FISH signals and DAPI banding patterns were captured using a CCD camera, and the assignment of the FISH mapping data with chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposing FISH signals with DAPI-banded chromosomes. To disrupt the Tpst1 gene we constructed a targeting vector in which exon 3 of the Tpst1 gene was replaced with a PGKneo cassette (Fig. 1 B). Linearized targeting vector was used to electroporate ES cells, which were then subjected to positive selection. Homologous recombinants were detected using PCR and confirmed by Southern analysis ofEcoNI-digested genomic DNA using probe A andXbaI-digested DNA using probe B (Fig. 1 B). ES clones were injected into blastocysts, and the blastocysts were implanted into pseudopregnant mice using standard techniques. Male chimeras were mated with wild-type 129S6/SvEv females, and heterozygotes were interbred to generateTpst1 −/− mice. Transmission of the targeted mutation was confirmed by PCR and genomic Southern blot analysis of tail DNA isolated from gene-targeted animals as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Homologous recombination at theTpst1 locus resulted in the introduction of aXbaI site that results in a shorter XbaI genomic fragment (3.8 kb) than that from the wild-type allele (5 kb) that is detected by hybridization with Probe B (Fig. 1 C). Functional inactivation of the Tpst1 gene was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated fromTpst1 +/+, Tpst1 +/−, andTpst1 −/− mouse organs (Fig. 1 D). This analysis showed an ≈50% reduction of full-lengthTpst1 mRNA (≈1.8 kb) in both spleen and testes ofTpst1 +/− mice compared with wild-type and failed to detect full-length transcripts inTpst1 −/− even in testes, which expresses abundant levels of Tpst1 mRNA (1Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A parallel analysis using a Tpst2 cDNA probe demonstrated that disruption of the Tpst1 gene had no detectable effect on expression of theTpst2 gene in these tissues (Fig.1 D). In Tpst1 +/− andTpst1 −/− mice, but not wild-type mice, a smaller mRNA species was detected in testes and was also apparent in the spleen when the blots were overexposed. To assess the structure of this transcript, Northern blots were reprobed with an exon 3-specific probe corresponding to nucleotides 212–740 of the full-length cDNA. As expected, this analysis detected the full-length message in Tpst1 +/+ andTpst1 +/− but not the smaller transcript inTpst1 +/− and Tpst1 −/−samples, thus confirming that this smaller transcript lacked exon 3 (not shown). Given that exon 3 encodes the first 281 of 370 amino acids of the mature protein, including the 5′-PSB motif and the 3′-PB motif that are critical for catalysis, it is certain that this translation of this transcript could not result in a functional protein. To determine the impact of TPST-1 deficiency on the total enzyme activity, assays of liver microsomal extracts were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using a P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 acceptor peptide that is an efficient acceptor for both TPST-1 and TPST-2 (2Ouyang Y.B. Moore K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24770-24774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We found that TPST activity in liver extracts from Tpst1 −/− mice was reduced to ≈12% of that observed in wild-type mice (Fig. 1 E). This suggests that TPST-1 is the predominant TPST in mouse liver. However, a firm conclusion cannot be made based on these data because we lack definitive knowledge regarding whether these enzymes differ with respect to their K m for PAPS and acceptor, and it is well established that PAPS is unstable in crude tissue extracts (15Rens-Domiano S. Roth J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 899-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the 129S6/SvEv background, Tpst1 +/− mice appeared normal. Male and female heterozygote mating pairs yielded litters of normal size (5.8 ± 2.1 (mean ± S.D., n = 57)) when compared with that reported for this strain by the supplier (Taconic Farms, Inc.). Among all offspring fromTpst1 +/− × Tpst1 +/−crosses, the ratio of the three Tpst1 genotypes was consistent with Mendelian inheritance, indicating thatTpst1 −/− mice develop normally in utero and that the sex ratio in each Tpst1 genotype was ≈50:50 (Table I).Table IGenotype and sex distribution among offspring from Tpst1 +/− × Tpst1 +/− crosses Tpst1 genotypeTotalRatio+/++/−−/−Male3477281390.52Female3356381270.48Total6713366266Ratio0.250.500.25Animals were mated, genotyped, and weaned as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Animals were mated, genotyped, and weaned as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To assess the growth of Tpst1 −/− mice, a large cohort of mice were weighed weekly from age 2 to 10 weeks (Fig.2). At 2 and 3 weeks of age, the mean weights of male and female Tpst1 −/− mice were not statistically different from wild-type animals. However, after weaning, the mean body weights of male and femaleTpst1 −/− mice lagged behind that of wild-type animals. Beginning at 5–6 weeks of age, male and femaleTpst1 −/− mice weighed 0.8–1.3 and 0.6–1.0 g less than the wild-type cohort, respectively. Although modest, these differences in weight constitute ≈5% of the body weight and were statistically significant beginning at 4–5 weeks (Fig. 2). The biological significance of this observation is substantially strengthened by the fact that these mice are on an inbred genetic background. The mean body weight of Tpst1 +/−mice was not statistically different from wild-type animals (not shown). Otherwise, Tpst1 −/− mice appeared healthy out to 12 months of age. Hematoxylin/eosin staining of tissues from 15-week-old mice showed no evidence of histological abnormalities in heart, liver, brain, spleen, kidney, lung, stomach, small or large bowel, testes, or ovary (not shown). Early in this study we noticed that litter sizes fromTpst1 −/− females appeared somewhat low. Moreover, in a 1-year period, we observed that the mean size of litters at birth from Tpst1 +/+ ×Tpst1 +/+, Tpst1 +/− ×Tpst1 +/−, and Tpst1 −/−× Tpst1 −/− crosses were 6.2 ± 2.0 (n = 55), 5.8 ± 2.1 (n = 57), and 3.8 ± 1.8 (n = 57), respectively. The lower mean litter size of Tpst1 −/− ×Tpst1 −/− crosses compared with the other groups was highly statistically significant (p < 10−7). To examine the reproductive performance ofTpst1−/− mice in more detail, virgin femaleTpst1 +/+ and Tpst1 −/−mice from 8 to 20 weeks of age were pair-mated with eitherTpst1 +/+ or Tpst1 −/−males. The results of these matings are shown in TableII. To determine whether and when copulation occurred, females were examined for vaginal plugs each morning. Vaginal plugs were detected in all 20Tpst1 +/+ females mated withTpst1 +/+ or Tpst1 −/−males and in 17 of the 20 Tpst1 −/− females mated with Tpst1 +/+ orTpst1 −/− males. The time between the set up of these matings and the detection of vaginal plugs was not different inTpst1 +/+ (2.6 ± 1.1 days,n = 20) and Tpst1 −/− females (2.6 ± 0.9 days, n = 17). These data indicate that the copulatory behavior of both Tpst1 −/−males and females is normal and that the estrous cycle length inTpst1 −/− females is normal.Table IIReproductive performance of Tpst1 −/− miceGroupMaleFemale nCopulationsLittersLitter size2-aValues are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of the indicated number of matings.Live birthsPerinatal deathsSurviving pups %1+ /++ /+101095.9 ± 1.8530532− /−+ /+101096.3 ± 1.7570573+ /+− /−10994.1 ± 1.5379 (24)284− /−− /−10863.2 ± 1.9196 (32)13Animals were mated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One-way analysis of variance was used to determine the overall statistical differences in the litter sizes of each experimental group (p = 0.0032).

The size of the litters from Tpst1 +/+ ×Tpst1 +/+ crosses was indistinguishable from matings of Tpst1 −/− males andTpst1 +/+ females (group 1 versus 2,p = 0.59). This demonstrates that the fertility ofTpst1 −/− males is normal. However, when wild-type males were mated with Tpst1 −/−females, litter sizes were significantly reduced compared with the groups in which the females were wild-type irrespective of the genotype of the male (group 1 versus 3, p = 0.035; group 2 versus 3, p = 0.0099). WhenTpst1 −/− males were mated withTpst1 −/− females, litter sizes were similarly reduced (group 1 versus 4, p = 0.0052; group 2 versus 4, p = 0.0015) but were not significantly different from crosses of wild-type males andTpst1 −/− females (group 3 versus 4,p = 0.30). These results show that the reduced litter size observed in Tpst1 −/− females results exclusively from TPST-1 deficiency in the female and is independent of the genotype of the sire or the fetus. In addition, we observed that homozygosity in the female was associated with a striking incidence of perinatal mortality. In these experiments, 15 of 56 (28%) live births to Tpst1 −/− females were found dead within 48 h of birth, whereas no death occurred in litters from wild-type females (Table II). Furthermore, over a 1-year period of observation, we observed a perinatal death rate of 3.9% inTpst1 +/+ × Tpst1 +/+crosses (12 of 355 live births, 57 litters), 3.7% inTpst1 +/− × Tpst1 +/−crosses (12 of 327 live births, 57 litters), and 18.6% inTpst1 −/− × Tpst1 −/−crosses (40 of 218 live births, 57 litters). In all cases neonates found dead were morphologically normal. The synchrony of reproductive performance over time also appears to be disturbed in Tpst1 −/− females.Tpst1 +/+ × Tpst1 +/+(Group 1), Tpst1 −/− ×Tpst1 +/+ (Group 2), andTpst1 +/+ × Tpst1 −/−(Group 3) crosses were set up using 8–10-week-old virgin females, and the number and timing of litters and litter size were followed for 18 weeks (Fig. 3). Each mating pair was continuously housed together, and litters were weaned promptly at 21 days of age. Over 18 weeks the number of litters produced in each group was not statistically different. However, the number of pups per litter from Tpst1 −/− females (Group 3) was consistently lower over time compared with litters fromTpst1 +/+ females irrespective of the genotype of the male (groups 1 and 2). It was also noted that the timing of litters from Tpst1 +/+ females (groups 1 and 2) was quite synchronous over the 18-week observation period. In contrast, this was not the case with Tpst1 −/− females (group 3). To evaluate the cause of the low litter sizes from Tpst1 −/− females, timed matings between wild-type males and age-matched female wild-type orTpst1 −/− mice were set up. Females were examined for vaginal plugs each morning, plugged females were sacrificed at 15.5 dpc, and the uterine contents were examined. An embryo was considered viable if the size and morphology were consistent with 15.5 dpc. An embryo was considered to be resorbed if a placental remnant could be identified. The number of implantations was defined as the number of viable embryos plus the number of resorbed embryos. We observed that the frequency of fetal loss was three times"

This indicates the existence of an ancient platinum group element reservoir with a supra-chondritic Pt/Os ratio. Such a ratio may be produced in the outer core as a result of inner core crystallization that fractionates Os from Pt. However, if the iridosmine Os isotopic compositions are a signature of the outer core, then the inner core must have formed very early, within several hundred million years after the accretion of Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2026108006,"Under physiological conditions, manganese(II) exhibits catalase-like activity. However, at elevated concentrations, it induces apoptosis via a non-mitochondria-mediated mechanism (Oubrahim, H., Stadtman, E. R., and Chock, P. B. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 9505–9510). In this study, we show that the Mn(II)-induced apoptosis, as monitored by caspase-3-like activity, in NIH3T3 cells was inhibited by calpain inhibitors I and II or the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB202190. The control experiments showed that each of these inhibitors in the concentration ranges used exerted no effect on activated caspase-3-like activity. Furthermore, caspase-12 was cleaved in Mn(II)-treated cells, suggesting that the Mn(II)-induced apoptosis is mediated by caspase-12. This notion is confirmed by the observations that pretreatment of NIH3T3 cells with either caspase-12 antisense RNA or dsRNA corresponding to the full-length caspase-12 led to a dramatic decrease in caspase-3-like activity induced by Mn(II). The precise mechanism by which Mn(II) induced the apoptosis is not clear. Nevertheless, Mn(II), in part, exerts its effect via its ability to replace Ca(II) in the activation of m-calpain, which in turn activates caspase-12 and degrades Bcl-xL.

Here we show by the dsRNAi and antisense RNA methods that the observed Mn(II)-induced apoptosis is mediated by caspase-12 known to localize in the ER. MnCl2 4H2O (99.9%) (MnII) was from Aldrich. Materials for protein electrophoresis and poly(vindylidenedifluoride) membrane (0.2 μm) were purchased from Bio-Rad. The caspase-3 substrate, DEVD-AMC, was from PharMingen. Anti-caspase-12 antibody was kindly provided by J. Yuan of Harvard Medical School. Primers and antisense were synthesized by biosynthesis. Megascript T7 used for dsRNA synthesis was purchased from Ambion. Highly pure PCR product purification kits were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and penetratin 1 was from Appligene. The inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SB202190 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)IH-imidazole) and calpain inhibitors I (N-Ac-l-l-norleucinal) and II (N-Ac-LLM-CHO) were purchased from Calbiochem. NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium (DMEM) containing high glucose (4.5 g/liter, 25 mm) and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum without heat inactivation, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was changed every other day. All Mn(II) treatments were performed in culture medium (DMEM) containing 10% serum. Just prior to treatment, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium. Total RNA was isolated from NIH3T3 cells using the TriZol reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. RT-PCR was performed using Superscrit II (Invitrogen) on 5 μg of total RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions (100 μl) were performed with 2 μl of reverse transcriptase reaction mixtures that contained 0.5 μm of the forward 5′ ATGGCGGCCAGGAGGACACATG 3′ and reverse 5′ GTTGCCTGTGCTAATTCCCGGG 3′ primers to amplify caspase-12 to full length. PCR products were purified and resuspended in 10 μl of water. Full-length caspase-12 cDNA was amplified by PCR. The primers used in the PCR reaction contained a 5′ T7 RNA polymerase binding site (GAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA) followed by sequences specific for caspase-12 (forward, 5′ ATGGCGGCCAGGAGGACACATG 3′ and reverse, GTTGCCTGTGCTCATTCCCGGG 3′). The PCR products were purified by using the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The purified PCR products were used as templates for the MegascriptT7 transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) to produce dsRNA. The dsRNA products were precipitated with lithium chloride and resuspended in 1 mm Tris buffer. The dsRNAs were annealed by incubation at 65 °C for 60 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature for at least 50 min. The dsRNA was analyzed by scoring shifts in mobility with respect to ssRNA on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and edithium bromide staining. The dsRNA was stored at 20 °C until use. NIH3T3 cells were harvested using an 0.25% trypsin solution and washed twice with a pulsing buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm phosphate, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.2. 5105 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer and electroporated as described by Tekle et al. (18Tekle E. Astumian R.D. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4230-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The cells were then cultured for 48 h at 37 °C before treatment with Mn(II) for another 24 h. Coupling and treatment of penetratin 1 and antisense of caspase-12 were as described previously (19Troy C.M. Derossi D. Prochiantz A. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 253-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of 5′-thiol-modified antisense caspase-12 and its scramble oligonucleotide used were derived from Nakagawa et al. (10Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). They are TGTCCTCCTGGCCGCCATGCGTGT-3′-amino linker and GTCGCTCTGTGACGCCTGTGCCTG-3′-amino linker, respectively. 10 μl of cellular extract (or buffer only for the blank) were mixed with 200 μl of ICE standard buffer (100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin) containing 1 μm DEVD-AMC. The fluorogenic product, AMC, was monitored with 380 nm excitation and 460 nm emission wavelength using a Cytofluor 4000 fluorescent multiwell plate reader. Caspase activity was normalized for protein concentration of individual extract and compared with the caspase-3 activity in the control sample. Equal amounts of total cellular protein were separated by 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes along with prestained molecular weight markers at 30 V for 90 min. Blots were blocked with 5% dry milk in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 for 60 min and probed with the appropriate antibodies (1 μg/ml in blocking buffer) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with 0.5% PBS-Tween, membranes were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 120 min (dilution of 1:5000). Specific proteins were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence system. In some cases, blots were reprobed with different antibodies after stripping for 30 min in buffer containing 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS. Equal protein loading was controlled by Amido Black staining of membranes. Nakagawa and Yuan (20Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar) showed that m-calpain can cleave procaspase-12 and cleave the loop region of Bcl-xL and lead to caspase activation and the loss of anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-xL, respectively. To study the role of calpain in Mn(II)-induced apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells, we treated cells with both Mn(II) (0.5 mm) and calpain inhibitor I or II. Fig. 1shows that both calpain inhibitors at concentrations of 50 and 100 μm were able to significantly reduce the caspase-3 activity induced by Mn(II) relative to that observed in Mn(II)-treated cells. No significant differences in caspase-3 activity were observed when similar concentrations of calpain inhibitors I and II were added to the untreated control cells. Furthermore, when calpain inhibitor I was added to samples containing Mn(II)-activated caspases, no inhibition was observed (data not shown). These results show that calpain is, at least in part, involved in the activation of caspase-3 in response to Mn(II). Activation of the p38 MAP kinase has been shown to precede apoptosis induced by stress in some cells and is associated with cytokine expression and proliferation in other cells (21Merritt C. Enslen H. Diehl N. Conze D. Davis R.J. Rincon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). SB202190 is a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase. To investigate whether Mn(II)-induced stress can be overcome by SB202190, we studied its effect on Mn(II)-mediated apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells. Fig. 2 shows that when NIH3T3 were incubated together with 0.5 mm Mn(II) and two different concentrations of SB202190 (1 and 2 μm) for 24 h, the caspase-3 activation was significantly inhibited relative to that observed with only Mn(II). However, the p38 inhibitor exerted no effect on caspase-3 activity in cells unless it was present during the Mn(II) treatment (Fig. 2). Moreover, it had no effect on caspase-3 activity induced by prior treatment with Mn(II) (data not shown). Since the apoptosis induced by Mn(II) is not a mitochondria-mediated process (17Oubrahim H. Stadtman E.R. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9505-9510Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we investigated the possible involvement of caspase-12 in this apoptotic pathway. When NIH3T3 cells were treated with 0.5 or 1.0 mmMn(II) for 24 h, we found that relative to the untreated cells, the 60-kDa procaspase-12 was reduced in a Mn(II) concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3). This observation is consistent with the fact that Mn(II), in place of Ca(II), can activate m-calpain (data not shown). The reduction of procaspase-12 was also observed when the cells were incubated with 10 μmA23187 ionophore for 24 h (see Fig. 3), a condition known to induce apoptosis. To study the involvement of caspase-12 in Mn(II)-mediated apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells, we interfered with the synthesis of caspase-12 by (i) transfecting the cells with caspase-12 antisense RNA and (ii) “knocking out” the enzyme using the dsRNA-mediated interference of gene expression method. When NIH3T3 cells were transfected with caspase-12 antisense RNA for 6 h and then treated with 0.5 mm Mn(II) for 24 h, a significant decrease in caspase-3 activity was observed in comparison to that found in the untransfected cells (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 5). The caspase-3 activity of cells that were treated with caspase-12 antisense was comparable with that of non-treated cells. Moreover, Fig. 4, lane 4, shows that the scramble oligonucleotide was insufficient to lower caspase-3 activity in response to Mn(II) treatment. This result suggests that caspase-12 is required for the activation of caspase-3 induced by Mn(II) in NIH3T3 cells. To further confirm that caspase-12 is the enzyme mediating the Mn(II)-induced apoptosis, we made use of a relatively new and effective method, the dsRNAi (22Fire A., Xu, S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11430) Google Scholar, 23Tuschl T. Zamore P.D. Lehmann R. Bartel D.P. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3191-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), to knock out caspase-12 by interfering with its gene expression. Caspase-12 dsRNA was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and introduced into cells by electroporation. The treated NIH3T3 cells were allowed to grow for 48 h prior to the addition of 0.5 mm Mn(II) and then incubated for 24 h. To make sure that caspase-12 in these cells was knocked out, the mRNA for the procaspase-12 was converted by reverse transcriptase to its corresponding cDNA and amplified by PCR. The results as shown in Fig. 5C indicate that caspase-12 mRNA was found in non-treated cells, while none of this RNA was detected in dsRNA-treated cells. Fig. 5D shows that the dsRNAi-treated cells exhibited almost total protection from Mn(II)-induced apoptosis as indicated by their capacity to prevent Mn(II)-induced caspase-3 activation. The control experiments showed that the dsRNAi-treated cells exhibited no change in their appearance (not shown) or their caspase-3 activity (Fig. 5D, lane 2). Taken together, these results show that caspase-12 is essential for Mn(II)-mediated apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells.Figure 5Effect of caspase-12 knock-out by the dsRNAi method on Mn(II)-induced caspase-3 activation.

D, the full-length dsRNAS was introduced into NIH3T3 cells by electroporation 48 h prior to the 24-h incubation with 0.5 mm Mn(II) as indicated. Cells were incubated in the absence (lanes 1 and 2) or presence (lanes 3 and 4) of 0.5 mm Mn(II) for 24 h. Control cells (white bars) and dsRNA-treated cells (black bars). The caspase-3 activity was measured as described in the legend to Fig. 1.FAU, fluorescence arbitrary unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although Mn(II) in the micromolar concentration range can protect cells against oxidative stress, we previously showed that in high concentrations, e.g. 0.5–2 mm, Mn(II) induced HeLa cells to undergo apoptosis mediated by caspase-3 activation (17Oubrahim H. Stadtman E.R. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9505-9510Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). At high Mn(II) concentrations, we also observed an elevation of ROS, as detected by intracellular 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate oxidation and Mn(II)-SOD generation. However, unlike most ROS-induced apoptosis, the apoptosis caused by elevated Mn(II) is not mediated by the mitochondrial pathway (17Oubrahim H. Stadtman E.R. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9505-9510Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our current results indicate that the Mn(II)-induced activation of caspase-3 is mediated through caspase-12 activation, and caspase-12 is known to be associated with ER-mediated apoptosis (10Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar, 11Liu H. Miller E. vande Water B. Stevens J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33869-33874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of caspase-12 in Mn(II)-induced apoptosis, we used NIH3T3 cells, because the apoptotic effect in HeLa cells was also observed in NIH3T3 cells, and the anti-caspase-12 antibody raised in mice works best with murine caspase-12. Our results show that with antisense caspase-12 treatment, the Mn(II)-induced caspase-3 activation was reduced about 70% (Fig. 4), while knocking out caspase-12 with the dsRNAi technique essentially eliminated the Mn(II)-dependent caspase-3 activation (Fig. 5). Together, these data indicate that caspase-12 is required for the Mn(II)-induced apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells. It should be pointed out that the dsRNAi method is an effective technique for suppressing the expression of the DNA of a given protein. It provides a total knock-out of caspase-12 as shown in Fig. 5C and thus totally eliminated the Mn(II)-induced apoptosis (see Fig. 5D). The full-length dsRNA-treated cells maintained null caspase-12 conditions for at least 3 days without apoptosis. Caspase-12 is localized on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. It has been identified as an upstream caspase in the ER-mediated apoptotic pathway (10Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar), initiated in response to ER stress, such as protein misfolding, protein retention, and disruption of Ca(II) homeostasis in ER (24Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 293-300PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It appears that activation of caspase-12 is independent of either death receptor signaling or mitochondrial-targeted apoptotic signals (26Daniel P.T. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2000; 14: 2035-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), since apoptosis induced by serum deprivation, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or anti-Fas did not lead to caspase-12 activation. However, ER stress inducers, such as brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ER-Golgi transport, thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca(II) ATPase, and A23187, a Ca(II) ionophore, have been shown to activate caspase-12 and lead to apoptosis (10Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). Calpain has been shown to cleave Bcl-xL and procaspase-12 in vitro and lead to the loss of anti-apoptotic function and caspase-12 activation, respectively (12Rao R.V. Hermel E. Castro-Obregon S. del Rio G. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33869-33874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). However, there are no clear data to show that calpain is the one that catalyzes the activation of procaspase-12 in vivo. Recent studies showed that caspase-12 can be activated by caspase-7, which forms a complex with procaspase-12 (12Rao R.V. Hermel E. Castro-Obregon S. del Rio G. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33869-33874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), and procaspase-12 can also bind to TRAF2, an adoptor protein that couples the plasma membrane receptor to c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, and to IRE1, an ER stress sensor protein kinase (27Yoneda T. Imaigumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Goni F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13935-13940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 1, calpain inhibitors I and II inhibited caspase-12 activation, and the Ca(II) ionophore A23187 facilitated the cleavage of procaspase-12. Together, these results indicate that Ca(II), in part working through its ability to activate m-calpain (results not shown), plays a major role in caspase-12-mediated apoptosis. This could be accomplished via the cleavage of either procaspase-12, Bcl-xL, or both. The fact that the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB202190, also exerted strong inhibition of Mn(II)-induced apoptosis indicates the participation of p38 MAP kinase whose activation has been associated with the apoptotic signaling cascade. However, the substrate(s) of this kinase in the regulatory pathway of caspase-12-mediated apoptosis is not known. Nevertheless, both procaspase-12 and one of its binding proteins, TRAF2, have been reported to be phosphorylated by unidentified kinase(s) (27Yoneda T. Imaigumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Goni F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13935-13940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). It is clear that much more work is needed to elucidate this signaling mechanism. In conclusion, together with the earlier report (17Oubrahim H. Stadtman E.R. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9505-9510Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we show that Mn(II) induced apoptosis in HeLa and NIH3T3 cells via a caspase-12-dependent pathway and independent of the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. The apoptosis is inhibited by both calpain inhibitors I and II and by the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB202190. The results suggest that both calpain and the p38 kinase are involved sequentially without indicating the sequence in activating caspase-12. The role of Mn(II), in part, is to substitute for Ca(II) in activating m-calpain and cause the apoptosis. It should be pointed out that the full-length dsRNAi method works well with NIH3T3 cells, and it is the method of choice for knocking out selected proteins."

In contrast toXvent-2B and other members of the Xvent-2 subfamily,Xvent-1B is not a direct response gene of bone morphogenetic protein-4 signaling. Xvent-1B is activated by Xvent-2, but CHX experiments revealed the requirement of additional factors. In this study, we report on the cooperative effect of Xvent-2 and the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-2 on the promoter of the Xvent-1B gene. We show thatGATA-2 is a direct target gene of bone morphogenetic protein-4 and that GATA-2 interacts with Xvent-2 to activate transcription of Xvent-1B. Both transcription factors bind to distinct elements within the Xvent-1B promoter, and GATA-2 physically interacts with the C-terminal domain of Xvent-2. Promoter/reporter studies in Xenopus embryos revealed that full activation of Xvent-1B requires both Xvent-2 and GATA-2. Moreover, the two factors are sufficient to direct transcription of Xvent-1B in the presence of CHX at the ventral side of the embryo.

One of the first steps in the early development in Xenopus laevis is the accumulation of β-catenin in the future dorsal signaling center, the Nieuwkoop center (1Larabell C.A. Torres M. Rowning B.A. Yost C. Miller J., Wu, R.M. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The interaction of β-catenin with high mobility group box transcription factors of the LEF/TCF1 family leads to the activation of other dorsal factors such as the homeobox transcription factor siamois (2Brannon M. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). All of these molecules are components of the dorsal Wnt signaling pathway and result, when ectopically expressed on the ventral side, in a dorsalization of the embryo and formation of a second axis (3Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kühl M. Bruhn D. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). Another important signaling pathway in early embryogenesis is the BMP pathway which, in contrast to the dorsal Wnt signal, is responsible for the activation of ventral molecules (4Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar, 5Graff J.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 171-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, it has been shown that the autoregulatory loop of BMP-4 expression is mediated by the ventral homeobox protein Xvent-2 (6Schuler-Metz A. Knöchel S. Kaufmann E. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34365-34374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because Xvents can mimic all early BMP-2/4 effects, the Xvent transcription factors are regarded as downstream effectors of BMP-2/4 signaling in early amphibian development (7Lemaire P.

Based upon amino acid sequence comparisons, members of the Xvent family are divided into two subfamilies, the Xvent-1 (Xvent-1 (8Gawantka V. Delius H. Hirschfeld K. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C.

Development. 1996; 122: 3045-3053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Xbr-1b (12Papalopulu N. Kintner C. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), Xom (13Ladher R. Mohun T.J. Smith J.C. Snape A.M. Development. 1996; 122: 2385-2394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Vox 15 (14) and Xvent-2B (10Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)) subfamilies. Besides their sequence divergence, the two groups differ clearly in their expression patterns, which already suggests different regulatory mechanisms. It has been shown that Xvent-2B is a direct target gene of BMP signaling (10Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The BMP mediator Smad1, which is phosphorylated by the BMP type I receptor, interacts with Smad4 to build a transcriptionally active complex on the Xvent-2B promoter (17Henningfeld K.A. Rastegar S. Adler G. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21827-21835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This is part of a subsequent, indirect autoregulatory loop in which BMP-4 induces its own expression by using Xvent-2 as a mediator (6Schuler-Metz A. Knöchel S. Kaufmann E. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34365-34374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and a direct autoregulatory loop in which Xvent-2 activates its own expression (19Henningfeld K.A. Friedle H. Rastegar S. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2097-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, Xvent-1B is not up-regulated by BMP signaling in the absence of de novo protein synthesis and, therefore, is not regarded as a direct BMP-4 target (10Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Instead,Xvent-1B can be activated by Xvent-2; and because it can rescue the phenotype caused by the dominant-negative Xvent-2 P(40) mutant, it has been suggested that Xvent-1 acts downstream of Xvent-2 (10Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, Xvent-2, like BMP-4, is not capable of activating members of the Xvent-1 family in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX). This suggests that either another or an additional factor is necessary for the activation of Xvent-1B. This factor could either be produced by a target gene of Xvent-2, or it might synergize with Xvent-2 in a cooperative manner. One possible candidate factor seemed to be the zinc finger protein GATA-2 (20Zon L.I. Mather C. Burgess S. Bolce M.E. Harland R.M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10642-10646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which activatesXvent-1, and when overexpressed as a dominant-interfering construct, had been shown to suppress specifically expression of theXvent-1 but not of the Xvent-2 gene (21Sykes T.G. Rodaway A.R.F. Walmsley M.E. Patient R.K. Development. 1998; 125: 4595-4605PubMed Google Scholar). TheGATA-2 gene is induced by BMP-4 (22Maeno M. Mead P.E. Kelley C., Xu, R.H. Kung H.F. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Zon L.I. Blood. 1996; 88: 1965-1972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and GATA-2 expression in ventral mesoderm starts at the early gastrula stage (23Kelley C. Yee K. Harland R. Zon L.I. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar),i.e. at the right time and at the right place to suggest this factor as an additional player in the in vivoregulation of Xvent-1 transcription. In the present report we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the Xvent-1B gene by Xvent-2 and GATA-2. We have found that GATA-2 is able to activate the Xvent-1Bpromoter and that it rescues the effects induced by a dominant-negative Xvent-2 mutant. In contrast, blocking BMP signaling at the level of the BMP receptor, which leads to an inhibition of endogenous Xvent-2 gene activity, cannot be compensated for by GATA-2. Therefore, it seems unlikely that GATA-2 operates downstream of Xvent-2. Instead, this observation favors a model of a cooperative action between Xvent-2 and GATA-2 in the activation of Xvent-1B. To test this model we have performed protein-DNA binding assays. We could define target elements for both Xvent-2 and GATA-2 factors on the Xvent-1promoter. It could also be shown that GATA-2 interacts directly with the C-terminal domain of the Xvent-2 protein. Analysis of the Xvent-1B promoter by microinjection of different deletion mutants further supports the cooperative function of these two transcription factors. Whereas activation by GATA-2 is strictly dependent on Xvent-2 binding elements, Xvent-2 also seems to activate Xvent-1B in a GATA-2 independent manner, albeit at a much lower extent. Furthermore, although Xvent-2 is unable to activate Xvent-1B in the presence of CHX, a combination of Xvent-2 and GATA-2 is sufficient to up-regulate Xvent-1Bexpression if injected on the ventral side. However, overexpression of GATA-2 and Xvent-2 on the dorsal side does not lead to an activation ofXvent-1B transcription in CHX-treated embryos, even if coinjected with BMP-4. This suggests that activation ofXvent-1B on the ventral side of embryos in vivois the result not only of the presence of Xvent-2 and GATA-2 proteins, but also the absence of dorsal inhibitors. Xvent-1B promoter fragments were created by PCR using the following primers: upstream, –249 (5′-CGGGATCCATGGGATTCTGTGCCG-3′), −164 (5′-CGGGATCCACTGGAGCCAGGACCAGG-3′); downstream, +52 (5′-CCCAAGCTTCTGAAGGGAAGGCTGCT-3′), –164 (5′-CGGGATCCGAGTCTGTCAGGTTAGTG-3′). Nucleotide positions refer to the published sequence (10Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR products were digested with BamHI/HindIII and cloned into BglII/HindIII of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The Xvent-1B/pGL3 construct −55/+52 was obtained by digesting the –164/+52 PCR fragment with Sau3A and the –249/Δ/+52 construct by fusing the –249/−164 and –55/+52 fragments. The GATA-mutated (Gm) Xvent-1B promoter fragment (−249/Gm/+52) was constructed by fusion of two PCR-generated fragments via an artificial EcoRI site using the following primers: upstream fragment, −249 (as described) and –192 (5′-GGAATTCTTGGAGGTTTCAGTTGGAG-3′); downstream fragment, –197 (5′-GGAATTCAAGGTGAAATCACTAACCTG-3′) and +52 (as described). The PCR products were digested withBamHI/EcoRI (−249/−192) or withEcoRI/HindIII (−197/+52) and ligated at theirEcoRI restriction sites. A mutation of the putative LEF/TCF binding site was introduced by fusing the –55/+52 promoter construct with a PCR fragment generated by using the –249 upstream primer (see above) and a mutated reverse primer starting at –52 (5′-CGGGATCCATATAAGCGGGAGAACCAGAA-3′; mutated positions are underlined). Microinjections were performed with in vitro fertilized Xenopusembryos, dejellied in 2% cysteine hydrochloride in 0.1 × MBSH (10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.66 mm KNO3) and staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (24Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). Before injection, embryos were placed into 1 × MBSH containing 4% Ficoll. Deletion mutants were injected dorsally or ventrally at the four-cell stage (20 pg/blastomere). In vitro transcribed capped mRNAs (mMessage-mMachine™ SP6 Kit, Ambion) were purified over RNeasy columns (Qiagen) for microinjection. Linearization and transcription of DNA were performed as indicated: pSP64T3-BMP-4 (Xenopus BMP-4,BamHI, SP6); pSP64T3-Xvent-2 (Xvent-2, EcoRI, SP6); pSP64-GATA-2 (NotI, SP6). RNA was injected at the following concentrations: 500 pg/blastomere BMP-4, 200–400 pg/blastomere Xvent-2, 50 pg/blastomere GATA-2. As an internal control, the pRL-CMV renilla reporter plasmid (Promega) was coinjected to allow for normalization of firefly luciferase values. Injected embryos were cultured until stage 11 and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol, except that 10 μl of passive lysis buffer was used per embryo (Dual Luciferase Assay System, Promega). Luciferase activities of firefly and renilla were determined separately using 20 μl of supernatant (centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C). Fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)Plus (Stratagene) and purified as described recently by Henningfeld et al. (19Henningfeld K.A. Friedle H. Rastegar S. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2097-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).35S-Labeled proteins were prepared using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). Protein extracts containing Myc-tagged Xvent-2 (MT-Xvent-2) were essentially prepared as reported previously (19Henningfeld K.A. Friedle H. Rastegar S. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2097-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) an equal amount (5 μg) of purified GST or GST fusion proteins and 5 μl of 35S-labeled proteins were added. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h (rotating slowly), the reactions were washed four times with wash buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40), and 30 μl of 2 × SDS loading buffer was added. The samples were boiled 5 min and analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was Coomassie stained to visualize GST proteins, dried, and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. For pull-down assays from cell extracts, experiments were performed with 25 μg of total protein from Xenopus. Western analysis was performed with the anti-Myc antibody 9E10. Xenopus embryos were injected into both dorsal and ventral blastomeres at the four-cell stage with 500 pg of BMP-4, 400 pg of Xvent-2, or 50 pg of GATA-2 RNA. Lithium treatment was carried out at stage 5 for 15 min with 300 mm lithium chloride. At stage 7.0 embryos were treated with 25 μg/ml CHX (Sigma) until control embryos reached stage 10.5. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy minicolumns (Qiagen; RNeasy protocol for isolation of total RNA from animal tissues). DNase digestion was performed by adding 1.5 μl of RNase-free DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 5 μl of 25 mm MgCl2 to 50 μl of total RNA. The reaction was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C followed by inactivation of DNase by heating for 10 min at 75 °C. cDNA synthesis was performed under the following conditions: 1 × RT reaction buffer (AmershamBiosciences), 10 ng of (dT)12–18, 10 ng of random primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 26.8 units of RNAguard™ RNase inhibitor (Amersham Biosciences), 10 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Biosciences), and 600 ng of total RNA. For PCRs the following primers and annealing conditions were used. For histone H4, the upstream primer was 5′-CGGGATAACATTCAGGGTATCACT-3′, and the downstream primer was 5′-ATCCATGGCGGTAACTGTCTTCCT-3′ with 56 °C annealing temperature. For Xvent-1B, the upstream primer was 5′-TTCCCTTCAGCATGGTTCAA-3′, and the downstream primer was 5′-GCATCTCCTTGGCATATTTGG-3′ with 56 °C annealing temperature. For GATA-2, the upstream primer was 5′-AGGAACTTTCCAGGTGCATGCAGGAG-3′, and the downstream primer was 5′-CGAGGTGCAAATTATTATGTTAC-3′ with 56 °C annealing temperature. LightCycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) reactions were set up according to the manufacturer (SYBR-green fast start protocol) and using the following primers: ODC (upstream primer, 5′-CAAAGCTTGTTCTACGCATAGCA-3′; downstream primer, 5′-GGTGGCACCAAATTTCACACT-3′) and Xvent-1B (upstream primer, 5′-GCTGCAGTATTTCAGTCCT-3′; downstream primer, 5′-ATCTGATTTGGTACTTTTCCCA-3′). The desired promoter fragments were excised from the pBSII KS+ (−249/−13,XbaI/DdeI; −249/−164,XbaI/EcoRI) or pGL3 vector (–164/−13,NheI/DdeI) and 3′-labeled on one strand by a fill-in reaction with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow DNA polymerase. Binding reactions were carried out on ice for 30 min in 30 μl of binding buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 13.2% glycerol) containing 1 μg poly(dI-dC) and 1 ng of the gel-purified probe. After 5 min of preincubation, the protein was added and incubated for 30 min. The probes were separated on 7% native acrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris-borate. Binding reactions for DNase I footprinting were prepared and incubated as described under “Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay.” The concentration of MgCl2 was subsequently raised to 5 mm for DNase I footprinting, and 0.065 unit (free DNA) or 0.195 unit (DNA + protein) of DNase I was added at room temperature for 45 s. The DNase I digestion was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of sample buffer (66% deionized formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 660 mm sucrose). Sequencing reactions were performed according to the method of Maxam and Gilbert (25Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). After preelectrophoresis for 2 h at 70 W, samples were analyzed by 7% denaturing PAGE at 60 W in 1 × Tris-borate-EDTA. Localization of Xvent-1B transcripts in gastrula stage embryos was demonstrated by whole mount in situ hybridization using a digoxygenin-labeled antisense RNA (10Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because Xvent-2 has been shown not to be sufficient to activate Xvent-1B in the presence of CHX (10Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we have been searching for additional factors. One candidate was the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-2, which is induced by BMP signaling (22Maeno M. Mead P.E. Kelley C., Xu, R.H. Kung H.F. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Zon L.I. Blood. 1996; 88: 1965-1972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that GATA-2 activates Xvent-1 and that a dominant-interfering GATA-2 (G2en) specifically suppressesXvent-1 but has no effect upon Xvent-2 expression (21Sykes T.G. Rodaway A.R.F. Walmsley M.E. Patient R.K. Development. 1998; 125: 4595-4605PubMed Google Scholar). This prompted us to analyze whether GATA-2 is a direct BMP target gene and to investigate the effects of GATA-2 on theXvent-1 gene and the Xvent-1 promoter. First, RT-PCR analysis was performed to study the BMP-4 induced activation of GATA-2. BMP-4 RNA was injected into embryos at the four-cell stage, CHX was added (10Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) at stage 7.0 prior to MBT, and the embryos were cultured until control embryos had reached midgastrula (stage 10.5). Fig. 1 A shows that BMP-4 leads to an increase of GATA-2 transcripts in both the absence and presence of CHX. This indicates that BMP-4 being translated at early cleavage stages is sufficient to activate zygotic transcription of GATA-2 after MBT even in the absence of protein biosynthesis. We next have analyzed whether GATA-2 is a regulator of Xvent-1B expression. In agreement with previous reports (21Sykes T.G. Rodaway A.R.F. Walmsley M.E. Patient R.K. Development. 1998; 125: 4595-4605PubMed Google Scholar) we find that GATA 2 leads to a distinct up-regulation ofXvent-1B; however, no transcripts are detected when injected embryos were treated with CHX (Fig. 1 B). Dorsal activation of Xvent-1B in GATA-2 or Xvent-2 RNA-injected embryos was also demonstrated by whole mount in situ hybridization (Fig.1, C–E). Although both factors led to an ectopic expression of Xvent-1B RNA within the dorsal marginal zone, only Xvent-2 renders expression within the most dorsal located region, the Spemann organizer. Taken together, our results suggest that GATA-2is a direct target of BMP-4 signaling and that GATA-2 activatesXvent-1B, but that additional factors are required because activation occurs only in the presence of protein biosynthesis. To investigate the involvement of GATA-2 in the activation of theXvent-1B promoter and to find out whether it acts downstream of Xvent-2 or in a parallel, cooperative mode, we have used the previously described −249/+52 Xvent-1B promoter fragment fused to a luciferase reporter (10Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and performed coinjections of GATA-2 with the dominant-negative Xvent-2 P(40) RNA (26Onichtchouk D. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Development. 1998; 125: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with truncated BMP type I receptor (tBR) RNA (27Graff J.M. Thies R.S. Song J.J. Celeste A.J. Melton D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), respectively. As shown in Fig.2, GATA-2 can rescue the suppression caused by Xvent-2 P(40). This would still be in line with the downstream as well as with the parallel mechanism for the activation ofXvent-1B. However, coinjections of GATA-2 RNA with tBR RNA do not lead to an increase of luciferase activity compared with the lowered activity caused by injections of tBR. Because tBR injection suppresses Xvent-2 transcription, these results suggest that GATA-2 action needs endogenous Xvent-2 protein. They further argue for the cooperative model because blocking the BMP signaling cascade at the level of the BMP receptor leads to a loss of Xvent-2 protein in the affected cells and therefore prevents GATA-2 from up-regulating theXvent-1B promoter. To find out whether Xvent-2 physically interacts with GATA-2, we prepared a GST-Xvent-2 fusion construct and performed pull-down assays with radiolabeled GATA-2 protein. Fig. 3 A shows that GATA-2 can interact with the GST-Xvent-2 fusion protein, whereas GST alone is not able to bind to GATA-2 under these conditions. To confirm this result and to investigate whether in vivotranslated Xvent-2 binds to GATA-2, a GST-GATA-2 fusion protein was constructed and incubated with Xenopus extracts containing Myc-tagged Xvent-2 protein. As shown by immunoblotting in Fig.3 B, binding of Xvent-2 and GATA-2 was also detected under these circumstances. Additional experiments revealed that GST-GATA-2 was also able to bind to radiolabeled Xvent-2 P(40) (see Fig.3 C). This is an important finding because GATA-2 RNA injection resulted in a rescue of luciferase activity suppressed by injection of this dominant-negative Xvent-2 RNA. To gain more information about the interaction of GATA-2 and Xvent-2, we performed pull-down experiments with different Xvent-2 mutants lacking either the N-terminal (Xvent-2ΔN) or the C-terminal domains (Xvent-2ΔC) (Fig. 3 C). Whereas Xvent-2ΔN, which is missing almost half of the full-length protein, binds to GATA-2, Xvent-2ΔC does not, suggesting that interaction of GATA-2 with Xvent-2 requires the C-terminal part of Xvent-2 protein. Thus, it is concluded that GATA-2 binds to the C-terminal domain of Xvent-2 and that this interaction is not disrupted by the P(40) mutation within the homeodomain. The cooperative action of GATA-2 and Xvent-2 suggests that both transcription factors should bind to distinct elements in theXvent-1B promoter. We performed gel shift assays with different Xvent-1B promoter fragments together with bacterially expressed full-length GATA-2 and Xvent-2 proteins. As shown schematically in Fig. 4 A, Xvent-2 and GATA-2 proteins bind to −249/−13 and –249/−164Xvent-1B promoter fragments, respectively. When the 3′-part from positions –164 to −13 was used, only Xvent-2 protein leads to a shift. Using the Xvent-2 P(40) protein, no binding could be detected to any of these promoter fragments. These results suggest that the dominant-negative effect of this mutant is caused by a loss of DNA binding activity. To gain more detailed information about the binding sequences of GATA-2 and Xvent-2, we performed DNase I protection assays using theXvent-1B promoter fragment from position –249 to −13 (Fig.4, B and C). Fig. 4 B shows that GATA-2 protected only one region between positions –202 and –175 containing a canonical GATA-2 binding site 5′-TGATA-3′ (28Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In contrast, Xvent-2 protects two regions (Fig. 4 C), a proximal region within positions –111 and −74 and a more distal region between –229 and –175. These findings confirm the results obtained from the gel shift experiments. The distal region, which overlaps with the GATA-2-protected region, was resolved further into three distinct elements by using a truncated −249/−164 promoter fragment (Fig.4 D). Inspection of all the Xvent-2 binding sites revealed the accumulation of nine motifs (see boxes in Fig. 4) that can be aligned to the consensus sequence 5′-CC/TAAT-3′. This sequence is in good agreement with results obtained from random oligonucleotide selection (29Trindade M. Tada M. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 442-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as well as the recently reported 5′-CTAAT-3′ motif as an Xvent-2 target site on the BMP-4 and Xvent-2genes (6Schuler-Metz A.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2097-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). DNA-protein binding assays have revealed that theXvent-1B promoter contains binding elements for Xvent-2 and GATA-2. To analyze the biological relevance of these elements, we have coinjected different promoter deletions with RNAs for these factors (Fig. 5). The longest mutant used for these experiments (–249/+52 Xvent-1B) contains the GATA-2 as well as the proximal and the distal Xvent-2-binding elements. Coinjections of this promoter fragment with GATA-2 or Xvent-2 RNA result in an increase of luciferase activity. A 5′-deletion starting at position –164 and missing the GATA-2 and distal Xvent-2 binding sites cannot be activated by GATA-2 but is still activated by Xvent-2 RNA injection. This activation is most likely the result of the proximal binding site because a −55/+52 promoter fragment was not activated. Vice versa, a promoter fragment with an internal deletion (−249/Δ/+52) missing the proximal Xvent-2 binding site is also activated by Xvent-2 RNA. Surprisingly, GATA-2"

These enzymes have evolved an elegantly simple strategy for exposing their targets by rotating the phosphodiester bonds surrounding the nucleotide, causing the target base to be flipped out of the DNA helix (16Lau A.Y.

Using the E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase, we have recently reported the first kinetic mechanism of a base-flipping enzyme, defining for the first time the correct temporal sequence of events at the enzyme active site during catalysis (22Wong, I., Lundquist, A. J., Bernards, A. S., and Mosbaugh, D. W. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). Following initial nonspecific binding, the DNA backbone is scanned to locate the site. A protein-induced distortion of the DNA helix at the target site causes the target nucleotide to become mobile, capable of rapid and reversible extrusion from the DNA duplex. The efficient capture of the extruded base, however, requires a protein conformation change, which inserts the side chain of Leu191 into the DNA duplex at the site vacated by the extruded base. This ratchet-like movement by the protein prevents the flipped-out base from returning into the DNA duplex, thereby driving it into the active site of the enzyme to be excised. Crystallographic studies on the catalytic core domain of MutY reveals an active site binding pocket for an extruded adenine (23Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), suggesting that MutY also uses a similar base-flipping reaction mechanism. However, MutY is unique among base-excision repair enzymes in recognizing a mismatch between a damaged 8-oxoguanine and a normal adenine while exclusively catalyzing the removal of the undamaged base (24Chmiel N.H. Golinelli M.P. Francis A.W. David S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Lu A.L. Methods Mol.

Unlike other base-flipping enzymes, the recognition target of MutY must extend beyond the adenine being excised; thus, the characteristic base-flipping reaction mechanism where the extruded base is also the site of the chemical reactions cannot fully explain the mode of target recognition by MutY. Biochemical evidence shows that the C-terminal domain missing from the crystal structure of the catalytic core domain is required for 8-oxoguanine recognition (27Gogos A. Cillo J. Clarke N.D. Lu A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16665-16671Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Li X. Lu A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4593-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Noll D.M. Gogos A.

As MutT uses a binding pocket to recognize the 8-oxoguanine portion of its substrate (32Abeygunawardana C. Weber D.J. Gittis A.G. Frick D.N. Lin J. Miller A.F. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S.

If such a cleft were to exist, then the recognition of an 8-oxoguanine by MutY would likely require the flipping of the non-scissile 8-oxoguanine out of the DNA helix in addition to the expected extrusion of the adenine for excision. However, no direct biochemical or structural evidence currently exists for such a double base-flipping mechanism. Here we report the results of UV cross-linking experiments using 8-bromoguanine-containing oligodeoxyribonucleotides to probe the topological nature of the structural contact between MutY and 8-oxoguanine. In addition, we also show results of real time stopped-flow fluorimetric detection of both 8-oxoguanine and adenine base flipping. These results will be discussed in the context of the existing structural and mechanistic models of base-flipping enzymes to provide direct insight into the mechanism of target recognition and selectivity by MutY.

Overproduced MutY was purified by a protocol adapted from published methods (35Porello S.L. Williams S.D. Kuhn H. Michaels M.L. David S.S. J. Am. Chem.

The MutY concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of ε280 = 77,510m−1cm−1. Purified MutY had an A400 to A280 ratio between 0.15 and 0.19 and was stored in MutY Storage Buffer at −80 °C. Samples (100 μl) containing 1 μm MutY and 0.5 μm DNA in Buffer Y were irradiated at 20 °C for 40 min in a 96-well microtiter plate 5 mm below a UVP Model UVLMS-38 lamp (Upland, CA) set to 302 nm and quenched directly into SDS gel loading buffer. Radiolabeled cross-linked products were separated from uncross-linked DNA by SDS-PAGE on a 12% acrylamide gel and visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Handling of 8-bromoguanine-containing DNA prior to UV irradiation was carried out under reduced illumination provided by a 25-watt red incandescent light bulb using amber-colored microfuge tubes. Single-turnover experiments were performed using a KinTek RFQ-3 Rapid Chemical Quench (KinTek Instruments, State College, PA) instrument maintained at a constant 37 °C with a Neslab RTE-111 refrigerated water bath. Reactions were initiated by rapidly mixing 15 μl of MutY with 15 μl of 5′-32P-labeled duplex DNA substrate and were chemically quenched with 90 μl of 0.2 m NaOH. The abasic site-containing excision products were then heated to 90 °C for 8 min to cleave the phosphoribose backbone of the DNA at the abasic site to generate 10-nucleotide products that were separated from the 21-nucleotide substrates by electrophoresis on a 20% acrylamide, 8m urea gel. Following visualization with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), the intensities of DNA substrate and product bands were quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) as described in Bao et al. (33Bao K.K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12089-12098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and Wong et al. (22Wong, I., Lundquist, A. J., Bernards, A. S., and Mosbaugh, D. W. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). Single-turnover time courses with enzyme present in excess over substrate were fitted to a single exponential function, [P]t =A1(1 −e−kobst). Real time fluorescence changes were measured using a pneumatically driven KinTek SF 2001 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (KinTek Instruments) fitted with a 100-watt mercury arc lamp (OSRAM HBO 103 W/2). Reactions were maintained at a constant 37 °C with a Neslab RTE-111 refrigerated bath. The 2-aminopurine was excited at λex = 313 nm, and its fluorescence emission was monitored at >350 nm using a Thermo Corion LG-350-F filter (Franklin, MA). Time courses were fitted by nonlinear least-square regression to a sum of exponential terms, y= ∑i=1nAi(1−e−kit)+C.In the case of the tPAT:bAOT, where the time course required a lag period, k1 of a triple exponential function, n = 3, was constrained at 110 s−1, whereupon the regression analysis would then return a small negative best-fit value of A1 to account for the lag. To directly detect structural contacts between MutY and 8-oxoguanine, we synthesized the 21-nucleotide bABT with a photoreactive 8-bromoguanine (B) substituted for the 8-oxoguanine (see Table I). Cross-linking experiments were carried out with either 5′-32P-labeled single-stranded *bABT or the duplex tAAT:*bABT containing an adenine:8-bromoguanine mismatch. Single-turnover adenine excision assays performed with tAAT:bABT showed only a ∼2-fold reduction in the rate of excision (data not shown) relative to a “normal” adenine:8-oxoguanine mismatched duplex, tAAT:bAOT, validating the suitability of the 8-bromoguanine substitution in these cross-linking studies. Cross-linked products formed after irradiation at 302 nm for 40 min were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig. 1 shows the results of experiments carried out at 1 μm MutY and 0.5 μm DNA, conditions under which active site titration experiments indicated near maximal productive binding of substrate DNA (data not shown). A distinct radiolabeled band consistent with DNA-cross-linked MutY appeared with either single-stranded *bABT (Lane 4) or duplex tAAT:*bABT (Lane 8) with the former showing moderately higher efficiency of cross-linking. The overall extent of cross-linking (<10%) was poor partly due to the non-optimal wavelength of irradiation. Significantly better cross-linking was observed with irradiation at 254 nm; however, we chose to cross-link at the longer wavelength to avoid unnecessary damage to the DNA and protein as well as to avoid non-8-bromoguanine-induced, nonspecific DNA cross-linking. Control experiments with 1 μm bovine serum albumin (Lanes 1 and 5) or no MutY (Lanes 2 and 6) did not show cross-linking nor did samples quenched prior to irradiation 2Additional controls not shown also showed that cross-linking to the single-stranded *bABT was not inhibited by the addition of non-8-bromoguanine-containing DNA, while the cross-linking of duplex tAAT:*bABT was inhibited by the addition of unlabeled bABT. These results show specific binding of the single-stranded bABT. (Lanes 3 and 7). UV cross-linking demonstrated direct contact between MutY and the 8-bromoguanine during catalysis. In a duplex DNA substrate where this base is hidden in the DNA helix, such contact could occur either from the insertion of a part of the enzyme into the helical space or by the extraction of the base from the helix into a binding pocket on the enzyme surface. Therefore, the observation of cross-linking with the duplex construct alone does not constitute compelling evidence of flipping of the 8-substituted guanine. However, the observation of cross-linking with the single-stranded DNA, where the rigid structural determinants of the duplex and the scissile adenine are absent, implies that the recognition of the 8-substituted guanine requires neither the prior binding of duplex DNA nor the extrusion of adenine. In addition, the increased cross-linking observed with single-stranded DNA suggests that the site of cross-linking on MutY is more readily accessible to a “free” 8-bromoguanine residue than one hidden within the helical space of duplex DNA. Conversely if contact were to occur with a protein side chain inserted into the DNA duplex to probe for the 8-substituted-guanine, then less cross-linking would be expected with the single-stranded construct where the “binding site” provided by the helical cage of the duplex is absent. 3While it is possible that the cross-linking with single-stranded *bABT could in principle have occurred via binding of the 8-bromoguanine by the adenine binding pocket, we consider this to be highly improbable due to the presence of six adenines and five guanines elsewhere in the sequence of bABT. Consequently these results support the hypothesis of a preexisting 8-oxoguanine binding pocket on the enzyme surface as proposed based on the structural homology to MutT (29Noll D.M. Gogos A. Granek J.A. Clarke N.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6374-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30House P.G. Volk D.E. Thiviyanathan V. Manuel R.C. Luxon B.A. Gorenstein D.G. Lloyd R.S. Prog.

To directly monitor the extrusion of 8-oxoguanine from the DNA duplex, we synthesized an 8-oxoguanine:adenine mismatched substrate with the fluorescent base analog 2-aminopurine (P), positioned 5′-adjacent to the 8-oxoguanine (O), tAAT:bPOT. The reduction of quantum yield of 2-aminopurine from base-stacking interactions (37Rachofsky E.L. Osman R. Ross J.B.

Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14075-14082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expected to observe an enhancement of the fluorescence intensity of the 2-aminopurine probe in response to the loss of base-stacking interaction upon extrahelical extrusion of its neighboring 8-oxoguanine. Similarly a homologous duplex substrate, tPAT:bAOT, with the 2-aminopurine probe adjacent to the scissile adenine was also synthesized to monitor adenine flipping. Single-turnover adenine excision assays at 500 nm MutY and 250 nm DNA showed identical time courses for the fluorophore-containing duplex substrates *tAAT:bPOT and *tPAT:bAOT and the non-fluorescent, normal substrate *tAAT:bAOT (Fig. 2). Nonlinear regression best fit of the data yielded a rate constant for excision for all three substrates at the active site of 0.25 ± 0.03 s−1 in agreement with reported values (26Porello S.L. Leyes A.E. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14756-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 29Noll D.M. Gogos A. Granek J.A. Clarke N.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6374-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), validating the suitability of these fluorescent duplexes as substrate analogs in quantitative kinetic measurements. Fig. 3a shows the real time fluorescence emission of the 2-aminopurine-containing tAAT:bPOT (250 nm) within 40 ms of mixing with 500 nm MutY in a stopped-flow fluorimeter. On this time scale, we observed a rapid, single-exponential increase in fluorescence with a rate constant of 108 ± 13 s−1. With the 2-aminopurine probe positioned next to the 8-oxoguanine, this experiment directly demonstrates 8-oxoguanine base flipping at 108 s−1 under these reaction conditions. In a similar experiment performed under identical conditions using a substrate where the fluorophore was positioned to monitor adenine flipping (tPAT:bAOT), the observed fluorescence enhancement appeared later, slower, and with multiple exponential phases. Fig. 3b shows split time-based stopped-flow traces for adenine flipping (top trace), 8-oxoguanine flipping (middle trace), and a negative control (bottom trace). The time course for tPAT:bAOT corresponding to adenine flipping occurred with an initial 30-ms lag followed by two distinct exponential increases. Comparison with the initial 30 ms of the tAAT:bPOT time course shows that the initial lag observed with adenine flipping coincided with 8-oxoguanine flipping, indicating that the extrusion of the adenine follows 8-oxoguanine flipping. The subsequent biphasic increase in fluorescence further reflects a two-step process for adenine extrusion with an initial extrusion of the adenine with an apparent rate constant of 16 ± 1.2 s−1 followed by a subsequent step at 1.9 s−1. In a negative control experiment using a duplex containing a non-cognate 8-oxoguanine:cytosine base pair, tACT:bPOT, no fluorescence change was detected (Fig. 3b, bottom trace). The large amplitude of the 1.9 s−1 exponential phase implicated a large favorable forward equilibrium for this step. However, an 8-fold smaller excision rate constant of 0.25 s−1 would rule out this step as being excision. In the paradigmatic base-flipping kinetic mechanism of the E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase, a conformational change step following base flipping corresponds structurally to the insertion of a leucine side chain of the enzyme into the DNA helix to occupy the space vacated by the extruded base (22Wong, I., Lundquist, A. J., Bernards, A. S., and Mosbaugh, D. W. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). The leucine insertion isomerization conferred additional stabilization for the “flipped-out” conformation of the extruded base by preventing its return into the DNA double helix. By analogy, the 1.9 s−1 exponential phase likely reflects a similar isomerization step in the reaction mechanism of MutY to facilitate the capture of the extruded adenine in preparation for excision. Identical rate constants were observed irrespective of the placement of the 2-aminopurine to detect 8-oxoguanine or adenine flipping consistent with the sequential three-step mechanism shown in Fig. 4: 8-oxoguanine extrusion (108 s−1), adenine flipping (16 s−1), and isomerization (1.9 s−1). Each step along this pathway thus provides incremental energetic stabilization toward the formation of the final doubly flipped conformation where the scissile adenine is captured by the active site of the enzyme. By requiring the 8-oxoguanine to be flipped before the adenine, the enzyme ensures that only those adenines mispaired to it are targeted for excision. Similarly the stabilization provided by the isomerization step following the extrusion of both bases of the mismatch ensures that only base pairs containing both 8-oxoguanine and adenine bases become captured with commitment toward catalysis. Accuracy in target selection is thereby achieved as each step of the mechanism functions to trigger the forward progress toward catalysis while coordinately stabilizing the previous steps. In addition, increased efficiency is achieved in searching for a scissile adenine. By sequentially coordinating the selection of the 8-oxoguanine and the adenine bases, the double base-flipping mechanism establishes a hierarchical order for the search process where the much rarer 8-oxoguanine constituent is first targeted. Interestingly the 8-oxoguanine of this mismatched base pair is readily discernable by the syn conformation of its glycosidic bond as illustrated in structural studies (42McAuley-Hecht K.E. Leonard G.A. Gibson N.J. Thomson J.B. Watson W.P. Hunter W.N. Brown T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10266-10270Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and biochemical evidence further suggests that MutY can recognize the syn conformation of the 8-oxoguanine base in this context (43Bulychev N.V. Varaprasad C.V. Dorman G. Miller J.H. Eisenberg M. Grollman A.P. Johnson F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13147-13156Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). MutY therefore likely takes advantage of this conformational feature in its scan along the DNA backbone to trigger the double base-flipping mechanism upon location of an 8-oxoguanine:adenine lesion. Such a hierarchically ordered search model would greatly enhance the efficacy of the search by mitigating the need to extrude and examine each individual base in the duplex DNA. The reaction rate constants reported here represent macroscopic rate constants observed at 250 nm DNA and 500 nmMutY. The resolution of the microscopic forward and reverse rate constants for each elementary step must await the completion of concentration dependence studies currently underway, although preliminary results suggest that the reaction conditions used were near saturation. However, the design and use of the 2-aminopurine-containing base-flipping-sensitive substrate pair tAAT:bPOT and tPAT:bAOT unambiguously demonstrates 8-oxoguanine flipping. In addition, by establishing the temporal sequence of the substrate recognition steps leading up to catalysis, we were able to observe the coordination of the mechanistic interplay between steps along the catalytic pathway responsible for substrate recognition. These stopped-flow studies not only provide direct kinetic detection of key structural intermediates, but more importantly, by placing these structures in their proper temporal order, they allow us to deduce the dynamic mechanistic basis by which this class of diverse DNA-metabolizing enzymes (13Lloyd R.S. Cheng X. Biopolymers. 1997; 44: 139-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recognizes and gains access to a naturally hidden target. We thank Jacqueline A.

Osteocalcin (OC), or bone gla protein, is a calcium-binding protein found in bone extracellular matrix and expressed by osteoblasts, odontoblasts, and hypertrophic chondrocytes (reviewed in Ref. 18Lian J.B.

It has an affinity for hydroxyapatite, suggesting a role in the regulation of mineralization. In fact, OC-null mutant mice exhibit increased bone density (19Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G.

Bone. 1998; 23: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the up-regulation of OC late in osteoblast differentiation is dependent upon collagen-integrin interaction. For example, the presence of AA dramatically increases the expression of OC and its promoter activity (21Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Conversely, incorporation of proline analogs, such as 3,4-dehydroproline (DHP), by osteoblasts, or the presence of α2 integrin blocking antibodies, prevents the induction of OC expression (14Xiao G.

Osteopontin (OPN) is a highly phosphorylated and glycosylated protein found in the extracellular matrix of mineralized tissues and in all body fluids (reviewed in Ref. 24Denhardt D.T. Noda M. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1998; 30–31: 92-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OPN interacts with a number of integrins, including αvβ1, αvβ3, αvβ5, α4β1, α8β1, and α9β1. Of these integrins, osteoblasts have been shown to express the αvβ1, αvβ3, αvβ5, α4β1, and α8β1integrins, at least in culture (15Hughes D.E. Salter D.M. Dedhar S. Simpson R. J. Bone Miner.

In fact, high levels of OPN are found in areas of bone remodeling (31Sodek J. Chen J. Nagata T. Kasugai S. Todescan R., Jr., Li, I.W. Kim R.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Collagenase-3 belongs to the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are responsible for degrading components of the extracellular matrix (reviewed in Ref. 37Woessner J.F.

In murine models, only collagenase-3 has been shown to play a significant role in bone. In skeletal tissue, matrix degradation by collagenase-3 has been associated with bone remodeling, endochondral bone formation, bone repair, and parathyroid hormone (PTH)-induced bone resorption (41Delaisse J.M.

Bone. 1999; 25: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The role of collagenases in bone degradation is further evidenced by the finding that homozygous mutation of the collagenase cleavage site in the Col1a1 gene in mutant mice results in diminished PTH-induced bone resorption, diminished PTH-induced calcemic responses, and thicker bones (46Zhao W. Byrne M.H. Boyce B.F. Krane S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Collagenase-3 is synthesized by a variety of cells, but in normal skeletal tissue it is expressed mainly by the matrix-forming cells, the osteoblasts and osteocytes in bone, and hypertrophic chondrocytes in cartilage (44Partridge N.C.

For example, PTH stimulates collagenase-3 gene expression in osteoblastic cells and requires the activator protein-1 (AP-1) and RD binding regions found just upstream of the collagenase-3 transcriptional start site (52Pendas A.M. Balbin M. Llano E. Jimenez M.G. Lopez-Otin C. Genomics. 1997; 40: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 53Selvamurugan N. Chou W.Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol.

Bloch S.R. Fiacco G.J. Partridge N.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 54Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Owen T.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3111-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) and is transcriptionally regulated during this process (6Winchester S.K. Bloch S.R. Fiacco G.J. Partridge N.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Given that collagenase-3 and OC are expressed during similar periods of osteoblast differentiation and that expression of both genes is regulated by RUNX2/Cbfa1, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that collagenase-3, like OC, is also regulated by integrin interaction with the extracellular matrix. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of collagenase-3 expression during osteoblast differentiation requires the presence of a collagenous matrix. Additionally, we demonstrate that collagenase-3 promoter activity is induced during osteoblastic differentiation and requires ascorbic acid supplementation. Finally, we provide evidence that demonstrates divergent regulation of collagenase-3 and OC by OPN and αv integrins. The 3,4-dehydroproline, β-gly, AA, mixed xylenes, n-butyryl coenzyme A, and normal mouse IgG control for OPN antibodies were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Type I collagen was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The AA-free α-MEM was obtained from Washington University Tissue Culture Center (St. Louis, MO). All other tissue culture media were obtained from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD). The αv integrin antagonist, RGD peptidomimetic compound (SC65811) was obtained from Searle & Co.

The constitutively active control plasmids pSV2 (CAT) and pGL3 (luciferase) and the inactive control plasmid, pSV0, were purchased from Promega Corp. The collagenase-3 probe is the rat cDNA from clone UMRCase54 in pBluescript, which has previously been described (38Quinn C.O. Scott D.K. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C.

For Northern experiments studying cell differentiation, cells were plated at a density of 6300 cells per cm2 in AA-free α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For transfection experiments, cells were plated at high density, 25,000 cells/cm2 in the same medium. Upon reaching confluency, the MC3T3-E1 cells were switched to AA-free α-MEM containing 10 mm β-gly and 50 μg/ml AA (mineralizing medium) where indicated. The medium was also supplemented with either 500 μm 3,4-dehydroproline (DHP), 6–24 μmintegrin blocking antibody, 0.1–10 μm RGD peptidomimetic (SC65811), or 240 nm recombinant OPN where indicated. Media changes were performed every 2 or 3 days. Collagen-coated plates were prepared by adding 1.6 ml of collagen solution (4.5 mg/ml), 0.2 ml of FBS, and 0.2 ml of 260 mm NaHCO3 into each well of a six-well plate and incubating for 1 h at room temperature. Cells and medium were then added, the cells were grown until the plates became confluent, and then cultured in mineralizing medium as described above. Total RNA was isolated from MC3T3-E1 cells at 1- and 2-week intervals following confluency. RNA (20 μg) was fractionated by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel in 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA running buffer. Gels were then blotted overnight to Zeta-Probe membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and UV cross-linked. Next, the filters were incubated for 1 h at 65 °C in prehybridization fluid (0.25 mNa2HPO4, pH 7.2 and 7% SDS). Fresh prehybridization fluid was then added along with 106 cpm/ml of random-primed [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe and incubated overnight at 65 °C. The following day, the filters were washed twice for 30–60 min each time with 40 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 5% SDS at 65 °C, and twice with 40 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 1% SDS at 65 °C for 30–60 min each time. Bound radiolabeled probe was then quantitated using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). All data were then expressed as the ratio of collagenase-3, osteocalcin, or osteopontin phosphorimaging units to LS2 (18 S ribosomal RNA) phosphorimaging units. MC3T3-E1 cells were transiently transfected with SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 1 μg of collagenase-3 reporter construct, 1 ng of pGL3 luciferase reporter DNA, and 10 μl of SuperFect were added to each well of near-confluent MC3T3-E1 cells in six-well plates. Three hours later, the medium was changed and the cells were cultured for 1 day (confluent cells) and then lysed, or grown in β-gly-supplemented or β-gly- and AA-supplemented medium for 5 days and then lysed and processed for CAT activity (5 days post-confluent cells). CAT assays were carried out by standard methods as previously described (60Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene. 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and lysed in 150 μl of 1× Reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Next, 50 μl of lysate was combined with 23 μm14C-labeled chloramphenicol (0.125 Ci/assay) and 250 μm n-butyryl coenzyme A. The reaction volume was adjusted to 100 μl with 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of mixed xylenes, and the butylated chloramphenicol in the aqueous phase was pre-extracted to a fresh tube. The xylene phase was back-extracted with 100 μl of 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the final butylated chloramphenicol was quantitated by scintillation counting. All samples were performed in triplicate and normalized to luciferase reporter activity. Luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Antibodies were prepared as described (61Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Briefly, intraperitoneal injections were first made into OPN knockout mice (29Rittling S.R. Matsumoto H.N. McKee M.D. Nanci A., An, X.R. Novick K.E. Kowalski A.J. Noda M. Denhardt D.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Approximately 20 μg of recombinant histidine-tagged human (or mouse) OPN (prepared in Escherichia coli and purified on a nickel column) in 250 μl of PBS mixed with 250 μl of Freund's complete adjuvant was injected intraperitoneally. After 2 and 5 weeks, the mice were boosted with an equal amount of protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Three weeks later (week 8) the mice were given a final boost 3 days prior to sacrifice and splenectomy. Spleen cells were fused to SP2/0 cells and selected with hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine medium. Positive clones were then selected via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blots and cloned to single cells with two rounds of limiting dilution cloning. Monoclonal antibodies were produced from hybridomas grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1× hypoxanthine/thymidine, 10% FBS, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. The tissue culture media were collected after incubating the hybridomas for 2 weeks to ensure that the majority of cells had died. The cells were pelleted, and the medium was then applied to an OPN affinity column (GST-fused OPN coupled to Sepharose). Antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, 0.5m NaCl, pH 2.7, and immediately neutralized with Tris-HCl to pH 7.0–7.5. The 2A1 and 2C5 antibodies were raised against mouse OPN, whereas 1G4 was raised against human OPN. The data in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, 6, and 7 are expressed as means ± S.E. of three separate samples. The statistical significance was determined by Student's t test and single factor analysis of variance. Data shown in Figs. 5 and 8 are representative of three separate experiments with similar results.Figure 2Collagenase-3 expression in differentiating MC3T3-E1 cells is inhibited by β-gly.MC3T3-E1 cells were grown to confluence, switched to AA-free α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 μg/ml AA, and cultured for 1 week in the absence (AA) or presence (+β-gly) of 10 mm β-gly.

We used a genetic selection based on the yeast two-hybrid assay to identify nine cheW point mutations that specifically disrupted CheW interaction with CheA but not with Tar. We sequenced these single point mutants and purified four of the mutant CheW proteins for detailed biochemical characterizations that demonstrated the weakened affinity of the mutant CheW proteins for CheA, but not for Tar. In the three-dimensional structure of CheW, the positions affected by these mutations cluster on one face of the protein, defining a potential binding interface for interaction of CheW with CheA. We used a similar two-hybrid approach to identify four mutation sites that disrupted CheW binding to Tar. Mapping of these “Tar-sensitive” mutation sites and those from previous suppressor analysis onto the structure of CheW defined an extended surface on a face of the protein that is adjacent to the CheA-binding surface and that may serve as an interface for CheW binding to Tar.

Binding of repellent stimuli to MCPs is thought to stimulate CheA autokinase activity, whereas attractant stimuli inhibit this activity (7Mutoh N. Oosawa K. Simon M.I. J.

Understanding how this complex forms and how it mediates CheA regulation are, therefore, central to defining the molecular mechanisms of both excitation and adaptation in the chemotaxis system. Although many components of the bacterial chemotaxis system have been studied in considerable detail (for reviews, see Refs.5Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about the specific biochemical contributions of CheW. This 167-amino acid protein (7Mutoh N. Oosawa K. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 992-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) does not appear to have any enzymatic activity by itself; nor does it share sequence or structural similarities with motifs that do have catalytic activities. But CheW clearly plays a crucial role in the bacterial chemotaxis system, as indicated by the complete inability of cheWmutants to respond to any chemotactic stimuli (25Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 45-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We are attempting to define how CheW contributes to chemotaxis signal transduction. CheW has four known activities in vitro: (i) binding to CheA; (ii) binding to MCPs, such as Tar; (iii) promoting formation of CheA·CheW·MCP ternary complexes; and (iv) enabling MCPs to stimulate and/or inhibit CheA autokinase activity (9Borkovich K.A.

A. 1991; 88: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, current models depict CheW as an “adapter protein” that serves to tether CheA to the MCPs (18Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20Schuster S.C. Swanson R.V. Alex L.A. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 792-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). While such a simple adapter role would account for the knownin vitro activities of CheW, it is important to emphasize that the relationships among these in vitro activities and their roles in vivo have not been clearly established. In particular, the functional importance of CheW's binding activities has not been clearly established by, for example, determining whether disrupting the CheW ↔ CheA binding interaction affects formation of the CheA·CheW·MCP ternary complex and/or activation of CheA within this complex. In previous work (29Boukhvalova, M., Dahlquist, F. W., and Stewart, R. C. (March 28, 2002) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M110908200Google Scholar), we followed a traditional mutational approach in an attempt to investigate the functional significance of CheW binding interactions with CheA and MCPs: we identified mutations that disrupted CheW's ability to support chemotaxis, and then we examined the effect of these mutations on the ability of the protein to bind to CheA and Tar. Each of the mutants we isolated following this approach was defective in formation of an activated ternary complex and exhibited defects in both binding interactions. While those results suggested that CheW's binding activities are indeed important for its role in chemotaxis signal transduction, they did not allow us to examine the effects of eliminating just one binding interaction at a time; nor did they allow us to identify what segments of CheW might be involved specifically in interactions with CheA and which with MCPs. To examine more rigorously the role(s) of CheW's binding activities and to begin defining potential interaction interfaces with CheA and Tar, we turned to the DITA approach of Inouye et al. (30Inouye C. Dhillon N. Durfee T. Zambryski P.C. Thorner J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 479-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the goal of identifying CheW mutants lacking just one of the two binding activities. Our results, in conjunction with the recently solved three-dimensional structure of CheW (31Griswold I.J. Zhou H. Matison M. Swanson R.V. McIntosh L.P. Simon M.I. Dahlquist F.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), indicate clustering of mutation sites that cause disruption of CheW ↔ CheA interactions and therefore suggest the location of a possible CheA binding interface on CheW. In addition, our results help to further elucidate the CheW surface that appears to mediate contacts with MCPs, first defined by the genetic suppressor studies of Liu and Parkinson (26Liu J. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4941-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5-Fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.

Dahlquist (University of Oregon), respectively. Strain D392 was used for swarm assays, whereas strain RP3098, lacking all chemotaxis genes, was used for purification of most of the proteins used in this study. Plasmid pGAD:CheW encoded a CheW-Gal4AD fusion and was created using vector pGAD424 (CLONTECH). Wild typecheW was PCR-amplified from pCW (27Gegner J.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) using primers that generated EcoRI and SalI sites upstream and downstream, respectively, of cheW. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI and then ligated into corresponding sites of pGAD424. Plasmid pLex:cTar encoding cTar-LexA fusion was created by ligating a fragment oftar encoding amino acids 257–553 into EcoRI andBamHI sites of plasmid pLex202PL. Plasmid pGBT9:CheA encoding CheA-Gal4BD fusion was created by inserting full-lengthcheA into vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH, Inc.) between SmaI and SalI sites. The plasmid pCE (29Boukhvalova, M., Dahlquist, F. W., and Stewart, R. C. (March 28, 2002) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M110908200Google Scholar) was used for overexpression and purification of CheW mutant proteins carrying a Met-His6-Cys extension at their N-terminal ends. Mutant cheW alleles were excised from corresponding pGAD:CheW plasmids and ligated into pCE usingEcoRI and SalI sites. For use in the swarm assays, mutant cheW alleles were excised from pGAD:CheW vectors using AgeI and SalI and ligated into corresponding sites of pCnoW (29Boukhvalova, M., Dahlquist, F. W., and Stewart, R. C. (March 28, 2002) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M110908200Google Scholar). All plasmids created in the course of this work were verified by dideoxy sequencing (performed at the University of Maryland Center for Agricultural Biotechnology). Random cheW mutants were generated using an error-prone PCR procedure in which an unequal ratio of dNTPs and a high concentration of Mn2+ created conditions favorable for nucleotide misincorporation by Taqpolymerase (40Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique (Phila.). 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar). The PCR-generated, mutagenized cheW DNA fragment was gel-purified and then transformed along withEcoRI/SalI-digested pGAD424 into YCJ4 strain carrying pGBT9:CheA and pLex:cTar (30Inouye C. Dhillon N. Durfee T. Zambryski P.C. Thorner J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 479-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pGAD:CheW plasmid was restoredin vivo in the resulting YCJ4 transformants by a gap repair mechanism (41Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Half of the transformation mixture was plated on Yc medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine (Yc−his,trp,leu) (selecting for pLex:cTar, pGBT9:CheA, and pGAD:CheW, respectively) and including 5-FOA. Colonies capable of growth in the presence of 5-FOA were transferred to Yc-his,trp,leu plates lacking uracil, and the results of growth on these plates were evaluated after 3 days at 30 °C. The colonies that displayed a URA−phenotype were then restreaked on Yc-his,trp,leu plates; after a 2-day incubation at 30 °C, these colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity using a colony lift assay (42Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The second half of the transformation mixture was plated on Yc-his,trp,leu medium in which the amount of uracil was reduced from the normal level of 0.01 to 0.0008%; this selected for URA+ colonies (attempts to use medium completely lacking uracil were unsuccessful). Among the mutants growing on this type of medium, we then identified β-Gal− colonies as described above. pGAD:CheW from selected colonies was then isolated and retransformed into YCJ4 strain expressing cTar and CheA fusions. The resulting transformants were assayed for URA3 andlacZ expression to confirm the phenotype of the strains observed in the differential interaction trap assay. Nucleotide changes in these alleles were determined by dideoxy sequencing at the University of Maryland. These assays utilized wild-type and mutant CheW proteins that had been engineered to include an N-terminal His6-Cys tag, as described previously (29Boukhvalova, M., Dahlquist, F. W., and Stewart, R. C. (March 28, 2002) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M110908200Google Scholar). The purified His6-Cys-CheW proteins were modified by covalently attaching fluorescein maleimide (Molecular Probes) to the single cysteine side chain. Fluorescently labeled His6-Cys-CheW (hereafter referred to as F*-CheW) was then used for binding assays. Binding of wild-type or mutant F*-CheW to CheA was monitored using fluorescence anisotropy as described previously (29Boukhvalova, M., Dahlquist, F. W., and Stewart, R. C. (March 28, 2002) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M110908200Google Scholar). In short, these assays involved measuring the increase in fluorescence anisotropy (λex = 492 nm, λem= 517 nm) of the F*-CheW sample as increasing concentrations of CheA were added. These experiments were performed in TEND buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 10% polyethylene glycol 12,000. For each CheW variant, the magnitude of the observed anisotropy increase as a function of the CheA concentration was used to generate a binding isotherm that was fitted to a simple binding equation to generate an estimate ofK d CheA, the dissociation constant for the F*-CheW·CheA complex. Details of this assay and analysis procedure have been published previously (29Boukhvalova, M., Dahlquist, F. W., and Stewart, R. C. (March 28, 2002) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M110908200Google Scholar). Assays of the binding of wild-type or mutant CheWs to Tar were performed using the “pull-down competition” approach detailed previously (29Boukhvalova, M., Dahlquist, F. W., and Stewart, R. C. (March 28, 2002) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M110908200Google Scholar). These assays made use of inner membrane vesicles carrying overproduced levels of Tar (18Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Such vesicles are easily pelleted by centrifugation and carry with them, into the pellet, F*-CheW in the expected amounts based on CheW binding to Tar. To assess binding of mutant CheW proteins binding to Tar, competition experiments were performed in which wild-type F*-CheW (final concentration 2 μm) was premixed with a particular CheW mutant protein (0–50 μm). Then the inner membrane vesicles were added to this mixture, generating a final Tar concentration of 11 μm in TEND buffer containing 1 mg ml−1 BSA. The resulting protein mixtures were allowed to equilibrate (in the dark, with gentle mixing) for 10 min at 25 °C, and then the vesicles (and associated F*-CheW) were sedimented by centrifugation. The fluorescence emission intensity of the supernatants of these centrifuged samples were then measured (λex 492 nm, λem 517 nm). The data generated in these experiments showed the expected progressive increase in signal intensity (reflecting increasing levels of free F*-CheW) at increasing concentrations of competitor (unlabeled, mutant CheW). Analyses of these titration curves allowed us to define the K d of the complex formed by Tar with the mutant CheW (29Boukhvalova, M., Dahlquist, F. W., and Stewart, R. C. (March 28, 2002) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M110908200Google Scholar). We used the DITA of Inouye et al. (30Inouye C. Dhillon N. Durfee T. Zambryski P.C. Thorner J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 479-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to quickly and easily observe CheW interactions with CheA and Tar. This approach is a three-hybrid modification of the yeast two-hybrid assay (43Fields S. Song O.-k. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar), and it involved simultaneous expression of three chimeric proteins, carried by three distinct plasmids, in S. cerevisiae strain YCJ4. The three chimeric fusions were as follows: CheW fused to the transcription activation domain of Gal4 (CheW-Gal4AD); CheA fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (CheA-Gal4BD); and the cytoplasmic domain of Tar (amino acids 257–553) fused to the DNA-binding protein LexA (cTar-LexA). As depicted in Fig. 1, interaction of CheW-Gal4AD with CheA-Gal4BD is expected to result in expression of theURA3 reporter gene in YCJ4, and interaction of CheW-Gal4AD with cTar-LexA is expected to drive expression of the lacZreporter gene in this yeast strain. Our goal was to use this system to identify two distinct classes of cheW mutations: (i) those that diminished CheW binding to CheA, but not to Tar and (ii) those that decreased the affinity of CheW for Tar but not for CheA. Before proceeding with such a mutant search, we first examined the specificity and sensitivity of the DITA two-hybrid interactions. As expected, YCJ4 cells expressing CheW-Gal4AD, CheA-Gal4BD, and cTar-LexA were Ura+ (5-FOA sensitive) and β-Gal+. The following controls were performed: YCJ4 cells expressing just CheA-Gal4AD and cTar-LexA (but not CheW-Gal4AD) were Ura−, 5-FOA-resistant, and β-Gal−; YCJ4 cells expressing just CheW-Gal4AD and CheA-Gal4BD (but not cTar-LexA) were Ura+, 5-FOA-sensitive, and β-Gal−; and YCJ4 cells expressing just CheW-Gal4AD and cTar-LexA (but not CheA-Gal4BD) were Ura−, 5-FOA-resistant, and β-Gal+. We performed several additional control experiments to assess the specificity of the apparent interactions of CheW with CheA and Tar. In these, we detected no observable interaction between CheW-Gal4AD and bicoid-LexA or Snf1-Gal4BD (30Inouye C. Dhillon N. Durfee T. Zambryski P.C. Thorner J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 479-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicated that the DITA can be used to accurately monitor CheW ↔ CheA and CheW ↔ Tar binding interactions independently in the same cell. To assess the sensitivity of the DITA in our system, we evaluated the effects of six cheW mutations that we had previously shown to cause moderate to severe decreases in the affinity of CheW for CheA and Tar (29Boukhvalova, M., Dahlquist, F.

Our results (Table I) indicate that expression of the URA3 reporter gene is sensitive to moderate (and large) changes ofK d CheA but not to small affinity changes: a 6.5-fold increase in K d CheAgave rise to a Ura− phenotype, but a 3.3-fold increase did not. We observed somewhat greater sensitivity for altered expression of the lacZ reporter gene in response to changes in the affinity of CheW for Tar; a 3-fold increase inK d Tar was sufficient to generate a β-Gal− phenotype.Table IPhenotypes of previously identified CheW mutant proteins in the differential interaction trap assay and their affinities for CheA and TarCheW variant K d CheA K d Tar URA3expression1-aURA3 expression was assessed as growth on selective medium lacking uracil. +, growth after 3 days of incubation at 30°C; −, absence of growth under such conditions. lacZ expression1-blacZ expression was assessed by a colony lift assay of β-galactosidase activity (42): +, production of blue color when permeabilized cells were exposed to 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal); −, the absence of color change; −/+, a faint blue color was observed in half of the assays performed with this mutant (the total number of trials was 4). μM μMWild type6.0 ± 0.211.0 ± 0.5++G57D>13033 ± 6−−V36M47 ± 2>230−−G133E75 ± 545 ± 6−−154ocr43 ± 43.6 ± 0.2−+R62H14.7 ± 0.523 ± 4+−/+G41D20 ± 137 ± 3+−Affinities were determined using fluorescence anisotropy (to defineK d CheA) and competition pull-down assays (to define K d Tar) as detailed by Boukhvalova et al.

In their Policy Forum, [Coombs and Georghiou][1] argue that centralized solutions have been replaced by a new ecology where large firms are complemented by small technology-rich firms. Outsourcing, globalization, and technological alliances are of growing importance. Within firms, there are new ways to organize radical research, based on a small number of focused programs with ambitious targets aimed at new businesses and shared between corporate research and businesses. These are supported by new ways to link to universities based on long-term and broad scope relationships with top departments. To sustain the growth of industrial R&D, public funding of university research should keep pace.

The C-terminal end of γ forms an α-helix which properly fits into the “hydrophobic bearing” provided by loops of subunits α and β. This “bearing” is expected to be essential for the rotary function. We checked the importance of this contact region by successive C-terminal deletions of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 amino acid residues (Escherichia coliF1-ATPase). The ATP hydrolysis activity of a load-freeensemble of F1 with 12 residues deleted decreased to 24% of the control. EF1 with deletions of 15 or 18 residues was inactive, probably because it failed to assemble. The average torque generated by a single molecule of EF1 when loaded by a fluorescent actin filament was, however, unaffected by deletions of up to 12 residues, as was their rotational behavior (all samples rotated during 60 ± 19% of the observation time). Activation energy analysis with the ensemble revealed a moderate decrease from 54 kJ/mol for EF1(full-length γ) to 34 kJ/mol for EF1(γ-12). These observations imply that the intactness of the C terminus of subunit γ provides structural stability and/or routing during assembly of the enzyme, but that it is not required for the rotary action under load, proper.

It is synthesized in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells by F0F1-ATP synthase (cf. Refs. 1Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 2Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Stock D.

The enzyme works like a (reversible) rotary molecular machine with two motors/generators mounted on a common shaft and hold together by an eccentric stator (7Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y.

Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In ATP synthesis mode the F0 part translocates protons, thereby converting protonmotive force into the mechanical energy of rotary motion. Rotation is forwarded through the shaft into the F1 part where it drives ATP synthesis. In ATP hydrolysis mode the rotation is reversed, and ions are pumped through F0 in the opposite direction. The Escherichia coli enzyme (EF1),1 has the simplest subunit composition. It consists of eight different subunits, five in the peripheral F1 portion and three in the membrane-intrinsic F0, with stoichiometries of (αβ)3γδε for F1 and probablyab 2 c 10 for F0(12Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In view of the rotary mechanism they also can be organized into “rotor” (γεc) and “stator” (αβδab). According to the crystal structure of bovine heart mitochondrial F1 (13Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar) the C-terminal region of subunit γ properly fits into a supposed “hydrophobic bearing” formed by loops in the upper portion of the hexagon of subunits (αβ)3. Multiple sequence alignments showed that this region of γ is more conserved than the remainder (14Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Iwamoto A. Miki J. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5043-5048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One would expect therefore that truncations, point mutations, and covalent cross-links between the “bearing” and the rotor should inhibit the activity. But this expectation was not always met. 1) EF1with truncated γ (lacking 10 C-terminal residues) was still active (15Iwamoto A. Miki J. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5043-5048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2) The ATPase activity of the homologous enzyme from chloroplasts (CF1) tolerated truncations of γ up to 20 C-terminal deletions, 10–16 residue truncations even resulted in activation of the ATP hydrolysis activity (16Sokolov M., Lu, L. Tucker W. Gao F. Gegenheimer P.A. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13824-13829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 3) Point mutations in the C-terminal region of E. coli γ were tolerated in many cases, including some that changed polar residues into hydrophobic ones or even caused a charge reversal (15Iwamoto A. Miki J. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5043-5048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4) A number of second site mutations were identified within the region of residues 269–280 inE. coli γ, which restored energy coupling (17Nakamoto R.K. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 867-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the significantly impaired mutants γM23R or γM23K. These constructs, however, were not able to build up protonmotive force to the extent of wild type enzyme despite comparable levels of ATPase activity (18Shin K. Nakamoto R.K. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20835-20839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and despite generation of the same apparent torque (19Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7780-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These restoring second site point mutations often resulted from the substitution of bulky residues with smaller ones, but in one case Ala was substituted with Val, thus increasing the occupied volume of the side chain significantly (17Nakamoto R.K. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 867-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, segments were identified in γ by suppressor mutagenesis and second site mutagenesis, which are separated in the three-dimensional structure but still restored energy coupling if combined (20Nakamoto R.K., Al- Shawi M.K. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14042-14046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 5) The effects of a deleterious frameshift inE. coli γ could be mended by point mutations in subunit β, at quite a distance from the frameshift region within γ (Thr277–Val286 (21Jeanteurdebeukelaer C. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22850-22854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)). 6) Most surprisingly, a covalent link between the penultimate C-terminal residue of EF1-γ and a nearby residue of α (γA285C ↔ αP280C (22Gumbiowski K. Cherepanov D. Müller M. Pänke O. Promto P. Winkler S. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42287-42292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) neither inhibited ATP hydrolysis nor the rotation of subunit γ relative to (αβ)3 and the torque generation under load. It would appear that the C-terminal part of γ does play an important role in ATP synthase, but according to the foregoing not to the extent of certain residues being absolutely required. The situation is reminiscent of the “DELSEED” sequence in subunit β, which, despite conservation among many species, still tolerated not only one single point mutation (7Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) but even complete substitution of the acidic residues by alanines (23Hara K.Y. Noji H. Bald D. Yasuda R. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14260-14263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The pronounced interplay of the rotor subunit γ with its partners α and β is underlined by the fact that revertants map to distant regions not only located on the defective γ itself, but also on β. In the above cited work with truncated subunit γ the activity of the enzyme constructs has been measured by ATP hydrolysis assay with isolated and solubilized F1. Since a mechanical load is absent under these conditions, the F1-ATPase operates under kinetic control. In the holoenzyme, F0F1, on the other hand, F1 works against the ion-driven F0 motor. Likewise, in the micro-videographic rotation assay (10Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar) F1 works against the (viscous) drag of an actin filament of micrometer length. Under both conditions the enzyme is mechanically strained, and turnover is greatly slowed down or even stalled (thermodynamic control). It has been an interesting question whether F1 constructs with truncated γ are still able to operate in the rotation assay, where mechanical strain might cause the rotor to get jammed in the bearing. This prompted us to examine the functional importance of the C-terminal end of E. colisubunit γ. We deleted 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 amino acid residues from its C terminus (Fig. 1) and determined the rotation and the torque generated by these truncated mutants. We also assayed the ATPase activity, however, with emphasis on the Arrhenius activation energy. The results show that up to 12 C-terminal amino acid residues of subunit γ are not required for the rotary function of the enzyme. During rotation phases of the loaded enzyme the torque remained the same as in controls. In the freely running enzyme, however, the activation energy of the truncated constructs decreased from 54 to 34 kJ/mol, as if the activation barrier was determined by a mechanical constraint that was lessened by truncation. Although there was little effect on the functioning of assembled enzyme molecules, their structural stability was affected by the truncation of γ, and the removal of 15 or 18 amino acids probably prevented assembly altogether. All enzymes were obtained either from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt/Main, Germany), MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany) or Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany). Oligonucleotide primers were custom-synthesized by MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Biotin-PEAC5-maleimide (Dojindo, Japan) was obtained via the German representative Gerbu Biotechnik, Gaiberg, Germany. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) superflow and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). All other reagents used were of the highest grade available commercially. Starting with plasmid pKH7 (all wild type cysteines substituted by Ala (24Kuo P.H. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), His6-tag extension at the N terminus of subunit β, γK109C (25Noji H. Häsler K. Junge W. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Engelbrecht S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)) plasmid pMM4 was generated by transferring the KpnI/SacI fragment of pKH7 (containing the entire coding region of uncG and part of the sequence of uncD (Ala1–Leu162) into pBluescript II SK +/−. Based upon a method described by Weineret al. (26Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), deletions were introduced in uncG by PCR with the following 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides as 3′-5′-primers: 5′-P-GGCCCCCGAGACGATCTCGGTGAGTTCCTG-3′, 5′-P-GACGATCTCGGTGAGTTCCTGAGTAATGCTGG-3′, 5′-P-GGTGAGTTCCTGAGTAATGCTGGCCTGACG-3′, 5′-P-CTGAGTAATGCTGGCCTGACGAGCTTTGTTG-3′, 5′-P-GCTGGCCTGACGAGCTTTGTTGTATACC-3′, 5′-P-ACGAGCTTTGTTGTATACCAACTGCAGCTC-3′, and as 5′-3′-primer the 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotide 5′-P-TAAACAGGTTATTTCGTAGAGGATTTAATATGAG-3′ (Fig. 2). pMM4 was used as PCR template in all cases. KpnI/SacI fragments of pMM4 subclones containing the uncG deletions were thereafter reintroduced into pKH7 yielding the following plasmids: pMM16 (γΔAla284–Val286, “γ-3”), pMM20 (γΔSer281–Val286, “γ-6”), pMM17 (γΔGlu278–Val286, “γ-9”), pMM8 (γΔGlu275–Val286, “γ-12”), pMM18 (γΔIle272–Val286, “γ-15”), and pMM19 (γΔGln269–Val286, “γ-18”). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing (27Applied Biosystems ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kits, Original and Version 2.0 Ed. Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA2000Google Scholar). The resultant plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain DK8 (28Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains an uncB-uncC deletion and hence has lost the ability to functionally express F0F1-ATPase. The mutants were tested for expression of a functional ATP synthase by growth on solid succinate medium (34 mm KH2PO4, 64 mm K2HPO4, 0.3 mmMgSO4, 20 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1 μmFeSO4, 1 μm ZnCl2, 10 μm CaCl2, 50 μg/ml each ofl-isoleucine, l-asparagine,l-valine, and thymine, 2 μg/ml thiamine, 0.4% (w/v) sodium succinate, and 3% (w/v) agar). Transformed strains were grown in glycerol-containing minimal medium (34 mm KH2PO4, 64 mmK2HPO4, 0.3 mm MgSO4,20 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 μm FeSO4, 1 μmZnCl2, 10 μm CaCl2, 50 μg/ml each of l-isoleucine, l-asparagine,l-valine, and thymine, 2 μg/ml thiamine, and 0.5% (v/v) glycerol). Before inoculation ampicillin was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Cells were harvested atA 600 = 0.8. Membrane preparation and EF1 isolation were carried out essentially as described previously (29Wise J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10403-10409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were not treated with phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride and pancreatic DNase before the Ribi press passage. Instead the buffer for resuspension of the cells after harvesting was supplemented with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany, 1 tablet/100 ml). The crude supernatant of the final wash step (containing the F1-ATPase) was applied to an anion exchange column (Tosoh Fractogel TSK-DEAE 650(S), Toyo Soda, Darmstadt, Germany) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris/H2SO4, 10% (v/v) methanole, pH 7.8). Using a stepwise salt elution by addition of buffer B (buffer A + 0.5 m Na2SO4), EF1 was eluted in the 75–150 mmNa2SO4 fraction (10–20 mg of protein/12 liters of culture volume). After addition of 1 mm MgATP the protein was precipitated with 3.2 m(NH4)2SO4 and stored at 4 °C. 2–3 mg protein were purified from the (NH4)2SO4 precipitate by gel filtration through NAP-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany), which were equilibrated with 20 mmMOPS-KOH, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.0 (buffer C). After determination of the protein concentration the 20-fold molar excess of Biotin-PEAC5-maleimide was added, and the samples were incubated 15–20 min at room temperature. The protein was then subjected to Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. After equilibration with buffer C the biotinylated EF1 was eluted with buffer C containing 150 mm imidazole yielding typically 250 μg of protein/500 μl. For the rotation experiments flow cells were constructed of two coverslips (bottom 26 × 76 mm, top 21 × 26 mm, thickness 0.15 mm (Menzel-Gläser/ProLabor, Georgsmarienhütte, Germany), which were separated by parafilm strips. Protein solutions were infused in the following order (2 × 25 μl per step, 4-min incubation): 1) 0.8 μmNi-NTA-horseradish peroxidase conjugate in 20 mm Mops/KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2(buffer C); 2) 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumine in buffer C, (buffer D); 3) 5–10 nm EF1 in buffer D; 4) wash with buffer D; 5) 0.5 μm streptavidin in buffer D; 6) wash with buffer D; 7) 200 nm biotinylated, fluorescently labeled F-actin (30Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) in buffer D (7 min incubation); 8) wash with buffer D; 9) 20 mm glucose, 0.2 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 50 μg/ml catalase, 5 mm ATP in buffer D (aiming at the torque generated by the mutant enzyme with truncated γ this high concentration was chosen to bypass occasional lack of substrate). Rotating filaments were observed with an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX70, Olympus, Japan; lens PlanApo 100×/1.40 oil, fluorescence cube MWIG) and recorded with a VHS-PAL video recorder at 25 frames/s. The search for rotating filaments was carried out for 30 min per flow cell. Video data were captured (frame grabber FlashBus, Integral Technologies), and filament length as well as rotation velocity were analyzed with ImageProPlus 4.0 (Media Cybernetics). Deliberate omission of either one single component of the required components (Ni-NTA-horseradish peroxidase-biotinylated EF1-streptavidin-biotin-F-actin) prevented the binding of fluorescent F-actin, as evident from the absence of fluorescent filaments within in the flow cell. This ensured that the actin filaments were attached specifically to subunit γ. Samples for Arrhenius analyses were prepared just as the samples for the rotation assay, except that they were not biotinylated. After Ni-NTA affinity chromatography 1 mm MgATP was added to the eluate. ATP hydrolysis activity was measured spectrophotometrically in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system essentially according to Ref. 31Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22292-22297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar. The reaction mixture contained 25 mm Tris/HCl, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCN, 2 mm phoshoenolpyruvate, 5 mm ATP, 0.35 mm β-NADH, 30 units/mll-lactate-dehydrogenase, and 30 units/ml pyruvate kinase, pH 7.5. 1 ml of the reaction mixture was preincubated 10 min at the desired temperature, then the reaction was started by addition of 1 μg of EF1. The decrease of NADH absorption at 340 nm was recorded for 5–30 min. Polyacryamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS was carried out in the Amersham Biosciences Phast system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (32Downer N.W. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2930-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and quantified using ImageProPlus 4.0 (Media Cybernetics). Protein determinations were performed according to Sedmak and Grossberg (33Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 79: 544-552Crossref Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). Aiming at the function of the C terminus of ATP synthase subunit γ, we constructed six mutants of E. coli F0F1-ATPase containing C-terminally truncated γ subunits (γ-3, -6, -9, -12, -15, and -18) by substitution of the KpnI/SacI-fragment of pKH7 (carrying the entire coding sequence for subunit γ (25Noji H. Häsler K. Junge W. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Engelbrecht S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)) with the corresponding fragments of mutated subclones (cf. Fig.2). The resulting plasmids, pMM16 (γ-3), pMM20 (γ-6), pMM17 (γ-9), pMM8 (γ-12), pMM18 (γ-15) and pMM19 (γ-18), were transformed into E. coli DK8 (28Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and tested for growth on succinate (TableI). It would seem that in all cases, except for EF1(γ-15) and EF1(γ-18), the complexes were assembled but that they became increasingly unstable. A slight increase of the doubling times (EF1-KH7 (control) → EF1(γ-12)) paralleled a decrease of the F1-ATPase activities of solubilized EF1(γ-x). Prolonged doubling times of EF1(γ-15) and EF1(γ-18) as well as the failure of the respective mutants to grow on succinate suggested that these strains were not able at all to assemble functional EF0EF1. These cells had to rely on glycolysis for the synthesis of ATP, just as E. coli strain DK8 without any plasmid. In comparison with EF1(γ-15) and EF1(γ-18) the significantly smaller doubling time ofE. coli DK8 might be explained by the complete lack of plasmids and therefore a less demanding nucleotide metabolism.Table IGrowth, doubling times, yields, ATPase activities, and activation energies of EF 1 -KH 7 and EF 1 (γ-x) E. coli DK8 complemented with the indicated plasmidGrowth at 37 °C on solid succinate mediumDoubling times at 37 °C in glycerol-containing minimal mediumEF1 yield per liter glycerol-containing minimal mediumHydrolysis activity of F1 at 35 °C, pH 8Activation energy (E a) at 30 °C min mg/liter units/mg kJ/mol139pKH7 (control)+139 ± 61.5 ± 0.393 ± 854 ± 8pMM16 (γ-3)+145 ± 111.565 ± 641 ± 6pMM20 (γ-6)+153 ± 81.246 ± 436 ± 5pMM17 (γ-9)+156 ± 41.228 ± 235 ± 5pMM8 (γ-12)+157 ± 100.8 ± 0.222 ± 234 ± 5pMM18 (γ-15)202pMM19 (γ-18)230Strains were spread on medium with succinate as sole carbon source and incubated three days at 37 °C.

The activation energies for EF1-KH7 and EF1(γ-x) were calculated from the slopes of the plots shown in Fig. 6 for the range between 20 and 35 °C. The assumption that EF1(γ-15) and EF1(γ-18) did not assemble was supported by the failure to isolate measurable amounts of F-ATPase. On the other hand, the yields of truncation mutants up to “γ-12” and the control were comparable. The purity of the resulting EF1 preparations was checked by SDS-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.3). It was evident that all EF1 preparations had the same α:β:γ ratio. The ATP hydrolysis activities of the purified EF1(γ-x) at 35 °C decreased with increasing deletion length (Table I). EF1(γ-3) showed 70%, EF1(γ-6) 50%, EF1(γ-9) 30%, and EF1(γ-12) 24% of the hydrolysis activity of the control (EF1-KH7). These results were consistent with those previously reported by Iwamoto et al. (15Iwamoto A. Miki J. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5043-5048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who found 63 and 14% of the membraneATPase activity of a control at 37 °C for EF1(γ-4) and EF1(γ-10), respectively. EF1(γ-18) in their hands also was not capable of growing by oxidative phosphorylation (15Iwamoto A. Miki J. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5043-5048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of C-terminal truncations of γ on the torque (Fig. 4) were investigated by measuring the rotational velocities of an attached actin filament (10Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar) dependent on its length. It is noteworthy that the probability to find rotating filaments decreased proportionally with the truncation length: Within 30 min around 36 rotating filaments were observed with EF1-KH7, 15 with EF1(γ-3), 6 with EF1(γ-6), 2 with EF1(γ-9), and just 1 with EF1(γ-12). The apparent torque generated by single enzyme molecules was calculated according to Refs. 10Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K.

Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar using the following equation (see Ref. 35Hunt A.J. Gittes F. Howard J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 766-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar),T=4π32πνηL3lnLr−0.447Equation 1 where T denotes the torque, ν the rotational rate,η the viscosity of the ambient medium, L the filament length, and r the radius of the actin filament (2.8 nm). The assumption in the cited work that the rotating filament operated against the viscous drag of the bulk medium as determined by the viscosity of bulk water, namely η(H2O) = 10−3 kg m−1 s−1, is questionable. We have previously scrutinized this notion by gauging the torque by the filament's curvature, as with a spring balance (36Cherepanov D.A. Junge W. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1234-1244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Pänke O. Cherepanov D.A. Gumbiowski K. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1220-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The result, a value of about 50 pN nm, has been 2–3-fold larger than inferred from measurements of the rotation velocity in the same assay (see Table I in Ref. 37Pänke O. Cherepanov D.A. Gumbiowski K. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1220-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). One reason for this higher torque is that the viscosity at the surface is higher than in the bulk due to the immediate vicinity of filament and surface (38Happel J. Brenner H. Low Reynolds Number Hydrodynamics. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, the Hague1983Google Scholar). It is important to note that the high torque implies a higher than previously thought value of the free energy per 120° angular progression (i.e. per one molecule of ATP hydrolyzed), namely 50 pN nm·2π/3, and this matches the free energy of ATP hydrolysis under the given experimental conditions, i.e. 105 pN nm or 63 kJ/mol. In the present work we used the handier semiquantitative torque analysis by rotation rate and corrected the obtained value by one and the same factor by reference to the free energy of ATP hydrolysis under the given experimental conditions (ΔG = 63 kJ/mol). Fig. 5 shows the rotational velocity of filaments as function of their length in various EF1(γ-x) and in the control. The line shows the rate expected for a torque of 51 pN nm. Within scattering limits the average torque was similar for all samples including the control. Observation times were limited to 3 min by bleaching of the tetramethylrhodamine-phalloidine-labeled actin filaments. The perpetuation of rotation did not significantly differ between EF1(γ-x) and the control. Observation “windows” (as defined by finding a rotating filament and continuing the observation until the rotation either stopped completely or the filament was torn off) typically lasted from 42 to 115 s. Rotation occurred for 60 ± 19% of these times. Both the frequency and the duration of stops were indistinguishable between the control (EF1-KH7) and EF1(γ-x). The decreased ATPase activity of the truncation mutants obviously was not caused by more frequent lapses into the Mg-ADP-inhibited state (39Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The average torque was neither dependent on the length of γ nor on the ATP hydrolysis activity. Since the attached actin filament slowed down rotation by orders of magnitude (as compared with the load-free enzyme), the enzyme operated close to thermodynamic equilibrium. In this view it even was not expected that effects on the kinetic parameters, say on V max, would bear on the rotation rate under load and thereby on the torque. The turnover of the load-free enzyme was expected to reveal the effects of truncation of subunit γ on the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Fig.6 shows Arrhenius plots of the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system. The temperature was varied between 5 and 40 °C. Whereas the Arrhenius plots for EF1(γ-12) and EF1(γ-9) were almost linear over the entire temperature range (with a minor decrease at temperatures above 35 °C), the hydrolysis activities of the control (EF1-KH7) and of EF1(γ-3) decreased at low (5–15 °C) and high temperatures (above 40 °C (data not shown)). At close to physiological temperature (∼30 °C) the activity was the lower the greater the truncation was. It was impossible to decide whether this was caused by a smaller fraction of active enzyme molecules in the ensemble of truncated enzymes or to a decrease of the pre-exponential factor. Since the activation energies were not very different in the same temperature range, we assumed that the number of active molecules decreased with increasing truncation length. We compared the respective activation energies in the temperature range around 30 °C. The truncated enzyme, EF1(γ-x), showed lower activation energy (cf. Table I) than the control, e.g. 34 kJ/mol (EF1(γ-12)) as compared with 54 kJ/mol (EF1-KH7). This was consistent with, but did not prove, a weakened interaction of the C terminus of γ with (αβ)3. In other words, the partial removal of the supposed bearing did not result in increased internal friction. It is noteworthy that the decrease of active molecules in proportion to the length of truncation was not related to the Mg-ADP-inhibited form of F-ATPase (cf. above (39Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)). Active EF1(γ-x) seemed to operate just like the control, regardless of the truncation length (up to 12). But the probability to reversibly switch into an inactive state increased dependent on the truncation length. The interplay between the rotor and stator parts of ATP synthase would seem to comprise the entire structure, not just the interacting surfaces of rotor and stator. The chloroplast enzyme differs from the E. colienzyme by different N-terminal portions of subunits α and β conferring, e.g. tentoxin sensitivity to the spinach enzyme (40Groth G. Pohl E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1345-1352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These portions of chloroplast α and β may increase the interactions between (αβ)3 and γ in CF1to an extent even allowing for a 20-residue truncation to be tolerated. In contrast in EF1 15 residues lacking at the C terminus of γ prevent assembly. Lowered activation energies implied that the activation barrier was more closely related to the mechanical contacts between γ and (αβ)3 than to the events in the three catalytic sites and at α-β subunit interfaces. It was conceivable that the major obstacle for free (activation-less) angular motion of γ was the contact with the hydrophobic bearing, which was removed (lowered) upon truncation of γ. A remarkable and reproducible feature of the Arrhenius plot (Fig. 6) was that the activities of EF1-KH7 and EF1(γ-3) crossed over those of EF1(γ-6,9,12) at low temperature. This effect was not due to greater cold instability of the control, since cold inactivation was reversible. Increased friction then is a likely explanation. Under these conditions product dissociation would not be rate-limiting (41Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar,42Pänke O. Rumberg B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) but perhaps the nucleotide binding affinity change brought about by extensive conformational changes (4Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Without a crystal structure of the truncated enzyme this remains speculation, though. The evolutionary constraint responsible for the sequence conservation at the C-terminal end of γ might be just structural stability and/or routing of assembly rather than mechanical function, as mentioned. A similar development might be reflected in the fact that the three noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites apparently are dispensable for ATP hydrolysis yet have been maintained during evolution (43Wise J.G. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6949-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 44Cross R.L. Taiz L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 259: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 45Weber J. Bowman C. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21045-21049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The “lubricated” rotation of the C-terminal end of subunit γ in the hydrophobic bearing at the top of (αβ)3 has been an attractive concept (13Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). An alternative view has emerged from our previous finding that a covalent connection between the C-terminal end of subunit γ and the top of α neither inhibits the hydrolytic activity of EF1 nor the rotation of γ (22Gumbiowski K. Cherepanov D. Müller M. Pänke O. Promto P. Winkler S. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42287-42292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Based thereupon it has been speculated that a swivel joint may be located in that portion of γ. One surprising result of the present study is that both the holding and the bearing function are dispensable, since the entire region of γ can be deleted without affecting rotation.

During the last decade, an increasing amount of evidence has suggested that both aFGF and basic FGF (bFGF) do not conform to the paradigm that protein growth factors act only through cell-surface receptors. Both aFGF and bFGF have been found in the cytosol and nucleus of different cell types. aFGF has been shown to enter NIH/3T3, BALB/c 3T3, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells as well as U2OS cells that were stably transfected with high affinity FGF receptor-4 (2Wiedlocha A.

Roman A.M. Bosc-Bierne I. Amalric F. Bouche G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). aFGF signaling through cell-surface receptors is sufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors and concomitant activation of the MAPK cascade (2Wiedlocha A.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, translocation of aFGF to the nucleus is a sufficient signal to stimulate DNA synthesis. However, both these signals are necessary to stimulate cell proliferation, at least in certain cells (8Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Rapak A. Muñoz R. Klingenberg O. Olsnes S. Mol. Cell.

Despite this, it retains the ability to bind to heparin, has normal receptor-binding activity, and is capable of stimulating the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor and expression of proto-oncogenes (12Burgess W.H.

In addition, both wild-type and mutant aFGFs were found in the nucleus following transfection of NIH/3T3 cells, even though only wild-type aFGF was found to induce a transformed phenotype (13Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Winkles J.A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A number of mutations in aFGF with less dramatic effects were described by Klingenberg et al. (14Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18081-18086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). They altered amino acids close to or in an exposed loop containing a phosphorylation site recognized by protein kinase C. Although all the mutants could bind to specific FGF receptors, activate the MAPK cascade, and be translocated to the nucleus, the mutations affected to varying extent the ability to stimulate DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. As a result of the accumulating evidence of an intracellular role for both aFGF and bFGF, several groups have attempted to identify cellular proteins interacting with these two growth factors. aFGF has been shown to interact with aFGF intracellular binding protein (FIBP) (15Kolpakova E.

Despite the accumulating data for both aFGF and bFGF acting inside cells and for interaction with cytosolic and nuclear proteins, the role of these interactions with respect to the intracellular trafficking and functioning of aFGF remains largely unexplained. In an attempt to elucidate the intracellular role of aFGF, we precipitated proteins that bind to aFGF. We identified by precipitation and mass spectrometry two new proteins that bind to aFGF.

Boldyreff B. Sarno S. Cesaro L. Issinger O.G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) previously found to interact with bFGF (21Bonnet H. Filhol O. Truchet I. Brethenou P. Cochet C. Amalric F. Bouche G. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The other one was a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa. In this work, we report the identification of this aFGF-interacting protein as ribosome-binding protein p34. p34 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (30Ohsumi T. Ichimura T. Sugano H. Omata S. Isobe T. Kuwano R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is a protein that contains a leucine-rich repeat domain and a coiled-coil domain (both presumably located in the cytosol) as well as a transmembrane domain close to the C-terminal tail (30Ohsumi T. Ichimura T. Sugano H. Omata S. Isobe T. Kuwano R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We found that although p34 binds to mitogenic aFGF, it does not bind to the non-mitogenic K132E mutant. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) contained 140 mm NaCl and 10 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 7.2); lysis buffer contained 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4(pH 7.2), 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA.

Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from Saween Biotech (Malmö, Sweden). U2OS and COS-1 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified essential medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Transient expression of the p34 protein or GFP-aFGF was achieved by transiently transfecting COS-1 cells with pcDNA3-Myc-p34 or pEGFP-aFGF using the FuGENE 6 transfection agent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were used for experiments 20–24 h after transfection. All plasmid constructs containing MBP fusions of aFGF, aFGF mutants, bFGF, and FIBP have been described previously (14Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18081-18086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,15Kolpakova E. Wiedlocha A. Stenmark H. Klingenberg O. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), except for the MBP-aFGF(S113A) mutant, which was made using polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis with the MBP-aFGF plasmid as template. p34 was obtained from a U2OS cDNA library made from U2OS cells using the Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT kit following the manufacturer's recommendations, followed by reverse transcription. The forward and reverse primers used were 5′-GCCGCATGCGAATTCCATGACCAAGGCCGGTAGCAAG-3′ and 5′-GCCGGTCTAGACTCGAGTCACTGCTGAGAGTCGGTCTG-3′, respectively. cDNA coding for p34 was cloned into theEcoRI/XhoI site of both pGEX-6P-1 (AmershamBiosciences) and pcDNA3-Myc (constructed by Dr. Camilla Raiborg (Institute for Cancer Research) by inserting the Myc epitope into theHindIII/XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen)). pMal-p34 was made by inserting the cDNA for p34 into the BamHI/SalI site of pMal-C2 (New England Biolabs Inc.). All the constructs or parts of the p34 gene were made by PCR. These partial genes were then cloned into theEcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3-Myc. pEGFP-aFGF was made by inserting the cDNA for aFGF into the multiple cloning site of the pEGFP vector (CLONTECH). The plasmid pRc/CMV-HA-CK2α was a gift from Dr. D. W. Litchfield (Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Winnipeg, Canada) (31Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The construct pcDNA-CK2β was made by subcloning CK2β from plasmid pCMVES-CK2β (a gift from Dr. Götz, University of the Saarland, Saarland, Germany) (32Gotz C. Kartarius S. Scholtes P. Montenarh M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 882-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) into theBamHI/SalI sites of pGEX-5X-3 using PCR. Expression of MBP fusion proteins in Escherichia coli DH5α was induced for 2 h by addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested and frozen at −20 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of column buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA,) with one tablet of Complete protease inhibitor mixture, sonicated to disrupt the cells, and centrifuged at 12,100 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted 1:1 with column buffer A, loaded onto a column packed with amylose resin, and washed with 200 ml of column buffer A. The fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm maltose in column buffer A, and the protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford assay (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) and by SDS-PAGE. Expression of fusion proteins with GST was induced as described for MBP fusion proteins. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of column buffer B (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl) with one tablet of Complete protease inhibitor mixture and sonicated. Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the lysate was rotated for 30 min at 4 °C before being centrifuged at 12,100 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted 1:1 with column buffer B, and 1 ml of prewashed glutathione-Sepharose was added. The mixture was rotated for 30 min at room temperature and loaded onto a column. The proteins were washed with 30 ml of column buffer B and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in column buffer B (pH 8.0). Recombinant aFGF was produced in E. coli BL21. Expression of aFGF was induced for 2 h with 3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; the cells were harvested; and the cell pellet was frozen at −20 °C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of column buffer C (20 mmTris (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA) with one tablet of Complete protease inhibitor mixture and sonicated. After centrifugation at 12,100 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was diluted 1:1 with column buffer C and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with prewashed heparin-Sepharose (2.5 g). The Sepharose slurry was applied to a column and washed first with column buffer C, followed by column buffer C containing 0.7 m NaCl. The protein was eluted with 2 m NaCl in column buffer C. For precipitation purposes, MBP fusion proteins were bound to either CNBr-activated Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose. Binding to protein A-Sepharose was via an antibody against MBP-FIBP, whereas the MBP fusion proteins were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose by incubating 1 ml (0.2–2 mg) of protein solution in PBS with 0.5 ml of prewashed CNBr-activated Sepharose. The reaction was quenched by incubation for another hour with 100 mm glycine before washing repeatedly with high salt and high and low pH buffers. Subconfluent U2OS cells were labeled overnight with [35S]methionine/cysteine, washed with PBS, and lysed on ice for 20 min in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA) with 10 mm DTT and Complete protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were collected with a cell scraper and centrifuged at 3020 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted 1:1 with PBS and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with CNBr-activated Sepharose without additional bound protein. The precipitation mixture was centrifuged at 3020 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C with Sepharose-bound MBP-interferon-γ (control). After another centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with Sepharose-bound MBP-aFGF for 2.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with a 1:1 mixture of lysis buffer and PBS, and the bound proteins were eluted with 2 m NaCl in PBS on ice for 15 min. Proteins were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 1 h, and the pellet was extracted three times with ether. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% (w/v) gel), followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G; and the dried gel was subjected to autoradiography. Defined bands were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin treatment, followed by either MALDI mass spectrometry alone or MALDI mass spectrometry and internal sequencing. The protein sequence data were obtained at the Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Technology Center (New York, NY) (34Fernandez J. Gharahdaghi F. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1036-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 35Fernandez J. Andrews L. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were washed with PBS and lysed on ice in lysis buffer containing 10 mm DTT and Complete protease inhibitor mixture. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted 1:1 with PBS and incubated with Sepharose-bound MBP fusion protein for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with a 1:1 mixture of PBS and lysis buffer before SDS sample buffer was added to elute the proteins. The samples were subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk powder in washing buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with mouse anti-c-Myc antibody 9E10, and proteins were visualized after incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate. [35S]Methionine-labeled p34 and its domains as well as CK2α and CK2β were produced in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system as described previously (2Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The template vectors were pcDNA3-Myc-p34, pRc/CMV-HA-CK2α, and pcDNA3-CK2β, respectively. In short, the plasmid was linearized downstream of the coding sequence and transcribed for 60 min in a 20-μl reaction mixture using T7 RNA polymerase. The mRNA was precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in 10 μl of H2O containing 10 mm DTT and 0.2 units/μl RNasin, and subsequently translated for 60 min in a nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. The translation mixture was dialyzed against dialysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 140 mm NaCl, and 20 mm CaCl2) to remove free [35S]methionine. Fifteen μg of MBP fusion protein bound to protein A-Sepharose beads was added together with 1–20 μl of in vitro translated p34, one of the p34 domain proteins, or hemagglutinin-tagged CK2α or CK2β to a 1:1 mixture of lysis buffer and PBS with 5 mm DTT. The mixture was incubated for 90 min at 4 °C and washed three times with the same buffer or with the same buffer with additional NaCl. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by fluorography. In the competition experiments, binding was performed in the presence of the indicated amounts of unlabeled recombinant protein. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) for the binding between aFGF and p34 was determined using a BIAcore X (BIAcore AB, Uppsala) at 25 °C. GST-p34 was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore) using the GST kit for fusion capture (BIAcore). Anti-GST antibody was covalently linked to the carboxylated dextran matrix of the CM5 sensor chip according to the manual (GST kit for fusion capture). Thirty μl of GST-p34 (5 μg/ml) was then loaded onto the sensor chip by injection at a flow rate of 5 μl/ml. The reference cell was coated similarly with recombinant GST. Injections of recombinant aFGF in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.25 mg/ml carboxylmethyl-dextran were carried out at a flow rate of 30 μl/min, and sensorgrams were recorded. The surface was regenerated between each measurement with 10 mm glycine (pH 2.2). The sensorgrams were analyzed using the BIAevaluation Version 3.0 software. The means ± S.D. were calculated based on four experiments. The human multiple-tissue Northern blot containing 1 μg of poly(A+) RNA/lane was probed with a [33P]dCTP-labeled, random-primed DNA probe using the 560-bp 5′-terminal fragment of p34, the 300-bp 5′-terminal fragment of aFGF, or a probe for human β-actin. The blot was hybridized overnight in ExpressHybTM hybridization solution and washed for 40 min at room temperature with 2× SSC (150 mm NaCl and 15 mm Na3 citrate (pH 7.0)) and 0.05% SDS, twice for 40 min at 50 °C with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and finally for 1 h at 50 °C with 0.5× SSC and 0.2% SDS. Membranes were exposed using a phosphorimaging screen and scanned. After hybridization of the membrane with a p34 probe, the membrane was stripped, rehybridized with an aFGF probe, and finally stripped and hybridized with a probe for human β-actin. COS-1 cells were seeded on sterile coverslips and transiently transfected with pcDNA3-Myc-p34 alone or in combination with pEGFP-aFGF using FuGENE 6 transfection agent. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS, and autofluorescence was quenched by incubation in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After another wash, the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4 min at room temperature, washed, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with the appropriate primary antibody (anti-calreticulin and/or anti-c-Myc) diluted in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk powder. The cells were washed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with the secondary antibody and then washed a final time and mounted in Mowiol. Immunofluorescence images were taken using a Leica confocal microscope and processed using Adobe Photoshop Version 5.0. Antibodies against MBP-p34 were raised in rabbits and purified by affinity chromatography on an Affi-Gel-10 column with covalently bound MBP-p34. The antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.8), and the pH was immediately neutralized with 3 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8). U2OS cells grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium were either permeabilized with digitonin (40 μg/ml) or left untreated for 10 min at room temperature and then washed once with PBS. DSS was added to PBS to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the cells were kept on ice for 2 h in PBS with or without DSS. The reaction was quenched with 20 mm Tris, and the cells were kept on ice for an additional 15 min. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, scraped off, and centrifuged (20,800 × g, 3 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with an antibody against MBP-p34. In a screen for proteins of the U2OS human osteosarcoma cell line that bind to MBP-aFGF, a promising candidate was a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa (Fig. 1). U2OS cells were chosen because they are of human origin, which would simplify the identification process, and because they were used in our previous work (2Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Rapak A. Muñoz R. Klingenberg O. Olsnes S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11972-11980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We chose to work with MBP fusion proteins because the MBP fusion (as opposed to the GST fusion) with aFGF was as potent as wild-type aFGF in binding to and activating FGF receptors (data not shown). In addition to the 35-kDa band, specific bands with molecular masses of ∼28 (later identified as the regulatory subunit of protein kinase CK2), 43, and 17 kDa could be seen on the gels. Also some minor, but apparently specific bands with molecular masses of 29, 40, and 72 kDa could be seen in most of the experiments (data not shown). These bands could represent the catalytic subunit of protein kinase CK2 (p43), FGF-BP1 (p29), FIBP (p40), and mortalin (p72). Both FIBP and mortalin have been previously shown to bind to aFGF (15Kolpakova E. Wiedlocha A. Stenmark H. Klingenberg O. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. Biochem.

To know the coordination of three catalytic β subunits during catalysis, hybrid F1-ATPases, each containing one, two, or three “slow” mutant β subunits that bind ATP very slowly, were prepared, and the rotations were observed with a single molecule level. Each hybrid made one, two, or three steps per 360° revolution, respectively, at 5 μm ATP where the wild-type enzyme rotated continuously without step under the same observing conditions. The observed dwell times of the steps are explained by the slow binding rate of ATP. Except for the steps, properties of rotation, such as the torque forces exerted during rotary movement, were not significantly changed from those of the wild-type enzyme. Thus, it appears that the presence of the slow β subunit(s) does not seriously affect other normal β subunit(s) in the same F1-ATPase molecule and that the order of sequential catalytic events is faithfully maintained even when ATP binding to one or two of the catalytic sites is retarded.

Allison W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The isolated F1 portion has ATPase activity, thus often called F1-ATPase, and is composed of five different subunits with a stoichiometry of α3β3γδε. The α3β3γ subcomplex is the minimum ATPase-active complex that has catalytic features similar to F1-ATPase. In the crystal of the α3β3γ structure, α and β subunits are arranged alternately to form an α3β3cylinder around the coiled-coil structure of the γ subunit (6Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). Catalytic sites reside mainly on β subunits, whereas some residues of α subunits also contribute. The isolated F1-ATPase by itself is a motor enzyme; the biochemical supporting result of sophisticated subunit-exchange experiments of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase (7Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) was secured by the direct demonstration of ATP hydrolysis-driven rotation of the fluorescent actin filament attached to the γ subunit of an α3β3γ subcomplex of thermophilic F1-ATPase immobilized on a glass surface (8Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K., Jr. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). At nanomolar ATP concentrations, the γ subunit rotates in discrete 120° steps (9Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The analysis indicates that the dwell time of the step corresponds to the waiting time for the ATP molecule to occupy the next catalytic site. Further study with a smaller rotation marker and higher time resolution has revealed that a 120° step is split into a 90° substep, triggered by ATP binding, and a 30° substep, probably driven by dissociation of ADP (or phosphate) from the enzyme (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita K., Jr. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The mechanism of how the ATP hydrolysis drives the rotation of F1-ATPase is intriguing. The cooperative nature of substrate binding and catalysis of FoF1-ATP synthase and F1-ATPase has long been recognized and explained by a model, the binding change mechanism proposed by Boyer (11Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), which assumed the rotational participation of three catalytic sites during catalysis. In support of this model, three β subunits in F1-ATPase crystals are in the three different nucleotide binding states: one β subunit with bound AMP-PNP1 at catalytic site, another with ADP, and the third without nucleotide. The β subunits with bound nucleotides take a “closed” conformation, but the β subunit with an empty catalytic site takes an “open” conformation (6Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the rotation of the γ subunit is caused by alternative, sequential conformational transition of three β subunits in F1-ATPase that is accompanied by each catalytic step in ATP hydrolysis. Then, the mechanism that conducts coordination of three β subunits needs to be clarified. To analyze this, the experimental system may have a great value that enables observation of the role of the individual β subunit during rotation. In this report, we describe a novel method to prepare the hybrid F1-ATPase 2Actually, an α3β3γ subcomplex of thermophilic F1-ATPase was used for experiments in this study. However, hereafter in this report, we also call this subcomplex F1-ATPase for simplicity unless confusion occurs.containing one or two copies of mutant β subunit(s) that can bind ATP only slowly. Characteristic rotations of the hybrid F1-ATPases were compared with those of wild-type F1-ATPase and mutant F1-ATPase with three mutant β subunits. The results show that the binding of ATP to one β subunit in F1-ATPase is rate-limiting for a corresponding single 120°-step rotation in these mutants and that the sequence of catalytic events in F1-ATPase is not confused even if one of the ATP binding steps is delayed. E. coli strains used were JM109 for preparation of plasmids, CJ236 for generation of uracil-containing single-stranded plasmids for site-directed mutagenesis, and JM103Δ(uncB-uncD) for expression of the mutant α3β3γ subcomplexes and mutant β subunits of F1-ATPase of thermophilic Bacillus strain PS3. Plasmids pUC-β, which carried genes for the β subunit of thermophilic F1-ATPase, and pKAGB1, which carried genes for the α, β, and γ subunits of thermophilic F1-ATPase (12Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), were used for mutagenesis and for gene expression. The plasmid pkk-HC95 (pKAGB1/α(C193S)/γ(S109C/I212C)/β(His tag at the N terminus)) has been described previously (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita K., Jr. Itoh H.

The plasmid pkk-C95 (pKAGB1/α(C193S)/γ(S109C/I212C)/β), which is a non-His-tagged version of pkk-HC95, was prepared by ligating a 7.4-kbNheI-PmaCI fragment of pkk-HC95 and a 1.3-kb fragment of pKAGB1. The α3β3γ subcomplexes expressed from either pkk-HC95 or pkk-C95 were considered the wild-type F1-ATPase in this report. Plasmids pUC-β and pUC-β(I386C/His tag) containing the 1.4-kbMluI-PstI fragment of the β subunit of thermophilic F1-ATPase were used for site-directed mutagenesis to introduce “FEFE” mutations (β(F414E/F420E)) by the Kunkel method (13Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) with the synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-GTA CGA GCC CGG TTG ACC GGT TTC CTG CTC CGC CAC GTG TTC GTT TTG CGA CAA GAA GAA C-3′ where bold letters are changes made for the mutations Phe to Glu, and italic letters indicate silent mutations that introduce an AgeI site used to identify the mutant. The 1.4-kb MluI-PstI fragment of this plasmid containing the FEFE mutations was ligated with the 7.4-kb MluI-PstI fragment of pkk-HC95 to produce pkk-HC95FEFE and that of pkk-C95 to produce pkk-C95FEFE. The final plasmids used for expression of the mutant products were proved correct by direct nucleotide sequence determination. The expressed α3β3γ subcomplex and β subunits were purified as described previously (12Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Amano T. Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

It has been known that the dimer of β subunits is formed in F1-ATPase through a disulfide bond between cysteines introduced at the position of β-Ile-386 (15Tsunoda S.P. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Yoshida M. Noji H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5701-5706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have adopted this mutation to obtain a β dimer that can reconstitute F1-ATPase with other subunits. The outline of the procedures to isolate F1(1xFEFE) is as follows (see Fig. 1 A). 1) The β(I386C/His tag) dimers were generated from monomers and isolated. The β(I386C/His tag) subunits in ammonium sulfate suspension were centrifuged and dissolved in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl. To dimerize β subunits, the solution was treated with 100 μm CuCl2 for 2 h at room temperature. The solution was concentrated to 200 μl by ultrafiltration and was subjected to a gel filtration HPLC column Superdex 200HR (AmershamBiosciences) that had been equilibrated with potassium Pi buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA). The peak fraction of the β(I386C/His tag) dimer was collected and was applied again to the same column. 2) Two cysteines in the γ subunit of F1(3xFEFE) were labeled with biotin-maleimide. The F1-ATPase, containing three β(FEFE)s but not His tag, in ammonium sulfate was centrifuged, dissolved in potassium Pi buffer, and reduced with 20 mm dithiothreitol for 4 h at room temperature. The solution was subjected to a gel filtration HPLC column (Superdex 200HR, Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with potassium Pi buffer, and the protein peak fraction was treated with a 20-fold molar excess of biotin-PEAC5-maleimide for 2 h at room temperature. Unbound reagents were removed with a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). 3) Thus, treated F1(3xFEFE) and β(I386C/His tag) dimers were mixed and denatured by urea. Biotinylated F1-ATPase (0.7 mg) was thus obtained, and a 3-fold molar amount of purified β(I386C/His tag) dimers was dissolved in 1 ml of potassium Pi buffer. The proteins were denatured by the addition of 120 mg of solid urea and were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. 4) Urea was diluted, and the proteins were concentrated. The solution was diluted with a 50-fold amount of a wash buffer (50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) plus 100 μm ATP and 2 mm MgCl2 and concentrated to 1 ml by ultrafiltration. By these procedures, F1(1xFEFE) complexes were assembled from the β(FEFE) subunit, biotin-labeled γ subunit, and the β(I386C/His tag) dimer. Other molecular species were also present in the solution: assembled F1(3xFEFE), free β(FEFE) monomer, free α subunit, free γ subunit, and free β(I386C/His tag) dimer. 5) The former four species without His tag were removed by passing through an Ni-NTA column. The solution was passed through an Ni-NTA Superflow column (1.5-ml bed volume, Qiagen) equilibrated with the wash buffer. The column was washed with 6 ml of the wash buffer and eluted with 6 ml of elution buffer (200 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl). 6) F1(1xFEFE) was isolated from free β(I386C/His tag) dimer by gel filtration. The eluate was concentrated to 200 μl with ultrafiltration and was subjected to a gel filtration HPLC column (Superdex 200HR, Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with potassium Pi buffer. The hybrid F1(1xFEFE) that contained a β(I386C/His tag) dimer and a β(FEFE) subunit was eluted as an isolated protein peak separated from unassembled β(I386C/His tag) dimer. 7) The disulfide cross-link in F1(1xFEFE) was reduced just prior to the rotation assay. To reduce the cross-link, the isolated peak fraction of F1(1xFEFE) was treated with 100 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at room temperature and was used for assays within a day. Similarly, F1(2xFEFE) was obtained from the β(FEFE/I386C/His tag) dimer and the wild-type F1-ATPase. F1(0xFEFE) was also obtained by reconstitution from the β(I386C/His tag) dimer and the wild-type F1-ATPase. The two cysteines of the γ subunit (S109C/I212C) were labeled with biotins (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita K., Jr. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 16Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To visualize the rotation of the γ subunit under a microscope, a duplex of streptavidin-coated beads (mean diameter: 330 or 530 nm, Bangs Laboratories, Inc.) was attached to the γ subunit. An observation flow cell (10 μl) was made of two KOH-cleaned or Ni-NTA-coated 3H. Itoh, H. Noji, M. Yoshida, and K. Kinosita, Jr., unpublished results. coverslips (9Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Molecules of F1-ATPases (10 μl, 30 nm) were applied to the flow cell and incubated for 2 min at room temperature to fix them on the glass surface. Unbound molecules of F1-ATPase were washed out with 20 μl of a BSA buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The flow cell was infused with 10 μl of 0.5 weight percent streptavidin-coated beads in BSA buffer, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and washed with 20 μl of BSA buffer to remove unbound beads. The flow cell was infused with 20 μl of 200 μm ATP buffer (BSA buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 1 mm creatine phosphate, and indicated concentrations of Mg-ATP), and rotation was observed. Then, 40 μl of 5 μm ATP buffer was infused into the flow cell, and the rotation was observed again. Finally, the solution was exchanged with 40 μl of 10 mm ATP buffer, and the rotation was observed again. These procedures of buffer exchange ensured that the stepping rotation was ATP concentration-dependent and not due to an artifact. Movement of beads was observed with a phase contrast microscope (IX70; Olympus). Observed images were collected through a charge-coupled device camera (CCD-300-RC; Dage-MTI) and recorded on a digital video tape at 30 frames/s. Analysis of rotation angle was performed as described previously (8Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K., Jr. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar, 9Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The biotinylated F1-ATPases were conjugated with streptavidin and were immobilized on the glass surface of the flow cell (9Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The flow cell was infused with 10 μl of 1 nm fluorescent actin filament instead of beads, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, washed with 20 μl of BSA buffer, and infused with 20 μl of 5 mm ATP buffer. The fluorescent actin filament was observed with a fluorescence microscope (IX70; Olympus). Observed images were recorded with an intensified charge-coupled device camera (ICCD-350F; Videoscope) on a digital video tape. Analysis of rotational angle and computation of torque force were preformed as described previously (9Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured at 25 °C in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (17Kato Y. Sasayama T. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) consisting of 300 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 300 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 0.2 mm NADH and indicated concentrations of Mg-ATP in MOPS buffer (10 mmMOPS-KCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2). The initial hydrolysis rate was determined from the slope of absorbance decrease at 340 nm within 5 s after the initiation of the reaction. To generate mutants that can bind substrate ATP slowly, we replaced two phenylalanine residues of β subunits, Phe-414 and Phe-420, which are located at the “adenine-binding pocket” (6Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar), with glutamic acid residues. These mutations of the β subunit are called FEFE in this report, and according to the number of copies of β(FEFE) subunits contained, we designate the mutant F1-ATPases as F1(0xFEFE), F1(1xFEFE), F1(2xFEFE), and F1(3xFEFE). As has been described under “Experimental Procedures,” F1(1xFEFE) was isolated by gel filtration HPLC (Fig.1 B). The analysis of thearrowed peak fraction in Fig. 1 B with non-reducing SDS-PAGE showed the bands of β dimer and β monomer with consistent band intensities (Fig. 1 C, right lane). The β dimer band disappeared and the intensity of the β monomer band increased after dithiothreitol treatment (Fig.1 C, left lane). The disulfide cross-link in F1(1xFEFE) was reduced just prior to the rotation assay. F1(2xFEFE) and F1(0xFEFE) were prepared by similar procedures (see “Experimental Procedures”). The initial rates of ATP hydrolysis by F1(0xFEFE), F1(1xFEFE), and F1(2xFEFE) were measured and analyzed by non-linear regression analysis assuming simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics (TableI). For F1(3xFEFE), since ATP hydrolysis started with a lag phase, the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis, instead of the initial rate, was used for analysis. As expected, FEFE mutations resulted in the dramatic decrease of ATP affinity, and the K m value of F1(3xFEFE) was almost 100 times larger than that of F1(0xFEFE). The K m values of F1(1xFEFE) and F1(2xFEFE) are approximately one-third and two-third of the K m value of F1(3xFEFE), respectively, reflecting the occurrence of one or two times of slow ATP binding in a catalytic turnover for each mutant. 4Assuming that three catalytic sites have the same k cat and independent, different konATP and koffATP, rate of ATP hydrolysis (V) at steady-state catalysis is calculated as V = VmaxS / {S + ( Km1 + Km2 + Km3)/3 }; S = concentration of ATP, Km1,2,or3 = (K offATP,1,2,or3 +K cat)/(K onATP,1,2,or3). Because K mFEFE(K m of F1(3xFEFE)) ≫K mwild­type, K m of F1(1xFEFE) = (K mFEFE +K mwild­type +K mwild­type)/3 = (1/3)K mFEFE, andK m of F1(2xFEFE) = (K mFEFE +K mFEFE +K mwild­type)/3 = (2/3)K mFEFE. In contrast, theV max values of the mutants remain in the same order with the value of F1(1xFEFE) being the smallest. It should be added that the K m value of F1(0xFEFE) is similar to that of the wild-type F1-ATPase (0.027 mm), whereas theV max value of F1(0xFEFE) is about 40% of that of the wild type (162 s−1). The decreasedV max value of F1(0xFEFE) is probably due to the presence of two β-I386C mutations that differentiate F1(0xFEFE) from the wild-type F1-ATPase. The turnover rate of F1(1xFEFE) is about half the rates of other hybrids. The reason is not known, but possibly the prepared F1(1xFEFE) contained more fraction in inhibited states of the enzyme than those of the other hybrids. Taken together, it is safe to conclude that FEFE is a “K m mutation”; the effect of the FEFE mutations is predominantly restricted to the decrease of ATP binding affinity.Table IKinetic parameters of the mutantsF1-ATPase V max K m turnover/sec mmF1(0xFEFE)710.016F1(1xFEFE)380.45F1(2xFEFE)850.90F1(3xFEFE)621-aObtained from the steady-state ATPase activity.1.551-aObtained from the steady-state ATPase activity.1-a Obtained from the steady-state ATPase activity. Open table in a new tab Rotation of F1-ATPase, monitored by beads attached to the γ subunit, was observed successively at 200 μm ATP at first, at 5 μm ATP next, and then at 10 mmATP. These procedures ensured that the observed stepping motions were not artifacts caused by, for example, surface obstacles. At 5 μm ATP, in the case of the wild-type F1-ATPase, ATP binding should take place within 10 ms, and rotation of beads (330 or 530 nm diameter) was seen only as smooth rotation by impeding viscous friction (Fig.2 A, dashed line) (9Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Similar to the wild-type F1-ATPase, all of the 27 molecules of F1(0xFEFE) that we observed at 5 μm ATP showed smooth rotation without steps (data not shown). F1(3xFEFE), on the contrary, showed the rotation with three discrete steps per revolution at 5 μm ATP (Fig.2 A, solid line). The positions of the dwells are separated from each other by about 120°, reflecting 3-fold symmetric locations where ATP binding occurs (Fig. 2 A,inset). For F1(2xFEFE), more than half of the molecules (11 out of 19) in which we detected rotation showed the rotation with two discrete steps per revolution at 5 μmATP (Fig. 2 B). The step positions are separated by about 120° and 240° from each other (Fig. 2 B,inset). The rest of the eight molecules rotated like F1(1xFEFE). This apparent high percentage of the molecules rotating like F1(1xFEFE) is probably due to the unstable nature of F1(2xFEFE); a smaller fraction of F1(2xFEFE) might survive during the procedures of rotation assay than contaminating F1(1xFEFE). In the case of F1(1xFEFE), almost all rotating molecules, 34 out of 39, rotated with a single step separated by 360° during revolutions at 5 μm ATP (Fig. 2 C and inset). The remaining five molecules rotated like F1(0xFEFE), that is, without step. The stepping rotations described above are all dependent on ATP concentrations. At 200 μm ATP, rotations of all mutants were rather smooth, but a rotation trajectory was slightly rugged by occasional brief steps (<0.1 s). At 10 mm ATP, all rotations were smooth and fast. It should be worth noting that even during a long dwell time, obvious single backward rotation was not observed throughout the whole experiment. The dwell times at 5 μm ATP of all rotating molecules examined for F1(3xFEFE) were collected and plotted (Fig.3, top). The histogram is well fitted by a single exponential curve, suggesting that the dwell time corresponds to the waiting time of the enzyme for the next ATP and that binding of a single ATP drives one 120° rotation (9Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The rate constant for ATP binding ( konATP) is obtained from the fitting as 1.8 × 105m−1s−1. Similar analyses were carried out for a two-step rotation of F1(2xFEFE) and a single-step rotation of F1(1xFEFE) (Fig. 3,middle and bottom), and konATP values of 1.6 × 105m−1 s−1 and 3.7× 105m−1s−1, respectively, were obtained. These values of mutants were 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the konATP value of the wild type (3 × 107m−1s−1) (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita K., Jr. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). As described, theK m value of F1(3xFEFE) is 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of F1(0xFEFE) (and the wild-type F1-ATPase). Therefore, the increase inK m value of FEFE mutations can be explained solely by the decrease in the konATPvalue. The fact that konATP values of F1(1xFEFE), F1(2xFEFE), and F1(3xFEFE), obtained from the above analysis are similar to each other 5The konATPvalue of F1(1xFEFE) is about double of the values of other mutants. However, we do not take this difference seriously at this stage because konATP values obtained from dwell time observed for each of rotating molecules varied from one molecule to another. The konATP values calculated for F1(1xFEFE), F1(2xFEFE), and F1(3xFEFE) are (3.4 ± 2.2) × 105m−1 s−1 (23 molecules), (1.2 ± 0.6) × 105m−1s−1 (8 molecules), and (1.8 ± 0.8) × 105m−1 s−1 (8 molecules), respectively. The reason for this scattering is not known, but it may arise from either molecular individuality or uncontrolled difference of experimental conditions. implies that ATP binding to β(FEFE) in F1-ATPase occurs at the same rate regardless of how many β(FEFE) and normal β subunits are present in the F1-ATPase. In F1(2xFEFE), for example, the ATP binding to the first β(FEFE) during steady-state catalysis is neither decelerated by the presence of the second β(FEFE) nor accelerated by the third normal β subunit. It seems that the effect of slow ATP binding to the first β(FEFE) is restricted to the corresponding 120° rotation driven by that ATP binding. Instead of beads, an actin filament was attached to the γ subunit, and rotation velocities were measured for F1(3xFEFE) at 5 mm ATP. As shown in Fig.4, the rotational velocities decreased as the length of the actin filament increased. The observed rotations were scattered mostly between two theoretical lines that assumed the constant torque forces, 20 and 40 pN·nm. Higher velocities are thought to be more reliable because any obstructions against rotation would reduce the velocity. Therefore, we conclude that F1(3xFEFE), similar to the wild-type F1-ATPase, exerted constant torque of ∼40 pN·nm (9Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). This study reports that when one, two, or three β subunits in F1-ATPase become slow in binding of substrate ATP, an obvious consequence is the retardation of initiating one, two, or three 120° rotations. During a long period in which one slow β subunit waits for ATP, other β subunits are also just waiting without letting the next catalytic event start. The principle underlying this seemingly natural consequence is the faithfulness of F1-ATPase in keeping the order of sequential catalytic events. Also confirmed is the assumption that although three catalytic sites exist in F1-ATPase, catalytic events of all three sites are coordinated essentially as a single, linear chain reaction pathway, excluding possibilities of other diverging-converging or parallel reaction pathways. This is another expression of Boyer's binding change mechanism, and this report provides a support for it from the rotation kinetics. Previously, we reported that when one of the β subunits in F1-ATPase was replaced with an incompetent β subunit, catalytic turnover of ATP hydrolysis was completely blocked (14Amano T. Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18128-18133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Two other active β subunits cannot exert their catalytic ability until a preceding catalytic event, which is impossible for the incompetent β subunit, finishes. Probably related to the above contention is the absence of the backward step during prolonged dwell time. Previously, occasional backward steps, about once per 20 forward steps, were observed and were supposed to be caused by the ATP binding to the wrong empty catalytic site (9Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). If so, under the situation in which the next correct ATP binding site is on the β(FEFE) subunit and the wrong binding site is on the normal β subunit, chances for the wrong site to bind ATP (and thus cause a backward step) should have increased drastically because ATP binding to the correct site is retarded about 100 times. However, such frequent backward steps were not observed for F1(1xFEFE) and F1(2xFEFE), and therefore, ATP binding to the wrong site does not account for the backward steps. The above argument is based on the bi-site catalysis model (18Milgrom Y.M. Murataliev M.B. Boyer P.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Boyer P.D.

Sci. 2000; 355: 473-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) in which two catalytic sites are empty at the moment just before a new ATP binds to the enzyme. If the tri-site catalysis is assumed (21Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35422-35428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Ren H. Allison W.S. J. Biol.

Rev. 2001; 2: 669-677Crossref Scopus (723) Google Scholar), only one catalytic site is available for the next ATP binding and wrong ATP binding cannot occur. In this context, faithful order of catalysis of F1-ATPase revealed in this study is explained more easily by the tri-site model than the bi-site model. It has been known that a 120°-step rotation is composed of 90- and 30°-substep rotations (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita K., Jr. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The 90°-substep rotation is likely driven by the energy liberated when F1-ATPase binds (but not hydrolyzes) ATP, and subsequent 30°-substep rotation occurs in ∼2 ms. The method employed here did not resolve the substeps, and we observed a 120°-step rotation triggered by ATP binding. The magnitude of energy to be liberated upon ATP binding varies depending on the binding affinity of ATP to F1-ATPase. Then konATP values of β(FEFE) in F1-ATPase mutants are 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the wild type, and therefore, the affinity of ATP to the mutants is also very low. Nonetheless, the observed torque force of F1(3xFEFE) is not significantly changed from that of the wild-type F1-ATPase. In the converse combination of catalytic site and substrate, that is, when wild-type F1-ATPase binds GTP or ITP, whose binding affinity was lower than ATP, the observed torque forces were not significantly changed from those observed for ATP (25Noji H.

These apparent contradictions are explained by the “binding zipper” model proposed by Osteret al. (26Oster G. Wang H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Oster G. Wang H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 482-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In this model, the process of ATP binding to F1-ATPase is divided into two subprocesses: the docking of ATP and zipping of hydrogen bonds between phosphate moiety of ATP and residues of the catalytic site. The torque force is not generated at the docking process but during the zipping process. The FEFE mutations contain mutations at the adenine-binding pocket rather than at the phosphate binding residues in F1-ATPase. It is plausible that this mutation might reduce the chance for the docking of ATP (or the chance to enter the zipping process), but once the ATP-binding mode can transit into the zipping process by chance, the same torque force is exerted.

https://openalex.org/W2165624934,"Neuronal apoptosis contributes to the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Primary cerebellar granule neurons are an established in vitro model for investigating neuronal death. After removal of serum and depolarizing potassium, granule neurons undergo apoptosis via a mechanism that requires intrinsic (mitochondrial) death signals; however, the role of extrinsic (death receptor-mediated) signals is presently unclear. Here, we investigate involvement of death receptor signaling in granule neuron apoptosis by expressing adenoviral, AU1-tagged, dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain (Ad-AU1-ΔFADD). Ad-AU1-ΔFADD decreased apoptosis of granule neurons from 65 ± 5 to 27 ± 2% (n= 7, p < 0.01). Unexpectedly, immunocytochemical staining for AU1 revealed that <5% of granule neurons expressed ΔFADD. In contrast, ΔFADD was expressed in >95% of calbindin-positive Purkinje neurons (∼2% of the cerebellar culture). Granule neurons in proximity to ΔFADD-expressing Purkinje cells demonstrated markedly increased survival. Both granule and Purkinje neurons expressed insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors, and ΔFADD-mediated survival of granule neurons was inhibited by an IGF-I receptor blocking antibody. These results demonstrate that the selective suppression of death receptor signaling in Purkinje neurons is sufficient to rescue neighboring granule neurons that depend on Purkinje cell-derived IGF-I. Thus, the extrinsic death pathway has a profound but indirect effect on the survival of cerebellar granule neurons. Neuronal apoptosis contributes to the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Primary cerebellar granule neurons are an established in vitro model for investigating neuronal death. After removal of serum and depolarizing potassium, granule neurons undergo apoptosis via a mechanism that requires intrinsic (mitochondrial) death signals; however, the role of extrinsic (death receptor-mediated) signals is presently unclear. Here, we investigate involvement of death receptor signaling in granule neuron apoptosis by expressing adenoviral, AU1-tagged, dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain (Ad-AU1-ΔFADD). Ad-AU1-ΔFADD decreased apoptosis of granule neurons from 65 ± 5 to 27 ± 2% (n= 7, p < 0.01). Unexpectedly, immunocytochemical staining for AU1 revealed that <5% of granule neurons expressed ΔFADD. In contrast, ΔFADD was expressed in >95% of calbindin-positive Purkinje neurons (∼2% of the cerebellar culture). Granule neurons in proximity to ΔFADD-expressing Purkinje cells demonstrated markedly increased survival. Both granule and Purkinje neurons expressed insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors, and ΔFADD-mediated survival of granule neurons was inhibited by an IGF-I receptor blocking antibody. These results demonstrate that the selective suppression of death receptor signaling in Purkinje neurons is sufficient to rescue neighboring granule neurons that depend on Purkinje cell-derived IGF-I. Thus, the extrinsic death pathway has a profound but indirect effect on the survival of cerebellar granule neurons.

Benedict M.A., Hu, Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). There are two principal pathways leading to apoptotic cell death. These include the “extrinsic” or death receptor-initiated pathway and the “intrinsic” or mitochondrial pathway (2Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). The extrinsic pathway originates with binding of death-promoting ligands (e.g. FasL) to their cognate death receptors (e.g. Fas) (3Pinkoski M.J. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1174-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ligand binding induces oligomerization of death receptors and promotes their association with adapter molecules like Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)1 (4Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). The receptor-FADD interaction occurs via a protein-protein binding motif known as the death domain (5Feinstein E. Kimichi A. Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The initiator caspase, pro-caspase 8, is then recruited to the death-inducing signaling complex via binding to the death effector domain of FADD (6Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A., Ni, J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). The resulting proximity of multiple pro-caspase 8 molecules facilitates their autocatalytic cleavage to the active protease caspase 8 (7Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway is initiated by release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and its subsequent association with apoptosis-activating factor 1 and pro-caspase 9 (8Cai J. Yang J. Jones D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). This large protein complex (the apoptosome) promotes activation of caspase 9 (9Zou H., Li, Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway is regulated by both pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (10Tsujimoto Y. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Each of the above initiator caspases, 8 and 9, cleave downstream executioner caspases such as caspase 3 from the pro-form to the active protease, thus resulting in the cleavage of critical cellular proteins and apoptosis (11Stennicke H.R. Jurgensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby H.M. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Green D.R. Reed J.C. Froelich C. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol.

Honarpour N. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Developmental neuronal cell death requires activation of a caspase cascade as evidenced by the substantial hyperplasia observed in many areas of the brain in caspase 3 knock-out mice (14Kuida K. Zheng T.S., Na, S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Aberrant apoptotic mechanisms are thought to contribute significantly to many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (15Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidation of the apoptotic signaling pathways underlying neurodegeneration is critical to enhance current therapies for these disorders. Recent findings indicate that components of both the extrinsic (death receptors or their ligands) and intrinsic (Bcl-2 family members) death pathways are regulated at the level of expression during neurodegeneration or neuronal injury in vivo (16Kitamura Y. Shimohama S. Kamoshima W. Ota T. Matsuoka Y. Nomura Y. Smith M.A. Perry G. Whitehouse P.J. Taniguchi T.

Moreover, transgenic animal models or spontaneously occurring mutants of specific death receptor-signaling molecules or Bcl-2 family members provide further evidence that these pathways are involved in neuronal injury (18Martin-Villalba A.

To examine the signal transduction mechanisms underlying neuronal apoptosis, primary neuronal cultures have been extensively utilized. Primary cerebellar granule neurons isolated from early postnatal rats are a well characterized model system for investigating neuronal apoptosis (20Galli C. Meucci O. Scorziello A. Werge T.M. Calissano P. Schettini G. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cell cultures are highly homogeneous, with greater than 95% of the isolated cells being granule neurons (21D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The remaining cells include glial cells and other neuronal cells such as Purkinje neurons, which demonstrate an interdependent relationship with granule neurons both in vivo and in vitro (22Selimi F. Doughty M. Delhaye-Bouchaud N. Mariani J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 992-1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23Baptista C.A. Hatten M.E. Blazeski R. Mason C.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 243-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Cerebellar granule neurons require activity-dependent signals (membrane depolarization) and serum for their survival in vitro (20Galli C. Meucci O. Scorziello A. Werge T.M. Calissano P. Schettini G. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After removal of serum and lowering of extracellular potassium from 25 to 5 mm (trophic factor withdrawal), granule neurons undergo rapid apoptotic cell death characterized by caspase activation and nuclear condensation and fragmentation (21D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Cerebellar granule neuron apoptosis is attenuated by neurotrophic growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) (20Galli C. Meucci O. Scorziello A. Werge T.M. Calissano P.

Sugimoto M. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 79: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Significantly, both neurotrophins and stress-activated protein kinase inhibitors also rescue neurons from apoptosis in vivo, thus validating the results obtained in cerebellar granule neurons in vitro (28Clarkson E.D.

Several studies indicate that the intrinsic death pathway plays a critical role in cerebellar granule neuron apoptosis. For example, granule neurons display a rapid translocation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bax, to mitochondria and release of cytochromec after trophic factor withdrawal (30Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Moreover, cerebellar granule neurons isolated from Bax knock-out mice exhibit a significant reduction in apoptosis in response to serum and potassium deprivation (31Miller T.M. Moulder K.L. Knudson C.M. Creedon D.J. Deshmukh M. Korsmeyer S.J. Johnson E.M., Jr. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of the BH3-only, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bim, is markedly increased in granule neurons during trophic factor withdrawal (32Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M., Jr. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above findings, relatively little is known about the involvement of the extrinsic death pathway in promoting cerebellar granule neuron apoptosis. Le-Niculescuet al. (33Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) show that FasL mRNA is induced after trophic factor withdrawal in cerebellar granule neurons, and furthermore, sequestration of FasL with FasFc attenuates granule neuron apoptosis. However, additional data supporting a role for the extrinsic death pathway in cerebellar granule neuron apoptosis have not been forthcoming. In the present study, we examined the involvement of death receptor signaling in cerebellar granule neuron apoptosis by expressing a dominant-negative mutant of FADD (ΔFADD) in primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons using adenoviral vectors. Our results show that adenoviral ΔFADD was expressed almost exclusively in cerebellar Purkinje cells, yet it effectively rescued granule neurons from apoptosis. The ΔFADD-mediated survival of granule neurons was dependent on their proximity to ΔFADD-expressing Purkinje cells and required Purkinje cell-derived IGF-I. These data indicate that the extrinsic death pathway significantly, but indirectly, influences the survival of cerebellar granule neurons. Adenoviral-AU1-ΔFADD (34Streetz K. Leifeld L. Grundmann D.

Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 446-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. David Brenner and the adenoviral core at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC). Dr. Sylvia Christakos at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (Newark, NJ) kindly provided rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against rat calbindin D28K (35Christakos S. Rhoten W.B. Feldman S.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 534-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to the AU1 epitope tag were purchased from Berkley Antibody Co. (Richmond, CA). Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the IGF-I receptor were purchased from Oncogene (Boston, MA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Hoechst dye 33258 and DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) were purchased from Sigma. Primary rat cerebellar granule neurons were isolated from 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups as described previously (36Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml in basal modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin (100 units/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). Cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added to the culture medium 24 h after plating to limit the growth of non-neuronal cells. Experiments were performed after 7 days in culture. Apoptosis was induced by removing the plating medium and replacing it with serum-free medium containing 5 mmKCl. The ΔFADD adenovirus was purified by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation. The viral titer (multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (where 1.0 absorbance units = 1 × 1012 particles/ml), and infectious particles were verified by plaque assay. Five days after plating, neuronal cultures were infected with Ad-AU1-ΔFADD at a m.o.i. ranging from 5 to 50. After infection, cells were returned to the incubator for 48 h at 37 °C and 10% CO2. On day 7, neurons were induced to undergo apoptosis. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were fixed for quantification of apoptosis and/or immunocytochemistry as described below (under “Experimental Procedures”). Neuronal cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature and washed with PBS, and nuclei were stained with either Hoechst dye or DAPI. Cells were scored as apoptotic if their nuclei were condensed or fragmented. In general, ∼500 cells from at least 2 fields of a 35-mm well were counted. However, some experiments were performed on glass coverslips, and granule neuron apoptosis was quantified in relation to their proximity to AU1-positive, ΔFADD-expressing Purkinje cells. For these experiments, two techniques were utilized to prevent selective bias in defining the anti-apoptotic effect of ΔFADD and the spatial association between surviving granule neurons and ΔFADD-expressing Purkinje cells. First, 40× fields were randomly scanned under the Cy3 filter for AU1-positive Purkinje cells (see “Immunocytochemistry” in this section, below). Fields were randomly selected that contained from 0 to 4 Purkinje cells per field (where “0” Purkinje cells implied no AU1 immunoreactivity apparent in the 40× field, an area of ∼100,000 μm2). After identification of the above fields, the filter was changed to DAPI, and granule neuron apoptosis was quantified within each given field. The second technique utilized to prevent selective counting bias was that random fields were selected by two independent researchers. Ten fields containing on average 30 granule neurons per field were counted per condition from a total of three independent experiments. Data are presented as the percentage of cells in a given treatment group, which were scored as apoptotic. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Cerebellar cultures were plated on polyethyleneimine-coated glass cover slips at a density of ∼1.0 × 105 cells/coverslip. Five days after plating, cells were infected with Ad-AU1-ΔFADD and subsequently induced to undergo apoptosis 48 h post-infection as described above. After treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized and blocked in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either mouse-anti-AU1 (1:1000), rabbit-anti-calbindin (1:5000), or mouse-anti-IGF-I receptor (1 μg/ml) diluted in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% bovine serum albumin. The primary antibody was aspirated, and cells were washed five times with PBS. Cells were then incubated with the appropriate Cy3-conjugated or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:500) and DAPI for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed 5 times with PBS, and coverslips were adhered to glass slides with mounting medium (0.1% p-phenylenediamine in 75% glycerol in PBS). Fluorescence imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with a Cooke Sensicam deep-cooled CCD camera, and images were analyzed and subjected to digital deconvolution using the Slidebook software program (Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc., Denver, CO). Results shown represent the means ± S.E. for the number (n) of independent experiments performed. Statistical differences between the means of unpaired sets of data were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance followed by apost hoc Dunnett's test (54Ludbrook J. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1998; 25: 1032-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). A p value of <0.01 was considered statistically significant. To investigate if death receptor signaling is involved in the apoptotic cell death of primary cerebellar granule neurons subjected to trophic factor withdrawal, cerebellar cell cultures were infected with increasing titers of adenoviral, AU1-tagged, dominant-negative FADD (Ad-AU1-ΔFADD). ΔFADD is a truncated protein that lacks the death effector domain and, therefore, inhibits coupling of liganded death receptors to the initiator caspase 8 (34Streetz K. Leifeld L. Grundmann D. Ramakers J. Eckert K. Spengler U. Brenner D.A. Manns M. Trautwein C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 446-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 37Bradham C.A. Qian T. Streetz K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were switched from control medium containing serum and 25 mm potassium to apoptotic medium lacking serum and containing 5 mm potassium. After an additional 24-h incubation, cells were fixed, and nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. Granule neurons containing condensed and/or fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic. As shown in Fig.1 A, uninfected granule neurons maintained in control medium throughout the experiment demonstrated a low amount of basal apoptosis (6 ± 1%, n = 7). Apoptosis in uninfected granule neurons switched to apoptotic medium for 24 h measured 65 ± 5% (n = 7). Infection with a negative control adenovirus (Ad-cytomegalovirus (CMV)) at a m.o.i. of 50 had no effect on granule neuron apoptosis (69 ± 5%, n = 7), whereas infection with ΔFADD resulted in a significant reduction in granule neuron apoptosis to 27 ± 2% (n = 7, p< 0.01) at a m.o.i. of 50. At the adenoviral titers used in this series of experiments (m.o.i. of from 5 to 50) there was no detectable dose dependence of ΔFADD on granule neuron apoptosis (Fig.1 A). When granule neuron apoptosis was carefully analyzed on a field-by-field basis, it was evident that the protection observed with ΔFADD was not uniformly distributed throughout the cell culture (Fig. 1 B). Like the apoptosis observed in uninfected cultures (Fig. 1 B, compare the upper right panel(apoptotic) to upper left panel (control)), there were some fields in the ΔFADD-infected cultures that contained a similar high percentage of apoptotic granule neurons (Fig. 1 B,Field A). However, other fields in the ΔFADD-infected cultures displayed a marked reduction in cerebellar granule neuron apoptosis (Fig. 1 B, Field B). Interestingly, this localized effect of ΔFADD on granule neuron survival was invariably associated with the presence of one or more large and irregularly shaped nuclei within the field of protected granule neurons (Fig. 1 B, Field B, see the nuclei indicated by the arrows). The cerebellar cell cultures utilized in this study have been extensively characterized and are deemed highly homogeneous with greater than 95% of the culture being granule neurons (21D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Of the remaining cells, the most prevalent are Purkinje neurons, which display an interdependent relationship with granule neurons both in vivo and in vitro (22Selimi F. Doughty M. Delhaye-Bouchaud N. Mariani J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 992-1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23Baptista C.A. Hatten M.E. Blazeski R. Mason C.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 243-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The calcium-binding protein, calbindin, has been utilized as a marker for Purkinje cells in the cerebellum (38Hockberger P.E. Yousif L. Nam S.C. Neuroimage. 1994; 1: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical staining of our cerebellar cell cultures for calbindin revealed that the large, irregularly shaped nuclei described above in Fig.1 B (Field B) were those of Purkinje neurons (Fig.2 A). The identified Purkinje neurons demonstrated a classical morphology characterized by an expansive dendritic tree (39Vogel M.W. Prittie J. J. Neurobiol. 1995; 26: 537-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Further immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that Purkinje cells were very efficiently infected with Ad-AU1-ΔFADD as shown by their marked staining with anti-AU1 (Fig.2 B). On average, Purkinje neurons made up ∼2% of the entire cerebellar cell culture, and greater than 95% of identified Purkinje cells were AU1-positive after infection with Ad-AU1-ΔFADD at a m.o.i. of from 5 to 50. The lack of concentration dependence for ΔFADD expression in Purkinje neurons over this range of adenoviral titers correlated with the lack of dose dependence for ΔFADD inhibition of granule neuron apoptosis (see Fig. 1 A), suggesting that the protection observed was dependent on ΔFADD expression in Purkinje neurons. As described above, the ability of ΔFADD to rescue granule neurons from trophic factor withdrawal-induced death was unevenly distributed throughout the cell culture, and the protected granule neurons were near Purkinje cells (Fig. 1 B, Field B). To further examine this effect, granule neuron apoptosis was analyzed on a field-by-field basis as described in Fig. 1 B; however, infected cultures were stained with both DAPI (to assess nuclear morphology) and anti-AU1 to identify ΔFADD-expressing cells. Uninfected cells displayed the expected high amount of granule neuron apoptosis after trophic factor withdrawal (Fig.3 A, compare the upper right panel (apoptotic) to the upper left panel(control)). Similarly, fields of infected cultures that did not contain any ΔFADD-positive Purkinje cells also exhibited significant granule neuron death after trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 3 A,Field A). In contrast, fields of infected cells that contained at least one ΔFADD-expressing Purkinje neuron displayed a marked reduction in granule neuron apoptosis (Fig.3 A, Field B). To quantitate this effect, the number of healthy versus apoptotic granule neurons was counted per 40× field in ΔFADD-infected cultures that were incubated in apoptotic medium for 24 h. The granule neuron apoptosis results were then subdivided into three data sets based on the number of ΔFADD-positive Purkinje cells (0, 1–2, or 3–4) identified per field by AU1 staining. As shown in Fig. 3 B, fields of granule neurons in infected cultures that did not contain any ΔFADD-positive Purkinje cells exhibited 58 ± 1% apoptosis (n = 3 experiments, 10 fields/experiment), a value similar to that observed in uninfected cerebellar cultures. However, fields that contained either 1–2 or 3–4 ΔFADD-expressing Purkinje cells demonstrated a significant decrease in granule neuron apoptosis to 22 ± 6 or 20 ± 6%, respectively (n = 3, p< 0.01). These results indicate that the ΔFADD-mediated protection of cerebellar granule neurons from trophic factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis depends on the proximity of granule neurons to ΔFADD-expressing Purkinje cells. Although Purkinje neurons demonstrated marked expression of Ad-AU1-ΔFADD (Fig. 2 B), most granule neurons were devoid of AU1 staining (Fig.4 A). Quantitatively, when more than 2000 granule neurons were visualized from cerebellar cell cultures infected with Ad-AU1-ΔFADD (m.o.i. = 50), less than 100 stained positively for the AU1 epitope tag at 48 h post-infection (4.4 ± 0.7%, data pooled from 3 independent experiments). These results indicate that granule neurons do not efficiently express AU1-ΔFADD after adenoviral infection. Furthermore, fields of infected cultures that contained one or more AU1-ΔFADD-positive granule neurons displayed a similar amount of apoptotic granule neuron death after trophic factor withdrawal as was observed in uninfected cultures (Fig. 4 B). This latter result further demonstrates that the ability of ΔFADD to rescue granule neurons from apoptosis is not mediated by proximity to the very few granule neurons actually expressing ΔFADD. However, it is noteworthy that essentially all of the granule neurons that were AU1-ΔFADD-positive were protected from trophic factor withdrawal-induced death regardless of their proximity to Purkinje neurons. The above data indicate that inhibition of death receptor signaling in Purkinje cells (via infection with Ad-AU1-ΔFADD) not only maintains the Purkinje neurons during trophic factor withdrawal but also results in the protection of closely neighboring granule neurons that require Purkinje cell-derived survival signals. One potent neurotrophin known to rescue cerebellar granule neurons from apoptosis is the growth factor IGF-I (20Galli C. Meucci O. Scorziello A. Werge T.M. Calissano P. Schettini G. J.

In contrast, in an A1 nucleotide-binding mutant, nucleotides still increased fluorescence, but there was no quenching with Mg2+ and Sb(III). This suggests that the A2 site hydrolyzes ATP only when Sb(III) or As(III) is present and when the A1 nucleotide-binding domain is functional.

This efflux pump has a catalytic subunit, the ArsA ATPase, and a membrane subunit, the ArsB arsenite carrier (2Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Zhou T. Walmsley A.R. Biochim. Biophys.

ArsA has N-terminal (A1) and C-terminal (A2) halves that are homologous to each other, most likely as the result of ancestral gene duplication and fusion (4Chen C.M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme has two nucleotide-binding domains, NBD11 and NBD2, both of which are composed of residues from both the A1 and A2 halves (5Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Both NBDs are required for metalloid resistance (6Karkaria C.E. Chen C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

Other pumps with multiple NBDs that exhibit multisite catalysis such as F-type ATPases and ATP-binding cassette ATPases have been proposed to have mechanisms that involve catalytic alternation between the NBDs (where only one is active at a time) and a high degree of cooperativity between the sites (8Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 9Senior A.E. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 213-218PubMed Google Scholar). Kaur (10Kaur P. J.

We have considered a similar alternating site model for the function of ArsA, where the two NBDs alternate between open and closed conformations in a concerted and interactive manner, coupling the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the transfer of As(III) or Sb(III) at the metal site of ArsA to the ArsB carrier (11Zhou T.

In the absence of metalloid, ArsA catalyzes hydrolysis of ATP at a low basal rate (k = 0.001 s−1) (13Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16153-16161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Under presteady state conditions the addition of Sb(III) produces two bursts of phosphate liberation, one of which is ∼250-fold faster than the other (k = 49 and 0.2 s−1) (12Walmsley A.R. Zhou T.

From these results, it appears that both NBDs hydrolyze ATP in the activated state. However, the two NBDs are not equivalent in either structure (5Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L.

To examine the role of the individual NBDs, we previously constructed two single tryptophan ArsAs (F141W and W159) that report nucleotide occupancy and hydrolysis in NBD1 (14Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Zhou T. Liu S. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13622-13626Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In each half there is a 12-residue sequence (DTAPTGH) that is found in all ArsA homologues from bacteria to humans (14Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the ArsA structure these are seen as extended regions that connect the single regulatory metalloid-binding domain with the two NBDs and probably function in signal transduction between the two substrate sites and the regulatory site (5Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Trp141 is located at the N-terminal end of the A1142DTAPTGH148, whereas Trp159 is near the C-terminal end. Asp142 is a Mg2+ligand in NBD, and His148 is an Sb(III) ligand in the metalloid binding site (5Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 16Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. Biometals. 2000; 13: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Trp141 primarily reports binding of MgADP, but indirectly reports ATP hydrolysis by the filling NBD1 with the product ADP (14Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13622-13626Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The response of spectroscopic signals to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis at NBD1 has allowed a detailed analysis of the catalytic cycle of ArsA (12Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I.

J. 2001; 360: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we report the properties of M446W, a single tryptophan derivative of ArsA. Trp446 is adjacent to the A2447DTAPTGH sequence and is in the vicinity of NBD2. Trp446 occupies the equivalent position in A2 that Trp141 does in A1. In the absence of metalloid (unisite conditions), both ADP and ATP produced an enhancement of M446W protein fluorescence that was stable with time, indicating binding but not hydrolysis of ATP in NBD2. When the enzyme was preincubated with Sb(III) and Mg2+ (multisite conditions), ADP produced a rapid quenching of fluorescence. Addition of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues resulted in a stable enhancement of fluorescence. In contrast, ATP rapidly enhanced fluorescence followed by a slow quenching to the level with ADP, consistent with ATP hydrolysis under multisite conditions. Thus, although Trp141 and Trp446 occupy equivalent positions in the A1 and A2 halves of ArsA, respectively, their fluorescent responses to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis differ considerably, indicating nonequivalence of NBD1 and NBD2. These results support the hypothesis that both NBD1 and NBD2 hydrolyze ATP under multisite conditions but that only NBD1 and not NBD2 participates in unisite catalysis (10Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All of the E. coli strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I.

Restriction enzymes and nucleic acid-modifying enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen. WizardTMplus minipreps DNA purification system and WizardTM DNA clean-up system (Promega) were used to prepare plasmid DNA for restriction enzyme digestion and to recover DNA fragments from low melting agarose gels, respectively. Mutations in the arsAgene were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered SitesTM in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega) with plasmid pTZ4H6, which contains the arsA andarsB genes with the sequence for six histidine codons added at the 3′ end of the arsA gene. The arsAgene in pTZ4H6, which had previously been mutated to remove the four native tryptophan codons, was used as the template to produce the M446WH6 arsA mutant (or for simplicity, M446W). G18R and G337R substitutions were then introduced into M446W ArsA to obtain M446W G18R, M446W G337R, and M446W G18R/G337R mutants. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used and the respective changes (underlined) are as follows: M446W, 5′-GGAGCCGTATCCCACACCACGAAACGT-3′; G18R, 5′-TTACCCACGCGTCCTTTACCCG-3′; G337R, 5′-TTCCCCACGCGACCTTTACCC-3′. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire arsA gene using a Cy5-AUTOREAD sequencing kit with an ALFexpress system (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmid DNA for sequencing was prepared with a miniprep kit (Qiagen). JM109 cells harboring the indicated plasmids were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium toA 600 nm = 0.6–0.8, at which point 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce arsA expression. After another 2.5 h of growth, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Soluble ArsA was purified as described (14Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured using an NADH-coupled assay (20Vogel G. Steinhart R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with 5 mm ATP and 2.5 mm MgCl2 unless otherwise noted. Fluorescence measurements were performed using an SLM-8000C spectrofluorometer with a built-in magnetic stirrer. The bandwidths for emission and excitation monochromators were 4 nm. Tryptophan fluorescence was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and an emission wavelength of 331 nm. The fluorescence of the assay buffer (50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5) alone was subtracted from each spectrum. ATP, ADP, ATPγS, MgCl2, and antimonite (in the form of potassium antimonyl tartrate) were added as indicated. The concentration of ArsA was 1.25 μm in all assays. The structures of the M446W ArsA with MgATP and antimonite or MgADP and antimonite were modeled on the crystal structures of the wild type enzyme with the same ligands (11Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30414-30422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling with energy minimization was performed using the program MODELLER (21Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar). Beginning with a derivative of ArsA in which all of the tryptophan residues had been replaced with tyrosine residues and a six-histidine tag had been added to the C terminus (14Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), Met446 was changed to a tryptophan residue. Cells expressing the mutated arsA gene were as resistant to arsenite as cells expressing a wild type arsA gene (data not shown). Purified M446W ArsA exhibited basal ATPase activity of 82 nmol/mg/min and Sb(III)-stimulated ATPase activity of 327 nmol/mg/min. This is comparable to the activity of the tryptophan-free histidine-tagged ArsA (14Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The intrinsic protein fluorescence of the M446W ArsA was analyzed (Fig.1). M446W denatured with 8 murea had a fluorescence emission spectrum indistinguishable from an equimolar amount of free tryptophan, with a λmax of 354 nm. Native M446W exhibited a substantial blue shift (λmax= 328 nm) and fluorescence enhancement. Addition of Sb(III) and saturating MgATP (1 mm) increased the fluorescence, and Sb(III) and 1 mm MgADP quenched the fluorescence. Sb(III) alone had no effect (data not shown). There was no shift in wavelength associated with the addition of those ligands, suggesting that the polarity of the environment of the indole side chain of Trp446 was not greatly altered. To examine the structural basis of fluorescence changes in the ATP- and ADP-bound forms, the position of the tryptophan residue under both sets of conditions was modeled on the known crystal structures of the wild type enzyme with the same ligands (11Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30414-30422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the structure of nucleotide-free ArsA has not been determined, the differences between the nucleotide-bound and nucleotide-free enzymes cannot be modeled. In the ADP-bound form (Fig. 2 A) Trp446 is oriented toward the bound nucleotide compared with the ATP-bound form (Fig. 2 B). This brings the indole ring closer to the phenyl ring of Phe432 (Fig.2 C). In the ATP-bound form, the imidazole –NH of Trp446 is ∼6 Å at its closest approach to the Phe432 phenyl ring. In the ADP-bound form the two aromatic rings are brought closer together (nearly perpendicular) so that the imidazole –NH comes within 3 Å of the phenyl ring. At this distance an indole amino proton can form a hydrogen bond with a phenyl ring that can quench tryptophan fluorescence (22Rouviere N. Vincent M. Craescu C.T. Gallay J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7339-7352Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This suggests that the difference in fluorescence between the ATP- and ADP-bound forms is related to the relationship of the indole ring of Trp446 to the phenyl ring of Phe432. The time dependence of the nucleotide responses under multisite conditions (in the presence of Sb(III)) was examined in more detail. The fluorescence quenching by MgADP observed in Fig. 1was rapid; in the presence of Sb(III), addition of 50 μmMgADP to M446W produced a quick decrease in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3, curve 5). In contrast, either 50 μm or 1 mm MgATP in the presence of Sb(III) produced a rapid rise in fluorescence followed by a slower quenching (Fig. 3, curves 3 and 4). With extended incubation time with 50 μm ATP, the fluorescence decreased to the same level as with MgADP, and the rate of quenching paralleled the rate of ATP hydrolysis (data not shown). Note that the concentration of ATP in curve 4 is only 5% of that in Fig. 1 so that ATP is depleted during the course of this assay but not in the duration of the assay shown in Fig. 1. The simplest interpretation of this result is that the decay of fluorescence represents the change in occupancy of the A2 NBD from the substrate ATP to the product ADP during the course of hydrolysis. Consistent with this idea, addition of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS also induced enhancement of fluorescence, but no decay was observed even with prolonged incubation (Fig. 3, curve 1). When added with MgATP, beryllium fluoride (BeFx), which traps ATPases in a conformation resembling the transition state (23Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6847-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), also produced an enhancement of fluorescence with no subsequent decay of the fluorescence signal (Fig. 3,curve 2). In the absence of antimonite ArsA hydrolyzes ATP at a low basal rate, which has been attributed to unisite hydrolysis in NBD1 (10Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, addition of either 1 mm or 50 μm MgATP produced a fluorescence enhancement of the M446W ArsA without subsequent decay of fluorescence even after extended times (Fig.4, curves 1 and 2). This suggests that ATP is bound in NBD2 but not hydrolyzed under unisite conditions. Under these conditions MgADP produced a fluorescence enhancement rather than quenching, although this was to a lesser extent than ATP (Fig. 4, curve 3). The transition from unisite to multisite conditions was examined by sequential addition of nucleotide, Mg2+, and Sb(III) (Fig.5). There was fluorescence enhancement following addition of ATP (Fig. 5, curve 1), ATPγS (Fig.5, curve 2), or ADP (Fig. 5, curve 3). Subsequent addition of Mg2+ partially reversed the fluorescence enhancement, which could result from a conformational change in the local environment of NBD2 when Mg2+ is bound. Multisite conditions were initiated by the addition of Sb(III). As when the protein was preincubated with Sb(III), this resulted in a rapid quenching by ADP (Fig. 5, curve 3) and a slow quenching by ATP (Fig. 5, curve 1). The ATP quenching most likely reflects hydrolysis in NBD2, since there was no slow quench with ATPγS but rather a further enhancement of fluorescence (Fig. 5,curve 2). What is the requirement for two functional NBDs to produce these nucleotide-dependent effects on Trp446fluorescence? To examine this question, mutations in the P-loops of the two NBDs were combined with the M446W mutation individually and together. The G18R and G337R mutations have been shown to result in loss of resistance to arsenicals and loss of nucleotide binding in the A1 or A2 NBD, respectively (6Karkaria C.E. Chen C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Karkaria C.E. Rosen B.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In M446W into which the G337R mutation was introduced there was no response of nucleotide under either unisite or multisite conditions (Fig.6 A). However, with M446W G18R, addition of ATP (Fig. 6 B, curve 1), ATPγS (Fig.6 B, curve 2), or ADP (Fig. 6 B,curve 3) under unisite conditions gave the same response as the wild type (Fig. 5). Addition of Sb(III) to initiate multisite conditions produced a small quench that may be caused by a conformational change upon Sb(III) binding, but there was no evidence of ATP hydrolysis by a slow quenching with ATP. This result suggests that NBD2 can bind nucleotides in the absence of a functional NBD1 but that it is locked into a conformation that prevents subsequent steps in the catalytic cycle. Many types of transport ATPases are multisubunit complexes that contain two or more nucleotide-binding sites. The ways in which these sites interact with each other and participate in catalysis are still incompletely understood for even the best characterized proteins. For example, F-type ATPases have two classes of NBDs, both catalytic and noncatalytic (25Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To explain the basis of the strong interactions between the catalytic NBDs in F1, Boyer and co-workers (26Kayalar C. Rosing J. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2486-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed a binding change mechanism involving an alternation of catalytic sites, which took two decades of intensive study in many laboratories to be verified. Subsequently the ATP-binding cassette-type drug transporter P-glycoprotein has been suggested to utilize a similar alternating site mechanism (9Senior A.E. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 213-218PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34009-34012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit, ArsA, has two interacting NBDs (2Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Zhou T. Walmsley A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the absence of Sb(III) or As(III) the enzyme hydrolyzes ATP at a slow basal rate, which seems to be catalyzed by only NBD1 (unisite catalysis), whereas in the presence of metalloid salts both sites are catalytic (10Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6378-6391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Under presteady state conditions in the presence of Sb(III) (multisite conditions), one NBD hydrolyzes ATP 250-fold faster than the other (12Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Rosen B.P. J.

From the rate of fluorescence quenching in the single tryptophan derivatives of ArsA that have tryptophan residues near NBD1 (Trp141 and Trp159), the fast site can be identified as NBD1, which identifies the slow site as NBD2. The fluorescent properties of the F141W and W159 single tryptophan-containing ArsAs have been extremely informative about the catalytic properties of NBD1. In particular, under unisite conditions both Trp141 and Trp159 report slow hydrolysis (12Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6378-6391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas under multisite conditions Trp159 reports rapid conformational changes associated with ATP hydrolysis (13Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16153-16161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). From these results it is clear that NBD1 participates in both unisite and multisite conditions. From structure-based alignment of the A1 and A2 halves of ArsA, Met446 is identified as the residue in A2 that is equivalent to Phe141 in A1 (11Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30414-30422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To examine the properties of NBD2, Met446 was changed to a tryptophan residue in a tryptophan-free background. The fluorescent responses of M446W ArsA are quite different from those of the F141W or W159 proteins. Both F141W and W159 ArsAs exhibit quenching of fluorescence with ATP that parallels the unisite rate of hydrolysis (14Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the absence of Sb(III), ATP produces a stable enhancement of fluorescence of M446W, indicating that NBD2 does not hydrolyze ATP under unisite conditions. On the other hand, under multisite conditions W159 ArsA exhibits a quenching of fluorescence that is much more rapid than the steady state rate of hydrolysis. The interpretation of these results is that the highly fluorescent form of W159 under unisite conditions is because of buildup in the steady state of a conformational intermediate that is in slow equilibrium with the ground state of the enzyme (13Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16153-16161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Under multisite conditions isomerization of the two forms is much faster such that a prior step in the catalytic cycle such as product release becomes rate-limiting. In contrast, the quenching rate of M446W fluorescence in the presence of Sb(III) is close to the steady state rate of hydrolysis, indicating that NBD2 is catalytic under multisite conditions. From their evolutionary relationships and overall structural similarities, it is tempting to speculate that NBD1 and NBD2 have equivalent roles in ArsA function. In the crystal structure in which both are filled with MgADP, NBD1 is occluded while NBD2 is open (5Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The occluded nature of NBD1 prevents exchange of ADP with other nucleotides, while the open NBD2 allows facile exchange with ATP or ATP analogues (11Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30414-30422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Yet the occlusion in the crystal structure may result from capturing the enzyme in one particular conformation that represents one step in the catalytic cycle, and the two sites may be symmetric at other times during catalysis. These considerations have led to the alternating site models for ArsA (10Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 11Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30414-30422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6378-6391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is possible that the two sites have different roles in ArsA function. For example, under multisite conditions the role of NBD1 may be to activate NBD2, and perhaps hydrolysis only at NBD2 is coupled to transport. Although the results of this study do not distinguish between different models, they demonstrate that the two nucleotide-binding sites have intrinsic differences. This gives more weight to the possibility that the two NBDs have dissimilar functional roles in catalysis."
