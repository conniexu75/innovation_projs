To address this point, we developed and employed a high-resolution fluorescent in situ hybridization procedure to comprehensively evaluate mRNA localization dynamics during early Drosophila embryogenesis. Surprisingly, of the 3370 genes analyzed, 71% of those expressed encode subcellularly localized mRNAs. Dozens of new and striking localization patterns were observed, implying an equivalent variety of localization mechanisms. Tight correlations between mRNA distribution and subsequent protein localization and function, indicate major roles for mRNA localization in nucleating localized cellular machineries. A searchable web resource documenting mRNA expression and localization dynamics has been established and will serve as an invaluable tool for dissecting localization mechanisms and for predicting gene functions and interactions.

Virtually all cells are polarized, partitioning their contents to a variety of organelles, compartments and membrane interfaces that execute specialized biological and regulatory functions. Since the discovery of the signal peptide by Blobel and colleagues (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975Blobel G. Dobberstein B. Transfer of proteins across membranes. I. Presence of proteolytically processed and unprocessed nascent immunoglobulin light chains on membrane-bound ribosomes of murine myeloma.J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar), the targeting of most proteins to these various subcellular destinations has been thought to occur after translation. More recently, it has been shown that protein localization can also be controlled by localizing the mRNA transcript prior to translation (Bashirullah et al., 1998Bashirullah A. Cooperstock R.L.

A potential advantage of this mechanism is its cost effectiveness. Each localized mRNA can facilitate many rounds of protein synthesis, thereby avoiding the significant energy costs of moving each protein molecule individually (Jansen, 2001Jansen R.P. mRNA localization: message on the move.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This process also helps to ensure that proteins do not appear where their effects would be detrimental. Localized mRNAs can serve many biological functions, including the establishment of morphogen gradients (Driever and Nusslein-Volhard, 1988Driever W. Nusslein-Volhard C.

Moving messages: the intracellular localization of mRNAs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), the prevalence, variety and overall importance of mRNA localization events is unknown. Previous in situ screening efforts in Drosophila have established speculative estimates of the proportion of localized mRNAs, ranging from one to ten percent (Dubowy and Macdonald, 1998Dubowy J. Macdonald P.M. Localization of mRNAs to the oocyte is common in Drosophila ovaries.Mech. Dev. 1998; 70: 193-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, Tomancak et al., 2002Tomancak P. Beaton A. Weiszmann R. Kwan E. Shu S. Lewis S.E. Richards S. Ashburner M. Hartenstein V. Celniker S.E. Rubin G.M. Systematic determination of patterns of gene expression during Drosophila embryogenesis.Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0088)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the detection methods used in past studies were of insufficient resolution to observe intricate subcellular patterns. To assess mRNA subcellular localization dynamics on a global scale, a high-resolution fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) procedure was developed and applied to early developmental stages of Drosophila embryogenesis. Of the genes expressed during this developmental window, a surprising 71% were found to encode mRNAs exhibiting clear subcellular distribution patterns. The frequency and variety of localization events suggests that virtually all aspects of cellular function are impacted by RNA trafficking pathways. We conclude that mRNA localization is a major mechanism for controlling cellular architecture and function. To circumvent the deficiencies of existing in situ hybridization protocols, considerable effort was made to develop a procedure with optimal subcellular resolution, sensitivity, consistency, throughput and economy. Typical results obtained with the resulting method (Lécuyer et al., 2007Lécuyer E. Parthasarathy N. Krause H.M. Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization Protocols in Drosophila Embryos and Tissues.in: Dahmann C. Methods Mol. Biol. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2007: 289-302Google Scholar), versus traditional alkaline phosphatase-based probe detection, are illustrated in Figures 1A and S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online. Reassuringly, control analyses using probes with increasing sequence divergence indicate that the occurrence of false positive signals due to cross-hybridization to mRNAs with similar sequences is highly unlikely (Figure S2). Following high-throughput FISH, samples were mounted and analyzed using epifluorescence microscopy. For each expressed gene, representative low and high magnification images were captured at key developmental stages and incorporated within a relational database. The first 4.5 hr of Drosophila development, spanning embryonic stages 1–9, was chosen for analysis, as this interval is manageable in terms of data annotation and encompasses major developmental landmarks such as the midblastula transition (MBT), gastrulation and the specification of many cell types. The MBT is the period during which developmental regulation switches from control by maternally synthesized gene products to control by zygotically transcribed genes (Tadros et al., 2007bTadros W. Westwood J.T. Lipshitz H.D. The Mother-to-Child Transition.Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 847-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Importantly, our FISH method enables the unambiguous distinction between maternal and zygotic mRNA populations. Maternally provided transcripts are generally cytoplasmic, exhibit FISH signal intensities above background in stage 1 embryos and decrease in intensity during later stages. Zygotic mRNAs, on the other hand, are always first detected in nascent transcript foci within subsets of embryonic nuclei and are not generally observed until stage 4. Examples of maternal and zygotic mRNAs are illustrated in Figures 1A and 1B. An annotation term hierarchy has been created to document stage-specific expression, localization and degradation dynamics of each transcript. In addition, an RNA localization database resource, containing annotation terms and representative images of all transcripts detected, has been established using previously described web-based tools (Tomancak et al., 2002Tomancak P. Beaton A. Weiszmann R. Kwan E. Shu S. Lewis S.E. Richards S. Ashburner M. Hartenstein V. Celniker S.E. Rubin G.M. Systematic determination of patterns of gene expression during Drosophila embryogenesis.Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0088)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can be accessed through a searchable web-browser at: http://fly-fish.ccbr.utoronto.ca. Of the 3370 genes (∼25% of genome) successfully screened, 2314 were expressed during the developmental window analyzed (Figure 1C). Of these, 2198 were maternally provided, 504 were zygotically expressed, and 388 were expressed both maternally and zygotically (Figures 1C and 1D). The percentage of genes that we find to be maternally expressed (65%) is more than twice that of earlier predictions (∼30%; Arbeitman et al., 2002Arbeitman M.N. Furlong E.E. Imam F. Johnson E. Null B.H. Baker B.S. Krasnow M.A. Scott M.P. Davis R.W. White K.P. Gene expression during the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster.Science. 2002; 297: 2270-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), although it more closely resembles estimates from a recent microarray-based study (∼55%; Tadros et al., 2007aTadros W. Goldman A.L. Babak T. Menzies F. Vardy L. Orr-Weaver T. Hughes T.R. Westwood J.T. Smibert C.A. Lipshitz H.D. SMAUG is a major regulator of maternal mRNA destabilization in Drosophila and its translation is activated by the PAN GU kinase.Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 143-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Our higher values likely reflect the thorough gene-by-gene approach that was used and the improved sensitivity of the detection procedure. Consistent with the importance of transcript degradation in the transition from maternal to zygotic control of embryogenesis (Tadros et al., 2007aTadros W. Goldman A.L. Babak T. Menzies F. Vardy L. Orr-Weaver T. Hughes T.R. Westwood J.T. Smibert C.A. Lipshitz H.D. SMAUG is a major regulator of maternal mRNA destabilization in Drosophila and its translation is activated by the PAN GU kinase.Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 143-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), the majority (∼65%) of these maternal mRNAs are no longer detectable by stages 8–9 (Figure 1E). Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis reveals that maternal transcripts are enriched for genes involved in RNA metabolism (Figures 1D, S3, S4A, and Table S1), including, for example, many components of the spliceosome (crn, prp8, SmD3, snRNP69D, snRNP70K, U2af50). This finding is consistent with the large and diverse maternal mRNA contingent, and the need to organize aspects of their processing, translation, stability and localization. Interestingly, these terms are more strongly enriched among the more stable maternal mRNA subsets that continue to be detected through stages 6–9 (Figure S4A and Table S1), in agreement with recent observations (Tadros et al., 2007aTadros W. Goldman A.L. Babak T. Menzies F. Vardy L. Orr-Weaver T. Hughes T.R. Westwood J.T. Smibert C.A. Lipshitz H.D. SMAUG is a major regulator of maternal mRNA destabilization in Drosophila and its translation is activated by the PAN GU kinase.Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 143-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The first major burst of zygotic transcription occurs at stages 4–5 as the Drosophila embryo begins to transition from syncytial to cellular growth (Figure 1E). Approximately half (230) of the zygotically expressed genes detected are initiated during stages 4–5 and continue to be expressed throughout the developmental period analyzed (Figure S5A). Interestingly, several of the earliest transcribed mRNAs, which were unexpectedly detected as early as stages 1–2, are encoded by transposable/repetitive elements (copia, Doc, Ste12DOR). The significance of these early expression events will be addressed further below. As a group, the zygotically expressed genes are strongly enriched for functions relating to transcriptional regulation, cell fate determination, tissue/organ development and morphogenesis (Figures 1D, S4B, and Table S1), consistent with the rapid patterning and morphogenetic processes that follow the MBT. These functional enrichments are in agreement with a recent study by De Renzis et al., 2007De Renzis S. Elemento O. Tavazoie S. Wieschaus E.F. Unmasking Activation of the Zygotic Genome Using Chromosomal Deletions in the Drosophila Embryo.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e117https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050117Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, who identified 1158 putative zygotically expressed genes using microarray analyses of chromosome deletion mutants (De Renzis et al., 2007De Renzis S. Elemento O. Tavazoie S. Wieschaus E.F. Unmasking Activation of the Zygotic Genome Using Chromosomal Deletions in the Drosophila Embryo.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e117https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050117Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, their dataset does not include 337 of the 504 genes that we unambiguously found to be zygotically expressed. Thus, by extrapolation, we predict the number of zygotically expressed genes during this period to be significantly higher (∼2043 versus 1158; Figure 1C). Altogether, our projections suggest that >9000 genes are expressed either maternally or zygotically during the early stages of Drosophila embryogenesis (Figure 1C), representing a vast and complex set of regulatory interactions. Of the 2314 mRNAs expressed, a remarkable 71% are subcellularly localized (Figure 1C), with a peak in localization frequency observed between embryonic stages 4–7 (Figure 1E). This peak in localized transcript numbers may reflect a relatively high demand for localization events during the conversion from syncytial to cellular environments. Alternatively, it may be skewed by the relative ease of detection of localization in large embryos versus small cells. Further analyses of transcript localization in other tissues and developmental stages, and using higher resolution microscopy techniques, will undoubtedly reveal many additional localization events. Hence, our numbers represent a conservative estimate of the total number of localized mRNAs encoded in the fly genome. The 1644 localized transcripts observed were grouped into ∼35 localization categories, most of which are listed in Table 1. The following sections will focus on some of the more diverse and striking of these localization patterns and their functional implications.Table 1Summary of mRNA Localization PatternsLocalization PatternsNumber of GenesaAll screened genes encoding localized mRNAs in either of the analyzed stages; patterns are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

The most prevalent localization patterns observed are the sub-embryonic ‘exclusionary’ categories, where mRNAs are excluded from parts of the embryo, such as the peripheral apical cytoplasm or the germline pole cells that form at the posterior tip (Table 1). Although these patterns might easily be missed in smaller somatic cells, their importance is clear. For example, the pole cell-excluded subgroup is specifically enriched for transcripts encoding ribosomal constituents and factors involved in mRNA metabolism and processing (Table S2). This is consistent with the general need to prevent transcript synthesis and translation in germline cells during early embryogenesis (Seydoux and Dunn, 1997Seydoux G. Dunn M.A. Transcriptionally repressed germ cells lack a subpopulation of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II in early embryos of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster.Development. 1997; 124: 2191-2201PubMed Google Scholar, Van Doren et al., 1998Van Doren M. Williamson A.L. Lehmann R. Regulation of zygotic gene expression in Drosophila primordial germ cells.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 243-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and provides new insights into the mechanisms responsible. Similar mechanisms are likely to be used in somatic cells to prevent translation or related processes in portions of the cytoplasm. Perhaps the most easily detected of the subembryonic patterns are the previously documented anterior and posterior categories. Notably, the number of anterior transcripts is far outnumbered by those that are posteriorly localized (5 versus 198; Table 1). For both of these categories, the sensitivity and resolution of detection enabled the identification of distinct subgroups of patterns (Figure 2). For example, among the anteriorly localized mRNAs, which include bcd, CycB, lok, milt and asp, only bcd exhibits tight anterior localization (Figure 2A), consistent with its extensively characterized function as the primary determinant of anterior cell fate specification (Ephrussi and St Johnston, 2004Ephrussi A. St Johnston D. Seeing is believing: the bicoid morphogen gradient matures.Cell. 2004; 116: 143-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The other four mRNAs exhibit a more diffuse gradient of anterior enrichment (Figure 2B). Interestingly, three of these encode proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization and microtubule-based processes (Figure 2F and Table S3). The posterior group of mRNAs could be clearly subdivided into three categories: (1) transcripts that localize to early pole plasm (Figure 2C), a specialized region of cytoplasm that directs the formation of germline pole cells; (2) transcripts that reside in the pole plasm and then localize further into distinctive rings around pole cell nuclei (Figure 2D); and (3) transcripts that only begin to localize posteriorly in early stage 4 embryos (Figure 2E). The biological significance of these subcategories is underscored by their specific GO term enrichments (Figure 2F and Table S3). For example, the category 1 and 2 pole plasm localized transcripts, which include mRNAs such as aret, eIF5, gcl, Imp, nos, osk, orb, pAbp, pum, spir, and Tm1, are strongly enriched for cell development, translation regulation, pole plasm assembly and RNA localization functions (Figure 2F). In contrast, the late posterior group, which includes genes such as aur, CG14030, CycA, grp, gwl, Rbp-1, Su(var)3-9, and ttk, is enriched for protein kinases and negative regulators of gene expression, again consistent with previous findings that germ cells are transcriptionally silent (Seydoux and Braun, 2006Seydoux G. Braun R.E. Pathway to totipotency: lessons from germ cells.Cell. 2006; 127: 891-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, Seydoux and Dunn, 1997Seydoux G.

Williamson A.L. Lehmann R. Regulation of zygotic gene expression in Drosophila primordial germ cells.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 243-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest the existence of distinct early and late pathways for posterior transcript localization. Notably, no maternal transcripts were identified as being either dorsally or ventrally localized. Instead, differential distribution of transcripts along the dorso-ventral axis was always a consequence of localized zygotic transcription. The preponderance of transcripts localized to the posterior pole of the embryo, in comparison to the other embryonic poles, seemingly reflects special requirements for germ cell specification and the sufficiency of existing zygotic mechanisms to define the other coordinates. Besides the subembryonic localization patterns, a large collection of mRNAs, either of maternal or zygotic origin, were found to exhibit intricate subcellular localization patterns. Classic examples include the subset of mRNAs that localize to the apical cytoplasm within the embryonic epithelium (Figure 3). Although apical mRNAs have been characterized previously and considered as a homogeneous group (Davis and Ish-Horowicz, 1991Davis I. Ish-Horowicz D.

Knust E. crumbs encodes an EGF-like protein expressed on apical membranes of Drosophila epithelial cells and required for organization of epithelia.Cell. 1990; 61: 787-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), many distinctive subgroups of apical transcripts could be distinguished, ranging from broad gradients of apical enrichment to tightly localized clusters or foci (Figures 3A–3E). Likewise, a large number of basally localized mRNAs were identified, which also fall into a number of subgroups (Figures 3G–3I). Other patterns that vary along the apico-basal axis include transcripts that are excluded from the apical cytoplasm or from the entire blastoderm layer (Figures 3J and 3K). The functional relevance of these subgroup classifications is underlined by the GO term enrichments observed. For example, the apical clusters category, which includes mRNAs such as Ama, bib, Btk29A, crb, fra, Gp150, htl, Ptr, scb, sog, and smo, is enriched for GO categories for plasma membrane and signaling pathway components (Figure 3M and Table S4). In contrast, the diffuse apical group, which contains several pair-rule gene transcripts (hairy, odd, prd, run), is enriched for functions associated with transcriptional regulation and pattern/axis specification. In addition to the apicobasal patterns detected in the embryonic epithelium, several mRNAs were observed with asymmetric patterns in neuroblasts. This category includes transcripts such as asp, Gp150, mira, odd, pros, and wg, some of which have be"

T-bet deficiency in the innate immune system results in spontaneous and communicable ulcerative colitis in the absence of adaptive immunity and increased susceptibility to colitis in immunologically intact hosts. T-bet controls the response of the mucosal immune system to commensal bacteria by regulating TNF-α production in colonic dendritic cells, critical for colonic epithelial barrier maintenance. Loss of T-bet influences bacterial populations to become colitogenic, and this colitis is communicable to genetically intact hosts.

These findings reveal a novel function for T-bet as a peacekeeper of host-commensal relationships and provide new perspectives on the pathophysiology of IBD. The intestinal lumen is massively colonized by bacteria, and for most metazoans this relationship is beneficial (Ley et al., 2006Ley R.E. Peterson D.A. Gordon J.I. Ecological and evolutionary forces shaping microbial diversity in the human intestine.Cell. 2006; 124: 837-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Prokaryotes partner with their eukaryotic hosts to aid in the extraction of energy and nutrients from food, and nonpathogenic bacteria suppress pathogenic species (Backhed et al., 2005Backhed F. Ley R.E. Sonnenburg J.L. Peterson D.A. Gordon J.I. Host-bacterial mutualism in the human intestine.Science. 2005; 307: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). An epithelial cell barrier is essential for this symbiosis as it creates a boundary necessary for coexistence by preventing mucosal inflammation in response to bacterial or other luminal stimuli (Magalhaes et al., 2007Magalhaes J.G. Tattoli I. Girardin S.E. The intestinal epithelial barrier: How to distinguish between the microbial flora and pathogens.Semin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, in some individuals this balance is upset, resulting in persistent intestinal inflammation that manifests as the two distinct clinical entities of IBD, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (Rakoff-Nahoum and Medzhitov, 2006Rakoff-Nahoum S. Medzhitov R. Role of the innate immune system and host-commensal mutualism.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 308: 1-18PubMed Google Scholar). Determining the factors that regulate these complex host-commensal relationships and promote the development of colitis is of great clinical and scientific interest. T-bet (Tbx21) is a T-box transcription factor family member that regulates the differentiation and function of immune system cells. Although initially described to direct the development of a major subset of lymphocytes called T helper 1 cells, recent work has firmly established T-bet as a regulator of the type 1 proinflammatory immune response in cells of both the adaptive and innate immune systems (Glimcher, 2007Glimcher L. Trawling for treasure: tales of T-bet.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It has been implicated as a key effector protein in autoimmune, allergic, and neoplastic diseases; nevertheless, its role in balancing immunity and autoimmunity is complex, and it is not well-understood if T-bet protects against or promotes chronic intestinal inflammation (Weigmann and Neurath, 2002Weigmann B. Neurath M.F. T-bet and mucosal Th1 responses in the gastrointestinal tract.Gut. 2002; 51: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here we reveal an unexpected and powerful role for T-bet in host-commensal interactions. Loss of T-bet in mice lacking an adaptive immune system results in a spontaneous, highly penetrant, aggressive, and communicable colitis that resembles human UC. Both the T-bet-deficient genetic background and the microbiota its absence engenders are required for disease initiation; but once established, the microbiota from the afflicted mice is vertically transmissible and causes intestinal inflammation in wild-type (WT) mice. Thus we have identified a novel function for T-bet in moderating host-commensal relationships. This new mouse model of spontaneous UC provides exciting opportunities to further our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of UC and interrogate the complex nature of commensal microbial communities and serves as a robust host for the evaluation of new therapeutics. The sulfated polysaccharide dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induces colitis via direct toxicity on mucosal epithelium. T-bet−/− mice developed more severe colitis upon DSS administration than WT mice (Figures 1A and 1B), as evidenced by a more extensive and severe inflammatory infiltrate, containing neutrophils, mononuclear cells, and more lymphoid aggregates, more edema, extensive ulceration, and crypt loss (Figure 1B). This observation was unexpected as DSS colitis arises from overabundant type 1 cytokines, IFNγ, IL-12, IL-1, and TNF-α. T-bet−/− T cells produce a type 2 cytokine profile that is protective for most T cell-driven colitis models. Indeed, T-bet deficiency is protective against the T cell adoptive transfer SCID colitis model (Neurath et al., 2002Neurath M.F. Weigmann B. Finotto S. Glickman J. Nieuwenhuis E. Iijima H. Mizoguchi A. Mizoguchi E. Mudter J. Galle P.R. et al.The transcription factor T-bet regulates mucosal T cell activation in experimental colitis and Crohn's disease.J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). To clarify whether T-bet's protective function resided in innate immunity, we examined T-bet−/− mice bred onto the RAG2−/− background. A comparative survey of the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of T-bet−/− × RAG2−/−, RAG2−/−, T-bet−/−, and WT mice in our colony revealed that T-bet−/− × RAG2−/− mice spontaneously developed a highly penetrant and severe colitis (Figures 1C and 1D). This colitis was apparent by 4 weeks of age and increased in severity over time (Figure 1E). Of note, our mice are housed in a barrier facility, documented to be free of known colitogenic pathogens such as Helicobacter hepaticus, bilis, and muridarum. T-bet−/− × RAG2−/− (herein referred to as TRUC [T-bet−/− x RAG−/− ulcerative colitis]) mice develop colitis that bears a striking resemblance to human UC (Figure 2A), notable for anorectal prolapse (Figure 2A1), from rectal inflammation. TRUC colons demonstrated continuous inflammation of the rectum and left colon by 4 weeks of age (Figure 2A2b), and by 8 weeks, there was marked inflammation and colonic thickening (Figure 2A2d) not seen in RAG2−/− controls (Figure 2A2c). Microscopically, TRUC colitis phenocopies many aspects of human UC (Figure 2A4) with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria containing both mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells, neutrophil infiltration of the crypt and surface epithelium, and epithelial injury with surface denudations and ulcerations associated with crypt loss and epithelial mucodepletion. The stomach and small intestine appeared microscopically normal, similar to UC but in contrast with CD and most spontaneous mouse models of colitis. Examination of mice from one week postnatally revealed no evidence of colitis until 4 weeks (Figure 1E). However, intrarectal instillation of fluorescently labeled dextran, to test the integrity of the colonic epithelial barrier in 3.5-week-old mice (Karhausen et al., 2004Karhausen J. Furuta G.T. Tomaszewski J.E. Johnson R.S. Colgan S.P. Haase V.H. Epithelial hypoxia-inducible factor-1 is protective in murine experimental colitis.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1098-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), demonstrated significantly increased permeability in TRUC compared to RAG2−/− and T-bet−/− mice (Figure 2B) with 2-fold higher serum fluorescence (p = .0002 TRUC versus RAG2−/−). Colonic permeability increased with age, with a 3-fold increase between 4 and 5 weeks and an 8.6-fold increase between 5 and 6 weeks (p = .00036) (Figure 2C). Hence, a decrease in colonic epithelial integrity precedes histologically detectable colitis and worsens with progression. Although abnormal tight junctions may contribute to IBD pathogenesis (Bruewer et al., 2006Bruewer M. Samarin S. Nusrat A. Inflammatory bowel disease and the apical junctional complex.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2006; 1072: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), EM (electron micrographs) of TRUC and control colonic mucosa from mice aged 2–12 weeks showed intact epithelial tight junctions (Figure 2D: 2 weeks [panel 1], 3 weeks [panel 2], and 4 weeks [panel 3]). However, numerous large epithelial discontinuities were observable on EM by 3.5 weeks of age (Figures 2E1–2E4), which likely accounted for the increased permeability. Further, the degree of cell death was well above the intrinsic rate of epithelial turnover. We quantified colonic epithelial apoptosis by TUNEL (terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling) in 5-week-old mice when significant colonic permeability exists (Figure 2C). While TUNEL+ cells were noted at the top of crypts in all genotypes, TUNEL+ cells were distributed throughout the crypt in TRUC mice, and in many cases the entire crypt consisted of TUNEL+ cells (Figure 2F). Quantitation of TUNEL+ cells/100 crypts for all 4 genotypes showed a 4- to 5-fold increase in TUNEL+ cells in TRUC mice (Figure 2G), accentuated if TUNEL+ cells/epithelial cells/crypt is plotted (Figure S1B). We analyzed the TRUC versus RAG2−/− colonic cytokine milieu in colon explant cultures. TNF-α was significantly elevated in TRUC explant cultures at 4 weeks and increased over time (Figure 3A). There were no marked differences in the levels of other IBD-associated cytokines, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, or IL-23 at 4 weeks (Figure 3B). TNF-α is a key effector cytokine in IBD thought to lead to an increased inflammatory tone of the intestinal epithelium. TNF-α neutralizing Ab therapy is widely used in IBD treatment. Anti-TNF-α Ab therapy suppressed TRUC colitis as evidenced by colon weight (Figure S1A) and colitis score (Figure 3C). The microscopic appearance of TNF-α Ab-treated TRUC colons was indistinguishable from that of control mice. Of interest, anti-TNF-α treatment decreased the number of apoptotic epithelial cells to normal levels in mice treated from 4–8 weeks of age (Figure 3D). TNF-α could modulate either pro-survival or pro-death signaling pathways in cells. We examined the effects of TNF-α on the apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells (CECs), isolated from RAG2−/− and TRUC colons cultured with or without TNF-α. After 6 days, the untreated RAG2−/− and TRUC CECs had quite similar percentages (%) of apoptosis (14.2% versus 14.0%: RAG2−/− versus TRUC); however, TNF-α-treated cells displayed a marked difference in apoptosis (13.7% versus 53.8%: RAG2−/− versus TRUC) (Figure 3E). Since CECs do not express T-bet, their exposure to the TRUC colonic environment likely sensitized them to the effects of TNF-α. Cell surface TNFR1 does differ between TRUC and RAG2−/− CECs even from 2-week-old mice (data not shown). To discern whether CEC death is a direct or indirect effect of TNF-α, we generated TRUC mice that were also deficient in TNF-α receptor by crossing them onto TNFR1/p55−/− mice. Eight-week-old triple-deficient mice showed no evidence of colitis, suggesting that TNF-α signaling through TNFR1/p55 is a central event in disease pathophysiology (Figure 3F). These experiments established the centrality of TNF-α in this model and led to the question of what cell type(s) was responsible for TNF-α production in the colon. We performed intracellular cytokine analysis on cells isolated from TRUC and RAG2−/− colons. Leukocyte (CD45+) populations had higher staining for TNF-α than epithelial and other nonleukocyte cells (Figure 3G). Among the leukocyte subsets, there was no observable staining for NK cells by flow cytometry (FC) or IHC in TRUC colons (data not shown). TNF-α in macrophages, granulocytes, and neutrophils could not account for the levels of TNF-α observed (Figure 3G). However, there was significant accumulation of TNF-α in TRUC colonic DCs (Figure 3G), suggesting that colonic DCs are the principal TNF-α-producing cell type. A time course of TNF-α production of TRUC and RAG2−/− colonic DCs from mice aged 2–8 weeks (Figure 3H) showed increased TNFα as early as 2 weeks of age, prior to any observed epithelial discontinuities by microscopy. Thus overproduction of TNF-α by colonic DCs precedes the development of epithelial barrier abnormalities and colitis. To determine if T-bet was expressed in colonic DCs as in DCs in the peripheral lymphoid system, RAG2−/− colons were stained with CD11c to identify DCs and adjacent serial sections were stained for T-bet (Figures 4A1 and 4A2). While the required serial sectioning prevents precise colocalization, there were many T-bet+ cells in areas of dense CD11c staining. We confirmed this finding by staining FACS-isolated colonic DCs from RAG2−/− mice with α-T-bet Ab and DAPI. T-bet staining (red) is evident, and there is colocalization with the DAPI (blue) stain in the nucleus (Figure 4A3). We next examined T-bet expression in human colonic biopsies. Specimens were stained with S100 (DCs red) and T-bet (brown). A representative DC with T-bet staining is shown (Figure 5A4). Demonstration of T-bet expression in human colonic DCs is a novel observation as T-bet expression had only previously been demonstrated in human colonic T cells (Neurath et al., 2002Neurath M.F. Weigmann B. Finotto S. Glickman J. Nieuwenhuis E. Iijima H. Mizoguchi A. Mizoguchi E. Mudter J. Galle P.R. et al.The transcription factor T-bet regulates mucosal T cell activation in experimental colitis and Crohn's disease.J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). There was no T-bet expression in CECs (Figure 4A2) by IHC nor has T-bet been detectable in CEC lysates (data not shown). T-bet is expressed in both mouse and human colonic DCs. To explore T-bet's role in DC TNF-α production, we used mouse bone marrow DCs (BMDCs) as colonic DC yields are insufficient for biochemical evaluation. LPS matured T-bet−/− BMDCs, similar to colonic DCs, overproduce TNF-α compared to WT BMDCs (Figure 4B). The observations that loss of T-bet expression in colonic and BMDCs results in increased TNF-α production suggested that T-bet may directly regulate TNF-α in DCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and quantitative real timer PCR (qPCR) (Figure 4C) assays revealed that T-bet bound the mouse TNF-α promoter at two T-box consensus sites at approximately −1200 and −500 relative to the transcription start site (TSS) but not at regions examined upstream of −1200 (data not shown), with T-bet−/− BMDCs and preimmune sera as controls. We also performed ChIP assays in human myeloid DCs. Although there is little sequence homology between the 5′ UTR of the mouse and human TNF-α promoters and T-box consensus sites can be rather degenerate, T-bet bound the human TNF-α promoter as demonstrated by ChIP and qPCR (Figure 4D) at approximately −400 relative to the TSS and did not bind more upstream. To investigate whether T-bet is a negative regulator of TNF-α transcription as would be predicted from the TNF-α overproduction phenotype of T-bet−/− DCs, RAW cells were cotransfected with a TNF-α promoter luciferase construct, a constitutively active Iκκβ mutant to activate TNF-α transcription, and T-bet. Transfection with T-bet reduced NFκB-driven TNF-α promoter activity in RAW cells in a dose-dependent fashion, suggesting that T-bet functions as a negative regulator of TNF-α transcription (Figure 4E). T-bet−/− immunosufficient mice do not develop spontaneous colitis although they display increased susceptibility to DSS and have been shown to have increased susceptibility to oxazolone-induced colitis, a Th2 model of colitis (Neurath et al., 2002Neurath M.F. Weigmann B. Finotto S. Glickman J. Nieuwenhuis E. Iijima H. Mizoguchi A. Mizoguchi E. Mudter J. Galle P.R. et al.The transcription factor T-bet regulates mucosal T cell activation in experimental colitis and Crohn's disease.J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). T-bet−/− and WT mice possess an adaptive immune system as do most IBD patients. To test the hypothesis that a component of the adaptive immune system might act as a repressor of colitis in immunosufficient hosts, we performed adoptive transfer (AT) experiments in TRUC. As evidenced by colitis scores, the protection we observed could not be attributed to conventional T helper or B cells because transfer of naive CD4 T cells (T-bet−/− or WT) or B cells did not protect against disease (Figure 5A). The CD4 T-regulatory cell (T-reg) is a potent repressor of effector T cell function that might have prevented the development of colitis in the T-bet−/− host. AT of T-regs reverses intestinal inflammation in H. hepaticus-infected RAG2−/− mice, an innate immune-driven colitis model (Maloy et al., 2005Maloy K.J. Antonelli L.R. Lefevre M. Powrie F. Cure of innate intestinal immune pathology by CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells.Immunol. Lett. 2005; 97: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). AT of either WT or T-bet−/− T-regs controlled TRUC colitis (Figure 5B). Colons from mice infused with T-regs were free of any signs of colitis. Imaging TRUC colons to document that the transferred cells had trafficked to the colon using CD3 staining revealed that the CD3+ cells were in close contact with DCs as shown by costaining with CD11c (Figure 5C), suggesting that crosstalk between T-regs and DCs may suppress the T-bet-deficient DC proinflammatory phenotype. Colon explant cultures from TRUC mice injected with T-regs 4 weeks earlier showed markedly reduced TNF-α levels similar to control RAG−/− colonic explants (Figure 5D). We hypothesized that colonic DC T-bet deficiency might confer a genetic susceptibility to aberrant TNF-α inflammatory responses to the microbial environment. The colonic luminal contents are abundant in microbiota (Hooper and Gordon, 2001Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Commensal host-bacterial relationships in the gut.Science. 2001; 292: 1115-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar), and intestinal DCs constantly sample these microbes (Chieppa et al., 2006Chieppa M. Rescigno M. Huang A.Y. Germain R.N. Dynamic imaging of dendritic cell extension into the small bowel lumen in response to epithelial cell TLR engagement.J. Exp.

Opin. Gastroenterol. 2006; 22: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Most mouse models of colitis are microbe dependent, and patients with IBD often have favorable if not durable responses to antibiotic therapy. To determine if TRUC colitis was driven by the gut microbiota, mice were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics: vancomycin (V), metronidazole (M), neomycin (N), and ampicillin (A)—a combination previously shown to deplete enteric microbial communities (Fagarasan et al., 2002Fagarasan S. Muramatsu M. Suzuki K. Nagaoka H. Hiai H. Honjo T.

Treatment with the VMNA combination cured the mice of their colitis, and selective treatment with metronidazole alone cured the colitis as well, as demonstrated by colitis scores (Figure 6A). Conventional culturing of fecal pellets from VMNA antibiotic-treated and control mice demonstrated relatively unchanged aerobic colony counts (1010.11 versus 1010.16), but anaerobic colony counts were dramatically decreased (109.74 versus <104.01; log10CFU/gram dry weight of stool). Treatment for several months induced not only a 100,000-fold decrease in the culturable fecal anaerobes but also remission in all treated TRUC mice. These two observations drew attention to the potential pathogenicity of TRUC anaerobic commensals. We questioned the origin of the pathogenic TRUC microbial community. Did pathogenic anaerobic commensals expand anew at each generation in response to the developing TRUC colonic niche, or were colitogenic microbes propagated transgenerationally from founder TRUC mice? Genetic susceptibilities are heritable and microbial communities are also “heritable,” as they are passed from parent to offspring (Tannock, 2006Tannock G.W. What immunologists should know about bacterial communities of the human bowel.Semin. Immunol. 2006; 19: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We asked whether the TRUC colitogenic microbial community was vertically transmissible. TRUC colitis is highly penetrant and develops at a young age. TRUC progeny had colitis, raising the issue of whether the progeny of antibiotic-treated (Abx) TRUC mice would develop colitis. We bred Abx mice and examined their progeny, who had no exposure to antibiotics after weaning, after they matured to adulthood. The progeny had no evidence of colitis (Figure 6B). Thus, in TRUC mice, such treatment cures them of disease and prevents their progeny from developing colitis into adulthood. These experiments interested us in the communicability of TRUC colitis. We performed crossfostering experiments to determine if TRUC intestines possessed a microbial community that was colitogenic in T-bet sufficient mice. We provided a mother different from the birth mother at the day of birth to RAG2−/− and WT mice and assessed the development of colitis in these crossfostered (X-F) progeny. Adult RAG2−/− and WT mice X-F by TRUC mothers developed colitis that was histologically similar to TRUC (Figures 6C and 6D). Colitis scores from conventionally reared RAG2−/− and WT mice are shown for comparison. The colitis of X-F RAG2−/− mice was more severe than that of X-F WT. Hence, genetically “resistant” strains can vertically acquire colitis from association with the pathogenic microbiota of affected mice. The vertical transmission of TRUC colitis raised the issue of whether TRUC colitis is horizontally transmissible. Perhaps colitis transmission could only occur in the neonatal period at a time when the immune system is immature, or perhaps transmission required maternally transmitted factors such as breast milk in addition to commensal microbiota. To test these possibilities, adult RAG2−/− mice were co-housed at a 1:3 ratio with age- and sex-matched adult TRUC mice for 8 weeks. Remarkably, both RAG2−/− and WT co-housed mice had evidence of colitis with elevated colitis scores, demonstrating that TRUC colitis is horizontally transmissible. These results suggest that not only is TRUC colitis communicable but also that the T-bet-deficient mucosal innate immune system creates a niche for a colitogenic microbial community. The following question remained: Was the colitis contracted by T-bet-sufficient mice characterized by the high levels of TNF-α that are central to the pathophysiology of TRUC colitis and originate from T-bet deficiency in DCs. Perhaps the transmitted colitogenic microbial community acted via a different mechanism to induce colitis in T-bet-sufficient hosts. RAG2−/− and TRUC TNFR1−/− mice were fostered by TRUC mice and then explant cultures were performed on X-F and control mice. As expected, the RAG2−/− X-F mice displayed evidence of colitis. TNF-α levels were not elevated in TRUC X-F RAG2−/− or TRUC TNFR1−/− explant cultures (Figure 6F). TRUC mice harbor microbiota that drive a TNF-α-mediated colitis in the absence of T-bet yet induce an etiologically distinct colitis in T-bet-sufficient mice. Our results reveal an unexpected role for the transcription factor T-bet in maintaining host-commensal relationships in the GI tract. T-bet fosters harmony between colonic eukaryotes and prokaryotes by establishing in the immune system genetic programs that affect the behavior of the colonic epithelium. T-bet functions in DCs to avoid proinflammatory responses to commensal microorganisms by regulating TNF-α production to ensure the integrity of the epithelial barrier. From the perspective of the microbial communities inhabiting the colon, the TRUC colonic environment facilitates the growth of a collection of colitogenic bacteria. Once generated, this community of bacteria drives intestinal inflammation even in immunosufficient mice that express T-bet. The pathophysiology of IBD has been attributed to mucosal immune system dysregulation or gut microbiota and/or abnormal epithelial barrier function (Strober et al., 2007Strober W. Fuss I. Mannon P. The fundamental basis of inflammatory bowel disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Deletion of IKKβ or NEMO, solely in intestinal epithelium, for example, results in spontaneous colitis (Nenci et al., 2007Nenci A. Becker C. Wullaert A. Gareus R. van Loo G. Danese S. Huth M.

Eckman L. et al.Epithelial-cell-intrinsic IKK-beta expression regulates intestinal immune homeostasis.Nature. 2007; 446: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The characteristics of TRUC colitis described here suggest a link between these two seemingly disparate mechanisms since T-bet expression impacts both the host's mucosal immune system and barrier function as well as the commensal microbial community. An altered mucosal cytokine milieu drives inflammation in both UC and CD (Bouma and Strober, 2003Bouma G. Strober W. The immunological and genetic basis of inflammatory bowel disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). We show that TNF-α is selectively elevated prior to and at the onset of pathologically diagnosable disease, and treatment starting at 2 weeks of age, prior to observable disease, and treatment at 8 weeks of age, in the setting of fulminant disease, are both therapeutic (Figures S1B and S1C). Taken together, our studies have firmly established TNF-α as a key initiating cytokine in our model. Neutralizing TNF-α Ab may act by binding TNF-α in the serum, sequestering it and preventing it from binding its receptor, or by binding cell-surface-associated TNF-α to induce signaling events resulting in apoptosis of TNF-α-producing cells (Shen et al., 2006Shen C. de Hertogh G.

Colonic DCs appear to produce the bulk of TNF-α in the TRUC colon, but intestinal epithelial cells and colonic myofibroblasts also produce TNF-α (Lan et al., 2005Lan J.G. Cruickshank S.M. Singh J.C.

How mucosal DCs decode environmental signals to mount appropriate immune responses is of great interest as its dysregulation is clearly a driving force in TRUC and in human IBD (Iwasaki, 2007Iwasaki A.

Norepinephrine (NE), a neuromodulator released during emotional arousal, plays a central role in the emotional regulation of memory. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Toward this aim, we have examined the role of NE in contextual memory formation and in the synaptic delivery of GluR1-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors during long-term potentiation (LTP), a candidate synaptic mechanism for learning. We found that NE, as well as emotional stress, induces phosphorylation of GluR1 at sites critical for its synaptic delivery. Phosphorylation at these sites is necessary and sufficient to lower the threshold for GluR1 synaptic incorporation during LTP. In behavioral experiments, NE can lower the threshold for memory formation in wild-type mice but not in mice carrying mutations in the GluR1 phosphorylation sites. Our results indicate that NE-driven phosphorylation of GluR1 facilitates the synaptic delivery of GluR1-containing AMPARs, lowering the threshold for LTP, thereby providing a molecular mechanism for how emotion enhances learning and memory. Emotion enhances our ability to form vivid memories of even trivial events. Norepinephrine (NE), a neuromodulator released during emotional arousal, plays a central role in the emotional regulation of memory. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive.

A memory system, such as the hippocampal formation, needs to efficiently distinguish more significant from the less relevant experiences and give priority to the transformation of the former into long-term memory. One factor that is believed to guide the hippocampus in this challenging task is the emotional load of an experience: heightened states of emotion can facilitate learning and memory formation (Christianson, 1992Christianson S.-A. The Handbook of emotion and memory. Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, N.J1992Google Scholar, McGaugh, 2000McGaugh J.L.

An extreme example of such regulation occurs in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by persistent vivid memories of traumatic events (Ehlers and Clark, 2000Ehlers A. Clark D.M. A cognitive model of posttraumatic stress disorder.Behav. Res. Ther. 2000; 38: 319-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (3475) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding how emotion regulates memory is an important challenge in memory research. The stress hormone norepinephrine (NE) plays a central role in the emotional regulation of memory via the brain β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) (Cahill et al., 1994Cahill L. Prins B. Weber M.

Memory--a century of consolidation.Science. 2000; 287: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar). During emotional arousal, NE is released by neurons originating from the locus ceruleus and lateral brain stem tegmentum. These neurons project widely to many brain regions, including the hippocampus and the amygdala, key regions involved in the formation of emotional memory (Fanselow and Gale, 2003Fanselow M.S.

In parallel to their powerful effects on memory formation, NE and β-adrenergic stimulation show profound effects on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), an important form of synaptic plasticity that is widely believed to be a cellular substrate for aspects of memory (Gelinas and Nguyen, 2005Gelinas J.N.

Most importantly, there is no evidence in behaving animals showing a role for these candidate molecules in NE-facilitated learning. Therefore, the molecular mechanism linking NE signaling to LTP facilitation and memory enhancement remains to be elucidated.

AMPA receptors are ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate the majority of the fast excitatory transmission in the brain. They are heterotetramers, comprised of a combinatorial assembly of four subunits, GluR1–GluR4 (Hollmann and Heinemann, 1994Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Cloned glutamate receptors.Annu. Rev.

The functional role of phosphorylation of Ser831 and Ser845 sites, in particular, has been extensively characterized. Ser831 is phosphorylated by CaMKII and protein kinase C (PKC), whereas Ser845 is phosphorylated by PKA (Barria et al., 1997Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R.

State-dependent Ras signaling and AMPA receptor trafficking.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2000-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Genetically modified mice with knockin mutations that block phosphorylation at Ser845 and Ser831 sites of GluR1 show subtle disturbances in synaptic plasticity and learning (Lee et al., 2003Lee H.K. Takamiya K. Han J.S. Man H. Kim C.H. Rumbaugh G. Yu S. Ding L. He C.

These previous results suggest that these phosphorylation sites may play modulatory rather than essential roles in plasticity and memory formation. We set out to test the hypothesis that NE-driven phosphorylation of GluR1 facilitates AMPA-receptor trafficking to synapses and LTP induction, and as a consequence, lowers the threshold for formation of memory. We show here that (1) NE signaling induces phosphorylation of the Ser845 and Ser831 sites of GluR1 both in vitro and in vivo, and emotional stress mimics this modulation; (2) NE facilitation of CA1 LTP follows a similar time course as the GluR1 phosphorylation; (3) the synaptic delivery of GluR1 is facilitated by NE through the phosphorylation at Ser845 and Ser831 sites; and (4) phosphomutant mice with knockin mutations on the GluR1 phosphorylation sites have similar defects in NE-facilitated LTP and NE-enhanced contextual memory task: weak stimuli, which lead to NE-facilitated synaptic plasticity and memory in wild-type mice do not show facilitation in phosphomutant mice, and strong stimuli lead to plasticity and learning that are little affected by NE or phosphomutation. These results establish a central role of NE-regulated AMPA receptor trafficking in the emotional regulation of learning and memory. The GluR1 subunit of the AMPAR contains two phosphorylation sites, Ser845 (PKA site) and Ser831 (PKC/CaMKII site), which regulate GluR1 trafficking and function in vitro and in vivo (Banke et al., 2000Banke T.G.

To test the effect of NE on GluR1 phosphorylation on these two sites, we incubated organotypic hippocampal slices in NE-containing medium (10 μM, 10 min) and assayed for the change in GluR1 phosphorylation. NE treatment caused a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser845 (224 ± 18% of control, p < 0.001) and a smaller but significant increase of phosphorylation at Ser831 (129 ± 11% of control, p < 0.05) (Figure 1A). Phosphorylation of both sites was relatively transient: 30 min after NE washout, the magnitude of phosphorylation was reduced to 155 ± 29% (p < 0.05) for Ser845 and 114 ± 13% (p = 0.05) for Ser831. By 90 min after NE washout, the level of phosphorylation was no longer significantly different from basal levels (Figure 1A). Similar results were obtained when NE was applied to acute hippocampal slices made from adult mice (data not shown). Ser818, another phosphorylation site on GluR1 recently implicated in AMPAR trafficking (Boehm et al., 2006Boehm J. Kang M.G. Johnson R.C. Esteban J. Huganir R.L. Malinow R. Synaptic incorporation of AMPA receptors during LTP is controlled by a PKC phosphorylation site on GluR1.Neuron. 2006; 51: 213-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) does not show NE-induced phosphorylation change (108 ± 4% of control, p = 0.9). To further characterize the signaling events that lead to NE-induced GluR1 phosphorylation, we applied NE on organotypic hippocampal slice pretreated with different pharmacological reagents (Figure 1B). Consistent with a previous study that showed β-AR activation couples to PKA phosphorylation of GluR1 (Vanhoose and Winder, 2003Vanhoose A.M. Winder D.G. NMDA and beta1-adrenergic receptors differentially signal phosphorylation of glutamate receptor type 1 in area CA1 of hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5827-5834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NE-induced GluR1 Ser845 phosphorylation was blocked by the β-AR antagonist propranolol (10 μM) but not by the α-AR antagonist phentolamine (50 μM) (Figure 1B). As expected for a PKA phosphorylation site, Ser845 phosphorylation was sensitive to PKA inhibitor KT5720 (4 μM) but not CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (20 μM) (Figure 1B). Similar analysis on Ser831 site revealed that the NE-induced Ser831 phosphorylation depends on β-AR signaling and CaMKII activity (Figure 1B). These results suggest that NE signals through β-ARs and then through PKA and CaMKII in a parallel fashion, leading to phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser845 and Ser831 sites respectively. We next examined whether similar modulation of GluR1 by NE occurs in animals in vivo. Mice were injected systemically with either saline or epinephrine, a drug that can elevate NE level in the central nervous system (CNS) (McGaugh et al., 1996McGaugh J.L. Cahill L. Roozendaal B. Involvement of the amygdala in memory storage: interaction with other brain systems.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 13508-13514Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, Liang et al., 1986Liang K.C. Juler R.G. McGaugh J.L. Modulating effects of posttraining epinephrine on memory: involvement of the amygdala noradrenergic system.Brain Res. 1986; 368: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), and hippocampal lysates were analyzed (Figure 2Aa). Compared with saline injection, epinephrine (0.5 mg/kg, a dose that was previously shown to enhance contextual fear memory in mice [Frankland et al., 2004Frankland P.W. Josselyn S.A. Anagnostaras S.G. Kogan J.H. Takahashi E. Silva A.J. Consolidation of CS and US representations in associative fear conditioning.Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar]) caused increased phosphorylation of GluR1 at the Ser845 (172 ± 28% of control, p < 0.05) site (Figure 2A). There is also a tendency of increase at the Ser831 (131 ± 16% of control, p = 0.08) site (Figure 2A) . Next, to test if natural emotional stress can produce similar effects on GluR1 phosphorylation, we employed a fox urine assay (Figure 2Ba). Fox urine exposure causes innate fear (Figure 2Bd) and augments NE release in the brain (Hayley et al., 2001Hayley S. Borowski T. Merali Z. Anisman H. Central monoamine activity in genetically distinct strains of mice following a psychogenic stressor: effects of predator exposure.Brain Res. 2001; 892: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hippocampi from mice exposed to fox urine showed elevated Ser845 (200 ± 34%, p < 0.05) and Ser831 phosphorylation (126 ± 10%, p < 0.05) of GluR1 (Figure 2B). The increase in phosphorylation was largely abolished in mice preinjected with the β-AR blocker propranolol (112 ± 17%, p = 0.45 for Ser845; 103 ± 13%, p = 0.58 for Ser831), indicating that NE and β-ARs likely mediate the effect of emotional stress on GluR1 phosphorylation (Figure 2B). A predominant component of hippocampal activity in behaving animals occurs at the θ frequency (5–12 Hz).

We speculated that phosphorylation of GluR1 is a critical molecular event downstream of NE mediating its facilitatory effect on LTP.

https://openalex.org/W1970148441,"The motion of domain walls is critical to many applications involving ferroelectric materials, such as fast high-density non-volatile random access memory. In memories of this sort, storing a data bit means increasing the size of one polar region at the expense of another, and hence the movement of a domain wall separating these regions. Experimental measurements of domain growth rates in the well-established ferroelectrics PbTiO3 and BaTiO3 have been performed, but the development of new materials has been hampered by a lack of microscopic understanding of how domain walls move. Despite some success in interpreting domain-wall motion in terms of classical nucleation and growth models, these models were formulated without insight from first-principles-based calculations, and they portray a picture of a large, triangular nucleus that leads to unrealistically large depolarization and nucleation energies. Here we use atomistic molecular dynamics and coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations to analyse these processes, and demonstrate that the prevailing models are incorrect. Our multi-scale simulations reproduce experimental domain growth rates in PbTiO3 and reveal small, square critical nuclei with a diffuse interface. A simple analytic model is also proposed, relating bulk polarization and gradient energies to wall nucleation and growth, and thus rationalizing all experimental rate measurements in PbTiO3 and BaTiO3."

Repeated presentations of the same odor elicit more reproducible responses in second-order projection neurons (PNs) than in their presynaptic olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). PN responses rise and accommodate rapidly, emphasizing odor onset. Furthermore, weak ORN inputs are amplified in the PN layer but strong inputs are not. This nonlinear transformation broadens PN tuning and produces more uniform distances between odor representations in PN coding space. In addition, portions of the odor response profile of a PN are not systematically related to their direct ORN inputs, which probably indicates the presence of lateral connections between glomeruli. Finally, we show that a linear discriminator classifies odors more accurately using PN spike trains than using an equivalent number of ORN spike trains."

Proviral DNAs are potently silenced at the level of transcription in these cells. This silencing is largely due to an unidentified trans-acting factor that is thought to bind to the primer binding site (PBS) of M-MLV and repress transcription from the viral promoter. We have partially purified a large PBS-mediated silencing complex and identified TRIM28 (Kap-1), a known transcriptional silencer, as an integral component of the complex. We show that RNAi-mediated knockdown of TRIM28 in EC and ES cells relieves the restriction and that TRIM28 is bound to the PBS in vivo when restriction takes place. The identification of TRIM28 as a retroviral silencer adds to the growing body of evidence that many TRIM family proteins are involved in retroviral restriction."

https://openalex.org/W1983832181,"microRNAs (miRNAs) bind to specific messenger RNA targets to posttranscriptionally modulate their expression. Understanding the regulatory relationships between miRNAs and targets remains a major challenge. Many miRNAs reduce expression of their targets to inconsequential levels. It has also been proposed that miRNAs might adjust target expression to an optimal level. Here we analyze the consequences of mutating the conserved miRNA miR-8 in Drosophila. We identify atrophin as a direct target of miR-8. miR-8 mutant phenotypes are attributable to elevated atrophin activity, resulting in elevated apoptosis in the brain and in behavioral defects. Reduction of atrophin levels in miR-8-expressing cells to below the level generated by miR-8 regulation is detrimental, providing evidence for a ""tuning target"" relationship between them. Drosophila atrophin is related to the atrophin family of mammalian transcriptional regulators, implicated in the neurodegenerative disorder DRPLA.

The miRNA expression profiles are distinct among the tumor types as demonstrated by an unsupervised hierarchical clustering, and unique miRNA expression signatures were identified in each tumor class. Remarkably, the miRNA expression patterns suggested that two of the sarcomas had been misdiagnosed and this was confirmed by reevaluation of the tumors using histopathologic and molecular analyses. Using the cloning approach, we also identified 31 novel miRNAs or other small RNA effectors in the sarcomas and normal skeletal muscle tissues examined.

Although we found assignment of border ownership for attended and for ignored figures, attentional modulation was stronger when the attended figure was located on the neuron's preferred side of border ownership. When the border between two overlapping figures was placed in the receptive field, responses depended on the side of attention, and enhancement was generally found on the neuron's preferred side of border ownership. This correlation suggests that the neural network that creates figure-ground organization also provides the interface for the top-down selection process."

By binding to IFNαR2 within the region where two adjacent proline boxes bear phospho-Ser364 and phospho-Ser384, CBP acetylates IFNαR2 on Lys399, which in turn serves as the docking site for interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9). IRF9 interacts with the acetyl-Lys399 motif by means of its IRF homology2 (IH2) domain, leading to formation of the ISGF3 complex that includes IRF9, STAT1, and STAT2. All three components are acetylated by CBP. Remarkably, acetylation within the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of both IRF9 and STAT2 is critical for the ISGF3 complex activation and its associated antiviral gene regulation. These results have significant implications concerning the central role of acetylation in cytokine receptor signal transduction.

Remarkably, acetylation within the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of both IRF9 and STAT2 is critical for the ISGF3 complex activation and its associated antiviral gene regulation. These results have significant implications concerning the central role of acetylation in cytokine receptor signal transduction. IFNαR1 and IFNαR2 belong to class II transmembrane cytokine receptors that are shared by all type I IFN family members. Despite their similarity, neither one can function independently during signaling for IFNα. By binding to IFNαR1 and IFNαR2, IFNα triggers their oligomerization and receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) activation, leading to receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Among the cytoplasmic molecules responding to IFNα for activation, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are the most prominent SH2 domain bearing transcription factors recruited by IFNα receptors for transcriptional regulation. Although IFNα can activate all seven STAT members, STAT1 and STAT2 activation have been most closely linked to IFNα's antiviral activity. While STAT2 can be recruited by both IFNαR2 and IFNαR1, STAT1 activation by IFNα mainly depends on the presence of STAT2 in the cell (Leung et al., 1995Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Role of STAT2 in the alpha interferon signaling pathway.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). STAT2 binds to IFNαR2 much stronger than it binds to IFNαR1 (Saleh et al., 2002Saleh A.Z. Nguyen V.P. Krolewski J.J. Affinity of Stat2 for the subunits of the interferon alpha receptor.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11261-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting a prominent role of IFNαR2 in STAT recruitment and activation. However, STAT2 recruitment by IFNαR2 can be both IFNαR2 tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent and -independent (Nguyen et al., 2002Nguyen V.P. Saleh A.Z. Arch A.E. Yan H. Piazza F. Kim J. Krolewski J.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, when STAT2 contains a βB Arg → Gln mutation in the SH2 domain, it can still be recruited by the IFNα receptor; and STAT1 and STAT2 still can form heterodimers independent of their phosphorylation status (Stancato et al., 1996Stancato L.F. David M. Carter-Su C. Larner A.C. Pratt W.B. Preassociation of STAT1 with STAT2 and STAT3 in separate signalling complexes prior to cytokine stimulation.J. Biol.

Functional subdomains of STAT2 required for preassociation with the alpha interferon receptor and for signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This indicates that additional posttranslational modification events may be involved in the IFNα receptor-STAT pathway activation. STAT2 is notably distinct from the rest of STAT family members as its β-barrel DNA-binding domain (DBD) is essentially not involved in DNA binding. STAT2 acts as an adaptor to recruit STAT1 either to IFNαR2 for activation or to IRF9 to form the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex. The IFNα activated ISGF3 complex translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) present in the promoters of many antiviral genes. Within the ISGF3 complex, IRF9 and STAT1 cooperatively contact the ISRE element at neighboring bases. The N-terminal domain (1–120 residues) of IRF9, a highly conserved helix-turn-helix structure among all IRF family members, is responsible for DNA binding. The C-terminal domain of IRF9, is also largely conserved among many IRF family members (except IRF1 and IRF2) and is homologous to the MAD homology2 (MH2) domain of SMAD proteins (Qin et al., 2003Qin B.Y. Liu C. Lam S.S. Srinath H. Delston R. Correia J.J. Derynck R. Lin K. Crystal structure of IRF-3 reveals mechanism of autoinhibition and virus-induced phosphoactivation.Nat. Struct.

Inagaki F. X-ray crystal structure of IRF-3 and its functional implications.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The MH2 domain of SMAD may play an important role in TGFβ receptor association and SMAD dimerization (Wu et al., 2001Wu J.W. Hu M. Chai J. Seoane J. Huse M. Li C. Rigotti D.J. Kyin S. Muir T.W. Fairman R. et al.Crystal structure of a phosphorylated Smad2. Recognition of phosphoserine by the MH2 domain and insights on Smad function in TGF-beta signaling.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1277-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It is worthwhile to note that the MH2 domain of SMAD3 is acetylated, suggesting a role of this domain in acetylation-relevant signal transduction (Inoue et al., 2006Inoue Y. Itoh Y. Abe K. Okamoto T. Daitoku H. Fukamizu A. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. Smad3 is acetylated by p300/CBP to regulate its transactivation activity.Oncogene. 2006; 26: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For IRF members, serine phosphorylation within the C-terminal regulatory domain is related to their activation by viruses or by Toll-like receptor ligation. In addition to C-terminal serine phosphorylation, both SMAD and IRF members undergo CBP/p300-mediated acetylation modification within their N-terminal DBD (Masumi et al., 2003Masumi A. Yamakawa Y. Fukazawa H. Ozato K. Komuro K. Interferon regulatory factor-2 regulates cell growth through its acetylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25401-25407Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, Caillaud et al., 2002Caillaud A. Prakash A. Smith E. Masumi A. Hovanessian A.G. Levy D.E. Marie I. Acetylation of interferon regulatory factor-7 by p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP)-associated factor (PCAF) impairs its DNA binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49417-49421Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although CBP/p300 and cofactors exclusively enhance transcriptional activity of IRF or SMAD, the functional significance of acetylation within the DBD for transcriptional activity remains unclear. The molecular mechanism of IRF9 activation leads to ISGF3 complex formation, and its subsequent DNA binding remains a critical missing link in understanding IFNα signaling. Recently, we showed that STAT3 activation by cytokines including IFNα required CBP/p300-mediated acetylation (Yuan et al., 2005Yuan Z.L. Guan Y.J. Chatterjee D. Chin Y.E. Stat3 dimerization regulated by reversible acetylation of a single lysine residue.Science. 2005; 307: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The cytoplasm is a de facto arena for STAT to undergo dynamic posttranslational modifications, including both phosphorylation and acetylation, suggesting CBP/p300 may function as a cytoplasmic acetyltransferase in cells. In view of the direct interaction between CBP/p300 and STAT2, which is IFNα stimulation dependent and required for subsequent ISGF3 antiviral activity (Bhattacharya et al., 1996Bhattacharya S. Eckner R. Grossman S. Oldread E. Arany Z. D'Andrea A. Livingston D.M. Cooperation of Stat2 and p300/CBP in signaling induced by interferon-alpha.Nature. 1996; 383: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), it is possible that CBP/p300 acetyltransferase activity is under the immediate regulation of the IFNα receptor. In this report, we demonstrate that in IFNα-treated cells IFNαR2 recruits CBP to initiate an acetylation cascade in cytoplasm. Although CBP exists mainly in nuclei of quiescent cells, IFNα treatment accelerates its cytoplasmic accumulation. A detailed protein-interaction analysis reveals that CBP-acetylated IFNαR2 and IRF9 undergo modular interaction, leading to ISGF3 activation. Thus, acetylation plays a critical role in activation of cytokine receptors and their downstream signaling molecules. To investigate IFNα-stimulated acetylation of the ISGF3 components, we examined the subcellular localization of various HAT proteins before and after IFNα treatment of HeLa cells. Both p300 and CBP were detectable in the cytoplasmic fraction prepared from HeLa cells, albeit at relatively low levels. Upon IFNα treatment, however, the steady-state cytoplasmic CBP level was increased, accompanied by a gradual reduction of nuclear CBP levels (Figure 1A). This finding suggested that CBP may normally shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and that IFNα treatment can promote this process. Meanwhile, we observed that IRF9 and STAT2 nuclear translocation upon IFNα treatment (Figure 1A) is in agreement with the previous observation (Levy et al., 1989Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cytoplasmic activation of ISGF3, the positive regulator of interferon-alpha-stimulated transcription, reconstituted in vitro.Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). IFNα-mediated CBP nuclear export in HeLa cells as well as other type of cells was further documented by confocal laser microscopy analysis (Figures 1B and S1A). These findings prompted us to explore whether IFNα receptors could recruit CBP. In HeLa cells or mouse fibroblasts, CBP was associated with IFNαR2, and this association was enhanced upon IFNα treatment (Figures 1C and S1B). Similarly, IRF9 and IFNαR2 also coprecipitated (Figure 1C). It is worthwhile to note that the CBP and IFNαR2 coprecipitation was only detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, suggesting that IFNαR2 recruits CBP from the cytoplasm rather than from the nucleus (Figure S1B). The interaction between CBP and IFNαR2 detected in HeLa cells was confirmed by recovering IFNαR2 from anti-CBP precipitates prepared from 293T cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged IFNαR2 and HA-tagged CBP (Figure 1D). When IFNαR1 was cotransfected with CBP, IFNαR1 and CBP association was also detected (data not shown). In addition, both IFNαR2 and IFNαR1 were able to recruit p300 (Figures S1C and S1D). Thus, the two subunits of the IFNα receptor not only recruit JAK and STAT, as has been previously reported, but they also recruit CBP/p300 and IRF9. The cytoplasmic region of human IFNαR2 is serine rich and bears six putative proline boxes. To establish the CBP- binding domain, a series of cDNAs encoding a Myc-tagged IFNαR2 cytoplasmic region with various truncation were constructed (Figure 1E). In 293T cells, the Myc-IFNαR2 C-terminal truncation mutants were cotransfected with HA-CBP for an association analysis. Slightly enhanced CBP binding was detected when comparing the C-terminally truncated deletion construct (265–473) with the full-length C-terminal region (265–515) (Figure 1F), indicating that the C terminus of IFNαR2 bears an inhibitory regulation domain. IFNαR2 mutants interacted with CBP when the C-terminal end was truncated up to Ser392. Further truncation up to Gly335 largely disrupted the IFNαR2:CBP interaction (Figure 1F). In accord with this, while deletion of the membrane proximal region between Lys265 and Gly335 showed no apparent effect on IFNαR2:CBP interaction, further deletion up to Leu391 abrogated the IFNαR2:CBP interaction (Figure 1F). Among the phosphoserines identified by mass spectrometry (Table S1), Ser364 and Ser384 reside within the two adjacent proline box 2 and proline box 3 (P362xxxxxPxxP, P378xxPxxxP) of the region between Gly335 and Ser391. To determine the importance of serine phosphorylation on CBP interaction, we prepared serine mutated IFNαR2. While IFNαR2 mutants with S322A/S324A, S400A, or S412A/S413A substitutions retained their ability in recruiting CBP, either S364A or S384A of IFNαR2, but not with S364D or S384D substitution, largely abolished CBP recruitment (Figure 1G). Together, these results suggest that while the region from Gly335 to Ser392 is responsible for CBP binding, phosphorylation of Ser364 and Ser384 sites coordinately stabilize this binding. To gain insight into the role of cytoplasmic CBP recruitment by IFNα receptors, we examined IFNαR2 acetylation. In HeLa cells, IFNαR2 acetylation was induced by IFNα treatment and downregulation of CBP in HeLa cells with CBP-specific siRNA-abolished IFNαR2 acetylation in response to IFNα treatment (Figure 2A), suggesting that CBP is responsible for IFNαR2 acetylation in HeLa cells. Although p300 and IFNαR2 interaction was detected (Figure S1C), CBP was much more effective than p300 or other acetyltransferase factors at catalyzing IFNαR2 acetylation (Figure 2B, upper panel). CBP-dependent IFNαR2 acetylation could be enhanced by treating the transfectants with trichostatin A (TSA), a synthetic inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) or abolished by cotransfecting with HDAC6 (Figure 2B, bottom panel), suggesting CBP-mediated IFNαR2 acetylation is a reversible process. The IFNαR2 cytoplasmic region carries a number of species-conserved lysine sites. To identify the acetylated lysine site(s), IFNαR2 mutants were constructed, in which each of these lysine residues was changed to arginine via site-directed mutagenesis. IFNαR2-KR mutants were transfected along with CBP in 293T cells and assessed for their acetylation pattern. IFNαR2 acetylation intensity was markedly reduced with the Lys399 → Arg substitution (Figure 2C), suggesting that Lys399 may be the major acetylation site of the IFNαR2 cytoplasmic region. To confirm this finding, IFNαR2 proteins purified from IFNα-treated 293T transfectants were analyzed with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The specific peptide sequences of IFNαR2 were assigned to the mass values shown in Figure 2D by matching the measured masses with calculated mass values. Mass spectrometry analysis not only confirmed Lys399 as the unique acetylation site but also identified seven phosphorylated serine residues including Ser400 (Figure 2D and Table S1) as described in the above section. Notably, the peptides bearing acetyl-Lys399-phospho-Ser400 (Figure 2D), acetyl-Lys399 alone, and phospho-Ser400 alone (Table S1) were simultaneously recovered in the mass spectrometry analysis, indicating that Lys399 acetylation and Ser400 phosphorylation can happen either simultaneously or independently. Intriguingly, the “RRKSPL” motif of IFNαR2 is homologous to Lys9 and Lys27 of the histone H3 protein (Figure 2E). In histone H3, the “RKS” motifs are involved in protein interactions by following a “meth/phos switch” model (Fischle et al., 2005Fischle W. Tseng B.S. Dormann H.L. Ueberheide B.M. Garcia B.A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Funabiki H. Allis C.D.

This raises the possibility that the dual-mark combination of acetyl-Lys399phospho-Ser400 serves as a better protein-protein interaction module for signal transduction. To explore the consequence of IFNαR2 acetylation in signal transduction, we analyzed STAT and IRF9 recruitment by IFNαR2, since IFNαR2 could recruit not only STAT2 but also IRF9 ( Figures 3A and 1C). To identify the IRF9 docking site in IFNαR2, truncation mutations of IFNαR2 cytoplasmic domain were tested for IRF9 binding. C-terminally truncated IFNαR2 (265–408) interacted with IRF9 with no apparent binding defect (Figure 3B, left panel). After further truncation up to Ser392 (265–392), the interaction with IRF9 was disrupted (Figure 3B, left panel) without apparently affecting its interaction with STAT2 (Figure 3B, right panel). Hence, the 16-residue fragment from Ser392 to Glu408 of the IFNαR2 cytoplasmic domain, which bears Lys399 and Ser400, should be specifically responsible for IRF9 binding. To estimate Lys399/Ser400 modification in IRF9 recruitment, we constructed IFNαR2 with Lys399 and/or Ser400 mutations. IFNαR2-K399R reduced its interaction with IRF9 (Figure 3C). Interestingly, a slightly enhanced interaction between IFNαR2-S400A mutant and IRF9 was repeatedly observed (Figure 3C). When both K399R and S400A were introduced, however, the activity of IFNαR2 in IRF9 interaction was severely affected (Figure 3C). Mass spectrometry showed that IFNαR2 was phosphorylated on Ser322, Ser324, Ser412, and Ser413. A Ser → Ala substitution of these sites did not apparently affect the association of IFNαR2 and IRF9 (Figure S2). To confirm the view that the acetyl-Lys399 or an acetyl-Lys399-phospho-Ser400 motif is required for IRF9 binding, synthesized peptides containing the flanking sequence of Lys399/Ser400 were immobilized at three doses on nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins prepared from control or Myc-IRF9 transfected 293T cells were incubated with these peptide membranes then followed by anti-Myc probing. Only the peptides bearing acetyl-Lys399 and acetyl-Lys399-phospho-Ser400 interacted with IRF9 (Figure 3D). Consistently, IFNα failed to induce the interaction between IFNαR2 and IRF9 (Figure 3E) or IRF9 nuclear translocation (data not shown) in CBP−/− mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF). IFNα stimulation dependent IRF9 acetylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA-binding activity were restored by expressing wild-type IFNαR2 but not by expressing IFNαR2-K399R mutant in IFNαR2 null U5A cells (Figure 3F). These findings clearly demonstrate that CBP is responsible for IFNαR2 acetylation. Moreover, while IFNαR2 acetylation of Lys399 is sufficient for IRF9 recruitment, phosphorylation of the neighboring serine site (Ser400) further stabilizes the interaction between these two proteins. We next analyzed the domain of IRF9 responsible for the interaction with IFNαR2. The IRF9 C-terminal region can be further divided into three domains according to secondary structural analysis (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/∼3dpssm/index2.html): (1) the IRF homology1 domain (IH1D) or transcriptional activation domain (340–393) consists of a “βα” (or “βαα” in other IRF members) secondary structure; (2) the IRF homology2 (IH2) domain (258–339) consists of four β sheets sandwiched by two helices, “αββββα,” similar to the SH2 domain (Figure 4A); and (3) the IRF homology3 (IH3) domain (200–257) consists of four short β sheets “ββββ.” To identify which of these C-terminal domains is required for IFNαR2 binding, we prepared a series of Myc-tagged IRF9 domain deletion mutants (Figure 4B) and cotransfected them with IFNαR2 in 293T cells. Coimmunoprecipitation results indicate that the IH2 domain (258–393) bears the major interaction site for IFNαR2, even though a weak interaction between the N-terminal DBD (1–117) and IFNαR2 was observed (Figure 4C). Deletion of the C-terminal IH1 domain (339–393) disrupted IRF9 interaction with STAT2 (Figure 4D). Given that the β5 and β6 motifs of the IH2 domain appear as the swapped βB and βC motifs in the SH2 domain (Figure 4A), we tested the significance of Arg292 of the IH2 domain for IFNαR2 binding. IRF9 with Arg292 → Gln substitution dramatically inhibited the IRF9 interaction with IFNαR2 (Figure 4E). Although conserved aromatic residues of the bromodomain often interact with the acetylated lysine site through amide-π interaction, substitution of conserved aromatic residues with alanine (IRF9-W300A, IRF9-F323F328A) did not affect IFNαR2 binding (Figure 4E). Together, these findings support the notion that the IH2 domain of IRF9 is responsible for the modular interaction with IFNαR2, whereas the IH1 domain of IRF9 is for STAT2 recruitment. Like IFNαR2, IRF9 acetylation was inducible upon IFNα treatment in HeLa cells but not in the HeLa cells with CBP downregulated (Figure 5A). CBP was also the most effective one among the acetyltransferases tested for catalyzing IRF9 acetylation in 293T cells (Figure 5B). For some IRF family members, the acetylated lysine sites have been exclusively identified within the N-terminal DBD (Figure S2B). To identify the acetylated lysine sites of IRF9, we mutated all conserved lysine sites within the IRF9 N-terminal domain. Surprisingly, in IRF9 null U2A cells, K → R mutagenic analysis of the IRF9 acetylation pattern did not provide any information regarding which lysine is acetylated by CBP because none of the IRF9-KR mutants appeared impaired by acetylation as accessed by blotting analysis (Figure 5C). Several IRF9-KR mutants became more sensitive to acetylation by CBP (Figure 5C), suggesting that IRF9 can be hypo- or hyperacetylated. When mass spectrometry was employed, eight acetylated peptides were recovered from IRF9 (Figure 5D). All acetylated lysine sites that reside within the N-terminal domain and are highly conserved in IRF9 through different species. When aligned with other IRF family members, however, Lys81, the helix-α3 lysine, is the only one conserved among all members (Figure S2B). In IRF2 and IRF7, the helix-α3 lysine (Lys78 and Lys92, respectively) is the major acetylation site and is thought to regulate DNA-binding activity (Caillaud et al., 2002Caillaud A. Prakash A. Smith E. Masumi A. Hovanessian A.G. Levy D.E. Marie I. Acetylation of interferon regulatory factor-7 by p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP)-associated factor (PCAF) impairs its DNA binding.J. Biol.

Interferon regulatory factor-2 regulates cell growth through its acetylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25401-25407Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine an effect of IRF9 acetylation on DNA binding, we cotransfected either wild-type IRF9 or IRF9-KR mutants with CBP into U2A cells and performed EMSA using whole-cell extracts and a 32P-labled ISRE oligonucleotide from the ISG15 gene promoter. IRF9-K81R virtually abolished its DNA-binding activity (Figure 5E). Three-dimensional and protein-interaction analysis revealed that the N-terminal DBD and the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain in a latent IRF molecule are either in contact or in close proximity and that dimerization is required for IRF to bind to DNA (Brass et al., 1996Brass A.L. Kehrli E. Eisenbeis C.F. Storb U. Singh H.

Crystal structure of IRF-3 reveals mechanism of autoinhibition and virus-induced phosphoactivation.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It was tempting to speculate that IRF9 acetylation on Lys81 was needed for IRF9 to undergo dimerization within two different domains. Coimmunoprecipitation results revealed that IRF-DBD but not IRF9-DBD with K81R substitution associated with IRF9 either full-length or the C-terminal 118–393 fragment (Figure 5F, right panel). Thus, helix-α3 lysine acetylation plays a pivotal role in IRF dimerization, requiring an interaction between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. STAT2 is another important component of ISGF3 complex, and its acetylation was similar to IFNαR2 and IRF9 acetylation in many respects: CBP downregulation largely abolished STAT2 acetylation induction by IFNα (Figure 6A), and CBP was more potent than transferases tested in catalyzing STAT2 acetylation (Figure 6B). Mass spectrometry identified nine acetylated lysine sites within STAT2 proteins prepared from 293T cells cotransfected with STAT2 and CBP or p300. While four acetyl-lysine sites reside within the β-barrel DBD (Figure 6C), others reside within the coiled coil and the SH2 domains (Table S2). Interestingly, and differing from IRF, acetylated lysine sites are poorly conserved among STAT members (Figure 6D). To investigate the effect of STAT2 acetylation on ISGF3 complex formation, we started with the N-terminal coiled-coil domain. In agreement with previous publications (Horvath et al., 1996Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Interactions between STAT and non-STAT proteins in the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 transcription complex.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, Martinez-Moczygemba et al., 1997Martinez-Moczygemba M. Gutch M.J. French D.L. Reich N.C. Distinct STAT structure promotes interaction of STAT2 with the p48 subunit of the interferon-alpha-stimulated transcription factor ISGF3.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20070-20076Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), this domain of STAT2 (1–314) and IRF9 coprecipitated (Figure S3A). However, acetylation within the coiled-coil domain did not seem to be involved in this regulatory interaction since a K → R substitution of the four acetylated sites within this domain did not alter the STAT2:IRF9 interaction (Figures S3B and S3C). We then examined STAT2 acetylation within the β-barrel DBD. A direct interaction between the STAT2-DBD (315–485) and STAT1 was detected (Figure 6E) (Li et al., 1997Li X. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Functional subdomains of STAT2 required for preassociation with the alpha interferon receptor and for signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). While STAT2 with a K384R or K419R substitution moderately weakened the STAT2 and STAT1 interactions, STAT2-K390R and to a lesser extent STAT2-K415R interacted more strongly with STAT1 (Figure 6F, left panel). Among these acetylated sites within the β-barrel DBD, Lys390 is least conserved. Lys390 from STAT2 of human origin was replaced by glutamate in STAT2 of murine origin (Figure S3D). STAT2 with a K390E substitution restored the pattern of the interaction between STAT2 and STAT1 observed with wild-type STAT2 (Figure 6G). STAT1 also bears a negatively charged residue (Glu394) at the same position (Figure 6D). However, STAT1 with both E393 and E394 changed to alanine showed no effect on the elevated interaction between STAT1 and STAT2-K390R (Figure 6G). In contrast, STAT2 DBD acetylation seemed to be irrelevant to STAT2's interaction with IRF9 (Figure 6F, right panel) or STAT3, which can also form heterodimer with STAT2 (Figure S3E). These findings imply that endogenous STAT1 and STAT2 in human cells might form a heterodimer prior to cytokine treatment. Indeed, we repeatedly detected a stable STAT1:STAT2 interaction, which was slightly diminished following IFNα treatment in HeLa cells (Figure 6H). To estimate STAT2-K390R mutant on ISGF3 complex formation, Myc-tagged forms of IRF9 and STAT1 were cotransfected with Myc-tagged STAT2 wild-type or K390R mutant in STAT2 null U6A cells. STAT1 precipitates prepared from these transfectants were blotted with either STAT2 antibody or IRF9 antibody, and their blotting signal intensities were plotted in arbitrary units (Figure 6I). Even though K390R mutated STAT2 became avidly bound to STAT1 (Figure 6I, left), lesser amount of IRF9 was recovered from STAT1 precipitants obtained from U6A cells expressing STAT2-K390R mutant (Figure 6I, right). Although STAT1 was also acetylated (Kramer et al., 2006Kramer O"
https://openalex.org/W1964252337,"An ERG gene 'break-apart' fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay has been used to screen whole-mount prostatectomy specimens for rearrangements at the ERG locus. In cancers containing ERG alterations the observed pattern of changes was often complex. Different categories of ERG gene alteration were found either together in a single cancerous region or within separate foci of cancer in the same prostate slice. In some cases the juxtaposition of particular patterns of ERG alterations suggested possible mechanisms of tumour progression. Prostates harbouring ERG alterations commonly also contained cancer that lacked rearrangements of the ERG gene. A single trans-urethral resection of the prostate specimen examined harboured both ERG and ETV1 gene rearrangements demonstrating that the observed complexity may, at least in part, be explained by multiple ETS gene alterations arising independently in a single prostate. In a search for possible precursor lesions clonal ERG rearrangements were found both in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and in atypical in situ epithelial lesions consistent with the diagnosis of low grade PIN. Our observations support the view that ERG gene alterations represent an initiating event that promotes clonal expansion initially to form regions of epithelial atypia. The complex patterns of ERG alteration found in prostatectomy specimens have important implications for the design of experiments investigating the clinical significance and mechanism of development of individual prostate cancers."

We conclude that iPLA2γ is essential for maintaining efficient bioenergetic mitochondrial function through tailoring mitochondrial membrane lipid metabolism and composition.

Through the precisely regulated partitioning of energy derived from substrates between ATP synthesis and heat production, a finely tuned dynamic balance is maintained to promote organism survival. In addition, excess energy derived from substrates, not immediately needed to fulfill chemical or thermodynamic demands, is directed into the production of lipid synthetic intermediates for energy storage (e.g. mitochondrial synthesis of lysophosphatidic acid, a precursor of triglycerides). Moreover, mitochondria generate diverse chemical signals that reflect the bioenergetic status of the cell (e.g. NO and cytochrome c) and thus integrate multiple energetic, metabolic, and signaling cascades (1Goldenthal M.J.

To gain further insight into the role of iPLA2γ in cardiac function, we inactivated the iPLA2γ gene in mice by targeted deletion of exon 5 encoding the lipase active site (GVSTG). Genetic ablation of iPLA2γ resulted in growth retardation, cold intolerance, and dramatically reduced exercise endurance. The importance of iPLA2γ in the ability of myocardium to respond to stress was identified by the dramatically reduced survival of iPLA2γ knock-out mice following transverse aortic constriction. Finally, mitochondrial function assays in mice null for iPLA2γ demonstrated markedly decreased complex IV function that was associated with decreases in tetra-18:2 cardiolipin content. Collectively, these studies identify mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from alterations in mitochondrial lipid metabolism as the mechanistic basis for the phenotypic features of mice null for iPLA2γ.

This fragment was cloned into the corresponding site of vector pPNT (31Tybulewicz V.L. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) upstream of the neomycin gene sequence. Similarly, a 1055-nt PCR fragment amplified utilizing primers P3 and P4 (Table 1) and corresponding to sequence 3′ of exon 6 was cloned into XhoI and NotI restriction sites downstream of the neomycin gene sequence. This generated a construct containing iPLA2γ genomic sequence, for which exon 5 was replaced with the positive selection marker (neomycin in the opposite orientation) and leaving regions of homology on either side of the neomycin gene. An SfiI restriction site within the plasmid construct containing the iPLA2γ was used for linearization. The linearized construct was electroporated into male SCC#10 ES cells (derived from 129X1Sv/J mice; Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME)) for subsequent neomycin selection using G418. Homologous recombinants were identified by Southern blot analysis and tail PCR. For genomic Southern blot analysis, PstI restriction site differences between wild type (WT) and KO mouse genomic DNA sequence were utilized for detection of 7.4-kb WT and 5.9-kb KO iPLA2γ bands by hybridization with a 459-nt genomic probe generated by PCR amplification with primers P5 and P6 (Table 1). Two clones of 238 screened by Southern analysis were positive for the homologous recombination. These clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, followed by implantation into pseudopregnant mice to generate the chimeric mouse founder line utilizing the Neurosciences Transgenic Core facility at Washington University. Chimeras were mated to C57BL6/J mice, and germ line transmission to heterozygous offspring was confirmed by Southern blotting of tail DNA. Interbreeding of heterozygous offspring was used to generate homozygous KO and WT littermates used in all studies. In addition to genomic Southern analysis, tail PCR was routinely performed for genotyping. “Neoforward” and “Common REV” primers (Table 1) were utilized for amplification of a 354-nt product from the knock-out allele, whereas paired “iPLA2 FOR” and “Common REV” primers (Table 1) were utilized to amplify a 181-nt product for detection of the wild type allele. All experiments were performed using sex- and age-matched littermate controls as noted.TABLE 1Primers for construction and genotyping of the iPLA2 γ knock-outPrimersSequence (5′-3′)iPLA2 γ KO primers P1AAAAGAATTCAGGCAGAGGAGAAAAAGCGTGTGCTACTTC P2AAAAGAATTCGCTCACAACCATCCGTAATGAGATCTGGATG P3AAAACTCGAGCCAAGAACATGCAGCACAGGCTTGAGGCCAT P4AAAAGCGGCCGCTTGTTGACATCATAAAAACCATAATT P5CTCTATCGAAAGTTGGGCTCAGATGT P6AATAGGTAAATAAATACTAAAATGGATail PCR primer set NEO forwardAAAGGCCTACCCGCTTCCATTGCTCA Common REVGCCTCAAGCCTGTGCTGCATGTTCTT iPLA2 γ FORCTGTTCACAGAGGTGTGGTTGC KO band = 354 base pairs WT band = 181 base pairsReverse transcription-PCR primers 1CAAGAAGGCAGAGGAGAAAAAGC 2CCCAAAGCTCTGTATTACTAGGG 3GATTACATCTGTGGAGTAAGCACAGGG 4CGTGAAAGGCCAAGGCCGAAGGG 5AGTGAGCATTCATATGTCCCG 6CGGAGAATGACTCTCCAAATCTG GAPDH FTGTTGCCATCAATGACCCCTTCA GAPDH RTGATGATCTTGAGGCTGTTGTC Open table in a new tab General Animal Studies—Animal protocols were in strict accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for humane treatment of animals and were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care Committee of Washington University. Conscious animals fed ad libitum were weighed at various time points after weaning up to 10 months of age. Following euthanasia, tissues were dissected from male and female mice, weighed, and expressed as a fraction of total body weight. Rectal temperature was measured to the nearest 0.1 °C by inserting the probe of a thermocouple (Fisher) 20 mm into the rectum until a stable reading was obtained. For these temperature studies, mice were singly housed at ambient temperature with food and water provided ad libitum, and the mean of temperatures taken at 8 a.m. on three consecutive days was reported. For cold tolerance studies, male and female WT and KO mice were singly housed at 4 °C for up to 24 h with food and water provided ad libitum. For cold adaptation studies, core body temperatures were monitored utilizing a rectal probe at time 0 and hourly thereafter with constant monitoring of mice for signs of lethargy. Mice were removed from the study when their core temperature dropped below 28 °C. For food intake studies, ad libitum food intake of individually housed mice was measured at 1, 1.5, 4, and 9 months of age (n = 4) over a period of 3–5 consecutive days. RNA, DNA, and Protein Analyses—For Northern blotting, total RNA was isolated utilizing an RNeasy tissue kit, and hybridizations were performed as previously described (8Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Sims H.F. Cohen J.M. Yang J. Gross R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4709-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), utilizing labeled ∼1-kb iPLA2γ probe derived from IMAGE clone 6591346 (ATCC, Manassas, VA). For quantitative PCR analyses, total RNA was isolated from tissues using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE). cDNA was synthesized from RNA using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA samples were amplified using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on the ABI 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Acidic ribosomal protein 36B4 message was used for normalization, and results were analyzed using the comparative Ct method. Primers used for quantitative PCR were as follows (5′–3′): UCP1, CTCACTCAGGATTGGCCTCTA (forward) and TCTGACCTTCACGACCTCTGTA (reverse); UCP2, TCCACGCAGCCTCTACAAT (forward) and GACCTTTACCACATCTGTAGGC (reverse); UCP3, CAGAGGGACTATGGATGCCTAC (forward) and AGGTGAGACTCCAGCAACTTCT (reverse); 36B4, GCAGACAACGTGGGCTCCAAGCAGAT (forward) and GGTCCTCCTTGGTGAACACGAAGCCC (reverse). Results were analyzed by comparing the threshold crossing (Ct) of each sample after normalization to the control genes (dCt). The changes in the threshold crossing (dCt) were used to calculate the relative levels of each mRNA from the various samples using the formula 2–dCt. Genomic Southern blot studies were performed by PstI digestion of 10 mg of genomic DNA, followed by electrophoreses on a 0.8% TAE gel and transfer to a Hybond-XL (GE Life Sciences) membrane for hybridization. Western blotting was performed as previously described (28Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) utilizing an ECL detection system (GE Life Sciences). Treadmill Studies—Treadmill studies were performed utilizing the Mouse Cardiovascular Phenotyping Core at Washington University School of Medicine. WT and knock-out mice (ages ∼2–9 months) were run to exhaustion utilizing a motorized, speed-controlled, modular treadmill system (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) equipped with an electric shock stimulus and an adjustable inclination angle as previously described (32Leone T.C. Lehman J.J. Finck B.N. Schaeffer P.J. Wende A.R. Boudina S. Courtois M. Wozniak D.F. Sambandam N. Bernal-Mizrachi C. Chen Z. Holloszy J.O. Medeiros D.M. Schmidt R.E. Saffitz J.E. Abel E.D. Semenkovich C.F. Kelly D.P. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e101Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Runs were performed on a level inclination, and running velocity was initiated at 10 m/min and then incrementally increased at a rate of 3 m/min until exhaustion, defined as the inability to remain on the treadmill for 5 s. Transverse Aortic Constriction—Transverse Aortic Constriction studies were performed by the Mouse Cardiovascular Phenotyping Core at the Washington University School of Medicine. The protocol for transverse aortic constriction (TAC) has been previously described (33Rockman H.A. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U. Steinhelper M.E. Field L.J. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8277-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 34Xing H. Zhang S. Weinheimer C. Kovacs A. Muslin A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In brief, surgery was performed on mice anesthetized with a xylazine (16 mg/kg) and ketamine (80 mg/kg) mixture, and a 7–0 silk suture was placed around the transverse aorta and tied around a 25-gauge blunt needle, which was subsequently removed. Following constriction, the gradient across the band was measured to ensure that adequate stenosis had been achieved. Subsequently, the thorax was closed, and mice were allowed to recover on a heating pad until responsive to stimuli. Surgeons were blinded to mouse genotypes. As controls, sham-operated animals underwent identical surgery but without aortic constriction. Mitochondrial Respiration Studies—Mitochondria were prepared essentially as previously described (35Ricci J.E. Gottlieb R.A. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 36Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics.Vol. 3. Academic Press, Inc., London2001Google Scholar). Hearts were removed from WT and knock-out animals and immediately placed at 10% (w/v) into ice-cold pH 7 HEPES buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 250 mm sucrose. Hearts were homogenized with a loose fitting dounce homogenizer. Next, the homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to remove cellular debris, nuclei, and connective tissue. The supernatant solution was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 35 min to isolate mitochondria, which were resuspended in homogenization buffer. Protein concentration was determined using the micro-BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically using a dual channel Instech dissolved oxygen measuring system. In the presence of malate and succinate, O2 consumption was initiated with ADP to determine substrate-supported O2 consumption and ability to generate ATP. Cytochrome oxidase activity, after the addition of rotenone, was determined by the addition of ascorbate and TMPD. The addition of azide completely abolished oxygen uptake in the rotenone-inhibited preparation. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of CL—Enhanced shotgun lipidomics analyses of CL were performed on a QqQ mass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray ion source as previously described (26Han X. Yang K. Yang J. Cheng H. Gross R.W. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 864-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analyses of lipids were conducted by direct infusion employing a Harvard syringe pump at a flow rate of 4 μl/min. Typically, a 1-min period of signal averaging was employed for each mass spectrum, and a 2-min period of signal averaging was employed for each tandem mass spectrometric spectrum. A mass resolution of 0.4 Thomson was employed for acquisition of mass spectra with a QqQ instrument. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t test, χ test, one-way analysis of variance (for treadmill studies), and the log-rank test (for TAC studies). Differences were regarded as significant at p < 0.05. All data are reported as the mean ± S.E. unless otherwise noted. Targeted Disruption of the iPLA2γ Gene—Since iPLA2γ has multiple promoters and splice variants (8Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Sims H.F. Cohen J.M. Yang J. Gross R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4709-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 28Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we employed a knock-out strategy targeting the ablation of exon 5, which contains the active site. A neomycin-based gene-targeting vector was designed to undergo homologous recombination, leading to deletion of exon 5 of the murine iPLA2γ gene. The strategy for the targeting event employed to effect homologous recombination and the multiple methods used for its identification are shown in Fig. 1A. First, a linearized vector was used to electroporate SCC#10 ES cells (derived from 129X1/SvJ mice) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After neomycin selection, colonies were screened for targeted disruption of exon 5 by Southern blot analyses. Of the 238 ES clones identified possessing the neomycin resistance cassette, two independent clones (clones 7 and 48) exhibited evidence of the desired insertion/recombination event. These clones were separately injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and implanted into pseudopregnant females as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Male chimeras (10 chimerics from clone 7 and 1 chimeric from clone 48) whose coat color ranged from 50 to 100% agouti were subsequently bred with C57BL/6 mice. Heterozygotes originating from clone 7 were used for the subsequent generation of all mice. Breeding of C57BL/6 mice containing the insert from clone 7 led to the generation of viable mice null for the iPLA2γ gene as demonstrated by both tail PCR analyses and genomic Southern analyses (Fig. 1B). Further characterization of the targeting strategy for the disruption of the iPLA2γ gene demonstrated that the ablation of exon 5 resulted in an unstable transcript, since multiple different regions of the gene could not be detected by reverse transcription-PCR analyses (Fig. 1C) and Northern blot analyses of mRNA purified from heart and other tissues in iPLA2γ KO mice did not demonstrate any message corresponding to the altered transcript (Fig. 1D). Targeted disruption of the iPLA2γ active site resulted in over a 60% reduction in the production of 2-[14C]arachidonoyl LPC from 1-palmitoyl 2-[14C]arachidonoyl-PC in incubations with mitochondrial homogenates prepared from mice null for iPLA2γ (Fig. 2). The marked reduction in this “signature” reaction of iPLA2γ substantiates the targeted ablation of iPLA2γ activity. The remaining measurable mitochondrial phospholipase activity was probably largely due to iPLA2β, since it was inhibitable by BEL, and substantive amounts of iPLA2β are known to be present in murine mitochondria (7Gadd M.E. Broekemeier K.M. Crouser E.D. Kumar J. Graff G. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6931-6939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Williams S.D. Gottlieb R.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition, iPLA2β can hydrolyze the sn-1-position of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl choline glycerophospholipids, albeit at much slower rates and with less regiospecificity in comparison with iPLA2γ (12Yan W. Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Sims H.F. Yang K. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26669-26679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It should be noted that small amounts of a calcium-independent activity that was not inhibitable by BEL were also present in both WT and iPLA2 γ–/– murine mitochondria. This activity probably results from cPLA2γ that is localized in the mitochondrial compartment and is both calcium-independent and not inhibitable by BEL (37Stewart A. Ghosh M. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29526-29536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results support the conclusion that the gene-targeting event resulted in an iPLA2γ null allele and that iPLA2 γ–/– mice were viable. General Phenotypic Features of Mice Null for iPLA2γ—Subsequent large scale breeding of heterozygous mice resulted in normal litter sizes with no unexpected deaths of offspring. Genotypic analyses of 751 offspring from heterozygous crosses resulted in 201 WT, 395 heterozygous, and 155 homozygous KO offspring, indicating a small (17%) reduction in the expected Mendelian inheritance of the homozygous KO (0.89: 2.26:1.15 versus the expected 1:2:1 ratio (p < 0.02 by the χ test). Most of the reduction was due to the lower proportion of female KO mice (71 versus the expected 94), a 24% reduction in anticipated female offspring (p < 0.05). Although iPLA2γ knock-out mice appeared normal and healthy after birth and weaning by visual inspection, body weights of iPLA2γ KO mice were consistently 9% lower compared with sex-matched WT littermates (8.78 ± 0.4 versus 10.95 ± 0.2 g, respectively, at 28 days of age (p < 0.01)) and remained lower through approximately day 50 (Fig. 3A). In contrast to their WT littermates, which progressively increased in weight, mice null for iPLA2γ did not gain significant weight after adolescence. By day 288, KO male animals had a mean weight of 22.2 ± 0.4 g versus 34.1 ± 3.1 g for WT males (i.e. 3"

The full-length NS3 protein contains two functional modules, both of which are essential in the life cycle of HCV: a serine protease domain at the N terminus and an ATPase/helicase domain (NS3hel) at the C terminus. Truncated NS3hel constructs have been studied extensively; the ATPase, nucleic acid binding, and helicase activities have been examined and NS3hel has been used as a target in the development of antivirals. However, a comprehensive comparison of NS3 and NS3hel activities has not been performed, so it remains unclear whether the protease domain plays a vital role in NS3 helicase function. Given that many DEXH/D-box proteins are activated upon interaction with cofactor proteins, it is important to establish if the protease domain acts as the cofactor for stimulating NS3 helicase function. Here we show that the protease domain greatly enhances both the direct and functional binding of RNA to NS3. Whereas electrostatics plays an important role in this process, there is a specific allosteric contribution from the interaction interface between NS3hel and the protease domain. Most importantly, we establish that the protease domain is required for RNA unwinding by NS3. Our results suggest that, in addition to its role in cleavage of host and viral proteins, the NS3 protease domain is essential for the process of viral RNA replication and, given its electrostatic contribution to RNA binding, it may also assist in packaging of the viral RNA.

Nonstructural protein (NS3) 3The abbreviations used are: NS3, non-structural protein 3; HCV, hepatitis C virus; NS3hel, NS3 helicase domain; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. is an essential component of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication complex. It is a nucleic acid-stimulated ATPase and DEXH/D-box protein that is structurally similar to other DNA and RNA helicases from the phylogenetically conserved superfamily 2. Like these relatives, NS3 contains two RecA fold domains (domains 1 and 2) that comprise the ATPase site and the platform for RNA binding, which is supplemented by domain 3, which sits atop D1 and D2 (1Yao N. Reichert P. Taremi S.S. Prosise W.W. Weber P.C. Structure. 1999; 7: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The three-lobed triangle comprised of D1–D3 is considered the “helicase” of NS3 (NS3hel), and it has been studied extensively in isolation (2Frick D.N. Rypma R.S. Lam A.M. Gu B. J. Biol.

However, the full-length NS3 protein differs from other SF2 helicases in that it possesses a fourth domain at the N terminus that displays robust serine protease activity (the protease domain) (6Yao N. Hesson T. Cable M. Hong Z. Kwong A.D. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 7Failla C. Tomei L. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3753-3760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protease domain is located at the vertices of D1–D3, in an ideal location to influence the catalytic activities of the helicase region. NS3 serine protease activity is crucial for cleaving the viral polyprotein into individual, nonstructural (NS) proteins. It also facilitates viral pathogenicity by cleaving host proteins and down-regulating the innate immune response of the cell (7Failla C. Tomei L. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3753-3760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Meylan E. Curran J. Hofmann K. Moradpour D. Binder M. Bartenschlager R. Tschopp J. Nature. 2005; 437: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar). NS3 helicase activity may be required to assist the viral polymerase during replication of the HCV RNA genome. NS3 may unwind complex RNA structures within the genome, whereas the NS5B viral polymerase copies the RNA (9Piccininni S. Varaklioti A. Nardelli M. Dave B. Raney K.D. McCarthy J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45670-45679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). There may also be a role for NS3 in viral capsid assembly and the packaging of the RNA genome within (10Yi M. Ma Y. Yates J. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, a specific function for the helicase has not yet been clearly demonstrated. NS3hel constructs have been extensively studied, and analyses of ATPase activity, nucleic acid binding, and duplex unwinding have been reported (2Frick D.N. Rypma R.S. Lam A.M. Gu B. J. Biol.

Moreover, NS3hel has been used to test potential anti-HCV compounds (13Borowski P. Deinert J. Schalinski S. Bretner M. Ginalski K. Kulikowski T. Shugar D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, much of the previous work comparing NS3hel with the full-length NS3 protein has been performed on DNA (2Frick D.N. Rypma R.S. Lam A.M. Gu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1269-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Zhang C. Cai Z. Kim Y.C. Kumar R. Yuan F. Shi P.Y. Kao C. Luo G. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1269-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A diverse array of NS3 constructs has been utilized, and in many cases the proteins were appended to positively charged histidine tags (2Frick D.N. Rypma R.S. Lam A.M. Gu B. J. Biol.

To develop a clear understanding of the protease domain and its influence on activities of the NS3 helicase, we set out to do a comparative analysis of full-length NS3 (which preserves the protease domain) and a diversity of truncated NS3hel constructs. Understanding the role of the protease domain is not only important for gaining mechanistic insights into the viral life cycle. It is also important for the field of helicase enzymology, as cofactors frequently enhance the re-modeling activities of DEXH/D proteins. For example, RhlB ATPase activity is greatly stimulated by the presence of ribonuclease E (15Vanzo N.F. Li Y.S. Py B. Blum E. Higgins C.F. Raynal L.C. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2770-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and Dbp5 ATPase activity and RNA binding are enhanced by Gle1 (16Weirich C.S. Erzberger J.P. Flick J.S. Berger J.M. Thorner J. Weis K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Moreover, Dbp8 ATPase activity is enhanced by Esf2 (17Granneman S. Lin C. Champion E.A. Nandineni M.R. Zorca C. Baserga S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3189-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Prp43 RNA unwinding activity is enhanced by Ntr1 (18Tanaka N. Aronova A. Schwer B. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Given these findings, we reasoned that RNA binding and unwinding by NS3hel may be enhanced by the presence of its appended protease cofactor domain. Here we show that the serine protease domain greatly enhances both the direct and functional binding of RNA to the NS3 protein. Whereas electrostatics play an important role in these processes, there is a specific allosteric contribution from the interaction interface between NS3hel and the protease domain. Most importantly, we show that the serine protease domain is required for NS3 unwinding of RNA and that NS3hel constructs are not functionally representative of NS3 behavior. Materials—RNA oligonucleotides described in this work were obtained from Dharmacon and DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. All other reagents were obtained from Fisher unless otherwise indicated. Cloning—We cloned NS3+ expressing cDNA from the hepatitis C viral genotype 1a (version H77) (kindly donated by Dr. Charlie Rice) into vectors pET15b (Novagen) and pET-SUMO (Invitrogen). For the pET15b cloning, the oligonucleotides used to amplify the NS3+ gene were: (upstream) NS3-1a-1: 5′-CCGCTCGAGGCGCCCATCACGGCGTACGC-3′ and (downstream) NS3-1a-2: 5′-CGCGGATCCTTACGTGACGACCTCCAGGTCG-3′. An internal XhoI site in the NS3+ gene was removed through a silent base pair change using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides used for the QuikChange reaction were NS3-1a-3: 5′-GGCAAGGCTATCCCCCTCGAAGTGATCAAGGGGGGA-3′ and NS3-1a-4: 5′-TCCCCCCTTGATCACTTCGAGGGGGATAGCCTTGCC-3′. The NS3+ gene was amplified and cloned into pET15b according to the methods of Beran et al. (19Beran R.K. Bruno M.M. Bowers H.A. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). NS3(1a)+ was cloned into pET-SUMO using ExTaq PCR (Takara) followed by ligation with linear pET-SUMO according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The oligonucleotides used were the same as those described above for the pET15b cloning, except that the 5′ PCR oligonucleotide was “SUMO start”: 5′-TCAGCGCCCATCACGGCGTACG-3′. NS3hel(ΔN188) and NS3hel(ΔN166) correspond to NS3 lacking 188 or 166 amino acids from its N terminus, respectively (see Fig. 1 for an NS3 map). These truncated proteins were expressed from pET-SUMO vectors (Invitrogen) as well. The gene fragments were produced using ExTaq PCR (Takara) and inserted into pET-SUMO according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The PCR oligonucleotides used to prepare pET-SUMO-NS3hel(ΔN188)+ were: Upper 1 primer 5′-TCCTCTCCACCAGCAGTGCCCCAG-3′ and Lower primer 5′-TTACGTGACGACCTCCAGGTCGG-3′. For pET-SUMO-NS3hel(ΔN166)+, Upper 2 primer 5′-TCTGTGGACTTTATCCCTGTGGA-3′ was used. To produce His-tagged versions of NS3hel(ΔN188) and NS3hel(ΔN166), we cloned the appropriate regions of the NS3+ gene into pET15b (Novagen). For our pET15b-NS3hel(ΔN188)+ and pET15b-NS3hel(ΔN166)+ constructs, we designed PCR oligonucleotides the same as Upper 1 primer, Upper 2 primer, and Lower primer, except that an XhoI site was added to the 5′-end of Upper 1 (CCGCTCGAG) and a BamHI site was added to the 5′-end of Lower primer (CGCGGATCC). The PCR products generated using these primers were digested and inserted into pET15b as described previously (19Beran R.K. Bruno M.M. Bowers H.A. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified initially through PCR screening as necessary and subsequently sequenced for accuracy (Keck Facility, Yale University). Protein Purification—All proteins were purified according to the nickel column/gel-filtration procedure described in Beran et al. (19Beran R.K. Bruno M.M. Bowers H.A. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) except that in all cases yield was increased by adding Triton X-100 to the purification buffers. 2% Triton X-100 (final concentration (v/v)) was added to purification buffer A and 0.2% Triton X-100 (final concentration (v/v)) was added to buffers B, C, and D. The His6-SUMO fusion proteins were treated with SUMO protease to create untagged protein as previously described (19Beran R.K. Bruno M.M. Bowers H.A. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Helicase Assays—Unwinding assays were performed and analyzed using a gel-shift assay essentially as previously described (14Pang P.S. Jankowsky E. Planet P.J. Pyle A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 19Beran R.K. Bruno M.M. Bowers H.A. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 nm protein and 0.2 nm duplex substrate were preincubated in a volume of 100 μl containing 25 mm MOPS-NH+4 (pH 6.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 1% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100 (v/v). After 1 h of preincubation at 37 °C, 6 μl of preincubation mixture were added to 2 μl of ATP/trap mixture (25 mm MOPS-NH+4 (pH 6.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 1 μm top-strand oligonucleotide, 16 mm ATP) such that the final concentration of ATP during each reaction was 4 mm. The unwinding substrate used was RNA 12/30, an RNA duplex with a 12-base pair duplex and an 18-nucleotide 3′-overhang (14Pang P.S. Jankowsky E. Planet P.J. Pyle A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Filter Binding Assays—Filter binding assays were used to determine the affinity for the various NS3 constructs with various RNAs. The RNA oligonucleotides used in this assay were TS34 (the 34-mer “top strand” RNA oligonucleotide of the unwinding substrate RNA 1 (19Beran R.K. Bruno M.M. Bowers H.A. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar): 5′-CUGUGGCAUGUCCUAGCGUCGUAUCGAUCUGGUC-3′, the 98-mer bottom strand of duplex RNA VS1 (20Serebrov V. Pyle A.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar): 5′-GGGAGUGUGAGGAACUGUUCGGGAGACCUGGAGGCCAGCAGUCGCAAGGCAGAGUACACUAGUCCGAACGUAGUGCUCCCAGGAGCUCAGCUAUCAGA-3′, and poly(U) 34-mer: 5′-UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-3′. These RNA oligonucleotides were 5′-end labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (150 μCi/μl, 6000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the enzyme manufacturer's instructions. The labeled RNA oligonucleotides were electrophoresed on a 15% acrylamide, 8 m urea gel, visualized using an InstantImager (PerkinElmer), excised from the gel, and eluted with shaking for 4 h at 4 °C in 300 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2). After isopropyl alcohol precipitation, the labeled RNA oligonucleotides were quantified using a scintillation counter (Beckman). The filter binding assays were performed essentially according to Wong and Lohman (21Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In our case, we incubated various concentrations of protein in a volume of 100 μl for 1 h with 0.2 nm labeled RNA oligonucleotide at 37 °C in NS3 helicase assay buffer (25 mm MOPS-NH+4 (pH 6.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 1% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100 (v/v)) before loading onto a membrane sandwich. The membrane sandwich was composed of a top layer of nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm) (Pierce) and a bottom layer of Nytran N nylon membrane (0.2 micron) (Whatman). We loaded 50 μl of each incubation mixture per lane on a dot-blot apparatus while a vacuum was being applied. We subsequently washed the samples in each lane using 150 μl of ice-cold NS3 helicase assay buffer while a vacuum was being applied. The blots were exposed to a phosphorimager plate for 1 h before being scanned by a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). The percentage of the total RNA bound to protein was subsequently calculated. The RNA binding data were fit to the Hill equation (Ys = [S]n/Kd + [S]n) (22Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry.2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995Google Scholar) using SigmaPlot (Systat Software). ATPase Assays—ATPase assays were performed at 37 °C using 20-μl reactions composed of 30 nm protein suspended in NS3 helicase assay buffer (25 mm MOPS-NH+4 (pH 6.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 1% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100 (v/v)) containing varying amounts of TS34 RNA oligonucleotide, and ∼1 mm ATP final concentration. The ATP used in these reactions was prepared by mixing 4 μl of 100 mm ATP (Promega) with 35 μl of water and 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (150 μCi/μl, 6000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer). 2 μl of this ATP mixture was added to each incubation mixture to fill them to 20 μl total. All tubes with protein and RNA were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h before the addition of the ATP mixture and the subsequent reactions were also incubated at this same temperature. 1 μl of each reaction was spotted after the appropriate incubation times along an axis 1 inch from the bottom of a thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate (Analtech). After the spots dried, the TLC plates were placed in a glass chamber with a lid in which the bottom 1 cm of each plate was submerged in TLC solution (1 m formic acid, 0.75 m LiCl). After about 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the TLC buffer migrated ∼10 cm up each plate. The plates were removed from the chamber at this point and allowed to air dry. The plates were subsequently exposed to a PhosphorImager plate (GE Healthcare) for 5 min before scanning with a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). The initial reaction velocities versus RNA concentration were plotted and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (v0 = (Vmax)[S]/Km + [S]) (22Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry.2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995Google Scholar) using SigmaPlot. The Serine Protease Domain Enhances Direct RNA Binding by the NS3 Helicase Domain—As a first step toward evaluating the effects of the serine protease domain on NS3 helicase activity, we examined the RNA binding affinity of full-length NS3 and compared it with helicase domain constructs that lacked the protease domain. It was necessary to create two different protease deletion constructs of the helicase domain: NS3hel(ΔN166) and NS3hel(ΔN188), which are missing 166 and 188 amino acids, respectively, from the N terminus of the NS3 protein (Fig. 1). NS3hel(ΔN166) was expressed and purified because it is the most commonly studied form of NS3hel (2Frick D.N. Rypma R.S. Lam A.M. Gu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1269-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Zhang C. Cai Z. Kim Y.C. Kumar R. Yuan F. Shi P.Y. Kao C. Luo G. J.

RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2004; 10: 1277-1290Google Scholar), thereby facilitating comparisons with previous work. However, NS3hel(ΔN166) is not a “clean” deletion of the protease domain as it retains extra N-terminal amino acids that may not fold appropriately in the truncated context (6Yao N. Hesson T. Cable M. Hong Z. Kwong A.D. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). To generate the helicase domain in isolation, we created NS3hel(ΔN188) (Fig. 1), which lacks additional N-terminal residues. All proteins used in this study were expressed and purified in the pET-SUMO system (Invitrogen) (19Beran R.K. Bruno M.M. Bowers H.A. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), which efficiently removes all non-native N-terminal amino acids and His tags after purification. Untagged proteins were essential for this study because His tags add positive charges to the NS3 N terminus, which may influence affinity for RNA. Using filter binding assays (21Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) under buffer salt conditions typical for monitoring RNA-protein interactions (see “Experimental Procedures” and Refs. 14Pang P.S.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2594-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and in the absence of ATP, we measured direct binding of the NS3 variants to a 5′-end labeled, single-stranded RNA that was 34 nucleotides in length (TS34). Whereas both NS3 and NS3hel(ΔN188) bind TS34 RNA, RNA binding by NS3hel(ΔN166) was not detectable in this assay (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Filter binding data for NS3 and NS3hel(ΔN188) were fit to the Hill equation to determine binding constants and to estimate the degree of binding cooperativity (“Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 2). The binding data for NS3hel(ΔN188) displays an elongated sigmoidal curve relative to the hyperbolic behavior of full-length NS3. The best-fit Hill coefficients for NS3hel(ΔN188) and NS3 are 2 and 1, respectively, indicating that NS3hel(ΔN188) binds RNA in a highly cooperative manner, whereas NS3 does not.TABLE 1ProteinKd for binding to ssRNAMaximal fraction of bound RNAnmNS3hel(ΔN188)43.0 ± 17.00.35 ± 0.11NS3hel(ΔN166)No binding observed0.00 ± 0.00NS39.0 ± 3.01.00 ± 0.10His-NS31.0 ± 0.41.00 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Full-length NS3 binds TS34 RNA with a much greater affinity than NS3hel, having a dissociation constant of 9 ± 3 nm relative to 43 ± 17 nm for NS3hel(ΔN188) (Table 1). Full-length NS3 with extra positive charge in the form of an N-terminal His tag (His-NS3) binds single-stranded RNA even more tightly than untagged NS3 as expected (Kd = 1.0 ± 0.4 nm) (Table 1). The NS3hel constructs are likely to display such poor affinity for RNA because the helicase domain carries a net negative charge. Indeed, NS3hel(ΔN166) possesses slightly more negative charge (calculated pI = 5.7) than NS3hel(ΔN188) (calculated pI = 6.1) under our binding conditions (pH 6.5) (26Gasteiger E. Gattiker A. Hoogland C. Ivanyi I. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (3463) Google Scholar). NS3 binds a much greater fraction of the available RNA than NS3hel. NS3 binds ∼100% of the available RNA at saturating protein concentrations, whereas NS3hel(ΔN188) binds less than half of the RNA substrate at saturation (Fig. 2, Table 1). Similar results were also observed for the binding of these proteins to two other single-stranded RNAs (data not shown, see “Experimental Procedures” for the RNA oligonucleotide sequences used). Given that most “single-stranded RNAs” collapse into various weak secondary structures, the results indicate that full-length NS3 (even in the absence of ATP) may effectively melt any structural features and bind the RNA quantitatively. NS3hel may not have this capability, resulting in a substantial fraction of unbound RNA. The Serine Protease Domain Enhances Functional RNA Binding by the NS3 Helicase Domain—Although direct binding studies are useful, they cannot differentiate between specific and nonspecific associations and they may not reflect the productively bound form of a helicase. Functional RNA binding assays are therefore important metrics for monitoring helicase-nucleic acid interactions (14Pang P.S. Jankowsky E. Planet P.J. Pyle A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For most DEXH/D proteins, such as NS3, ATPase activity is stimulated by the binding of RNA (16Weirich C.S. Erzberger J.P. Flick J.S. Berger J.M. Thorner J. Weis K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 27Paoletti E. Moss B. J. Biol.

We therefore used RNA-stimulated ATPase assays as one metric of productive RNA association with the NS3 and NS3hel constructs. When monitoring the initial rate of ATPase activity as a function of RNA concentration, we observed that the Km for RNA-stimulated ATPase activity by NS3 (Km = 0.100 ± 0.001 μm) is 20-fold lower than that of NS3hel(ΔN188) (Km = 2.0 ± 1.1 μm) and 151-fold lower, respectively, than that of NS3hel(ΔN166) (Km = 15.1 ± 3.6 μm) (Fig. 3A and Table 2). The kcat values (nmol of ATP/min/pmol NS3 variant) did not vary greatly between these three NS3 constructs (1.4 ± 0.2, 2.7 ± 0.3, and 0.80 ± 0.03, respectively) (Table 2). Thus, the serine protease domain radically increased functional binding of RNA by the NS3 helicase, allowing it to become a more efficient RNA-stimulated ATPase (in terms of kcat/Km) (Table 2). Furthermore, the addition of positive charge in the form of a His tag (His-NS3) further increased functional RNA binding affinity relative to untagged NS3 (Km for His-NS3 = 0.003 ± 0.001 μm) (Fig. 3b and Table 2).TABLE 2ProteinKmVmaxkcatkcat/Kmμmnmol ATP hydrolyzed/minnmol ATP/min/pmol NS3nmol ATP/min/ pmol NS3/μm RNANS3hel(ΔN188)2.0 ± 1.10.84 ± 0.141.40 ± 0.200.7NS3hel(ΔN166)15.1 ± 3.61.60 ± 0.202.70 ± 0.300.2NS30.100 ± 0.0010.48 ± 0.050.80 ± 0.038.0His-NS30.003 ± 0.0010.30 ± 0.050.50 ± 0.10166.7 Open table in a new tab It is interesting that the serine protease domain does not increase the Vmax for ATPase activity of NS3. Indeed, the NS3hel constructs exhibited a 2–3-fold greater Vmax than NS3 (Fig. 3 and Table 2) (NS3hel(ΔN166) Vmax = 1.6 ± 0.2 nmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min; NS3hel(ΔN188) Vmax = 0.84 ± 0.14; NS3 Vmax = 0.48 ± 0.05). Thus, provided that RNA is fully bound, the protease domain does not influence the function of the ATPase active site. To examine this possibility in more detail, we compared the unstimulated, basal ATPase activity of the NS3 constructs in the absence of RNA. Under these conditions, ATPase activity of the constructs was quite similar (NS3hel(ΔN166) V = 0.4 ± 0.1 nmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min, NS3hel(ΔN188) V = 0.20 ± 0.04 and NS3 V = 0.2 ± 0.1). These data indicate that the protease domain only influences ATPase activity by increasing RNA binding affinity, thereby enhancing RNA stimulated activity. The Serine Protease Domain Is Required for RNA Unwinding by the NS3 Helicase—Having established a clear role for the protease domain in RNA binding by NS3, we then set out to understand how it influences RNA unwinding. To address this question, we performed comparative unwinding experiments on two duplex substrates that differ in length and stability: RNA 12/30, which is a 12-base pair RNA duplex with an 18-nucleotide single-stranded 3′-overhang (14Pang P.S. Jankowsky E. Planet P.J. Pyle A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar); and RNA 34/54, which is a 34-base pair RNA duplex with a 20-nucleotide 3′-overhang (19Beran R.K. Bruno M.M. Bowers H.A. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Note that we refer to the shorter RNA strand as the top strand and it is this strand that is 5′32P-end labeled (19Beran R.K. Bruno M.M. Bowers H.A. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. J. Mol. Biol"
https://openalex.org/W1964911255,"The 12.6-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12.6) is considered to be a key regulator of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), but its precise role in RyR2 function is complex and controversial. In the present study we investigated the impact of FKBP12.6 removal on the properties of the RyR2 channel and the propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release and the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. Single channel recordings in lipid bilayers showed that FK506 treatment of recombinant RyR2 co-expressed with or without FKBP12.6 or native canine RyR2 did not induce long-lived subconductance states. [(3)H]Ryanodine binding studies revealed that coexpression with or without FKBP12.6 or treatment with or without FK506 did not alter the sensitivity of RyR2 to activation by Ca(2+) or caffeine. Furthermore, single cell Ca(2+) imaging analyses demonstrated that HEK293 cells co-expressing RyR2 and FKBP12.6 or expressing RyR2 alone displayed the same propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release or store overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR). FK506 increased the amplitude and decreased the frequency of SOICR in HEK293 cells expressing RyR2 with or without FKBP12.6, indicating that the action of FK506 on SOICR is independent of FKBP12.6. As with recombinant RyR2, the conductance and ligand-gating properties of single RyR2 channels from FKBP12.6-null mice were indistinguishable from those of single wild type channels. Moreover, FKBP12.6-null mice did not exhibit enhanced susceptibility to stress-induced ventricular arrhythmias, in contrast to previous reports. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the loss of FKBP12.6 has no significant effect on the conduction and activation of RyR2 or the propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release and stress-induced ventricular arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W2100811920,"The INAD scaffold organizes a multiprotein complex that is essential for proper visual signaling in Drosophila photoreceptor cells. Here we show that one of the INAD PDZ domains (PDZ5) exists in a redox-dependent equilibrium between two conformations--a reduced form that is similar to the structure of other PDZ domains, and an oxidized form in which the ligand-binding site is distorted through formation of a strong intramolecular disulfide bond. We demonstrate transient light-dependent formation of this disulfide bond in vivo and find that transgenic flies expressing a mutant INAD in which PDZ5 is locked in the reduced state display severe defects in termination of visual responses and visually mediated reflex behavior. These studies demonstrate a conformational switch mechanism for PDZ domain function and suggest that INAD behaves more like a dynamic machine rather than a passive scaffold, regulating signal transduction at the millisecond timescale through cycles of conformational change."

They are formed in situ in cell membranes, are cleaved, circulate, and are excreted in urine. Isomers of prostaglandin F(2alpha), the F(2)-isoprostanes, have emerged as sensitive indices of lipid peroxidation in vivo. Analogous compounds formed from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are termed neuroprostanes and are more abundant than isoprostanes (iPs) in brain. Isofurans are another class of isoeicosanoids characterized by a substituted tetrahydrofuran ring. They are preferentially formed, relative to iPs, under conditions of elevated oxygen tension. Here, we report the discovery of neurofurans (nFs), the analogous family of compounds formed from DHA. Formation of nFs is characterized by mass spectrometry and confirmed by oxidation of DHA in vitro and following CCl(4) administration in liver in vivo. It is demonstrated that the levels of nFs are elevated in the brain cortex of a mouse model of Alzheimer disease and are depressed in mouse brain cortex by deletion of p47(phox), an essential component of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. Measurement of the nFs may ultimately prove useful in diagnosis, timing, and selection of dose in the treatment and chemoprevention of neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W2051682149,"Metastasis-associated tumor antigen 1 (MTA1), a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating (NuRD) complex is routinely upregulated in several cancers. In the present study, we investigated the potential role of MTA1 in BRCA1 transcriptional repression and subsequent chromosomal instability. MTA1-NuRD complex was found to negatively regulate BRCA1 transcription by physically associating with an atypical estrogen-responsive element (ERE) on the BRCA1 promoter. Moreover, MTA1 and HDAC complex recruited to the ERE of BRCA1 promoter in an ER alpha-dependent manner. Accordingly, BRCA1 protein levels were enhanced by silencing of either MTA1 expression or by treatment with the specific histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. MTA1's strong repressive effects on BRCA1 expression was supported by our observation that cells stably overexpressing MTA1 showed centrosome amplification which has been long implicated as a phenotype for BRCA1 repression. Accordingly, overexpression of BRCA1 in cells stably over expressing MTA1 resulted in restoration of normal centrosome numbers. Together, these findings strongly implicate MTA1 in the transcriptional repression of BRCA1 leading to abnormal centrosome number and chromosomal instability."

Combining matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry and reverse genetics, we have isolated a novel gene called AcSp1-like and demonstrate that its protein product is assembled into the small diameter fibers of egg case sacs and wrapping silks from the black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus. BLAST searches of the NCBInr protein data base using the amino acid sequence of AcSp1-like revealed similarity to AcSp1, an inferred protein proposed to be a component of wrapping silk. However, the AcSp1-like protein was found to display more nonuniformity in its internal iterated repeat modules than the putative AcSp1 fibroin. Real time quantitative PCR analysis demonstrates that the AcSp1-like gene displays an aciniform gland-restricted pattern of expression. The amino acid composition of the fibroins extracted from the luminal contents of the aciniform glands was remarkably similar to the predicted amino acid composition of the AcSp1-like protein, which supports the assertion that AcSp1-like protein represents the major constituent stored within the aciniform gland. Collectively, our findings provide the first direct molecular evidence for the involvement of the aciniform gland in the production of a common fibroin that is assembled into the small diameter threads of egg case and wrapping silk of cob weavers. Spiders produce high performance fibers with diverse mechanical properties and biological functions. Molecular and biochemical studies of spider egg case silk have revealed that the main constituent of the large diameter fiber contains the fibroin TuSp1.

The ability to spin multiple task-specific silks is a defining feature of the diverse order Araneae (>37,000 described species). Araneoid spiders use specialized abdominal glands to manufacture up to seven different protein-based silks/glues that have diverse mechanical properties (1Foelix R. Biology of Spider. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 1-336Google Scholar). Spinning high performance fibers with different mechanical properties enable spiders to perform a wide range of functions, including prey capture, locomotion, and protection of developing offspring (2Schultz J.W. Biol. Rev. 1987; 62: 89-113Crossref Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of spider fibroins (spidroins) share a number of distinctive features. Repeats of four fundamental amino acid motifs characterize the majority of sequenced spider silks as follows: (i) alternating glycine and alanine ((GA)n), (ii) polyalanine (An), (iii) GGX (X = subset of residues), and (iv) GPGGX. Biochemical studies indicate that these motifs correspond to distinct structural modules, e.g. An and (GA)n repeats form crystalline β-sheets, whereas β-spirals are generated from a series of concatenated β-turns from the repeat structure GPGGX (3Hayashi C. Lewis R.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that these different structural modules contribute to the mechanics of the fibers. Combinations of these motifs form larger repetitive units termed ensemble repeats, which are organized in tandem copies throughout the silk sequence. In addition to ensemble repeat architecture, all spidroins have nonrepetitive C and N termini that exhibit length and sequence conservation (4Challis R.J. Goodacre S.L. Hewitt G.M. Insect Mol.

Spiders construct egg cases to serve as protective cocoons for their offspring (2Schultz J.W. Biol. Rev. 1987; 62: 89-113Crossref Google Scholar). Egg sacs must be designed to resist damage from predator/parasitoid invasion as well as temperature and humidity fluctuations (11Hieber C. J. Therm.

Analyses of the physical structure of egg sacs collected from the cob weaver Latrodectus hesperus, commonly referred to as the black widow spider, have demonstrated that their egg case sacs consist of two different diameter fibers (14Hu X.

Although it has been widely accepted by the silk community that the aciniform glands produce egg case silk constituents and wrapping silk, no molecular evidence has been reported to demonstrate that aciniform-specific fibroins are directly assembled into these diverse materials (1Foelix R. Biology of Spider. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 1-336Google Scholar). Recently, it has been postulated that AcSp1, an inferred protein produced by the aciniform gland, represents a main constituent of the luminal fluid from aciniform glands; however, experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that this fibroin is synthesized and assembled into wrapping fibers of orb weavers was not presented (20Hayashi C.Y. Blackledge T.A. Lewis R.V. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1950-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Because the aciniform glands have been implicated in the production of egg case silk and wrapping silk, we hypothesized that spiders spin common fibroin(s) into both egg case silk and wrapping threads. Here we demonstrate by mass spectrometry and reverse genetics, the presence of the first aciniform gland-restricted product, dubbed AcSp1-like, that is assembled into egg case silk fibers, as well as prey-capture wrapping threads. These findings provide new insight into the molecular constituents of aciniform silks and reveal that black widow spiders use a common fibroin for egg case sac production and prey-capture wrapping silk. Tryptic Digests of Wrapping Silk and the Egg Case Protein—Sequencing grade trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Promega) was dissolved in 50 mm acetic acid at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. In-gel tryptic digestion of the ∼300-kDa band was performed following a published protocol (21Jiménez C.R. Huang L. Qiu Y. Burlingame A.L. In-gel Digestion of Proteins for MALDI-MS Fingerprint Mapping. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 16.4.1-16.4.5Google Scholar). Briefly, the ∼300-kDa band in Fig. 1, lane 2 (asterisk), was excised from the gel. After destaining, the pieces were minced into fine particles with sealed pipette tips, washed with 25 mm NH4HCO3, 50% acetonitrile, and then dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The dried pieces were rehydrated and reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol, alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide, dried again, and then rehydrated and digested for ∼8 h with 250 ng of trypsin. Peptides were extracted with two changes of 30 μl of a 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid solution. Peptides were desalted with C18 Zip-Tips (Omix, Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In-solution digests of the solubilized wrapping silk were performed as follows. Three micrograms of wrapping silk were dissolved in 100 μl of 8 m GdnHCl. Fibroin solubilization was facilitated by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. Prior to trypsin digestion, the sample was neutralized by the addition of 700 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8). Ten micrograms of trypsin were added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were extracted and desalted with a C18 Zip-Tip as described above. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Conventional mass spectra were obtained with a MALDI/TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (4700 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) operated in reflector mode. MS/MS spectra were obtained by operating this same instrument in MS/MS mode. De novo peptide sequences were obtained by manual interpretation of the high energy CAD spectra. Samples from the in-solution tryptic digest of wrapping silk were separated by HPLC (Magic C18 5u, 200A, 0.15 × 150 mm column, 5-35% acetonitrile in water in a 35-min gradient), and fractions were collected onto a MALDI plate that was subsequently introduced into the 4700 mass spectrometer. An equal volume of CHCA matrix, ∼0.75 μl (10 g/liter in 80% aqueous acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), was mixed with each fraction as it eluted from the column. Both MS and MS/MS (where appropriate) spectra were acquired from each spot. Cloning of the AcSp1-like Gene—The partial sequence from the peptide sequence QVDTSTR was used to synthesize an oligonucleotide. Primer degeneracy was eliminated by placing an A or T at the wobble position. PCRs containing the forward primer 5′-CAA GTT GAT ACA TCT ACA CG-3′ and the reverse anchor pGAL4-AD primer 5′-GCA CAG TTG AAG TGA ACT TGC-3′ successfully amplified a 1,049-bp fragment of AcSp1-like from a cDNA library produced from black widow silk glands (corresponding to the boxed amino acids in Fig. 3A). The cDNA library represented a composite library constructed from several silk-producing glands, which included the major and minor ampullate glands, aciniform, tubuliform, pyriform, aggregate, and the flagelliform glands. The 1,049-bp fragment was sequenced as described previously (22Mitchell B. Mugiya M. Youngblom J. Funes-Duran M. Miller R. Ezpeleta J. Rigby N. Vierra C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To obtain a larger nucleic acid fragment encoding AcSp1-like, we screened the cDNA library using conventional approaches with a nucleic acid-nucleic acid hybridization using the partial AcSp1-like cDNA as a probe. Real Time PCR Analysis—Reverse transcription reactions were performed as described previously (23Nguyen L. Round J. O'Connell R. Geurts P. Funes-Duran M. Wong J. Jongeward G. Vierra C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4423-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Real time PCR fluorescence detection was monitored using an Opticon II instrument (MJ Research Inc.). Amplification products were monitored with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) detection and routinely checked using dissociation curve software and agarose gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotides used for the analysis of AcSp1-like were the forward and reverse primers 5′-ACT CTC CAG ATG ACA ATA CC-3′ and 5′-AGA TGC CAG TGT AGA TGC-3′, respectively. Primers used for normalization were the forward and reverse β-actin oligonucleotides 5′-CCC TGA GAG GAA GTA CTC CGT-3′ and 5′-ATC CAC ATC TGC TGG AAG GTG-3′, respectively. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Wrapping silk and egg case silk were coated to a thickness of 14-30 nm with gold alloy in a Pelco SC-7 auto-sputter coater with an FTM-2 film thickness monitor. Strand diameters were measured on a Hitachi S-2600 S.E. operated with an accelerator voltage of 3 kV. Diameters of the strands were measured to the nearest 0.01 μm at three distant places in the sample. Experiments were conducted at ambient temperature and humidity, which was 25 °C and 30-36%, respectively. Amino Acid Composition of Wrapping Silk and Aciniform Gland Contents—Wrapping silk fibers were subjected to amino acid analysis at the Protein Chemistry Laboratory of Texas A & M University as described previously (24Casem M.L. Turner D. Houchin K. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1999; 24: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Wrapping silk and luminal fluids collected from the aciniform gland were hydrolyzed with 6 m HCl to generate the constituent amino acids. Luminal fluids were collected by treating aciniform glands with 2% SDS, followed by boiling at 95 °C for 10 min. Proteins were precipitated using 2 volumes of acetone. Amino acids were derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde and 9-fluoromethylchloroformate, followed by separation by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. Tryptic Digest of the ∼300-kDa Protein and Mass Spectrometric Sequence Analysis—To identify major structural proteins in the small diameter silk fibers of egg case sacs, we treated the threads with 8 m GdnHCl to solubilize them. This treatment efficiently dissolves the small diameter fibers and leads to the partial digestion of the large diameter threads (16Hu X. Kohler K. Falick A.M. Moore A.M. Jones P.R. Vierra C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3506-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis and silver staining of the solubilized egg case extract revealed the presence of 3-4 abundant proteins, with one having an apparent molecular mass of ∼300 kDa (Fig. 1). Similar banding patterns were observed when the chaotropic salt GdnSCN was used to dissolve the egg case samples (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that two of the abundant proteins represent egg case protein gene products (Fig. 1, lane 2) (14Hu X. Kohler K. Falick A.M. Moore A.M. Jones P.R. Sparkman O.D. Vierra C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21220-21230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Hu X. Kohler K. Falick A.M. Moore A.M. Jones P.R. Vierra C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3506-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The ∼300-kDa protein does not represent the major constituent of the large diameter fiber, TuSp1, which is not readily dissolved under these conditions and is missing from detection (Fig. 1, lane 2). Because fibroins are typically high molecular weight proteins, in-gel tryptic digestion was performed on the ∼300-kDa protein (Fig. 1, asterisk). This digest was found to contain numerous peptides, whose masses were determined by MALDI-MS analysis (Fig. 2A). Six peptides were sequenced using high energy CAD, those with precursor ion masses (MH+, monoisotopic) of 1178.8, 1295.7, 1423.8, 1475.8, 1872.9, and 2443.2. The product ion spectra of the peptides MH+ 1178.8, 1295.7, and 1423.8 are shown in Fig. 2, B-D, respectively. The N terminus of 1475.8, as well as the N and C termini of 2443.2, could not be determined, but a significant amount of sequence information was derived (Table 1). The amino acid sequence of the remaining peptide ion 1872.9 was also determined (Table 1). Analysis of the deduced peptide sequences using the algorithm BLAST revealed no significant similarity to any polypeptides in the NCBInr protein data base.TABLE 1De novo sequences obtained by mass spectrometry Peptide sequences obtained from the ∼300-kDa protein following in-gel tryptic digestion and MALDI tandem TOF mass spectrometry. The N termini of ions 1475.8, as well as the N and C termini of 2443.2, could not be determined. The parentheses show the missing residues for peptide ion m/z 2443.2 predicted by the translation of the AcSp1-like cDNA (Fig. 3A). This peptide has a theoretical mass that is identical to the peptide ion at mass 2443.2 obtained by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.Peptide mass (M + H)Sequence1178.8LLQALVPALLK1295.7SLASTLASSGVFR1423.8IASNLGLDYATASK1475.8.....QVDTSTR (partial)1872.9ATQALSSVSADSDSTAYAK2443.2(MG) SDTNAYALAISSALAEVLS (SSGK) (partial) Open table in a new tab Cloning of a Novel Egg Case Fibroin cDNA—To isolate the cDNA that encoded the ∼300-kDa protein, we screened a cDNA library prepared from mRNA collected from silk-producing glands. The cDNA library was screened by PCR using oligonucleotides that corresponded to the peptide sequences obtained from MS/MS analysis (Table 1). The forward anchor pAD-GAL4 primer and the reverse oligonucleotide designed from the peptide sequence QVDTSTR (m/z 1475.8) successfully amplified a 1,049-bp cDNA fragment (corresponding to amino acid residues 233-582). A larger cDNA clone, ∼2 kb, was retrieved by conventional screening of the cDNA library using the 1,049-bp cDNA sequence as a probe for nucleic acid-nucleic acid hybridization. Translation of the ∼2-kb cDNA sequence indicated this fragment contained a long open reading frame (ORF), encoding the C-terminal 599 amino acids of a spider fibroin (Fig. 3A; GenBank™ accession number EU025854). This protein had a predicted molecular mass of ∼60 kDa and a pI of 5.41. Several other clones carrying shorter cDNAs with nearly identical nucleotide sequences were also retrieved during the library screen (data not shown). In protein-protein BLAST searches against the entire predicted amino acid sequence, the top matches corresponded to two putative fibroins (Argiope trifasciata AcSp1, GenBank™ accession number AY426339; Uloborous diversus AcSp1, GenBank™ accession number AY426339). Based upon this sequence similarity and pattern of expression, we have named this product AcSp1-like, which is derived from the abbreviation aciniform spidroin 1-like. AcSp1-like was ∼31% identical to the A. trifasciata and U. diversus AcSp1 amino acid sequences, with statistical E values of 4 × 10−26 and 8 × 10−17, respectively. As expected for fibroin family members that share a nonrepetitive conserved C terminus, AcSp1-like was found to be ∼44% identical to AcSp1 from A. trifasciata (48/108 identities) and U. diversus (37/84 identities) (Fig. 3B). AcSp1-like contained internal iterated modules that were ∼187 amino acid residues in length (Fig. 3A). However, unlike the homogeneous internal modules found in the AcSp1 fibroin, which show nearly 100% identities across 200 amino acid block modules, AcSp1-like ensemble repeats had somewhat less sequence homogeneity (Fig. 3A). Pairwise alignment of the two ensemble repeats found within the amino acid sequence of AcSp1-like were determined to be only 45% identical, with 62% similarities. In addition, the traditional spidroin sub-repeats An and GAn were poorly represented in the AcSp1-like sequence, but several GGX modules were present (Fig. 3A). Four of the peptides sequenced by MS/MS showed 100% identity to translated regions of the AcSp1-like cDNA (m/z 1178.8, 1295.7, 1423.8, and 1872.9). The peptide with m/z 2443.2, which could not be sequenced at its N or C terminus by MS/MS, was found to match a peptide mass from the AcSp1-like protein after theoretical digest with trypsin (Fig. 3A). The partial sequence of the peptide QVDTSTR (m/z 1475.8), which was used to design the oligonucleotides for the screening of the cDNA library, was found as a 100% match within our translated cDNA sequence. However, a theoretical digest of the predicted AcSp1-like amino acid sequence with trypsin did not yield the expected peptide ion mass. The inability to locate a peptide mass that precisely corresponds to m/z 1475.8 within our translated AcSp1-like cDNA sequence may indicate that this peptide resides in the uncharacterized N terminus of the AcSp1-like amino acid sequence. Expression of AcSp1-like mRNA Is Restricted to the Aciniform Gland—Because our mass spectrometric data confirm that AcSp1-like is present within egg case silk fibers, we next investigated whether AcSp1-like mRNA was found within the aciniform gland. We performed real time quantitative PCR analysis to examine the mRNA expression profile of AcSp1-like in aciniform glands dissected from the black widow spider (Fig. 4A). AcSp1-like mRNA levels were by far the highest in the aciniform gland, with virtually no detection in the major and minor ampullate glands, tubuliform, aggregate, and flagelliform glands (Fig. 4B). The expression of AcSp1-like mRNA in the aciniform gland was found to be >1000-fold higher than the flagelliform gland or any other silk gland tissues (Fig. 4B). The AcSp1-like Protein Is a Component of Wrapping Silk—One of the chief functions proposed for the aciniform gland is the production of wrapping silk for prey capture (1Foelix R. Biology of Spider. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 1-336Google Scholar). To elucidate the physical structure of wrapping silk in L. hesperus, we examined wrapping silk collected from crickets immobilized in silk threads using scanning electron microscopy. Analysis of wrapping silk revealed the presence of two different size diameter fibers (Fig. 5A). The larger fibers were ∼2.5 μmin diameter, whereas smaller fibers were ∼500 nm in diameter (Fig. 5B). Bundles of the small diameter fibers were also very prominent in the microfilaments; often these threads contained 4-8 individual fibers grouped together (Fig. 5B). Based upon the diameters obtained from cross-sections of the aciniform spigots, the size of the small diameter fibers is consistent with their being produced by the aciniform silk-producing gland. Individual small diameter fibers observed in wrapping silk were of similar size to the egg case small diameter fibers, supporting the observation that the aciniform gland produces threads involved in wrapping silk and egg case sacs (Fig. 5, C and D). To confirm that the AcSp1-like protein was also present in wrapping silk, we treated these threads with 8 m GdnHCl to facilitate solubilization. Digestion of the solubilized wrapping silk with trypsin revealed the presence of numerous peptides whose masses were determined by MALDI-MS analysis (Fig. 6A). The masses of two of the abundant peptides, 1178.8 and 1295.7 Da (MH+, monoisotopic), were identical to those observed from the AcSp1-like protein in egg case silk. The product ion spectra of these two peptides and thus their sequences were in fact found to be identical to those of peptides found in the small diameter egg case silk fibers (data not shown). Furthermore, the peptide ion mass 1783.1 Da (MH+, monoisotopic), which we also sequenced by MS/MS analysis, was identical to the sequence of peptide ion 1178.8, with the exception of an additional five residues at the C terminus because of a single missed tryptic cleavage event (Fig. 6B). All three peptide sequences for ions 1178.8, 1295.7, and 1783.1 were 100% identical to regions found within the translated AcSp1 cDNA sequence (Fig. 3A; Tables 1 and 2). Even though we were able to sequence three of the major peptides after tryptic digestion (Fig. 6A; m/z 1178.8, 1295.7 and 1783.1), we also analyzed the samples for some of the lower abundance peptides after enrichment using HPLC. To further substantiate that the egg case AcSp1-like protein was present within wrapping silk, we compared the theoretical tryptic peptide masses from the translated AcSp1-like cDNA sequence (Fig. 3A, zero or single missed tryptic cleavage events) within a mass range of a 700-2000 m/z ratio to the experimental masses obtained from wrapping silk after digestion with trypsin. After HPLC-MS analysis of the tryptic digest products generated from wrapping silk, several additional precursor ions were identified as candidates derived from the AcSp1-like protein, which included ion masses 743.5, 964.6, 1468.9, 1692.9, and 1872.9 Da (MH+, monoisotopic). These five peptides were further sequenced by MS/MS. All five peptides were found within the translated AcSp1-like cDNA sequence (Table 2). Peptide ion 743.5 showed a 100% sequence match to two distinct regions of the translated AcSp1-like cDNA sequence (Table 2; Fig. 3A). Peptide ions 1468.9 and 1692.9 were also determined to be identical to regions found within the translated AcSp1-like cDNA sequence, with each peptide ion containing a single missed tryptic cleavage site (Table 2; Fig. 3A). The peptide ion 964.6, which was determined to have the sequence (PS/AL)YKRGTR, contained two missed tryptic cleavage events, and its N-terminal region was determined by MS/MS analysis to represent either PS or AL (Table 2). Examination of the translated AcSp1-like cDNA sequence supported that these two residues most likely represented the residues AI (Table 2; Fig. 3A). It is sometimes difficult to distinguish Leu or Ile by MS/MS because they have identical masses. Peptide ion 1872.9, which yielded considerable sequence information after MS/MS analysis (... ALSSVSADSDSTAYAK), could not be fully sequenced because of the relatively poor quality CAD MS/MS spectrum. Theoretical digestion of the translated AcSp1-like cDNA sequence with trypsin yielded a peptide that contained an identical mass (m/z 1872.9) and sequence, as well as revealing the missing N-terminal three residues (ATQ) that were not successfully retrieved from the de novo peptide sequencing by MS/MS (Fig. 3A and Table 2). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that in-solution tryptic digestion of wrapping silk, followed by MS/MS analysis, results in four peptides identical to those observed in the in-gel tryptic digestion of egg case AcSp1-like protein (m/z 1178.8, 1295.7, 1423.8 and 1872.9; see Table 1 and 2). Additionally, four other peptides derived from wrapping silk after trypsin digestion (m/z 743.5, 964.6, 1468.9, and 1783.1), which were also sequenced by MS/MS, also showed 100% identities to regions found within the translated AcSp1-like cDNA sequence. Thus, these data support that both wrapping silk and egg"

Recent studies have demonstrated that Axin not only plays an important inhibitory role in coordinating β-catenin degradation, but is itself degraded by the low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)5/6 Wnt co-receptor. Here, we demonstrate that the endocytic adaptor molecule Disabled-2 (Dab2), which we have previously demonstrated to act as an inhibitor of β-catenin signaling, interacts with Axin and prevents its interaction with and degradation by the LRP5 co-receptor, thereby increasing its half-life and stabilization. Dab2 levels induced during retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9, or during transforming growth factor-β-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transdifferentiation of mouse mammary epithelial cells result in the stabilization of Axin and concomitant inhibition of β-catenin signaling. Ectopic expression of Dab2 in F9 cells as well as in transformed cell lines results in increased Axin expression and attenuation of Wnt-mediated signaling. We conclude that Dab2 may play an important role in the maintenance of the differentiated state and restrain Wnt-mediated proliferation through its association with and modulation of Axin."

We show here that TFE binds nonspecifically to single-stranded DNA, and photochemical cross-linking revealed TFE binding to a preformed open transcription bubble. In preinitiation complexes, the N-terminal part of TFE containing a winged helix-turn-helix motif is cross-linked specifically to DNA of the nontemplate DNA strand at positions –9 and –11. In complexes stalled at +20, TFE cross-linked specifically to positions +9, +11, and +16 of the non-template strand. Analyses of transcription complexes stalled at position +20 revealed a TFE-dependent increase of the resumption efficiency of stalled RNA polymerase and a TFE-induced enhanced permanganate sensitivity of thymine residues in the transcription bubble. These results demonstrate the presence of TFE in early elongation complexes and suggest a role of TFE in stabilization of the transcription bubble during elongation.

The archaeal transcriptional machinery is a simplified version of the polymerase II (polII) 4The abbreviations used are: polII, polymerase II; RNAP, RNA polymerase; recRNAP, reconstituted RNAP; endRNAP, endogenous RNAP; TF, transcription factor; PIC, preinitiation complex; NTCB, 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid; nt, nucleotides; TBP, TATA-binding protein; T, template strand; NT, non-template strand. machinery. For basal in vitro transcription of most promoters, two transcription factors TBP and TFB are sufficient, orthologues to the eukaryotic transcription factors TBP and TFIIB (reviewed in Refs. 1Bartlett M.S.

(2007) in Archaea Molecular and Cellular Biology (Cavicchioli, R. ed) pp. 139–157, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DCGoogle Scholar). Archaeal genomes encode a protein with a sequence similar to the N-terminal part of the α subunit of TFIIE. The N-terminal part of TFIIE-α is sufficient for basal transcription in the polII system (4Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the archaeal version of TFIIE is much like the evolutionary precursor of TFIIE possessing the core functions of this transcription factor. TFIIE is a general RNA polII transcription factor that stabilizes the preinitiation complex (PIC) in concert with TFIIH (reviewed by Ref. 5Ohkuma Y. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). TFIIE binding to polII recruits TFIIH to the preinitiation complex (4Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Maxon M.E. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R.

It binds to single-stranded DNA (8Kuldell N.H. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5288-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and is required for ATP-dependent promoter opening by the helicase activity of TFIIH. Negative supercoiling of the template and short mismatched heteroduplex DNA around the initiation sites in topologically relaxed templates bypass the requirement for ATP, TFIIH, and TFIIE, indicating an important role of TFIIE and TFIIH in open complex formation (7Holstege F.C.P. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H. Th.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). TFIIE stimulates both the helicase and the kinase activity of TFIIH (8Kuldell N.H. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5288-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) responsible for open complex formation and phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of polII. TFIIE, TFIIH, and ATP play an essential role in promoter clearance even on negatively supercoiled templates (7Holstege F.C.P. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H. Th.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 10Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus, TFIIE, which is released before position +10 from early elongation complexes (11Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), also plays an essential role in the transition from initiation to elongation. TFIIE in human cells consist of two subunits α (57 kDa) and β (34 kDa) that form an α2 β2 heterotetramer (9Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Ohkuma Y. Sumimoto H. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9163-9167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Photochemical cross-linking results revealed interactions of both subunits of TFIIE with promoter DNA in and immediately downstream of the region of the open complex (13Kim T.-K. Ebright R.H. Reinberg D. Science. 2000; 288: 1418-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and in another study upstream of the transcription start site (14Robert F. Forget D. Li J. Greenblatt J. Coulombe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8517-8520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, the TFIIE binding site has been located at the Rpb1 clamp domain in the PIC (15Chen H.-T. Warfield L. Hahn S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Open complex formation in the archaeal PIC occurs independent of TFIIH that is not encoded in archaeal genomes. Therefore, analysis of the core functions of TFE is not complicated by interactions with the complex multisubunit factor TFIIH in the archaeal system. Archaeal TFE is not essential for in vitro transcription but stimulates the initiation rate at some weakly expressed promoters (16Hanzelka B.L. Darcy T.J. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1813-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and mutagenesis of the TATA box or low concentrations of TBP also make the transcription of strong promoters dependent upon the presence of TFE (17Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 21: 133-138Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Little is known on the mechanism by which TFE stimulates transcription. TFE can compensate for TFB mutants in promoter-directed transcription assays and stabilizes PICs containing TFB mutants in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (18Werner F. Weinzierl R.O.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8344-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). TFE stimulated RNAP recruitment to heteroduplex templates not bound efficiently by TBP-TFB-RNAP complexes alone (18Werner F. Weinzierl R.O.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8344-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This finding led to the speculation that TFE stabilizes PICs by enhancing DNA melting and DNA loading. A direct stimulatory effect of TFE on open complex formation, in particular in the upstream part of the bubble, has been shown recently by permanganate footprinting (19Naji S. Grünberg S. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11047-11057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of TFE on transcription depends upon the presence of the E′F heterodimer corresponding to polII subunits Rpb7/4 (20Ouhammouch M. Werner F. Weinzierl R.O.J. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51719-51721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the interaction of TFE with RNAP is mediated mostly by subunit E′ (19Naji S. Grünberg S. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11047-11057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that TFE induces a higher resumption efficiency of stalled elongation complexes and show the presence and position of TFE in initiation and elongation complexes by photochemical cross-linking. The findings reported here suggest an unexpected role of TFE in the stabilization of elongation complexes. Immobilized in Vitro Transcription Assays of Paused Ternary Complexes—C-minus cassettes of the gdh promoter, biotinylated at the 5′-end of the template DNA strand, attached to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, were used as DNA templates for pausing of early elongation complexes at position +20 relative to the transcription start site +1. Standard reaction conditions were used as described in Ref. 19Naji S. Grünberg S. Thomm M. J. Biol.

The reactions were split in 2 × 15.5 μl; after volume compensation to 20 μl with preheated (70 °C) transcription buffer, one half was directly denatured for 3 min at 95 °C with loading dye (21Spitalny P. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30497-30505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The volume of the second half was compensated to 20 μl with preheated transcription buffer containing 40 μm all NTPs. The reactions were incubated for 3 min at 70 °C and stopped by the addition of loading dye followed by denaturation. Reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis in 28% urea-polyacrylamide gels. Abortive transcripts from immobilized templates were isolated from the supernatant of purified ternary transcription complexes as described (21Spitalny P. Thomm M. J. Biol.

Pellets were resuspended in either 25 μlof KMnO4 transcription buffer (70 °C) or 25 μl of KMnO4 transcription buffer (70 °C) containing 500 nm TFE as specified. All reactions were incubated at 70 °C for 2 min. Then, KMnO4 was added to a final concentration of 23 nm. The samples were incubated for 5 min at 70 °C, stopped, and exposed to piperidine treatment as described previously (21Spitalny P. Thomm M. J. Biol.

Photochemical Protein-DNA Cross-linking of Paused Transcription Complexes—Paused elongation complexes were assembled as described (19Naji S. Grünberg S. Thomm M. J. Biol.

DNA templates used in photochemical cross-linking experiments were internally α-32P-labeled C-minus+20 cassettes of the gdh promoter DNA containing azidophenacylated phosphorothioate at specific locations, prepared and radiolabeled by DNA polymerase-directed incorporation of one radioactive dNTP 3′ to the phosphorothioate, essentially as described (22Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 2 nm template DNA were incubated with 20 nm TBP, 60 nm TFB, 46 nm RNAP, and 140 or 500 nm TFE as specified in 12.5 μl of transcription buffer containing 40 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.3, 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 600 ng of nonspecific competitor DNA (herring sperm DNA), and 40 μm ATP, GTP, and UTP. NTP-C mix was omitted when indicated. Complexes were formed at 70 °C; specific competitor DNA (gdh promoter DNA bp –164 to +113 at 400 nm) was added after 3 min. Reactions were UV-irradiated for 7 min at 70 °C 2 min after the addition of specific competitor DNA. Following UV irradiation, complexes were treated with nucleases and finally analyzed on 4–19% or 8–19% gradient polyacrylamide-SDS gels, essentially as described (23Bartholomew B. Tinker R.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 476-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized using an image plate and image analyzer (FLA-500, Fuji, Japan). Photochemical protein-DNA cross-linking of initiation complexes experiments were performed as described in Ref. 24Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5894-5903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, and TFE was added at 140 nm as specified. Chemical Cleavage of Cross-linked TFE—Ten 12.5-μl transcription initiation complex reactions containing TBP, TFB, TFE, and RNAP were assembled using gdhP derivatized with APB at –9 and radiolabeled at –8 and –7 of the non-transcribed strand, as described above. Following cross-linking, the nuclease-treated reactions were pooled, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE 8–24% gradient. The band corresponding to TFE was cut out, and TFE was eluted overnight at 37 °C in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with bovine serum albumin (25 μg/ml). Eluted TFE was concentrated by microfiltration (10,000 molecular weight cut-off), and aliquots were treated with NTCB (50 mm), which cleaves at cysteines, essentially as described (24Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5894-5903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mock treatments were performed under the same conditions but in the absence of NTCB. The 25-μl cleavage reactions were diluted to 500 μl with equilibration buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20) and concentrated by microfiltration (3,000 molecular weight cut-off) followed by a second addition of 500 μl of equilibration buffer and concentration to ∼20 μl. Samples were split, with half representing “input,” and half mixed with Ni2+-conjugated paramagnetic beads for 20 min at room temperature. Supernatant was saved (“super”), and the beads were washed two times with 200 μl of equilibration buffer. Protein was eluted from the beads by incubation for 10 min in equilibration buffer plus 250 mm imidazole (“elute”). Input, super, and elute were analyzed by SDS-PAGE 10–24% gradient, and dried gels were visualized by phosphorimaging. Photochemical Protein-DNA Cross-linking of TFE to Single-stranded DNA—Nonspecific TFE/single-stranded DNA cross-links were performed using six single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing the sequence of the non-template strand of the Pyrococcus gdh promoter DNA from –30 to +13. Each oligonucleotide contained an azidophenacylated phosphorothioate at one specific location (at positions –26, –21, –16, –10, –6, –1, and +1 relative to the transcription start site) and was radiolabeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP (21Spitalny P. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30497-30505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Equal concentrations of radiolabeled and photoreactive oligonucleotides were incubated in binding reactions at a final concentration of 1 μm as described under “Photochemical Protein-DNA Cross-linking of Paused Transcription Complexes” in the absence of NTPs. Templates were incubated with 1.9 μm TFE, rpoF or rpoE′, or rpoL at 70 °C for 5 min. Then, the reactions were UV-radiated at 70 °C. After 5 min of further incubation, loading dye was added; the reactions were denatured for 3 min at 95 °C and loaded onto 4–19% gradient polyacrylamide SDS-gels. Photochemical Protein-DNA Cross-linking of TFE and RNAP to DNA within a Preopened Transcription Bubble—For cross-linking of TFE and RNAP to DNA containing a preopened transcription bubble, templates were prepared essentially as described (22Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with the following changes. 5′ immobilized oligonucleotides containing an phosphorothioate at one specific location were radiolabeled and extended to full template length basically as described in Ref. 22Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. Then, the two strands were separated via NaOH treatment, and the strand carrying the phosphorothioate with adjacent radiolabel was hybridized to a long oligonucleotide with mismatch region comprising positions –6 to +6 (19Naji S. Grünberg S. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11047-11057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) relative to the transcription start site +1 and azidophenacylated as described (22Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For native RNAP shift experiments, 2 nm photoreactive DNA template were incubated in the dark with various amounts of RNAP as indicated in the legend for Fig. 1 in transcription buffer at 70 °C for 5 min and UV-irradiated for 7 min at 70 °C. Following electrophoresis in a 5% native gel (22Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), samples were visualized using an image plate and image analyzer. For cross-linking experiments, templates (and 105 nm RNAP when specified) were incubated at 70 °C. After 3 min, TFE was added to a final concentration of ∼1.9 μm. Samples were incubated for an additional 2 min at 70 °C followed by UV radiation, nuclease treatment, and SDS-gel electrophoresis as described under “Photochemical Protein-DNA Cross-linking of Paused Transcription Complexes.” TFE Interacts with DNA Upstream of the Open Complex in Preinitiation Complexes—Eucaryotic TFIIE is involved in promoter binding and melting (5Ohkuma Y. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and TFIIEα is cross-linked with promoter DNA at position –10, immediately upstream of the open complex (25Forget D. Langelier M.-F. Thérien C. Trinh V. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1122-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To investigate the interaction of TFE from Pyrococcus furiosus with the promoter region in the PIC, we conducted photochemical cross-linking assays with single-stranded DNA, a premelted heteroduplex mimicking an open complex, and we also analyzed cross-linking to the gdh promoter at positions upstream of the transcription start site in the PIC. We used six single-stranded DNA templates extending from position –30 to +4 of the gdh promoter with azidophenacylated phosphorothioate at positions –26, –21, –16, –10, –6, and –1. TFE cross-links to these single-stranded probes were observed after SDS-PAGE (data not shown). In control reactions, no cross-linking was observed with purified RNAP subunits F and L, but subunit E ′was also cross-linked to this probe (data not shown). This finding indicates that archaeal TFE can bind to single-stranded DNA. A heteroduplex with misspaired DNA in the region from +6 to –6 (Fig. 1A) and a cross-linkable derivatization at position –3 was bound by RNAP in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 1B) at enzyme to DNA ratios ranging from 20- to 100-fold (lanes 3–5). When binding of TFE, RNAP, and a combination of TFE and RNAP to this template was studied by photochemical cross-linking, TFE, RNAP, and both in combination were found to be cross-linked to position –3 of the non-template strand after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). A probe containing duplex DNA of the gdh promoter derivatized at position –9 was incubated in binding reactions with RNAP, TBP, TFB, and TFE, and cross-linking to TFB and RNAP subunits B, A′, and A″ was observed both on the template and on the non-template strand (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–4). By contrast, cross-linking of TFE was only found at the non-template strand (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 in the left and right panel). Cross-linking of TFE to probes photolabeled at the non-template stand between position +4 and –21 was also studied. Strong cross-linking of TFE at position –11 (Fig. 2B, lane 4) and a weak cross-linking signal at position +4 were observed (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 8). No cross-linking was observed at positions –21 and –5 (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 6). This finding indicates that archaeal TFE interacts specifically with the non-template strand of promoter DNA mainly in the region upstream of or at the upstream end of the transcription bubble. Cross-linking of TFE was only observed in the presence of RNAP and of TBP/TFB (Fig. 2A). This finding indicates that a complete PIC and the recruitment of RNAP to the promoter are a prerequisite for loading of TFE to the PIC. In the N-terminal domain of TFE from Sulfolobus solfataricus, the crystal structure of a characteristic winged helix-turn-helix motif has been resolved (26Meinhart A. Blobel J. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48267-48274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar; PDB number 191h) that is also conserved in Pyrococcus TFE (see supplemental material). To identify the domain of Pyrococcus TFE responsible for interaction with the non-template strand of the promoter DNA, N-terminal His6-tagged TFE was isolated from gel-purified PICs cross-linked to the non-template strand at position –9 and cleaved by a reagent specific for cysteine residues (NTCB). The cleavage products of TFE consisting of 15.1, 17.3, and 17.6 kDa are expected to contain the N-terminal part of TFE harboring the winged helix-turn-helix motif (Fig. 3B). The purified NTCB cleavage products were incubated with TALON-Ni2+-coated beads, and proteins attached to the beads were purified and eluted from the beads with imidazole. Both the non-bound fraction in the supernatant of binding reactions with Ni2+-coated beads and the fraction eluted with imidazole from the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). NTCB-treated cross-linked TFE was cleaved to a major product of ∼15 kDa (Fig. 3B, lane 2). This fragment was enriched in the fraction eluted from Ni2+-coated beads (Fig. 3A, lane 6) and not in the supernatant from binding reactions containing the Ni2+-coated beads (Fig. 4A, lane 4). This finding indicates that the N-terminal part of TFE containing the winged helix-turn-helix motif is involved in binding of TFE to DNA in the PIC.FIGURE 4A, TFE stimulates synthesis of short RNA products. The addition of various amounts of TFE to an immobilized transcription assay containing endogenous RNAP (lanes 1–3) leads to a significant increase of synthesis of short RNA products. TFE was added at 36 (lane 2) or 357 nm (lane 3). B, subunits E′F are important for significant stimulation of abortive transcription by TFE. Transcription reactions were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures” and contained 50 nm RNAPΔE′F. 260 nm E′ and 405 nm F were added in lanes 2 and 6, whereas 660 nm E′ and 1 μm F were added to the reactions analyzed in lane 3. Increasing amounts of TFE were added as indicated in the figure (71 nm, lane 4; 357 nm, lanes 5 and 6). C, purification of immobilized ternary complexes (21Spitalny P. Thomm M. J. Biol.

Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30497-30505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the complexes were purified by magnet particle separation, small amounts of 5-nt abortive transcripts were found in the supernatant of the reaction (see Fig. 4C for the experimental setup) and were therefore released from the complexes (Fig. 4A, lane 1). Abortive transcripts are generally thought to be formed in repeated cycles by promoter-associated RNAP before the enzyme disengages from the promoter (reviewed by 27Dvir A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 208-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The synthesis of abortive transcripts was ∼3-fold increased in the presence of TFE (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3). This finding indicates that TFE stabilizes these early promoter-bound transcription complexes. TFE interaction with RNAP has been shown to be dependent upon RNAP subunits E′F (19Naji S. Grünberg S. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11047-11057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Ouhammouch M. Werner F. Weinzierl R.O.J. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51719-51721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the effect of TFE on transcription by the reconstituted archaeal core enzyme lacking these subunits (19Naji S. Grünberg S. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11047-11057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As expected, TFE had only a weak stimulatory effect on abortive transcription by the core enzyme, and synthesis of the released 5-nt transcript was significantly increased when the reactions were supplemented with E′ and F or subunit E′ alone (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 7). TFE Increases the Resumption Efficiency of Stalled Complexes of the Post-escaped State—The archaeal RNAP starts translocation when RNA reaches a length of 10 nt (21Spitalny P. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30497-30505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and structural and biochemical studies of ternary polII complexes suggest that ternary complexes reach their full stability when the growing RNA is 14–15 nt in length (28Dvir A. Tan S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28175-28178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of TFE on later steps of transcription, we analyzed the synthesis of a transcript stalled at position +20 and the resumption of stalled transcription complexes in the presence and absence of TFE by the reconstituted Pyrococcus RNAP. TFE had a moderate effect on the formation of stalled ternary complexes (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1, 3, and 5, and 5C, lanes 1 and 3; a quantification of the results is shown in Fig. 5A in the right panel) consistent with a ∼1.5-fold stimulatory effect on the synthesis of run-off transcripts from the gdh promoter (19Naji S. Grünberg S. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11047-11057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We next analyzed the resumption of ternary complexes by the addition of a complete set of NTPs to stalled complexes and studied the decrease of the 20-nt RNA in ternary complexes after the NTP chase. The resumption of stalled complexes formed by the reconstituted RNAP in the absence of TFE was ∼50% (Fig. 5A, lane 2). When TFE was added to initiation reactions, it increased resumption from 50 to ∼75% (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 2, 4, and 6). Considering that the maximum resumption efficiency is 100%, this finding indicates a significant TFE-induced increase in the resumption of stalled complexes. A quantification of the resumption is shown in Fig. 5A, in the left panel (below the gel). When TFE was not present during initiation reactions but added later to stalled complexes (Fig. 5C, lanes 5 and 6), it did not exert an effect on elongation of stalled complexes. This finding suggests that TFE is recruited only to the PIC and not to stable ternary complexes. To further investigate the role of TFE on the elongation of stalled transcripts, we next purified complexes of the core enzyme stalled at position +20. Consistent with the previously published result (19Naji S. Grünberg S. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11047-11057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Ouhammouch M. Werner F. Weinzierl R.O.J. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51719-51721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that TFE contacts RNAP via E′F, TFE had only a moderate effect (∼10%) on resumption of ternary complexes formed by the core enzyme (Fig. 5B, lanes 11 and 12) but dramatically stimulated elongation of stalled RNAP from 10 to ∼30 or 35% when E′ (Fig. 5B, lanes 5 and 6) and E′F (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4) was added to initial transcription reactions. These findings suggest that TFE added prior to initiation affects the conformation of the elongation complex in the post-escaped state. To investigate the effect of TFE on the resumption of stalled complexes in more detail, we analyzed the permanganate sensitivity of the transcription bubble in both promoter-bound binary complexes and elongated ternary complexes. To this end, the NTP concentration was optimized to obtain mixed populations of promoter-bound and stalled complexes (see “Experimental Procedures”). When TFE was added before the transcription reactions were started with NTPs, both the signals corresponding to the open complex at the promoter and the +11, +14, and +16 signal corresponding to the bubble in elongation complexes were intensified (Fig. 6, compare lanes 2 and 3). This finding indicates that the addition of TFE to initiation reactions also affects the stalled elongation complex. This effect is not due to an increased formation of stalled complexes in the presence of TFE because TFE increased the formation of stalled complexes only by 20% (Fig. 5A), whereas the stimulatory effect on bubble opening in the ternary complex was ∼4-fold (Fig. 6, right panel). This finding suggests that TFE increases resumption of stalled complexes by stabilizing the transcription bubble. When TFE was added to reactions containing stalled complexes and these reactions were incubated for a further 2 min, only the modification of thymine residues located in the promoter region was stimulated (Fig. 6, lane 4). This finding confirms our conclusion inferred from analyses of the resumption efficiency of stalled complexes that TFE is unable to bind to stable elongation complexes. TFE Cross-links in Stalled Elongation Complexes to the Non-template Strand of the Transcription Bubble—Permanganate footprinting revealed that TFE-induced stabilization of the transcription bubble in stalled elongation complexes occurs at positions +11, +14, +15, and +16 (Fig. 6). To investigate the molecular basis for the TFE interaction with elongation complexes in more detail, the immobilized gdh template was photoactivated at positions +9, +11, +16, and +21, both at the template and at the non-template DNA strand and cross-linking of TFE and RNAP to these probes, was studied (Fig. 7). In the panels showing cross-linking of transcriptional components to position +9, +11, and on to the non-template strand of position +21, a control reaction lacking NTPs was done to reveal the cross-linking pattern in preinitiation reactions (right lane in these panels). For each control reaction, no cross-linking of TFE was observed. This finding indicates that the cross-linking signals obtained after the addition of NTP to transcription reactions are specific for stalled elongation complexes. As predicted from published work (22Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), cross-linking of RNAP subunits B, A′, and A″ was observed in the PICs at positions +9, +11, and +16 but not at position +21 (Fig. 7, last lane each in panel, +9, +11, and in the right part of panel, +21). When TFE was added to transcription reactions containing NTPs, TBP and TFB cross-linking of TFE was observed in panels +9, +11, and +16, specifically on the non-template strand (see lanes 6 and 7 in the right part of each panel). No cross-linking of TFE to the non-template strand could be detected at position +21 and on all studied positions of the template strand. Cross-linking of RNAP subunits B and A′ was increased in the presence of TFE in some instances (Fig. 7B, panel +9, template strand, and panel +21, non-template strand) and cross-linking of A″decreased by TFE (see panel +11, template strand). Taken together, these findings suggest that TFE affects the conformation of the elongation complex and indicate binding of TFE to the non-template strand in the transcription bubble in elongation complexes. In the first part of this study, we have identified the position of archaeal TFE in the PIC. Archaeal TFE contains a winged helix domain, suggesting a potential for TFE to bind DNA, although the putative DNA recognition helix is negatively charged and binding of this domain to DNA was not detected in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (26Meinhart A. Blobel J. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48267-48274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We show here by cross-linking that TFE such as eukaryotic TFIIE (8Kuldell N.H. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5288-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) can bind to single-stranded DNA (data not shown) and to a preopened bubble both in the presence and in the absence of DNA-bound RNAP (Fig. 1). In addition, TFE is cross-linked specifically to the non-template DNA strand upstream of the transcription start site in PICs (Fig. 2), and cleavage of the cross-linked TFE molecule revealed that the N-terminal domain harboring the winged helix fold is involved in DNA binding (Fig. 3). These data indicate that this domain is involved in interactions of TFE with DNA of the non-template DNA strand in the PIC mainly in the region upstream of the open complex. Intriguingly, TFE has been shown to promote open complex formation in particular in the upstream part of the transcription bubble (19Naji S. Grünberg S. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11047-11057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the findings reported here suggest that this stabilization of the open complex is mediated by direct interaction of TFE with the non-template DNA strand (Fig. 2). TFIIEα and TFIIEβ were cleaved by probes in promoter DNA downstream of the TATA box and overlapping the transcription start site in the yeast PIC (30Miller G. Hahn S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cleavage of TFIIEα mapped to the winged helix domain. The cross-linking data presented here suggest that archaeal and eukaryotic TFIIEα interact with a similar region of DNA in the PIC as predicted on the basis of the remarkable structural similarity of the winged domain of eukaryotic TFIIEα and archaeal TFE (26Meinhart A. Blobel J. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48267-48274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Archaeal TFE interacts directly with TBP and RNAP (17Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 21: 133-138Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This finding and the absence of TFIIF and of TFIIH in the archaeal transcriptional machinery suggest a major role of TFE as bridging factor between RNAP and TBP (26Meinhart A. Blobel J. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48267-48274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The stabilizing effect of TFE on TBP binding and RNAP recruitment may be also responsible for the stimulatory effect of TFE on the synthesis of a 5-nt abortive transcript (Fig. 4). Intriguingly, the synthesis of a 4-nt abortive transcript is a major feature of unstable early transcription complexes in the pre-escape state of polII (reviewed by Ref. 27Dvir A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 208-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The findings reported here and published data (19Naji S. Grünberg S. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11047-11057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) support the conclusion that TFE is involved in the synthesis of these abortive transcripts by stabilizing the transcription bubble in promoter-bound complexes in both systems. Eukaryotic TFIIE has a clearly established role in the TFIIH-driven transition from initiation to elongation (reviewed by Ref. 5Ohkuma Y. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but the release of TFE from early elongation complexes before the formation of a 10-nt transcript was reported (11Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence presented in this report indicate a completely unexpected additional role of archaeal TFE at later stages of elongation. First, TFE enhances the resumption efficiency of transcription complexes stalled at position +20 (Fig. 5). The finding that the addition of TFE to purified stalled complexes has no effect on resumption (Fig. 5c, lanes 5 and 6) indicates that TFE recruitment can occur only during formation of the PIC and not at later stages of the transcription cycle. Second, permanganate footprinting revealed a strong TFE-induced stabilization of the transcription bubble in elongation complexes stalled at position +20 (Fig. 6). This finding suggests that TFE translocates with RNAP following initiation and acts by stabilizing the transcription bubble in elongating complexes. The physical association of TFE with the elongation complex has been clearly shown directly by photochemical cross-linking (Fig. 7). Analysis of immobilized complexes containing RNAP in both the pre-escaped and the post-escaped state revealed that TFE was specifically cross-linked to the non-template strand of the transcription bubble from position +9 to +16 (Fig. 7). The cross-linking pattern of the RNAP subunits A′, A″, and B was also modified in TFE containing ternary complexes. These findings provide evidence that TFE is a part of early elongation complexes and also affects the conformation of the ternary elongation complexes. It is tempting to speculate that the presence of TFE in elongation complexes in vivo increases processivity and decreases pause site occupancy. For example, in particular on long transcripts or operons with several genes, the presence of TFE could have a very large cumulative effect. A direct role of eukaryotic TFIIE in elongation has not been shown, but a potential effect on the processivity of polII by modification of subunits has been discussed (reviewed by Ref. 5Ohkuma Y. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Detailed structural studies of elongation complexes stalled in various registers and cross-linking analyses of transcription complexes at later stages of transcription are required for a deeper understanding of the function of TFE in elongating complexes. Our results reveal a novel core function of TFE in elongation that might also be relevant in eukaryotic transcription complexes lacking TFIIH (31Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 53-540Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We thank Jaimie Powell and Michael Micorescu for assistance in cloning and expression of recombinant TFE.

GHR engagement triggers activation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), STAT-3 and -5, and the mitogen-activated phosphatase kinase pathways but is also under the control of negative feedback (1Flores-Morales A.

Such feedback control includes ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis of the GHR (3Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J.

Of particular interest among these factors are the PTPs, enzymes that, if validated, constitute drugable targets that may be exploited to treat growth-related disorders (2Pilecka I. Whatmore A. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Destenaves B. Clayton P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 18: 12-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The human PTP family comprises 37 “classical” PTPs (which exclusively dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine residues) plus 65 “dual specific phosphatases,” most of which in addition dephosphorylate serine- and threonine-phosphate residues (5Tonks N.K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Some of the classical PTPs have been implicated in GHR signaling, namely Src homology domain 2-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 and -2 (SHP-1 and -2), PTP-1B, and TC-PTP. The enzymatic activity of SHP-1 limits JAK2 activation upon GH stimulation (6Hackett R.H. Wang Y.D. Sweitzer S. Feldman G. Wood W.I. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11128-11132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). By contrast, SHP-2 has been shown to act as both a positive and negative regulator of GH signaling, depending on its local concentration and cell context. It is recruited to the GH-induced complex that consists of GHR, JAK2, and SIRP-α (signal-regulatory protein α). GH stimulation induces SHP-2 binding to growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (7Kim S.O. Jiang J. Yi W. Feng G.S. Frank S.J. J. Biol.

Billestrup N. Carter-Su C. Mol.

GHR, JAK2, STAT-5a, and STAT-5b are all physiological substrates for PTP-1B (9Aoki N. Matsuda T. J. Biol.

Cellular and biochemical assays allow screening of large numbers of PTPs for their implication in pathways.

In the present study we tested all GH-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated players as potential substrates for a large panel of PTPs in biochemical and cellular studies.

We demonstrate that mice that lack the PTP-H1 catalytic domain are significantly heavier than their wild type littermates and present with increased plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), consistent with a greater sensitivity to GH and suggesting that PTP-H1 plays a controlling role in vivo in GHR signaling and adult body size.

The cells were transfected with full-length rabbit GHR (10Pasquali C. Curchod M.L. Walchli S. Espanel X. Guerrier M. Arigoni F. Strous G. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) or GeneJammer reagent (Stratagene). Growth hormone was from Serono, clinical grade. HepG2 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen 21090-022) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% sodium private. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Detection—SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex, 4-12%) were run according to the manufacturer's instructions, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad 162-0112 Trans-Blot) using a dry blot (Bio-Rad) transfer apparatus. The membrane was blocked in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20, 5% dissolved nonfat milk powder and then incubated overnight at +4 °C with indicated antisera at 1:1,000 dilution. The blots were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antiserum (goat anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase (Dako P0447), goat anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad 170-6515), or donkey anti-goat Ig-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz sc-2020) at 1:2,000 dilution, washed again, and visualized by chemoluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences RPN 2106). For the Western blot antibodies, qPCR primers, Luciferase reporter plasmids, and siRNA sequences used, please see supplemental materials. Luciferase Assays—96-well plate-grown cells were lysed in 50 μl/well of passive lysis buffer 1× (Promega E1941); 10 μl of lysate was mixed with 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm ATP, and 200 μm D-Luciferin (Biotium 10101), and light emission was read for 10 s in a MicroLumat LB96P luminometer (EG&G Berthold). 50 μl of 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.2, 100 mm NaCl, and 2.5 μm coelenterazine (Prolume Ltd. 55 779-48-1) was added, and light production was read for 5 s. In Vitro Dephosphorylation of GHR, JAK2, and STAT-3 and -5—HEK-GHR cells were starved overnight and stimulated with pervanadate (50 μm) and GH (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. The cells were lysed, and the indicated proteins were immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitates were divided and incubated with 1 μg of indicated GST fusions of phosphatase domains for 30 min in 37 °C in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Equal GST loading was controlled with Ponceau staining of the nitrocellulose membrane. Serum IGF-1 Quantification—Blood from wild type and PTP-H1 knock-out female and male littermates (four animals per group) were sampled individually and allow to clot for 2 h at room temperature. The serum was removed after a 20-min centrifugation at 1,000 × g, and IGF-1 concentration was measured with a mouse IGF-1 Quantikine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R & D Systems, MG-100). PTP Enzyme Selectivity Assay—Assays were performed in a 96-well plate format, using the catalytic core of a human recombinant PTP as the enzyme (25Wälchli S. Curchod M.-L. Pescini Gobert R. Arkinstall S. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9792-9796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (Molecular Probes, D-6567) as a substrate. The compounds to be tested were dissolved in 100% Me2SO at a concentration of 2 mm. Subsequent dilutions of the test compounds (to yield concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39, 0.19, 0.097, and 0.049 μm) were performed in 60% Me2SO manually. 8 μl of diluted compound or vehicle (60% Me2SO = control) was distributed to a black Costar 96-well plate. 42 μl of human recombinant PTP enzyme diluted in assay buffer (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01% Igepal CA-630, 0.1 mm ethylenediaminetetracetic acid, 1 mm dl-dithiothreitol) was added to the dilutions of compound or vehicle (distributed in a black Costar 96-well plate) preincubated for 10 min at room T, followed by 50 μl of 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate diluted in the assay buffer. After 60 min at room temperature, the fluorescence intensity (integral or intensity) was measured in a Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences Victor 2 spectrofluorimeter (excitation of 6,8-difluoro-7-hydroxy coumarin at 355 nm, emission at 460 nm, for 0.1 s). The percentage of inhibition is determined by measuring the relative fluorescence in absence of a test compound (PTP inhibitor), i.e. with solvent alone (5% Me2SO). mRNA Quantification by qPCR—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen 15596-026) using the manufacturer's protocol. The procedures for reverse transcription and real time PCRs were described previously (10Pasquali C. Curchod M.L. Walchli S. Espanel X. Guerrier M. Arigoni F. Strous G. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), using SYBR GREEN PCR master mix (4309155 from Applied Biosystems). RNA Interference Experiments—Annealed siRNA duplexes (5 nm) were HEK293-transfected using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). In a typical siRNA experiment, adherent HEK cells were transiently transfected with GHR-expressing plasmid on day 1 (using Lipofectamine 2000; Invitrogen), trypsinized, and replated in 24-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) on day 2. Transfection complexes were prepared by 10 min of incubation of 37.5 ng of siRNA and 3 μl of HiPerFect in 100 μl of OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen). The complexes were added to cell suspensions, and the cells were grown for 48 h prior to a 12-h serum starvation on day 4 and stimulation on day 5 as indicated. Efficiency of gene silencing was monitored by reverse transcription-PCR. In Vitro Dephosphorylation Assay—The assay was performed essentially as described previously (9Aoki N. Matsuda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39718-39726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated proteins (protein A-Sepharose CL-4B 17-0780-01; Amersham Biosciences) prepared from pervanadate/GHR-treated HEK293 cells overexpressing GHR were washed twice with dephosphorylation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated with 1 μg of GST-PTP fusion proteins in dephosphorylation assay buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. In the case of JAK2, the JAK2 immune complex agarose (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 14-134) was autophosphorylated in vitro according to the manufacturer's guidelines prior to the dephosphorylation assay. The cDNA cloning of phosphatase domains in pGEX4T3 as well as expression and elution of GST fusions are described elsewhere (26Espanel X. Huguenin-Reggiani M. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2326-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Malachite Green Dephosphorylation Assay—250 pmol of NFLMDNA(pY)FCEADA peptide (Jerini, Berlin, Germany) were added to an empty well of the 384-well plate of the Jerini's phosphatase substrate set containing 360 other phosphopeptides at 250 pmol/well (one peptide/well, see list in Appendix 2). Thirty μl of enzyme diluted at 0.33 μg/ml in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Igepal CA-630, 0.1 mm EDTA) were added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Twenty-five μl of Malachite Green reagent (Biomol International LP, Plymouth Meeting, PA) were added per well. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature absorbance was measured at 640 nm with a fusion (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) instrument. Construction and Analysis of PTP-H1 Knock-out Mice—The PTP-H1 null mice were generated by Velocigene Technology (27Valenzuela D.M. Murphy A.J. Frendewey D. Gale N.W. Economides A.N. Auerbach W. Poueymirou W.T. Adams N.C. Rojas J. Yasenchak J. Chernomorsky R. Boucher M. Elsasser A.L. Esau L. Zheng J. Griffiths J.A. Wang X. Su H. Xue Y. Dominguez M.G. Noguera I. Torres R. Macdonald L.E.

A mouse/BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) containing the PTP-H1 gene was modified to replace exons 15-22 of PTP-H1 with an in-frame LacZ reporter sequence and a neomycin-selectable marker and electroporated into embryonic stem cells. F1 heterozygous mice were bred to generate F2 PTP-H1−/- mice. The 5′- and 3′-flanking mouse sequences of the lacZ insert were... CTC TCA CGT GTC TTC TAG AGT GACandAGACATCAAACCCACCCTTCTCC... PTPH1 knock-out (KO), heterozygous (HET), and wild type (WT) littermates (F2 generation, 87.5% C57Bl/6, 12.5% 129S6SvEv) aged 3-4 months were used for mating. Prior to mating, the mice were housed in separate cages. For mating, one male and one female for each genotype were housed together and maintained in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (lights on at 7 am) at 21 ± 1 °C with food and water available ad libitum. Weaning of pups occurred at 21st day of age, and they were housed two or three/cage. At 21 days of age a tail snip was taken for genotyping. The pups were weighed every 2 days and at 80 days of age were sacrificed by CO2 and analyzed by DEXA. PCR-based Genotyping—Tail snips were digested overnight with proteinase K (Sigma) and passed through a vacuum column (Promega, Wizard® SV 96 genomic DNA purification system A2370) for DNA trapping. Genomic DNA was washed in Wizard SV Wash solution (Promega; containing 95% ethanol) and eluted in 200 μl of water at 65 °C. After protease inactivation at 95 °C, 2 μl of DNA were used for the PCR. Two PCRs were conducted in parallel (TAQ GOLD kit, 0.2 μ/μl final; Applied Biosystems N8080256). A multiple PCR with three primers was used that distinguished WT, KO, and HET mice. The forward primer was designed in the flanking region of the cassette insertion site, the “reverse1” primer was designed in the deleted region, and the “reverse2” primer was inside the cassette (primer sequences: forward, 5′-CTG CTC TCC AGA TGG AGT TG-3; reverse1, 5′GCC ATC TCC ATC GTC ACT CT-3′ (for WT/HET); and reverse2, 5′-CCT AGC TTC CTC ACT GTT TCT-3′ (for KO/HET)). The pair of primers “forward/reverse1” gave an amplification product 254 bp (indicating WT or HET genotypes). The pair of primers “forward/reverse2” gave an amplification product 320 bp (indicating KO or HET genotype). In parallel to the multiple PCR, another PCR for LacZ insert was performed for confirmation to distinguish HET and KO mice from WT mice (primers sequences: forward, 5′-TCA TTC TCA GTA TTG TTT TGC C-3′; and reverse, 5′-CCA CTA TCA GTT GGT CAC TG-3′). DEXA Analysis—Bone and tissue composition measurements were by DEXA densitometry. The Lunar PIXImus II Densitometer (GE Medical Systems) provides bone mineral and body composition results from total body imaging in less than 5 min. Statistical Analyses—The growth curves were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Fisher post-test or by t test. The data regarding DEXA were analyzed by t test. Phosphatase Inhibitors Potentiate GHR Signaling—HEK293 cells represent a suitable model for GHR signal transduction (28Ben-Yair L. Slaaby R. Herman A. Cohen Y. Biener E. Moran N. Yoshimura A. Whittaker J. De Meyts P. Herman B. Gertler A. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, native HEK cells produce IGF-1 when stimulated with GH, approximately as efficiently as liver HepG2 cells, indicating that physiologically relevant GHR signaling pathways are intact in both cell types (29Herrington J. Smit L.S. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2585-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, GHR expression limits the HEK response; only upon overexpression of full-length GHR could GH-induced JAK2 autophosphorylation and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-5 be detected in total cell lysate (Fig. 1B). To further evaluate signaling events in GHR-overexpressing HEK cells, we individually transfected a range of luciferase reporters and stimulated the cells with GH. Only promoters carrying STAT-3 or STAT-5 elements were significantly activated in this cell line (Fig. 1C). Further experiments were performed in a HEK line stably overexpressing GHR, a STAT5 (firefly) luciferase reporter, and a Renilla luciferase internal control, which responded to GH in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental material). Treatment of the HEK line with pervanadate, a potent, non-selective inhibitor of phosphatases (30Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), resulted in phosphorylation of GHR (Fig. 1D). GH combined with vanadate acted synergistically, leaving the receptor phosphorylated 30 min after treatment, at which point phosphorylation by GH alone had disappeared (Fig. 1D, third lane). Phosphorylation of STAT5 was also increased upon vanadate treatment, compared with stimulation by GH alone (Fig. 1D, bottom panel). These results suggest that GH-induced GHR signaling is normally subdued by native PTPs in this cell line. To see how vanadate treatment affects the transcriptional response, we tested the HEK line for STAT-5-driven luciferase activity using different concentrations of GH (Fig. 2A, left panel). As expected, the response was enhanced by vanadate in a dose-dependent manner, even when saturating doses of GH were present (above 10 ng/ml). Because vanadate not only inhibits PTPs but also other enzymes (31Morinville A. Maysinger D. Shaver A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 452-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we additionally tested a cell-permeable organic PTP inhibitor from a previously described class (Ref. 32Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Bombrun A. Swinnen D. Drug Discov. Today. 2002; 7: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar and Fig. 2B) that does not inhibit a large panel of other enzymes (data not shown). Because this pharmacological tool presents an activity (Fig. 2A, right panel) that is very similar to the structurally unrelated vanadate, we can say with confidence that GH signaling potentiation in these experiments is due to PTP inhibition. Both PTP inhibitors increased luciferase responses only in the presence of GH. Overexpressed PTPs Interfere with GHR Signaling—As a first step to identify the PTP(s) that exert this control on GHR signaling, we overexpressed wild type or mutant PTPs and observed their effect on the GH response in HEK. PTPs were selected from a classical PTP panel that covers the majority of the human PTP genome (5Tonks N.K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The mutated PTPs were “trapping mutants” (33Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) in which the general acid residue Asp in the conserved WPD motif is replaced by an Ala, functionally resulting in a stable association of the PTP with its substrate (as used, for example, in Ref. 25Wälchli S. Curchod M.-L. Pescini Gobert R. Arkinstall S. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9792-9796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In a first run, 44 PTPs were tested (see Table 1 for a complete list). Among the PTPs thus evaluated, 10 showed activity and were retested (Fig. 3A). The effect of PTP overexpression on GH-stimulated STAT-3 and STAT-5 luciferase reporters was compared with vector-transfected (no PTP overexpression) cells, stimulated or not with GH (Fig. 3A, last four data points). All of the overexpressed PTPs could be detected using Western blotting (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). For nearly all PTPs there was a strong and reproducible correlation between the induction of STAT-3 and STAT-5 reporters. To rule out transcriptional effects on the plasmid backbone, we also tested the noninducible p53 reporter (Fig. 1C, pp53). The basal activity of this p53 reporter was not affected by PTP overexpression (data not shown). Remarkably, many PTPs significantly stimulated GH-induced STAT3 and STAT5 reporter expression, either as wild type or as trapping mutant. Overexpression may compromise PTP substrate specificity, and we suspect that a number of these activating PTPs modulate GHR signaling through a similar, as yet unresolved, mechanism. The results from these PTPs run counter to our observation that chemical PTP inhibitors stimulate GHR signaling (Fig. 2). In contrast, four PTPs, namely PTP-1B, PTP-H1, PTP-β, and SHP-1 behaved as predicted, with the wild type PTPs suppressing signaling and the mutants enhancing signaling (boxed in Fig. 3A). These PTPs had also been identified earlier as recognizing GHR as a substrate (10Pasquali C. Curchod M.L. Walchli S. Espanel X. Guerrier M. Arigoni F. Strous G. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Mol.

To assess the role of full-length PTP-1B and PTP-H1 in this system, the effect of their overexpression in GHR and STAT-5 phosphorylation was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 3B, overexpression of full-length PTP-1B or PTP-H1 results in dephosphorylation of the tested substrates, consistent with our earlier results. In Vitro Selectivity of PTPs for Tyrosine-phosphorylated Substrates That Are Induced by GH—As another “filter” to discover which PTPs might be responsible for limiting the GHR response in intensity and duration in HEK cells, we evaluated key tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling intermediates as potential PTP substrates. For this purpose a set of GST-tagged PTPs was prepared (human catalytic domains). The purity of the enzyme preparations was checked (supplemental materials). GHR, STAT-3, and STAT-5B were immunoprecipitated from HEK cells that had been treated for 30 min with both GH and vanadate to obtain maximal phosphorylation. The immunoprecipitated substrates were then incubated with 1 μg of each of the PTPs, followed by evaluation of the substrate phosphorylation status using Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4, activated GHR was a very good substrate for PTP-1B, PTP-H1, Meg1/2, PTP-β, and SHP-1/2, in agreement with earlier results (10Pasquali C. Curchod M.L. Walchli S. Espanel X.

To understand the role of the ARMS-specific PAX-FKHR proteins in myogenesis, we characterized their regulation of MyoD expression and function. Reporter assays show that PAX-FKHR transactivate MyoD expression through its 258 bp core enhancer. Gel-shift assays confirm that PAX-FKHR bind to core enhancer sequences showing similarity to consensus PAX3/PAX-FKHR-binding sites. We show that while PAX3-FKHR activates the expression of endogenous MyoD and myogenin proteins in transduced NIH3T3 fibroblasts, it inhibits them from terminally differentiating as shown by low myogenin and myosin heavy chain expression, and lack of myotube formation. Attenuation of MyoD transcriptional activity via phosphorylation coupled to the lack of cell cycle arrest is the underlying mechanism for the differentiation block. Lastly, we show that fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling likely mediates the inhibition of differentiation by PAX3-FKHR. In a single experimental system we demonstrate that PAX3-FKHR can simultaneously induce myogenesis while preventing its completion. We propose a model whereby PAX-FKHR commit a yet undefined precursor cell to the myogenic lineage while at the same time inhibit terminal differentiation, thereby contributing to ARMS formation."

https://openalex.org/W2044918237,"The BCR-ABL oncogene encodes an in-frame fusion protein containing N-terminal sequences derived from Bcr and C-terminal sequences derived from Abl. Bcr contains a centrally located Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) domain that is retained within p210 Bcr-Abl. Although this domain is subject to autoinhibition in the context of Bcr, here we show that it is constitutively activated in p210 Bcr-Abl. p210 Bcr-Abl can stimulate RhoA activation independently of its tyrosine kinase activity, and mutations within the RhoGEF domain that are predicted to eliminate RhoGEF activity inhibit RhoA activation. The RhoGEF mutant of p210 Bcr-Abl does not affect the tyrosine kinase activity of the molecule, nor the ability of p210 Bcr-Abl to interact with XPB through the RhoGEF domain. Despite retaining normal levels of tyrosine kinase activity, the RhoGEF mutant of p210 Bcr-Abl is impaired in transforming activity as measured by anchorage-independent growth. However, the mutant is still able to confer the phenotype of growth factor independence in myeloid cells, suggesting that some, but not all parameters of p210 Bcr-Abl transformation, are dependent upon a catalytically active RhoGEF domain. Collectively, these observations identify a gain-of-function activity attributable to the RhoGEF domain of p210 Bcr-Abl that is required to support the transformed phenotype."

Endothelial cells express TRPC1 and TRPC4 proteins that contribute to a calcium-selective store-operated current, ISOC.

We therefore sought to determine whether endoplasmic reticulum-to-plasma membrane coupling represents an important determinant of ISOC activation in PAECs and PMVECs.

Dynamitin expression reduces dynein motor function inducing anterograde endoplasmic reticulum transport, which allows for direct activation of ISOC by thapsigargin in PMVECs. In contrast, expression of dominant negative kinesin light chain reduces kinesin motor function and induces retrograde endoplasmic reticulum transport; dominant negative kinesin light chain expression prevented the direct activation of ISOC by thapsigargin in PAECs.

Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2986) Google Scholar). Consequently, thapsigargin activates SOC entry without requiring G protein signaling. As with Gq agonists, thapsigargin increases endothelial cell permeability in the intact pulmonary circulation and in cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Interestingly, not all endothelial cell phenotypes respond equally to thapsigargin. Pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs), in particular, respond to thapsigargin with a larger [Ca2+]i rise than do pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) (9Wu S. Cioffi E.A. Alvarez D. Sayner S.L. Chen H. Cioffi D.L. King J. Creighton J.R. Townsley M. Goodman S.R. Stevens T. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This finding is also true in recalcification experiments, where thapsigargin is first applied to cells incubated in nominal extracellular calcium, followed by the readdition of physiological calcium concentrations to measure the [Ca2+]i response to entry through maximally activated SOC entry channels. In these experiments, calcium release is similar in PAECs and PMVECs, yet the [Ca2+]i response to SOC entry is greater in PAECs. One key difference between these cell types is that thapsigargin activates a calcium-selective, store-operated calcium entry current, ISOC, in PAECs, and it does not directly activate this current in PMVECs (9Wu S. Cioffi E.A. Alvarez D. Sayner S.L. Chen H. Cioffi D.L. King J. Creighton J.R. Townsley M. Goodman S.R. Stevens T. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, ISOC activation is important for thapsigargin to induce interendothelial cell gap formation and increase paracellular permeability.Both PAECs and PMVECs express TRPC1 and TRPC4 proteins. These two proteins likely comprise, in some as yet undetermined oligomeric state, the molecular basis of the endothelial cell ISOC (10Brough G.H. Wu S. Cioffi D. Moore T.M. Li M. Dean N. Stevens T.

Endothelium. 2003; 10: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The reason that thapsigargin is able to directly activate ISOC in PAECs and not directly activate ISOC in PMVECs is unknown. However, proper coupling between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane is important for activation of SOC entry pathways (14Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1267-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Kinesin motors move organelle and vesicular cargo in anterograde fashion, toward the plus end of microtubules at the cell periphery, whereas dynein motors move organelle and vesicular cargo in retrograde fashion, toward the minus end of microtubules near the microtubule-organizing center. The endoplasmic reticulum resides in closer proximity to the plasma membrane in PAECs than in PMVECs, particularly at sites of cell-cell contacts (22King J. Hamil T. Creighton J. Wu S. Bhat P. McDonald F. Stevens T. Microvasc. Res. 2004; 67: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), suggesting that the kinesin motor function may predominate in PAECs. We therefore sought to determine whether microtubule motor function is an important determinant of ISOC activation in PAECs and PMVECs. Our findings indicate that inhibiting kinesin activity prevents thapsigargin from activating ISOC in PAECs, whereas inhibiting dynein activity allows thapsigargin to directly activate ISOC in PMVECs. Moreover, ISOC activation is an important determinant of endothelial cell barrier function, because calcium permeation through this channel is sufficient to increase endothelial cell permeability. Thus, we report that microtubule motor function critically regulates endoplasmic reticulum coupling to the plasma membrane necessary to activate the ISOC and disrupt the endothelial cell barrier.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation and Culture of Pulmonary Endothelial Cells—Primary cultures of rat PAECs and PMVECs were performed using methods detailed by Stevens and co-workers (22King J. Hamil T. Creighton J. Wu S. Bhat P. McDonald F. Stevens T. Microvasc. Res. 2004; 67: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The phenotype of each cell population was verified by lectin binding as detailed previously (22King J. Hamil T. Creighton J. Wu S. Bhat P. McDonald F. Stevens T. Microvasc. Res. 2004; 67: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and the cells were passaged by trypsinization. Low passage cultures were used for all of the experiments. For some studies, the cells were treated with either thapsigargin alone (1 μmol/liter) for 15 min, rolipram (10 μmol/liter) for 30 min, or thapsigargin followed by rolipram prior to analysis. The microtubules were disrupted by treatment with either nocodazole (10 μmol/liter) or taxol (5 μmol/liter) for 90 min.Electron Microscopy—PAECs and PMVECs were grown to confluence on membrane filters and then fixed and processed for electron microscopy using methods that were detailed previously (22King J. Hamil T. Creighton J. Wu S. Bhat P. McDonald F. Stevens T. Microvasc. Res. 2004; 67: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The sections were photographed, the images were printed, and then the distance between the plasma membrane and the region of the endoplasmic reticulum nearest the plasma membrane was recorded for each sample.Fluorescence Microscopy—The cells were plated on glass coverslips and then cultured. For analyzing microtubule distributions, the cells were either fixed immediately or were pretreated with rolipram, thapsigargin, rolipram and thapsigargin, nocodazole, or taxol prior to fixation. Fixation was performed by immersing the coverslips in –20 °C MeOH for 6–8 min, and then the microtubules were labeled using previously reported procedures (23Metge B. Ofori-Acquah S. Stevens T.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Commercially available antibodies against α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG/IgM (Roche Applied Science) were used. To image endoplasmic reticulum distributions in cultured cells, ER Tracker (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to culture medium at 1 μmol/liter for 20 min, and then the cells were observed by epifluorescence microscopy without fixation.Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblotting using antibody against α-tubulin was used to measure tubulin monomer and polymer levels in cultured PAECs and PMVECs. These studies were performed essentially as outlined previously by Minotti et al. (26Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Marklund et al. (27Marklund U. Larsson N. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated and cultured as detailed above, and then thapsigargin, rolipram, or both compounds were added. The cells then were rinsed, and then 200 μl of buffer containing 80 mmol/liter 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.8, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml taxol, and 0.5 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin was added to permeabilize the cells. After 5 min, the supernatant containing the soluble tubulin was collected, and the cells then were rinsed with an additional 200 μl of the extraction buffer. The two extracts were pooled, and 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added. The tubulin polymer fraction then was collected by adding 800 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer to the culture dishes containing the residual cell ghosts. The polymer and monomer tubulin fractions then were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using previously reported procedures (28Li Q. Hansen D. Killilea A. Joshi H.C. Palazzo R.E. Balczon R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 797-809PubMed Google Scholar), and the blots were developed using chemiluminescence procedures.Production of Viral Constructs—Overexpression of dynamitin was used to inhibit dynein activity in PMVECs. A previously characterized cDNA encoding dynamitin (29Valetti C. Wetzel D.M. Schrader M. Hasbani M.J. Gill S.R. Kreis T.E. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4107-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Trina Schroer (Johns Hopkins University). The cDNA was excised and subcloned in-frame into an adenovirus shuttle vector, a derivative of pDC512 (Microbix Biosystems, Toronto, Canada) containing a GFP tag to produce an enhanced GFP-dynamitin fusion protein. The resulting plasmid was introduced into HEK293 cells by co-transfection with pBGHfrtdE1,3FLP. The recombinant adenoviral progeny were amplified in HEK293 cells and purified by banding in a gradient of CsCl. Infection of PMVECs at a multiplicity of infection of 50 gave an infection rate of >99% as judged by GFP expression. PMVECs were infected and cultured 72 h prior to use in patch clamp studies. The cells that were infected with adenovirus expressing GFP alone were used as controls. Dominant negative kinesin light chain (KLC) constructs were produced in retrovirus vectors for inhibiting kinesin in PAECs. Isolation of the heptad repeat region of the KLC cDNA was achieved using a strategy originally outlined by Verhey et al. (30Verhey K.J. Lizotte D.L. Abramson T. Barenboim L. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1053-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from rat PAECs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the heptad repeat region of the KLC was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (23Metge B. Ofori-Acquah S. Stevens T. Balczon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41801-41806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using the forward primer ggaattcgccaccatgtccacaatggtgtacatgaagg and the reverse primer gggatcctcagcacagacgtcgaacctgagctcgg. The resulting PCR product was ligated into the TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen). The inserts were released by digestion with BamHI and EcoRI, and the cDNA encoding the KLC fragment then was inserted into appropriately digested pBABE. Retroviral supernatants were produced in Phoenix Ampho cells (kindly provided by Dr. Gary Nolan, Stanford, CA) by CaPO4-mediated transfection. The supernatants were sterilized and used to infect PMVECs. Transfectants were selected with hygromycin (200 μg/ml), and transfected cells (i.e. KLCdn-expressing PAECs) were used for patch clamp analyses and time lapse microscopy and intercellular gap determination.Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Conventional whole cell voltage clamp configuration was performed to measure transmembrane currents in single rat PAECs or PMVECs by the standard giga-seal patch clamp technique, as described by our prior work. Confluent cells were enzyme dispersed, seeded onto 35-mm plastic culture dishes, and then allowed to reattach for at least 24 h before patch clamp experiments were performed. Patch clamp recordings were obtained from single (electrically isolated) rat PAECs or PMVECs exhibiting the morphology consistent with the cells from a confluent monolayer. Recording pipettes were heat polished to produce a tip resistance in the range of 3–5 megaohms in the internal solution. To examine calcium currents, the pipette solution contained (in mmol/liter) 130 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 Hepes, 2 EGTA, 1 Ca2+, 2 Mg2+-ATP, 1 N-phenylanthranilic acid, 0.1 5-nitro-2(3-phenylprcpylamino benzoic acid) (pH 7.2, adjusted with methane sulfonic acid). The external (bath) solution contained (in mmol/liter) 120 aspartic acid, 5 Ca(OH)2, 5 CaCl2, 10 Hepes, 0.5 3,4-diaminopyridine (pH 7.4, adjusted with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). All of the solutions were adjusted to 290–300 mOsm with sucrose. The currents were recorded with a computer-controlled EPC9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA). Cell capacitance and series resistance were calculated with the software-supported internal routines of the EPC9 and compensated before each experiment. The voltage pulses were applied from –100 to +60 mV in 20-mV increments after the whole cell configuration was achieved, with 200 ms of duration during each voltage step and 2-s intervals between steps. The holding potential between each step was 0 mV. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with Pulse/PulseFit software (HEKA) and filtered at 2.9 kHz.Time Lapse Microscopy and Intercellular Gap Determination—KLCdn-expressing PAECs were grown to confluence on 25-mm glass coverslips, placed on the microscope stage, and imaged (40× oil immersion) at 1-min intervals for 60 min using MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA) and Spot Software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Thapsigargin (1 μmol/liter) was added at the beginning (time 0) of the experiments.RESULTSInitial studies established the parameters required to disrupt microtubule patterns in PMVECs. Cultured cells were treated with various concentrations of either nocodazole (0.05–10.0 μmol/liter) or taxol (0.5–10 μmol/liter) for times ranging from 10 min to 3 h. The cells were then fixed and processed for anti-tubulin immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1, endothelial cells have elaborate microtubule networks, and the microtubules are completely disassembled by 60 min of treatment with nocodazole (10 μmol/liter). In contrast, taxol (5 μmol/liter) induced the formation of additional microtubules that appeared to be organized into bundles within 60 min.Thapsigargin activates calcium nonselective and selective (e.g. ISOC) calcium currents in PAECs but is not sufficient to activate ISOC in PMVECs (9Wu S. Cioffi E.A. Alvarez D. Sayner S.L. Chen H. Cioffi D.L. King J. Creighton J.R. Townsley M. Goodman S.R. Stevens T. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of type 4 phosphodiesterase activity unmasks thapsigargin-stimulated ISOC in PMVECs (9Wu S. Cioffi E.A. Alvarez D. Sayner S.L. Chen H. Cioffi D.L. King J. Creighton J.R. Townsley M. Goodman S.R. Stevens T. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and these microvascular cells express the TRPC1 and TRPC4 subunits that comprise the molecular basis of the current (11Cioffi D.L. Wu S. Stevens T. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Studies were therefore designed to investigate why thapsigargin fails to directly activate ISOC in PMVECs. Published data demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum-to-plasma membrane distance in PMVECs is two times greater than it is in PAECs; this increased endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane coupling distance is particularly prominent at the cell-cell border (22King J. Hamil T. Creighton J. Wu S. Bhat P. McDonald F. Stevens T. Microvasc. Res. 2004; 67: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Initial studies were performed to assess whether the endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane distance was altered when phosphodiesterase 4 activity was inhibited in PMVECs. Following treatment with rolipram to inhibit phosphodiesterase 4, PMVECs were fixed and processed for transmission electron microscopy analyses. As shown in Fig. 2, the endoplasmic reticulum was translocated toward the plasma membrane following rolipram treatment, suggesting that endoplasmic reticulum localization may be critical for ISOC activation. To determine whether microtubules regulate endoplasmic reticulum localization within PMVECs, organelle distribution was assayed in control and nocodazole-treated PMVECs using the endoplasmic reticulum-specific probe diOC6. As shown in Fig. 2 (D and E), disruption of the PMVEC microtubule cytoskeleton caused the endoplasmic reticulum to collapse toward the cell center, demonstrating that microtubules control endoplasmic reticulum distribution in PMVECs.FIGURE 2Microtubules control endoplasmic reticulum disposition. A, transmission electron microscopic analyses of control PMVECs illustrates a lateral endoplasmic reticulum stack that is ∼400 nm from the basal plasma membrane and is separated from the membrane by filamentous actin. F denotes filter, the arrow denotes the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the arrowhead denotes filamentous actin. B, transmission electron microscopic analyses of PMVECs that were treated with rolipram (10 μmol/liter for 10 min) followed by thapsigargin (1 μmol/liter for 10 min) demonstrates that the endoplasmic reticulum (arrows) has moved to within 200 nm of the plasma membrane. Summary data from 23 rolipram and thapsigargin-treated PMVECs (155 ± 14 nm) and 36 control PMVECs (248 ± 15 nm) derived from three independent experiments are shown in C.*, p < 0.0001. D and E, microtubule organization determines endoplasmic reticulum disposition. Distribution was analyzed using the endoplasmic reticulum-specific probe diOC6 in untreated PMVECs (D) and in cells that were first treated with nocodazole (E; 10 μmol/liter for 60 min) prior to observation. The arrowheads in D show the cell borders, demonstrating that the endoplasmic reticulum has collapsed toward the cell center in cells without intact microtubules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have previously reported that rolipram pretreatment is required for thapsigargin to activate calcium permeation through the calcium-selective current, ISOC, in PMVECs (9Wu S. Cioffi E.A. Alvarez D. Sayner S.L. Chen H. Cioffi D.L. King J. Creighton J.R. Townsley M. Goodman S.R. Stevens T. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We confirmed this finding presently. Thapsigargin (1 μmol/liter) applied through the patch pipette to single cells did not elicit the ISOC. However, pretreating cells with rolipram (10 μmol/liter) for 10 min before break-in was sufficient for thapsigargin to activate the current (Fig. 3A). As previously reported, the ISOC is an inward calcium current (40 pA at –100 mV, ∼1–1.5 pA/pF) with a reversal potential near +40 mV that is inwardly rectifying. Because the intracellular distribution of endoplasmic reticulum relies on transport by microtubule motors, we next sought to determine whether such endoplasmic reticulum realignment toward the plasma membrane was required for ISOC activation. PMVECs were therefore first pretreated with either nocodazole (10 μmol/liter for 60 min) or taxol (5 μmol/liter for 60 min), and then we administered rolipram and thapsigargin (Fig. 3B). Both nocodazole and taxol prevented rolipram/thapsigargin from activating ISOC, suggesting that an intact microtubule network is necessary for rolipram to reveal the thapsigargin-activated ISOC.FIGURE 3Type 4 phosphodiesterase inhibition unmasked ISOC in PMVECs, an effect that was abolished by either disrupting or stabilizing microtubules. A, single PMVECs were incubated with the type 4 phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram (10 μmol/liter), and macroscopic currents were recorded by the whole cell patch clamp configuration as described elsewhere. The currents were evoked by applying serial 200-ms pulses from –100 mV to +60 mV with 20-mV increments from holding potential of 0 mV. In rolipram-incubated PMVECs (▪), intracellular infusion of thapsigargin (1 μmol/liter, EC95) revealed the activation of ISOC. Left panel, representative current traces obtained in a rolipram-incubated PMVEC with intracellular thapsigargin infusion. Right panel, averaged current-voltage (I-V) relationship obtained from eight cells. B, single PMVECs were incubated with rolipram along with nocodazole (□) or taxol (▵), and macroscopic currents were recorded. Both nocodazole and taxol abolished the ISOC revealed in rolipram-incubated PMVECs with intracellular thapsigargin infusion. Left panel, representative current traces obtained in rolipram and nocodazole or rolipram and taxol preincubated PMVECs with intracellular thapsigargin infusion, respectively. Right panel, averaged I-V relationships obtained from cells incubated with rolipram plus nocodazole or taxol (n = 6 each). *, p < 0.005 rolipram-incubated PMVECs versus rolipram along with nocodazole- or taxol-incubated PMVECs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These findings incriminate microtubule network organization as a key intermediate that controls endoplasmic reticulum coupling to the plasma membrane necessary for ISOC activation. Two opposing microtubule motors determine the vector for transport along microtubules. Dynein moves bound vesicles toward the minus end of microtubules (toward the centrosome or microtubule organizing center), whereas kinesin moves bound vesicles toward the positive end of microtubules (toward the plasma membrane). Because endoplasmic reticulum interacts with microtubules and possesses a central distribution in PMVECs (more so than in PAECs), we reasoned that the dynein motor predominates in these cells and represents an important mechanism for controlling ISOC activation. To test this idea, full-length dynamitin-GFP cDNA was expressed in PMVECs using adenovirus. The cells were selected to homogeneity using GFP fluorescence and trypsinized in to single cell suspensions for electrophysiology recordings. Thapsigargin (1 μmol/liter) application induced the ISOC current in PMVECs heterologously expressing dynamitin; ISOC activation did not require rolipram pretreatment (Fig. 4). In contrast, in cells infected with adenovirus to express GFP, thapsigargin did not directly activate ISOC. Thus, the dynein molecular motor predominates in PMVECs and prevents thapsigargin from directly activating ISOC. Disrupting the activity of the dynein motor is s"

Reduction of the mutant with sodium dithionite and reoxidation with Me2SO, however, regenerates the long-wavelength absorbance of functional enzyme, although the wavelength maximum is shifted to 670 nm from the 720 nm of wild-type enzyme.

In addition to steady-state kinetics under a variety of conditions, rapid reaction studies with both the Rhodobacter capsulatus (10Adams B. Smith A.T. Bailey S. McEwan A.G. Bray R.C.

With the R. sphaeroides enzyme, the reaction of reduced enzyme with Me2SO at low pH is biphasic. A fast [Me2SO]-dependent phase (klim ∼ 1000 s–1) yields a spectrally distinct Ered·Me2SO complex, with absorption maxima at 490 and 550 nm, followed by a slower oxygen abstraction step (35 s–1) that yields DMS and Eox (13Cobb N. Conrads T. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11007-11017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The hyperbolic dependence of the rapid phase on [Me2SO] gives a K Me2SOd of ∼155 μm and indicates that the observed Ered·Me2SO species is not the initial Michaelis complex but instead is the product of its breakdown. Oxidized enzyme also reacts with excess DMS to give this same Ered·Me2SO species (5Garton S.D. Hilton J. Hiroyuki O. Crouse B.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem.

Trp-116 hydrogen-bonds to the labile MoO group of oxidized enzyme and, thus, may be directly involved in catalysis. The role of Tyr-114 is less clear, although it also is close to the molybdenum center and has been suggested to hydrogen-bond to the oxygen atom of bound Me2SO in the Ered·Me2SO complex (24Johnson K.E.

The Y114F mutant turns over substantially more rapidly with both Me2SO and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO, an alternate oxidizing substrate) relative to the wild-type enzyme in steady-state assays, although this increase in rate is offset by a decrease in substrate affinity (24Johnson K.E.

It has thus been suggested that Tyr-114 stabilizes the substrate-bound intermediate Ered·Me2SO (24Johnson K.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13178-13185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Ridge J.P. Aguey-Zinsou K.-F. Bernhardt P.V. Brereton I.M. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15762-15769Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Initial characterization of the W116F mutant from R. capsulatus showed that its molybdenum center is five-coordinate, with one of the pterin ligands of the LMoO2 coordination sphere (that designated crystallographically as “Q”) replaced by a second MoO (26Hemann C. Hood B.L. Fulton M. Hänsch R. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Kirk M.L. Hille R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16567-16577Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mutant enzyme exhibited ∼10% of wild-type catalytic activity. The present work reports a detailed spectroscopic and rapid reaction kinetic study of wild-type R. capsulatus Me2SO reductase and the Y114F and W116F mutants and provides new insights into the structural and functional roles of Tyr-114 and Trp-116 in the wild-type enzyme. Protein Purification; Purification of Recombinant Me2SO Reductase—R. capsulatus strain 37b4 carrying the recombinant dorA gene and its mutants, generated as described previously (23Shaw A.L. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Ridge J.P. Aguey-Zinsou K.-F. Bernhardt P.V. Brereton I.M. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15762-15769Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was grown photoheterotrophically using malate as the carbon source and in the presence of ∼60 mm Me2SO. All purification steps for the recombinant enzyme forms were performed as described previously (13Cobb N. Conrads T. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11007-11017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), including the redox cycling used to generate the functional form of the enzyme. Purified enzyme was concentrated and stored in liquid nitrogen until needed. UV-visible Spectroscopy—UV-visible spectra were obtained using a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode-array spectrophotometer. Steady-state and rapid reaction experiments were performed using an Applied Photophysics Inc. SX.18MV stopped-flow apparatus equipped with a photodiode array detector; data analysis was performed using software provided by the manufacturer. Solutions of Me2SO reductase were made anaerobic by placing enzyme in a tonometer and repeatedly evacuating and flushing with O2-free argon. Reduced enzyme was prepared by titration using sodium dithionite and following the reaction spectrophotometrically. Calibration of sodium dithionite was done by titration of dithionite stock solutions against 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) as described previously (13Cobb N. Conrads T. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11007-11017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Enzyme-monitored Turnover Experiments—Enzyme-monitored turnover experiments were performed by mixing ∼50 μm enzyme with 2 mm Me2SO and 25 mm dithionite in a stopped-flow apparatus at 5 °C. For deconvolution of the spectra seen in the course of the reaction, parent spectra for oxidized enzyme and the Ered·Me2SO complex seen in the course of the oxidative half-reaction were obtained by mixing enzyme with buffer alone and with 100 mm DMS, respectively. The parent spectrum for the Mo(V) form of wild-type and Y114F Me2SO reductase was taken as the stable resting line-shape observed in the course of turnover with TMAO, and the reduced parent spectra were obtained by taking the final resting spectrum from enzyme-monitored turnover experiments performed with excess dithionite as reductant. Spectral deconvolution was performed using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of a matrix of parent spectra (M) using the equation C = (M′M)–1·M′, which for each experimental spectrum obtained in the course of the reaction yields the relative contributions of each of the parent spectra. Further manipulations were performed using SigmaPlot Version 8.0. Because sodium dithionite (which absorbs strongly in the near-UV) was used as reductant, spectral analysis was restricted to wavelengths above 400 nm. Simulations of these reactions were performed using Applied Photophysics software. In some cases (e.g. with the Y114F mutant and Me2SO as substrate) the generally similar component spectra for oxidized, Mo(V), and Ered·Me2SO enzyme forms required fitting of the experimental data by hand. All these experiments were performed in 50 mm KH2PO4, 0.6 mm EDTA, pH 6.0. pH Dependence of DMS Oxidation—Steady-state assays of phenazine ethosulfate-dependent DMS:DCIP oxidoreductase activity were performed as described previously (10Adams B. Smith A.T. Bailey S. McEwan A.G. Bray R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8501-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The activity was measured with DMS (20 mm) and PES (0.2 mm) using DCIP (0.04 mm) as the electron acceptor; all assays were performed anaerobically. Activity was calculated from the loss of 600-nm absorbance using an ϵ600 of 23.0 mm–1 cm–1 for DCIP corrected for background activity (measured at each pH in the absence of enzyme). Buffers used for the pH dependence were 50 mm KH2PO4, 0.6 mm EDTA, pH 6.0, 50 mm Bis-Tris, 0.6 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.6 mm EDTA (pH 7.5, 8.0, 8.5), 100 mm CHES, 0.6 mm EDTA, pH 9.0, and 100 mm borate, 0.6 mm EDTA (pH 9.5 and 10.0). Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—Samples for EPR characterization of R. capsulatus enzyme forms were prepared by mixing oxidized enzyme and made anaerobic in a glass tonometer with a concentrated dithionite solution (either with or without TMAO) followed by rapid freezing in a liquid nitrogen cooled acetone bath. EPR measurements were carried out using a Brüker ESP 300 spectrometer with the following instrument settings: modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 5 gauss, sweep width of 300 gauss (from 3250–3550 gauss), and 2 milliwatts of microwave power. Resonance Raman—Samples for resonance Raman studies were prepared in 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.0; EDTA was removed, and a low buffer concentration was used to minimize the possibility of any interference due to phosphate or EDTA vibrational modes. Samples were concentrated to 1–3 mm by Microcon ultrafiltration at 5 °C. Cryogenic samples (25–35 μl) were frozen by placing the protein solution in the sample well of a nickel-plated sample holder affixed to the cold finger of an APD Cryogenics Inc. liquid helium cryostat. Resonance Raman spectra were obtained and calibrated using previously described instrumentation and methods (26Hemann C. Hood B.L. Fulton M. Hänsch R. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Kirk M.L. Hille R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16567-16577Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The PEAKFIT program from Jandel Scientific was used to determine Raman band positions with a maximal error of ±2 cm–1. Base-line correction was performed by polynomial fits using an in-house MATLAB Version 6.1.0.450 macro (The MathWorks, Inc.) running on a SGI Octane2 work station; corrected spectra were plotted using SigmaPlot Version 8.0. UV-visible Spectroscopy of Me2SO Reductase Mutants—Fig. 1 shows the UV-visible spectra of the (redox-cycled) oxidized, reduced, and Ered·Me2SO forms of wild-type, Y114F, and W116F Me2SO reductase at pH 6.0. The spectra for wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1A) are well characterized (21Yamamoto I. Wada N. Ujiiye T. Tachibana M. Matsuzaki M. Kajiwara H. Watanabe Y. Hiano H. Okubo A. Satoh T. Yamazaki S. Biosci.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15762-15769Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Oxidized enzyme has an absorption maximum at 720 nm (indicative of bis(enedithiolate) coordination) and shoulders at ∼560, 470, and 360 nm; the reduced enzyme has absorption bands at 640 and 380 nm; the Ered·Me2SO complex has absorption maxima at 560 and 485 nm. For the Tyr-114 mutant (Fig. 1B), as seen previously, the spectrum of the oxidized enzyme is very similar to that seen for the wild-type enzyme (24Johnson K.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13178-13185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Ridge J.P. Aguey-Zinsou K.-F. Bernhardt P.V. Brereton I.M. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15762-15769Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Such differences as do exist include a modest bleaching in the near UV (best evidenced by loss of the band centered at 350 nm) and a slight red-shift of the long-wavelength absorbance from 720 nm in the wild-type enzyme to 730 nm. The spectrum of the reduced Y114F mutant is also similar to that of the wild-type enzyme but with some extinction loss observed in the 375-nm absorption maximum and a red-shift in the long-wavelength absorption from 640 to 660 nm. On the other hand, as previously observed by Ridge et al. (25Ridge J.P. Aguey-Zinsou K.-F. Bernhardt P.V. Brereton I.M. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15762-15769Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the spectrum of the Ered·Me2SO complex is significantly perturbed upon mutation of Tyr-114 to phenylalanine. Compared with the spectrum of the wild-type complex, which has strong absorbance maxima at 485 and 550 nm, the complex seen with the Y114F mutant has significantly weaker absorption bands at 470 and 565 nm. That the Ered·Me2SO spectrum is so perturbed upon mutation is consistent with Tyr-114 being involved in hydrogen-bonding to the oxygen of the complexed Me2SO (24Johnson K.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13178-13185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Ridge J.P. Aguey-Zinsou K.-F. Bernhardt P.V. Brereton I.M. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15762-15769Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The as-isolated W116F mutant lacks appreciable long-wavelength absorbance (Fig. 1C). On the basis of the similarity of the spectrum to that for the pentacoordinate “HEPES-modified” form of the wild-type enzyme, in which the Q pterin has dissociated from the molybdenum (20Bray R.C. Adams B. Smith A.T. Bennett B. Bailey S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11258-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the mutant enzyme is also thought also to be predominantly five-coordinate (26Hemann C. Hood B.L. Fulton M. Hänsch R. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Kirk M.L. Hille R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16567-16577Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Redox-cycling oxidized W116F mutant by reduction with MV· and reoxidation with Me2SO results in a spectrum with the characteristic long-wavelength absorption of bis(enedithiolate) coordination, albeit blue-shifted to 680 nm relative to the 740 nm of wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1C). We conclude that the oxidized W116F mutant regains bis(enedithiolate) coordination upon redox-cycling. The spectrum of the reduced W116F mutant is also perturbed relative to that of the wild-type enzyme and resembles that seen for the Ered·Me2SO complex of wild-type enzyme (rather than the reduced form), with absorption maxima at 470 and 550 nm (as compared with 470 and 565 nm for wild-type enzyme). Surprisingly, the addition of DMS (to a concentration of 10 mm) to the oxidized W116F enzyme results in a uniform bleaching over the entire visible spectrum, with little if any indication of the characteristic spectrum of the Ered·Me2SO complex of wild-type enzyme formed under these conditions. The spectrum seen with the mutant in fact resembles that of the reduced “as-isolated” pentacoordinate form of the enzyme (20Bray R.C. Adams B. Smith A.T. Bennett B. Bailey S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11258-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Q pterin has dissociated upon treatment with DMS (Fig. 1C, inset). Oxidative and Reductive Half-reaction Kinetics of Wild-type and Y114F Me2SO Reductase—To better understand the catalytic behavior of R. capsulatus Me2SO reductase, the rapid reaction kinetics of reduced wild-type enzyme and mutants was examined. Our previous work was done with the wild-type R. sphaeroides enzyme, and the work here with the wild-type R. capsulatus enzyme was done to ensure proper comparison with the R. capsulatus mutants that were the primary focus. Measurements were performed at pH 6.0, 25 °C and are summarized in Table 1. In the reaction of reduced enzyme with Me2SO, the Ered·Me2SO species formed in the 2–3-ms dead time of the stopped-flow apparatus with both the wild-type and Y114F mutant R. capsulatus enzyme (consistent with the limiting rate of reaction seen with the R. sphaeroides enzyme of ∼1000 s–1; Ref. 13Cobb N. Conrads T. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11007-11017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). With wild-type enzyme this intermediate broke down to oxidized enzyme with a rate constant of 43 s–1, comparable to the 38 s–1 seen with the R. sphaeroides enzyme and in excellent agreement with the previously reported steady-state kcat of 42.9 s–1 (25Ridge J.P. Aguey-Zinsou K.-F. Bernhardt P.V. Brereton I.M. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15762-15769Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). With the Y114F mutant, the Ered·Me2SO complex decayed to Eox with a rate 103 s–1, approximately twice as fast as seen with wild-type enzyme and in satisfactory agreement with the reported steady-state kcat for the mutant of 81.4 s–1 (25Ridge J.P. Aguey-Zinsou K.-F. Bernhardt P.V. Brereton I.M. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15762-15769Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Pre-steady-state kinetic data obtained for wild-type, Y114F, and W116F recombinant Me2SO reductaseOxidative half-reactionReductive half-reaction5 °C25 °CMo(VI)/Mo(V)Mo(V)/Mo(IV)s-1s-1s-1s-1Enzyme form Wild type13 ± 143 ± 1.74.9 ± 0.20.83 ± 0.06 Y114F28 ± 1103 ± 4.31.2 ± 0.030.19 ± 0.02 W116F14 ± 161 ± 1.20.74 ± 0.050.41 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab Reoxidation of reduced wild-type Me2SO reductase by Me2SO is known to be incomplete, with a significant amount of the Ered·Me2SO complex remaining at the end of the reaction (20Bray R.C. Adams B. Smith A.T. Bennett B. Bailey S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11258-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the initial and final spectra observed during the reaction of reduced enzyme with Me2SO for the wild-type enzyme (2A) and Y114F mutant (2B) along with the independently determined spectra for the oxidized enzyme forms. Fits of the final resting spectrum for wild-type enzyme using the known spectra for oxidized and Ered·Me2SO forms suggests that only ∼60% of the enzyme becomes fully oxidized at the completion of the reaction, consistent with earlier work (20Bray R.C. Adams B. Smith A.T. Bennett B. Bailey S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11258-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the spectrum seen at the end of reaction with the Y114F mutant is virtually identical to that for the oxidized enzyme, implying that the Ered·Me2SO ⇄ Eox + DMS equilibrium lies further to the right for the mutant than is the case with the wild-type enzyme. This is consistent with the conclusion that Tyr-114 interacts with bound Me2SO; its mutation to Phe both increases the rate of decay of the Ered·Me2SO intermediate and decreases its thermodynamic stability. We next examined the reaction of oxidized enzyme with the non-physiological reductant sodium dithionite as a surrogate for the physiological DorC cytochrome. As expected on the basis of previous work with the R. sphaeroides enzyme (13Cobb N. Conrads T. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11007-11017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), reduction of the recombinant wild-type R. capsulatus enzyme (Fig. 3A) was biphasic, with an absorption spectrum very similar to for the “high-g split” Mo(V) intermediate, with wild-type R. sphaeroides Me2SO reductase first appearing, then decaying to that of the fully reduced enzyme. As with the R. sphaeroides enzyme, decay of the Mo(V) species exhibited non-exponential behavior for reasons that are not understood. Nevertheless, at pH 6.0 and 5 °C, fits to the data (in the reaction of 100 μm wild-type enzyme with ∼25 mm dithionite) yielded rate constants of 5 and 0.8 s–1 for the Mo(VI)/Mo(V) and Mo(V)/Mo(IV) transitions, respectively. The Mo(V) species also accumulated to a significant degree in the reaction of the Y114F mutant with dithionite, with rate constants for formation and decay of 1 and ∼0.2 s–1, respectively. The Y114F mutant, thus, reacts somewhat more sluggishly with dithionite than does wild-type enzyme. To confirm that the intermediate seen with both wild-type and Y114F enzyme indeed represented the absorption spectrum of a Mo(V) species, freeze-quench EPR experiments were performed. The insets of Figs. 3, A and B, show the EPR spectra seen in the course of the reduction with dithionite, with sample being frozen with in 5 s of the addition of dithionite. The observed signals are indistinguishable from the catalytically relevant high-g split Mo(V) signal described previously (9Bennett B. Benson N. McEwan A.G. Bray R.C. Eur. J.

Enzyme-monitored Turnover with Wild-type and Y114F Me2SO Reductase—We have recently demonstrated the utility of enzyme-monitored turnover studies with the R. sphaeroides Me2SO reductase (13Cobb N. Conrads T. Hille R. J. Biol.

In such experiments enzyme (at a sufficiently high concentration that its absorption spectrum can be accurately monitored) is mixed with excess concentrations of both Me2SO (or TMAO) as oxidizing substrate and dithionite as reducing substrate. There is a rapid approach to the steady state which is subsequently maintained until the limiting substrate is exhausted. Spectra observed in the course of turnover may be treated as the weighted sum of the component spectra of all catalytically important enzyme species (e.g. Eox, Ered, and the high-g split species) and deconvoluted to give quantitative time courses for each species (see “Experimental Procedures”).

This investigation examined the profiles of ameloblastin in the ameloblasts and in the enamel matrix during different postnatal (PN) days (days 0-9) of development of mouse molar, using an antibody specific for C-terminal sequence of ameloblastin (Ct; GNKVHQPQVHNAWRF). Ameloblastin is found in three different molecular sizes (37, 55, and 66 kDa) in both ameloblasts and enamel matrix during PN development. In the ameloblasts, the sequence of expression of these fractions varied. The 37-kDa fraction was observed (even before the appearances of mRNA of the proteases, enamelysin and kallikrein-4) on days 0 and 1, persisted until day 3, and was not found thereafter. Other isoforms (55 and 66 kDa) distinctly appeared in ameloblasts after day 1, reached a peak on day 5, and remained thereafter. The Ct-positive granules appeared beaded in the ameloblasts on day 3. In the extracellular matrix, a 37-kDa (but not 66- or 55-kDa) fraction was detected on days 0 and 1 and remained in the matrix throughout the PN days. The larger isoforms (55 and 66 kDa) appeared in the enamel matrix from day 3 onward. On days 0-3, but not later, the 37-kDa isoform co-localizes with amelogenin in Tomes' process and formative enamel, as revealed by laser scan confocal microscopy. Autoradiography confirmed accumulation of 3H-labeled amelogenin trityrosyl motif peptide in the region of Tomes' process and formative enamel from day 0 to 3. These observations suggest that the 37-kDa isoform interacts with amelogenin during early tooth development.

During tooth development, enamel matrix is formed by ameloblasts, which synthesize and secrete two major classes of structural proteins, glycosylated (ameloblastin and enamelin) and nonglycosylated (amelogenin) (1Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Simmer J.P. J. Struct. Boil. 1999; 126: 270-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In amelogenin and ameloblastin-null mice, the enamel is defective, disorganized, and hypoplastic (2Gibson C.W. Yuan Z.A. Hall B. Longenecker G. Chen E. Thyagarajan T. Sreenath T. Wright J.T.

Although the role of amelogenin in enamel maturation has been studied extensively (1Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Simmer J.P. J. Struct. Boil. 1999; 126: 270-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), there is a paucity of information on the role of ameloblastin in the enamel growth.Yamakoshi et al. (4Yamakoshi Y. Tanabe T.

The most compelling evidence emerges from recently developed ameloblastin-null mice (3Fukumoto S. Kiba T. Hall B. Iehara N. Nakamura T. Longenecker G. Krebsbach P.H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Severe enamel hypoplasia and hypomineralization and detachment of ameloblasts from the matrix are observed in ameloblastin-null mice. Although amelogenin is attached to the dentin surface in ameloblastin-null mice, it failed to progress into enamel, suggesting that “ameloblastin may provide a scaffolding to organize enamel matrix protein structures to initiate crystal formation and growth” (3Fukumoto S.

A recent report on the binding interaction between amelogenin and ameloblastin in both native and recombinant ameloblastin (5Ravindranath H.H. Chen L. Zeichner-David M. Ishima R. Ravindranath R.M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) favors the speculation of a cooperative heteromolecular interaction between ameloblastin and amelogenin during enamel formation.In order to understand the organization, integrity, and stabilization of enamel, there is a need to elucidate the spatiotemporal expression of ameloblastin during enamel development. In this investigation, we have identified unique, hitherto unknown and stage-specific isoforms of ameloblastin during postnatal developmental stages of mouse molars, using a unique antibody specific for the C-terminal sequence of ameloblastin (GNKVHQPQVHNAWRF) (6Uchida T. Murakami C. Dohi N. Wakida K. Satoda T. Takahashi O. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The findings emanating from this investigation are important for understanding the assembly of matrix proteins leading to maturation of enamel.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice—We have used 50 normal, healthy, female Swiss Webster pregnant mice (Charles River Breeding) to obtain 350 litters, required for this study. All protocols involving mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). Mandibles were obtained from mice at different developmental stages, ranging from newborn (NB) 2The abbreviations used are:NBnewbornPNpostnatalLSCMlaser scan confocal microscopyPBSphosphate-buffered salineHSAhuman serum albuminFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateATMPamelogenin trityrosyl motif peptideCtC-terminal sequence of ameloblastin. day 0 through postnatal (PN) days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Saggital sections (6 μm) from the first mandibular molars of day “0” (NB) and days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 (PN) were used for immunochemical and laser scan confocal microscopy (LSCM) analyses.To study the stage-specific secretion of ameloblastin during different PN days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, we have isolated and pooled both ameloblasts and enamel strip from the first mandibular molars (100 molars for each postnatal day). After removing the first molars from mandibles, they were placed in dispase II solution at 4 °C for 30 min (days 0 and 1) or 1 h (other PN days). This treatment facilitates separation of ameloblasts from the extracellular enamel matrix and further cleaning under the dissection microscope. Ameloblast cell layer and the underlying matrix can easily be separated from the tooth organ for all of the PN days except for newborn (day 0), in which the matrix alone is broken into two or three pieces but not the ameloblasts.Protein Preparations from Ameloblasts—Isolated ameloblasts, after assessing purity and homogeneity by examining sections under microscope, were pooled, frozen, and thawed (four cycles) to extract the proteins, and the extraction procedure was modified from an earlier protocol (7Ravindranath R.M.H. Basilrose Sr R.M. Ravindranath N.H. Vaitheeswaran B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 276: 20293-20302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The protein extracts were homogenized with approximately 3 volumes of ice-cold Tris-HCl (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, with 1 m urea, 100 μm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenates were incubated for about 30 min at 37 °C, centrifuged for 5 min at 8000 × g in a Beckman Microfuge 12, and the supernatant was collected. The proteins from the supernatants were isolated using a Microcon concentrator with a cut-off size of 10 kDa and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 12 min. The protein fraction was collected and stored at -80 °C until further use. Protein concentration was estimated (8Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.H. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and equivalent amounts of isolated proteins (80 μg) were used for electrophoresis and Western blot analysis.Protein Preparations from Developing Extracellular Matrix—Postsecretory stage extracellular matrix samples, which were primarily dentino-enamel, were suspended in Tris-HCl (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 250 mm EDTA, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol as described (7Ravindranath R.M.H. Basilrose Sr R.M. Ravindranath N.H. Vaitheeswaran B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 276: 20293-20302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The final pH was adjusted to 8.0. The suspended matrix was homogenized and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The pooled extract was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant of soluble proteins was collected after three washes and further isolated using a Microcon concentrator with a cut-off size of 10 kDa and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The protein fraction was collected and stored at -80 °C until further use. Equivalent amounts of isolated proteins (100 μg) were used for electrophoresis and Western blot analysis.Assessment of Stage-specific Expression of Ameloblastin Isoforms—Protein isolated from ameloblasts and extracellular matrix extracts during different developmental days (NB to PN day 9) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 100 mA for 35 min using a semidry transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Protein transfer was assessed by staining the polyvinylidene difluoride strips with 0.1% Fast Green as mentioned previously (5Ravindranath H.H. Chen L. Zeichner-David M. Ishima R. Ravindranath R.M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Replicas were treated with ameloblastin antibody (Ct antibody, recognizes the C-terminal residues 406-420, GNKVHQPQVHNAWRF of ameloblastin) and resuspended in PBS (pH 7.2) for 18 h at 4 °C after blocking the membrane with PBS containing 1% HSA for 1 h at 37 °C. The membranes were washed five times with PBS containing 0.1% HSA. Enzyme-linked secondary antibody from Roche Applied Science (BM Chemiluminescence Western blotting kit, 1:2000) was used, as mentioned previously (5Ravindranath H.H. Chen L. Zeichner-David M.

Details of the immunolocalization methodology were described in our previous publications (7Ravindranath R.M.H. Basilrose Sr R.M. Ravindranath N.H. Vaitheeswaran B. J. Biol.

The IgGs were diluted 1:50 in PBS (pH 7.2) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% HSA and 0.1% Tween 20, the sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG) diluted in PBS, pH 7.2 (1:1000). IgG isotype 1 were used as a negative control. The images were examined under fluorescence microscopy.Colocalization of Ameloblastin and Amelogenins with LSCM—To examine the spatiotemporal distribution and colocalization of ameloblastin and amelogenin, sections of mouse postnatal mandibular molars at different postnatal days were prepared as described previously (7Ravindranath R.M.H.

In this experiment, we used rabbit primary antibody for both amelogenin and ameloblastin. Consequently, we have modified the protocol of immunostaining as recommended earlier (10Negoescu A.

The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H2O2. The sections were blocked with 1% human serum albumin and were stained with primary antibody against amelogenin (rabbit antibody, 1:500) for 1 h at 37 °C. The sections were incubated with TRITC (goat anti-rabbit IgG; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), 1:40 dilution, for 30 min at room temperature. After washing three times (10 min each), the sections were sequentially stained with the rabbit primary anti-ameloblastin (Ct) antibody (6Uchida T. Murakami C. Dohi N. Wakida K. Satoda T. Takahashi O. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (1:50) at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing, the slides were incubated with the secondary antibody coupled with FITC-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1:40 dilution, for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Replacements of the primary antibody with Tris-buffered saline and also IgG isotypes were performed as negative controls. Sections were then washed and mounted immediately with glycerol (95% glycerol + 5% PBS) and examined with a Zeiss LSCM (model 510; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a 514 λ argon laser and a 543 λ helium-neon laser.Binding of [3H]ATMP to Newly Secreted Ameloblastin at Tomes' Process—Amelogenin trityrosyl motif peptide is localized in the N-terminal region of amelogenin, which has ligand binding properties with GlcNAc, NeuAc (12Ravindranath R.M.H.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The GMp domain is present intermittently in the polypeptide sequence of ameloblastin and has affinity for ATMP. Therefore, the following autoradiographic study was undertaken to see whether the 13-residue ATMP (P[3H]YPSYGYEP MGGW) binds to ameloblastin secreted during different postnatal days at the Tomes' process and extracellularly. Radiolabeled ATMP was prepared from tritium gas by Amersham Biosciences, and after labeling, the material co-chromatographed with the ATMP was synthesized by the University of Southern California Microchemical Core Laboratory. A mass spectrum is consistent with the proposed structure. The material was supplied as a water/ethanol (1:1, v/v) solution in a silcanized borosilicate multidose vial with additional screw cap under nitrogen. Polypeptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 300-Å (protein or peptide; 250 × 4.6 mm) column with a gradient of solution A (0.01 m aqueous trifluoroacetic acid) and solution B (0.01 m trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile), 0-100% B over 30 min, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The peptide was supplied in an aqueous solution. The peptides were stored in the absence of light and air at -20 or 4 °C, respectively.Sections from mouse mandibular molar (saggital sections, 6 μm) were used to assess the localization of [3H]ATMP during enamel formation. Sections were treated with 50 milliunits of N-acetylglucosaminidase (Sigma) (14Ravindranath R.M.H. Graves M.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5430-5440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to ascertain specific binding to GlcNAc-mimicking peptide domain. The sections were blocked with PBS (pH 6.0) with 1.0% HSA at 37 °C for 1 h and then incubated with [3H]ATMP for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing the slides three times with PBS (0.1% HSA, pH 6.0), the slides were dried for 30 min at room temperature. Each slide was dipped separately in emulsion fluid diluted in water at 1:1 dilution (Autoradiography Emulsions, Type NTB2 for β emitters; International Biotech Inc., Eastman Kodak Co.) in the dark for 1 min, dried, and stored at 4 °C. The autoradiographs were developed in Kodak DEKTOL Developer according to the manufacturer's recommendations and counterstained with hematoxylin. Digital and phase-contrast microscopy was used to identify the grains on sections.RESULTSImmunolocalization of Ct Antibody during Different Days of Postnatal Growth of Enamel—To localize and assess the distribution of Ct-reactive fraction of ameloblastin in ameloblasts and enamel, histological sections of tooth during different postnatal days of development were immunostained with Ct antibody and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Sections stained with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody served as control. Distinct FITC fluorescence of granular structures was observed in the ameloblast cells and in newly formed enamel (days 0 and 1), suggesting that synthesis and secretion of ameloblastin has already commenced. The ameloblastin granules are distinctly aggregated on the walls of the ameloblasts on day 3 (Fig. 1). The clustering of the ameloblastin granules or vesicles is unique and consistent. These fluorescent granular structures are released into the enamel, as evidenced by accumulation of dense aggregates on the formative enamel. The beaded appearance of fluorescent ameloblastin is seen both in ameloblasts and in enamel on day 5 (data not shown). The specific distribution of the dense fluorescent deposits in the formative enamel is unique. The density of the granules is very high in enamel. On day 7 and, particularly, on day 9, ameloblasts showed signs of disruption and shrinkage (see also Ref. 9Ravindranath R.M.H. Tam W. Bringas Jr., P. Santos V. Fincham A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36586-36597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Stage-specific Expression of Ameloblastin Isoforms: Ameloblasts during Postnatal Development—One of the most critical requirements for assessing the ameloblastin profile during postnatal development was to carefully isolate the ameloblast cell layers from the newborn (day 0) through day 9 from the mouse mandibular molars, which involves removal of adherent tissues under a dissection microscope. Fig. 2A shows the isolated ameloblast layer on day 0. The dentino-enamel matrix was also isolated intact as a thin membranous matrix cup and cleaned of adherent tissues on different PN days of tooth organ (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2A, ameloblast layer isolated from the first mandibular molar on postnatal day 0 (NB).

Murakami C. Dohi N. Wakida K. Satoda T. Takahashi O. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Ct immunostaining of the Western blot presented in Fig. 3 revealed the presence of three different isoforms of ameloblastin in the ameloblast layers obtained from postnatal tooth organ on day 3. A 37-kDa fraction observed on days 0-3 could not be detected on from day 5 onward. The antibody Ct detected two intensely staining bands at 66 and 55 kDa. These two protein fractions increase in their intensity after day 3. On day 1, both 66 and 55 kDa appeared as faint bands. The sequence of expression of ameloblastin isoforms is as follows: day 0 (37 kDa); day 1 (37 kDa/faint 55 and 66 kDa), day 3 (faint 37 kDa/55 kDa/66 kDa), day 5 to day 9 (55 kDa/66 kDa).FIGURE 3Stage-specific variation of ameloblastin isoforms from the proteins isolated from ameloblasts at different postnatal stages of the first mandibular molar during enamel development as assessed by Western blot analyses. Proteins on SDS-PAGE were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 100 mA for 35 min using a semidry transblot apparatus. Lanes 1-6, isolated ameloblast proteins from NB day 0 through PN day 9 immunostained with ameloblastin antibody (Ct antibody). Lanes 5 and 7 are part of the same gel and immunostained at the same time as other lanes with the same amount of protein (80 μg of protein/lane). The 55-kDa fraction is more intense on day 9 than on day 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stage-specific Variation of Ameloblastin Isoforms: Extracellular Matrix at Different Postnatal Development—The proteins were extracted from the extracellular matrix of the first mandibular molars at different PN stages of development, after extracting and purifying the extracellular matrix. Fig. 4A showed the Western blots (lane 2, Fast green; lane 3, immunostaining) of the entire sequence of the recombinant ameloblastin (used as control). Fig. 4B showed the stage-specific expression of ameloblastin isoforms in enamel matrix during different postnatal stages of development. As in ameloblasts, the Ct antibody detected two intensely staining bands at 66 and 55 kDa on days 3, 5, and 7, and the staining is not intense on day 9. Importantly, on days 0 and 1, a 37-kDa fraction was observed but not 66- and 55-kDa fractions, suggesting that the 37 kDa is secreted first of the three isoforms as early as days 0 and 1. From day 3 onwards, the fractions of 66 and 55 kDa are intensely present in the enamel, suggesting that these ameloblastin isoforms are later arrivals in the enamel matrix. The 37-kDa fraction in enamel remained throughout the PN days but became intense on days 0-3 and feeble by day 9.FIGURE 4Stage-specific variation of ameloblastin isoforms from the proteins isolated from extracellular matrix of the first mandibular molars at different postnatal stages of tooth development by Western blot analyses. Proteins on SDS-PAGE were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 100 mA for 35 min using a semidry transblot apparatus. A, lanes 1 and 2, standards and ameloblastin stained with Fast Green in Western blots. Lane 3, recombinant ameloblastin immunostained with antibody for ameloblastin (Ct antibody recognizes the C-terminal 15 amino acid residues of ameloblastin). B, lanes 4 and 5, Ct antibody detected only the 37-kDa fraction on days 0 and 1. The 37-kDa fraction is seen faintly throughout the postnatal days of enamel development, until PN day 9. Lanes 6 and 7, two intensely staining bands at 66 and 55 kDa were observed from day 3 onward. On day 9, the protein fractions were highly diffused and still can be seen feebly, probably due to enamel biomineralization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Amelogenin Co-localizes with the Ameloblastin Granules in Ameloblasts, Tomes' Process, and Enamel—Co-localization of amelogenin with ameloblastin (yellow fluorescence) can be observed in sections of molars on days 0 and 3 of the postnatal growth. The sections were stained sequentially with the fluorescent dye-conjugated antibodies (green, ameloblastin (FITC); red, amelogenin (Rhodamine Red)) and examined under laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5, A and B). A and B showed that the stratum intermedium, the ameloblasts, the interface between ameloblasts and odontoblasts, and the odontoblasts all stained with both anti-amelogenin and anti-ameloblastin antibodies. Since both primary antibodies were rabbit antibodies, it may be construed that the staining is due to background coloration. But we have specifically avoided nonspecific staining as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The staining could be due to presence of both the proteins in other regions of the tooth organ, which is well supported in the literature (15Oida S.

Prior to the formation of enamel (day 0), amelogenin co-localized with ameloblastin (yellow signal) in the proximal region of the cytoplasm (Fig. 5C). Since the Western blot in Fig. 4 showed only the 37-kDa fraction on day 0, it is suggestive that the co-localization of amelogenin with ameloblastin may involve the 37-kDa fraction. On day 1, the yellow granules are distinctly observed toward the periphery at Tomes' process. At Tomes' process, the region of ameloblasts where the matrix proteins are released, co-localization of amelogenin and ameloblastin was observed as distinct yellow fluorescence (Fig. 5D), suggestive of their co-assembly in vivo, and justifies investigating their interaction during the developmental stages. The yellow granules of varying size suggested aggregation. Fig. 5E (day 3) provides a unique profile of enamel due to a histological aberration. This enamel layer appears to have peeled off from the ameloblasts. The enamel matrix is spread as a layer showing granulation. This region uniquely exhibits granular yellow signals. In addition, the yellow granules (ameloblastin+/amelogenin+) are also accumulated at some regions of the periphery of the ameloblasts (Fig. 5E). On days 5, 7, and 9 at the incisal region (60%), the yellow florescent granules could not be observed (data not shown). These co-localization findings, together with Western blot studies on ameloblastin isoforms during different PN days in ameloblasts (Fig. 3) and enamel (Fig. 4B), suggest that both amelogenin and ameloblastin may be secreted simultaneously by the ameloblasts (from day 0 to 3).FIGURE 5Co-localization of ameloblastin and amelogenin during development of enamel as revealed by laser-scanning confocal microscopy.

A conference held last month in Lisbon aimed to encourage international efforts to promote research integrity and to prevent misconduct. Scientific misconduct is a global problem, yet protocols for addressing it remain highly fragmented and uneven. A conference held last month in Lisbon aimed to encourage international efforts to promote research integrity and to prevent misconduct. High-profile cases of scientific misconduct such as that of disgraced South Korean stem cell researcher Hwang Woo Suk have focused new attention on efforts to promote ethics in scientific research. At the time that Hwang published his now infamous research, South Korea lacked a formal policy for reporting scientific misconduct, and the country had no policies in place to protect whistle blowers, says David Resnik, a bioethicist at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Durham, North Carolina. With science becoming an increasingly global pursuit, international efforts to promote research integrity have gained momentum. “There's no need to panic or say the sky is falling,” says Stefan Michalowski, executive secretary at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Global Science Forum in Paris, France. “But on a practical level, there's a need to acknowledge the international dimension of the problem,” he says. The OECD's Global Science Forum (GSF) comprises science policy officials from OECD countries who cooperate at a government level on issues related to basic scientific research. In an effort to encourage organizations and governments to consider implementing standard protocols for dealing with scientific misconduct, the GSF has prepared a draft report to provide a starting point for discussions (http://www.oecd.org/sti/gsf). This report helped to catalyze organization of the first world conference on research integrity, which was held last month in Lisbon, Portugal (http://www.esf.org/conferences/researchintegrity). Co-organized by Nicholas Steneck at the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in Rockville, Maryland and Tony Mayer of the European Science Foundation (ESF) in Strasbourg, France, the conference brought together representatives from 52 countries around the globe. “It was the first time we've gathered this many people together to discuss integrity in research,” says Mayer. “We had people from all walks of life in the research world—funders, universities, administrators and researchers.” Sponsored by ESF and ORI, the meeting was also supported by other prominent organizations including the International Council for Science (ICSU), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). The aim of the Lisbon meeting was not to produce a one-size-fits-all approach to solving issues of scientific misconduct—there was widespread agreement that solutions must be individualized to the needs of each country and institution. Instead, the forum focused on jumpstarting cross-border discussion of the problem, says Mayer. “Science, as it's practiced, is increasingly international and a lot of research structures are international, so if misconduct occurs, it can easily have international implications,” says Michalowski. “You need to get data and testimony and you need to get the facts and that may require getting those data from another country,” he says. Investigating misconduct can be difficult enough in one's own country, but the problem becomes even more challenging when the misconduct involves researchers from another country. “Someone may have authority to investigate misconduct in their own country, but they have no such authority in other countries and they may not know who to talk to,” says Michalowski. Meeting attendees all concurred on certain tenets, notes Mayer. “Everyone can agree that fabrication, falsification and plagiarism is wrong—that goes across cultures.” Likewise, there was wide agreement that those types of blatant scientific misconduct are rare, he says. But other forms of scientific misconduct are less easy to define, says Mayer. Pressure to publish and new technology have made it easier and perhaps more tempting for scientists to push the envelope a bit. “People sort of touching up their gels—things like that are a lot easier now than it used to be,” says Tim Hunt of Cancer Research UK, a speaker at the meeting. “There's a bell curve with absolutely exemplary practice at one end and misconduct at the other and a big bell in the middle representing degrees of questionable practice,” says Mayer. “How do we address that? How do we ensure that people don't slide down one side of the bell into the misconduct side?” One proposed solution that is becoming clear is the need to make changes to the research environment. “There are environmental factors that have a bearing on the way researchers behave, and these factors are definitely addressable and changeable,” says ORI's Steneck. As an example, Resnik points to grant review processes that pressure researchers to produce preliminary data, which he says can encourage researchers, especially those who depend on soft money, to lie or stretch the truth on grant applications. “Pressure is probably at an all-time high, and a lot of [misconduct] is probably people responding to this pressure,” says Resnik. Convicted fabricators often point to external pressures as the tipping point for their misdeeds. Eric Poehlman, who fabricated and falsified nearly a decade's worth of work while at the University of Vermont, explained his behavior by saying he felt pressure to continue securing grants so that he could fund the numerous postdocs and graduate students who depended on his support to continue their careers. While many, like Hunt, argue that a lab leader would have to be crazy to commit an ethical breach with so much at stake, Resnik believes that most cases involve ordinary people who gave in to extraordinary pressure. “There's evidence that if you make small compromises that leads to larger compromises,” says Steneck. “Some people get caught in the timing of submitting things and they rush, and because they rush they take shortcuts that they might not otherwise take,” says Peggy Fischer, associate inspector general of the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Virginia. Institutions can relieve pressure or provide guidance on how to cope with it, but this won't entirely eliminate the problem, says Fischer. Effective solutions depend on leadership, says Fischer. “An individual has to believe that that system has integrity. You have to have a culture where people feel the administration feels, breathes and walks integrity,” she says. “There's no magic solution,” agrees Michalowski. “But you need strong leaders,” he emphasizes. Likewise, vigilant, meaningful education must be built into the system. “You should have clear rules where people understand what's expected and required,” says Fischer. Furthermore, people must be familiar with the rules and trust them to work. One priority discussed in the OECD GSF draft report is the need to strengthen the first link in the chain of response to scientific misconduct. “If you're a graduate student and you're working late in the lab and going through the data and you're beginning to suspect that your esteemed research advisor is faking data, what do you do?” says Michalowski. Unless a person who detects misconduct feels safe blowing the whistle, the problem may go unreported. The Lisbon meeting did not attempt to find an ideal method for handling misconduct but instead provided a forum for delegates to exchange ideas for how to deal with it. Some countries still lack a formalized, documented, publicized process for dealing with misconduct. “They deal with this problem in an ad-hoc basis and when an allegation is made, maybe it gets into the press, then people scramble and they put together a committee composed of trusted prestigious people, and they deliberate and make some sort of decision,” says Michalowski. Other countries have formal processes for receiving and handling allegations. “There really is a spectrum of systems, from improvisation to a quasi-legal system,” he says. But even if a formal process for dealing with misconduct exists in the country or institution of the scientist suspected of misdeeds, that scientist's culture may not consider the behavior unethical. For instance, some Asian countries don't view individuality and individual rights and responsibilities in the same way that Western countries do, and this difference of values can create problems regarding authorship and plagiarism, says Resnik. “Some people may think it's a common piece of research and it doesn't matter so much who takes credit for that.” Likewise, “some countries don't have the same regard for human rights as we do and while we have international codes and standards for human research it's not always clear how well other countries are adhering,” says Resnik. “Politics is always a potential factor here.” Steneck considers culture gaps a surmountable obstacle. “There are cultural differences that are going to make the process difficult but every country needs to think about what their cultural differences are, and whether they can be justified,” he says. “You will hear, for example, that we have different attitudes toward authorship in [the US]—we tend to give senior people more credit,” he says. “But you wouldn't say, well in our country, we just don't believe in double blind experiments. Does authorship fall into the same realm? It is misleading to put someone on a paper who really didn't contribute anything, and I don't think that cultural differences should stand in the way of this,” Steneck says. Perhaps even more challenging than cultural differences is a shared tendency to view science as a noble pursuit immune to fraud. Many countries and organizations still subscribe to the notion that science is a brotherhood of gentlemen who can't lie, says Michalowski. “This idea goes back to when science was a much smaller institution and it has survived long after science changed,” says Michalowski. “We don't believe that science is a special case—in any profession you can have some dishonesty.” Resnik says that much of the misconduct that turns up in science is simply spill over from problems facing society as a whole. “Surveys consistently show that the incidence of cheating in high school and college is very high, well over 50 percent and it's unreasonable to expect that these people who were cheating in college will never cheat again,” says Resnik. “It's not surprising that you find fraud in science—scientists are people too–but we tend to hold scientists up on a pedestal,” he says. Even with the apparent rise in high-profile cases of research misconduct, many in the scientific community have been reluctant to discuss the problem publicly. “I honestly think it's better to just quietly deal with a person than to bring in the SWAT team and start some huge public investigation,” says Hunt. A heavy-handed approach, he says, reinforces the idea in the public's mind that scientists are dishonest. “Every time the whistle is blown, the public says scientists can't be trusted,” says Hunt. Michalowski disagrees with this argument. “People may worry that even if your motives are pure, you risk doing harm to the system by exposing fraud, but when the public learns that data were faked in a drug trial, the damage is even greater,” he says. Those who handle scientific misconduct report a rise in the number of cases in recent years, but this may be a sign of better surveillance, rather than an increase in actual incidence. “Our numbers have gone up significantly in the past few years, but we don't know what the baseline is,” says Fischer. Misconduct can easily slip under the radar if whistle blowers don't feel safe reporting it, she says. “The system has to have a way to receive allegations in which the person submitting the allegation feels comfortable doing that, so that the fears inherent in reporting–like losing funding or retaliation are reduced to the lowest level possible,” she says. Fischer believes that misconduct is underreported but says that no good comprehensive studies of scientific misconduct exist and without them, it's difficult to quantify the number of actual cases. The Lisbon meeting and GSF draft report provide first steps toward international cooperation on maintaining scientific integrity and preventing research misconduct. However, individual countries are also moving forward with their own policies. For example, Germany has implemented an innovative ombudsman system meant to address problems before they blow up. The system consists of ombudsmen at both the national and institutional level, says Ulrike Beisiegel, chair of the DFG Ombudsman. The national ombudsman is an independent, neutral person trained to mediate and navigate ethical challenges. “Every researcher in Germany can contact us if he has information about someone who might have done something wrong,” says Beisiegel. The ombudsman can advise whistle blowers, conduct preliminary investigations, and try to mediate the problem and settle it in an amicable way, if possible. So far, the national ombudsman office has handled about 60 to 70 cases per year, says Beisiegel. The system has safeguards in place to protect both the whistle blower and the alleged perpetrator of the misconduct. “Our goal is to go in early,” says Beisiegel. “Most of the people come to us too late. If it's an authorship issue, it's after the paper is published. So we're setting up a curriculum for students so they know how they should behave and what they should do,” says Beisiegel. The Lisbon conference has encouraged decision-makers to think about the big issues facing them. “The conversations have started, and now we can continue these conversations—that's what we're hoping will come out of the world conference. It's a first step,” says Steneck. During the meeting, some suggested that the logical next step should be a series of regional meetings, for instance a group of Asian nations coming together to discuss scientific integrity, says Mayer. “There is a feeling we need to come together again, but where and when is still up for debate.” “I'm optimistic,” Steneck says. “Five or six years ago there was very little global interest and that's changed. I think there are significant components of the research community who realize we do need to take these issues seriously.”"
