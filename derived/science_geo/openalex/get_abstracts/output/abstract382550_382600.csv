https://openalex.org/W2053700726,"Crystalline solids with extended non-interpenetrating three-dimensional crystal structures were synthesized that support well-defined pores with internal diameters of up to 48 angstroms. The Zn4O(CO2)6 unit was joined with either one or two kinds of organic link, 4,4',4''-[benzene-1,3,5-triyl-tris(ethyne-2,1-diyl)]tribenzoate (BTE), 4,4',44''-[benzene-1,3,5-triyl-tris(benzene-4,1-diyl)]tribenzoate (BBC), 4,4',44''-benzene-1,3,5-triyl-tribenzoate (BTB)/2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate (NDC), and BTE/biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylate (BPDC), to give four metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), MOF-180, -200, -205, and -210, respectively. Members of this series of MOFs show exceptional porosities and gas (hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide) uptake capacities. For example, MOF-210 has Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Langmuir surface areas of 6240 and 10,400 square meters per gram, respectively, and a total carbon dioxide storage capacity of 2870 milligrams per gram. The volume-specific internal surface area of MOF-210 (2060 square meters per cubic centimeter) is equivalent to the outer surface of nanoparticles (3-nanometer cubes) and near the ultimate adsorption limit for solid materials."
https://openalex.org/W2041257508,"Background Multiple genome alignment remains a challenging problem. Effects of recombination including rearrangement, segmental duplication, gain, and loss can create a mosaic pattern of homology even among closely related organisms. Methodology/Principal Findings We describe a new method to align two or more genomes that have undergone rearrangements due to recombination and substantial amounts of segmental gain and loss (flux). We demonstrate that the new method can accurately align regions conserved in some, but not all, of the genomes, an important case not handled by our previous work. The method uses a novel alignment objective score called a sum-of-pairs breakpoint score, which facilitates accurate detection of rearrangement breakpoints when genomes have unequal gene content. We also apply a probabilistic alignment filtering method to remove erroneous alignments of unrelated sequences, which are commonly observed in other genome alignment methods. We describe new metrics for quantifying genome alignment accuracy which measure the quality of rearrangement breakpoint predictions and indel predictions. The new genome alignment algorithm demonstrates high accuracy in situations where genomes have undergone biologically feasible amounts of genome rearrangement, segmental gain and loss. We apply the new algorithm to a set of 23 genomes from the genera Escherichia, Shigella, and Salmonella. Analysis of whole-genome multiple alignments allows us to extend the previously defined concepts of core- and pan-genomes to include not only annotated genes, but also non-coding regions with potential regulatory roles. The 23 enterobacteria have an estimated core-genome of 2.46Mbp conserved among all taxa and a pan-genome of 15.2Mbp. We document substantial population-level variability among these organisms driven by segmental gain and loss. Interestingly, much variability lies in intergenic regions, suggesting that the Enterobacteriacae may exhibit regulatory divergence. Conclusions The multiple genome alignments generated by our software provide a platform for comparative genomic and population genomic studies. Free, open-source software implementing the described genome alignment approach is available from http://gel.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve."

To identify gene regions that might have contributed to high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans, Simonson et al. (p. 72 , published online 13 May) conducted a genome scan of nucleotide polymorphism comparing Tibetans, Han Chinese, and Japanese, while Yi et al. (p. 75 ) performed comparable analyses on the coding regions of all genes—their exomes. Both studies converged on a gene, endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim domain protein 1 (also known as hypoxia-inducible factor 2 α), which has been linked to the regulation of red blood cell production. Other genes identified that were potentially under selection included adult and fetal hemoglobin and two functional candidate loci that were correlated with low hemoglobin concentration in Tibetans. Future detailed functional studies will now be required to examine the mechanistic underpinnings of physiological adaptation to high altitudes."
https://openalex.org/W1965910674,"Probed But Not Perturbed The processing and manipulation of quantum information holds great promise in terms of outperforming classical computers and secure communication. However, quantum information is delicate, and even reading the information is a destructive and probabilistic process requiring a number of measurements to home in on the information stored as a quantum state. For the nitrogen vacancy in diamond, Neumann et al. (p. 542 , published online 1 July) show that these limitations can be eliminated. A measurement protocol was designed and implemented where the spin state of the nuclear spin of the vacancy could be mapped onto and read out from the surrounding electronic spins in a single-shot measurement nondestructively."
https://openalex.org/W1982956224,"Peripheral Quality Control Protein misfolding diseases often lead to the retention and degradation of important proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Strategies to reduce the stringency of ER quality control that allow the proteins to carry on through the secretory pathway to reach their destination at the cell surface have shown some promise. Okiyoneda et al. (p. 805 , published online 1 July; see the Perspective by Hutt and Balch ) wanted to understand how, even if a protein reaches its destination, it may still be subjected to a second level of quality control and be cleared from the plasma membrane. Using functional small-interfering RNA screens in cells expressing the common cystic fibrosis mutation F508CFTR, the authors identified a pair of chaperones that promoted clearance of defective proteins from the plasma membrane. This peripheral quality-control step will also need to be overcome to increase the effectiveness of strategies to overcome protein misfolding disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2103947753,"Background The characterization of natural recessive resistance genes and Arabidopsis virus-resistant mutants have implicated translation initiation factors of the eIF4E and eIF4G families as susceptibility factors required for virus infection and resistance function. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate further the role of translation initiation factors in virus resistance we set up a TILLING platform in tomato, cloned genes encoding for translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4G and screened for induced mutations that lead to virus resistance. A splicing mutant of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor, S.l_eIF4E1 G1485A, was identified and characterized with respect to cap binding activity and resistance spectrum. Molecular analysis of the transcript of the mutant form showed that both the second and the third exons were miss-spliced, leading to a truncated mRNA. The resulting truncated eIF4E1 protein is also impaired in cap-binding activity. The mutant line had no growth defect, likely because of functional redundancy with others eIF4E isoforms. When infected with different potyviruses, the mutant line was immune to two strains of Potato virus Y and Pepper mottle virus and susceptible to Tobacco each virus. Conclusions/Significance Mutation analysis of translation initiation factors shows that translation initiation factors of the eIF4E family are determinants of plant susceptibility to RNA viruses and viruses have adopted strategies to use different isoforms. This work also demonstrates the effectiveness of TILLING as a reverse genetics tool to improve crop species. We have also developed a complete tool that can be used for both forward and reverse genetics in tomato, for both basic science and crop improvement. By opening it to the community, we hope to fulfill the expectations of both crop breeders and scientists who are using tomato as their model of study."
https://openalex.org/W2071551596,"Filling a Cavity Unlike liquid ammonia, water cannot sustain a steady concentration of isolated electrons. Nonetheless, high-energy irradiation can introduce a small number of free charges that engage in potent reductive chemistry and have clear spectroscopic signatures. The manner in which water solubilizes these hydrated electrons has remained uncertain, but the general consensus has been that repulsive interactions drive the nearest water molecules away, leaving the electron in a nearly spherical empty cavity. Larsen et al. (p. 65 ; see the Perspective by Jordan and Johnson ) upend this consensus with simulations based on a more thorough potential function for modeling the competing attractions and repulsions between the electron and surrounding water. The calculations suggest that the hydrated electron actually draws water in, occupying a region denser than the pure bulk liquid. The model reproduces experimental spectral and dynamic observations as effectively as, and in some cases better than, the cavity framework."

The p38 MAPK pathway regulates mRNA stability via the downstream kinase MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP kinase 2 or MK2), which phosphorylates and prevents the mRNA-destabilizing function of TTP. We show that deadenylation of endogenous ARE-containing tumor necrosis factor mRNA is inhibited by p38 MAPK. To investigate whether phosphorylation of TTP by MK2 regulates TTP-directed deadenylation of ARE-containing mRNAs, we used a cell-free assay that reconstitutes the mechanism in vitro. We find that phosphorylation of Ser-52 and Ser-178 of TTP by MK2 results in inhibition of TTP-directed deadenylation of ARE-containing RNA. The use of 14-3-3 protein antagonists showed that regulation of TTP-directed deadenylation by MK2 is independent of 14-3-3 binding to TTP. To investigate the mechanism whereby TTP promotes deadenylation, it was necessary to identify the deadenylases involved. The carbon catabolite repressor protein (CCR)4·CCR4-associated factor (CAF)1 complex was identified as the major source of deadenylase activity in HeLa cells responsible for TTP-directed deadenylation. CAF1a and CAF1b were found to interact with TTP in an RNA-independent fashion. We find that MK2 phosphorylation reduces the ability of TTP to promote deadenylation by inhibiting the recruitment of CAF1 deadenylase in a mechanism that does not involve sequestration of TTP by 14-3-3.

https://openalex.org/W2095136054,"Abnormal activation of calpain is implicated in synaptic dysfunction and participates in neuronal death in Alzheimer disease (AD) and other neurological disorders. Pharmacological inhibition of calpain has been shown to improve memory and synaptic transmission in the mouse model of AD. However, the role and mechanism of calpain in AD progression remain elusive. Here we demonstrate a role of calpain in the neuropathology in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) double-transgenic mice, an established mouse model of AD. We found that overexpression of endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin (CAST) under the control of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II promoter in APP/PS1 mice caused a remarkable decrease of amyloid plaque burdens and prevented Tau phosphorylation and the loss of synapses. Furthermore, CAST overexpression prevented the decrease in the phosphorylation of the memory-related molecules CREB and ERK in the brain of APP/PS1 mice and improved spatial learning and memory. Interestingly, treatment of cultured primary neurons with amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides caused an increase in the level of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the key enzyme responsible for APP processing and Abeta production. This effect was inhibited by CAST overexpression. Consistently, overexpression of calpain in heterologous APP expressing cells up-regulated the level of BACE1 and increased Abeta production. Finally, CAST transgene prevented the increase of BACE1 in APP/PS1 mice. Thus, calpain activation plays an important role in APP processing and plaque formation, probably by regulating the expression of BACE1."
https://openalex.org/W2052446448,"Brain Over Muscle Mutations in the gene encoding the Kir6.2 subunit of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–sensitive potassium (K ATP ) channel cause a specific type of neonatal diabetes in humans, known as iDEND, which is often accompanied by muscle weakness of unknown etiology. By studying mice expressing the mutant gene only in muscle or only in nerve, Clark et al. (p. 458 , published online 1 July) found that the motor impairments originate from inappropriate activation of the channel in the central nervous system rather than in muscle. Patients with iDEND are often treated with sulphonylurea therapies that block K ATP channels in both brain and muscle, and these drugs can have adverse effects on heart muscle. Drugs with greater specificity for K ATP channels in the brain may thus be a safer option."

https://openalex.org/W2049763116,"Background Recessive mutations in guanylate cyclase-1 (Gucy2d) are associated with severe, early onset Leber congenital amaurosis-1(LCA1). Gucy2d encodes guanylate cyclase (GC1) is expressed in photoreceptor outer segment membranes and produces cGMP in these cells. LCA1 patients present in infancy with severely impaired vision and extinguished electroretinogram (ERG) but retain some photoreceptors in both their macular and peripheral retina for years. Like LCA1 patients, loss of cone function in the GC1 knockout (GC1KO) mouse precedes cone degeneration. The purpose of this study was to test whether delivery of functional GC1 to cone cells of the postnatal GC1KO mouse could restore function to these cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Serotype 5 AAV vectors containing either a photoreceptor-specific, rhodopsin kinase (hGRK1) or ubiquitous (smCBA) promoter driving expression of wild type murine GC1 were subretinally delivered to one eye of P14 GC1KO mice. Visual function (ERG) was analyzed in treated and untreated eyes until 3 months post injection. AAV-treated, isogenic wild type and uninjected control mice were evaluated for restoration of visual behavior using optomotor testing. At 3 months post injection, all animals were sacrificed, and their treated and untreated retinas assayed for expression of GC1 and localization of cone arrestin. Cone-mediated function was restored to treated eyes of GC1KO mice (ERG amplitudes were ∼45% of normal). Treatment effect was stable for at least 3 months. Robust improvements in cone-mediated visual behavior were also observed, with responses of treated mice being similar or identical to that of wild type mice. AAV-vectored GC1 expression was found in photoreceptors and cone cells were preserved in treated retinas. Conclusions/Significance This is the first demonstration of gene-based restoration of both visual function/vision-elicited behavior and cone preservation in a mammalian model of GC1 deficiency. Importantly, results were obtained using a well characterized, clinically relevant AAV vector. These results lay the ground work for the development of an AAV-based gene therapy vector for the treatment of LCA1."
https://openalex.org/W2151954973,"Background Although the use of TNF inhibitors has fundamentally changed the way rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is treated, not all patients respond well. It is desirable to facilitate the identification of responding and non-responding patients prior to treatment, not only to avoid unnecessary treatment but also for financial reasons. In this work we have investigated the transcriptional profile of synovial tissue sampled from RA patients before anti-TNF treatment with the aim to identify biomarkers predictive of response. Methodology/Principal Findings Synovial tissue samples were obtained by arthroscopy from 62 RA patients before the initiation of infliximab treatment. RNA was extracted and gene expression profiling was performed using an in-house spotted long oligonucleotide array covering 17972 unique genes. Tissue sections were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry to evaluate cell infiltrates. Response to infliximab treatment was assessed according to the EULAR response criteria. The presence of lymphocyte aggregates dominated the expression profiles and a significant overrepresentation of lymphocyte aggregates in good responding patients confounded the analyses. A statistical model was set up to control for the effect of aggregates, but no differences could be identified between responders and non-responders. Subsequently, the patients were split into lymphocyte aggregate positive- and negative patients. No statistically significant differences could be identified except for 38 transcripts associated with differences between good- and non-responders in aggregate positive patients. A profile was identified in these genes that indicated a higher level of metabolism in good responding patients, which indirectly can be connected to increased inflammation. Conclusions/Significance It is pivotal to account for the presence of lymphoid aggregates when studying gene expression patterns in rheumatoid synovial tissue. In spite of our original hypothesis, the data do not support the notion that microarray analysis of whole synovial biopsy specimens can be used in the context of personalized medicine to identify non-responders to anti-TNF therapy before the initiation of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2020950198,"The initiation of DNA replication requires the melting of chromosomal origins to provide a template for replisomal polymerases. In bacteria, the DnaA initiator plays a key role in this process, forming a large nucleoprotein complex that opens DNA through a complex and poorly understood mechanism. Using structure-guided mutagenesis, biochemical, and genetic approaches, we establish an unexpected link between the duplex DNA-binding domain of DnaA and the ability of the protein to both self-assemble and engage single-stranded DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. Intersubunit cross-talk between this domain and the DnaA ATPase region regulates this link and is required for both origin unwinding in vitro and initiator function in vivo. These findings indicate that DnaA utilizes at least two different oligomeric conformations for engaging single- and double-stranded DNA, and that these states play distinct roles in controlling the progression of initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2050454735,"Breast cancers that overexpress the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2/HER2/Neu result in poor patient outcome because of extensive metastatic progression. Herein, we delineate a molecular mechanism that may govern this malignant phenotype. ErbB2 induction of migration requires activation of the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. The ability of ErbB2 to activate these small GTPases necessitated expression of p120 catenin, which is itself up-regulated by signaling through ErbB2 and the tyrosine kinase Src. Silencing p120 in ErbB2-dependent breast cancer cell lines dramatically inhibited migration and invasion as well as activation of Rac1 and Cdc42. In contrast, overexpression of constitutively active mutants of these GTPases reversed the effects of p120 silencing. Lastly, ectopic expression of p120 promoted migration and invasion and potentiated metastatic progression of a weakly metastatic, ErbB2-dependent breast cancer cell line. These results suggest that p120 acts as an obligate intermediate between ErbB2 and Rac1/Cdc42 to modulate the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells."

Here, we have compared the independent and combined effects of a PPARdelta agonist and endurance training mimetic (GW501516) and a myostatin antibody and resistance training mimetic (PF-879) on metabolic and performance outcomes in obese insulin resistant mice.Male ob/ob mice were treated for 6 weeks with vehicle, GW501516, PF-879, or GW501516 in combination with PF-879. The effects of the interventions on body composition, glucose homeostasis, glucose tolerance, energy expenditure, exercise capacity and metabolic gene expression were compared at the end of study. GW501516 attenuated body weight and fat mass accumulation and increased the expression of genes of oxidative metabolism. In contrast, PF-879 increased body weight by driving muscle growth and altered the expression of genes involved in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. Despite their differences, both interventions alone improved glucose homeostasis. Moreover, GW501516 more effectively improved serum lipids, and PF-879 uniquely increased energy expenditure, exercise capacity and adiponectin levels. When combined the robust effects of GW501516 and/or PF-879 on body weight, adiposity, muscle mass, glycemia, serum lipids, energy expenditure and exercise capacity were highly conserved.The data, for the first time, demonstrate postnatal inhibition of myostatin not only promotes gains in muscle mass similar to resistance training,but improves metabolic homeostasis. In several instances, these effects were either distinct from or complimentary to those of GW501516. The data further suggest that strategies to increase muscle mass, and not necessarily oxidative capacity, may effectively counter insulin resistance and T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2151533650,"Numerical and functional defects of invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) have been documented in human and mouse cancers, resulting in a defect in IFN production in several malignancies. iNKT cells recognize glycolipids presented on CD1d molecules by dendritic and related cells, leading to their activation and thereby regulating immune reactions. Activated iNKT cells cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity can inhibit existing and spontaneous tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. We have identified functional iNKT cell defects in the murine TRAMP prostate cancer model. We found that iNKT cells show the ability to migrate into TRAMP prostate tumors. This infiltration was mediated through CCL2: CCR5 chemokine: receptor interaction. Prostate tumor cells expressing CD1d partially activated iNKT cells, as appreciated by up-regulation of CD25, PD-1 and the IL-12R. However, despite inducing up-regulation of these activation markers and, hence, delivering positive signals, prostate tumor cells inhibited the IL-12-induced STAT4 phosphorylation in a cell-cell contact dependent but CD1d-independent manner. Consequently, tumor cells did not induce secretion of IFNγ by iNKT cells. Blocking the inhibitory Ly49 receptor on iNKT cells in the presence of α-GalCer restored their IFNγ production in vivo and in vitro. However, Ly49 blockade alone was not sufficient. Importantly, this defect could be also be reversed into vigorous secretion of IFNγ by the addition of both IL-12 and the exogenous CD1d ligand alpha-galactosylceramide, but not by IL-12 alone, both in vivo and in vitro. These data underscore the potential to optimize iNKT-based therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2165999340,"X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a dosage compensation mechanism essential for embryonic development and cell physiology. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) derived from inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocyst stage embryos have been used as a model system to understand XCI initiation and maintenance. Previous studies of undifferentiated female hESCs at intermediate passages have shown three possible states of XCI; 1) cells in a pre-XCI state, 2) cells that already exhibit XCI, or 3) cells that never undergo XCI even upon differentiation. In this study, XCI status was assayed in ten female hESC lines between passage 5 and 15 to determine whether XCI variations occur in early passages of hESCs. Our results show that three different states of XCI already exist in the early passages of hESC. In addition, we observe one cell line with skewed XCI and preferential expression of X-linked genes from the paternal allele, while another cell line exhibits random XCI. Skewed XCI in undifferentiated hESCs may be due to clonal selection in culture instead of non-random XCI in ICM cells. We also found that XIST promoter methylation is correlated with silencing of XIST transcripts in early passages of hESCs, even in the pre-XCI state. In conclusion, XCI variations already take place in early passages of hESCs, which may be a consequence of in vitro culture selection during the derivation process. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that XCI variations in hESCs may reflect heterogeneous XCI states in ICM cells that stochastically give rise to hESCs."
https://openalex.org/W2063101168,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) not only play a key role in regulating metabolic pathways but also modulate inflammatory processes, pointing to a functional interaction between PPAR and cytokine signaling pathways. In this study, we show by genome-wide transcriptional profiling that PPARβ/δ and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) pathways functionally interact in human myofibroblasts and that a subset of these genes is cooperatively activated by TGFβ and PPARβ/δ. Using the angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) gene as a model, we demonstrate that two enhancer regions cooperate to mediate the observed synergistic response. A TGFβ-responsive enhancer located ∼8 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site is regulated by a mechanism involving SMAD3, ETS1, RUNX, and AP-1 transcription factors that interact with multiple contiguous binding sites. A second enhancer (PPAR-E) consisting of three juxtaposed PPAR response elements is located in the third intron ∼3.5 kb downstream of the transcriptional start site. The PPAR-E is strongly activated by all three PPAR subtypes, with a novel type of PPAR response element motif playing a central role. Although the PPAR-E is not regulated by TGFβ, it interacts with SMAD3, ETS1, RUNX2, and AP-1 in vivo, providing a possible mechanistic explanation for the observed synergism."

This optimization of the culture medium is sensitive to the presence of Myc in the reprogramming factors. Moreover, we could reprogram meningeal cells using only two factors Oct4/Klf4.

We hypothesized that treatment with a broad-spectrum MMP and TACE-inhibitor (Marimastat) would ameliorate injury and inflammation, leading to decreased fibrogenesis during repeated hepatotoxin-induced liver injury. Methodology/Principal Findings Liver fibrosis was induced in mice by repeated carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) administration, during which the mice received either Marimastat or vehicle twice daily. A single dose of CCl4 was administered to investigate acute liver injury in mice pretreated with Marimastat, mice deficient in Mmp9, or mice deficient in both TNF-α receptors. Liver injury was quantified by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and confirmed by histology. Hepatic collagen was determined as hydroxyproline, and expression of fibrogenesis and fibrolysis-related transcripts was determined by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Marimastat-treated animals demonstrated significantly attenuated liver injury and inflammation but a 25% increase in collagen deposition. Transcripts related to fibrogenesis were significantly less upregulated compared to vehicle-treated animals, while MMP expression and activity analysis revealed efficient pharmacologic MMP-inhibition and decreased fibrolysis following Marimastat treatment. Marimastat pre-treatment significantly attenuated liver injury following acute CCl4-administration, whereas Mmp9 deficient animals demonstrated no protection. Mice deficient in both TNF-α receptors exhibited an 80% reduction of serum ALT, confirming the hepatoprotective effects of Marimastat via the TNF-signaling pathway. Conclusions/Significance Inhibition of MMP and TACE activity with Marimastat during chronic CCl4 administration counterbalanced any beneficial anti-inflammatory effect, resulting in a positive balance of collagen deposition. Since effective inhibition of MMPs accelerates fibrosis progression, MMP inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with chronic liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2132142991,"In Northern European descended populations, genetic susceptibility for multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with alleles of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class II gene DRB1. Whether other major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes contribute to MS susceptibility is controversial.A case control analysis was performed using 958 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the MHC assayed in two independent datasets. The discovery dataset consisted of 1,018 cases and 1,795 controls and the replication dataset was composed of 1,343 cases and 1,379 controls. The most significantly MS-associated SNP in the discovery dataset was rs3135391, a Class II SNP known to tag the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele, the primary MS susceptibility allele in the MHC (O.R. = 3.04, p < 1 x 10(-78)). To control for the effects of the HLA-DRB1*15:01 haplotype, case control analysis was performed adjusting for this HLA-DRB1*15:01 tagging SNP. After correction for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate = .05) 52 SNPs in the Class I, II and III regions were significantly associated with MS susceptibility in both datasets using the Cochran Armitage trend test. The discovery and replication datasets were merged and subjects carrying the HLA-DRB1*15:01 tagging SNP were excluded. Association tests showed that 48 of the 52 replicated SNPs retained significant associations with MS susceptibility independently of the HLA-DRB1*15:01 as defined by the tagging SNP. 20 Class I SNPs were associated with MS susceptibility with p-values < or = 1 x 10(-8). The most significantly associated SNP was rs4959039, a SNP in the downstream un-translated region of the non-classical HLA-G gene (Odds ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.40, 1.81, p = 8.45 x 10(-13)) and is in linkage disequilibrium with several nearby SNPs. Logistic regression modeling showed that this SNP's contribution to MS susceptibility was independent of the Class II and Class III SNPs identified in this screen.A MHC Class I locus contributes to MS susceptibility independently of the HLA-DRB1*15:01 haplotype."
https://openalex.org/W2025401025,"Background In France, there was a reluctance to accept vaccination against the A/H1N1 pandemic influenza virus despite government recommendation and investment in the vaccine programme. Methods and Findings We examined the willingness of different populations to accept A/H1N1vaccination (i) in a French hospital among 3315 employees immunized either by in-house medical personnel or mobile teams of MDs and (ii) in a shelter housing 250 homeless persons. Google was used to assess the volume of enquiries concerning incidence of influenza. We analyzed the information on vaccination provided by Google, the website of the major French newspapers, and PubMed. Two trust Surveys were used to assess public opinion on the trustworthiness of people in different professions. Paramedics were significantly more reluctant to accept immunisation than qualified medical staff. Acceptance was significantly increased when recommended directly by MDs. Anecdotal cases of directly observed severe infections were followed by enhanced acceptance of paramedical staff. Scientific literature was significantly more in favour of vaccination than Google and French newspaper websites. In the case of the newspaper websites, information correlated with their recognised political reputations, although they would presumably claim independence from political bias. The Trust Surveys showed that politicians were highly distrusted in contrast with doctors and pharmacists who were considered much more trustworthy. Conclusions The low uptake of the vaccine could reflect failure to convey high quality medical information and advice relating to the benefits of being vaccinated. We believe that the media and internet contributed to this problem by raising concerns within the general population and that failure to involve GPs in the control programme may have been a mistake. GPs are highly regarded by the public and can provide face-to-face professional advice and information. The top-down strategy of vaccine programme management and information delivered by the Ministry of Health could have aggravated the problem, because the general population does not always trust politicians."
https://openalex.org/W1972675596,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and the Na,K-ATPase functionally interact in skeletal muscle (Krivoi, I. I., Drabkina, T. M., Kravtsova, V. V., Vasiliev, A. N., Eaton, M. J., Skatchkov, S. N., and Mandel, F. (2006) Pflugers Arch. 452, 756-765; Krivoi, I., Vasiliev, A., Kravtsova, V., Dobretsov, M., and Mandel, F. (2003) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 986, 639-641). In this interaction, the specific binding of nanomolar concentrations of nicotinic agonists to the nAChR stimulates electrogenic transport by the Na,K-ATPase alpha2 isozyme, causing membrane hyperpolarization. This study examines the molecular nature and membrane localization of this interaction. Stimulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by the nAChR does not require ion flow through open nAChRs. It can be induced by nAChR desensitization alone, in the absence of nicotinic agonist, and saturates when the nAChR is fully desensitized. It is enhanced by noncompetitive blockers of the nAChR (proadifen, QX-222), which promote non-conducting or desensitized states; and retarded by tetracaine, which stabilizes the resting nAChR conformation. The interaction operates at the neuromuscular junction as well as on extrajunctional sarcolemma. The Na,K-ATPase alpha2 isozyme is enriched at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction and co-localizes with nAChRs. The nAChR and Na,K-ATPase alpha subunits specifically coimmunoprecipitate with each other, phospholemman, and caveolin-3. In a purified membrane preparation from Torpedo californica enriched in nAChRs and the Na,K-ATPase, a ouabain-induced conformational change of the Na,K-ATPase enhances a conformational transition of the nAChR to a desensitized state. These results suggest a mechanism by which the nAChR in a desensitized state with high apparent affinity for agonist interacts with the Na,K-ATPase to stimulate active transport. The interaction utilizes a membrane-delimited complex involving protein-protein interactions, either directly or through additional protein partners. This interaction is expected to enhance neuromuscular transmission and muscle excitation."

LRRK2 is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system where its levels are controlled by the C terminus of HSP70-interacting proteins (CHIP).

LRRK2 contains a conserved activation segment that is classically defined as a region between two conserved tripeptide motifs (DF/YG) and APE. Within this activation segment, LRRK2 contains three potential autophosphorylation sites, including amino acids Thr-2031, Ser-2032, and Thr-2035. Ser-2032 and Thr-2035 regulate LRRK2 autophosphorylation activity, but do not seem to be involved in LRRK2 dimerization (22Luzón-Toro B. Rubio de la Torre E. Delgado A. Pérez-Tur J. Hilfiker S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry identified other amino acids in LRRK2 that are autophosphorylated, and these studies have not shown that these potential phosphorylation sites within the activation loop are indeed phosphorylated where they can regulate the activity of LRRK2 (16West A.B. Moore D.J. Choi C. Andrabi S.A. Li X. Dikeman D. Biskup S. Zhang Z. Lim K.L. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). To begin to address this question we developed phophospecific antibodies to Thr-2031, Ser-2032, and Thr-2035 and now show that all of the three possible sites, Thr-2031, Ser-2032, and Thr-2035, are autophosphorylated by LRRK2 and that Ser-2032 and Thr-2035 regulate LRRK2 kinase activity. Functional mutations were introduced into LRRK2 cDNA by PCR-mediated, site-directed mutagenesis, using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), followed by the sequencing to confirm their correct incorporation. Plasmid DNA was prepared using a Maxi-prep column (Qiagen), and concentration of plasmid DNA was normalized by transient transfection assays with subsequent Western blot analysis. The peptide (sequence see Fig. 1B) was synthesized and used to immunize rabbits. This peptide was conjugated to SulfoLink coupling gel (Pierce) for affinity purification. Briefly, antiserum was incubated with a peptide-conjugated SulfoLink column for 48 h at 4 °C. The column was washed in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 400 mm NaCl) three times with 1 column volume each time. The antibody was eluted with 4 m MgCl2 10 times with 1 ml each time. These 10 1-ml aliquots were collected and subjected to A280 measure. The two fractions with the highest A280 values were pooled together and dialyzed immediately against 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.01% sodium azide solution overnight at 4 °C. The dialysis buffer was changed to 50 mm PBS, 20% sucrose, 0.01% NaN3 and dialyzed for another 24 h at 4 °C. The final antibodies were frozen at −80 °C in 100-μl aliquots. HEK-293FT (Invitrogen) cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For each experiment, cells were plated in 10-cm dishes, and transfection was accomplished using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and incubated into lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 1× Complete protease inhibitors (Roche), and 1× phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 (Sigma), for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Insoluble material was removed with a 153,000 rpm centrifugation for 15 min. Magnetic Dynabeads (50 ml; Invitrogen) were preincubated with anti-myc antibody (clone 9E10; Roche) for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation and added to the precleared lysate. The bead-lysate mixture was allowed to rotate overnight at 4 °C, and the Dynabeads were subsequently washed five times with lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl. Dynabeads were suspended in 50 ml of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, and 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate), and kinase reactions were initiated with the addition of 10 mm ATP (0.5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)) and 20 mm MgCl2. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking, and the supernatants were removed. Beads were suspended in 2× Laemmli buffer and heated for 10 min at 70 °C. Kinase reactions were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The autophosphorylation signal was estimated using a Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant 6.0. Input levels of protein present on the nitrocellulose membrane were determined by Western blotting. Primary cortical neuron cultures were prepared from gestational day 15–16 fetal mice. Cortices were dissected and the cells dissociated by trituration in modified Eagle's medium, 20% horse serum, 25 mm glucose, and 2 mm l-glutamine, following a 15-min digestion in TrypLE (Invitrogen). The cells were plated on 24-well plates coated with poly-l-ornithine and were maintained in modified Eagle's medium, 10% horse serum, 25 mm glucose, and 2 mm l-glutamine in a 7% CO2 humidified 37 °C incubator. The glial cell growth was inhibited by addition of 5-fluoro-20-deoxyuridine (30 mm; Sigma) to the culture medium on in vitro day 4. For assessment of LRRK2 toxicity, LRRK2 and EGFP constructs were combined in a molar ratio of 10:1, respectively, and mix with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium. DNA·Lipofectamine complexes were added to in vitro day 10 cultures. After a 4-h incubation, the medium was replaced with original neuron culture medium. LRRK2-transfected neurons were subsequently fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde after 48-h transfection. TUNEL staining was performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescent images were collected on a Zeiss Automatic stage with Axiovision 6.0. Percent viability was calculated by normalizing the surviving green cells with total EGFP-positive cells in each culture. Most of the green transfected cells are LRRK2-transfected neurons as shown previously (23Xiong Y. Coombes C.E. Kilaru A. Li X. Gitler A.D. Bowers W.J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Moore D.J. PLoS Genet. 2006; 6: e1000902Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). LRRK2 contains three potential amino acids, Thr-2031, Ser-2032, and Thr-2035, within its activation loop that could be involved in autophosphorylation and regulation of LRRK2 (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, we made phospho-mimetic peptides (2025–2039) to Thr-2031, Ser-2032, and Thr-2035 and raised rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the three phosphopeptides (Fig. 1B). These antibodies were subjected to an affinity purification protocol, which first involved incubating the antisera with a nonphosphopeptide affinity column to remove nonphosphopeptide-specific antibodies followed by incubation with a phospho-specific peptide column. Both columns were eluted with 4 m MgCl2, and antibodies from the nonphosphopeptide column were designated anti-T2031, anti-S2032, and anti-T2035, and antibodies from the phosphopeptide column were designated anti-p-T2031, anti-p-S2032, and anti-p-T2035 (Fig. 1C). ELISA data using serial dilution of synthetic phospho- and nonphosphorylated peptide amino acids 2025–2039 which contain Thr-2031, Ser-2032, and Thr-2035 reveal that anti-p-T2031, anti-p-S2032, and anti-p-T2035 react strongly with their corresponding phosphorylated peptide, but not with the nonphosphorylated peptide (Fig. 2, A–C). To test the specificity of each phospho-antibody, a dot-blot analysis was performed where 1 ng of each peptide was blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by immunodetection with anti-p-T2031, anti-p-S2032, and anti-p-T2035, and anti-T2031, anti-S2032, and anti-T2035 (Fig. 2D). Each phospho-specific antibody specifically recognizes its corresponding amino acid with little or no overlap with other phosphopeptides (Fig. 2D). Antibody anti-p-T2031 and anti-p-S2032 show slight cross-reactivity to other phosphopeptides at higher concentration (10 ng of peptide) (data not shown). To determine whether these phosphoantibodies recognize full-length LRRK2, HEK293 cells were transfected with myc-tagged LRRK2 (Fig. 3). Anti-p-T2031 recognizes wild type LRRK2, and there is minimal reduction in immunoreactivity with the phospho-deficient T2031A mutant, whereas there is increased immunoreactivity against the phospho-mimetic mutants T2031D or T2031E (Fig. 3A). Anti-p-S2032 recognizes wild type LRRK2, and there is a modest reduction in immunoreactivity with the phospho-deficient S2032A mutant, whereas there is increased immunoreactivity against the phospho-mimetic mutants S2032D or S2032E (Fig. 3B). Anti-p-T2035 recognizes wild type LRRK2, and there is a marked reduction in immunoreactivity with the phospho-deficient T2035A mutant, whereas there is increased immunoreactivity against the phospho-mimetic mutants T2035D and T2035E (Fig. 3C). We evaluated the autophosphorylation activity of LRRK2 in the setting of mutations of the potential phosphorylation sites within the activation loop of LRRK2 (Fig. 4). Mutating all three potential phosphoamino acids to alanine (T2031A, S2032A, T2035A) reduces LRRK2 autophosphorylation by 60% (Fig. 4). As previously reported, the disease-causing mutation G2019S increases LRRK2 autophosphorylation by >30% (Fig. 4). Mutating Thr-2031 to the phospho-deficient T2031A mutant or the phospho-mimetic mutants T2031D and T2031E had no significant effect on LRRK2 autophosphoryation (Fig. 4, A and B). Mutating Ser-2032 to the phospho-deficient S2032A reduces LRRK2 autophosphorylation, whereas there are minimal effects on LRRK2 autophosphorylation with phospho-mimetic mutants S2032D or S2032E (Fig. 4, A and B). Mutating Thr-2035 to the phospho-deficient T2035A mutant or the phospho-mimetic mutant T2035D or T2035E reduces LRRK2 autophosphorylation to a level equivalent to the reduction in kinase activity in LRRK2 where the three potential phosphoamino acids are mutated to alanine (T2031A, S2032A, T2035A) (Fig. 4, A and B). Double mutants T2035A/T2031A and T2035A/S2032A showed a decrease of autophosphorylation similar to that of the T2035A single mutant, and T2031A/S2032A had a lower level of autophosphorylation, compared with the T2031A and S2032A single mutants (Fig. 4, C and D). H2O2 was shown to potentiate LRRK2 toxicity (16West A.B. Moore D.J. Choi C. Andrabi S.A. Li X. Dikeman D. Biskup S. Zhang Z. Lim K.L. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), thus we wondered whether H2O2 affected LRRK2 kinase activity. H2O2 activates LRRK2 kinase by ∼30% (Fig. 5, A and B) to a level equivalent to the disease-causing mutation G2019S (see Fig. 4). H2O2 fails to activate a kinase-dead version of LRRK2, which contains a D1944A mutation in the ATP binding pocket as well as the GTP binding-deficient mutant K1347A (Fig. 5, A and B). Autophosphorylation of the phospho-deficient T2031A, S2032A, and T2035A LRRRK2 mutants is not increased by H2O2 (Fig. 5, A and B). To determine whether the three putative autophosphorylation sites in LRRK2 are phosphorylated, LRRK2 phosphorylation was monitored in response to H2O2 with the phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 5, C–E). All three amino acids (Thr-2031, Ser-2032, and Thr-2035) are slightly phosphorylated in response to H2O2 (Fig. 5, C–E). LRRK2 autophosphorylation can be inhibited by staurosporine, a generic kinase inhibitor, at a low concentration (18Anand V.S. Reichling L.J. Lipinski K. Stochaj W. Duan W. Kelleher K. Pungaliya P.

Chem. 2009; 284: 36346-36356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of the three putative sites is phosphorylated in the autophosphorylation reaction, overexpressed wild type LRRK2 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to the standard LRRK2 kinase assay, with or without prior treatment of staurosporine (100 nm). The inhibition of LRRK2 phosphorylation can be monitored by all three specific phospho-LRRK2 antibodies (Fig. 6A), suggesting that all three sites are phosphorylated in LRRK2. Similarly, the increasing signal of LRRK2 phosphorylation also can be monitored by these three specific phospho-LRRK2 antibodies (Fig. 6B). Previous studies have shown that LRRK2 mutant G2019S enhanced its kinase activity by 2- or 3-fold (22Luzón-Toro B. Rubio de la Torre E. Delgado A. Pérez-Tur J. Hilfiker S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Jaleel M. Nichols R.J. Deak M. Campbell D.G. Gillardon F. Knebel A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The higher phosphorylation signals can be detected in our Western blots using any of these three LRRK2 phosphoantibodies (Fig. 6B), which further proved that all three sites are phosphorylated in LRRK2. H2O2 treatment did not enhance the phosphorylation level of G2019S mutant (Fig. 6B). Previously, we and others showed that LRRK2 toxicity is dependent on LRRK2 kinase activity (16West A.B. Moore D.J. Choi C. Andrabi S.A. Li X. Dikeman D. Biskup S. Zhang Z. Lim K.L. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 19Smith W.W. Pei Z. Jiang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1231-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). To determine whether mutations of the phosphorylation sites within the activation loop of LRRK2 influence LRRK2 toxicity, cell viability was monitored following overexpression of LRRK2 and the various LRRK2 phosphorylation mutants in mouse cortical neurons (Fig. 7). Toxicity was monitored using TUNEL method. Overexpression of wild type LRRK2 leads to ∼30% cell death, which is slightly less than the cell death induced by G2019S LRRK2 (Fig. 7). Mutating all three phosphoamino acids to alanine (T2031A, S2032A, T2035A) completely attenuates the cytoxicity. The phospho-deficient T2031A mutant or the phospho-mimetic mutants T2031D and T2031E had no effect on LRRK2 cytotoxicity compared with wild type LRRK2, similar to their lack of effect on LRRK2 autophosphorylation (Fig. 7). The phospho-deficient S2032A mutant or the phospho-mimetic mutants S2032D and S2032E also had no effect on LRRK2 cytotoxicity compared with wild type LRRK2, which is in contrast to the effect on LRRK2 autophosphorylation (Fig. 7). The phospho-deficient T2035A mutant or the phospho-mimetic mutants T2035D and T2035E slightly rescued LRRK2 cytotoxicity compared with wild type LRRK2, but still retained modest toxicity compared with control and TK-LRRK2 (Fig. 7). The toxicities of double phospho-deficient mutants were also measured to investigate further the relationship between the phosphorylation of LRRK2 and its pathology. Double mutants, which contain T2035A and either one of the other two deficient mutants (T2031A or S2032A), can rescue the toxicity of LRRK2 to a level similar to TK-LRRK2 (Fig. 7). Double mutant T2031A/S2032A also reduced the toxicity of LRRK2 but to a modest level. In the present study, we investigated LRRK2 autophosphorylation by raising phospho-specific antibodies to the three potential phosphorylation sites within the activation segment of LRRK2. All kinases contain an activation segment flanked by two conserved tripeptide motifs (DF/YG) and APE (26Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Within this activation segment it has been suggested that Thr-2031, Ser-2032, and Thr-2035 are potentially autophosphorylated by LRRK2. It is essential to identify potential phosphorylation sites in LRRK2 and ultimately to study the role of autophosphorylation in LRRK2 activity and pathogenesis. Accordingly, we raised polyclonal peptide antibodies recognizing phosphorylated Thr-2031, Ser-2032, and Thr-2035, respectively. ELISA, dot-blot, and immunoblot analysis demonstrate that anti-p-T2031, anti-p-S2032, and anti-p-T2035 are able to detect phosphorylated Thr-2031, Ser-2032, and Thr-2035, respectively. Most studies to date have investigated LRRK2 phosphorylation by either monitoring constitutive autophosphorylation or phosphorylation of pseudosubstrates (11West A.B. Moore D.J. Biskup S.

Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1231-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). No potential activators of LRRK2 kinase have been reported. Previously, we showed that LRRK2 toxicity is enhanced by H2O2, and here we show that H2O2 increases LRRK2 autophosphorylation to a level equivalent to the enhanced phosphorylation observed with the G2019S mutant (16West A.B. Moore D.J. Choi C. Andrabi S.A. Li X. Dikeman D. Biskup S. Zhang Z. Lim K.L. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Thus, H2O2 treatment provides an opportunity to investigate the consequences of perturbation of the phosphorylation state within the activation loop of LRRK2 in response to LRRK2 activation. A number of protein kinases contain a conserved Thr-2035 within their activation segment, where it is thought to serve as an activator of kinase activity. Mutations of Thr-2035 to T2035A abolish LRRK2 autophosphorylation, as previously described, and H2O2 fails to activate LRRK2 (22Luzón-Toro B. Rubio de la Torre E. Delgado A. Pérez-Tur J. Hilfiker S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A double mutant containing T2035A together with T2031A or S2032A showed similar reduction of LRRK2 autophosphorylation. Substitutions with negatively charged amino acids to act as pseudo-phospho-mimetics T2035D and T2035E also abolished LRRK2 autophosphorylation and activation by H2O2. The anti-p-T2035 antibody shows that Thr-2035 is indeed phosphorylated in LRRK2 protein. Western blotting using this antibody showed decreasing phosphorylation signals of wild type LRRK2 when treated with staurosporine and increasing phosphorylation signals of LRRK2-G2019S mutant compared with its wild type partner, thus suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue is critical for LRRK2 kinase activity, although we cannot exclude the possibility that this residue provides important structural confirmation to LRRK2, as observed previously (22Luzón-Toro B. Rubio de la Torre E. Delgado A. Pérez-Tur J. Hilfiker S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Substitution of Ser-2032 with S2032A partially reduced constitutive and H2O2 stimulated LRRK2 autophosphorylation. Substitutions with negatively charged amino acids to act as pseudo-phospho-mimetics S2032D or S2032E had no effect on constitutive LRRK2 autophosphorylation, suggesting that this site is also autophosphorylated by LRRK2. Consistent with this notion, anti-p-S2032 antibody indicates that Ser-2032 is autophosphorylated in LRRK2, with higher signals when activated by H2O2 or mutant G2019S, and lower signals when inhibited by staurosporine. Although mutations of Thr-2031 to T2031A, T2031D, or T2031E had no effect on LRRK2 autophosphorylation, anti-p-T2031 indicates that this site is also autophosphorylated in LRRK2. Thus, all three amino acids within the activation loop of LRRK2 are autophosphorylated, with Thr-2035 and Ser-2032 playing a role in the activation state of LRRK2. LRRK2 toxicity requires kinase activity, and we investigated the role of the phosphorylated amino acids within the activation loop on LRRK2 toxicity in cortical neurons (16West A.B. Moore D.J. Choi C. Andrabi S.A. Li X. Dikeman D. Biskup S. Zhang Z. Lim K.L. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). As previously reported, wild type LRRK2 is toxic. Substitution of all three amino acids with alanine (TK-LRRK2) completely attenuates wild type LRRK2 toxicity. The most parsimonious explanation for the reduction in LRRK2 toxicity by TK-LRRK2 is a reduction in kinase activity. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that TK-LRRK2 has functional consequences on the structural confirmation of LRRK2 that impair its kinase activity. Surprisingly, substitution of Thr-2035 to T2035A only partially rescued toxicity, which contrasts with the dramatic effects on autophosphorylation. Substitution of Thr-2031 and Ser-2032 with alanine had essentially no effect on wild type LRRK2 toxicity. Substitutions with negatively charged amino acids to act as pseudo-phospho-mimetics for Thr-2031, Ser-2032, and Thr-2035 also had no effect. Double mutants T2031A/T2035A and S2032A/T2035A can rescue LRRK2-induced toxicity, similar to TK-LRRK2, whereas T2031A/S2032A still retains modest cytotoxicity compared with the pcDNA control. These data suggest that LRRK2 toxicity is not completely dependent on the phosphorylation state of LRRK2 and that phosphorylation of the individual amino acids in the activation loop has as yet unexplained functions and roles in LRRK2 toxicity. In conclusion, this study reports the development of LRRK2 phosphopeptide antibodies to the phosphopeptides within the activation loop of LRRK2 and shows for the first time that all three amino acids are autophosphorylated. These antibodies can be used to explore LRRK2 activity and the role of autophosphorylation in the pathogenesis of PD. leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 C terminus of HSP70-interacting proteins enhanced green fluorescent protein Parkinson disease triple kinase mutant of LRRK2 (T2031A, S2032A and T2035A)."
https://openalex.org/W2170892691,"Background Platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) is a tyrosine kinase receptor known to affect vascular development. The zebrafish is an excellent model to study specific regulators of vascular development, yet the role of PDGF signaling has not been determined in early zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, vascular mural cells, in which PDGFRβ functions cell autonomously in other systems, have not been identified in zebrafish embryos younger than 72 hours post fertilization. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to investigate the role of PDGFRβ in zebrafish vascular development, we cloned the highly conserved zebrafish homolog of PDGFRβ. We found that pdgfrβ is expressed in the hypochord, a developmental structure that is immediately dorsal to the dorsal aorta and potentially regulates blood vessel development in the zebrafish. Using a PDGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, a morpholino oligonucleotide specific to PDGFRβ, and a dominant negative PDGFRβ transgenic line, we found that PDGFRβ is necessary for angiogenesis of the intersegmental vessels. Significance/Conclusion Our data provide the first evidence that PDGFRβ signaling is required for zebrafish angiogenesis. We propose a novel mechanism for zebrafish PDGFRβ signaling that regulates vascular angiogenesis in the absence of mural cells."
https://openalex.org/W2047435839,"The maturation and activation of the anti-oxidant Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are highly regulated processes that require several post-translational modifications. The maturation of SOD1 is initiated by incorporation of zinc and copper ions followed by disulfide oxidation leading to the formation of enzymatically active homodimers. Our present data indicate that homodimer formation is a regulated final step in SOD1 maturation and implicate the recently characterized copper homeostasis protein COMMD1 in this process. COMMD1 interacts with SOD1, and this interaction requires CCS-mediated copper incorporation into SOD1. COMMD1 does not regulate disulfide oxidation of SOD1 but reduces the level of SOD1 homodimers. RNAi-mediated knockdown of COMMD1 expression results in a significant induction of SOD1 activity and a consequent decrease in superoxide anion concentrations, whereas overexpression of COMMD1 exerts exactly the opposite effects. Here, we identify COMMD1 as a novel protein regulating SOD1 activation and associate COMMD1 function with the production of free radicals."

Because of the critical role that STAT3 plays in mediating oncogenesis, the stimulatory effects of NEK6 on STAT3 and cell transformation suggest that this family of serine/threonine kinases might represent a novel chemotherapeutic target. IntroductionNEK6 (NIMA-related kinase 6) is a serine/threonine kinase identified as a homologue of the Aspergillus nidulans protein NIMA (never in mitosis, gene A). Aspergillus NIMA is essential for the initiation of mitosis, and its degradation is necessary for mitotic exit (1Osmani S.A. May G.S. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1495-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 2Pu R.T. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The NEK6 protein level is also increased during mitosis, concomitant with an increase in NEK6 activity (3Belham C. Roig J. Caldwell J.A. Aoyama Y. Kemp B.E. Comb M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34897-34909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Overexpression of catalytically inactive NEK6 causes arrest of cells in mitosis and interferes with chromosome segregation (4Yin M.J. Shao L. Voehringer D. Smeal T. Jallal B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52454-52460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, depletion of the endogenous NEK6 protein using siRNA in HeLa cells resulted in mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis (4Yin M.J. Shao L. Voehringer D. Smeal T. Jallal B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52454-52460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, NEK6 activity appears to be required for proper anaphase progression with cells either arresting at the spindle checkpoint and undergoing apoptosis or completing mitosis but with the acquisition of nuclear abnormalities in the process. Inhibition of NEK6 has been suggested to be involved in G2/M phase cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damage (5Lee M.Y. Kim H.J. Kim M.A. Jee H.J. Kim A.J. Bae Y.S. Park J.I. Chung J.H. Yun J. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 2705-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Despite the critical role of NEK6 in maintaining proper progression of the cell cycle, the physiological substrates of NEK6 are largely undefined. NEK6 was initially identified in a screen to determine upstream kinases of the 70 ribosomal S6 kinase (6Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, additional evidence did not support S6 kinase as a physiological substrate of NEK6 (7Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Morrice N. Kieloch A. Hastie C.J. Dong L. Schutkowski M. Reimer U. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). NEK6 was suggested to phosphorylate the kinesin Eg5 at a novel site necessary for mitotic spindle formation (8Rapley J. Nicolàs M. Groen A. Regué L. Bertran M.T. Caelles C. Avruch J. Roig J. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3912-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).A possible role for NEK6 in tumorigenesis has been indicated. Analysis of hepatic cancer carcinomas showed that nek6 mRNA expression was up-regulated in 70% of all cancers examined and correlated well with the up-regulation of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase or Pin1 (9Chen J. Li L. Zhang Y. Yang H. Wei Y. Zhang L. Liu X. Yu L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because Pin1 plays an important role in the regulation of cell cycle and is prevalently overexpressed in human cancers, it is regarded as a new potential therapeutic target. Furthermore, evidence indicates that the growth rate of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells is reduced by the overexpression of catalytically inactive NEK6 (4Yin M.J. Shao L. Voehringer D. Smeal T. Jallal B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52454-52460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the biological functions and mechanisms of NEK6 activity in carcinogenesis are largely unknown. Thus, the identification of key substrates is probably the most important component in discovering the function of NEK6 in carcinogenesis.In the present study, we demonstrate that NEK6 is overexpressed in various human cancer tissues, and ectopic expression of NEK6 increases tumor promoter-induced transformation of JB6 Cl41 mouse epidermal cells. We also discovered that STAT3, a member of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family, is a novel target of NEK6. STAT3, which was originally discovered as a mediator in the cytokine signaling pathway, plays an important role in carcinogenesis, including anchorage-independent transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells (10Yu C.Y. Wang L. Khaletskiy A. Farrar W.L. Larner A. Colburn N.H. Li J.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3949-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results provide strong evidence linking NEK6 to carcinogenesis.DISCUSSIONWe demonstrated that ectopic expression of NEK6 increases tumor promoter-induced cell transformation and STAT3 phosphorylation at Ser727. The major finding of the present study is that NEK6 plays an important role in oncogenesis. Using the JB6 Cl41 cell transformation model, we showed that ectopic expression of NEK6 significantly increases the anchorage-independent growth induced by EGF or TPA. The expression of kinase-inactive NEK6 further confirmed the important role of NEK6 in tumor promoter-induced cell transformation. The function of NEK6 in cancer cell growth was suggested by a previous report indicating that the growth rate of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells was reduced by the overexpression of catalytically inactive NEK6 (4Yin M.J. Shao L. Voehringer D. Smeal T. Jallal B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52454-52460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our data also confirmed that NEK6 wild type or mutant K74M/K75M expression in JB6 Cl41 cells increased or decreased cell proliferation, respectively (Fig. 2B). Moreover, immunofluorescence staining of 47 pairs of normal and cancer tissues showed that the NEK6 protein was highly abundant in cancer tissues compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1). Chen et al. (9Chen J. Li L. Zhang Y. Yang H. Wei Y. Zhang L. Liu X. Yu L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that NEK6 mRNA expression was up-regulated in 70% of hepatic carcinomas. These results highlight the potential of NEK6 as a novel target of chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive agents.We also showed that STAT3, an oncogenic transcription factor, is a novel target of NEK6 and an important mediator of oncogenesis by NEK6. Several lines of experimental evidence support this contention. First, when we tested the interaction between NEK6 and several transcription factors that are important in tumorigenesis or tumor suppression, we found that STAT3 is a strong binding partner of NEK6. Second, we showed that NEK6 phosphorylated STAT3 in a dose-dependent manner. Third, knockdown of NEK6 decreased STAT3 phosphorylation. Finally, based on the mutant NEK6 study, NEK6-mediated STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation corresponds well with JB6 Cl41 cell transformation.STAT3 is a member of the STAT family of cytoplasmic transcription factors, which play critical roles in cytokine and growth factor signaling. Activated STAT3 induces transformation of NIH-3T3 cells and produces tumors in nude mice (13Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar, 26Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of STAT3 is detected in many human malignancies, including prostate, lung, brain, breast, and squamous cell carcinomas. Persistent STAT3 activation promotes uncontrolled growth and survival through deregulation of gene expression, including cyclin D1, c-myc, bcl-xL, mcl-1, and survivin genes, and thereby contributes to oncogenesis. Because of the critical role of STAT3 in oncogenesis, the stimulatory effects of NEK6 on anchorage-independent transformation of JB6 Cl41 mouse skin cells most likely involve the activation of STAT3. This was further confirmed by a report showing that STAT3 plays an important role in carcinogenesis, including anchorage-independent transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells (10Yu C.Y. Wang L. Khaletskiy A. Farrar W.L. Larner A. Colburn N.H. Li J.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3949-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).One of the major findings of the present study is that the phosphorylation on both Ser206 and Thr210 of NEK6 is critical for STAT3 phosphorylation and anchorage-independent transformation of mouse epidermal cells. The importance of Ser206 was previously described in that Nercc/NEK9 catalyzes the direct phosphorylation of prokaryotic recombinant NEK6 at Ser206 in vitro, concomitant with a 20–25-fold activation of NEK6 activity toward S6 kinase phosphorylation (3Belham C.

However, kinases that can phosphorylate Thr210 have not been identified. Because the T210A mutant significantly decreased NEK6 activity, the identification of the upstream kinase is very important for the mechanistic study of NEK6 regulation. Interestingly, Thr210 is followed by a proline residue that can be recognized by Pin1. The interaction between NEK6 and Pin1 has been reported (9Chen J. Li L. Zhang Y. Yang H. Wei Y. Zhang L. Liu X. Yu L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pin1 specifically recognizes a proline preceded by a phosphorylated serine or threonine residue (phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro motif) and catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of the target peptidyl-prolyl bonds (14Wulf G. Finn G. Suizu F. Lu K.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The importance of Ser206 and Thr210 for NEK6 activity was further explained by the homology model of NEK6. Ser206 and Thr210 seemed to be located at crucial sites for interacting with phosphoamino acid-binding proteins. These substrate recruitment sites are normally shaped by the conformation adopted by the activation loop upon phosphorylation. In contrast, Thr202 is on the edge of the pocket and thus does not seem to be part of the substrate binding surface. Therefore, the phosphorylation of Ser206 and Thr210 might possibly play an important role in the binding of substrates.In summary, these experiments demonstrate that ectopic expression of NEK6 induces anchorage-independent transformation of JB6 Cl41 mouse epidermal cells. Based on our findings, the most likely mechanism that can account for this biological effect involves, at least in part, the activation of STAT3 through its phosphorylation on Ser727. Because of the critical role that STAT3 plays in mediating oncogenesis, the stimulatory effects of NEK6 on STAT3 and cell transformation suggest that this family of serine/threonine kinases may represent a novel chemotherapeutic target. IntroductionNEK6 (NIMA-related kinase 6) is a serine/threonine kinase identified as a homologue of the Aspergillus nidulans protein NIMA (never in mitosis, gene A). Aspergillus NIMA is essential for the initiation of mitosis, and its degradation is necessary for mitotic exit (1Osmani S.A. May G.S. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1495-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 2Pu R.T. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The NEK6 protein level is also increased during mitosis, concomitant with an increase in NEK6 activity (3Belham C. Roig J. Caldwell J.A. Aoyama Y. Kemp B.E. Comb M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34897-34909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Overexpression of catalytically inactive NEK6 causes arrest of cells in mitosis and interferes with chromosome segregation (4Yin M.J. Shao L. Voehringer D. Smeal T. Jallal B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52454-52460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, depletion of the endogenous NEK6 protein using siRNA in HeLa cells resulted in mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis (4Yin M.J. Shao L. Voehringer D. Smeal T. Jallal B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52454-52460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, NEK6 activity appears to be required for proper anaphase progression with cells either arresting at the spindle checkpoint and undergoing apoptosis or completing mitosis but with the acquisition of nuclear abnormalities in the process. Inhibition of NEK6 has been suggested to be involved in G2/M phase cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damage (5Lee M.Y. Kim H.J. Kim M.A. Jee H.J. Kim A.J. Bae Y.S. Park J.I. Chung J.H. Yun J. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 2705-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Despite the critical role of NEK6 in maintaining proper progression of the cell cycle, the physiological substrates of NEK6 are largely undefined. NEK6 was initially identified in a screen to determine upstream kinases of the 70 ribosomal S6 kinase (6Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, additional evidence did not support S6 kinase as a physiological substrate of NEK6 (7Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Morrice N. Kieloch A. Hastie C.J. Dong L. Schutkowski M. Reimer U. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). NEK6 was suggested to phosphorylate the kinesin Eg5 at a novel site necessary for mitotic spindle formation (8Rapley J. Nicolàs M. Groen A. Regué L. Bertran M.T. Caelles C. Avruch J. Roig J. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3912-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).A possible role for NEK6 in tumorigenesis has been indicated. Analysis of hepatic cancer carcinomas showed that nek6 mRNA expression was up-regulated in 70% of all cancers examined and correlated well with the up-regulation of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase or Pin1 (9Chen J. Li L. Zhang Y. Yang H. Wei Y. Zhang L. Liu X. Yu L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because Pin1 plays an important role in the regulation of cell cycle and is prevalently overexpressed in human cancers, it is regarded as a new potential therapeutic target. Furthermore, evidence indicates that the growth rate of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells is reduced by the overexpression of catalytically inactive NEK6 (4Yin M.J. Shao L. Voehringer D. Smeal T. Jallal B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52454-52460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the biological functions and mechanisms of NEK6 activity in carcinogenesis are largely unknown. Thus, the identification of key substrates is probably the most important component in discovering the function of NEK6 in carcinogenesis.In the present study, we demonstrate that NEK6 is overexpressed in various human cancer tissues, and ectopic expression of NEK6 increases tumor promoter-induced transformation of JB6 Cl41 mouse epidermal cells. We also discovered that STAT3, a member of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family, is a novel target of NEK6. STAT3, which was originally discovered as a mediator in the cytokine signaling pathway, plays an important role in carcinogenesis, including anchorage-independent transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells (10Yu C.Y. Wang L. Khaletskiy A. Farrar W.L. Larner A. Colburn N.H. Li J.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3949-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results provide strong evidence linking NEK6 to carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1985424465,"Wild aquatic birds in the Orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are the main reservoir hosts perpetuating the genetic pool of all influenza A viruses, including pandemic viruses. High viral loads in feces of infected birds permit a fecal-oral route of transmission. Numerous studies have reported the isolation of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) from surface water at aquatic bird habitats. These isolations indicate aquatic environments have an important role in the transmission of AIV among wild aquatic birds. However, the progressive dilution of infectious feces in water could decrease the likelihood of virus/host interactions. To evaluate whether alternate mechanisms facilitate AIV transmission in aquatic bird populations, we investigated whether the preen oil gland secretions by which all aquatic birds make their feathers waterproof could support a natural mechanism that concentrates AIVs from water onto birds' bodies, thus, representing a possible source of infection by preening activity. We consistently detected both viral RNA and infectious AIVs on swabs of preened feathers of 345 wild mallards by using reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus-isolation (VI) assays. Additionally, in two laboratory experiments using a quantitative real-time (qR) RT-PCR assay, we demonstrated that feather samples (n = 5) and cotton swabs (n = 24) experimentally impregnated with preen oil, when soaked in AIV-contaminated waters, attracted and concentrated AIVs on their surfaces. The data presented herein provide information that expands our understanding of AIV ecology in the wild bird reservoir system."

Dysferlin mutations cause inherited muscular dystrophy, and dysferlin also shows abnormal plasma membrane expression in other forms of muscular dystrophy. We establish dysferlin as a short-lived (protein half-life ∼4–6 h) and transitory transmembrane protein (plasma membrane half-life ∼3 h), with a propensity for rapid endocytosis when mutated, and an association with a syntaxin-4 endocytic route. Dysferlin plasma membrane expression and endocytic rate is regulated by the C2B-FerI-C2C motif, with a critical role identified for C2C. Disruption of C2C dramatically reduces plasma membrane dysferlin (by 2.5-fold), due largely to accelerated endocytosis (by 2.5-fold). These properties of reduced efficiency of plasma membrane expression due to accelerated endocytosis are also a feature of patient missense mutant L344P (within FerI, adjacent to C2C). Importantly, dysferlin mutants that demonstrate accelerated endocytosis also display increased protein lability via endosomal proteolysis, implicating endosomal-mediated proteolytic degradation as a novel basis for dysferlin-deficiency in patients with single missense mutations. Vesicular labeling studies establish that dysferlin mutants rapidly transit from EEA1-positive early endosomes through to dextran-positive lysosomes, co-labeled by syntaxin-4 at multiple stages of endosomal transit. In summary, our studies define a transient biology for dysferlin, relevant to emerging patient therapeutics targeting dysferlin replacement. We introduce accelerated endosomal-directed degradation as a basis for lability of dysferlin missense mutants in dysferlinopathy, and show that dysferlin and syntaxin-4 similarly transit a common endosomal pathway in skeletal muscle cells.

https://openalex.org/W2026676833,"Trigger factor (TF) is the first molecular chaperone that interacts with nascent chains emerging from bacterial ribosomes. TF is a modular protein, consisting of an N-terminal ribosome binding domain, a PPIase domain, and a C-terminal domain, all of which participate in polypeptide binding. To directly monitor the interactions of TF with nascent polypeptide chains, TF variants were site-specifically labeled with an environmentally sensitive NBD fluorophore. We found a marked increase in TF-NBD fluorescence during translation of firefly luciferase (Luc) chains, which expose substantial regions of hydrophobicity, but not with nascent chains lacking extensive hydrophobic segments. TF remained associated with Luc nascent chains for 111 +/- 7 s, much longer than it remained bound to the ribosomes (t((1/2)) approximately 10-14 s). Thus, multiple TF molecules can bind per nascent chain during translation. The Escherichia coli cytosolic proteome was classified into predicted weak and strong interactors for TF, based on the occurrence of continuous hydrophobic segments in the primary sequence. The residence time of TF on the nascent chain generally correlated with the presence of hydrophobic regions and the capacity of nascent chains to bury hydrophobicity. Interestingly, TF bound the signal sequence of a secretory protein, pOmpA, but not the hydrophobic signal anchor sequence of the inner membrane protein FtsQ. On the other hand, proteins lacking linear hydrophobic segments also recruited TF, suggesting that TF can recognize hydrophobic surface features discontinuous in sequence. Moreover, TF retained significant affinity for the folded domain of the positively charged, ribosomal protein S7, indicative of an alternative mode of TF action. Thus, unlike other chaperones, TF appears to employ multiple mechanisms to interact with a wide range of substrate proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2153652414,"Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in syndromes associated with mental impairment but little is known about the role of epigenetics in determining the normal variation in human intelligence. We measured polymorphisms in four DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT3L) involved in epigenetic marking and related these to childhood and adult general intelligence in a population (n = 1542) consisting of two Scottish cohorts born in 1936 and residing in Lothian (n = 1075) or Aberdeen (n = 467). All subjects had taken the same test of intelligence at age 11yrs. The Lothian cohort took the test again at age 70yrs. The minor T allele of DNMT3L SNP 11330C>T (rs7354779) allele was associated with a higher standardised childhood intelligence score; greatest effect in the dominant analysis but also significant in the additive model (coefficient = 1.40(additive); 95%CI 0.22,2.59; p = 0.020 and 1.99(dominant); 95%CI 0.55,3.43; p = 0.007). The DNMT3L C allele was associated with an increased risk of being below average intelligence (OR 1.25(additive); 95%CI 1.05,1.51; p = 0.011 and OR 1.37(dominant); 95%CI 1.11,1.68; p = 0.003), and being in the lowest 40(th) (p(additive) = 0.009; p(dominant) = 0.002) and lowest 30(th) (p(additive) = 0.004; p(dominant) = 0.002) centiles for intelligence. After Bonferroni correction for the number variants tested the link between DNMT3L 11330C>T and childhood intelligence remained significant by linear regression and centile analysis; only the additive regression model was borderline significant. Adult intelligence was similarly linked to the DNMT3L variant but this analysis was limited by the numbers studied and nature of the test and the association was not significant after Bonferroni correction. We believe that the role of epigenetics in the normal variation in human intelligence merits further study and that this novel finding should be tested in other cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2031080954,"Plant-ants live in a mutualistic association with host plants known as “myrmecophytes” that provide them with a nesting place and sometimes with extra-floral nectar (EFN) and/or food bodies (FBs); the ants can also attend sap-sucking Hemiptera for their honeydew. In return, plant-ants, like most other arboreal ants, protect their host plants from defoliators. To satisfy their nitrogen requirements, however, some have optimized their ability to capture prey in the restricted environment represented by the crowns of trees by using elaborate hunting techniques. In this study, we investigated the predatory behavior of the ant Azteca andreae which is associated with the myrmecophyte Cecropia obtusa. We noted that up to 8350 ant workers per tree hide side-by-side beneath the leaf margins of their host plant with their mandibles open, waiting for insects to alight. The latter are immediately seized by their extremities, and then spread-eagled; nestmates are recruited to help stretch, carve up and transport prey. This group ambush hunting technique is particularly effective when the underside of the leaves is downy, as is the case for C. obtusa. In this case, the hook-shaped claws of the A. andreae workers and the velvet-like structure of the underside of the leaves combine to act like natural Velcro® that is reinforced by the group ambush strategy of the workers, allowing them to capture prey of up to 13,350 times the mean weight of a single worker."
https://openalex.org/W2043724939,"Sepsis results in the formation of pulmonary edema by increasing in epithelial permeability. Therefore we hypothesized that alveolar epithelial cells isolated from septic animals develop tight junctions with different protein composition and reduced barrier function relative to alveolar epithelial cells from healthy animals. Male rats (200–300g) were sacrificed 24 hours after cecal ligation and double puncture (2CLP) or sham surgery. Alveolar epithelial cells were isolated and plated on fibronectin-coated flexible membranes or permeable, non-flexible transwell substrates. After a 5 day culture period, cells were either lysed for western analysis of tight junction protein expressin (claudin 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 18, occludin, ZO-1, and JAM-A) and MAPk (JNK, ERK, an p38) signaling activation, or barrier function was examined by measuring transepithelial resistance (TER) or the flux of two molecular tracers (5 and 20 Å). Inhibitors of JNK (SP600125, 20 µM) and ERK (U0126, 10 µM) were used to determine the role of these pathways in sepsis induced epithelial barrier dysfunction. Expression of claudin 4, claudin 18, and occludin was significantly lower, and activation of JNK and ERK signaling pathways was significantly increased in 2CLP monolayers, relative to sham monolayers. Transepithelial resistance of the 2CLP monolayers was reduced significantly compared to sham (769 and 1234 ohm-cm2, respectively), however no significant difference in the flux of either tracer was observed. Inhibition of ERK, not JNK, significantly increased TER and expression of claudin 4 in 2CLP monolayers, and prevented significant differences in claudin 18 expression between 2CLP and sham monolayers. We conclude that alveolar epithelial cells isolated from septic animals form confluent monolayers with impaired barrier function compared to healthy monolayers, and inhibition of ERK signaling partially reverses differences between these monolayers. This model provides a unique preparation for probing the mechanisms by which sepsis alters alveolar epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2104715392,"Background Tuberculin is still the only available skin test reagent for the diagnosis of mycobacterial infection. The product has a remarkable sensitivity, but poor specificity. Previous studies, including two human phase I clinical trials, have indicated that rdESAT-6 has a potential as an improved skin test reagent. Animal studies have shown that the sensitivity may be increased by inclusion of the genetically related CFP-10 antigen in the preparation without loosing specificity. Methodology In this study a Lactococcus fermented, recombinant skin test reagent consisting of a 1∶1 wt/wt of rdESAT-6 and CFP-10 was manufactured according to GMP standards and tested for the first time in 42 healthy adult volunteers. The two doses of 0.01 µg or 0.1 µg were injected intradermally by the Mantoux technique with 6 or 12 weeks interval. No serious adverse events and only mild adverse reactions were reported. The reagent elicited a positive skin test reaction after the first injection in one participant, who most likely was latently infected with M. tuberculosis as indicated by an appreciable IFN γ response just below the Quantiferon® cut-off level at the screening visit. None of the remaining participants in the four groups had any skin test reactions and sensitisation by the reagent could therefore be excluded. Conclusion The investigational skin test reagent rdESAT-6 and CFP-10 appeared safe and non-sensitising in this first-in-man clinical trial in human volunteers and can now be tested in larger clinical trials involving individuals with latent M. tuberculosis infection or active TB disease.

https://openalex.org/W2076296842,"Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are essential enzymes that carry out the de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides by reducing ribonucleotides. There are three different classes of RNRs (I, II and III), all having different oxygen dependency and biochemical characteristics. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) harbors class Ia, class Ib and class III RNRs in its genome. We have studied the transcriptional regulation of these three RNR classes in S. Typhimurium as well as their differential function during infection of macrophage and epithelial cells. Deletion of both NrdR and Fur, two main transcriptional regulators, indicates that Fur specifically represses the class Ib enzyme and that NrdR acts as a global repressor of all three classes. A Fur recognition sequence within the nrdHIEF promoter has also been described and confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). In order to elucidate the role of each RNR class during infection, S. Typhimurium single and double RNR mutants (as well as Fur and NrdR mutants) were used in infection assays with macrophage and epithelial cell lines. Our results indicate class Ia to be mainly responsible for deoxyribonucleotide production during invasion and proliferation inside macrophages and epithelial cells. Neither class Ib nor class III seem to be essential for growth under these conditions. However, class Ib is able to maintain certain growth in an nrdAB mutant during the first hours of macrophage infection. Our results suggest that, during the early stages of macrophage infection, class Ib may contribute to deoxyribonucleotide synthesis by means of both an NrdR and a Fur-dependent derepression of nrdHIEF due to hydrogen peroxide production and DNA damage associated with the oxidative burst, thus helping to overcome the host defenses."
https://openalex.org/W2132177392,"The Hawaiian Islands are an ideal location to study the response of tropical forests to climate variability because of their extreme isolation in the middle of the Pacific, which makes them especially sensitive to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Most research examining the response of tropical forests to drought or El Niño have focused on rainforests, however, tropical dry forests cover a large area of the tropics and may respond very differently than rainforests. We use satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from February 2000-February 2009 to show that rainforests and dry forests in the Hawaiian Islands exhibit asynchronous responses in leaf phenology to seasonal and El Niño-driven drought. Dry forest NDVI was more tightly coupled with precipitation compared to rainforest NDVI. Rainforest cloud frequency was negatively correlated with the degree of asynchronicity (ΔNDVI) between forest types, most strongly at a 1-month lag. Rainforest green-up and dry forest brown-down was particularly apparent during the 2002–003 El Niño. The spatial pattern of NDVI response to the NINO 3.4 Sea Surface Temperature (SST) index during 2002–2003 showed that the leeward side exhibited significant negative correlations to increased SSTs, whereas the windward side exhibited significant positive correlations to increased SSTs, most evident at an 8 to 9-month lag. This study demonstrates that different tropical forest types exhibit asynchronous responses to seasonal and El Niño-driven drought, and suggests that mechanisms controlling dry forest leaf phenology are related to water-limitation, whereas rainforests are more light-limited."

Rouault J. Magaud J. Berthet C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 14Albrecht M. Lengauer T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and are known to bind to the PABC domain of cytosolic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1). PAM2-N was previously identified as the PABP-binding site (15Okochi K. Suzuki T. Inoue J. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We recently reported that the mutation of Phe-274 of PAM2-C to alanine completely abolishes the binding affinity of Tob for PABPC1. This suggests that the interaction of PAM2-C and PABC is crucial for Tob-PABPC1 interaction (16Funakoshi Y. Doi Y. Hosoda N. Uchida N. Osawa M. Shimada I. Tsujimoto M. Suzuki T. Katada T. Hoshino S. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The translation termination-coupled mRNA decay rate was significantly slowed by mutations in the PAM2 region of eRF3, the PAM2 region of Tob, or the PAM2-binding site of PABC. Thus, we proposed that the coupling occurs with competition between eRF3 and Tob for PABC, which recruits Ccr4-Caf1 to the 3′-poly(A) tail (16Funakoshi Y. Doi Y. Hosoda N. Uchida N. Osawa M. Shimada I. Tsujimoto M. Suzuki T. Katada T. Hoshino S. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of the competition remains elusive and should be quantitatively clarified on the basis of the binding affinities and intracellular levels of these proteins. PABPC1-interacting motif 2 N-terminal PAM2 C-terminal PAM2 cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein 1 C-terminal domain of PABPC1 isothermal titration calorimetry heteronuclear single quantum coherence chemical shift perturbation. Here, we investigated the physicochemical properties of the interaction of Tob with Caf1 and PABPC1 using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The analyses revealed that Tob consists of a folded N-terminal BTG-Tob domain and an unstructured C-terminal region that contains two PAM2 motifs. The affinities of Tob for Caf1 and PABC were assessed using several Tob fragments. The results indicated that the C-terminal PAM2 sequence is the primary PABC-binding site and that Tob binds independently to Caf1 and PABC. The Caf1-Tob-PABPC1 ternary complex can thus be formed. Furthermore, we investigated the intracellular levels of eRF3, PABPC1, and Tob, all of which are involved in translation termination-coupled mRNA decay. The affinities and cellular levels of these proteins revealed the mechanism by which the deadenylase activity of Ccr4-Caf1 is regulated by eRF3 in a translation termination-coupled manner. The cDNAs encoding full-length human Caf1, Tob (full-length, residues 1–285, 1–148, 147–285, 121–148, and 260–285), and the PABC domain of PABPC1 (residues 541–623) were amplified by PCR using pCMVfrag-hCAF1, hTob, and PABPC1 constructs (16Funakoshi Y.

The constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) codon plus-RP, cultured in LB media, or in M9 medium containing [13C]glucose and/or 15[N]NH4Cl for uniformly 13C/15N- or 15N-labeled samples for NMR in minimal media. Recombinant GST-fused proteins were purified using a glutathione-SepharoseTM 4B affinity column. The GST tag was removed by PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). The TobN285, 3Throughout this report, the format TobNxxx indicates a Tob fragment containing residues 1–xxx. The format Tob(xxx–yyy) indicates a Tob fragment containing residues xxx–yyy. TobN148, and Tob(147–285) proteins were further purified by gel filtration chromatography, and the PABC, Tob(121–148), and Tob(260–285) proteins were purified by reversed-phase chromatography. For the backbone assignments of TobN148, uniformly 13C/15N-lableled TobN148 were prepared at a concentration of 0.3 mm in a buffer containing 10 mm phosphate (pH 6.0), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 m choline-O-sulfate, and 8% (v/v) D2O. A set of the triple resonance experiments, HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH, in conjunction with 15N-edited NOESY heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) with a mixing time of 120 ms, was performed at 35 °C on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe, and the spectra were processed by using Sparky software (26Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar). The backbone assignments of Tob(260–285) were established by analyzing homonuclear NOESY and total correlation spectroscopy, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 15N-edited total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC, which were transferred to the signals in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of [15N]Tob(147–285). The PABC titrations (0–1.6 mm) were carried out for [15N]Tob(260–285) and [15N]Tob(147–285) with Tob fragment concentrations of 0.4 mm at 30 °C. The previously reported backbone assignments of PABC were confirmed by HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH. The titrations of Tob(147–285) at 0–0.2 mm were carried out for [15N]PABC at 0.1–0.2 mm, 30 °C. The binding of TobN285 and TobN148 to Caf1 was measured by ITC (17Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar) using a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). The protein samples were dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (pH 6.0). A total of 290 μl of 79 μm TobN285 and 161 μm TobN148 was injected into the 7.6 and 12 μm Caf1 solutions, respectively, at 25 °C. To analyze the interactions between Tob fragments and PABC, aliquots of 408–550 μm PABC solutions were injected into solutions of 29–39 μm Tob fragments using the ITC buffer containing 10 mm NaH2PO4 and 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.0). In addition, the ITC experiments were carried out in salt-free buffer for the binding of TobN148, Tob(121–147), Tob(147–285), and Tob(260–285) to PABC. Heats of dilution were determined by titrating the injectant solution into the dialysis buffer, after which the heats were subtracted from the raw titration data before data analysis. The titration data were analyzed using the MicroCal Origin software version 5.0, provided by the manufacturer.

However, the rest of the protein, which is less conserved among the BTG family proteins, provides distinguishing characteristics among the family members. We attempted to investigate the structure of full-length Tob (345 residues) and its interactions with Caf1 and PABC. Unfortunately, only a trace amount of the full-length Tob was expressed in E. coli, and therefore, we used a C-terminally truncated mutant (residues 1–285, hereafter referred to as TobN285), which was previously shown to form a ternary complex with Caf1 and PABPC1 (16Funakoshi Y. Doi Y. Hosoda N. Uchida N. Osawa M. Shimada I. Tsujimoto M. Suzuki T. Katada T. Hoshino S. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of uniformly 15N-labled TobN285. A number of signals are well dispersed in the 1H dimension, and strong signals are located at 7.8–8.5 ppm. The former well dispersed signals are characteristic of folded proteins, whereas the latter strong and narrowly dispersed signals presumably arise from unstructured regions. We obtained two spectra of the uniformly 15N-labeled TobN148 and the C-terminal fragment of Tob (residues 147–285, hereafter referred to as Tob(147–285)). The overlay of these spectra (Fig. 1B) is essentially identical to the spectrum of TobN285 (Fig. 1A), where the well dispersed signals and narrowly dispersed signals correspond to those of TobN148 and Tob(147–285), respectively. The backbone assignments of 93 residues of TobN148 out of the 130 detectable signals were established by a series of triple resonance experiments, using uniformly 13C/15N-labeled TobN148 (supplemental Fig. 1 and supplemental Table 1). A chemical shift index analysis (19Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar) provided an indication that the secondary structure of the BTG-Tob domain is consistent with the previously reported crystal structure (20Horiuchi M. Takeuchi K. Noda N. Muroya N. Suzuki T. Nakamura T. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Takahasi K. Yamamoto T. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13244-13255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, Protein Data Bank (PDB) code: 2d5r) and that the segment defined by residues 120–148 is unstructured. Thus, TobN285 consists of the N-terminal folded BTG-Tob domain followed by the C-terminal unstructured region. To investigate whether the C-terminal region of intact Tob is also unstructured, we carried out Western blotting using the N-terminally FLAG-tagged full-length protein that was expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). In addition to the main band at 58 kDa corresponding to the full-length Tob, there is smearing of bands ranging from 37 to 58 kDa, indicating that the C-terminal region of the intact protein is degraded by proteases from the cells. The high sensitivity to protease degradation suggests that most of the C-terminal region of the intact Tob protein is unstructured. We concluded that the C-terminal region of intact Tob is also unstructured. The binding affinity of TobN285 for Caf1 was investigated by ITC. Fig. 2 shows the isotherms obtained upon titration of the Caf1 solution with TobN285. The best fit of the integrated isotherms, using a single-site model, indicates a dissociation constant (Kd) value of 0.65 μm. It should be noted that a NaCl concentration of 500 mm was required to maintain the stability of Caf1. In addition, we analyzed the Caf1 binding affinity of a further truncated mutant containing the N-terminal 148 residues (TobN148), which includes the BTG-Tob domain and the N-terminal PAM2 sequence. The interaction between TobN148 and Caf1 yielded comparable thermodynamic parameters, indicating that the Caf1-binding site is within the segment defined by residues 1–148 (Table 1). ITC analysis of the interaction between TobN285 and PABC indicated the occurrence of a significant amount of heat exchange. However, the heat exchange did not become saturated at the end of the titrations (Fig. 3A, upper), and the fitting of the integrated isotherm after correcting for the heats of dilution using a one-site binding model did not converge. Thus, we fixed the binding stoichiometry at 1:1, which generated an apparent Kd value of 55 μm. An identical isotherm was obtained in the presence of Caf1 (Fig. 3A, lower), indicating that the binding of Tob to PABC is not affected by Caf1. We next carried out an ITC analysis for PABC binding, using TobN148 and Tob(147–285). Fig. 3B shows the binding isotherm obtained upon titration of PABC into a solution of Tob(147–285). The integrated isotherm was fitted using the one-site model. The fitting produced a Kd value of 20 μm with a binding stoichiometry of 1. On the other hand, essentially constant heat exchange was observed for the injections of PABC into the TobN148 solution under the same experimental conditions (including the same sample concentrations). This indicates that the interaction between TobN148 and PABC is weak (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the primary PABC-binding site is located within residues 147–285 of Tob. It should be noted that the unsaturated titration curve for the TobN285-PABC interaction is presumably caused by the weak interaction of the N-terminal 148 residues of Tob with PABC. To identify the PABC-binding site in Tob, a chemical shift perturbation (CSP) analysis was carried out. The perturbation caused by the addition of PABC to [15N]Tob(147–285) was analyzed. The HSQC spectra of [15N]Tob(147–285) revealed large spectral changes upon the addition of PABC (Fig. 4A). As expected, the spectral changes were identical to those of the 15N-labeled peptide corresponding to Tob residues 260–285 (hereafter referred to as Tob(260–285)), which includes PAM2-C (residues 265–276). This observation indicates that PAM2-C acts as the Tob-binding site within residues 147–285. This was confirmed by the ITC analyses of the binding of PABC to Tob(147–285) and Tob(260–285). These experiments produce essentially identical thermodynamic parameters (Table 2). It should be noted that another Tob construct comprising residues 121–148 (referred to as Tob(121–148)), containing PAM2-N (residues 130–141), exhibits a 6-fold lower affinity for PABC than Tob(260–285) and Tob(147–285). To investigate the Tob-binding site of PABC, a CSP analysis was carried out with perturbation produced by the addition of TobN285 to [15N]PABC (Fig. 5). The backbone assignments of free PABC (Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank entry 4915) were confirmed by a series of triple resonance experiments using uniformly 13C/15N-labeled PABC. Because the fast exchange regime was observed upon the addition of 0.5 and 1.0 equivalents of TobN285 to [15N]PABC (with the exception of three signals of Lys-580, Met-584, and Val-613 that disappeared), most of the resonance assignments were transferred to the Tob-bound state. Fig. 5B shows a plot of CSPs, which indicates that the residues exhibiting CSPs larger than 0.08 ppm are Met-561, Glu-564, His-574, Thr-576, Thr-582, L585, Ile-588, L593, Lys-606, Ala-610, Ala-612, Gln-615, His-617, and Ala-619. The three signals that disappeared presumably underwent line broadening in the intermediate exchange regime. This suggests that the CSPs for Lys-580, Met-584, and Val-613 are larger than those of the other affected residues listed above. These 17 residues include 11 residues out of 12 that exhibited large CSPs upon the addition of Paip2 (21Kozlov G. Trempe J.F. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Ekiel I. Gehring K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This indicates that Tob binds to PABPC1 through the PAM2-PABC interaction, which is shared by other PAM2-containing proteins. Previously, we proposed that Tob and Pan3 recruit deadenylases Caf1 and Pan2, respectively, to the 3′-poly(A) tail through the interaction of PAM2 in Tob-Pan3 with the PABC domain of PABPC1. The activity of the deadenylases is regulated in a translation termination-coupled manner through competition of the PAM2 motifs in eRF3 with Tob-Pan3 for PABC (16Funakoshi Y. Doi Y. Hosoda N. Uchida N. Osawa M. Shimada I. Tsujimoto M. Suzuki T. Katada T. Hoshino S. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To quantitatively address the relationship of these interactions, we performed Western blot analyses of HeLa cells to investigate expression levels of Tob, Pan3, and eRF3, relative to PABPC1, which has been reported to have a cellular level of 4 μm (22Görlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the transient and cellular expression levels of the proteins as detected by antibodies for the FLAG tag and each protein, respectively. The cellular levels of Tob, Pan3, and eRF3 were quantified and normalized to the level of PABPC1 (Fig. 6C). Although the levels of Tob and Pan3 were evaluated as the upper limit, due to the detection limit of the analysis, the cellular level of Tob was less than 6.6% of that of PABPC1 and the cellular level of Pan3 was less than 2.3% of that of PABPC1. On the basis of the cellular level of PABPC1, the levels of Tob and Pan3 are estimated to be less than 260 and 92 nm, respectively. On the other hand, eRF3 is expressed at a level similar to that of PABPC1 (4–5 μm). The NMR and Western blot analyses of Tob revealed that Tob consists of a well folded BTG-Tob N-terminal domain comprising 120 residues and the unstructured C-terminal region that contains two PAM2 motifs (Fig. 1). This observation is consistent with the report that PAM2 motifs are generally found in unstructured regions (14Albrecht M. Lengauer T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The ITC analyses indicated that the BTG-Tob domain of Tob is crucial for binding of Caf1. The C-terminal region of Tob is not involved in the binding of Caf1 (Fig. 2). Under high salt conditions (500 mm NaCl), the Kd value for the Tob-Caf1 interaction was found to be 0.6 μm (Table 1). The affinity might be much greater at a physiological salt concentration because the high concentration of NaCl appears to impair the electrostatic interactions between Tob and Caf1. The crystal structure of the TobN138-Caf1 complex (PDB code: 2d5r) contains at least three intermolecular ion pairs (Lys-51–Glu-247, Asp-65–Lys-254, and Glu-98–Lys-203) and a hydrogen bond (Glu-105–Tyr-255) at the relatively hydrophobic binding interface (20Horiuchi M. Takeuchi K. Noda N. Muroya N. Suzuki T. Nakamura T. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Takahasi K. Yamamoto T. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13244-13255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the NMR and ITC analyses revealed that the PAM2-C sequence of Tob is the primary PABC-binding site, which contributes to the binding affinity with a Kd value of 20 μm (Table 1). The PAM2-N sequence (residues, 130–141; sequence, NSFNPEAQVFMP) has binding affinity for PABC, which is 6-fold weaker than that of PAM2-C (residues, 265–276; sequence, SALSPNAKEFIF) under the salt-free conditions (Table 2). Thus, the Kd value appears to exceed 100 μm under the high salt conditions. Although the PAM2-N sequence of Tob contains conserved hydrophobic residues at positions 3, 5, 7, 10, and 12, its lower affinity for PABC is presumably a consequence of the absence of the glutamate residue at position 9, which forms hydrogen bonds with PABC via an ordered water molecule in the crystal structure of the PAM2 sequences of Paip2 complexed with PABC (23Kozlov G. Ménade M. Rosenauer A. Nguyen L. Gehring K. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 397: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, PDB code: 1i2t). The Tob-binding site of PABC is a typical PAM2-binding site. Therefore, the interaction can be competitively suppressed by other PAM2-containing proteins, such as eRF3, which has a 20-fold higher affinity for PABC than Tob and a cellular level more than 15-fold higher than that of Tob (see below). The affinity of Tob for PABC was not affected by Caf1 binding to Tob. This is consistent with the observation that the BTG-Tob domain (which binds to Caf1) and the PAM2-C sequence are separated by a 150-residue unstructured region. Thus, the binding of PABC to Tob and the binding of Caf1 to Tob are independent of each other. This indicates that the Caf1-Tob-PABPC1 ternary complex could be formed when the protein concentrations are sufficiently high with respect to their binding affinities. It was reported that purified mouse Caf1 has only 1 substituted residue with respect to human Caf1 (Asn-282 of human Caf1 is replaced by Ser), and this protein has a large Km value of 24 μm for a substrate, 35-residue RNA containing 10 adenine residues at the 3′-end (24Viswanathan P. Ohn T. Chiang Y.C. Chen J. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23988-23995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, the recruitment of Caf1 by Tob to the 3′-end of poly(A) through the Tob-PABPC1 interaction would be required to enhance the substrate accessibility of Caf1 and thus increase the deadenylase activity. However, the PABC domain of PABPC1, which includes the Tob-binding site, also binds to the translation termination factor eRF3. Although the Kd value for binding of PABC to Tob was found to be 20 μm, eRF3 was reported to possess 20-fold higher affinity for PABC (Kd = 1 μm) (25Kozlov G. De Crescenzo G. Lim N.S. Siddiqui N. Fantus D. Kahvejian A. Trempe J.F. Elias D. Ekiel I. Sonenberg N. O'Connor-McCourt M. Gehring K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that eRF3 exists in HeLa cells at a level comparable with that of the PABPC1, 4 μm (22Görlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), whereas the levels of Tob and Pan3 were estimated to be less than 260 and 92 nm, respectively (Fig. 6). Based on the Kd values and the cellular levels of these proteins, the concentrations of eRF3 and Tob that bind to PABPC1 are calculated to be 2.4 μm and less than 52 nm, respectively. This suggests that eRF3 dominates Tob in the interactions with PABPC1. We propose here that the enhanced affinity of Caf1 for the substrate would be acquired by dual interactions, which occur upon association of Caf1 with Tob: (i) the recognition of the poly(A)-bound PABPC1 by the PAM2 sequence of Tob and (ii) the poly(A) recognition by Caf1 (Fig. 7A). Because the binding energy would be expected to represent the sum of the binding energy of each interaction, the apparent affinity of the Tob-Caf1 complex for the substrate could be theoretically increased to the product of the Kd (2.0 × 10−5 m) and Km (2.4 × 10−5 m) values, i.e. 0.5 nm, although the affinity is likely to be affected to some extent by other factors, such as the distance and flexibility of the linker regions between the BTG-Tob domain and the PAM2-C sequence. Considering the low cellular level of the Tob-Caf1 complex relative to the reported Km value, the deadenylase activity should be achieved by the dual interactions, which make the deadenylase complex accessible to the 3′-end of the PABPC1-bound poly(A). The dual interactions of the Tob-Caf1 complex adequately explain how the deadenylation occurs in a translation termination-coupled manner. The comparable Kd and Km values imply that each of the dual interactions contributes equally to the affinity of the Tob-Caf1 complex for the 3′-end of poly(A). As discussed above, eRF3 dominates Tob in the interactions with PABPC1, and thus, the affinity of the Tob-Caf1 complex for the substrate would be as low as the Km level (Fig. 7B). This precludes access of the deadenylase complex to the 3′-end of poly(A) at the cellular level. The deadenylase activity of Caf1 could be considerably enhanced only when the PABC domain of the poly(A)-bound PABPC1 and the exposed poly(A) tail are simultaneously available for the interactions. This scenario is likely to occur upon recruitment of eRF3 to the ribosome for translation termination. Taken together, the combination of the two weak interactions of the Tob-Caf1 complex may not only enable access of the complex to the 3′-end of the PABPC1-bound poly(A) (even at the low cellular level of the complex) but also enable eRF3 to regulate the deadenylase activity of the Tob-Caf1 complex. The affinities and the cellular levels of the proteins involved in deadenylation provide the thermodynamic basis for the translation termination-coupled mRNA decay.

https://openalex.org/W2073923590,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) glycoprotein E (gE) is essential for virus infectivity and binds to a cellular receptor, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), through its unique amino terminal extracellular domain. Previous work has shown IDE plays an important role in VZV infection and virus cell-to-cell spread, which is the sole route for VZV spread in vitro. Here we report that a recombinant soluble IDE (rIDE) enhances VZV infectivity at an early step of infection associated with an increase in virus internalization, and increases cell-to-cell spread. VZV mutants lacking the IDE binding domain of gE were impaired for syncytia formation and membrane fusion. Pre-treatment of cell-free VZV with rIDE markedly enhanced the stability of the virus over a range of conditions. rIDE interacted with gE to elicit a conformational change in gE and rendered it more susceptible to proteolysis. Co-incubation of rIDE with gE modified the size of gE. We propose that the conformational change in gE elicited by IDE enhances infectivity and stability of the virus and leads to increased fusogenicity during VZV infection. The ability of rIDE to enhance infectivity of cell-free VZV over a wide range of incubation times and temperatures suggests that rIDE may be useful for increasing the stability of varicella or zoster vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2124633815,"Yersinia enterocolitica (Ye) is a Gram-negative bacterium; Ye serotype O:3 expresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a hexasaccharide branch known as the outer core (OC). The OC is important for the resistance of the bacterium to cationic antimicrobial peptides and also functions as a receptor for bacteriophage φR1-37 and enterocoliticin. The biosynthesis of the OC hexasaccharide is directed by the OC gene cluster that contains nine genes (wzx, wbcKLMNOPQ, and gne). In this study, we inactivated the six OC genes predicted to encode glycosyltransferases (GTase) one by one by nonpolar mutations to assign functions to their gene products. The mutants expressed no OC or truncated OC oligosaccharides of different lengths. The truncated OC oligosaccharides revealed that the minimum structural requirements for the interactions of OC with bacteriophage φR1-37, enterocoliticin, and OC-specific monoclonal antibody 2B5 were different. Furthermore, using chemical and structural analyses of the mutant LPSs, we could assign specific functions to all six GTases and also revealed the exact order in which the transferases build the hexasaccharide. Comparative modeling of the catalytic sites of glucosyltransferases WbcK and WbcL followed by site-directed mutagenesis allowed us to identify Asp-182 and Glu-181, respectively, as catalytic base residues of these two GTases. In general, conclusive evidence for specific GTase functions have been rare due to difficulties in accessibility of the appropriate donors and acceptors; however, in this work we were able to utilize the structural analysis of LPS to get direct experimental evidence for five different GTase specificities.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, represents one of the main virulence factors, and is thus studied extensively. LPS is composed of a lipid anchor (lipid A) and a carbohydrate moiety that can be subdivided into the core oligosaccharide and the O-specific polysaccharide (OPS). 3The abbreviations used are: OPSO-specific polysaccharideESI FT-ICR MSelectrospray ionization Fourier-transformed ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometryGTaseglycosyltransferaseOCouter coreSugp2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-d-xylo-hex-4-ulopyranoseUnd-Pundecaprenyl phosphateYeY. enterocoliticaDOCdeoxycholate. In the case of Enterobacteriaceae, the core oligosaccharide may be further divided into the inner and outer core (OC). The surface-exposed parts of LPS can also provide different receptor structures for bacteriophages (1Holst O. Müller-Loennies S. Kamerling J.P. Boons G.-J. Lee Y.C. Suzuki A. Taniguchi N.

Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 (Ye O:3) is a human pathogen causing yersiniosis that is usually a diarrheal disease. A special characteristic in Ye O:3 is that both OPS and OC are linked to the lipid A core, and this has made it possible to construct mutants expressing different combinations of OPS and OC (2Biedzka-Sarek M. Venho R. Skurnik M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2232-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Ye O:3 OPS and OC structures are important to the virulence of the pathogen (3al-Hendy A. Toivanen P. Skurnik M. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 870-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Skurnik M. Venho R. Bengoechea J.A. Moriyón I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1443-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that OC plays an important role in the resistance to antimicrobial peptides, key weapons of the innate immune system, and outer membrane integrity (4Skurnik M. Venho R. Bengoechea J.A. Moriyón I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1443-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The OC hexasaccharide is composed of two d-glucopyranoses (d-Glcp), one d-galactopyranose (d-Galp), one 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-d-xylo-hex-4-ulopyranose (Sugp, present in two forms, i.e. possessing either a keto or, due to the addition of water, a diol group at C4), and two 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactopyranose (GalpNAc) residues (5Pinta E. Duda K.A. Hanuszkiewicz A. Kaczyński Z. Lindner B. Miller W.L. Hyytiäinen H. Vogel C. Borowski S. Kasperkiewicz K. Lam J.S. Radziejewska-Lebrecht J. Skurnik M. Holst O.

Pol. 1998; 45: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of the Ye O:3 OC is believed to proceed similar to the biosynthesis of heteropolymeric OPS (7Skurnik M. Venho R. Toivanen P. al-Hendy A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), i.e. by sequential transfer of sugar residues to the carrier-lipid undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P). As soon as the correct NDP-sugar precursors have been synthesized, the sugar residues are transferred one by one to a growing sugar chain on the Und-P. The initiation reaction to transfer Sugp-1-P onto Und-P should be catalyzed by a polyisoprenyl phosphate N-acetylhexosamine 1-phosphate-type priming GTase followed by five different GTases to generate the five glycosidic linkages of the outer core hexasaccharide. The OC gene cluster has been cloned and sequenced (7Skurnik M. Venho R. Toivanen P. al-Hendy A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The Ye O:3 OC gene cluster expressed by plasmid pRV16NP fully restores OC expression of Ye O:3 strain that has the OC gene cluster deleted from the genome. pRV16NP also allows OC expression in heterologous hosts such as Escherichia coli (8Kiljunen S. Hakala K. Pinta E. Huttunen S. Pluta P. Gador A. Lönnberg H. Skurnik M. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 4093-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). According to the sequence data, functions for the nine different gene products of the OC gene cluster were postulated (4Skurnik M. Venho R. Bengoechea J.A. Moriyón I. Mol.

However, only two gene products have been experimentally documented, i.e. the gne gene product, which is a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.7) (13Bengoechea J.A. Pinta E. Salminen T. Oertelt C. Holst O. Radziejewska-Lebrecht J. Piotrowska-Seget Z. Venho R. Skurnik M. J.

Chemistry. 2009; 15: 9747-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For the rest of the genes, the wzx gene is postulated to encode a flippase translocating the Und-P-linked oligosaccharide through the inner membrane (6Radziejewska-Lebrecht J. Skurnik M. Shashkov A.S. Brade L. Rózalski A. Bartodziejska B. Mayer H. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1998; 45: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas the remaining six genes wbcKLMNOQ are postulated to encode the five different GTases and the priming transferase needed to form the unique linkages connecting the monosaccharides of the OC hexasaccharide during the biosynthesis of OC onto Und-P (7Skurnik M. Venho R. Toivanen P. al-Hendy A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). GTases have been classified to sequence-based families by Campbell et al. (14Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), and the classification has been further developed by Coutinho et al. (15Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). The continuously updated information is available in the Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy). In the glycosylation reaction, the stereochemistry at the C1 position of the donor sugar (here UDP-sugar) can remain or change. According to that, the GTases are either retaining or inverting, respectively. However, a reliable prediction of the catalytic mechanism (inverting or retaining) is not always possible based on sequence comparison alone (16Breton C. Snajdrová L. Jeanneau C. Koca J. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 29R-37RCrossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). According to the solved x-ray structures, GTase folds have been observed to consist primarily of α/β/α sandwiches. Added to this, GTases seem to mainly fall in two structural superfamilies as follows: the GT-A and GT-B. Inverting and retaining GTases are found in both superfamilies. GT-A family GTases seem to have two characteristic regions. The first region (100–120 N-terminal residues) corresponds to the Rossmann-type nucleotide binding domain (α/β/α sandwich), and it is terminated by a general feature of the GT-A family, the DXD motif. The DXD motif has been shown to interact with the phosphate groups of the nucleotide donor through the coordination of a divalent cation, typically Mn2+. The C-terminal portion of the GT-A GTase is highly variable, mostly dedicated to the recognition of the acceptor, but a common β-α-α structural motif forming a part of the active site is seen. In inverting enzymes, the presumed catalytic base has been proposed in this region. The ratio of loops to secondary elements is high in GTases, and the flexible loops appear to be important for the substrate binding (16Breton C. Snajdrová L. Jeanneau C. Koca J. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 29R-37RCrossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Ye O:3 LPS serves as a receptor for bacteriophages ϕR1-37 and ϕYeO3-12, the former uses OC (8Kiljunen S. Hakala K. Pinta E. Huttunen S. Pluta P. Gador A. Lönnberg H. Skurnik M. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 4093-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the latter uses the OPS as a receptor (17Pajunen M. Kiljunen S. Skurnik M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5114-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Enterocoliticin is a channel-forming bacteriocin produced by Y. enterocolitica 29930 (biogroup 1A; serogroup O:7,8) that also uses the Ye O:3 OC as its receptor (18Strauch E. Kaspar H. Schaudinn C. Damasko C. Konietzny A. Dersch P. Skurnik M. Appel B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2003; 529: 249-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); it kills enteropathogenic strains of Y. enterocolitica belonging to serogroups O:3, O:5,27, and O:9 (19Strauch E. Kaspar H. Schaudinn C. Dersch P. Madela K. Gewinner C. Hertwig S. Wecke J. Appel B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5634-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Finally, the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2B5 also recognizes the OC hexasaccharide (5Pinta E. Duda K.A. Hanuszkiewicz A. Kaczyński Z. Lindner B. Miller W.L. Hyytiäinen H. Vogel C. Borowski S.

Granfors K. Toivanen A. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. C. 1987; 95: 27-34PubMed Google Scholar). The structural OC requirements for these specificities have not been characterized previously. In this study, we assign the individual catalytic specificities for all the six transferases needed for the biosynthesis of the Ye O:3 OC and establish the exact order by which they build the hexasaccharide. We used in silico modeling to identify catalytic residues of WbcK and WbcL and proved the predictions by site-directed substitutions of the residues. In addition, we analyzed the contribution of OPS and OC to polymyxin B resistance and demonstrated the minimum structural OC requirements for the interactions of bacteriophage ϕR1-37, enterocoliticin, and mAb 2B5. To our knowledge, there are no GTases with the equivalent specificities characterized so far. Bacterial strains used in this work are listed in Table 1. Yersinia strains were grown in tryptic soy broth at room temperature (20–25 °C) and E. coli strains in Luria Broth at 37 °C. Luria agar was used for all solid cultures. When required, appropriate antibiotics were added (20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline).TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this workStrain/plasmidGenotypeRef.Y. enterocolitica 6471/76 (=YeO3)Wild type strain, patient isolate50Skurnik M.

Strains expressing mutated OC genes were constructed by mutating the OC genes of plasmid pRV16NP individually as described below. Plasmid pRV16NP contains the OC gene cluster cloned into plasmid vector pTM100 so that it is constitutively transcribed under the tetracycline promoter of the vector. The obtained plasmids pRV16NPwbcK2, pRV16NPwbcL1, pRV16NPwbcM1, and pRV16NPwbcQ1 were mobilized from the E. coli host by triparental conjugation into the OC negative Y. enterocolitica strain YeO3-c-OC-R using E. coli HB101/pRK2013 as a helper strain as described earlier (2Biedzka-Sarek M. Venho R. Skurnik M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2232-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To mutate the OC genes, single restriction sites were identified within each gene (Table 2). These sites were mutated as follows: either by (i) removal of overhangs by mung bean nuclease according to the instructions by the supplier (New England Biolabs); (ii) removal of 3′-overhangs by T4 DNA polymerase, or (iii) fill in 5′-overhangs by T4 DNA polymerase according to the instructions by the supplier (Promega). Plasmid pRV16NP was digested with selected restriction enzyme, blunted with one of the options above, and then self-ligated. Each mutated gene and corresponding restriction site as well as the enzyme used for blunting and the name of the resulting plasmid are listed in Table 2. All the mutations were designed to change the reading frame of the target gene.TABLE 2Strategies for construction of nonpolar mutations in OC gene clusterGene, range in accession no.

Open table in a new tab Plasmids pYeO3wbcK, pYeO3wbcL, pYeO3wbcM, and pYeO3wbcQ were generated by amplifying genes wbcK, wbcL, wbcM, and wbcQ of YeO3-c by PCR with primer pairs shown in supplemental Table S1 using Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) and following PCR cycles 98 °C for 30 s (98 °C for 11 s, 53 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s) 35 times at 72 °C for 7 min. The obtained PCR fragments were purified with quantum prep PCR Kleen kit (Bio-Rad), digested with enzymes whose recognition sites were present in primers and are shown in supplemental Table S1, and ligated with pET28a that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. To clone wbcN, the 1.8-kb NcoI fragment of pRV16NP was cloned into NcoI site of pTM100, and to clone wbcO, the 2.1-kb MscI/XmnI fragment of pRV16NP was cloned into EcoRV site of pTM100. The constructed plasmids were named pTM100wbcN and pTM100wbcO, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of the wbcK and wbcL was performed by PCR as described previously (13Bengoechea J.A. Pinta E. Salminen T. Oertelt C. Holst O. Radziejewska-Lebrecht J. Piotrowska-Seget Z. Venho R. Skurnik M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4277-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmids pYeO3wbcK and pYeO3wbcL were used as templates, and the desired mutations were introduced by the primer pairs described in supplemental Table S1. PCR was carried out using Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) and the following PCR cycles: 98 °C for 30 s (98 °C for 10 s, 48 or 43 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min) 35 times and 72 °C for 7 min. The obtained PCR fragments were gel-purified, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, ligated, and finally subjected to DpnI digestion to break down any remaining template plasmid. The ligated PCR products were transformed to E. coli JM109, and the generated substitutions were confirmed by sequencing. The constructed plasmids were named pYeO3wbcK-Ala, pYeO3wbcK-Ser, pYeO3wbcL-Ala, pYeO3wbcL-Gln, and pYeO3wbcL-Thr. The OC is expressed in E. coli transformed with pRV16NP carrying the OC gene cluster (8Kiljunen S. Hakala K. Pinta E. Huttunen S. Pluta P. Gador A. Lönnberg H. Skurnik M. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 4093-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and we used this possibility in trans-complementation experiments. The two plasmids carrying the wild type gene in pET28 and the corresponding pRV16NPwbc-mutant were co-introduced to competent E. coli NovaBlue(DE3) cells by electroporation. To express the wild type gene, the T7 RNA polymerase activity of the host strain was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the OC-phenotype was analyzed as described below. To experimentally test the effects of the substitution mutations of WbcK and WbcL on the enzymatic activity, the ability of the mutated proteins to complement the wbcK and wbcL mutants, respectively, was assayed. To this end, plasmids pYeO3wbcK-Ala and pYeO3wbcK-Ser were co-introduced with pRV16NPwbcK2 and plasmids pYeO3wbcL-Ala, pYeO3wbcL-Gln and pYeO3wbcL-Thr were co-introduced with pRV16NPwbcL, respectively, to NovaBlue(DE3). The gene expression was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described above, and the OC-phenotypes were analyzed by DOC-PAGE and immunoblotting as described below. The expression of the His-tagged proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting using the monoclonal mouse anti-polyhistidine antibody HIS-1 (H1029, Sigma). To study the complementation of the wbcN and wbcO mutants, plasmids pTM100wbcN and pTM100wbcO were introduced to strains YeO3-c-wbcN1-R and YeO3-wbcO1-R, respectively, by triparental conjugation using as helper strain E. coli HB101/pRK2013, as described earlier (22Zhang L. Toivanen P. Skurnik M. Contrib. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 13: 310-313PubMed Google Scholar). LPS phenotypes were analyzed by silver-stained DOC-PAGE of isolated LPS samples as described previously (7Skurnik M. Venho R. Toivanen P. al-Hendy A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Zhang L. Skurnik M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1756-1760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reactivity of mAb 2B5 was tested by immunoblotting LPS samples from DOC-PAGE to nitrocellulose filters as described previously (2Biedzka-Sarek M. Venho R. Skurnik M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2232-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The LPSs were extracted with hot phenol/water (24Jann K. Jann B. Orskov F. Orskov I. Westphal O. Biochem. Z. 1965; 342: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar) followed by enzymatic treatment (DNase, RNase (37 °C, 12 h), and proteinase K (56 °C, 12 h)) and ultracentrifugation (two times at 105,000 × g, 4 °C, 12 h). Sugar analyses were performed as described previously (25Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Oertelt C. Lindner B. Skurnik M. Holst O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Methylation was carried out according to Ciucanu and Kerek (27Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). For reduction of Sugp, LPS was treated with anhydrous hydrazine (37 °C, 30 min). The core oligosaccharide from YeO3-c-OC-R/pRV16NPwbcK2 was obtained after acetate buffer hydrolysis (pH 4.4, 100 °C, 5 h). Electrospray ionization Fourier-transformed cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS) experiments were performed as described previously (5Pinta E. Duda K.A. Hanuszkiewicz A. Kaczyński Z. Lindner B. Miller W.L. Hyytiäinen H. Vogel C. Borowski S. Kasperkiewicz K. Lam J.S. Radziejewska-Lebrecht J. Skurnik M. Holst O.

Different strains were tested for their ϕR1-37 and enterocoliticin sensitivities by pipetting 5 μl of serial dilutions of phage or enterocoliticin stocks (2 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml and 2 × 106 activity units/ml, respectively) on a freshly grown and dried bacterial lawn and observing the formation of a clear lysis zone after 24 h of incubation. Strains expressing different truncated OCs were tested for their polymyxin B sensitivity as described earlier (28Bengoechea J.A. Najdenski H. Skurnik M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 451-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. J. Immunol.

Briefly, an overlay gel that contained 1% (w/v) agarose (SeaKem LE agarose, FMC, Rockland, ME), 2 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), and 0.3 mg of tryptic soy broth (Oxoid) powder per ml was equilibrated at 50 °C and inoculated with the different bacteria to a final concentration of 5 × 105 colony-forming units per ml of molten gel. This gel was poured into standard square Petri dishes (10 × 10 × 1.5 cm), and after solidification, small wells of 15-μl capacities were carved. Aliquots of 10 μl of polymyxin B were added to the wells, and plates were incubated for 3 h at the bacterial growth temperature. After that, a 30-ml overlay gel composed of 1% agarose and 6% tryptic soy broth powder in water was poured on top of the previous one, and the plates were incubated at the bacterial growth temperature. After 18 h, the diameters of the inhibition halos were measured to the nearest 1 mm, and after subtracting the diameter of the wel"
https://openalex.org/W2054931537,"Fungal pathogens can be lethal, especially among immunocompromised populations, such as patients with AIDS and recipients of tissue transplantation or chemotherapy. Prolonged usage of antifungal reagents can lead to drug resistance and treatment failure. Understanding mechanisms that underlie drug resistance by pathogenic microorganisms is thus vital for dealing with this emerging issue. In this study, we show that dramatic sequence changes in PDR5, an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) efflux transporter protein gene in an opportunistic fungal pathogen, caused the organism to become hypersensitive to azole, a widely used antifungal drug. Surprisingly, the same mutations conferred growth advantages to the organism on polyenes, which are also commonly used antimycotics. Our results indicate that Pdr5p might be important for ergosterol homeostasis. The observed remarkable sequence divergence in the PDR5 gene in yeast strain YJM789 may represent an interesting case of adaptive loss of gene function with significant clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2005218053,"Antioxidant vitamins are often described as having ""independent"" associations with risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. We aimed to compare to what extent a range of antioxidant vitamins and carotenoids are associated with adulthood and childhood markers of socioeconomic deprivation and to adverse lifestyle factors.Socioeconomic and lifestyle measures were available in 1040 men and 1298 women from the MIDSPAN Family Study (30-59 years at baseline) together with circulating levels of vitamins A, C, E, and carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein and lycopene). Markers of socioeconomic deprivation in adulthood were consistently as strongly associated with lower vitamin C and carotenoid levels as markers of adverse lifestyle; the inverse association with overcrowding was particularly consistent (vitamin C and carotenoids range from 19.1% [95% CI 30.3-6.0] to 38.8% [49.9-25.3] lower among those in overcrowded residencies). These associations were consistent after adjusting for month, classical CVD risk factors, body mass index, physical activity, vitamin supplements, dietary fat and fibre intake. Similar, but weaker, associations were seen for childhood markers of deprivation. The association of vitamin A or E were strikingly different; several adult adverse lifestyle factors associated with higher levels of vitamin A and E, including high alcohol intake for vitamin A (9.5% [5.7-13.5]) and waist hip ratio for vitamin E (9.5% [4.8-14.4]), with the latter associations partially explained by classical risk factors, particularly cholesterol levels.Plasma vitamin C and carotenoids have strong inverse associations with adulthood markers of social deprivation, whereas vitamin A and E appear positively related to specific adverse lifestyle factors. These findings should help researchers better contextualize blood antioxidant vitamin levels by illustrating the potential limitations associated with making causal inferences without consideration of social deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W2062034332,"The association between baseline seropositivity to human adenovirus (HAdV) type 5 and increased HIV acquisition in the Step HIV Vaccine Study has raised questions concerning frequency of acquired and/or persistent Adenovirus infections among adults at high risk of HIV-1 infection.To evaluate the frequency and pattern of HAdV shedding from the lower GI tract, we retrospectively tested rectal swabs for HAdVs in a cohort of 20 HSV-2 positive HIV-positive Peruvian men who have sex with men (MSM) undergoing rectal swabbing three times/week for 18 consecutive weeks, in a prospective study of HSV-2 suppression in HIV infection. Viral DNA was extracted and amplified using a sensitive multiplex PCR assay that detects all currently recognized HAdV types. Molecular typing of viruses was performed on selected samples by hexon gene sequencing. Baseline neutralizing antibody titers to HAdVs -5, -26, -35 and -48 were also assessed.15/20 individuals had HAdV detected during follow up. The median frequency of HAdV detection was 30% of samples (range 2.0% to 64.7%). HAdV shedding typically occurred on consecutive days in clustered episodes lasting a median of 4 days (range 1 to 9 days) separated by periods without shedding, suggesting frequent new infections or reactivation of latent infections over time. 8 of the 15 shedders had more than one type detected in follow-up. 20 HAdV types from species B, C, and D were identified, including HAdV-5, -26 and -48, HAdV types under development as potential vaccine candidates. 14/20 subjects were seropositive for HAdV-5; 15/20 for HAdV-26; 3/20 for HAdV-35; and 2/20 for HAdV-48. HAdV shedding did not correlate with CD4 count, plasma HIV-1 viral load, or titers to HAdV-5 or HAdV-35. The sole individual with HAdV-5 shedding was HAdV-5 seropositive.HAdV shedding was highly prevalent and diverse, including types presently under consideration as HIV vaccine vectors. Subclinical HAdV infection of the GI tract is common among MSM in Peru; the prevalence of HAdV in the enteric tract should be evaluated in other populations. The association between ongoing recent enteric HAdV and the immune response to recombinant HAdV vaccines should be evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W1970971618,"Methamphetamine (MA) is a new arrival to the Southeastern United States (US). Incidence of HIV is also increasing regionally, but data are limited regarding any association between this trend and MA use. We examined behavioral data from North Carolina (NC) residents newly diagnosed with HIV, collected by the Department of Health between 2000-2005.Among 1,460 newly diagnosed HIV-positive young men, an increasing trend was seen from 2000-2005 in MA use (p = 0.01, total n = 20). In bivariate analyses, users of MA had significantly greater odds of reporting other substance use, including alcohol, powder or crack cocaine, marijuana, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy""). They were also more likely to have reported sexual activity while traveling outside NC; sex with anonymous partners; and previous HIV testing. In a predictive model, MA use had a negative association with nonwhite race, and strong positive associations with powder cocaine, ""ecstasy,"" or intravenous drug use and being a university student.Similar to trends seen in more urban parts of the US, MA use among newly diagnosed, HIV-positive young men is increasing in NC. These data are among the first to demonstrate this relationship in a region with a burgeoning epidemic of MA use. Opportunities exist for MA-related HIV risk-reduction interventions whenever young men intersect the healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W2089818552,"Background The cause of isolated gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty (PP) with an ovarian cyst is unknown in the majority of cases. Here, we describe 11 new cases of peripheral PP and, based on phenotypes observed in mouse models, we tested the hypothesis that mutations in the GNAS1, NR5A1, LHCGR, FSHR, NR5A1, StAR, DMRT4 and NOBOX may be associated with this phenotype. Methodology/Principal Findings 11 girls with gonadotropin-independent PP were included in this study. Three girls were seen for a history of prenatal ovarian cyst, 6 girls for breast development, and 2 girls for vaginal bleeding. With one exception, all girls were seen before 8 years of age. In 8 cases, an ovarian cyst was detected, and in one case, suspected. One other case has polycystic ovaries, and the remaining case was referred for vaginal bleeding. Four patients had a familial history of ovarian anomalies and/or infertility. Mutations in the coding sequences of the candidate genes GNAS1, NR5A1, LHCGR, FSHR, NR5A1, StAR, DMRT4 and NOBOX were not observed. Conclusions/Significance Ovarian PP shows markedly different clinical features from central PP. Our data suggest that mutations in the GNAS1, NR5A1, LHCGR, FSHR StAR, DMRT4 and NOBOX genes are not responsible for ovarian PP. Further research, including the identification of familial cases, is needed to understand the etiology of ovarian PP."
