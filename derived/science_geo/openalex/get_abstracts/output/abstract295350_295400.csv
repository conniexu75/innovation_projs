Laser-driven chemical reactions of calcium and strontium vapors with a variety of small molecules have provided many new free radicals. In general, these species are analogous to the stable molecules obtained in traditional inorganic or organometallic chemistry, but some new families of molecules have been discovered."
https://openalex.org/W2133157263,Tectonic stress fields in the overriding plate at convergent plate margins are complex and vary on local to regional scales. Volcanic arcs are a common element of overriding plates. Stress fields in the volcanic arc region are related to deformation generated by subduction and to magma generation and ascent processes. Analysis of moment tensors of shallow and intermediate depth earthquakes in volcanic arcs indicates that the seismic strain field in the arc region of many convergent margins is subhorizontal extension oriented nearly perpendicular to the arc. A process capable of generating such a globally consistent strain field is induced asthenospheric corner flow below the arc region.

https://openalex.org/W1985138513,"The news about Earth's ozone layer just keeps getting worse. Three weeks ago, NASA researchers reported that the ozone hole over the Antarctic hit a record depth this year. Now comes the United Nations Environment Program, together with the World Meteorological Organization, with an even more distressing assessment of the state of the ozone layer. For the first time, the 80-member UN panel said, measurements show the ozone shield is eroding over temperate latitudes in summer, exposing crops and people to a larger dose of ultraviolet light just when they are most vulnerable. For a small group of atmospheric modelers, though, the bad news is bittersweet. Four months ago researchers predicted summertime ozone losses of just the magnitude the UN panel has now reported: about 3% over the past decade for northern temperate latitudes. Ozone modelers are encouraged by the agreement, particularly because other models are now yielding the same result. The modeling effort was spurred by earlier measurements showing a serious erosion of ozone at midlatitudes, mainly in winter. In 1988, an analysis of data collected from the ground showed that ozone levels at the latitude of the US were dropping by about 1% to 3% per decade; lastmore » April, an analysis of measurements from the satellite-borne Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer boosted that figure to between 4% and 5%. Those findings raised the question: What mechanisms could be driving the midlatitude losses The fact that the losses seemed to be concentrated in winter suggested one possibility. The winter ozone losses at the poles are driven by chemical reactions taking place on the surface of ice crystals in polar stratospheric clouds. Such clouds don't form at temperate latitudes. But some researchers suggested that masses of air already depleted in ozone or enriched in reactive chlorine by the chemistry in the polar clouds might be escaping to temperate latitudes during the winter.« less"

Huxley was perhaps not the first but at least he was the most forceful in his demand that preliminary to all understanding and development of thought was a definition of terms. Men in the scien tific world will have no difficulty in making a distinction between the fields of pure and applied science. It is, however, not so clear in industry or in our governmental relations and sometimes even in our educational institutions."

https://openalex.org/W4210551229,"Could it be the thinning of the ozone layer (see p. 645) that has indirectly caused our baffling faux pas in recent issues? In reporting the formation by the National Academy of Sciences of a Committee on Environmental Research to be headed by Cornell President Emeritus Dale Corson (11 October, p. 192), we inexplicably fused the distinguished careers of physicist Corson and former Dartmouth president John Kemeny. It was the latter who headed the President's Commission that investigated the accident at Three Mile Island, whereas Corson's distinctions include heading the NAS's ""Corson Panel"" on scientific communications and national security and founding the Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable. Three weeks earlier (in ""Mycomummy,"" 20 September, p. 1353), we misspelled Coccidioides, a fungus whose petrified spores were found in the ancient skeleton of a Sinaguan indian."
