https://openalex.org/W3198097576,"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are conservation tools intended to protect biodiversity, promote healthy and resilient marine ecosystems, and provide societal benefits. Despite codification of MPAs in international agreements, MPA effectiveness is currently undermined by confusion about the many MPA types and consequent wildly differing outcomes. We present a clarifying science-driven framework—The MPA Guide—to aid design and evaluation. The guide categorizes MPAs by stage of establishment and level of protection, specifies the resulting direct and indirect outcomes for biodiversity and human well-being, and describes the key conditions necessary for positive outcomes. Use of this MPA Guide by scientists, managers, policy-makers, and communities can improve effective design, implementation, assessment, and tracking of existing and future MPAs to achieve conservation goals by using scientifically grounded practices."

We use observational analysis to show that a lesser-known stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) disruption that involves wave reflection and stretching of the SPV is linked with extreme cold across parts of Asia and North America, including the recent February 2021 Texas cold wave, and has been increasing over the satellite era. We then use numerical modeling experiments forced with trends in autumn snow cover and Arctic sea ice to establish a physical link between Arctic change and SPV stretching and related surface impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3196856456,"Recently, exceptional points, a degeneracy of open wave systems, have been observed in photonics, acoustics, and electronics. They have mainly been realized as a degeneracy of resonances; however, a degeneracy associated with the absorption of waves can exhibit distinct and interesting physical features. Here, we demonstrate such an absorbing exceptional point by engineering degeneracies in the absorption spectrum of dissipative optical microcavities. We experimentally distinguished the conditions to realize an absorbing exceptional point versus a resonant exceptional point. Furthermore, when the optical loss was tuned to achieve perfect absorption at an absorbing exceptional point, we observed its signature, an anomalously broadened line shape in the absorption spectrum. The distinct scattering properties of the absorbing exceptional point create opportunities for both fundamental study and applications of non-Hermitian degeneracies."
https://openalex.org/W3198453274,"Resonant scattering, guided mode propagation phase, and/or orientation-dependent phase retardations are the three main mechanisms used to date to conceive optical metasurfaces. Here, we introduce an additional degree of freedom to address optical phase engineering by exploiting the topological features of non-Hermitian matrices operating near their singular points. Choosing metasurface building blocks to encircle a singularity following an arbitrarily closed trajectory in parameter space, we engineered a topologically protected full 2π-phase on a specific reflected polarization channel. The ease of implementation together with its compatibility with other phase-addressing mechanisms bring topological properties into the realm of industrial applications at optical frequencies and prove that metasurface technology represents a convenient test bench to study and validate topological photonic concepts."
https://openalex.org/W3198782993,"Biomolecular condensates are cellular compartments that can form by phase separation in the absence of limiting membranes. Studying the P granules of Caenorhabditis elegans, we find that condensate dynamics are regulated by protein clusters that adsorb to the condensate interface. Using in vitro reconstitution, live observations, and theory, we demonstrate that localized assembly of P granules is controlled by MEG-3, an intrinsically disordered protein that forms low dynamic assemblies on P granules. Following classic Pickering emulsion theory, MEG-3 clusters lower surface tension and slow down coarsening. During zygote polarization, MEG-3 recruits the DYRK family kinase MBK-2 to accelerate spatially regulated growth of the P granule emulsion. By tuning condensate-cytoplasm exchange, interfacial clusters regulate the structural integrity of biomolecular condensates, reminiscent of the role of lipid bilayers in membrane-bound organelles."
https://openalex.org/W3198109096,"The dynamics of strongly interacting many-body quantum systems are notoriously complex and difficult to simulate. A recently proposed theory called generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) promises to efficiently accomplish such simulations for nearly integrable systems. We test GHD with bundles of ultracold one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases by performing large trap quenches in both the strong and intermediate coupling regimes. We find that theory and experiment agree well over dozens of trap oscillations, for average dimensionless coupling strengths that range from 0.3 to 9.3. Our results show that GHD can accurately describe the quantum dynamics of a 1D nearly integrable experimental system even when particle numbers are low and density changes are large and fast."
https://openalex.org/W3198897305,"Chromatin state and oncogenic competence Although specific DNA mutations can lead to tumor generation, they are not transforming in all cellular contexts. This may be due to the intrinsic transcriptional program present in the cell of origin. Using zebrafish and human pluripotent stem cell cancer models, Baggiolini et al . report that neural crest cells and melanoblasts (precursors to melanocytes) are susceptible to specific mutation of the BRAF gene, whereas melanocytes are relatively resistant (see the Perspective by Vredevoogd and Peeper). The competent cells display higher levels of chromatin factors such as the protein ATAD2 compared with the less competent ones. ATAD2 forms a complex with the neural crest transcription factor SOX10 and establishes a chromatin state that makes them permissive to BRAF mutagenesis. These data indicate that developmental chromatin programs are a determinant of how cells respond to DNA mutations. —BAP"

This study reveals the tightly controlled molecular choreography by which an ensemble of assembly factors controls early irreversible maturation steps that bring about the formation of the human SSU. —DJ"
https://openalex.org/W3197551171,"Phase-change memory (PCM) is a promising candidate for data storage in flexible electronics, but its high switching current and power are often drawbacks. In this study, we demonstrate a switching current density of ~0.1 mega-ampere per square centimeter in flexible superlattice PCM, a value that is one to two orders of magnitude lower than in conventional PCM on flexible or silicon substrates. This reduced switching current density is enabled by heat confinement in the superlattice material, assisted by current confinement in a pore-type device and the thermally insulating flexible substrate. Our devices also show multilevel operation with low resistance drift. The low switching current and good resistance on/off ratio are retained before, during, and after repeated bending and cycling. These results pave the way to low-power memory for flexible electronics and also provide key insights for PCM optimization on conventional silicon substrates."
https://openalex.org/W3196297321,"Defeating peripheral neuropathy The mechanisms underlying peripheral neuropathies are not well understood. Spaulding et al . studied mouse models of the inherited Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, which is caused by mutations in transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases. Changes in gene expression and the rate of protein synthesis in neurons in the spinal cord triggered the cell stress response activated by the protein sensor GCN2. When GCN2 was genetically deleted or inhibited with drugs, the stress response was blocked, and the neuropathy was much milder. Zuko et al . found that mutant glycyl-tRNA synthetases bind tRNA Gly but fail to release it, thus depleting the cellular tRNA Gly pool. This process caused stalling of translating ribosomes on glycine codons and activated the integrated stress response. Transgenic tRNA Gly overexpression prevented peripheral neuropathy and protein synthesis defects in mouse and fruit fly models. Thus, elevating tRNA Gly levels or targeting GCN2 may have therapeutic potential for this currently untreatable disease (see the Perspective by Mellado and Willis). —SMH"
https://openalex.org/W3200514630,"In the cuprates, one-dimensional (1D) chain compounds provide a distinctive opportunity to understand the microscopic physics, owing to the availability of reliable theories. However, progress has been limited by the challenge of controllably doping these materials. We report the synthesis and spectroscopic analysis of the 1D cuprate Ba2-xSrxCuO3+δ over a wide range of hole doping. Our angle-resolved photoemission experiments reveal the doping evolution of the holon and spinon branches. We identify a prominent folding branch whose intensity fails to match predictions of the simple Hubbard model. An additional strong near-neighbor attraction, which may arise from coupling to phonons, quantitatively explains experiments for all accessible doping levels. Considering structural and quantum chemistry similarities among cuprates, this attraction may play a similarly important role in high-temperature cuprate superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W3197177167,"Linking flowering to ambient temperature In the small mustard plant Arabidopsis , the florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) mobilizes to initiate flowering at the shoot apical meristem. Susila et al . now show that FT, which is produced in leaf cells, can be held in reserve if ambient temperatures are not favorable (see the Perspective by Jaillais and Parcy). At low temperatures, FT binds a membrane phosopholipid and is thus restricted in mobility. At higher temperatures, such binding is less favored, and FT is released to mobilize into the shoot apical meristem to drive flowering. Thus, temperature-sensitive lipid binding helps the plant time flowering with favorable ambient temperatures. —PJH"

https://openalex.org/W3196441931,"Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) acutely disrupts the cortex, most TBI-related disabilities reflect secondary injuries that accrue over time. The thalamus is a likely site of secondary damage because of its reciprocal connections with the cortex. Using a mouse model of mild TBI (mTBI), we found a chronic increase in C1q expression specifically in the corticothalamic system. Increased C1q expression colocalized with neuron loss and chronic inflammation and correlated with disruption in sleep spindles and emergence of epileptic activities. Blocking C1q counteracted these outcomes, suggesting that C1q is a disease modifier in mTBI. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing demonstrated that microglia are a source of thalamic C1q. The corticothalamic circuit could thus be a new target for treating TBI-related disabilities."
https://openalex.org/W3197612957,"Compulsive drug use despite adverse consequences defines addiction. While mesolimbic dopamine signaling is sufficient to drive compulsion, psychostimulants such as cocaine also boost extracellular serotonin (5-HT) by inhibiting reuptake. We used SERT Met172 knockin (SertKI) mice carrying a transporter that no longer binds cocaine to abolish 5-HT transients during drug self-administration. SertKI mice showed an enhanced transition to compulsion. Conversely, pharmacologically elevating 5-HT reversed the inherently high rate of compulsion transition with optogenetic dopamine self-stimulation. The bidirectional effect on behavior is explained by presynaptic depression of orbitofrontal cortex–to–dorsal striatum synapses induced by 5-HT via 5-HT1B receptors. Consequently, in projection-specific 5-HT1B receptor knockout mice, the fraction of individuals compulsively self-administering cocaine was elevated."
https://openalex.org/W3197087981,"Glasses have numerous applications because of their exceptional transparency and stiffness; however, poor fracture, impact resistance, and mechanical reliability limit the range of their applications. Recent bioinspired glasses have shown superior mechanical performance, but they still suffer from reduced optical quality. Here, we present a nacreous glass composite that offers a combination of strength, toughness, and transparency. Micrometer-sized glass tablets and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were mixed and structured by centrifugation, creating dense PMMA-glass layers. A transparent composite was created by tuning the refractive index of PMMA to that of glass and using chemical functionalization to create continuous interfaces. The fabrication method is robust and scalable, and the composite may prove to be a glass alternative in diverse applications."
https://openalex.org/W3197827479,"When twisted to angles near 1°, graphene multilayers provide a window on electron correlation physics. Here, we report the discovery of a correlated electron-hole state in double-bilayer graphene twisted to 2.37°. At this angle, the moiré states retain much of their isolated bilayer character, allowing their bilayer projections to be separately controlled by gates. We use this property to generate an energetic overlap between narrow isolated electron and hole bands with good nesting properties. Our measurements reveal the formation of ordered states with reconstructed Fermi surfaces, consistent with a density-wave state. This state can be tuned without introducing chemical dopants, enabling studies of correlated electron-hole states and their interplay with superconductivity."

The authors incorporated all of these reagents into a unified P(V)-based synthesis platform capable of running at high efficiency on a commercial automated solid-phase synthesizer. They demonstrate the flexibility of this system by producing oligonucleotides with all three linkage types in specific positions. Access to such precisely constructed molecules opens new approaches to therapeutic oligonucleotide design. —MAF"

https://openalex.org/W3197234948,"Angular momentum plays a central role in quantum mechanics, recurring in every length scale from the microscopic interactions of light and matter to the macroscopic behavior of superfluids. Vortex beams, carrying intrinsic orbital angular momentum (OAM), are now regularly generated with elementary particles such as photons and electrons. Thus far, the creation of a vortex beam of a nonelementary particle has never been demonstrated experimentally. We present vortex beams of atoms and molecules, formed by diffracting supersonic beams of helium atoms and dimers off transmission gratings. This method is general and could be applied to most atomic and molecular gases. Our results may open new frontiers in atomic physics, using the additional degree of freedom of OAM to probe collisions and alter fundamental interactions."

Theory predicts that fusion could be interrupted earlier by merging of the star with a compact binary companion. We report a luminous radio transient, VT J121001+495647, found in the Very Large Array Sky Survey. The radio emission is consistent with supernova ejecta colliding with a dense shell of material, potentially ejected by binary interaction in the centuries before explosion. We associate the supernova with an archival x-ray transient, which implies that a relativistic jet was launched during the explosion. The combination of an early relativistic jet and late-time dense interaction is consistent with expectations for a merger-driven explosion."
https://openalex.org/W3197454148,"The first reaction of the methanogenic pathway from carbon dioxide (CO2) is the reduction and condensation of CO2 to formyl-methanofuran, catalyzed by formyl-methanofuran dehydrogenase (Fmd). Strongly reducing electrons for this reaction are generated by heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr) in complex with hydrogenase or formate dehydrogenase (Fdh) using a flavin-based electron-bifurcation mechanism. Here, we report enzymological and structural characterizations of Fdh-Hdr-Fmd complexes from Methanospirillum hungatei. The complexes catalyze this reaction using electrons from formate and the reduced form of the electron carrier F420. Conformational changes in HdrA mediate electron bifurcation, and polyferredoxin FmdF directly transfers electrons to the CO2 reduction site, as evidenced by methanofuran-dependent flavin-based electron bifurcation even without free ferredoxin, a diffusible electron carrier between Hdr and Fmd. Conservation of Hdr and Fmd structures suggests that this complex is common among hydrogenotrophic methanogens."
https://openalex.org/W3198427464,"The strongest supercell thunderstorms typically feature an above-anvil cirrus plume (AACP), which is a plume of ice and water vapor in the lower stratosphere that occurs downwind of the ambient stratospheric flow in the lee of overshooting deep convection. AACP-origin hydration of the stratosphere has a poorly constrained role in ozone destruction and surface warming. In this study, we use large eddy simulations corroborated by radar observations to understand the physics of AACP generation. We show that the overshooting top of a simulated supercell can act as a topographic obstacle and drive a hydraulic jump downstream at the tropopause, similar to a windstorm moving down the slope of a mountain but without solid topography. Once the jump is established, water vapor injection deep into the stratosphere may exceed 7 tonnes per second."
https://openalex.org/W3201592699,"Background Breast cancer (BCa) is a leading cause of mortality among women in Bangladesh. Many young women in Bangladesh have poor knowledge about breast cancer screening, including risk factors, warning signs/symptoms, diagnosis and early detection. We investigated awareness about breast cancer risk factors as a screening tool among women at the Sheikh Hasina Medical College (SHMC) of Tangail district in Bangladesh. Methods A cross sectional survey was conducted to collect data via a structured questionnaire from SHMC during the period of February to December 2019. A total of 1,007 participants (aged 33.47 (±12.37 years)) was considered for data analysis. Results Of the 1,007 women, about 50% were knowledgeable about the risk factors. Pain in the breast was identified as the most commonly warning sign/symptom of breast cancer. Only 32.2% of respondents knew at least one breast cancer screening method. The mean knowledge was scored 3.43 ± 2.25 out of a total possible score of 8. Awareness of BCa was associated with residence, family history of breast cancer, marital, literacy and socio-economic status ( p &lt;0.05). Only 14.7% of women who knew about BSE said they were conducting regular breast self-examination. Unmarried women (aOR: 2.971; 95% CI: 1.108–7.968) were more likely to have performed BSE compared to married women ( p &lt;0.05). Conclusion Although most participants were aware of breast cancer; knowledge about risk factors, warning signs/symptoms, early diagnosis and detection was relatively poor. Knowledge about performing BSE was particularly low. This highlights the importance of increasing awareness about breast cancer risk factors and early detection among young women in Bangladesh."

We use neutron pendell\""{o}sung interferometry to make precision measurements of the (220) and (400) neutron-silicon structure factors, and achieve a factor of four improvement in the (111) structure factor uncertainty. These data provide measurements of the silicon Debye-Waller factor at room temperature and the mean square neutron charge radius $\langle r_n^2 \rangle = -0.1101 \pm 0.0089 \, \mathrm{fm}^2$.

We use linear dichroism (LD) in a low-temperature laser–photoemission electron microscope to map out the nematic order parameter of nonmagentic FeSe and antiferromagnetic BaFe2(As0.87P0.13)2. In contrast to structural domains, which have atomic-scale domain walls, the LD patterns in both materials show peculiar sinusoidal waves of electronic nematicity with wavelengths more than 1000 times as long as the unit cell. Our findings put strong constraints on the theoretical investigation of electronic nematicity."
https://openalex.org/W3196841452,"Understanding the mechanistic coupling of molecular oxygen reduction and proton pumping for adenosine triphosphate synthesis during cellular respiration is the primary goal of research on heme-copper oxidases—the terminal complex in the membrane-bound electron transport chain. Cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond by the heme-copper oxidases forms the key intermediate PM, which initiates proton pumping. This intermediate is now experimentally defined by variable-temperature, variable-field magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy on a previously unobserved excited state feature associated with its heme iron(IV)-oxo center. These data provide evidence that the iron(IV)-oxo in PM is magnetically coupled to both a copper(II) and a cross-linked tyrosyl radical in the active site. These results provide new insight into the oxygen-oxygen bond cleavage and proton-pumping mechanisms of heme-copper oxidases."
https://openalex.org/W3200359767,"Lignin is nature’s largest source of phenolic compounds. Its recalcitrance to enzymatic conversion is still a limiting step to increase the value of lignin. Although bacteria are able to degrade lignin in nature, most studies have focused on lignin degradation by fungi. To understand which bacteria are able to use lignin as the sole carbon source, natural selection over time was used to obtain enriched microbial consortia over a 12-week period. The source of microorganisms to establish these microbial consortia were commercial and backyard compost soils. Cultivation occurred at two different temperatures, 30°C and 37°C, in defined culture media containing either Kraft lignin or alkaline-extracted lignin as carbon source. iTag DNA sequencing of bacterial 16S rDNA gene was performed for each of the consortia at six timepoints (passages). The initial bacterial richness and diversity of backyard compost soil consortia was greater than that of commercial soil consortia, and both parameters decreased after the enrichment protocol, corroborating that selection was occurring. Bacterial consortia composition tended to stabilize from the fourth passage on. After the enrichment protocol, Firmicutes phylum bacteria were predominant when lignin extracted by alkaline method was used as a carbon source, whereas Proteobacteria were predominant when Kraft lignin was used. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity calculations at genus level, visualized using NMDS plots, showed that the type of lignin used as a carbon source contributed more to differentiate the bacterial consortia than the variable temperature. The main known bacterial genera selected to use lignin as a carbon source were Altererythrobacter , Aminobacter , Bacillus , Burkholderia , Lysinibacillus , Microvirga , Mycobacterium , Ochrobactrum , Paenibacillus , Pseudomonas , Pseudoxanthomonas , Rhizobiales and Sphingobium . These selected bacterial genera can be of particular interest for studying lignin degradation and utilization, as well as for lignin-related biotechnology applications."

The study employs the theory of planned behaviour and two environmental factors to explore whether the theory’s behavioural factors and the contextual factors of Lüthje &amp; Franke’s model have an impact on students’ intentions to start their own business. A questionnaire survey with a random sample of 335 final-year university students from the largest public university in Yemen has been conducted. Data has been analysed using descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation and structural equation modelling. The findings indicate that students’ perceptions of entrepreneurship have a strong, direct impact on self-employment intention, excluding social norms and entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Students’ self-employment intention is directly affected by perceived barriers and support factors in the entrepreneurship-related context. To increase their entrepreneurial abilities, university students require more training and education to be able to start new businesses. Developing entrepreneurial skills among citizens may improve the societal norms of business.

However, evidence on the underlying mechanisms and the optimal verbalization instruction during ME is lacking. Therefore, this experimental study analyzed mechanisms of ME and therapeutic outcomes by comparing positive (PV) and negative (NV) full-body verbalization. N = 73 healthy females were randomized to a PV or an NV condition. PV participants verbalized positively while NV participants verbalized negatively about their whole body. Each participant underwent three standardized ME sessions. Before and after each ME session, positive affect, negative affect and body satisfaction were assessed. Before the first and after the third ME, participants completed questionnaires on cognitive-affective and behavioral aspects of body image, eating pathology and self-esteem. Regarding within-ME changes, the results indicate that positive affect and body satisfaction decreased while negative affect increased in the NV group but not in the PV group. In contrast, regarding between-ME changes, decreased negative affect as well as positive affect and increased body satisfaction were observed in both groups. However, eating pathology remained stable, whereas body-checking behavior increased and the PV condition was followed by higher levels of self-esteem compared to the NV condition. These findings suggest that both PV and NV improve negative affect and body satisfaction between-ME, and thus seem to be effective ME instructions. Given that NV led to increased negative affect within-ME and did not influence self-esteem, PV might represent the favorable instruction during ME for body-satisfied women."

https://openalex.org/W3200388134,"This study investigated the effect of apela on renal function and anti-inflammatory effect on whole body and kidney tissue in mice with type I cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The murine type I CRS model was established and apela was subcutaneously infused for two weeks. Cardiac and renal functions were evaluated by echocardiography and blood biochemistry, respectively. The systemic and renal inflammatory responses were examined with molecular biological and histological methods. Human renal glomerular endothelial cells (RGECs) were used to evaluate the adhesion effect of monocytes in vitro. Compared to mice from the control group (CRS + vehicle), the plasma levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were significantly decreased, while the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was increased in apela-treated CRS mice at the 4th week. The expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the circulation and kidney was decreased in apela-treated mice compared with control mice, and apela improved cardio-renal pathology in mice with type I CRS. Additionally, Apela significantly suppressed the expression of MCP-1, TNF-α, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in RGECs induced by angiotensin II (Ang II), and inhibited the promoting effect of Ang II on the adhesion of THP-1 cells to RGECs. Western blot results showed that the expression of phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa B (phospho-NFκB) in CRS mice was increased, but the expression of phospho-NFκB was down-regulated after apela treatment. Furthermore, apela significantly inhibited the Ang II-mediated increase in phospho-NFκB expression in RGECs in vitro, but the administration of an apelin peptide jejunum receptor (APJ) inhibitor blocked the inhibitory effect of apela. This study revealed that apela improves cardiorenal function and reduces systemic and renal inflammatory response in type I CRS mice and the apela/APJ system may alleviate renal inflammatory responses by inhibiting the NFκB signalling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3201133550,"There are several mathematical models and measurements to determine the efficiency of the digestibility of different feedstuffs. However, there is lack of information regarding the direct methods or measurement techniques used to analyse the physical response of the different parts of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of growing pigs to different diets. Smooth muscle electromyography (SMEMG) is a non-invasive method for the measurement of gastrointestinal myoelectrical activity. In the present study, SMEMG methodology has been adapted from laboratory rats to pigs, and the effects of feedstuffs with control (CTR) or experimentally increased (EXP) amounts of fibre were investigated on gastrointestinal tract motility. Nine barrow pigs ((Danish Landrace × Danish Yorkshire) × Danish Duroc) were used (30 ± 3 kg), and their CTR and EXP feedstuffs contained 29 and 49 g/kg crude fibre (CF), respectively. Myoelectric activities of the stomach, ileum and caecum were detected in the awake pigs by a pair of electrodes. The recorded myoelectric signals were analysed with fast Fourier transformation (FFT), and the spectra were expressed in GIT section-specific cycles per minutes (cpm) values and the maximum power spectrum density (PsD max ). A significant increase ( P &lt; 0.001) was observed in the value of the PsD max of the small intestine (20–25 cpm) as a consequence of the EXP diet. The PsDmax values of the stomach (3–5 cpm) and large intestine (1–3 cpm) did not show any significant change in pigs fed the EXP diet. As a direct and non-invasive method, SMEMG is suitable for the rapid evaluation of the effects of diets with different fibre contents on the GIT of non-anaesthetised, free-moving pigs."

This study investigated the prevalence of the five neonatal screening tests and its associated institutional and socio-cultural factors using a cross-sectional study with 415 mother and baby binomials from public maternity hospitals in Natal, RN, Brazil in 2019. Pearson’s chi-squared, Mann-Whitney and Poisson regression tests were used, with a significance of p ≤ 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval. The sample loss was 71 mothers (17%). The prevalence in the first week and at the end of 28 days was 93% and 99.5% (pulse oximetry screening), 60% and 97.6% (red reflex examination), 71.9% and 93.6% (Guthrie test), 35.5% and 68.2% (hearing screening test), and 19% and 48.9% (tongue test). Only 152 newborns (36.6%) underwent all five tests.

https://openalex.org/W3199570120,"The benefits of increased human lifespan depend upon duration of healthy, independent living; the healthspan. Bone-wasting disorders contribute significantly to loss of independence, frailty, and morbidity in older people. Therefore, there is an unmet need globally for lifestyle interventions to reduce the likelihood of bone fractures with age. Although many mechanisms are involved in disorders of bone loss, there is no single regulatory pathway and, therefore, there is no single treatment available to prevent their occurrence. Our aim in these studies was to determine whether fasting/feeding interventions alter the effect of mechanical loading on bone anabolic activities and increase bone mass. In young 17-week-old mice, 16-hour fasting period followed by reintroduction of food for 2 hours increased markedly the potency of mechanical loading, that mimics the effect of exercise, to induce new cortical bone formation. Consistent with this finding, fasting and re-feeding increased the response of bone to a loading stimulus that, alone, does not stimulate new bone formation in ad-lib fed mice. Older mice (20 months) experienced no potentiation of loading-induced bone formation with the same timing of feeding interventions. Interestingly, the pre-, prandial, and postprandial endocrine responses in older mice were different from those in young animals. The hormones that change in response to timing of feeding have osteogenic effects that interact with loading-mediated effects. Our findings indicate associations between timing of food ingestion and bone adaptation to loading. If translated to humans, such non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions may benefit skeletal health of humans throughout life-course and in older age."

https://openalex.org/W3200468233,"Herein, we assessed whether hepatobiliary phase (HBP) signal intensity (SI) can be used to differentiate HCC and non-HCC malignancies within LR-M observations. 106 LR-M patients based on LI-RADS v2018 who underwent gadoxetate-disodium magnetic resonance imaging and surgery from January 2009 to December 2018 were included. SI of LR-M observation on HBP was analyzed by two radiologists and categorized into dark, low and iso-to-high groups. Tumor was classified as dark when more than 50% of tumor showed hypointensity compared to spleen, as low when more than 50% of tumor showed hyperintensity compared to spleen but hypointensity compared to liver parenchyma, and as iso-to-high if there was even a focal iso-intensity or hyperintensity compared to liver parenchyma. Analysis of clinicopathological factors and association between imaging and histology was performed. Out of 106 LR-M, 42 (40%) were showed dark, 61 (58%) showed low, and 3 (3%) showed iso-to-high SI in HBP. Three iso-to-high SI LR-M were HCCs ( P = 0.060) and their major histologic differentiation was Edmondson grade 1 ( P = 0.001). 43 out of 61 (71%) low SI LR-M were iCCA or cHCC-CCA ( P = 0.002). Inter-reader agreement of HBP SI classification was excellent, with a kappa coefficient of 0.872. LR-M with iso-to-high SI in HBP is prone to being HCC while LR-M with low SI in HBP is prone to being tumor with fibrous stroma such as iCCA and cHCC-CCA. Classification of LR-M based on HBP SI may be a helpful method of differentiating HCC from non-HCC malignancies."

https://openalex.org/W3201264079,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes. Epidemiological studies have reported that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and a high hemoglobin (Hb) concentration are risk factors for GDM in the middle trimester. However, no consistent conclusions have been reached, especially in Chinese pregnant women. A case-control study was conducted to better understand the associations between NAFLD and Hb concentration in the first trimester and the risk of GDM and their interactive effects. Multivariable logistic regression analysis and a cross-product term of Hb and steatosis were used to evaluate the associations between first trimester Hb concentration, steatosis, and GDM and their interactive effects. Odds ratios (OR s ) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using two-sided statistical tests at an alpha level of 0.05. For the study, 1,017 normal pregnant women, and 343 pregnant women diagnosed with GDM (25.22%) were recruited from the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Province, China. NAFLD-associated steatosis was found to be independent risk factors for developing GDM compared with grade 0 steatosis, with ORs of 1.98 (95% CI: 1.35–2.89) and 2.27 (95% CI:1.29–3.96), respectively. Meanwhile, a high Hb concentration was found to be a risk factor for developing GDM compared with the normal Hb concentration (OR = 1.88; 95% CI:1.24–2.83). The risk of developing GDM was more pronounced among pregnant women who had both high-grade steatosis and higher Hb concentrations during their first trimester (OR = 6.24; 95% CI : 1.81–23.66). However, we found no significant interactions between Hb concentration and steatosis grade. In conclusion, our study confirmed that a high Hb concentration and NAFLD-associated steatosis during the first trimester play important roles in predicting the risk of GDM in Chinese women. Future studies are required to verify the interactive effects between NAFLD-associated steatosis and Hb concentration."

https://openalex.org/W3199600167,"Individuals with a laryngectomy face a host of challenges ranging from restricted vocal communication to significant lifestyle modifications associated with breathing through a stoma. Although there are significant mental and physical health benefits achieved by returning to recreational pursuits that were enjoyed pre-surgery, there can be significant obstacles in doing so. One particular challenge arises during participation in water activities (e.g, fishing, boating, etc.) where accidental submersion poses a significant risk of drowning. This manuscript describes a proof-of-concept device that protects the airway from accidental incursion of water into the airway during unanticipated submersion in water, thereby allowing laryngectomees to return to participation in water activities. The device is designed to be worn comfortably for long periods of time, while not interfering with the common methods of replacement speech that are utilized post-laryngectomy."
