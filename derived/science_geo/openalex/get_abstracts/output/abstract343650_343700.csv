https://openalex.org/W2067579175,"Clay samples from three Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary sites contain 0.36 to 0.58 percent graphitic carbon, mainly as fluffy aggregates of 0.1 to 0.5 micrometers-apparently a worldwide layer of soot. It may have been produced by wildfires triggered by a giant meteorite. This carbon, corresponding to a global abundance of 0.021 +/- 0.006 gram per square centimeter, could have greatly enhanced the darkening and cooling of the earth by rock dust, which has been suggested as a cause of the extinctions. The surprisingly large amount of soot (10 percent of the present biomass of the earth) implies either that much of the earth's vegetation burned down or that substantial amounts of fossil fuels were ignited also. The particle-size distribution of the soot is similar to that assumed for the smoke cloud of ""nuclear winter,"" but the global distribution is more uniform and the amounts are much greater, suggesting that soot production by large wildfires is about 10 times more efficient that has been assumed for a nuclear winter. Thus cooling would be more pervasive and lasting. No trace of meteoritic noble gases and no meteoritic spinel were found in these carbon fractions. Accordingly, limits can be set on the mass fraction of the meteorite that escaped degassing (</=3 x 10(-5)) or vaporization (</=0.04). Thus it seems unlikely that comets contributed significant amounts of prebiotic organic matter to the primitive earth."

At temperatures above 60 degrees C, only bacteria are found. Bacteria with temperature optima over the range 65 degrees to 105 degrees C have been obtained in pure culture and are the object of many research projects. The upper temperature limit for life in liquid water has not yet been defined, but is likely to be somewhere between 110 degrees and 200 degrees C, since amino acids and nucleotides are destroyed at temperatures over 200 degrees C. Because bacteria capable of growth at high temperatures are found in many phylogenetic groups, it is likely that the ability to grow at high temperature had a polyphyletic origin. The macromolecules of these organisms are inherently more stable to heat than those of conventional organisms, but only small changes in sequence can lead to increases in thermostability. Because of their unique properties, thermophilic organisms and their enzymes have many potential biotechnological uses, and extensive research on industrial applications is under way."

They are interpreted as dust devils, confirming predictions of their occurrence on Mars and giving evidence of a specific form of dust entrainment."
https://openalex.org/W1994797166,"A new metabolic pathway has been created in the microorganism Erwinia herbicola that gives it the ability to produce 2-keto-L-gulonic acid, an important intermediate in the synthesis of L-ascorbic acid. Initially, a Corynebacterium enzyme that could stereoselectively reduce 2,5-diketo-D-gluconic acid to 2-keto-L-gulonic acid was identified and purified. DNA probes based on amino acid sequence information from 2,5-diketo-D-gluconic acid reductase were then used to isolate the gene for this enzyme from a Corynebacterium genomic library. The 2,5-diketo-D-gluconic acid reductase coding region was fused to the Escherichia coli trp promoter and a synthetic ribosome binding site and was then introduced into E. herbicola on a multicopy plasmid. Erwinia herbicola naturally produces 2,5-diketo-D-gluconic acid via glucose oxidation, and when recombinant cells expressing the plasmid-encoded reductase were grown in the presence of glucose, 2-keto-L-gulonic acid was made and released into the culture medium. The data demonstrate the feasibility of creating novel in vivo routes for the synthesis of important specialty chemicals by combining useful metabolic traits from diverse sources in a single organism."

https://openalex.org/W2083177328,"Despite the dominant position of silicon in semiconductor electronics, its use is ultimately limited by its incompatibility with other semiconducting materials. Strained-layer epitaxy overcomes problems of crystallographic compatibility and produces high-quality heterostructures of germanium-silicon layers on silicon. This opens the door to a range of electronic and photonic devices that are based on bandstructure physics."
https://openalex.org/W2126952254,"Halite particles about 2 micrometers in size were collected by a quartz crystal microbalance cascade impactor from the El ChichÃ³n eruption cloud in the lower stratosphere during April and May 1982. These particles are probably derived from the erupted chloride-rich, alkalic magma. Enrichments of hydrogen chloride and increases in optical depolarization in the eruption cloud observed by lidar measurements may reflect the influence of the halite particles. There is evidence that the halite particles reacted with sulfuric acid after about 1 month, releasing gaseous hydrogen chloride, which can influence the catalytic destruction of ozone in the stratosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2043736652,"Numerous development projects aimed at replacing the silicon technology that dominates computer logic with a faster alternative have been conducted throughout the past 25 years. None has succeeded. The alternatives are usually based on a device that switches very rapidly, and they neglect many other requirements of computer logic. In this article the essential physical factors that account for the success of transistors in digital applications are identified, as are the factors that are absent in proposed alternative devices."

Directions of magnetization at three localities in the southern Sierra Nevada are progressively deflected; this is consistent with the hypothesis that the region was tectonically rotated in an orocline. No paleomagnetic deflection was observed northwest of the White Wolf-Kern Canyon fault system. Oroclinal bending ofa block bounded by the San Andreas, Garlock, and White Wolf-Kern Canyon faults may have occurred before about 16 x l0(6) years ago. The deformation may have been a response to shear at the western boundary of the North American plate caused by oblique subduction."

These findings, indicating synthesis of folic acid by the intestinal bacteria, are in accord with the findings of Mitchell and Isbell on synthesis of this substance by rat intestinal flora."

https://openalex.org/W2066597641,"After decades of struggling with the issue, Congress in late 1982 established a firm plan for burying growing volumes of nuclear reactor wastes. But 2 l/2 years later the waste disposal debate is as hot as ever. Utility companies, environmentalists, federal officials, and state governments are again clashing - this time over the way the program is proceeding. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act calls for the Department of Energy to start accepting wastes in 1998 at the first of two planned repositories. Selection of this first repository site was mandated for early 1987, but program delays at DOE have pushed the decision back to March 1991. Despite this postponement and other schedule slips, the Department still aims to meet Congress's 1998 deadline. But states, Indian tribes, and environmentalists fear the site selection process will be compromised and want the start up date rolled back."

https://openalex.org/W2018312951,"Britain's oil boom is fading. Production from oil reserves in the North Sea, which grew from 1.6 million tonnes in 1975 to 126 million tonnes last year, has now peaked and is expected to decline steadily for the rest of the century. Indeed, some time in the mid-1990s, Britain will once again become a net importer of oil, having been producing more than it consumes since the beginning of the 1980s. The impact on the British economy will be severe. Oil revenues contributed $16 billion to the government's income in 1985 through royalties and taxes paid by the companies that have been developing the North Sea reserves and are estimated to have added 0.5% to the increase in gross domestic product every year since the mid-1970s. However, some compensation is likely as a result of the search that has now begun for less accessible sources of oil. It is expected to generate its own benefits. One is the boost already being given to the development of more sophisticated exploration and extraction techniques."
