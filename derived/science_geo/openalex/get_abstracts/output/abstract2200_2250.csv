https://openalex.org/W1574834577,"Solubilization of heparan sulfate proteoglycans from a rat liver membrane fraction was obtained by the use of the charged detergent deoxycholate or alternatively a combination of NaCl and the nonionic detergent Triton-X 100. Subsequently, proteoglycans solubilized from microsomal and plasma membrane fractions, respectively, were purified by a procedure involving gel chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, and density gradient centrifugation. The purified heparan sulfate proteoglycan had a molecular weight of about 75,000 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis or gel chromatography. Molecular weights of 17,000 to 40,000 were obtained for the 125I-labeled core protein after removal of the heparan sulfate polysaccharide chains by different enzymatic and chemical methods. An average molecular weight of 14,000 was found for the polysaccharide chains released from the core protein by alkali treatment. The data are consistent with a proteoglycan structure containing four polysaccharide chains attached to the core protein. The amino acid composition of native and alkali-treated proteoglycan support the proposed proteoglycan model."

Of 103 clones examined, all had normal levels of steroid sulfatase activity. Two of the women studied were also heterozygous for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This allowed the demonstration that both X chromosomes were represented as the active X in various clones and that selection did not account for these findings. Thus, the steroid sulfatase locus, like the Xga locus to which it is linked, appears to escape X-inactivation in man."

The results provide further evidence for the identity of red blood cell activator and calmodulin and show that this cytoplasmic protein may participate in the regulation of plasma membrane calcium transport."

https://openalex.org/W1481250342,"The nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial DNA of a cytoplasmic petite mutant of Saccharomyces cer- evisiae is reported. The DNA has a repeat length of 1060 base pairs and contains a genetic marker (oli-i) for the ATPase pro- teolipid. The nucleotide sequence reveals the presence of part of the structural gene of the subunit-9 proteolipid of the ATPase complex and an extended A+T-rich region adjacent to the car- boxy -terminal end of the gene. The structural gene sequence agrees with the primary structure of the protein. These studies point out the feasibility of using the DNA of appropriately marked petite mutants to obtain the sequence of mitochon- drial genes. Mitochondrial DNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae codes for a limited number of proteins that are components of respiratory complexes and of the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase (1-6). Re- cent evidence suggests that the mitochondrial gene products correspond to the set of proteins translated within the organelle (6-8). In view of its relatively small size and the large number of currently known genetic markers, the mitochondrial genome of this yeast offers many advantages for DNA sequence stud- ies. In this communication, we report the nucleotide sequence of a segment of mitochondrial DNA obtained from a p- clone containing the oli-1 resistance locus (9). In other studies, the oli-i marker was localized in the structural gene of a subunit polypeptide of the mitochondrial ATPase complex (7). Our data indicate that the DNA of the p- clone includes part of the ATPase gene adjoined by an extended A+T-rich region."
https://openalex.org/W1503233261,"The plasma membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a Mg2+-dependent ATPase which is distinct from the mitochondrial Mg2+-ATPase and at the pH optimum of 5.5 has a Km for ATP of 1.7 mM and a Vmax of 0.42 mumol of ATP hydrolyzed/mg/min. At least three protein components of the crude membrane (Mr = 210,000, 160,000 and 115,000) are labeled with [gamma32P]ATP at pH 5.5. These phosphoproteins form rapidly in the presence of Mg2+, rapidly turn over the bound phosphate when unlabeled ATP is added, and dephosphorylate after incubation in the presence of hydroxylamine. Vanadate, an inhibitor of the Mg2+-ATPase activity, blocks the phosphorylation of the 210,000- and 115,000-dalton proteins. At pH 7.0, only the 210,000- and 160,000-dalton proteins are phosphorylated. While these three phosphorylated intermediates have not been unambiguously identified as components of the Mg2+-ATPase, the finding of such phosphorylated components in association with that activity implies that this enzyme differs in mechanism from the mitochondrial proton pump and that it is similar in mechanism to the metal ion pumps ((Na+-K+)-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase) of the mammalian plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1524188381,"Kinetic evidence of a time- and dose-dependent inactivation of phosphofructokinase by glucagon in isolated rat hepatocytes is reported. This inactivation, which persists after gel filtration of a cell-free extract on Sephadex G-25 and after 400-fold purification of the enzyme on agarose-ATP, is observed when the enzyme activity is measured at subsaturating concentrations of fructose 6-phosphate, while there is no change in Vmax. Phosphofructokinase inactivation by glucagon parallels the known inactivation of pyruvate kinase L and activation of glycogen phosphorylase alpha. Exogenous cyclic AMP mimics the effect of this hormone. Half-maximal effect for both phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase L is caused by a similar dose of glucagon (1 x 10(-10) M). The inactivation of phosphofructokinase by nonsaturating concentration of glucagon is reversed spontaneously within 40 min of incubation and this reversion is accelerated by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1574517022,"The various activities of the recBC enzyme of Escherichia coli are differentially sensitive to reaction conditions. Although spermidine up to 50 mM and putrescine up to 40 mM in the presence of Mg/sup 2 +/ produce no significant alteration in the activities of the enzyme, low concentrations of Ca/sup 2 +/ have a dramatic effect. In the presence of 1 mM Ca/sup 2 +/, 1 mM Mg/sup 2 +/, and 5 mM ATP, the DNA-dependent ATPase is unaffected, but the double strand DNA exonuclease and the single strand DNA exonuclease and endonuclease activities are completely inhibited. Duplex phage T7 DNA which has been exposed to enzyme under these conditions remains wholly duplex and full length, although about 5 nicks are made randomly in each duplex. When DNA binding protein from E. coli is included in the reaction with enzyme and DNA, the products are, at early stages of the reaction, duplex DNA molecules with one or two single-stranded tails at a terminus; after prolonged incubation, solely single-stranded fragments of 5000 to 35,000 nucleotides are found. (Full length strands are roughly 40,000 nucleotides long.) These products can be rationalized by a model in which the enzyme binds initially to the terminusmore » of a duplex DNA molecule and then tracks along the DNA, unwinding the strands of the helix as it moves. This denaturation would be transient and localized around the enzyme molecule so that the DNA would renature after the enzyme has passed through a particular region. However, the renaturation can be prevented by the presence of DNA binding protein during the reaction. During the passage of an enzyme molecule through a DNA molecule, a limited number of nicks are randomly introduced in a manner essentially unaffected by binding protein. This mode of action is distinct from that observed for the degradation of duplex DNA with Mg/sup 2 +/ but not Ca/sup 2 +/ present.« less"
https://openalex.org/W2268923127,"Through analysis of cloned fragments of N. crassa mitochondrial DNA, we have derived a physical map for the region of the mitochondrial genome which encodes the ribosomal RNAs and most of the tRNAs. We have located RNA genes on this map by hybridization of purified 32P end-labeled RNA probes, and our findings are as follows. First, the gene for the large ribosomal RNA contains an intervening sequence of approximately 2000 bp. Second, the genes for the small and large ribosomal RNAs are not adjacent, as previously reported, and the region between them contains a number of tRNA genes, including that for the mitochondrial tRNATyr, which is located close to the small rRNA gene on the same strand of the mitochondrial DNA. Third, there is a second cluster of tRNA genes on the mitochondrial DNA following the large ribosomal RNA gene, but there is no evidence for the presence of tRNA genes in the intervening sequence of the large ribosomal RNA. Fourth, hybridization of labeled ribosomal and transfer RNAs to the separated strands of a cloned 16 kbp DNA fragment covering this region indicates that the two ribosomal RNAs and most, if not all, of the mitochondrial tRNAs are encoded on one strand of the mitochondrial DNA."

This myosin could be phosphorylated by an endogenous myosin light chain kinase, up to 2 mol of phosphate being incorporated/mol of myosin. The site phosphorylated was located on the 20,000-dalton myosin light chain. Phosphorylation of macrophage myosin was found to be necessary for actin activation of myosin ATPase activity. Moreover, the actin-activated ATPase activity was found to vary directly with the extent of myosin phosphorylation, maximal phosphorylation (2 mol of Pi/mol of myosin) resulting in an actin-activated MgATPase activity of approximately 200 nmol of Pi/mg of myosin/min at 37 degrees C. These results establish that phosphyoyration of the 20,000-dalton light chain of myosin is sufficient to regulate the actin-activated ATPase activity of macrophage myosin."

https://openalex.org/W1972575544,"Removal of fibrinopeptide B from human fibrinogen by reaction with the procoagulant enzyme from copperhead snake venom below 25 degrees C resulted in tight aggregation of the fibrinogen, which, in turn, progressively blocked a concomitant but sluggish release of fibrinopeptide A by the enzyme. When the clots obtained at less than 25 degrees C were warmed, they dissociated into soluble aggregates and monomers. Release of fibrinopeptide A then resumed, and a secondary coagulation followed. The aggregation induced by release of fibrinopeptide B itself involves a plasmin-susceptible segment located just distal to B in the B beta chain of fibrinogen, a segment previously shown to be of little importance in the aggregation induced by release of fibrinopeptide A."
https://openalex.org/W1602420438,"The steady state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis by partially purified adenosine triphosphatase preparations of sarcoplasmic reticulum was investigated at 0 degrees C and pH 7.0 in 2.0 mM MgCl2, 20 microM [gamma-32P]ATP, 20 microM CaCl2, and various concentrations of KCl in the presence and absence of 12% dimethyl sulfoxide. The steady state phosphoenzyme formed under these conditions could be resolved kinetically into ADP-sensitive and ADP-insensitive forms. These steady state kinetic data were analyzed according to a scheme in which the ADP-sensitive and ADP-insensitive phosphoenzymes occur sequentially, and Pi is derived from the latter. The KCl-dependent turnover rate of the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme that was estimated according to this scheme was in good agreement with the directly measured hydrolysis rate constant of the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme. In addition, the time course of the decomposition of the total amount of phosphoenzyme, measured after a steady state level was reached in 20 mM KCl and further phosphorylation was prevented by addition of excess ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, was also in agreement with that calculated according to this scheme using values of the rate constants estimated from the amounts of the ADP-sensitive and ADP-insensitive phosphoenzymes and the rate of ATP hydrolysis. These results, together with our previous findings, support the view that this scheme describes the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of KCl."
https://openalex.org/W1602949099,"Analyses of the binding of tropomyosin to muscle and Acanthamoeba actin by the use of Scatchard plots indicate that the binding exhibits strong positive cooperativity in the presence of Mg2+. The cooperative nature of the binding is not affected by the presence of 80 mm KCl, but appears to decrease somewhat in the presence of heavy meromyosin or subfragment-1. Heavy meromyosin, subfragment-1, and KCl each increase the binding affinity of actin for tropomyosin; depending on the experimental condition and the type of actin involved, the apparent binding constant, Kapp, is in the range of 1 to 4 x 10(6) M-1. Muscle actin cross-linked with glutaraldehyde failed to bind tropomyosin even when heavy meromyosin, subfragment-1, or KCl were added as inducers, although the cross-linked actin still markedly activated the heavy meromyosin ATPase."

This fragment was isolated from uncloned mitochondrial DNA and further analyzed by cleavage with restriction endonucleases Hind II, Hind III, Bam HI, Pvu II and BgI I, and by electron microscopy of rRNA/DNA hybrids. The resulting map shows a 2.3 kb intervening sequence interrupting the gene for 24S rRNA. The main part (2.7 kb) of this gene is separated from the 17S rRNA gene by a 5 kb segment which contains several transfer RNA genes. This segment is much longer than the putative 1 kb spacer sequence within the 32S precursor molecule for both rRNAs, suggesting a second splicing event in that region."

https://openalex.org/W1479859086,"Proteolysis of human cross-linked fibrin by plasmin results in the formation of a DD . E complex, and Fragments DD and E as the major degradation products. Three species of Fragment E, which differ both in molecular weights (E1, Mr = 60,000; E2, Mr = 55,000; E3, Mr = 50,000) and in charge, have been isolated from a digest of cross-linked fibrin. Each Fragment E species reacts with monospecific anti-E antiserum. Fragments E1 and E2 bind with Fragment DD to form a DD . E complex but Fragment E3 is inactive. This binding is specific since these Fragments E do not bind to fibrinogen or to degradation products of fibrinogen or of noncross-linked fibrin. Fragments E1 and E2 incubated with plasmin are degraded to Fragment E3, suggesting that the three species represent sequential degradation products. Plasmin-treated Fragments E1 and E2 no longer bind with Fragment DD; therefore, it appears that the peptides cleaved from Fragment E2 by plasmin contain or modify the sites responsible for complex formation. On the other hand, Fragment DD binds not only to Fragments E1 and E2, but also to fibrinogen, Fragments X (Stage 1), X (Stage 2), Y, and NH2-terminal disulfide knot, but only after thrombin treatment, suggesting that Fragment DD binds to complementary sites on the NH2-terminal region of fibrinogen which are exposed after thrombin treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1558199466,"In the present study, the question of whether the two myosin active sites are identical with respect to ATP binding and hydrolysis was reinvestigated. The stoichiometry of ATP binding to myosin, heavy meromyosin, and subfragment-1 was determined by measuring the fluorescence enhancement caused by the binding of MgATP. The amount of irreversible ATP binding and the magnitude of the initial ATP hydrolysis (initial Pi burst) was determined by measuring [gamma-32P]ATP hydrolysis with and without a cold ATP chase in a three-syringe quenched flow apparatus. The results show that, under a wide variety of experimental conditions: 1) the stoichiometry of ATP binding ranges from 0.8 to 1 mol of ATP/myosin active site for myosin, heavy meromyosin, and subfragment-1, 2) 80 to 100% of this ATP binding is irreversible, 3) 70 to 90% of the irreversibly bound ATP is hydrolyzed in the initial Pi burst, 4) the first order rate constant for the rate-limiting step in ATP hydrolysis by heavy meromyosin is equal to the steady state heavy meromyosin ATPase rate only if the latter is calculated on the basis of two active sites per heavy meromyosin molecule. It is concluded that the two active sites of myosin are identical with respect to ATP binding and hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1567088256,"A 20-residue peptide analog of the actomyosin ATPase inhibitory region of rabbit skeletal troponin I (Tn-I) has been synthesized by the solid phase method. The analog exhibited biological activity similar to both Tn-I and a 21-residue cyanogen bromide fragment of Tn-I. At ionic strengths where the inhibition of the actomyosin ATPase due to tropomyosin alone is low, the synthetic peptide in the presence of tropomyosin inhibits 90% of the original ATPase activity. In the absence of tropomyosin, the inhibition due to the peptide is much reduced. In contrast, salmine, a basic protein also known to inhibit the actomyosin ATPase, shows less inhibition in the presence of tropomyosin than it does in its absence. Gel electrophoresis data showed that the enhancement of the analog's inhibition by tropomyosin may be related to the analog's promotion of tropomyosin binding to F-actin similar to that reported for Tn-I and that the reduction of salmine inhibition by tropomyosin may be due to the binding of salmine by tropomyosin. At ionic strengths where binding and inhibition of tropomyosin is significant, the analog enhanced inhibition in a manner similar to that reported for whole Tn-I."

https://openalex.org/W160582356,"A major question about the mechanism of the myosin ATPase is how much of the fluorescence change which accompanies the binding of ATP to myosin is due to the conformational change induced by ATP and how much is due to the subsequent hydrolysis of ATP in the initial Pi burst. Several laboratories have suggested that the maximal rate of the fluorescence change represents the rate of the irreversible conformational change induced by ATP. In the present study, the rate of irreversible ATP binding, the rate of the initial Pi burst, and the rate of the fluorescence enhancement were compared under varied conditions. The results show that: 1) the fluorescence enhancement is mainly due to the hydrolysis of ATP in the initial Pi burst rather than to the conformational change induced by the binding of ATP; 2) the rate of the initial Pi burst is considerably slower than the rate of irreversible ATP binding at high ATP concentration; 3) the rate of the initial Pi burst is almost the same as the rate of the fluorescence enhancement. Therefore, the maximum rate of the fluorescence enhancement represents the rate of the initial Pi burst rather than the rate of the conformational change induced by ATP binding."
https://openalex.org/W34803841,"Bidirectional fluxes, net transport, and cellular metabolic profiles following incubation of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells for short intervals with [3H]fluorodeoxyuridine were examined to characterize the relationship between transport and metabolism of this nucleoside. This approach indicates that the uptake sequence of 3H is characterized by (i) a very rapid initial uptake phase that is linear with time, extrapolates through the point of origin, and represents the initial rate of fluorodeoxyuridine transport into the cell. This is followed by (ii) a fall in the net rate of 3H uptake due to the contribution of an efflux component for fluorodeoxyuridine and, to some extent, fluorouracil as the nucleoside and base accumulate within the cell. As these exit components increase, cellular fluorodeoxyuridine reaches a steady state within 15 s. (iii) At this point, net uptake of 3H has declined to a velocity which remains constant for at least the next 100 s and reflects almost entirely the rate of cellular accumulation and retention of fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate. Over this interval of observation and under these experimental conditions, only fluorodeoxyuridine, fluorouracil, and fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate are detected within the cell. Low concentrations of thymidine (10 pM) block the late linear uptake phase for 3H, but have only a small effect on the initial uptake velocity. The effect of thymidine on the late linear phase is due primarily to a marked inhibition of the metabolism of fluorodeoxyuridine to fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate rather than an inhibition of fluorodeoxyuridine transport. When cells are first loaded with high levels of nonlabeled fluorodeoxyuridine (10 mM) and then pulsed with [3H]fluorodeoxyuridine, there is a trans-stimulation of [3H]fluorodeoxyuridine influx and a transient increase in the steady state fluorodeoxyuridine level within the cell (countertransport), both characteristics of a carrier-mediated process. Efflux studies confirm that this enhanced uptake of [3H]fluorodeoxyuridine is related to a rapidly exchangeable component which appears to be free in the intracellular water. These observations (i) point to the critical role of experimental design and data analysis in the study of membrane transport properties of nucleosides or other compounds that are rapidly metabolized within cells, and (ii) demonstrate the evanescent nature of trans-"

The results indicate that: (a) the binding of ATP to Subfragment 1 is exothermic (AH = -90 kJ mol-‘, all the AH values are corrected for protonation heat of Tris). (b) The actual cleavage of ATP on Subfragment 1 is endothermic (AH = +83 kJ mol-I), which contrasts to the situation in free solution where ATP hydrolysis is exothermic, AH = -23 kJ mol-‘. Thus binding and cleavage together, which form the myosin+product complex at a rate which greatly exceeds the rate of decay of the complex (Pi release), is marginally exothermic (AH = -7 kJ mol-‘). (c) The slow Pi release is strongly exothermic (AH = -88 kJ mol-‘), as previously suggested by Yamada et al. (Yamada, T., Shimizu, H., and Suga, H. (1973) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 305, 643-653). (d) The dissociation of ADP from Subfragment 1 is endothermic (AH = +72 kJ mol-‘), being consistent with our recent result on the ADP binding to Subfragment 1 and heavy meromyosin (Kodama, T., Watson, I. D., and Woledge, R. C. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252,8085-8087). Thus in the myosin-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP large enthalpy changes, as compared with the enthalpy change for the overall reaction, accompany several intermediate steps of the enzyme catalytic cycle.

In the absence of light the ATP analogue has been found to be a substrate for the E132PA1P1-ATP exchange reaction of submitochondrial particles. When photoirradiated in the presence of arylazido-beta-alanyl-ATP, the ATPase activity and the the the [32P]Pi-ATP exchange reaction are inhibited maximally 80%. Arylazido-beta-alanyl-ATP following photolysis is a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to ATP while arylazido-beta-alanine, the azido-containing adjunct of the ATP analogue, has no inhibitory effect under the same conditions. The inactivating effect of arylazido-beta-alanyl-ATP is prevented in part by the presence of ATP, or ADP and pyrophosphate. Photolabeling produces a covalent binding of the derivative with the F1ATPase being the major protein labeled. The binding of 0.22 mumol of arylazido-beta-alanyl-ATP/mg of mitochondrial protein is associated with a maximal inhibitory effect. The ATPase activity of the partially purified ATPase complex is also sensitive to photoirradiation in the presence of arylazido-beta-alanyl-ATP. When the ATPase complex is associated with liposomes there is an increase in the specific ATPase activity with a 10-fold increase in Vmax and a 4-fold decrease in KmATP associated with a parallel increase in the apparent affinity and maximal inhibitory effect of the arylazido-beta-alanyl-ATP. The photoinhibition of the ATPase complex in the presence of arylazido-beta-alanyl-ATP results in covalent binding of 1.6 mumol of arylazido-beta-alanyl-ATP/mg of protein. The alpha and beta subunits are the only components of the ATPase complex labeled by the [3H]arylazido-beta-alanyl-ATP. The relationship between the arylazido-beta-alanyl-ATP-labeled sites and the nucleotide binding sites on the mitochondrial ATPase is discussed."

From small angle x-ray scattering measurements the radius of gyration, the specific inner surface area, and the volume were determined for both enzyme forms, revealing that the octameric cross-linked form is approximately spherical, with a diameter of 120.0 A, whereas the tetrameric form is asymmetric having an axial ratio of 2. By comparison of the scattering curves with triaxial geometric bodies which are equivalent in scattering, the tetrameric enzyme is described as a rectangular prism, with overall dimensions of A = 131.0 A, B = 131.0 A, and C = 65.0 A, and the octameric form as that of a cube with A = B = C = 120.0 A.

From the different shapes of the scattering curves of the native phosphofructokinase at pH 7.5 in the presence of 15 mM ATP and of the cross-linked tetramer or octamer, it can be inferred that the shapes of the protomers are different: in the presence of ATP the protomers are elongated, having an axial ratio of 1.8 to 2.0; the cross-linked state reveals a spherical protomer of radius 33.0 A, similar to that of the native enzyme at pH 7.5 in the presence of fructose 6-phosphate or fructose 1,6-bisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2035729548,"REGULATION of skeletal muscle contraction by calcium ions is mediated by the troponin–tropomyosin system located in the groove of actin double strands1. Acting with tropomyosin, troponin depresses the ability of the actin filament to interact with the myosin molecule in the presence of ATP. Some structural changes in the thin filament associated with this depression have been detected by physical techniques2–8. When the actin filament is cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, it retains the ability to activate myosin ATPase9, and troponin and tropomyosin can no longer exert their regulatory effect on these cross-linked or ‘frozen’ actin filaments10. Using glutaraldehyde as cross-linking agent we have now been able to ‘freeze’ the activated (presence of calcium) and depressed (absence) states of the actin filament induced by the troponin–tropomyosin system: this suggests that the structural changes detected using physical methods are essential for regulation by calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1586231069,"In exponentially growing cultures of Neurospora crassa, the basal rate of protein degradation increases as the constant of the rate of growth decreases, so that in slow growing cells (mu = 0.13) the rate of protein degradation is about 25% of the rate of protein accumulation. During glucose starvation and shift-down transition of growth, the rate of protein degradation is greatly enhanced, and a moderate reduction (about 30%) of the ATP level is observed. Treatment of glucose-starved cells with 2-deoxyglucose reduces the ATP content by 70% and blocks protein degradation. The addition of cycloheximide, given at the onset of glucose starvation, prevents the enhancement of protein degradation; instead cycloheximide is without effect if added when proteolysis has already started. At a supraoptimal temperature (42 degrees C) the basal rate of protein degradation is not stimulated, contrary to the behavior observed in bacteria. Guanosine nucleotides, which appear to have a regulatory role for protein degradation in bacteria, are not found in N. crassa."

The nuclei isolated from the cells immediately after release from thymidine synchronization exhibited a significantly increased activity of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Thereafter, the fluctuation pattern of the activity of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in isolated nuclei during the cell cycle was essentially the same as in the case of hydroxyurea synchronization. The activity of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in isolated nuclei after treatment with thymidine in vivo increased with the treatment time. The time-dependent increase was also evident in the case of nicotinamide treatment. Little increase in the activity was observed in hydroxyurea and amethopterin treatment. When poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was extracted from the nuclei isolated from the cells which were pretreated with each of the four compounds, there was no significant difference in the amount among these compounds. The reason for the increase in the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in vitro by the in vivo treatment with thymidine is discussed."
