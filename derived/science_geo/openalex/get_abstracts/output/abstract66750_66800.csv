Within a week, a dose that initially abolished responding completely was without effect. This dose was gradually increased to 20 times its original value without disrupting the behavior. No withdrawal syndrome was detected when the cannabinol was discontinued."

https://openalex.org/W1987818627,"A new type of tapetum lucidum has been found in eyes of bony fishes (teleosts). It is retinal, lying in the processes of the pigment epithelial cells; it has a white appearance and reflects light diffusely. The cell processes are loaded with highly refractile lipid particles; as examined by electron microscopy these are about 400 nanometers in diameter, spherical, and homogeneous. This tapetum lucidum has been found in seven families of teleost fishes occurring in inshore waters and rivers of South Texas, all of which have high turbidity; the correlation indicates a role in dim-light vision."

https://openalex.org/W2072154514,"Two new interesting modes of action of quinacrine have been discovered. The first concerns a dose-related inhibition of uptake of [8-(3)H] adenosine into host cells of parasitized blood. Second, the drug inhibits the incorporation of tritiated adenosine triphosphate primarily into RNA but also into DNA of the erythrocyte-free malarial parasite Plasmodium berghei."

https://openalex.org/W2088582186,Lunar material returned from the first manned landing on the moon was assayed for the presence of replicating agents possibly harmful to life on earth. Ten species of lower animals were exposed to lunar material for 28 days. No pathological effects attributable to contact with lunar material were detected.
