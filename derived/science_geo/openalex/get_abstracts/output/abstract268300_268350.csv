https://openalex.org/W2001314714,"Four species of myrmicine ants, Aphaenogaster rudis, A. treatae, A. tennesseensis, and A. fulva, use pieces of leaf, mud, and sand grains as tools to carry soft foods from distant sources to the colony. Tools are tended on the food and removed by colony members without regard to which individual brought the tool. Food is gathered more efficiently by tool use than by internal transport. Tool-using behavior may increase the competitive ability of A. rudis in an interspecific dominance hierarchy."

Focal mechanisms from P-wave first motions indicate normal faulting with the western, Great Valley side downdropped relative to the Sierra Nevada block. The northward projection of the fault plane passes beneath Oroville Dam and crops out under the reservoir."
https://openalex.org/W2036685629,"Fruiting bodies described previously as sclerotia of Palaeosclerotium pusillum are cleistothecium-like, enclosed structures, containing spores within an ascus. The cleistothecia are composed of hyphae having dolipore-like septa and are attached to vegetative hyphae having clamp connections. The unique combination of ascomycete-like reproductive bodies and basidiomycete-like hyphae present in this Pennsylvanian fungus suggests that there already existed, during the Middle Pennsylvanian period, a group of fungi intermediate between the Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes."

The addresses given on these occasions dealt with the advancement of knowledge in archaeology and physics. It is now my privilege, as a member of the medical profession, to address you on the advances made during the same period in our knowledge of disease and our means of coping with and preventing it."

The factors causing this effect are described, and an analysis is made of the perturbed solar radiation budget."
