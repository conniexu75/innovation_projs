https://openalex.org/W2156313755,"We investigated by means of an automated ellipsometer the adsorption of prothrombin from a buffer solution by multilayers of 14:0/14:0- and 18:1/18:1-phosphatidylserine (PS) stacked on chromium slides. In this instrument thickness and refractive index of the adsorbed phospholipid and proteins are monitored continuously. Two equations are derived to relate the mass of stacked phospholipids and the mass of protein adsorbed to the thickness and refractive index. These equations are based upon the Lorentz-Lorenz relation among the molar refractivities, refractive indices, and the densities of binary mixtures. Experimental validation of these equations is performed by measuring stacked multilayers of known mass of phosphatidylserine and the adsorption of [125I] albumin and [3H]prothrombin on these multilayers. Using these equations we measured the dissociation constants Kd and the number of binding sites nb of prothrombin. Values of Kd = 0.15 x 10(-8) M and nb = 122 molecules of PS/molecule of prothrombin were observed for di C14:0 PS and values of Kd = 0.45 x 10(-8) M and nb = 54 molecules of PS/molecule of prothrombin for di C18:1 PS. These data compare well to data obtained by other methods available in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W1538529173,"The mode of binding of NADPH and oxidized glutathione to the flavoenzyme glutathione reductase has been determined by x-ray crystallography. Furthermore, two intermediates of the reaction have been produced in the crystal and have been structurally elucidated. All these analyses were done at 0.3 nm resolution. The results allow the stereochemical description of the mechanism of the enzyme. The dinucleotide NADPH is bound in an extended conformation with the nicotinamide ring stacking onto the re-face of the flavin part of FAD, and adenine located at the protein surface. The binding of NADPH results in the 2-electron reduced form of the enzyme, EH2. This form has also been analyzed without any ligand bound. In EH2 the redoxactive disulfide bridge of the protein, which lies at the si-face of the flavin ring, is opened and the sulfur of Cys-58 moves by about 0.1 nm into a position where it can attack one of the sulfurs of the substrate oxidized glutathione. This interchange leads to a mixed glutathione-protein disulfide, which can be stabilized in crystals and has been analyzed. By selectively reacting Cys-58 with iodoacetamide the crystalline enzyme can be blocked in its EH2 state. The imidazole of His-467' is near to all sulfurs taking part in the disulfide bridge exchange and is therefore certainly crucial for catalysis. The crystallographic results establish that electrons flow from NADPH to the substrate GSSG via flavin and the redoxactive protein disulfide bridge. This is consistent with the scheme that has been postulated from biochemical, spectroscopic, and model studies."
https://openalex.org/W1556964559,"NADP-dependent formate dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.2.1.43) from Clostridium thermoaceticum has been purified to a specific activity of about 1100 mumol min-1 mg-1 when assayed at 55 degrees C and pH 7.5. The enzyme is extremely oxygen-sensitive and 7.6 microM of O2 causes 50% inhibition of initial velocity under assay conditions. Purification was done in an atmosphere at 95% N2 and 5% H2 and by including azide, dithionite, and glycerol as stabilizing agents in all buffer solutions. The enzyme contains, in molar ratios, 2 tungsten, 2 selenium, 36 iron, and about 50 inorganic sulfur. It has a molecular weight of about 340,000 and consist of two each of two different subunits giving the composition alpha 2 beta 2. The molecular weight of the alpha-subunit is 96,000 and that of the beta-subunit is 76,000. The selenium resides in the two alpha-subunits. Tungsten is released from the protein on denaturation and may exist as a tungsten cofactor. The enzyme catalyzes a reduction of CO2 with NADPH at pH 7.5 and 55 degrees C and Keq at these conditions is (2.35 +/- 0.49) x 10(-2) if CO2 is considered the active species and (1.48 +/- 0.31) x 10(-3) if HCO3- is the active species."
https://openalex.org/W1518143332,"Summary of Purification Procedures-The purification procedure of the phospholipid transfer activity is summarized in Table I. Although the specific activities are given for each step, only the d > 1.19 fraction and the material purified through the DEAE step were characterized in sufficient detail to provide estimates of PC transfer activity under conditions of linear dose-response and time course. Comparing the initial rates of PC transfer (Fig. 1 and 9), PC transfer activity was purified about 1000-fold at the DEAE step. The specific activity of protein purified further by adsorption to PC vesicles was about 23 pg of PC/3 h/pg of protein, indicating approxi- mately 9600-fold purification, relative to the d > 1.21 fraction. Table I shows approximate recoveries at each step, expressed as a percentage of that of the preceding step. Relatively good recoveries of activity were obtained in the final steps by binding the PC transfer protein to PC vesicles. In the Sepha- rose and ultracentrifugation steps, the recovery of activity was 50 and 70%, respectively, of the recovery of PC vesicles, indicating strong binding of the PC transfer protein to vesicles. The activity of the purified CE exchange protein (Fig. 6, fraction"

https://openalex.org/W1558264886,"We examined the Asn-linked oligosaccharides at individual glycosylation sites of the two envelope glycoproteins of Sindbis virus, E1 and E2. The analysis was done by separating tryptic glycopeptides by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and analyzing the oligosaccharides from isolated glycopeptides by gel filtration chromatography. Both E1 and E2 have two glycosylation sites each in virus grown in chick embryo fibroblasts, baby hamster kidney cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Our results indicate that previously observed host-dependent variation in the oligosaccharides of Sindbis virus glycoproteins are probably attributable to differences in oligosaccharide composition at individual sites of E1 and E2 and not to differences in the frequency of glycosylation of these sites. One of the two glycosylation sites in E1 has exclusively complex type oligosaccharides regardless of the host cell type. However, the second glycosylation site in E1 has high mannose oligosaccharides in virus grown in chick embryo fibroblasts, complex oligosaccharides in virus from baby hamster kidney cells, and both complex and high mannose oligosaccharides in virus from Chinese hamster ovary cells. E2 has one glycosylation site which has primarily high mannose oligosaccharides and one site which has primarily complex type oligosaccharides. Certain sites which have predominantly complex type glycans also have a small number of two specific classes of oligosaccharides which are cleaved by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and may be high mannose type. Our findings are discussed with regard to regulation of oligosaccharide processing in animal cells."

https://openalex.org/W1589703069,"Glutathione S-transferase activities in mouse hepatic cytosols are elevated as much as 11-fold following the administration of BHA (2(3)-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole), a widely used antioxidant food additive. Ethoxyquin (1,2-dihydro-6-ethoxy-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline) and disulfiram [bis(diethyldithiocarbamyl)disulfide] also enhance the activities of glutathione S-transferases and certain other enzymes. Each of these compounds protects rodents against mutagenic and carcinogenic metabolites. A major (pI 8.7) and a minor (pI 9.3) component of the family of mouse hepatic glutathione S-transferases have been purified to homogeneity. These transferases are immunologically cross-reactive, and have a high degree of NH2-terminal sequence homology (but are not identical). The enzymes differ in a number of molecular and catalytic properties. The transferases are 12-fold elevated by dietary BHA as demonstrated by immunotitration. The mRNA for the major glutathione S-transferase is increased more than 20-fold in the liver RNA of BHA-fed mice, as determined by translation of total liver mRNA and characterization of the products by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis or by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A cDNA plasmid complementary to glutathione S-transferase mRNA was constructed. Translation of liver mRNA selected by hybridization with this plasmid gave products similar to or identical with glutathione S-transferase polypeptides. The cDNA insert has been partially sequenced and its orientation has been determined. Its sequence corresponds to the NH2-terminal region (beginning at residue 9) of the amino acid sequence of the glutathione S-transferase with pI 9.3. Hybridization of the 32P-labeled cDNA plasmid with total liver RNA indicates a 26-fold increase in homologous mRNA in response to the feeding of BHA."
https://openalex.org/W1540963282,"The binding of troponin-I to tropomyosin, as well as its effects on the binding of troponin-T and its fragments T1 (residues 1-158) and T2 (residues 159-259) to tropomyosin, have been studied using immobilized alpha-tropomyosin. When applied alone, troponin-I exhibited weak interaction with tropomyosin and was eluted with a NaCl gradient at 0.12 M. Intact troponin-T was eluted at 0.40 M NaCl, while its fragment T1 was eluted from site 1 (near the COOH terminus of tropomyosin) at 0.32 M, independently from T2, which was eluted from site 2 (near Cys-190) at 0.22 M NaCl. However, the simultaneous presence of troponin-I and T2 resulted in formation of a strong troponin-I/T2/tropomyosin ternary complex at site 2 such that troponin-I/T2 complex was now eluted at 0.45 to 0.5 M NaCl. This binding was Ca2+-sensitive in the presence of troponin-C. An additional effect of troponin-I binding at site 2 was the strengthening of the T1/tropomyosin interaction at site 1, such that T1 was now eluted at the higher value of 0.45 to 0.50 M NaCl. Troponin-I also enhanced the binding of intact troponin-T to tropomyosin. These results suggest that cooperativity exists between the two sites, presumably induced by the binding of troponin-I to tropomyosin and mediated by a conformational change in the latter."
https://openalex.org/W1512173400,"A new biologically active peptide of the neurotensin (NT) family, shown previously to cross-react in a COOH-terminal-directed radioimmunoassay for bovine NT, has been isolated from extracts of chicken intestine and identified as H-Lys-Asn-Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu-OH, which is identical with the biologically active COOH-terminal half of NT except for the amino acid substitutions Lys/Arg and Asn/Arg. It is proposed that this peptide be referred to as Lys8, Asn9, NT8-13 (LANT-6). Synthetic material prepared with this amino acid sequence using the Merrifield technique was immunochemically, chromatographically, and biologically indistinguishable from the native peptide. In contrast to chicken NT which induced hypotension, hyperglycemia, increased vascular permeability, and cyanosis when injected intravenously into anesthetized rats, synthetic LANT-6 brought about primarily a hypertensive response and had little ability to promote hyperglycemia, increased vascular permeability, and cyanosis. In rats pretreated with the alpha-blocker phentolamine and in adrenalectomized rats, the hypertensive response to LANT-6 was blocked, suggesting that adrenal catecholamines mediated this effect. These findings suggest that LANT-6, a natural variant of NT with a different spectrum of biologic activity, may be a NT-related messenger peptide with a different function(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1513768405,"We have investigated the metabolism and intracellular translocation of a fluorescent derivative of phosphatidic acid, 1-acyl-2-[(N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)aminocaproyl] phosphatidic acid (C6-NBD-PA), and its metabolites, in Chinese hamster fibroblasts. This derivative is rapidly transferred from phospholipid vesicles to cells at 2 degrees C, and results in fluorescent labeling of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear membrane of intact cells during its metabolism predominantly to fluorescent diglyceride (Pagano, R. E., Longmuir, K. J., Martin, O. C., and Struck, D. K. (1981) J. Cell Biol. 91, 872-877). In the present study, we show that, upon warming to 37 degrees C, the fluorescence associated with the endoplasmic reticulum was greatly reduced, while cytoplasmic lipid droplets, which were initially nonfluorescent, became intensely labeled. This altered intracellular distribution of fluorescence was accompanied by further metabolism of the fluorescent lipids to NBD-triglyceride and NBD-phosphatidylcholine. Although NBD-fatty acid was also produced, it was not re-utilized in the synthesis of other cellular lipids. Subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that primarily NBD-labeled triglyceride was associated with the intracellular lipid droplets, although substantial amounts of NBD-labeled phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and diglyceride were also present in the whole cell extracts. This finding was confirmed in a separate experiment in which the fluorescent lipids associated with the intracellular lipid droplets were selectively and irreversibly photobleached in situ. Extraction and analysis of the fluorescent lipids revealed that NBD-triglyceride was preferentially photobleached. These results indicate that sorting of the NBD-labeled lipids into various cytoplasmic compartments accompanied their metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1480676402,"Monoclonal antibody directed against RNA polymerases IIO and IIA completely inhibits specific transcription from the major late promoter of adenovirus-2. At comparable antibody concentrations, only a slight inhibition of polymerase III transcription of VA RNA I is observed. Inhibition of polymerase II transcription is specific for monoclonal IgM directed against RNA polymerase II. High concentrations of control IgM do not inhibit transcription. Specific transcription from the conalbumin and ovalbumin promoters is also inhibited by polymerase-specific monoclonal IgM but not control IgM. These results suggest that the in vitro transcription of the conalbumin, ovalbumin, and adenovirus-2 major late promoter is catalyzed by RNA polymerase(s) IIO and/or IIA but not RNA polymerase IIB. However, transcription from calf thymus DNA, known to contain nicks, is not inhibited by polymerase specific monoclonal antibody. Thus, the monoclonal antibody does not interfere with initiation or elongation of RNA polymerase from nonpromoter sites but does appear to selectively inhibit transcription from promoter sites."
https://openalex.org/W1526290020,"Protein phosphorylation of G0/G1-arrested Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (CC139 line) has been analyzed following stimulation by fetal calf serum (FCS) or by a variety of growth factors. FCS stimulated the phosphorylation of three major polypeptides separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: a nuclear protein with a Mr of 62,000 daltons, the ribosomal protein S6, and a cytosoluble peptide of 27,000 daltons. These phosphorylations occurred rapidly after serum stimulation (1 min for the 27,000-dalton peptide, 5 min for S6 and the 62,000-dalton proteins) and were maximal after 30 min. In nonstimulated cells the 27,000-dalton phosphopeptide exists in two forms with isoelectric points of 5.7 and 6.0; serum increased the amount of the most acidic form. At low concentrations, the commitment growth factors, alpha-thrombin, eye-derived growth factor (EDGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), stimulated phosphorylation of the 27,000-dalton peptide. At higher concentrations, these factors alone reinitiated DNA synthesis and, like FCS, stimulated phosphorylation of the three major peptides. In contrast, and suggesting a different mechanism of action, progression factors such as insulin (1-10 micrograms/ml) and multiplication-stimulating activity (MSA) are unable to stimulate phosphorylation of the 27,000-dalton peptide. However, insulin or MSA which are known to potentiate the mitogenic action of alpha-thrombin, PDGF, EDGF, ... were also found to potentiate phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6. These results support the existence of two classes of growth factors and suggest that protein phosphorylation is an early event involved in the control of the cellular G0 leads to G1 transition."
https://openalex.org/W1538479555,"Experiments were performed to examine how human granulocytes process the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe after stimulation by the same peptide. Purified human granulocytes were stimulated with 50 nM N-formyl-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe at 37 degrees C for various times, washed, lysed by N2 cavitation, and fractionated by isopycnic sucrose density gradient sedimentation. The major subcellular fractions identified were plasma membrane, Golgi, granules, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. After 1 min of stimulation, radioactivity was found only in the plasma membrane (sedimentable) and cytosol (soluble) fraction. At 5, 10, and 25 min, radioactivity also appeared in a sedimentable, low density fraction (25-28% sucrose) enriched in galactosyl transferase activity and containing Golgi structures. The accumulation in the sedimentable fractions was maximal after 5 min but continued to increase linearly in the cytosol fraction. Incorporation of radioactivity into cells or membrane and soluble fractions was 60 to 85% specific and was inhibited if incubation with N-formyl-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe was performed at 4 degrees C. 80-90% of the radiolabel in the plasma membrane or Golgi-containing fractions remained sedimentable despite freeze thawing or sonication. Solubilization of these fractions in Triton X-100 followed by Sepharose 4B column chromatography revealed that the radiolabel eluted in the void volume. Our results are consistent with internalization which proceeds by passage of an occupied receptor in a high affinity, supramolecular complex from the plasma membrane to the Golgi followed by accumulation of peptide in the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1568143105,"A 19-residue, thyroxine (T4)-containing peptide, Tryp-T4, has been isolated from the tryptic digest of a low molecular weight, iodine-enriched fragment derived from 19S bovine thyroglobulin. This tryptic peptide represents the only site of significant iodination in the parent polypeptide fragment. The amino acid sequence of the tryptic peptide has been determined and is NH2-Asn-Ile-Phe-Glu-T4-Gln-Val-Asp-Ala-Gln-Pro-Leu-Arg-Pro-Cys-Glu-Leu-Gln- Arg-COOH. The carboxyl-terminal sequence of this peptide shows a high probability of a beta-turn. These findings establish the involvement of at least a single unique sequence within thyroglobulin in thyroxine biosynthesis and the general nature of a hormonogenic site within this protein. This sequence contains at least 30% of the thyroxine present in 19 S bovine thyroglobulin."
https://openalex.org/W1530387751,"N6-(p-Azidobenzyl)adenosine (ABA) and nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) were employed as covalent probes of the nucleoside transport mechanism in human erythrocytes. NBMPR, a potent inhibitor of nucleoside transport, binds tightly (KD 0.3-1 nM) to specific sites on nucleoside transporter elements. ABA, a less potent inhibitor of uridine influx, competitively inhibited NBMPR binding (Ki 15 nM). [3H]ABA was bound tightly (KD 13.4 nM) but reversibly to sites on erythrocytes which appeared to be those which bind NBMPR. ABA binding was inhibited by uridine and adenosine. Irradiation with UV light caused site-bound [3H]ABA on erythrocyte membranes to become covalently bound and, similarly, photoactivation resulted in covalent attachment of membrane-bound [3H]NBMPR. In the presence of dithiothreitol, a free radical scavenger, photoactivation of the site-bound 3H-ligand on membranes depleted of extrinsic membrane proteins resulted in selective incorporation of 3H into band 4.5 of the membrane polypeptides which were resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electropherograms. This result, when considered with previous findings, indicates that the NBMPR-binding component of the nucleoside transport mechanism (or the entire mechanism, if the NBMPR site is an integral part) is a band 4.5 polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1564101110,"Two new substrate classes that can be halogenated by haloperoxidase have been discovered. The enzymatic halogenation of alkynes yields alpha-halogenated ketones, and the enzymatic halogenation of cyclopropanes yields alpha, gamma-halohydrins. The general reaction scheme proposed involves the initial formation of hypohalous acid as the key intermediate. This proposed mechanism, based upon observed differences in product selectivities, is opposite of that proposed previously, based upon observed differences in substrate selectivities. The biosynthetic implications of these novel haloperoxidase reactions are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1586039032,"Lectin induced in the hemolymph of Sarcophaga peregrina (flesh fly) larvae on injury of the body wall or on pupation was studied further by radioimmunoassay, focusing on the interaction between the lectin and hemocytes. It was found that the amount of lectin on the surface of hemocytes prepared from injured larvae increased with time after injury of the body wall. Radioiodinated lectin could bind to hemocytes prepared from injured larvae more effectively than those from normal larvae, indicating a difference in the affinities to lectin of hemocytes from these two sources. The lectin was found to be synthesized in the fat-body and then secreted into the hemolymph both on injury of the body wall and on pupation. A significant level of lectin was maintained in pupae during the entire pupal stage, but it decreased rapidly before emergence, and no lectin was found in newly emerged flies. Since the lectin greatly activated the activity of mouse bone marrow cells to kill Candida parapsilosis cells, the biological significance of humoral lectin in the defense mechanism was discussed from the ontogenic viewpoint."

https://openalex.org/W1604205432,"We have studied the effect of tunicamycin (TM), an antibiotic which inhibits the glycosylation of nascent proteins, on the properties of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the surface of embryonic chick skeletal muscle cells. The use of two separate assays, specific binding of 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin and carbamylcholine-activated 22Na+ uptake, has allowed us to monitor the effects of impaired glycosylation on the metabolic and functional properties of AChR. A significant decrease in the amounts of surface AChR elaborated in the presence of TM is detected by both measurements. This decrease has been found to reflect an enhanced proteolytic degradation of the underglycosylated AChR. The underglycosylated AChR, expressed on the cell surface in the presence of TM, retains the capability of mediating agonist-activated ionic permeability changes, but displays quantitatively altered interactions with receptor ligands. We conclude that the carbohydrate moiety on AChR may play a role in determining the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides to form a conformation compatible with the metabolic properties and ligand interactions characteristic of glycosylated AChR."
https://openalex.org/W1482791930,"Abstract A crude glycolipid fraction was isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 356 by ethanolic extraction and silica gel chromatography. After deacylation of the glycolipid fraction, a dipyruvylated pentasaccharide (acidic oligosaccharide A) and a monopyruvylated tetrasaccharide (acidic oligosaccharide B1) were purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Methylation analysis, proton nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, and periodate oxidation suggested that oligosaccharide A was 4,6-(1-carboxyethylidene)-3-O-methyl-beta-D Glcp-(1-3)-4,6-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-D-Glcp-(1-4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1-6)-alpha- D Glcp-(1-1)-alpha-D-Glcp and that oligosaccharide B1 was 4,6-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-D-Glcp-(1-4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1-6)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1-1 ) -alpha-D-Glcp. Both compounds contain a trehalose unit as a part of the oligosaccharide structure, and B1 appears to be a biosynthetic precursor of A because the two differ only in a pyruvylated 3-O-methylglucose unit. A third component, acidic oligosaccharide B2, differs from oligosaccharide A only in lacking 1 of the 2 pyruvate residues."

https://openalex.org/W1606430929,"The electron transfer flavoprotein from pig liver mitochondria is a 57,000-dalton electron transferase which links several primary flavoprotein dehydrogenases with the mitochondrial electron transport system. The protein was previously reported to be a dimer of apparently identical subunits. There are conflicting estimates in the literature regarding the FAD content of the protein. The results presented here clearly show that the protein contains nonidentical subunits based on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 8 M urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate. The molecular weights of the subunits are 31,000 and 27,000. Analysis of peptides generated by cleavage of the subunits with cyanogen bromide show that the subunits have different primary structures. This result and amino acid analyses of the protein and the purified subunits show that the heterogeneity cannot be due to proteolysis. Using an experimentally determined molar extinction coefficient for the protein-bound flavin, a minimum Mr = 55,000 was calculated, indicating that the protein contains 1 mol of FAD/mol of protein."
https://openalex.org/W1508436080,"Incubation of 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex with 2-ketoisovalerate, 2-keto-4-methylvalerate, or 2-keto-3-methylvalerate leads to the appearance of a lag phase and of a progressive loss of activity in subsequent measurements of the initial rate of oxidation of 2-ketoglutarate. In the case of 2-ketoisovalerate these effects are shown to be due to the formation of an isobutyryllipoate derivative of the enzyme, as a result of the very slow oxidation of 2-ketoisovalerate by the enzyme complex (Vmax congruent to 0.15% of that for 2-ketoglutarate). Incubation of the enzyme complex with 2-keto[14C]isovalerate or 2-keto[14C]glutarate results in comparable incorporation of radioactivity, amounting to 3.5 to 5.3 nmol of isobutyryl or succinyl residues per mg of protein in the complex. Isobutyryl residues are also incorporated in the enzyme during the simultaneous oxidation of both of these substrates. During the early phase of incubation of the complex with 2-ketoisovalerate the incorporation of isobutyryl residues is much faster than the loss of enzyme activity. This observation seems to support the suggestion that each 2-ketoglutarate decarboxylase subunit of the complex may catalyze the succinylation of more than one lipoate succinyltransferase subunit. Results are also presented showing the inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex on preincubation with 2-ketoisovalerate and of 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex with methylenecyclopropylpyruvate, the keto acid corresponding to the toxic amino acid hypoglycin. The relevance of covalent modifications of the two keto acid dehydrogenase complexes to the pathological manifestations of maple syrup urine disease are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1484674647,"The rate of dissociation of oxygen from soybean oxyleghemoglobin a increases about 5-fold between pH 4 and pH 7, with apparent pK = 5.46 and n = 1. The rate of dissociation of carbon monoxide from carbon monoxyleghemoglobin a and the rates of combination of oxygen and carbon monoxide with ferrous leghemoglobin a are all invariant in this range of pH. The optical spectrum of oxyleghemoglobin in the visible region and the resonances of the four heme meso protons (protons of the bridge carbon atoms) in the NMR spectrum of oxyleghemoglobin are also dependent on pH with pK near 5.5. We suggest that protonation of the imidazole of the distal histidine residue (His 61) leads to formation of a hydrogen bond to the bound oxygen molecule which affects the electronic configuration or conformation of the heme and decreases the rate of oxygen dissociation."

In the proteoliposomes Na+-D-glucose cotransport was demonstrated by showing that the D-glucose concentration in the liposomes increased far above the equilibrium value if a Na+ gradient was applied. The initial D-glucose uptake rate, stimulated by an inside directed gradient of 89 mM Na+, was 4 pmol/mg of protein-1 s-1. High affinity phlorizin binding could not be measured. After two precipitation steps with the solubilized membrane proteins, a protein fraction was obtained in which significantly high affinity phlorizin binding was detected. After reconstitution, proteoliposomes were formed in which more than 70% of the protein was represented by two polypeptides with molecular weights of 94,000 and 52,000. An initial Na+ gradient-dependent D-glucose uptake rate of 118 pmol/mg of protein-1 s-1 was obtained. In these liposomes, the D-glucose uptake rate could be inhibited by phlorizin (Ki = 0.3 microM), and 55-pmol phlorizin-binding sites per mg of protein (KD = 0.5 microM) were measured. In different liposomal preparations a correlation between Na+ gradient-dependent D-glucose uptake rate and the amount of 52,000 molecular weight polypeptide was observed."

The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 27,000 and is resistant to metal ion chelators, but inhibited by high concentrations of either mono or divalent cations. This glycosylase is unable to release uracil from the mononucleotides dUMP and dUTP or from wheat germ RNA. Twelve pyrimidine analogues which closely mimic uracil structurally and the nucleoside uridine were examined for their ability to inhibit glycosylase activity. However, only 5-azauracil and 6-aminouracil inhibited enzymatic release of uracil to the same degree as uracil itself. An inhibitor induced by bacteriophage T5 which inhibits Escherichia coli uracil-DNA glycosylase has been shown not to affect the glycosylase isolated from wheat germ, indicating that these two enzymes differ. The ability of the wheat germ uracil-DNA glycosylase to completely remove available uracil from synthetic DNA substrates in which thymine had been replaced by uracil in varying percentages was also examined and found not to depend on percentage of uracil in the substrates."

https://openalex.org/W1961837574,"In order to obtain a comprehensive overview of the noncollagenous proteins (NCPs) of bone matrix, the NCPs were extracted from rat compact bone and fractionated using methods aiming to prevent artifactual degradation and losses of protein. The NCP content of rat bone was found to be similar to that of rat dentin in several respects but different in others. The soluble NCPs of bone fell into four categories: acidic glycoproteins, gamma-carboxyglutamate-containing proteins, phosphoproteins, and proteoglycans. With the exception of the gamma-carboxyglutamate-containing proteins, the majority of NCPs had apparent molecular weights exceeding 50,000. As in rat dentin, several gamma-carboxyglutamate-containing proteins could be demonstrated in rat bone. Earlier studies have only taken one molecular species into consideration. No highly phosphorylated phosphoprotein could be demonstrated in bone. However, at least two phosphoproteins with a low degree of phosphorylation were found to be present. No plasma proteins could be demonstrated in any of the chromatographic fractions from the EDTA extracted NCPs by means of double diffusion. The NCPs, remaining firmly associated with the collagenous matrix after thorough demineralization and extraction, were analyzed after CNBr and collagenase degradation of the matrix. Much smaller amounts of phosphoprotein were recovered after CNBr digestion than reported earlier. Collagenase digestion released small amounts of acidic glycoprotein, phosphoprotein, and proteoglycan. The results give additional evidence that this small remainder might be explained, not by any covalent linkage to collagen, but by an inefficient extraction."
https://openalex.org/W1606441759,"The interaction of the antimitotic drug vincristine with tubulin has been investigated by the techniques of self-assembly, velocity sedimentation, fluorescence, circular dichroism, and differential spectroscopy. Vincristine has been shown to inhibit the self-assembly of tubulin into microtubules at substoichiometric concentrations. The sedimentation velocity patterns at low vincristine concentration (less than 1 X 10(-5) M to 7 X 10(-5) M) consist of a bimodal boundary with a 5.8 S peak and a fast moving peak, with a nominal S20,w value of 9 S. The data conform to the ligand-promoted self-association theory of Cann and Goad (Cann, J.R., and Goad, W.B. (1972) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 153, 603-609). At higher vincristine concentrations (greater than 8 X 10(-5 M), most of the protein is polymerized and sediments as a hypersharp peak with a nominal S20,w value of approximately 20 S. The association constant for the binding of vincristine to tubulin, determined by spectrofluorometry, is 3.5 X 10(4) liters/mol at 25 degrees C. The binding of vincristine does not induce any significant conformational changes in tubulin; however, the difference spectral results indicate perturbation of both vincristine and protein chromophores."
https://openalex.org/W1548728361,"We have developed a rapid turbidimetric assay for the release of cortical granule contents from cortices prepared from eggs of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. The decrease in turbidity of cortex suspensions which occurs when the free calcium ion concentration is increased to 0.38-0.62 microM can be followed spectrophotometrically. Kinetic experiments demonstrate that this calcium-triggered turbidity change occurs rapidly and with no detectable lag period. Evidence indicating that the observed decrease in turbidity results from the release of cortical granule contents was obtained by correlating the free calcium ion concentration required to initiate the turbidity change with the free calcium ion concentration required in microscopic and enzymatic assays. All three assays exhibited similar calcium dependence. In the microscopic assay, morphological changes are used to assess the extent of cortical granule exocytosis. The enzymatic assay is based upon the latency of ovoperoxidase, a cortical granule enzyme. Ovoperoxidase catalyzed a 30-125-fold increase in the incorporation of [125I]iodine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable cortex protein at and above threshold calcium ion concentrations. We have utilized the turbidimetric assay to screen several potential inhibitors of the cortical reaction. In confirmation of previous reports, we find that the phenothiazine drugs, chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine, are inhibitory. Sulfhydryl-modifying reagents, N-ethylmaleimide and sodium tetrathionate, are also inhibitory. Inhibition of cortical granule enzyme release by N-ethylmaleimide was confirmed with the ovoperoxidase latency assay."
https://openalex.org/W1602710240,"Synemin, a 230,000-dalton protein associated with desmin- and vimentin-containing intermediate filaments (Granger, B. L., and Lazarides, E. (1980) Cell 22, 727-738), has been purified from gizzard smooth muscle and biochemically characterized. Purification was achieved by extracting the salt-insoluble pellet of muscle protein with 6 M urea and chromatography of the urea extract on columns of hydroxylapatite, DEAE-Sephacel, and phosphocellulose. The soluble form of synemin is a globular tetramer of 980,000 daltons with a S20,w of 22.4 +/- 3.2. Synemin has a pI of 5.34, in agreement with its high content in glutamic acid (20%), and is rich in serine (11%) and poor in cysteine (0.4%). Synemin is phosphorylated in smooth muscle and is one of the muscle proteins with the highest capacity to incorporate exogenously added [32P]phosphate. Of the [32P] phosphate incorporated into synemin, 95% is bound to serine and only 5% to threonine. The phosphorylation of synemin is enhanced by the cyclic AMP analog, 8-Br-cyclic AMP. Immunofluorescence studies using anti-synemin antibodies show that purified synemin binds to filaments of desmin assembled in vitro. Synemin specifically inhibits the immunoprecipitation of purified soluble desmin by anti-desmin antibodies, indicating that synemin interacts in vitro with soluble desmin."
https://openalex.org/W1543380962,"We have previously shown that bestatin (an aminopeptidase inhibitor) permits the accumulation of di- and tripeptide intermediates in the degradation of abnormal globin (Botbol, V., and Scornik, O. A. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76, 710-713; Botbol, V., and Scornik, O. A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11254-11257). We now report that this drug (1 mg, intravenously, 5-30 min) causes similar intermediates to appear during breakdown of normal cellular proteins in the livers of live mice labeled 1 or 20 h before with L-[1-14C]Leu or L-[1-14C]Arg. These intermediates represent an estimated 20% of all degraded cellular protein. Lysosomal degradation of labeled asialoglycoproteins taken up by endocytosis is less affected by bestatin. After homogenization and centrifugation of the livers, we find a major fraction of the intermediates in the cytosol. Another fraction sediments at 27,000 X g in 15 min. The fraction that sediments is larger for Arg-labeled (30%) than for Leu-labeled (10%) peptides. The particulate fraction does not represent soluble peptides trapped in the pellet during fractionation because it does not appear when soluble intermediates are added to nonradioactive homogenates. The presence of intermediates in particulate and soluble fractions could result from protein breakdown either in both compartments or in organelles from which the peptides escape. We favor the latter possibility because (a) the particulate fraction does not increase after stimulation of autophagy by injection of glucagon (40 micrograms, 75 min before killing), (b) the subcellular distribution is the same whether intermediates are produced during the degradation of short or long lived proteins, and (c) chromatographic fingerprints of the particulate and soluble components reveal the same seven bands. The presence of well defined intermediates of cellular protein degradation in the particulate fraction of liver homogenates provides a valuable marker in the isolation and characterization of autophagic organelles."
https://openalex.org/W1562412350,"Spectral and kinetic studies are reported for the effects of C-22-substituted steroids on purified bovine adrenocortical cytochrome P-450scc. The results are consistent with the recent proposal that the potency of 22-amino-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3 beta-ol as an inhibitor of the enzyme arises from a dual interaction, the binding of the steroid ring to the cholesterol site and bonding of the amine to the heme iron (Sheets, J.J., and Vickery, L.E., (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 5773-5777). An analogue of the inhibitor with the 5,6 double bond reduced, 22-amino-23,24-bisnor-5 alpha-cholan-3 beta-ol, was synthesized by a similar procedure. A complex of this form with P-450scc produced a 422 nm Soret absorption maximum as found for the parent compound, indicating nitrogen coordination to the heme iron. A decrease in the spectral dissociation constant and inhibitory potency was also observed and is consistent with binding of the steroid ring to the cholesterol site on the enzyme. The 22-hydroxy analogue, 23,24-bisnor-5-cholene-3 beta,22-diol, was also prepared. This derivative produced a complex with P-450scc having a Soret peak at 417 nm as in the substrate-free form of the enzyme; the diol was also a competitive inhibitor, but exhibited decreased potency relative to the amine form. These results provide additional support for the role of amine coordination in producing the 422 nm species and in contributing to tight binding."
https://openalex.org/W1592548755,"The activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the content and turnover of the pyruvate dehydrogenase component were measured during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The specific activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex increased approximately 7-fold in 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated with a treatment of insulin plus dexamethasone plus 1-methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine. The ratio of active pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to total pyruvate dehydrogenase complex remained unaltered in both 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes. A specific goat antibody to bovine kidney pyruvate dehydrogenase quantitatively precipitated both alpha and beta subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase from solubilized 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Using immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis techniques, we demonstrated an approximate 6-fold increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as compared to 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Pulse labeling experiments revealed an approximately 5-fold increase in the rates of synthesis of both alpha and beta subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes after 6 days of the hormonal treatment compared to those observed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. In contrast, the half-lives of alpha and beta subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase were not significantly altered in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (41 h) and adipocytes (49 h). The 6-8-fold increment in the specific activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in 3T3-L1 adipocytes therefore results from increased rates of synthesis of alpha and beta subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1494382868,The assembly of microtubule protein has been investigated under conditions where the microtubule seeds concentration was varied. The plot of the apparent first order elongation rate constant with microtubule number concentration strongly deviated from the linearity predicted by Oosawa's condensation model and reached a limit at a high concentration of seeds. The increase in seeds concentration was quantitatively assessed from the histograms of microtubule length distribution and from the parallel increases in the rate of depolymerization at 4 degrees C and steady state rate of GTP hydrolysis at microtubule ends. The limit elongation rate constant was independent of elongating sites and tubulin concentrations and was attributed to the true first order rate constant of a conformation change of tubulin preceding its assembly in microtubules. It is hypothesized that polymerizable tubulin would represent a small fraction only of the tubulin molecules in equilibrium with unpolymerizable species. Microtubule assembly would follow the shift of this equilibrium which is fast as compared to the rate of polymerization at low concentration of elongating sites but becomes rate limiting at higher concentrations.
https://openalex.org/W1604283581,"Cathepsin B from bovine spleen was shown to catalyze transacylation reactions between esters of N-substituted amino acids and nucleophiles. These reactions appeared to proceed through an intermediate between cathepsin B and the acyl portion of the substrate. Of the various nucleophiles tested, dipeptides were found to be the most effective acyl group acceptors. A method was devised for calculating the acylation and deacylation rate constants from increases in the maximum velocity of disappearance of the substrate with increasing concentrations of the nucleophile. The values for the second order rate constants for the reaction of the acyl-enzyme with the nucleophile, k4, were found to depend on the identity of the dipeptide, while the first order rate constants for formation and hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme, k2 and k3, were dipeptide-independent. With N alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine p-nitrophenyl ester at pH 6.5, k2 and k3 were found to be 360 s-1 and 6.6 s-1, respectively, indicating that the deacylation step was rate-determining for the hydrolysis of this substrate. In contrast, dipeptide nucleophiles did not significantly accelerate the cathepsin B-catalyzed cleavage of either the p-nitroanilide or the 2-naphthylamide of N alpha-benzoylarginine, suggesting that the hydrolysis of these amide substrates was acylation rate-limiting. These findings support the suggestion that cathepsin B is mechanistically similar to the cysteine proteinase papain."

https://openalex.org/W1483317647,"Calmodulin was removed from brain cytosol by DEAE-52 chromatography or by affinity chromatography employing fluphenazine-Sepharose. The substrates phosphorylated by endogenous protein kinase after chromatography differed depending on the method used, and both chromatographic methods altered the phosphorylation pattern as compared to untreated cytosol. Cytosol, chromatographed on fluphenazine-Sepharose, retained most of the characteristics of untreated cytosol. Both calmodulin and phospholipids increased the phosphorylation of specific but separate brain cytosol proteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The effects of phospholipids could be mimicked by the detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the hydrophobic probe, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate. Furthermore, the calmodulin-induced increase in phosphorylation, but not that produced by phospholipids, was blocked by 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate. These results suggest that the effects of phospholipids may not be due to the presence of a specific phospholipid-sensitive protein kinase in cytosol, but rather to a general interaction of hydrophobic probes with either specific substrate proteins or with the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase itself."

The resulting structures have a size and chemical composition very similar to native high density lipoprotein. Deuterium NMR spectra and longitudinal relaxation times were obtained at approximately 25 degrees C. The variation of the 2H NMR line width with chain position is consistent with an average conformation such that the ester acyl chain is extended. In addition, 2H NMR line widths and longitudinal relaxation times indicate that the ester acyl chains possess significant mobility."
https://openalex.org/W1555656315,"The class III RNA polymerases present in Xenopus laevis tissues were solubilized and partially purified by ion exchange chromatography. Single chromatographic species were detected in extracts from ovary, liver, and a kidney-derived cultured cell, whereas two chromatographic forms were detected in liver extracts. All class III enzymes analyzed exhibited characteristic responses to ionic strength changes, synthetic polynucleotide templates, and alpha-amanitin. These chromatographic and catalytic properties readily distinguished all the class III enzymes from the corresponding class I and II enzymes but clearly failed to reveal any significant differences between the various ovarian and somatic class III enzymes (with the possible exception of one of the liver enzyme forms). The ovarian RNA polymerase III was completely soluble in low ionic strength buffers and was subjected to further purification via standard procedures involving differential centrifugation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and ion exchange chromatography. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions revealed at least 10 distinct polypeptides (designated subunits a-j) which were consistently present in near equimolar amounts and which ranged in size from 155,000 to 19,000 daltons. Several smaller polypeptides (less than 19,000) were also evident in all preparations but were not further characterized. Analysis of the chromatographically purified RNA polymerase on nondenaturing gels revealed two electrophoretic forms, although subsequent analysis on denaturing gels failed to reveal any differences in polypeptide composition. From the present data, it is estimated that there are about 4 X 10(9) molecules of RNA polymerase III per oocyte nucleus. This extraordinary level of soluble RNA polymerase III in part explains the ability of oocyte nuclei (or extracts) to support the active transcription of exogenous tRNA and 5 S RNA genes. The present and previous data concerning the properties and structures of the oocyte versus somatic cell enzymes also suggest that the RNA polymerase III present in the oocyte is functionally equivalent to a somatic cell enzyme and support the previous suggestion that this enzyme is conserved and used later in (somatic) embryonic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1661124696,"3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids. The determination of its molecular structure at 5.25-A resolution by x-ray diffraction techniques is described. Three isomorphous derivatives, K2PtCl6, methyl mercuric chloride, and IrCl3, were prepared using crystals previously soaked in an NAD-containing solution. The positions of the heavy atom sites were determined by inspection of Patterson maps and confirmed by cross-difference Fourier maps. After refinement of the heavy atom positions, electron density maps at 5.25-A resolution were calculated. Careful study of these electron density maps revealed a unique crystalline packing arrangement in which the asymmetric unit contained 1.5 dimers of L-3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase. With this packing motif, one L-3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase dimer lies in a general position in the asymmetric unit, while the other dimer is located such that its molecular 2-fold axis is coincident with a crystallographic dyad. At 5.25-A resolution, each L-3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase subunit displays a bilobal structure. The larger lobe, which binds NAD, has approximate dimensions of 37 X 45 X 35 A. The size of the smaller lobe is approximately 30 X 23 X 20 A. Difference Fourier maps between the crystalline apo- and holoenzyme have also been calculated at 5.25-A resolution, and preliminary model fitting studies show that NAD binds to L-3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase in an open conformation similar to that found in other dehydrogenases."

https://openalex.org/W1519139273,"The effects of retinoid addition of vitamin A-depleted (UV-irradiated) culture medium on uridine metabolism in cultured Sertoli cells have been studied. After vitamin A depletion, a consistent 2- to 4-fold enhancement of [3H]uridine incorporation into RNA was observed. Several lines of evidence indicate that this enhancement is the result of an increase in the specific activity of the uridine-labeled precursors of RNA. Although vitamin A depletion did not affect either uridine uptake or alter cellular RNA content, a 5-fold increase in the specific activity of UMP was found in vitamin A-depleted cells. This increase results because the cellular content of uracil nucleosides plus nucleotides is selectively lowered in vitamin A-depleted cells. The decreased content of uridine derivatives could be accounted for by a 45-57% decrease in the activity of glutamine-dependent carbamylphosphate synthetase in vitamin A-depleted cells. The effects of vitamin A deprivation on uridine incorporation, as well as carbamylphosphate synthetase activity, could be completely restored to or above control values by supplementing vitamin A-depleted cell culture medium with either retinol or retinoic acid. This effect of vitamin A depletion appears to be highly specific. Under the same conditions, no gross alteration in either the pattern or extent of synthesis of cellular or secreted proteins, glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans, and lipids was observed. In addition, vitamin A depletion/repletion had no effect on the growth rate or morphology of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1534979750,"The heat of formation of the chymotrypsin-phenylethane boronic acid complex has been observed calorimetrically from pH 4 to 8 at 25 degrees C and is found to be pH-dependent, changing from near -6 kcal/mol at pH 4 to -13 kcal/mol at pH 8. The heat of formation of the chymotrypsin-indole complex is a nearly constant -6 kcal/mol over most of the same pH range. alpha-Chymotrypsin has been purified by pH gradient elution from an immobilized lima bean inhibitor column. Solutions of the enzyme up to 400 microM, prepared in this manner, have a zero heat of dilution from pH 5 to 8 in 0.1 M KCl, with or without added 0.05 M Tris, N-(tris[hydroxy-methyl]methyl-2-amino) ethanesulfonic acid, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, or acetate buffers. Binding of phenylethane boronic acid causes a pH-dependent decrease in proton binding to chymotrypsin; the decrease in proton binding evoked by formation of the indole complex is much less, with a much smaller pH dependence. The calorimetric and proton-binding results are applied to a model for boronic acid binding (Hanai, K. (1976) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 79, 107-116). We conclude that the thermodynamics of formation of the trigonal boronic acid complex are quite similar to those for the formation of the noncovalent complex formed by indole and related ligands. The trigonal-tetrahedral tautomerism in the boronic acid-chymotrypsin complex is characterized by thermodynamic changes similar to those accompanying the binding of virtual substrates to chymotrypsin."
