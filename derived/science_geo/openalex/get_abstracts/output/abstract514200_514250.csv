https://openalex.org/W1972569657,"An organism's behavioral decisions often depend upon the relative strength of appetitive and aversive sensory stimuli, the relative sensitivity to which can be modified by internal states like hunger. However, whether sensitivity to such opposing influences is modulated in a unidirectional or bidirectional manner is not clear. Starved flies exhibit increased sugar and decreased bitter sensitivity. It is widely believed that only sugar sensitivity changes, and that this masks bitter sensitivity. Here we use gene- and circuit-level manipulations to show that sweet and bitter sensitivity are independently and reciprocally regulated by starvation in Drosophila. We identify orthogonal neuromodulatory cascades that oppositely control peripheral taste sensitivity for each modality. Moreover, these pathways are recruited at increasing hunger levels, such that low-risk changes (higher sugar sensitivity) precede high-risk changes (lower sensitivity to potentially toxic resources). In this way, state-intensity-dependent, reciprocal regulation of appetitive and aversive peripheral gustatory sensitivity permits flexible, adaptive feeding decisions."

In response to different types of stimuli, synapses of the CNS have the ability to change their strength in a bidirectional manner, a phenomenon known as synaptic plasticity. The most well-studied forms of synaptic plasticity are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), collectively referred to as Hebbian plasticity. LTP and LTD occur at individual synapses, thus altering the strength of affected synapses relative to nearby unaffected synapses (Malenka and Bear, 2004Malenka R.C. Bear M.F. LTP and LTD: an embarrassment of riches.Neuron. 2004; 44: 5-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2951) Google Scholar). It is widely speculated that the changes in relative synaptic strength via Hebbian plasticity form the molecular and cellular basis of learning and memory. Synapses can also undergo a distinct type of plasticity, known as homeostatic scaling, during which many or all synapses on a given neuron simultaneously change in synaptic strength in a uniform direction (O’Brien et al., 1998O’Brien R.J. Kamboj S. Ehlers M.D. Rosen K.R. Fischbach G.D. Huganir R.L.

Unlike Hebbian plasticity, homeostatic scaling alters the strength of all synapses proportionally (Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar), thus protecting the relative differences in synapse strengths. However, homeostatic plasticity has also been shown to occur at individual synapses (Béïque et al., 2011Béïque J.C. Na Y. Kuhl D. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Arc-dependent synapse-specific homeostatic plasticity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2010bLee M.C. Yasuda R. Ehlers M.D. Metaplasticity at single glutamatergic synapses.Neuron. 2010; 66: 859-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). By engaging homeostatic scaling, neurons are able to adjust their own firing rates toward an ideal set point without disrupting differences in synaptic weights that store information. In this way, homeostatic scaling may function to maintain network stability and promote learning and memory by offsetting the destabilizing effects of continued LTP or LTD (Turrigiano, 2008Turrigiano G.G. The self-tuning neuron: synaptic scaling of excitatory synapses.Cell. 2008; 135: 422-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). However, at present the relationship between Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity is not clear (Arendt et al., 2013Arendt K.L. Sarti F. Chen L. Chronic inactivation of a neural circuit enhances LTP by inducing silent synapse formation.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 2087-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and how scaling is able to proceed without disrupting or erasing the information from previous Hebbian plasticity events is unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear how global and local plasticity simultaneously occur to allow network stability and ongoing learning and memory formation. LTP, LTD, and homeostatic scaling each alter synaptic strength in large part by altering the abundance of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in the postsynaptic membrane (Huganir and Nicoll, 2013Huganir R.L.

The shared molecular output of these different plasticity types strongly suggests that local and global plasticity cannot occur independently, but rather that the two plasticity types will necessarily have elaborate crosstalk or feedback. Tetrameric AMPARs are made from the subunits GluA1–GluA4 and mediate the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the CNS. The majority of AMPARs in the hippocampus and cortex are composed from GluA1/2 and GluA2/3 subunit combinations (Lu et al., 2009Lu W. Shi Y. Jackson A.C. Bjorgan K. During M.J. Sprengel R.

Phosphorylation of AMPAR cytoplasmic C-terminal tails has been shown to have a prominent role in controlling AMPAR synaptic targeting as well as channel properties (Shepherd and Huganir, 2007Shepherd J.D.

Finally, PKC-mediated phosphorylation of GluA2 S880 disrupts the interaction between GluA2 and GRIP, allowing for AMPAR endocytosis and LTD (Chung et al., 2000Chung H.J. Xia J. Scannevin R.H.

Whether changes in AMPAR phosphorylation also occur during homeostatic scaling has not been fully addressed, nor is it clear whether AMPAR phosphorylation is necessary for homeostatic scaling to occur. It is possible that AMPARs may scale differentially depending on the patterns of phosphorylation that occurred during earlier LTP or LTD events. In this way AMPAR phosphorylation may form part of the molecular code to coordinate both global and local synaptic plasticity. Levels of protein phosphorylation are governed by the opposing activities of protein kinases and phosphatases. Scaffold proteins, such as the A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs), can serve as signaling hubs that link second messenger systems, kinases, and phosphatases with particular targets. AKAP5 (also called AKAP79 in humans or AKAP150 in rodents) is a prominent synapse-targeted AKAP that links adenyl cyclase, protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin/PP2B (CaN) with AMPARs (Colledge et al., 2000Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D.

Colledge M. Hell J.W. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. Regulation of GluR1 by the A-kinase anchoring protein 79 (AKAP79) signaling complex shares properties with long-term depression.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that changes in the coupling of AMPARs with PKA occur via the scaffold AKAP5. Reduction in AMPAR-PKA coupling during scaling down results in a decrease in the level of phosphorylated AMPARs and a reduced ability to phosphorylate AMPARs upon neuromodulator stimulation. During scaling up, overall PKA activity is low, but active PKA is concentrated into dendritic spines, resulting in AMPAR S845 phosphorylation and an increased ability to phosphorylate AMPARs upon neuromodulator stimulation. This reorganization of PKA signaling requires the scaffold AKAP5. A GluA1 S845A knockin mutation that eliminated phosphorylation, abolished scaling up, while enhancement of S845 phosphorylation can drive scaling up. Further, we find that phospho-S845 receptors are resistant to scaling down, showing that AMPARs scale differentially based on their phosphorylation status. Finally, using a glycine-based chemical LTP protocol, we show that rearrangements of the PKA signaling pathway following homeostatic scaling alter the ability of cortical neurons to express LTP. Thus, we demonstrate that, like Hebbian plasticity, homeostatic scaling involves changes in AMPAR phosphorylation, but utilizes distinct mechanisms, and thus interacts with Hebbian synaptic plasticity. We first examined AMPAR phosphorylation during homeostatic scaling. Cultured rat cortical neurons were treated with bicuculline or tetrodotoxin (TTX) for 24 or 48 hr, treatments previously shown to induce homeostatic scaling down and scaling up, respectively (O’Brien et al., 1998O’Brien R.J. Kamboj S. Ehlers M.D. Rosen K.R. Fischbach G.D. Huganir R.L. Activity-dependent modulation of synaptic AMPA receptor accumulation.Neuron. 1998; 21: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G.

To monitor the progress of scaling, neurons were surface biotinylated, and surface AMPARs were detected by western blot. Bicuculline treatment resulted in a loss of surface GluA1, GluA2, and GluA3 after 48 hr and (to a lesser degree) after 24 hr. TTX treatment resulted in increased surface GluA1 and GluA2 only after 48 hr of treatment (Figures 1A and 1B ). Thus, bidirectional homeostatic scaling is clearly induced after 48 hr in our system. Interestingly, TTX treatment did not result in an increase in surface GluA3, even after 48 hr, showing that scaling up likely involves GluA1/2 and not GluA2/3 receptor subunit combinations (Figures 1A and 1B). Using phosphospecific antibodies, we examined the levels of phospho-S831 and phospho-S845 on GluA1 and phospho-S880 on GluA2, well-characterized sites previously shown to be involved in Hebbian plasticity (Shepherd and Huganir, 2007Shepherd J.D. Huganir R.L. The cell biology of synaptic plasticity: AMPA receptor trafficking.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 613-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Bicuculline treatment for 48 hr resulted in a significant decrease in AMPA receptor phosphorylation at all three sites (Figures 1A and 1C), with the phospho-S845 levels showing the most prominent decrease. TTX treatment for 48 hr resulted in a significant increase in phospho-S845 levels, but not phospho-S831 or phospho-S880 levels (Figures 1A and 1C). This pattern of S845 phosphorylation was not observed following acute (10 min) bicuculline or TTX treatment (Figures S1A and S1B, available online). Therefore, changes in AMPAR phosphorylation occur during homeostatic scaling. As the PKA-target GluA1 S845 showed the most prominent changes in phosphorylation during homeostatic scaling, we next addressed the molecular basis for changes in AMPAR phosphorylation by PKA. Following a 48 hr treatment with bicuculline or TTX, we first examined protein levels of PKA, calcineurin (CaN), AKAP5, and the β2-adrenergic receptor, as these proteins are all known to regulate synapse targeting of GluA1 and phosphorylation of S845 (Hu et al., 2007Hu H. Real E. Takamiya K. Kang M.G. Ledoux J. Huganir R.L. Malinow R.

Adenylyl cyclase anchoring by a kinase anchor protein AKAP5 (AKAP79/150) is important for postsynaptic β-adrenergic signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 17918-17931Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We observed no change in the levels of the PKA catalytic subunit or the β2-adrenergic receptor following scaling. After bicuculline treatment to induce scaling down, there were small but significant decreases in the levels of the catalytic subunit of CaN and AKAP5 (Figures 2A and 2B ). Decreased CaN phosphatase upon bicuculline treatment would be expected to result in increased GluA1 S845 phosphorylation, contrary to our observations. On the other hand, AKAP5 is known to anchor PKA with the GluA1 AMPAR subunit (Sanderson and Dell’Acqua, 2011Sanderson J.L. Dell’Acqua M.L. AKAP signaling complexes in regulation of excitatory synaptic plasticity.Neuroscientist. 2011; 17: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, the decrease in AKAP5 protein following bicuculline treatment suggested that a loss of coupling between PKA and GluA1 may be responsible for decreased S845 phosphorylation during scaling down. To address this possibility, we treated neurons with bicuculline or TTX for 48 hr to induce scaling and then challenged the neurons for 5 min with isoproterenol (10 nM), a noradrenaline analog known to cause cyclic AMP (cAMP)/PKA-mediated phosphorylation of GluA1 S845 through the β2-adrenergic receptor (Hu et al., 2007Hu H. Real E. Takamiya K. Kang M.G. Ledoux J. Huganir R.L. Malinow R.

Ulrich J.D. et al.Assembly of a beta2-adrenergic receptor—GluR1 signalling complex for localized cAMP signalling.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As expected, isoproterenol challenge resulted in a clear increase in phospho-S845 levels in previously untreated neurons. Interestingly, phosphorylation of S845 following isoproterenol challenge was significantly reduced in neurons pretreated with bicuculline and increased in neurons pretreated with TTX (Figures 2C and 2D). As the protein levels of the β2-adrenergic receptor were not altered, we believe these observations are the result of suppression or enhancement of PKA activity toward GluA1 during scaling down or up, respectively. Indeed, this phosphorylation pattern was not observed at nonsynaptic PKA targets, such as CREB (S133) or inhibitor protein 1 (I-1, T35), upon isoproterenol treatment (Figures S1C and S1D) or at the PKC target GluA2 S880 upon PKC activation with phorbol ester PMA (Figures S1E and S1F). In addition, acute treatment with bicuculline or TTX did not affect isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of S845 (Figures S1A and S1B). Therefore, not only are the levels of phosphorylated GluA1 S845 altered during homeostatic scaling, but the ability of PKA to phosphorylate GluA1 in response to stimuli is altered. These results suggest the specific rearrangements of PKA signaling at the synapse during scaling. We also examined the cellular distribution and association of PKA and AKAP5 during homeostatic scaling using immunofluorescence microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation (coIP), respectively.

We determined a spine enrichment value by measuring the staining intensity of PKA in the dendritic spines versus the dendritic shaft. We observed a significant decrease in the localization of PKA to dendritic spines following 48 hr bicuculline treatment but no change following TTX treatment (Figures 2E and 2F). AKAP5 was more enriched in dendritic spines, and this distribution was not altered during homeostatic scaling (Figures 2G and 2H). The removal of PKA, but not AKAP5, from dendritic spines during scaling down suggests that the association between the two proteins may be decreased. Indeed, we detected a decrease in the coimmunoprecipitation of PKA and AKAP5 following bicuculline treatment (Figure 2I). In parallel, we were also interested in the overall level and distribution of PKA activity during homeostatic scaling. To address this, we performed western blot on control, bicuculline-, or TTX-treated samples using an antibody raised against a consensus PKA phosphosubstrate. We found that the overall western blot signal was not altered in bicuculline-treated samples compared to untreated samples but was significantly reduced in TTX-treated samples (Figures 3A and 3B ). No significant changes were seen under these conditions using a similar PKC phosphosubstrate antibody (Figures 3A and 3B). We confirmed that these antibodies were phosphospecific (Figure S2). Next, we examined the dendritic distribution of PKA activity during homeostatic scaling using a previously developed fluorescence-resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor, A-kinase activity reporter (AKAR4) (Depry et al., 2011Depry C. Allen M.D. Zhang J. Visualization of PKA activity in plasma membrane microdomains.Mol. Biosyst. 2011; 7: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, Zhang and Allen, 2007Zhang J. Allen M.D. FRET-based biosensors for protein kinases: illuminating the kinome.Mol. Biosyst. 2007; 3: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This reporter contains a PKA target site and upon phosphorylation undergoes a conformational shift resulting in an increased FRET signal. Using this FRET reporter, we found PKA activity distributed equally in dendritic spines and dendritic shaft in control neurons. Following bicuculline treatment, there was a significant reduction in PKA activity in dendritic spines relative to dendritic shaft. In contrast, following TTX treatment, the activity of PKA in dendritic spines was greatly increased compared to that in dendritic shafts (Figures 3C and 3D). Finally, we purified postsynaptic densities (PSD) from bicuculline- or TTX-treated neurons (Figure 3E) and examined PKA activity in the PSD using the PKA substrate antibody. Unlike the pattern observed in whole-cell lysate, PKA activity in the PSD was increased following TTX treatment (Figures 3F and 3G). Furthermore, we observed that the scaffold AKAP5 showed a significant increase in PSD association following TTX treatment (Figures 3F and 3H). As AKAP5 targeting to dendritic spines is not altered during scaling (Figures 2G and 2H), it is likely that increased AKAP5 in the PSD is supplied from a perisynaptic pool of AKAP5 molecules. Overall, these findings show that PKA activity is high during scaling down, but there is a loss of PKA protein and activity fro"

However, the neural circuitry underlying the rewarding aspects of autobiographical memory is poorly understood. Using fMRI, we observed enhanced activity during the recall of positive relative to neutral autobiographical memories in corticostriatal circuits that also responded to monetary reward. Enhanced activity in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex was associated with increases in positive emotion during recall, and striatal engagement further correlated with individual measures of resiliency. Striatal response to the recall of positive memories was greater in individuals whose mood improved after the task. Notably, participants were willing to sacrifice a more tangible reward, money, in order to reminisce about positive past experiences. Our findings suggest that recalling positive autobiographical memories is intrinsically valuable, which may be adaptive for regulating positive emotion and promoting better well-being."

https://openalex.org/W2156537511,"The antimicrobial activities of garlic and other plant alliums are primarily based on allicin, a thiosulphinate present in crushed garlic bulbs. We set out to determine if pure allicin and aqueous garlic extracts (AGE) exhibit antimicrobial properties against the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), the major bacterial phytopathogen for alliums and an intrinsically multiresistant and life-threatening human pathogen. We prepared an AGE from commercial garlic bulbs and used HPLC to quantify the amount of allicin therein using an aqueous allicin standard (AAS). Initially we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the AGE against 38 Bcc isolates; these MICs ranged from 0.5 to 3% (v/v). The antimicrobial activity of pure allicin (AAS) was confirmed by MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays against a smaller panel of five Bcc isolates; these included three representative strains of the most clinically important species, B. cenocepacia. Time kill assays, in the presence of ten times MIC, showed that the bactericidal activity of AGE and AAS against B. cenocepacia C6433 correlated with the concentration of allicin. We also used protein mass spectrometry analysis to begin to investigate the possible molecular mechanisms of allicin with a recombinant form of a thiol-dependent peroxiredoxin (BCP, Prx) from B. cenocepacia. This revealed that AAS and AGE modifies an essential BCP catalytic cysteine residue and suggests a role for allicin as a general electrophilic reagent that targets protein thiols. To our knowledge, we report the first evidence that allicin and allicin-containing garlic extracts possess inhibitory and bactericidal activities against the Bcc. Present therapeutic options against these life-threatening pathogens are limited; thus, allicin-containing compounds merit investigation as adjuncts to existing antibiotics."

Using fast, genetically encoded voltage indicators in dissociated primary neurons, we show that at small nerve terminals K+ channels constrain the peak voltage of the presynaptic action potential (APSYN) to values much lower than those at cell somas. This key APSYN property additionally shows adaptive plasticity: manipulations that increase presynaptic Ca2+ channel abundance and release probability result in a commensurate lowering of the APSYN peak and narrowing of the waveform, while manipulations that decrease presynaptic Ca2+ channel abundance do the opposite. This modulation is eliminated upon blockade of Kv3.1 and Kv1 channels. Our studies thus reveal that adaptive plasticity in the APSYN waveform serves as an important regulator of synaptic function."

These results suggest that SCS should be considered as an additional treatment option for patients with PD. Chronic electrical stimulation of subcortical brain structures, a procedure known as deep-brain stimulation (DBS), has become an important complement to dopamine replacement therapy in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson disease (PD) (Benabid et al., 1987Benabid A.L. Pollak P. Louveau A. Henry S. de Rougemont J. Combined (thalamotomy and stimulation) stereotactic surgery of the VIM thalamic nucleus for bilateral Parkinson disease.Appl.

Following the initial report on rodent PD models, SCS has been evaluated for treatment of PD in a few clinical case studies. Results of these studies range from no measurable improvements in two patients (Thevathasan et al., 2010Thevathasan W. Mazzone P. Jha A. Djamshidian A. Dileone M. Di Lazzaro V. Brown P.

More importantly, in some cases SCS achieved PD symptom relief equivalent to the best effects obtained with pharmacological treatment (Fénelon et al., 2012Fénelon G. Goujon C. Gurruchaga J.-M.

At present, the underlying causes for the different outcomes in these preliminary clinical studies are not known, but variations in electrode design, spinal cord implantation location, and choice of stimulation parameters have been suggested as possible contributing factors (Fuentes et al., 2010Fuentes R.

One way to optimize the application of this potential therapy for PD is to establish what neurophysiological changes are associated with the relief of symptoms, and to evaluate how these changes can be most effectively induced. Here, we have addressed these questions by characterizing the behavioral and neurophysiologic SCS effects in 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine) lesioned marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus), a primate model of PD. Using previously described procedures (Annett et al., 1992Annett L.E. Rogers D.C. Hernandez T.D. Dunnett S.B. Behavioural analysis of unilateral monoamine depletion in the marmoset.Brain. 1992; 115: 825-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, Mitchell et al., 1995Mitchell I.J. Hughes N. Carroll C.B. Brotchie J.M. Reversal of parkinsonian symptoms by intrastriatal and systemic manipulations of excitatory amino acid and dopamine transmission in the bilateral 6-OHDA lesioned marmoset.Behav. Pharmacol. 1995; 6: 492-507PubMed Google Scholar), five adult male marmosets were caused to be parkinsonian through 6-OHDA stereotactic micro-injections in the medial forebrain bundle of either one (n = 2) or both hemispheres (n = 3). Injections resulted in neurodegeneration of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons projecting to the forebrain in the lesioned hemispheres, as assessed postmortem through immunohistochemical quantification of tyrosine hydroxylase (Figure S1 available online). In lesioned animals, the number of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain was reduced to 42% ± 23% of the values observed in control animals. In addition, axonal terminal staining density in the caudate-putamen decreased to 44% ± 10% of the levels seen in normal subjects. The severity of parkinsonism was regularly examined in all marmosets using manual scoring of a wide range of clinical signs/deficits (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Movie S1 for details) and automated quantification of spontaneous motor behavior. On average, spontaneous locomotion was reduced to approximately one-fourth of prelesion activity, and PD signs approached the maximum score (mean ± SD: 75% ± 29%) in all the eight categories assessed (Bankiewicz et al., 2001Bankiewicz K.S. Sanchez-Pernaute R. Oiwa Y. Kohutnicka M. Cummins A. Eberling J. Preclinical models of Parkinson’s disease.in: Current Protocols in Neuroscience.

Two new test methods to quantify motor deficits in a marmoset model for Parkinson’s disease.Behav. Brain Res. 2009; 200: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Once PD clinical signs had been confirmed, animals underwent implantation with bipolar epidural SCS electrodes positioned symmetrically over the dorsal midline of the spinal cord at a high thoracic level (T3–T4). Four of the five animals (two with bilateral and two with unilateral medial forebrain bundle lesions) also underwent chronic implantation with microelectrode arrays/bundles in both hemispheres for subsequent recording of neuronal ensemble activity (both single units and local field potentials [LFPs]; Figure S2). These implants targeted multiple structures in each animal, including the primary motor cortex, putamen, the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) and interna, and the ventrolateral and ventral posterolateral thalamic nuclei. In the two unilateral lesion animals, instead of the globus pallidus, parts of primary somatosensory cortex were implanted. Prior to SCS, all animals were also subjected to acute pharmacological inhibition of dopamine synthesis (subcutaneous injections of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine [AMPT] 2 × 240 mg/kg) to further aggravate the PD signs. To avoid SCS current intensities that could be experienced as uncomfortable, before each stimulation session the intensity of each stimulation frequency was adjusted and set to 1.7 times the minimum intensity at which any behavioral response could be consistently detected (small postural changes, head or neck movements). Overall, as previously reported in rodents (Fuentes et al., 2009Fuentes R. Petersson P. Siesser W.B. Caron M.G. Nicolelis M.A.L. Spinal cord stimulation restores locomotion in animal models of Parkinson’s disease.Science. 2009; 323: 1578-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we observed that SCS induced a clear alleviation of motor impairment in monkeys who exhibited severe clinical PD signs. Because the stimulation frequencies used in this study (range, 4–300 Hz) proved equally effective, the analysis of the SCS effects, both behavioral and electrophysiological, were performed by pooling all the frequencies, unless otherwise stated. All recordings/stimulation sessions were performed in freely behaving animals in a transparent acrylic box. Based on our automated image analysis of digital videos obtained from multiple cameras during neuronal recording sessions, SCS induced a 221% increase in general motility of trunk, head, limbs, and tail (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test, Figure 1A), a 192% increase in the frequency of bouts of spontaneous locomotion (p < 0.001, two-proportional z test, Figure 1B), and a 144% increase in the duration of locomotion periods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Figure 1C). These improvements resulted in a 243% increase in the total distance covered (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Figure 1D) by the monkeys. Remarkably, SCS induced a preferential increase in the fraction of faster locomotion components, indicating a specific reduction of bradykinesia, (p < 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of difference in speed histogram distributions, Figure 1E). Overall, the resulting distance covered in locomotive behavior was practically normalized by SCS (on average 91% of intact values, but locomotion differed somewhat in that stimulated animals tended to extend bout duration [628%] whereas reducing the frequency [11%] compared to the intact state). The improvements in motor disability were also assessed by an observer blinded to stimulation conditions that rated specific clinical signs, such as freezing, hypokinesia, bradykinesia, coordination, gait, posture, and gross and fine motor skills, during the OFF and ON periods. The motor deficits that exhibited the highest reduction during SCS were freezing (31%), hypokinesia (23%), posture (23%), and bradykinesia (21%). Overall, the PD score showed, on average, a significant reduction of 18.4% ± 13.9% (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank sum test [including all five subjects], Figure 1F; Figure S1). In addition to the general clinical improvements observed in all monkeys, in a few instances SCS resulted in an extraordinary functional recovery. An example of this is shown in Figure 1G, where a severely parkinsonian animal, who reached the maximum PD score on all clinical signs rated, showed a dramatic improvement during SCS. This allowed the animal to find and retrieve a food item with no difficulty whatsoever (see Movie S2). Chronic, multisite neuronal extracellular activity was analyzed both in terms of changes in single neuron’s firing patterns and at the level of LFPs. We observed that SCS induced changes in neural populations throughout the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loop in parkinsonian animals (Figure 2A). As shown in Figures 2B and 2C, the most noticeable effect was the suppression of LFP power in a frequency interval roughly spanning the beta-band (8–20 Hz), which was abnormally strong in all PD monkeys (respective peak power frequencies for the four subjects were 10, 11, 12, and 15 Hz; Figure S3A; Stein and Bar-Gad, 2013Stein E. Bar-Gad I. β oscillations in the cortico-basal ganglia loop during parkinsonism.Exp. Neurol. 2013; 245: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This suppression of LFP oscillations was observed in all animals and, notably, in all parts of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loop (although it did not reach significance level, p < 0.05, in GPe when comparing averaged power spectra; Figures 2B and 2C, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test on band power 8–20 Hz). In agreement with the behavioral effects, beta suppression could be obtained using both low- and high-frequency SCS paradigms with approximate equal efficacy (average LFP power spectra ON/OFF stimulation for all animals and frequencies are presented in Figure 2B). Next, we examined the effects of SCS on single unit activity. Overall, approximately one-third of the neurons recorded in the lesioned hemispheres displayed significant changes in firing rates associated with SCS. In contrast to the effect on LFP and motor behavior, SCS modulation of neuronal firing rate differed markedly according to the stimulation frequency (Figure 3A; see also Figure S3C). Whereas stimulation at low frequencies (4–20 Hz) caused mostly excitatory neuronal responses, inhibitory firing modulation predominated during high-frequency stimulation (80–300 Hz; Pearson correlation between the ratio of inhibitory/excitatory responses and stimulation frequency was: primary motor cortex, r = 0.96, p < 0.01; putamen, r = 0.74, p < 0.05; ventral posterolateral thalamic nuclei, r = 0.94, p < 0.01; ventrolateral thalamic nuclei, r = 0.76, p < 0.05; subthalamic nucleus, r = 0.92, p < 0.01; GPe and globus pallidus pars interna not significant, Figure 3B). Consistent with the LFP oscillatory activity, we observed a large fraction of neurons with beta oscillatory firing in the OFF period (Figure 3C) that was partially suppressed during the SCS ON period (Figures 3D, 3E, and S2). In total, 152 of 273 (56%) neurons from the lesioned hemispheres displayed significant beta range (8–16 Hz) rhythmic firing patterns during the OFF periods (p < 0.01, as compared to spectra computed from equivalent random spike trains). Of these 152 neurons, 39 (26%) significantly decreased their beta rhythmicity during the SCS ON period. The change in beta power for all units with significant rhythmic activity in the beta range is summarized in Figure 3F. Taken altogether, these data suggest that SCS-induced motor deficit relief is primarily associated with the disruption of synchronized oscillatory activity rather than with specific changes in firing rate. However, because cortico-basal ganglia activity is known to be strongly influenced by behavioral state, neurophysiologic changes could also result, to some extent, from secondary changes in animal motor behavior. Therefore, to further clarify how SCS induces neurophysiologic changes that may cause symptomatic relief, we compared the neuronal activity patterns from the lesioned hemisphere during SCS, in the two hemilesioned animals, to either the patterns of the intact hemisphere or to the lesioned hemisphere following L-DOPA treatment (subcutaneous 15 mg/kg with benserazide 6.25 mg/kg). Recordings were split into 4 s epochs that were classified as either active or inactive states based on automatically quantified motor activity. To facilitate comparisons between states, two separate indices were constructed. First, two vectors were created summarizing the mean differences (parkinsonian versus intact state) and (parkinsonian versus L-DOPA-treated state), respectively, in two multidimensional parameter spaces—spectral LFP power and firing rate per structure. Each recorded epoch could then be represented as a point in the parameter spaces and be quantitatively compared to the intact or L-DOPA treated state by geometrical projection onto these vectors. Using this metric, it was evident that SCS treatment caused a shift toward healthy brain activity patterns resembling the effect of L-DOPA treatment. This effect was observed only for the analysis of LFP spectral power and not for neuronal firing rates (Figure S3B). Importantly, this shift could not be explained as a secondary effect due to an active or inactive behavioral state because a two-way ANOVA, used to estimate the relative effect size of SCS compared to that of behavioral state, showed that only 2.9%and 0.8% of the total variance (eta-squared; using the metric for the intact and L-DOPA treated state, respectively) could be attributed to behavioral state change, whereas the effect of SCS treatment explained 13.4% and 10.8% of the total variance. Consequently, the main effect shared by both SCS and L-DOPA treatment appears to be the suppression of the excessive neuronal population synchronization associated with the parkinsonian state. Although it is not clear how coordinated low-frequency activity patterns arise in PD, it is possible that an altered functional coupling between the circuit elements of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loop may be a key underlying factor (Williams et al., 2002Williams D. Tijssen M. Van Bruggen G. Bosch A. Insola A. Di Lazzaro V. Mazzone P. Oliviero A. Quartarone A. Speelman H. Brown P. Dopamine-dependent changes in the functional connectivity between basal ganglia and cerebral cortex in humans.Brain. 2002; 125: 1558-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). To test this idea, we computed the coherence of the LFP signals between pairs of different neural structures as an indirect measure of their functional connectivity. In the 6-OHDA lesioned dopamine-depleted hemispheres, we found strong coherence between pairs of structures, but only in the parkinsonian low-frequency range (8–15 Hz) (Figure 4A, black traces). Importantly, like the L-DOPA treatment, SCS reduced the beta coherence (Figure 4A red trace), leading to a significant functional decoupling between the different structures. This suggests that SCS brings the functional connectivity of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit closer to the normal state of the intact brain. Indeed, this decoupling of parkinsonian LFP oscillations in the beta band was observed between all the recorded structures and was found to be very similar following L-DOPA and SCS (Figure 4B). To further explore the underlying mechanisms whereby SCS alters network activity, we recorded neural activity while delivering single or pairs of SCS pulses. These recordings showed that primary somatosensory pathways (ventral posterolateral thalamic nuclei and primary somatosensory cortex) are activated early by SCS and that a disruption of beta oscillations through a phase-reset mechanism appears to cause the observed widespread desynchronization in the beta band (Figure S4; Fuentes et al., 2010Fuentes R.

In conclusion, we observed that SCS caused clear clinical improvements in a primate model of PD (comparable to, for example, the reported long-term reduction in UPDRS III score by DBS, ∼28%, Follett et al., 2010Follett K.A. Weaver F.M. Stern M. Hur K. Harris C.L. Luo P. Marks Jr., W.J. Rothlind J. Sagher O. Moy C. et al.CSP 468 Study GroupPallidal versus subthalamic deep-brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease.N.

These include deficits in posture, gait, and speed of locomotion (Krack et al., 2003Krack P. Batir A. Van Blercom N. Chabardes S. Fraix V. Ardouin C. Koudsie A. Limousin P.D. Benazzouz A.

Med. 2003; 349: 1925-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). Concurrent multisite neuronal recordings showed that significant behavioral improvements induced by SCS were strongly associated with desynchronization of neuronal activity within the cortico-basal ganglia circuitry and reduction in beta-frequency coherence between structure pairs. We therefore propose that SCS should be further tested in clinical studies aimed at measuring its long-term efficacy as a less invasive, long-term therapy for patients with PD. Five adult male common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) 300–550 g were used in the study. The animals were housed in pairs in cages (1.0 × 1.0 × 2.3 m) in a vivarium with a natural light cycle (12/12 hr) and outdoor temperature. All animal procedures were carried out according to approved protocols by AASDAP Ethics Committee and strictly in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications no. 80-23). This project was approved by SISBIO/Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural Resources under no. 20795-2. Neurotoxic lesions were inflicted with the animals under deep anesthesia. Two microliters of 6-OHDA solution (4 mg/ml, 0.05% ascorbic acid, saline) were injected into the medial forebrain bundle in (AP/ML/DV): 6.5/1.2/6.0; 6.5/1.2/7.0; 6.5/2.2/6.5; 6.5/2.2/7.5; and 6.5/3.2/8.0 (Annett et al., 1992Annett L.E.

https://openalex.org/W2036034523,"Inhibitory neurotransmission in amygdala is important for fear learning and memory. However, mechanisms that control the inhibitory activity in amygdala are not well understood. We provide evidence that neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptor ErbB4 tyrosine kinase are critical for maintaining GABAergic activity in amygdala. Neutralizing endogenous NRG1, inhibition, or genetic ablation of ErbB4, which was expressed in a majority of palvalbumin (PV)+ neurons in amygdala, reduced GABAergic transmission and inhibited tone-cued fear conditioning. Specific ablation of ErbB4 in PV+ neurons reduced eIPSC/eEPSC ratios and impaired fear conditioning. Notably, expression of ErbB4 in amygdala was sufficient to diminish synaptic dysfunction and fear conditioning deficits in PV-ErbB4-/- mice. These observations indicated that NRG1 signaling maintains high GABAergic activity in amygdala and, thus, regulates fear memory. Considering that both NRG1 and ErbB4 are susceptibility genes of schizophrenia, our study sheds light on potential pathophysiological mechanisms of this disorder."

https://openalex.org/W2004228890,"Presynaptic resting Ca(2+) influences synaptic vesicle (SV) release probability. Here, we report that a TRPV channel, Inactive (Iav), maintains presynaptic resting [Ca(2+)] by promoting Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum in Drosophila motor neurons, and is required for both synapse development and neurotransmission. We find that Iav activates the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, which is essential for presynaptic microtubule stabilization at the neuromuscular junction. Thus, loss of Iav induces destabilization of presynaptic microtubules, resulting in diminished synaptic growth. Interestingly, expression of human TRPV1 in Iav-deficient motor neurons rescues these defects. We also show that the absence of Iav causes lower SV release probability and diminished synaptic transmission, whereas Iav overexpression elevates these synaptic parameters. Together, our findings indicate that Iav acts as a key regulator of synaptic development and function by influencing presynaptic resting [Ca(2+)]."
https://openalex.org/W2037824079,"BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1), which is frequently mutated in cancer, functions as a deubiquitinase (DUB) for histone H2A. Although BAP1 interacts with a transcriptional regulator, HCF-1, and transcription factors FoxK1 and FoxK2, how BAP1 controls gene expression remains unclear. This study investigates the importance of BAP1 DUB activity and the interactions with FoxK2 and HCF-1 in the regulation of FoxK2 target genes. We show that FoxK2 recruits BAP1 to the target genes through the forkhead-associated domain, which interacts with Thr(P)-493 on BAP1. BAP1, in turn, recruits HCF-1, thereby forming a ternary complex in which BAP1 bridges FoxK2 and HCF-1. BAP1 represses FoxK2 target genes, and this effect requires BAP1 DUB activity but not interaction with HCF-1. Importantly, BAP1 depletion causes up-regulation of FoxK2 target genes only in the presence of the Ring1B-Bmi1 complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase for histone H2A, indicating an antagonizing role of BAP1 against Ring1B-Bmi1. Our findings suggest that BAP1 deficiency causes increased expression of target genes in a Ring1B-Bmi1-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2020685534,Tumorigenesis is a dynamic biological process that involves distinct cancer cell subpopulations proliferating at different rates and interconverting between them. In this paper we proposed a mathematical framework of population dynamics that considers both distinctive growth rates and intercellular transitions between cancer cell populations. Our mathematical framework showed that both growth and transition influence the ratio of cancer cell subpopulations but the latter is more significant. We derived the condition that different cancer cell types can maintain distinctive subpopulations and we also explain why there always exists a stable fixed ratio after cell sorting based on putative surface markers. The cell fraction ratio can be shifted by changing either the growth rates of the subpopulations (Darwinism selection) or by environment-instructed transitions (Lamarckism induction). This insight can help us to understand the dynamics of the heterogeneity of cancer cells and lead us to new strategies to overcome cancer drug resistance.

In Drosophila, age-related impairments in 1 hr memory can be suppressed by reducing activity of protein kinase A (PKA). However, the mechanism for this effect has been unclear. Here we show that decreasing PKA suppresses AMI by reducing activity of pyruvate carboxylase (PC), a glial metabolic enzyme whose amounts increase upon aging. Increased PC activity causes AMI through a mechanism independent of oxidative damage. Instead, increased PC activity is associated with decreases in D-serine, a glia-derived neuromodulator that regulates NMDA receptor activity. D-serine feeding suppresses both AMI and memory impairment caused by glial overexpression of dPC, indicating that an oxidative stress-independent dysregulation of glial modulation of neuronal activity contributes to AMI in Drosophila.

Various mechanisms have been proposed to cause age-related memory impairment (AMI), including increases in mitochondrial dysfunction, decreases in insulin/IGF signaling, decreases in autophagy and protein turnover, and alterations in expression of genes involved in neuronal function and stress-response pathways (Bishop et al., 2010Bishop N.A.

Most of these mechanisms are thought to occur as a consequence of an initial age-dependent increase or accumulation of oxidative damage. However, while methods of reducing oxidative damage have been reported to increase lifespan (Sampayo et al., 2003Sampayo J.N. Gill M.S. Lithgow G.J.

However, the identification of pathways and genes causing AMI has been hindered by the difficulty of distinguishing age-associated changes in general from those specific to AMI. In Drosophila, AMI consists of defects in transcription-independent middle-term memory (MTM), which can be measured 1 hr after training (Horiuchi and Saitoe, 2005Horiuchi J. Saitoe M.

Aging and its differential effects on consolidated memory forms in Drosophila.Exp. Gerontol. 2007; 42: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that age-related impairments in 1 hr memory are suppressed by heterozygous mutations in the DC0 (DC0/+) gene, which encodes the major catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (Yamazaki et al., 2007Yamazaki D. Horiuchi J. Nakagami Y. Nagano S. Tamura T. Saitoe M. The Drosophila DCO mutation suppresses age-related memory impairment without affecting lifespan.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 478-484PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, decreasing PKA activity in the mushroom bodies (MBs), neural centers essential for forming associative olfactory memories, at old ages reverses this impairment, while increasing PKA activity in the MBs at young ages causes premature impairment (Yamazaki et al., 2010Yamazaki D. Horiuchi J. Miyashita T. Saitoe M. Acute inhibition of PKA activity at old ages ameliorates age-related memory impairment in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15573-15577Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In mammals, an age-dependent decline in prefrontal cortex-dependent working memory is ameliorated by infusing PKA inhibitors and enhanced by infusing a PKA activator, demonstrating that PKA’s role in AMI may be conserved (Ramos et al., 2003Ramos B.P. Birnbaum S.G. Lindenmayer I. Newton S.S. Duman R.S. Arnsten A.F. Dysregulation of protein kinase a signaling in the aged prefrontal cortex: new strategy for treating age-related cognitive decline.Neuron. 2003; 40: 835-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, amounts of cAMP and activity of PKA do not increase upon aging, suggesting that there are likely to be other genes that show age-related changes in activity and cause AMI through a PKA-dependent mechanism. DC0/+ mutations suppress AMI without changing lifespan (Yamazaki et al., 2007Yamazaki D. Horiuchi J. Nakagami Y. Nagano S. Tamura T. Saitoe M. The Drosophila DCO mutation suppresses age-related memory impairment without affecting lifespan.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 478-484PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that AMI-associated proteins might be found by identifying differences between age-related changes in protein expression in wild-type flies and DC0/+ mutants. Using proteome analysis, we identified the Drosophila homolog of pyruvate carboxylase (dPC) as a protein whose expression is increased upon aging and is decreased in DC0/+ mutants. PC is a mitochondrial anaplerotic enzyme that carboxylates pyruvate to form oxaloacetate (OAA) and is expressed in glial cells in the mammalian brain (Hertz et al., 2007Hertz L. Peng L. Dienel G.A.

Although lack of PC activity causes lactic acidosis, which leads to mental retardation and early death during childhood in humans (García-Cazorla et al., 2006García-Cazorla A. Rabier D. Touati G.

Pediatr. 1976; 22: 267-303PubMed Google Scholar), our current study demonstrates that an age-related increase in dPC activity in glial cells is a cause of AMI in Drosophila. This increase does not occur as a response to oxidative damage, suggesting that an alternative pathway causing dysregulation of glia modulation of neuronal activity may be a cause of AMI. Age-related impairments in 1 hr memory occur within 20 days of age in wild-type but not in Pka-C1 heterozygous (DCOB3/+) flies (Yamazaki et al., 2007Yamazaki D. Horiuchi J. Nakagami Y. Nagano S. Tamura T. Saitoe M. The Drosophila DCO mutation suppresses age-related memory impairment without affecting lifespan.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 478-484PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to identify potential AMI-associated proteins, we searched for proteins that showed altered expression upon aging to 20 days in a wild-type background and a shift toward young expression in 20-day-old DCOB3/+ flies compared to 20-day-old wild-type flies. We performed this screen using fluorescence-based two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) (Jiang et al., 2010Jiang L. Fang J. Moore D.S. Gogichaeva N.V. Galeva N.A. Michaelis M.L. Zaidi A. Age-associated changes in synaptic lipid raft proteins revealed by two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis.Neurobiol. Aging. 2010; 31: 2146-2159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We screened for protein spots that showed a more than 1.5-fold change in spot intensity and found 91 differences between young and aged wild-type flies (n = 3, Figure S1A available online), 94 differences between young and aged DCOB3/+ flies (n = 3, Figure S1B), and 9 differences between aged wild-type and aged DCOB3/+ flies (n = 3, Figure S1C). Among these differences, one cluster of three spots (open arrowheads in Figures S1A–S1C) consistently showed intensities that increased upon aging but were lower in 20-day-old DCOB3/+ flies compared to 20-day-old wild-type flies. Using mass spectroscopy, we determined that all spots in this cluster are derived from the CG1516 gene (http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0027580.html). The principal phenotype of AMI in wild-type flies after single-cycle olfactory conditioning is a specific reduction in middle-term memory (MTM), characteristically measured 1 hr after single-cycle olfactory conditioning (Tamura et al., 2003Tamura T. Chiang A.S. Ito N. Liu H.P. Horiuchi J. Tully T. Saitoe M.

USA. 2012; 109: 6319-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine whether CG1516 is associated with AMI, we assayed 1 hr memory in young and old CG1516 mutants after single-cycle training. We identified two fly lines, EP2547 and CB0292-3, which have P element transposon insertions in CG1516 (Figure 1A). Homozygous EP2547 and CB0292-3 flies are semilethal and express significantly reduced amounts of CG1516 product (Figure 1B). They also have severe reductions in 1 hr memory but normal task-related sensorimotor responses (Figures S2A–S2C). Heterozygous EP2547/+ and CB0292-3/+ flies are viable, express reduced amounts of CG1516 product (Figure 1B), and have normal or near normal 1 hr memory at young ages. Significantly, both heterozygous lines showed suppression of AMI compared to wild-type flies (Figures 1C and 1D), with no extension of lifespan (Figures S2D and S2E). In addition, memory retention curves of aged EP2547/+ and CB0292-3/+ flies were not significantly different from young flies (Figures 1E and 1F). Based on sequence similarity, CG1516 is predicted to encode Drosophila pyruvate carboxylase (dPC) (Figure 2A). In humans, PC deficiency is associated with severe mental retardation (García-Cazorla et al., 2006García-Cazorla A. Rabier D. Touati G. Chadefaux-Vekemans B. Marsac C. de Lonlay P. Saudubray J.M. Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency: metabolic characteristics and new neurological aspects.Ann. Neurol. 2006; 59: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Israels et al., 1976Israels S. Haworth J.C. Dunn H.G. Applegarth D.A. Lactic acidosis in childhood.Adv. Pediatr. 1976; 22: 267-303PubMed Google Scholar), a phenotype consistent with what we observed in homozygous EP2547 and CB0292-3 flies (Figure S2A). PC catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetic acid (OAA) in mitochondria and is exclusively expressed in glial cells in the mammalian brain (Hertz et al., 2007Hertz L. Peng L. Dienel G.A. Energy metabolism in astrocytes: high rate of oxidative metabolism and spatiotemporal dependence on glycolysis/glycogenolysis.J. Cereb.

Pyruvate carboxylase: an astrocyte-specific enzyme implicated in the replenishment of amino acid neurotransmitter pools.Brain Res. 1985; 329: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). OAA is further converted to malate by malate dehydrogenase (MDH) in a reaction that reduces NADH (Modak and Kelly, 1995Modak H.V. Kelly D.J. Acetyl-CoA-dependent pyruvate carboxylase from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus: rapid and efficient purification using dye-ligand affinity chromatography.Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, to test whether CG1516 encodes dPC, we expressed a C-terminal myc-tagged CG1516 transgene in glial cells of flies, using a glial-specific repo-GAL4 driver (Xiong et al., 1994Xiong W.C. Okano H. Patel N.H. Blendy J.A. Montell C. repo encodes a glial-specific homeo domain protein required in the Drosophila nervous system.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and measured the ability of myc-antibody immunoprecipitates to reduce NADH in the presence of MDH (Modak and Kelly, 1995Modak H.V. Kelly D.J. Acetyl-CoA-dependent pyruvate carboxylase from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus: rapid and efficient purification using dye-ligand affinity chromatography.Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Anti-myc antibody immunoprecipitates exhibited robust NADH reduction activity in a complete assay mixture (see Experimental Procedures for details), whereas immunoprecipitates using control anti-tubulin antibody did not (Figure 2B). NADH was not reduced by anti-myc immunoprecipitates in the absence of the substrate pyruvate or ATP. Moreover, NADH reduction was also greatly inhibited in the absence of NaHCO3 (a source of CO2). These results indicate that CG1516 probably encodes dPC, and we confirmed that amounts of CG1516 gene product, hereafter referred to as dPC, increases significantly upon aging (Figure 2C). We further demonstrated that heterozygous dPCEP2547/+ and dPCCB0292-3/+ mutations reduce dPC activity (Figure 2D). Mammalian PC is expressed in astrocytes but not in neurons (Hertz et al., 2007Hertz L. Peng L. Dienel G.A.

Blood Flow Metab. 2007; 27: 219-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, Shank et al., 1985Shank R.P. Bennett G.S. Freytag S.O. Campbell G.L. Pyruvate carboxylase: an astrocyte-specific enzyme implicated in the replenishment of amino acid neurotransmitter pools.Brain Res. 1985; 329: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). To determine whether dPC is also located in glia, we used a mitochondrially targeted GFP construct, mito-GFP (Pilling et al., 2006Pilling A.D. Horiuchi D. Lively C.M. Saxton W.M. Kinesin-1 and Dynein are the primary motors for fast transport of mitochondria in Drosophila motor axons.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), expressed from a glial-specific repo-GAL4 driver, to visualize glial mitochondria. As shown in Figure 3A, GFP signals are observed in a punctate pattern surrounding neuropil regions. We observed an overlapping pattern when we probed with anti-dPC antibodies (Figures 3B and 3C). Although we also observed some dPC signals in neuropil regions including the calyx, these signals remained unchanged in a dPCEP2547/dPCCB0292-3 background, suggesting that they are nonspecific (Figures S3A, S3B, and S3C). In contrast, glial signals were abolished in a dPCEP2547/dPCCB0292-3 background. We further demonstrated that dPCMI02451 flies, which carry a MiMIC transposon (a Minos-mediated integration cassette including a GFP transgene) (Venken et al., 2011Venken K.J. Schulze K.L. Haelterman N.A. Pan H. He Y. Evans-Holm M. Carlson J.W. Levis R.W. Spradling A.C. Hoskins R.A. Bellen H.J. MiMIC: a highly versatile transposon insertion resource for engineering Drosophila melanogaster genes.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) in the dPC locus, also show GFP signals predominantly in glia (Figures S3D, S3E, and S3F). To test whether glial dPC is responsible for AMI, we expressed a dPC transgene (dPC+) using two glial drivers, repo-GAL4 and nrv2-GAL4, and found that AMI was restored in a dPCEP2547/+ background (Figure 3D). In contrast, neuronal expression of dPC+ from an elav-GAL4 driver had no effect on AMI. Using an RU486-inducible glial geneswitch driver, we further demonstrated that glial dPC activity at the adult stage, but not the larval stage, restores AMI in this background (Figure 3E). Moreover, 3 day feeding of RU486 specifically to old GliaGS > UAS-dPC+;dPCEP2547/+ flies restores AMI (Figure 3E), suggesting that acute increases in dPC are sufficient to induce AMI. If increased glial dPC activity causes AMI, overexpressing dPC+ in glia may prematurely disrupt 1 hr memory in young flies. Young repo-GAL4>UAS-dPC+ and nrv2-GAL4>UAS-dPC+ flies had severely reduced 1 hr memory compared with young wild-type flies (Figure 3F). In contrast, overexpressing dPC+ either panneuronally or in the MBs did not affect memory. Neither initial learning, which was assayed immediately after training, nor 7 hr memory were affected in either repo-GAL4 > UAS-dPC+ or nrv2-GAL4>UAS-dPC+ flies (Figures S3G and S3H), suggesting that increasing dPC activity in glial cells specifically disrupts the memory phase affected in AMI. Consistent with this idea, aging did not further exacerbate the reduction in 1 hr memory observed in repo-GAL4>UAS-dPC+ and nrv2-GAL4>UAS-dPC+ flies, indicating that increasing amounts of glial dPC functions to occlude AMI (Figure S3I). Overexpression of DC0+ in the MBs causes a premature reduction in 1 hr memory (Yamazaki et al., 2007Yamazaki D. Horiuchi J. Nakagami Y. Nagano S. Tamura T. Saitoe M. The Drosophila DCO mutation suppresses age-related memory impairment without affecting lifespan.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 478-484PubMed Google Scholar). We found that this reduction does not occur in a dPC heterozygous background (Figure 4A). Further, AMI is restored in DC0/+ flies by overexpressing dPC+ in glia (Figure 4B). In combination with our 2D data, these results indicate that neuronal PKA affects AMI by regulating amounts of glial dPC. Interestingly, although the overexpression of dPC+ in glia in a wild-type background disrupts memory at a young age (Figure 3F), this disruption is not observed in young flies from a DC0B3/+ background (Figure 4B), suggesting that the reductions in endogenous dPC in DC0B3/+ flies can suppress the deleterious effects of glial dPC+ overexpression. Consistent with this idea, we found an approximately 2-fold decrease in dPC amounts in DC0/+ flies (Figure 4C). While dPC activity increases similarly upon aging in both wild-type and DC0B3/+ flies (an ∼2.5-fold increase, Figure 4D), it is reduced equally (>2-fold) in both young and old DC0B3/+ flies, suggesting that reduced PKA suppresses AMI by decreasing dPC activity in an age-independent manner. Although it is unclear whether suppression of AMI by DC0 mutations involves the oxidative stress pathway, cumulative damage from oxidative stress is proposed to be a central cause of AMI (Bishop et al., 2010Bishop N.A.

Extracellular superoxide dismutase overexpression protects against aging-induced cognitive impairment in mice.Behav. Genet. 2002; 32: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that increases in dPC amounts could be caused by increased age-associated oxidative damage. However, we found that feeding flies the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating agent paraquat (PQ) at a concentration sufficient to kill ∼50% of flies and increase expression of the oxidative stress marker, heat-shock protein 22 (hsp22) >100-fold in fly heads (King and Tower, 1999King V. Tower J. Aging-specific expression of Drosophila hsp22.Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, Landis et al., 2004Landis G.N. Abdueva D. Skvortsov D. Yang J. Rabin B.E. Carrick J. Tavaré S. Tower J. Similar gene expression patterns characterize aging and oxidative stress in Drosophila melanogaster.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 7663-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) (Figure S4A), had no effect on dPC amounts (Figure S4B). A previous report has shown that brain functions may be protected from oxidative damage by a defense system against ROSs (Hirano et al., 2012Hirano Y. Kuriyama Y. Miyashita T. Horiuchi J. Saitoe M. Reactive oxygen species are not involved in the onset of age-related memory impairment in Drosophila.Genes Brain Behav. 2012; 11: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, to study the relationship between ROSs, AMI, and dPC further, we artificially increased damage from oxidative stress by weakening this defense system using nrv2-Gal4>UAS-sod1-IR flies, in which sod1, the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1, is knocked down in glia. Although nrv2-Gal4>UAS-sod1-IR flies have normal 1 hr memory immediately after eclosion (1 day old), memory is disrupted at 5 days of age (Figure 5A), with a concomitant increase in hsp22 expression (Figure 5B). However, dPC amounts are unaltered (Figure 5C), and the dPCEP2547/+ mutation does not ameliorate disrupted memory in these flies (Figure 5D). Knocking down sod1 in neurons using elav-Gal4>UAS-sod1-IR flies similarly disrupted 1 hr memory in 10-day-old, but not 1-day-old, flies (Figure S4C). Again, however, amounts of dPC protein are unaltered upon neuronal knockdown of sod1 (Figure S4D), and the dPCEP2547/+ mutation does not ameliorate disrupted memory in these flies (Figure S4E). These results suggest that AMI and memory loss due to increasing oxidative damage occur through distinct mechanisms. Supporting this idea, the memory defects caused by overexpression of dPC+ in glia (Figure 3F) are not associated with increased hsp22 expression (Figure 5E). Further, nrv2-Gal4 > UAS-dPC+ flies have normal anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM), similar to aged wild-type flies (Tamura et al., 2003Tamura T. Chiang A.S. Ito N. Liu H.P. Horiuchi J. Tully T. Saitoe M. Aging specifically impairs amnesiac-dependent memory in Drosophila.Neuron. 2003; 40: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), while nrv2>sod1-IR flies have defective ARM (Figure 5F), indicating that increasing oxidative damage affects a broader range of memory phases compared to AMI. If increased dPC activity and AMI are not associated with increased oxidative damage, how does an increase in dPC activity disrupt memory? PC activity produces OAA, which can be converted to aspartic acid (Asp) by mitochondrial aspartate transaminase (m-AST). Both OAA and Asp are potent competitive inhibitors of serine racemase (SR) (Dunlop and Neidle, 2005Dunlop D.S. Neidle A. Regulation of serine racemase activity by amino acids.Brain Res. Mol.

Since D-serine functions as a coactivator of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) (Henneberger et al., 2010Henneberger C. Papouin T. Oliet S.H. Rusakov D.A.

To test this, we measured the ratio of D-serine to L-serine (D/L ratio) in fly brain extracts and determined that this ratio decreased significantly upon aging in wild-type flies, while it remained high in both aged dPCEP2547/+ and DC0B3/+ flies (Figure 6A). In contrast, glial overexpression of a dPC+ transgene (Figure 6B) and neuronal overexpression of DC0+ (Figure 6A), caused a decrease in the D/L ratio in young flies. Thus, the D/L ratio is high in young flies and in old flies with ameliorated AMI, while it is low in old flies and in young flies with accelerated AMI.

The secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects of LGG on the gastrointestinal microbiome, host immune response and plasma cytokines.Fifteen elderly volunteers, aged 66-80 years received LGG capsules containing 1×1010 CFU, twice daily for 28 days and were followed through day 56. Volunteers completed a daily diary, a telephone call on study days 3, 7 and 14 and study visits in the Clinical Research Center at baseline, day 28 and day 56 to determine whether adverse events had occurred. Assessments included prompted and open-ended questions.There were no serious adverse events. The 15 volunteers had a total of 47 events (range 1-7 per volunteer), 39 (83%) of which were rated as mild and 40% of which were considered related to consuming LGG. Thirty-one (70%) of the events were expected, prompted symptoms while 16 were unexpected events. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (bloating, gas, and nausea), 27 rated as mild and 3 rated as moderate.

https://openalex.org/W2023611264,"EphrinAs and EphAs play critical roles during topographic map formation in the retinocollicular projection; however, their complex expression patterns in both the retina and superior colliculus (SC) have made it difficult to uncover their precise mechanisms of action. We demonstrate here that growth cones of temporal axons collapse when contacting nasal axons in vitro, and removing ephrinAs from axonal membranes by PI-PLC treatment abolishes this response. In conditional knockout mice, temporal axons display no major targeting defects when ephrinA5 is removed only from the SC, but substantial mapping defects were observed when ephrinA5 expression was removed from both the SC and from the retina, with temporal axons invading the target areas of nasal axons. Together, these data indicate that ephrinA5 drives repellent interactions between temporal and nasal axons within the SC, and demonstrates for the first time that target-independent mechanisms play an essential role in retinocollicular map formation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2083655395,"Kidney disease is emerging as an arsenic (As)-linked disease outcome, however further evidence of this association is warranted. Our first objective for this paper was to examine the potential renal toxicity of As exposure in Bangladesh. Our second objective relates to examining whether the previously reported positive association between urinary creatinine (uCrn) and As methylation may be explained by renal function. We had hypothesized that these associations relate to supply and demand for s-adenosylmethionine, the methyl donor for both creatine synthesis and As methylation. Alternatively, renal function could influence both As and creatinine excretion, or the As metabolites may influence renal function, which in turn influences uCrn. We conducted a cross-sectional study (N = 478) of adults, composed of a sample recruited in 2001 and a sample recruited in 2003. We assessed renal function using plasma cystatin C, and calculated the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Consistent with renal toxicity of As, log-uAs had a marginal inverse association with eGFR in the 2003 sample (b = -5.6, p = 0.07), however this association was not significant in the 2001 sample (b = -1.9, p = 0.24). Adjustment for eGFR did not alter the associations between uCrn and the %uAs metabolites, indicating that GFR does not explain these associations. Increased eGFR was associated with increased odds of having %uInAs >12.2% (2001: OR = 1.01, 95%CI (1.00,1.03); 2003: OR = 1.04, 95%CI (1.01,1.07)). In the 2003 sample only, there was a negative association between eGFR and %uDMA (b = -0.08, p = 0.02). These results may indicate differential effects of renal function on excretion of InAs and DMA. Alternatively, a certain methylation pattern, involving decreased %InAs and increased %DMA, may reduce renal function. Given that these studies were cross-sectional, we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. Discrepancies between the samples may be due to the higher As exposure, poorer nutrition, and lower As methylation capacity in the 2003 sample."
https://openalex.org/W2048748690,"The antibiotic fusidic acid (FA) targets elongation factor G (EF-G) and inhibits ribosomal peptide elongation and ribosome recycling, but deeper mechanistic aspects of FA action have remained unknown. Using quench flow and stopped flow experiments in a biochemical system for protein synthesis and taking advantage of separate time scales for inhibited (10 s) and uninhibited (100 ms) elongation cycles, a detailed kinetic model of FA action was obtained. FA targets EF-G at an early stage in the translocation process (I), which proceeds unhindered by the presence of the drug to a later stage (II), where the ribosome stalls. Stalling may also occur at a third stage of translocation (III), just before release of EF-G from the post-translocation ribosome. We show that FA is a strong elongation inhibitor (K50% ≈ 1 μm), discuss the identity of the FA targeted states, and place existing cryo-EM and crystal structures in their functional context."
https://openalex.org/W2034533222,"Short-term memory can be defined as the capacity for holding a small amount of information in mind in an active state for a short period of time. Although some instruments have been developed to study spatial short-term memory in real environments, there are no instruments that are specifically designed to assess visuospatial short-term memory in an attractive way to children. In this paper, we present the ARSM (Augmented Reality Spatial Memory) task, the first Augmented Reality task that involves a user's movement to assess spatial short-term memory in healthy children. The experimental procedure of the ARSM task was designed to assess the children's skill to retain visuospatial information. They were individually asked to remember the real place where augmented reality objects were located. The children (N = 76) were divided into two groups: preschool (5–6 year olds) and primary school (7–8 year olds). We found a significant improvement in ARSM task performance in the older group. The correlations between scores for the ARSM task and traditional procedures were significant. These traditional procedures were the Dot Matrix subtest for the assessment of visuospatial short-term memory of the computerized AWMA-2 battery and a parent's questionnaire about a child's everyday spatial memory. Hence, we suggest that the ARSM task has high verisimilitude with spatial short-term memory skills in real life. In addition, we evaluated the ARSM task's usability and perceived satisfaction. The study revealed that the younger children were more satisfied with the ARSM task. This novel instrument could be useful in detecting visuospatial short-term difficulties that affect specific developmental navigational disorders and/or school academic achievement."
https://openalex.org/W2150167921,"Tracing microtubule centerlines in serial section electron tomography requires microtubules to be stitched across sections, that is lines from different sections need to be aligned, endpoints need to be matched at section boundaries to establish a correspondence between neighboring sections, and corresponding lines need to be connected across multiple sections. We present computational methods for these tasks: 1) An initial alignment is computed using a distance compatibility graph. 2) A fine alignment is then computed with a probabilistic variant of the iterative closest points algorithm, which we extended to handle the orientation of lines by introducing a periodic random variable to the probabilistic formulation. 3) Endpoint correspondence is established by formulating a matching problem in terms of a Markov random field and computing the best matching with belief propagation. Belief propagation is not generally guaranteed to converge to a minimum. We show how convergence can be achieved, nonetheless, with minimal manual input. In addition to stitching microtubule centerlines, the correspondence is also applied to transform and merge the electron tomograms. We applied the proposed methods to samples from the mitotic spindle in C. elegans, the meiotic spindle in X. laevis, and sub-pellicular microtubule arrays in T. brucei. The methods were able to stitch microtubules across section boundaries in good agreement with experts' opinions for the spindle samples. Results, however, were not satisfactory for the microtubule arrays. For certain experiments, such as an analysis of the spindle, the proposed methods can replace manual expert tracing and thus enable the analysis of microtubules over long distances with reasonable manual effort."

Abnormal expression and/or dysfunction of NEK8 are related to cancer development and progression. However, the mechanisms that regulate NEK8 are not well declared. We demonstrated here that pVHL may be involved in regulating NEK8. We found that CAK-I cells with wild-type vhl expressed a lower level of NEK8 than the cells loss of vhl, such as 786-O, 769-P, and A-498 cells. Moreover, pVHL overexpression down-regulated the NEK8 protein in 786-O cells, whereas pVHL knockdown up-regulated NEK8 in CAK-I cells. In addition, we found that the positive hypoxia response elements (HREs) are located in the promoter of the nek8 sequence and hypoxia could induce nek8 expression in different cell types. Consistent with this, down-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors α (HIF-1α or HIF-2α) by isoform-specific siRNA reduced the ability of hypoxia inducing nek8 expression. In vivo, NEK8 and HIF-1α expression were increased in kidneys of rats subjected to an experimental hypoxia model of ischemia and reperfusion. Furthermore, NEK8 siRNA transfection significantly blocked pVHL-knockdown-induced cilia disassembling, through impairing the pVHL-knockdown-up-regulated NEK8 expression.

Human corin has 19 predicted N-glycosylation sites in its extracellular domains. It has been shown that N-glycans are required for corin cell surface expression and zymogen activation. It remains unknown, however, how N-glycans at different sites may regulate corin biosynthesis and processing. In this study, we examined corin mutants, in which each of the 19 predicted N-glycosylation sites was mutated individually. By Western analysis of corin proteins in cell lysate and conditioned medium from transfected HEK293 cells and HL-1 cardiomyocytes, we found that N-glycosylation at Asn-80 inhibited corin shedding in the juxtamembrane domain. Similarly, N-glycosylation at Asn-231 protected corin from autocleavage in the frizzled-1 domain. Moreover, N-glycosylation at Asn-697 in the scavenger receptor domain and at Asn-1022 in the protease domain is important for corin cell surface targeting and zymogen activation.

https://openalex.org/W2069088966,"CYP3A4 is an abundant and catalytically dominant human liver endoplasmic reticulum-anchored cytochrome P450 enzyme engaged in the biotransformation of endo- and xenobiotics, including >50% of clinically relevant drugs. Alterations of CYP3A4 protein turnover can influence clinically relevant drug metabolism and bioavailability and drug-drug interactions. This CYP3A4 turnover involves endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation via the ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent 26 S proteasomal system that relies on two highly complementary E2 Ub-conjugating-E3 Ub-ligase (UBC7-gp78 and UbcH5a-C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP)-Hsc70-Hsp40) complexes, as well as protein kinases (PK) A and C. We have documented that CYP3A4 Ser/Thr phosphorylation (Ser(P)/Thr(P)) by PKA and/or PKC accelerates/enhances its Lys ubiquitination by either of these E2-E3 systems. Intriguingly, CYP3A4 Ser(P)/Thr(P) and ubiquitinated Lys residues reside within the cytosol-accessible surface loop and/or conformationally assembled acidic Asp/Glu clusters, leading us to propose that such post-translational Ser/Thr protein phosphorylation primes CYP3A4 for ubiquitination. Herein, this possibility was examined through various complementary approaches, including site-directed mutagenesis, chemical cross-linking, peptide mapping, and LC-MS/MS analyses. Our findings reveal that such CYP3A4 Asp/Glu/Ser(P)/Thr(P) surface clusters are indeed important for its intermolecular electrostatic interactions with each of these E2-E3 subcomponents. By imparting additional negative charge to these Asp/Glu clusters, such Ser/Thr phosphorylation would generate P450 phosphodegrons for molecular recognition by the E2-E3 complexes, thereby controlling the timing of CYP3A4 ubiquitination and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. Although the importance of phosphodegrons in the CHIP targeting of its substrates is known, to our knowledge this is the first example of phosphodegron involvement in gp78-substrate recruitment, an important step in CYP3A4 proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2094823192,"Despite extensive study, how retinal enters and exits the visual G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin remains unclear. One clue may lie in two openings between transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) and TM7 and between TM5 and TM6 in the active receptor structure. Recently, retinal has been proposed to enter the inactive apoprotein opsin (ops) through these holes when the receptor transiently adopts the active opsin conformation (ops*). Here, we directly test this “transient activation” hypothesis using a fluorescence-based approach to measure rates of retinal binding to samples containing differing relative fractions of ops and ops*. In contrast to what the transient activation hypothesis model would predict, we found that binding for the inverse agonist, 11-cis-retinal (11CR), slowed when the sample contained more ops* (produced using M257Y, a constitutively activating mutation). Interestingly, the increased presence of ops* allowed for binding of the agonist, all-trans-retinal (ATR), whereas WT opsin showed no binding. Shifting the conformational equilibrium toward even more ops* using a G protein peptide mimic (either free in solution or fused to the receptor) accelerated the rate of ATR binding and slowed 11CR binding. An arrestin peptide mimic showed little effect on 11CR binding; however, it stabilized opsin·ATR complexes. The TM5/TM6 hole is apparently not involved in this conformational selection. Increasing its size by mutagenesis did not enable ATR binding but instead slowed 11CR binding, suggesting that it may play a role in trapping 11CR. In summary, our results indicate that conformational selection dictates stable retinal binding, which we propose involves ATR and 11CR binding to different states, the latter a previously unidentified, open-but-inactive conformation.

The molecular basis of visual excitation.Nature. 1968; 219: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Protonation of this linkage shifts the absorbance of the ligand from the ultraviolet (380 nm) to the visible spectrum (500 nm). The 11CR acts as an inverse agonist that quenches basal signaling by trapping the receptor in an inactive conformation. Light absorption causes isomerization of the 11CR to all-trans-retinal (ATR) (see Fig. 1 for ligand structures), which acts as an agonist and induces a series of conformational changes that ultimately push the receptor to the active, G protein-coupling conformation called metarhodopsin II (MII) (2.Farrens D.L.

The only structure of retinal-free rhodopsin, opsin, currently available most likely does not reflect the “true” inactive opsin state in solution as it has numerous elements of the open active conformation, including the holes, and a root mean square deviation from MII rhodopsin of only ∼0.4 Å (14.Park J.H.

Biochemical and spectroscopic studies indicate that opsin in solution is more structurally similar to the closed, inactive 11CR-bound rhodopsin (6.Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D.

This conundrum (that 11CR is bound in the binding pocket of the closed, inactive receptor, but there is no clear way for it to get there) has led to the proposal that the empty state opsin must enter a transient open and active conformation (ops*) for the 11CR to gain access to the binding pocket (21.Piechnick R. Ritter E. Hildebrand P.W. Ernst O.P. Scheerer P. Hofmann K.P. Heck M. Effect of channel mutations on the uptake and release of the retinal ligand in opsin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 5247-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1C). Evidence supporting this “transient activation” hypothesis include whole-cell electrophysiology experiments that show a brief increase in downstream activity during dark adaptation of bleached rod cells (24.Kefalov V.J. Crouch R.K. Cornwall M.C.

However, direct mutagenesis of the proposed ligand path (shown in Fig. 1A) did not yield clear results as to a role for the open state holes during binding (21.Piechnick R. Ritter E. Hildebrand P.W. Ernst O.P. Scheerer P. Hofmann K.P. Heck M. Effect of channel mutations on the uptake and release of the retinal ligand in opsin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 5247-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to the hypothesis that 11CR binds the ops* state, attempts to shift the opsin to more MII-like conformations either through lowering the pH or addition of a G protein C-terminal peptide analog, Gt C-term peptide, also failed to accelerate 11CR binding (21.Piechnick R. Ritter E. Hildebrand P.W. Ernst O.P. Scheerer P. Hofmann K.P. Heck M. Effect of channel mutations on the uptake and release of the retinal ligand in opsin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Photobiol. 2008; 84: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, this transient activation model for 11CR binding, although attractive, has remained unsupported by conclusive experimental data. Here we directly addressed the question of what governs the ability of retinal to bind opsin using a new approach. Traditionally, retinal uptake by rhodopsin has been measured by monitoring formation of the Schiff base between the retinal and the protein after it enters the binding pocket. This is accomplished by measuring the increase in the characteristic absorbance at 500 nm. However, this approach requires monitoring the formation of the protonated Schiff base (detection of the 380 nm to 500 nm shift) and so retinal binding that does not result in a protonated Schiff base goes unnoticed (as both free retinal in detergent and MII absorb maximally near 380 nm and thus cannot be easily distinguished by comparing absorbance spectra). To circumvent this problem, we established a fluorescence assay to measure the rate of binding of retinal that is independent of protonated Schiff base formation. Essentially, this assay involves running a retinal release assay backward (26.Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. Structure and function in rhodopsin. Measurement of the rate of metarhodopsin II decay by fluorescence spectroscopy.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Our approach tracks the quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as the ligand binds in the pocket. A similar general approach has been used in several other works (21.Piechnick R. Ritter E.

Palczewski K. Asymmetry of the rhodopsin dimer in complex with transducin.FASEB J. 2013; 27: 1572-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here, we established and calibrated our approach to ensure accurate, reproducible measurements so that retinal binding rates measured by fluorescence could be directly compared between different conditions. Additionally, we started with naïve opsin in our study rather than the common approach of using decayed MII formed after photobleaching rhodopsin as this allowed us to measure rates without contamination of other free retinal. We then used this assay to directly test the transient activation hypothesis for retinal binding. Our strategy was to increase the amount of ops* present in a sample and then use our assay to determine whether the rates of retinal binding are faster as the above hypothesis would predict. Using the constitutively activating mutation M257Y (M257Y-CAM) (32.Han M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Constitutive activation of opsin by mutation of methionine 257 on transmembrane helix 6.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8253-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we shifted the conformational equilibrium from nearly fully inactive WT opsin to a mixture of ops and ops* species and compared the rates of ligand binding between these samples. Unexpectedly, rather than accelerating the rate of 11CR uptake, we found that the M257Y-CAM actually slowed 11CR binding compared with WT opsin. Moreover, stabilizing the ops* population of M257Y-CAM by conformational trapping with a peptide mimic of G protein C-terminus, Gt C-term peptide, further slowed 11CR binding (33.Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. Potent peptide analogues of a G protein receptor-binding region obtained with a combinatorial library.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 361-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 34.Imamoto Y. Seki I. Yamashita T. Shichida Y. Efficiencies of activation of transducin by cone and rod visual pigments.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 3010-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, we did find partial support for the transient activation hypothesis in experiments using ATR. Although ATR cannot bind to inactive WT ops, we found that ATR binding was dramatically increased as the ops* state was stabilized. The novel approach of fusing the Gt C-term peptide to the opsin C-terminus further amplified these effects. Together, these observations indicate that the transient activation hypothesis must be modified to include a role for conformational selection. In support of this postulate, we demonstrate that stabilizing a minute, fleeting ops* population present in the WT opsin population with the Gt C-term peptide enables WT opsin to stably bind ATR. Similarly, we found that a peptide corresponding to a flexible “finger” loop of arrestin (Arr peptide; residues 67–79) (35.Hanson S.M. Francis D.J. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Kolobova E.A. Hubbell W.L. Klug C.S. Gurevich V.V. Differential interaction of spin-labeled arrestin with inactive and active phosphorhodopsin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4900-4905Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) also enhanced ATR binding but had little effect on the binding of 11CR. Finally, we tested whether Hole B (TM5/TM6) observed in the active ops* and MII structures (14.Park J.H. Scheerer P. Hofmann K.P. Choe H.W. Ernst O.P. Crystal structure of the ligand-free G-protein-coupled receptor opsin.Nature. 2008; 454: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 15.Choe H.W. Kim Y.J. Park J.H. Morizumi T. Pai E.F. Krauss N. Hofmann K.P. Scheerer P. Ernst O.P. Crystal structure of metarhodopsin II.Nature. 2011; 471: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) might play a role in the shift of retinal binding rates. To do this, we expanded the opening with alanine substitutions and measured the effect on 11CR and ATR binding rates. These results showed that removing the TM5/TM6 “doors” did not enable ATR uptake and unexpectedly slowed 11CR binding. In summary, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that transient activation of opsin is required for 11CR binding. In fact, we observed that increasing ops* actually impaired 11CR binding. However, we did find that increasing the amount of ops* enhanced ATR binding, providing partial support of the transient activation hypothesis. We also discuss how together these data clearly show that, in our purified system, classical conformation selection between retinal isomers plays a key role for stable retinal binding and how this concept can be used to propose a conformational selection-based model for retinal binding. 11-cis-retinal was generously provided by Dr. R. Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina and the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health). Gt C-term peptide (VLEDLKSVGLF) (33.Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E.

Here, we summarize a strategy for applying human genetics to neuroscience drug discovery. Human genetics is a rational starting point for target identification in drug discovery, yet this approach has found little application in neuroscience. Recent large-scale analyses have begun to identify robust genetic loci for schizophrenia, providing an opportunity to derive novel drug targets. Here, we summarize a strategy for applying human genetics to neuroscience drug discovery. The application of human genetic findings has revolutionized drug discovery in select therapeutic areas, such as oncology, but it has made only a modest impact in identifying novel targets for psychiatric conditions. Indeed, psychiatry drug discovery—and schizophrenia in particular—is facing a crisis with an apparent extreme difficulty in delivering novel treatments despite a significant and unanimously acknowledged medical gap in the efficacy of current approaches for key aspects of the disorder, such as cognitive deficits (McCarroll and Hyman, 2013McCarroll S.A. Hyman S.E. Neuron. 2013; 80: 578-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Until recently, progress in psychiatric genetics was slow in comparison to other therapeutic areas, and the notion of being able to use human genetics to find new drug targets for schizophrenia was not widely embraced. Now, with the publication of 108 robustly associated loci for schizophrenia by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) (Ripke et al., 2014Ripke S. Neale B.M. Corvin A. Walters J.T.R. Farh K.H. Holmans P.A. Lee P. Bulik-Sullivan B. Collier D.A. Huang H. et al.Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumNature. 2014; 511: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (5093) Google Scholar), the stage is set for the discovery of novel treatment paradigms based on robust human genetic evidence. Comparing the genomes of subjects with and without the disorder, it has become clear that at least some of the susceptibility of schizophrenia can be linked to specific regions in the genome (loci). The loci implicate both novel and previously hypothesized mechanisms (dopamine, NMDA) as causally contributing to schizophrenia risk. The unprecedented high statistical robustness of the data included in the PGC schizophrenia study (36,989 patients and 113,075 controls from dozens of cohorts contributed by hundreds of investigators) instills strong confidence in the many novel candidate genes and pathways identified in this study. Now, as we are starting to identify novel aspects of the underlying biological basis of this disorder, we can be optimistic that new therapeutic hypotheses can be derived (and ultimately tested in the clinic) from these genetically informed neurobiological insights. The path from genetics to new medicines is long and far from clear, yet several aspects can be readily identified. Below, we outline one approach for moving from this exciting but long list of genetic candidates to the identification of disease-relevant pathways and mechanisms that could be viable targets for drug discovery. The approach we outline here is one taken by our group at Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development (WRD), and we openly acknowledge that there are other groups, both from industry and academia, with potentially similar or perhaps alternative strategies also pursuing candidates from these genetic data. It is also worth noting that the overall strategy deployed here for schizophrenia is easily generalizable and in principle applicable to any human complex disorder where sufficient genetic substrate is available, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and many more. These efforts will require extensive collaborations not only among industry, but with key academic partners and consortia to reach a common goal: a rational and data-driven quantitative exploration of novel target mechanisms to benefit patients at large. The value of human genetics in drug discovery and development is unquestionable, bridging the entire process from discovery genetics to clinical genetics. A portfolio of genetically validated targets can provide a sustainable pipeline of targets that are less biased toward “old” concepts and deeply rooted in human biology (Plenge et al., 2013Plenge R.M. Scolnick E.M. Altshuler D. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2013; 12: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In applying human genetics to the drug discovery process, we see three consecutive challenges: (1) getting from the relevant phenotype to a robustly disease-associated genetic locus, (2) deriving mechanistic insights of the underlying normal and pathological biology, and (3) translating such knowledge into a testable therapeutic hypothesis relevant to the patient population. To address these challenges, we have categorized our discovery path from common disease locus to mechanism and therapeutic opportunity into five steps (Table 1). While clearly focused on the discovery genetics aspect of the value creation chain in drug discovery, none of these workstreams should be considered in isolation. In fact, they should interact with and inform each other from the discovery process at the bench to clinical discoveries at the bedside, and vice versa.Table 1Applying Human Genetics to the Drug Discovery PipelineWorkstreamGoal1. Phenotype to locusDefine phenotypes and identify genetic loci robustly associated with or protective against disease risk.2.

Mechanism to diseaseIdentify a testable and actionable therapeutic hypothesis and opportunity for intervention.5. Disease to medicineMatch the therapeutic opportunity to the relevant pathogenic trajectory in the right patients. Open table in a new tab A first critical step in the approach employed by Pfizer WRD starts with the identification of putatively causal genes in LD (linkage disequilibrium)-independent loci associated with the disease. LD describes the fact that certain adjacent regions in the genome are inherited together more often than would be expected by chance. Working under the assumption that each LD-independent locus, particularly loci containing multiple genes, contains only one truly causal gene that gives rise to the disease association, we have developed and applied an integrative bioinformatics approach for identifying putative causal genes. Taking into account the genome architecture, functional variants (including expression and splicing QTLs [Lonsdale et al., 2013Lonsdale J. Thomas J. Salvatore M. Phillips R. Lo E. Shad S. Hasz R. Walters G. Garcia F. Young N. et al.GTEx ConsortiumNat. Genet. 2013; 45: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (4349) Google Scholar]), and prior knowledge of gene function, we prioritized putative causal genes linked to the lead single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of each independent disease-associated locus. We thus mapped > 90% of the 108 genome-wide associated loci from the PGC discovery sample to specific “best guess” single genes and ranked them for follow-up (Figure 1). It is worth noting that, despite significant recent progress, our current knowledge of functional variants especially relevant to brain tissues remains limited. Additional population-based multi-omics profiling data from large consortium efforts such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (Lonsdale et al., 2013Lonsdale J. Thomas J. Salvatore M. Phillips R. Lo E. Shad S. Hasz R. Walters G. Garcia F. Young N. et al.GTEx ConsortiumNat. Genet. 2013; 45: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (4349) Google Scholar) and advanced computational algorithms for integrative analysis are needed to further improve confidence in causal gene mapping. As a next step, we annotated and prioritized this list of putatively causal genes with additional data, such as tissue-specific mRNA expression, known functional variation, disease-associated rare mutations from OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim), de novo mutations identified by recent exome sequencing studies (Purcell et al., 2014Purcell S.M. Moran J.L. Fromer M. Ruderfer D. Solovieff N. Roussos P. O’Dushlaine C. Chambert K. Bergen S.E. Kähler A. et al.Nature. 2014; 506: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar), and prior literature knowledge. Where possible, we aimed at identifying an initial sense for direction of effect, such as increased or decreased expression levels, for the observed phenotypic association. This is important to develop an understanding of how the disease association might be reversed therapeutically, for example by agonistic or antagonistic mechanisms. This initial annotation and prioritization reduced the overall list to 14 bioinformatically prioritized genes with increased confidence. Finally, we brought together a dedicated team of experts composed of geneticists, bioinformaticians, statisticians, chemists, pharmacologists, biologists, and clinicians to contextualize the putative target candidates from the list of annotated and functionally curated causal genes that showed the highest confidence. In an iterative and time-intensive effort, we reviewed each bioinformatically prioritized gene in depth, taking into account the known human biology, mechanistic hypotheses based on prior literature evidence, findings from animal models, potential safety and adverse event risks, chemical “doability,” and potential therapeutic hypotheses. This overall workflow (Figure 1B) led to the identification of expertly reviewed genes with high confidence for experimental follow-up. Exploratory studies are currently under way for select new targets emerging from this locus-to-target triaging approach, aimed at addressing key gaps in confidence (such as unknown directionality of functional SNPs at the molecular level), mitigating potential safety risks, assessing the availability of chemical doability (i.e., druggability) and availability of reagents and tools, as well as identifying a set of preclinical and clinical endpoints relevant to schizophrenia, including neurocircuitry-based intermediate phenotypes. A strong focus is being placed on identifying a set of key experiments that can “break” rather than “make” a testable disease mechanism and potential therapeutic hypothesis. Such experiments include a range of approaches in cellular, animal, and nonhuman primate model systems to test the functional consequences and causality of the genetic association, beyond what might be considered “traditional” genetic knockout/transgenic approaches in animal models. As these experiments progress in the intermediate future, we fully expect a certain amount of attrition, but are also optimistic that the best targets will move toward proof-of-mechanism and proof-of-concept studies in the clinic with a higher likelihood of success. Currently, all approved pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia function primarily by blocking D2-type dopamine receptors. While it is highly encouraging to see that the DRD2 gene is among the top genetic loci uncovered by the PGC schizophrenia study and thus effectively validates the GWAS approach, D2-type dopamine receptor antipsychotics have limitations, mostly in the form of adverse side effects and poor efficacy against negative and cognitive deficits (Miyamoto et al., 2012Miyamoto S. Miyake N. Jarskog L.F. Fleischhacker W.W. Lieberman J.A. Mol. Psychiatry. 2012; 17: 1206-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Given the limitations of these medications, substantial efforts have been made to identify alternative treatment targets with novel mechanisms of action, most of which failed to date in clinical trials. Yet the PGC schizophrenia data may hold the key to future clinical success. Converging lines of evidence identified multiple themes relevant to drug discovery, including genes and pathways involved in synaptic transmission, neuroinflammation and the multiple histocompatibility complex (MHC), calcium signaling and homeostasis, as well as glutamate receptor function, regulation, and modulation (Ripke et al., 2014Ripke S.

Huang H. et al.Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumNature. 2014; 511: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (5093) Google Scholar). We would like to exemplify the output of the abovementioned locus-to-target triaging approach, i.e., the generation of testable mechanistic hypotheses for experimental follow-up (target validation) and the path and challenges toward formal portfolio entry based on three select case examples. Several L-type calcium channel genes are included in our candidate gene list as putatively causal genes in the PGC schizophrenia study, including CACNA1C (CaV1.2), CACNA1D (CaV1.3), and CACNB2 (CaVB2). Although these ion channels are among the best-understood drug targets for indications such as hypertension, they have thus far received little consideration for CNS indications due to a feared unfavorable cardiovascular profile (Waszkielewicz et al., 2013Waszkielewicz A.M. Gunia A. Szkaradek N. Słoczyńska K. Krupińska S. Marona H. Curr. Med. Chem. 2013; 20: 1241-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In order to effectively target these channels for psychiatric indications, it will be critical to determine whether brain-selective mechanisms (e.g., expression, posttranslational modification, auxiliary subunit combination, and regulation) exist and whether they are amenable to selective pharmacology. Indeed, L-type calcium channels are known to express a large functional diversity, e.g., in cardiac and smooth muscle tissue (Lipscombe et al., 2013Lipscombe D. Allen S.E. Toro C.P. Trends Neurosci. 2013; 36: 598-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Understanding tissue and cell type selectivity will pave the way to effectively target these channels in schizophrenia. Glutamatergic neurotransmission has been extensively explored (and thus far failed) as a potential therapeutic target in schizophrenia. Among the PGC findings, several genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission have the potential to make attractive novel drug targets, including GRIN2A, GRIA1, SRR, and CLCN3 (Ripke et al., 2014Ripke S. Neale B.M. Corvin A. Walters J.T.R. Farh K.H. Holmans P.A. Lee P. Bulik-Sullivan B. Collier D.A. Huang H. et al.Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumNature. 2014; 511: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (5093) Google Scholar). GRIN2A encodes the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor subunit NR2A, a key mediator of synaptic plasticity. NMDA receptor hypofunction has long been hypothesized to be one of the major biological underpinnings in schizophrenia (Coyle, 2006Coyle J.T. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2006; 26: 365-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). GRIA1 encodes the glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1), a subunit of the AMPA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor mediating fast synaptic transmission in the nervous system. AMPA receptor dysfunction has been linked to cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS), and several clinical trials have tested AMPA receptor potentiation as a modulator of cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia, thus far with mixed results. SRR encodes serine racemase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of L-serine to D-serine, the latter being an essential coagonist and activator of NMDA receptors (Martineau et al., 2014Martineau M. Parpura V. Mothet J.P. Front. Synaptic Neurosci. 2014; 6: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Preclinical models have suggested that depletion of D-serine can induce schizophrenia-like symptoms (Ma et al., 2013Ma T.M. Abazyan S. Abazyan B. Nomura J. Yang C. Seshadri S. Sawa A. Snyder S.H. Pletnikov M.V. Mol. Psychiatry. 2013; 18: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but it remains to be seen how such findings translate into humans. CLCN3 encodes a voltage-gated chloride channel that localizes to glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus, where it is thought to modulate synaptic plasticity (Guzman et al., 2014Guzman R.E. Alekov A.K. Filippov M. Hegermann J. Fahlke C. Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). How this chloride channel specifically contributes to the underlying disease biology in schizophrenia is unknown, however. Efforts at targeting glutamatergic neurotransmission are not novel, in particular for NMDA receptors. As one of the dominant pathophysiology hypotheses in schizophrenia posits a reduced function in at least a subset of NMDA receptors and excess cortical glutamate, pharmaceutical efforts have focused on enhancing NMDA receptor function (e.g., with glycine transporter [GlyT] blockers) or reducing excess glutamate (with mGluR2/3 agonists). Unfortunately, these efforts have not produced positive results in the clinic yet. There are many reasons that can account for such failures, ranging from the selection of an inappropriate target to inadequate patient selection in the trials. The latter option is supported by post hoc analyses of recent trials (Rabinowitz et al., 2013Rabinowitz J. Werbeloff N. Caers I. Mandel F.S. Stauffer V. Menard F. Kinon B.J. Kapur S. Schizophr. Res. 2013; 150: 334-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggesting patients in early disease stages or with more profound cognitive deficits are more likely to show a response. We are confident, however, that the genetic findings contained in the PGC schizophrenia study can indeed provide better guidance as to which targets and subpopulations might be best suited to address the glutamatergic neurotransmission deficits observed in schizophrenia. Several genes identified by our causal gene mapping efforts point to a potential involvement of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in schizophrenia, including AKT3 (PKB) and DGKZ (DGK-ZETA). AKT/GSK3 signaling has received therapeutic interest in psychiatry for some time. These are signaling mechanisms critical for cell survival and proliferation, and in the CNS they have a clear role in synaptic signaling and cell homeostasis (Morgan-Smith et al., 2014Morgan-Smith M. Wu Y. Zhu X. Pringle J. Snider W.D. Elife. 2014; 3: e02663Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The link to mTOR and other signaling pathways has brought attention to these pathways in regard to a diverse set of psychiatric conditions, including autism and schizophrenia (Emamian, 2012Emamian E.S. Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2012; 5: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Despite this high interest, the ubiquitous nature of these signaling pathways provides a high risk for unwanted effects if any of these enzymes was targeted directly. A better understanding of how AKT and its pathway are affected in brains of subjects with schizophrenia, e.g., by studying the cell type-specific transcriptome, epigenome, or proteome, could open the way to determine targets for novel approaches that could provide the desired brain selectivity and avoid serious systemic consequences. In fact, determining whether putative schizophrenia risk genes show indeed different profiles in the brains of affected subjects versus healthy controls, as assessed by multiple omics technologies, would certainly not only further our confidence in the role of these genes in the underlying disease biology, but facilitate prioritization of such genes with regard to drug discovery. Despite success at last for schizophrenia genetics in identifying robust and replicable risk loci, the fundamental gaps in our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia remain far from closed. These gaps pose significant challenges in our capabilities to identify key disease mechanisms that lend themselves to therapeutic interventions and thus new drug targets. In fact, the established strategies have not led to successful, fundamentally new schizophrenia medications in decades. Clinical and molecular investigators have independently begun to address these gaps in large cohorts from two opposing ends: at the genetic level (through genome-wide association studies [GWAS] and next-generation sequencing studies [NGS]) and at the brain circuitry level (through neuroimaging and neurophysiology studies). An important challenge in our approach is the very small effect size (odds ratio) of even the most robustly associated common variant loci. It has become clear from other fields and retrospective analyses of how drug targets map onto GWAS-implicated pathways that a direct extrapolation from odds ratio to biological effect size of implicated mechanism is seldom possible (Okada et al., 2014Okada Y. Wu D. Trynka G. Raj T. Terao C. Ikari K. Kochi Y. Ohmura K. Suzuki A. Yoshida S. et al.RACI consortiumGARNET consortiumNature. 2014; 506: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). In our view, the key information obtained from a GWAS is the statistically robust and unbiased but categorical identification of specific human biology as disease-causing. The more genes for any given pathway are implicated through human genetics, the greater our confidence will be to prioritize this pathway over others and eventually be in a position to look for biological interactions between genes of the same pathway. Yet the exact degree to which individual biological pathways contribute to the disease, as well as opportunities to identify biomarkers for subpopulations, cannot be answered with our current human genetics tools and thus need to be addressed through biological experiments. Another challenge is the likely complex genomic architecture in schizophrenia, a disorder with clear polygenic and environmental factors. Our approach of seeking biological pathways with multiple candidate genes may help reduce this risk and allow a thorough exploration of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions by informing further studies (e.g., assessing gene expression in critical brain regions in brains from patients and controls) that could elucidate how these interactions may correlate with disease. Indeed, we foresee exploring gene expression data as a necessary next step to address these issues within a systems biology conceptual framework. Working under the assumption that abnormal behavior observed in psychiatric conditions reflects abnormal brain function, a plethora of imaging genetics studies have explored the impact of risk genotypes on brain function using abnormal information processing at the circuitry level as an intermediate phenotype, including white matter integrity (Kochunov and Hong, 2014Kochunov P. Hong L.E. Schizophr. Bull. 2014; 40: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Largely, these studies have either been relatively small (and likely underpowered), or they have tested nonreplicated candidate gene associations, or both. The robust PGC genetic findings, however, should elicit a wave of fresh enthusiasm for using imaging genetics in appropriately sized cohorts as a unique and powerful strategy for understanding the underlying neural mechanism of genetic risk variants at the human brain level. Large-scale academic collaborative analyses of neuroimaging and genetic data, e.g., as conducted by the ENIGMA Consortium (Thompson et al., 2014Thompson P.M. Stein J.L. Medland S.E. Hibar D.P. Vasquez A.A. Renteria M.E. Toro R. Jahanshad N. Schumann G. Franke B. et al.Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, EPIGEN Consortium, IMAGEN Consortium, Saguenay Youth Study (SYS) GroupBrain Imaging Behav. 2014; 8: 153-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), will be well positioned to address some of these prior limitations (i.e., cohort size). However, the critical bottleneck remains the paucity of cohorts that have both deeply phenotyped neuroimaging and neurophysiology as well as genome-wide genotype data available to interrogate both modalities simultaneously and in the same sample. We believe that such a combined analysis is essential in order to further our understanding of disease biology and enable new drug target identification, as well as the identification of neuroimaging/neurophysiology biomarkers as surrogate endpoints in early clinical development and potentially for patient segmentation. Naturally, many open questions remain at multiple levels for which we would ideally like to see answers to bridge the gap from genetic locus to novel target mechanisms for schizophrenia. How much additional data, e.g., genomic, clinical, and epidemiological, do we truly need to convincingly propose a novel drug target with an expected high likelihood of success in clinical studies? What type of data is best suited in what circumstance? What strategies for patient segmentation and experimental human biology, e.g., neuroimaging, neurophysiology, etc., can human genetics provide? Despite such outstanding questions, the stage has never been set with more plentiful opportunities to accelerate drug discovery and development deeply rooted in human genetic findings, and we are highly optimistic about what the future may hold for psychiatric drug discovery. If we take advantage, as a field, of this opportunity, drug discovery in psychiatry may repeat the breakthrough and advances in personalized medicine we have become accustomed to in oncology in recent years.

https://openalex.org/W2062647344,"A brand name can be considered a mental category. Similarity-based categorization theory has been used to explain how consumers judge a new product as a member of a known brand, a process called brand extension evaluation. This study was an event-related potential study conducted in two experiments. The study found a two-stage categorization process reflected by the P2 and N400 components in brand extension evaluation. In experiment 1, a prime–probe paradigm was presented in a pair consisting of a brand name and a product name in three conditions, i.e., in-category extension, similar-category extension, and out-of-category extension. Although the task was unrelated to brand extension evaluation, P2 distinguished out-of-category extensions from similar-category and in-category ones, and N400 distinguished similar-category extensions from in-category ones. In experiment 2, a prime–probe paradigm with a related task was used, in which product names included subcategory and major-category product names. The N400 elicited by subcategory products was more significantly negative than that elicited by major-category products, with no salient difference in P2. We speculated that P2 could reflect the early low-level and similarity-based processing in the first stage, whereas N400 could reflect the late analytic and category-based processing in the second stage."
https://openalex.org/W2312364251,"The maintenance of bone homeostasis requires tight coupling between bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) underlying the differentiation and activities of these specialized cells are still largely unknown. Here, we identify choline kinase β (CHKB), a kinase involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, as a novel regulator of bone homeostasis. Choline kinase β mutant mice (flp/flp) exhibit a systemic low bone mass phenotype. Consistently, osteoclast numbers and activity are elevated in flp/flp mice. Interestingly, osteoclasts derived from flp/flp mice exhibit reduced sensitivity to excessive levels of extracellular calcium, which could account for the increased bone resorption. Conversely, supplementation of cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine in vivo and in vitro, a regimen that bypasses CHKB deficiency, restores osteoclast numbers to physiological levels. Finally, we demonstrate that, in addition to modulating osteoclast formation and function, loss of CHKB corresponds with a reduction in bone formation by osteoblasts. Taken together, these data posit CHKB as a new modulator of bone homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1972442431,"The constitution and biophysical properties of extracellular matrices can dramatically influence cellular phenotype during development, homeostasis, or pathogenesis. These effects can be signaled through a differentially regulated assembly of collagen fibrils, orchestrated by a family of collagen-associated small leucine-rich proteins (SLRPs). In this report, we describe the tissue-specific expression and function of a previously uncharacterized SLRP, chondroadherin-like (CHADL). We developed antibodies against CHADL and, by immunohistochemistry, detected CHADL expression mainly in skeletal tissues, particularly in fetal cartilage and in the pericellular space of adult chondrocytes. In situ hybridizations and immunoblots on tissue lysates confirmed this tissue-specific expression pattern. Recombinant CHADL bound collagen in cell culture and inhibited in vitro collagen fibrillogenesis. After Chadl shRNA knockdown, chondrogenic ATDC5 cells increased their differentiation, indicated by increased transcript levels of Sox9, Ihh, Col2a1, and Col10a1. The knockdown increased collagen II and aggrecan deposition in the cell layers. Microarray analysis of the knockdown samples suggested collagen receptor-related changes, although other upstream effects could not be excluded. Together, our data indicate that the novel SLRP CHADL is expressed in cartilaginous tissues, influences collagen fibrillogenesis, and modulates chondrocyte differentiation. CHADL appears to have a negative regulatory role, possibly ensuring the formation of a stable extracellular matrix."

https://openalex.org/W2086283096,"We recently found evidence that STAT1 in esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC) cells exerts tumor suppressor function, and it regulates five key regulators of apoptosis or cell-cycle progression, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, cyclin D1 and p21. In this study, we confirmed these findings in four ESCC cell lines. Using immunohistochemistry, we also assessed the expression of these proteins in 62 primary tumors. The expression of these markers was heterogeneous, ranging 39 to 69% of the cohort. Significant correlation was found between STAT1 and three proteins (p21, Bcl-xL and survivin), whereas only a trend was identified for cyclin D1 and Bcl-2. We then correlated the expression of these proteins with several clinicopathologic parameters including lymph node metastasis, depth of invasion, clinical stage and overall survival. Significant correlations were found between Bcl-2 and deep invasion (p = 0.033), survivin and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.006), as well as cyclin D1 and clinical stage (p = 0.014). Patients with p21-positive tumors had a significantly longer survival compared to those with p21-negative tumors (p = 0.031). To conclude, our findings support the concept that STAT1 exerts its tumor suppressor effects in ESCC via modulating the expression of key regulators of apoptosis and cell-cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2070092134,"Recent studies demonstrate reduced motor-nerve function during autoimmune muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) myasthenia gravis (MG). To further understand the basis of motor-nerve dysfunction during MuSK-MG, we immunized female C57/B6 mice with purified rat MuSK ectodomain. Nerve-muscle preparations were dissected and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) studied electrophysiologically, morphologically, and biochemically. While all mice produced antibodies to MuSK, only 40% developed respiratory muscle weakness. In vitro study of respiratory nerve-muscle preparations isolated from these affected mice revealed that 78% of NMJs produced endplate currents (EPCs) with significantly reduced quantal content, although potentiation and depression at 50 Hz remained qualitatively normal. EPC and mEPC amplitude variability indicated significantly reduced number of vesicle-release sites (active zones) and reduced probability of vesicle release. The readily releasable vesicle pool size and the frequency of large amplitude mEPCs also declined. The remaining NMJs had intermittent (4%) or complete (18%) failure of neurotransmitter release in response to 50 Hz nerve stimulation, presumably due to blocked action potential entry into the nerve terminal, which may arise from nerve terminal swelling and thinning. Since MuSK-MG-affected muscles do not express the AChR γ subunit, the observed prolongation of EPC decay time was not due to inactivity-induced expression of embryonic acetylcholine receptor, but rather to reduced catalytic activity of acetylcholinesterase. Muscle protein levels of MuSK did not change. These findings provide novel insight into the pathophysiology of autoimmune MuSK-MG."
https://openalex.org/W2064745658,"The biological control of insect pests is based on the use of natural enemies. However, the growing information on the molecular mechanisms underpinning the interactions between insects and their natural antagonists can be exploited to develop “bio-inspired” pest control strategies, mimicking suppression mechanisms shaped by long co-evolutionary processes. Here we focus on a virulence factor encoded by the polydnavirus associated with the braconid wasp Toxoneuron nigriceps (TnBV), an endophagous parasitoid of noctuid moth larvae. This virulence factor (TnBVANK1) is a member of the viral ankyrin (ANK) protein family, and appears to be involved both in immunosuppression and endocrine alterations of the host. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing TnBVANK1 showed insecticide activity and caused developmental delay in Spodoptera littoralis larvae feeding on them. This effect was more evident in a transgenic line showing a higher number of transcripts of the viral gene. However, this effect was not associated with evidence of translocation into the haemocoel of the entire protein, where the receptors of TnBVANK1 are putatively located. Indeed, immunolocalization experiments evidenced the accumulation of this viral protein in the midgut, where it formed a thick layer coating the brush border of epithelial cells. In vitro transport experiments demonstrated that the presence of recombinant TnBVANK1 exerted a dose-dependent negative impact on amino acid transport. These results open new perspectives for insect control and stimulate additional research efforts to pursue the development of novel bioinsecticides, encoded by parasitoid-derived genes. However, future work will have to carefully evaluate any effect that these molecules may have on beneficial insects and on non-target organisms."

We report no difference in the suppression of lymphocyte proliferation by CB-MSC that had undergone post-thaw culture and MSC not cultured post-thaw (p<0.0001). Also, there was no inter-donor variability between the lymphocyte suppressive properties of MSC harvested from the five different donors (p = 0.13). These findings suggest that cryopreserved CB-MSC may have clinical utility immediately upon thawing. One implication hereof is the possibility of using cryopreserved CB-MSC at third party locations without the need for cell culture equipment or competencies."
https://openalex.org/W2138684430,"Abstract The maintenance of DNA methylation in nascent DNA is a critical event for numerous biological processes. Following DNA replication, DNMT1 is the key enzyme that strictly copies the methylation pattern from the parental strand to the nascent DNA. However, the mechanism underlying this highly specific event is not thoroughly understood. In this study, we identified topoisomerase IIα (TopoIIα) as a novel regulator of the maintenance DNA methylation. UHRF1, a protein important for global DNA methylation, interacts with TopoIIα and regulates its localization to hemimethylated DNA. TopoIIα decatenates the hemimethylated DNA following replication, which might facilitate the methylation of the nascent strand by DNMT1. Inhibiting this activity impairs DNA methylation at multiple genomic loci. We have uncovered a novel mechanism during the maintenance of DNA methylation."

Phase III studies include highly selected patients. Thus, treatment response and development of viral resistance during triple therapy in a routine clinical setting needs to be determined. The aims of this study were to investigate treatment outcome and identify sequence variations after triple therapy in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection in a routine clinical setting. Methods 80 patients, who initiated and completed triple therapy in Denmark between May 2011 and November 2012, were included. Demographic data and treatment response were obtained from the Danish Database for Hepatitis B and C. Direct sequencing and clonal analysis of the RT-PCR amplified NS3 protease were performed in patients without cure following triple therapy. Results 38 (47%) of the patients achieved cure, 15 (19%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events and remained infected, and 27 (34%) experienced relapse or treatment failure of whom 15 of 21 analyzed patients had well-described protease inhibitor resistance variants detected. Most frequently detected protease variants were V36M and/or R155K, and V36M, in patients with genotype 1a and 1b infection, respectively. Conclusions The cure rate after triple therapy in a routine clinical setting was 47%, which is substantially lower than in clinical trials. Resistance variants towards protease inhibitors were seen in 71% of patients failing therapy indicating that resistance could have an important role in treatment response."

One of the most intensely studied examples is a hyperfunctional variant of the human β1-adrenoceptor that carries an arginine at position 389 in helix 8 (Arg-389-ADRB1). However, the mechanism underlying the higher efficacy of the Arg-389 variant remained unclear to date. Despite its hyperfunctionality, we found the Arg-389 variant of ADRB1 to be hyperphosphorylated upon continuous stimulation with norepinephrine compared with the Gly-389 variant. Using ADRB1 sensors to monitor activation kinetics by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, Arg-389-ADRB1 exerted faster activation speed and arrestin recruitment than the Gly-389 variant. Both activation speed and arrestin recruitment depended on phosphorylation of the receptor, as shown by knockdown of G protein-coupled receptor kinases and phosphorylation-deficient ADRB1 mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2085077000,"The α-glucosidase from sugar beet (SBG) is an exo-type glycosidase. The enzyme has a pocket-shaped active site, but efficiently hydrolyzes longer maltooligosaccharides and soluble starch due to lower Km and higher kcat/Km for such substrates. To obtain structural insights into the mechanism governing its unique substrate specificity, a series of acarviosyl-maltooligosaccharides was employed for steady-state kinetic and structural analyses. The acarviosyl-maltooligosaccharides have a longer maltooligosaccharide moiety compared with the maltose moiety of acarbose, which is known to be the transition state analog of α-glycosidases. The clear correlation obtained between log Ki of the acarviosyl-maltooligosaccharides and log(Km/kcat) for hydrolysis of maltooligosaccharides suggests that the acarviosyl-maltooligosaccharides are transition state mimics. The crystal structure of the enzyme bound with acarviosyl-maltohexaose reveals that substrate binding at a distance from the active site is maintained largely by van der Waals interactions, with the four glucose residues at the reducing terminus of acarviosyl-maltohexaose retaining a left-handed single-helical conformation, as also observed in cycloamyloses and single helical V-amyloses. The kinetic behavior and structural features suggest that the subsite structure suitable for the stable conformation of amylose lowers the Km for long-chain substrates, which in turn is responsible for higher specificity of the longer substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1964394383,"Plasmodium falciparum is the most lethal of the human malaria parasites. The virulence is associated with the capacity of the infected red blood cell (iRBC) to sequester inside the deep microvasculature where it may cause obstruction of the blood-flow when binding is excessive. Rosetting, the adherence of the iRBC to uninfected erythrocytes, has been found associated with severe malaria and found to be mediated by the NTS-DBL1α-domain of Plasmodium falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1). Here we show that the reactivity of plasma of Cameroonian children with the surface of the FCR3S1.2-iRBC correlated with the capacity to disrupt rosettes and with the antibody reactivity with a recombinant PfEMP1 (NTS-DBL1α of IT4var60) expressed by parasite FCR3S1.2. The plasma-reactivity in a microarray, consisting of 96 overlapping 15-mer long peptides covering the NTS-DBL1α domain from IT4var60 sequence, was compared with their capacity to disrupt rosettes and we identified five peptides where the reactivity were correlated. Three of the peptides were localized in subdomain-1 and 2. The other two peptide-sequences were localized in the NTS-domain and in subdomain-3. Further, principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least square analysis generated a model that supported these findings. In conclusion, human antibody reactivity with short linear-peptides of NTS-DBL1α of PfEMP1 suggests subdomains 1 and 2 to hold anti-rosetting epitopes recognized by anti-rosetting antibodies. The data suggest rosetting to be mediated by the variable areas of PfEMP1 but also to involve structurally relatively conserved areas of the molecule that may induce biologically active antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1977788831,"Objective This study aimed to assess changes in osteophytic, chondral, and subchondral structures in a surgically-induced osteoarthritis (OA) rabbit model in order to correlate MRI findings with the macroscopic progress of OA and to define the timepoint for disease status in this OA model. Methods The OA model was constructed by surgery in thirty rabbits with ten normal rabbits serving as controls (baseline). High-resolution three-dimensional MRI using a 1.5-T coil was performed at baseline, two, four, and eight weeks post-surgery. MRIs of cartilage lesions, subchondral bone lesions, and osteophyte formations were independently assessed by two blinded radiologists. Ten rabbits were sacrificed at baseline, two, four, and eight weeks post-surgery, and macroscopic evaluation was independently performed by two blinded orthopedic surgeons. Results The signal intensities and morphologies of chondral and subchondral structures by MRI accurately reflected the degree of OA. Cartilage defects progressed from a grade of 0.05–0.15 to 1.15–1.30 to 1.90–1.97 to 3.00–3.35 at each successive time point, respectively (p<0.05). Subchondral bone lesions progressed from a grade of 0.00 to 0.78–0.90 to 1.27–1.58 to 1.95–2.23 at each successive time point, respectively (p = 0.000). Osteophytes progressed from a size (mm) of 0.00 to 0.87–1.06 to 1.24–1.87 to 2.21–3.21 at each successive time point, respectively (p = 0.000). Conclusions Serial observations revealed that MRI can accurately detect the progression of cartilage lesions and subchondral bone edema over an eight-week period but may not be accurate in detecting osteophyte sizes. Week four post-surgery was considered the timepoint between OA-negative and OA-positive status in this OA model. The combination of this OA model with MRI evaluation should provide a promising tool for the pre-clinical evaluation of new disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1979801167,"We have made little recent progress developing effective new treatments for neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Novel molecular mechanisms have been identified, but have not translated into the clinic. We suggest an alternative: combinations of treatments targeting different aspects of final common pathways in biologically defined clinical subgroups. This will require integrated translational neuroscience and international public-private partnerships. We have made little recent progress developing effective new treatments for neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Novel molecular mechanisms have been identified, but have not translated into the clinic. We suggest an alternative: combinations of treatments targeting different aspects of final common pathways in biologically defined clinical subgroups. This will require integrated translational neuroscience and international public-private partnerships. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide suffer from neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders that are severe, enduring, and come at a very significant cost. Whereas brain disorders associated with aging, i.e., dementia and Parkinson’s disease, are widely recognized as priorities to be urgently addressed by industries, public institutions, and charities, less attention is paid to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism (autism spectrum disorders [ASDs]), despite their high prevalence and impact on society. ASDs comprise a family of highly genetic, heterogeneous, neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, and by unusual repetitive behaviors. Around 1% of all children suffer from ASDs, making them more common than childhood cancer, juvenile diabetes, and pediatric AIDS combined. Thus, an estimated three million patients in the European Union (EU), 1.5 million patients in the United States (US), and tens of millions of patients worldwide are affected by ASDs. As for all neuropsychiatric/neurodevelopmental disorders, we should have made more progress in reducing the disease burden of ASDs. Basic neuroscience is in its “discovery heyday” of potential molecular mechanisms underpinning a large number of disorders, and major investments have been made in the EU and the US to understand how the brain works in health and disease (e.g., the Human Brain Project and the NIH Brain Initiative). Yet it is still unclear whether and/or when these large-scale research endeavors will translate into new therapies. We suggest that the challenges and the potential solutions include a complex interaction between knowledge of disease biology together with the way science, industry, and regulators are organized. Scientific challenges for most neuropsychiatric/neurodevelopmental disorders include disease heterogeneity, biological/clinical overlap between disorders, and absence of reliable disease biomarkers. Most of these disorders also likely have a large number of causative (and disease-modifying) mechanisms that impact a smaller number of final common pathways. Moreover, we will need to modulate pathophysiology in people who have had a brain disorder (or are at ultra-high risk for developing one) for many years/decades. Hence, besides the complex scientific challenges to be addressed for the identification of molecular mechanisms that may provide therapeutic targets, it is essential to develop innovative tools to assess the efficiency of therapeutic interventions, to delineate the patient populations that will benefit from them, and to intervene at a stage where the brain changes are reversible. Furthermore, lessons learned in other difficult disease areas such as cancer suggest that the most effective therapeutic strategies in ASDs will be based on combinations of treatments that target different aspects of final common pathways over a relatively long time period. This is illustrated by recent evidence that the pathophysiology of ASDs may include a combination of GABAergic and inflammatory mechanisms acting at different developmental time points (Voineagu et al., 2011Voineagu I. Wang X. Johnston P. Lowe J.K. Tian Y. Horvath S. Mill J. Cantor R.M. Blencowe B.J. Geschwind D.H. Nature. 2011; 474: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Basic neuroscience also faces political/cultural challenges to being more rapidly (and cost-effectively) translated into treatments. Current funding mechanisms understandably mainly support grants that are relatively short term and narrowly focused. Also, many neuroscientists (1) do not work in multidisciplinary groups, (2) are not trained to seek a “translational” application for their work by structuring experiments that will lead to treatments that can gain regulatory approval, (3) (incorrectly) assume that if they identify a mechanism it will then be “picked up” by industry and developed into a treatment, and/or (4) do not apply the stringent rigor in compound testing as done in industry. Perhaps most importantly the experimental models typically employed by basic scientists (including those in industry) mainly investigate one potential causative mechanism and at one time point. This approach misses the most likely causative and clinical scenarios (interacting causative mechanisms with differing effects across development, and the interaction with other treatments already being prescribed for very commonly associated mental health comorbidities). In other words, how likely is it that a treatment targeting one molecular mechanism, tested in rodents at one developmental time point, and piloted in small groups of medication-free individuals with a clinical disorder, is going to work in “real-world” populations of clinically (and biologically) heterogeneous individuals, who typically are of varying ages, already receiving a variety of different medications, and suffering from very common comorbidities (such as intellectual disability, depression, anxiety, or ADHD) that are all associated with biological variation and impact on outcome? Facing this complexity, the pharmaceutical industry is reluctant to invest in research and development on disorders such as ASDs, and especially to conduct the costly large-scale, long-term clinical trials that are needed to move therapeutic approaches forward. Moreover, this commercial reluctance is reinforced because the key parameters to demonstrate drug efficacy are not established, the regulatory environment is uncertain, and the overall risk of failure is very high. These legitimate concerns should be urgently addressed, since recent important advances have generated new hopes for pharmacological intervention in ASDs. First, promising drug targets have been identified, and perhaps especially the metabotropic glutamate (Williams, 2012Williams S.C. Nat. Med. 2012; 18: 840Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and GABA-A receptors (Han et al., 2014Han S. Tai C. Jones C.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2014; 81: 1282-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Second, there is evidence in a mouse model of ASDs that neuronal alteration can be reversed after completion of brain development (Baudouin et al., 2012Baudouin S.J. Gaudias J. Gerharz S. Hatstatt L. Zhou K. Punnakkal P. Tanaka K.F. Spooren W. Hen R. De Zeeuw C.I. et al.Science. 2012; 338: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Third, recent evidence suggests that certain genetic mutations might be used to stratify ASD patients early in development (Bernier et al., 2014Bernier R. Golzio C. Xiong B. Stessman H.A. Coe B.P. Penn O. Witherspoon K. Gerdts J. Baker C. Vulto-van Silfhout A.T. et al.Cell. 2014; 158: 263-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). And fourth, the potential for biomarkers to further aid clinical stratification has emerged from neuroimaging, eye tracking, and electrophysiological studies (including adults; see Ecker et al., 2010Ecker C. Marquand A. Mourão-Miranda J. Johnston P. Daly E.M. Brammer M.J. Maltezos S. Murphy C.M. Robertson D. Williams S.C. Murphy D.G. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 10612-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In order to take the best advantage of this recent progress, pharmaceutical companies organize collaborative efforts at different levels. Above all, major companies active in the field recognize that neuroscience may prove to be a privileged area for noncompetitive research, and so they will likely benefit from joining forces with each other, and academia, to address some of the most difficult challenges related to ASDs. As an example, by sharing their experience and pooling data from 34 previous trials with antipsychotic agents in schizophrenia, five companies working with academic partners produced evidence that (by focusing on relevant symptoms and paying attention to gender balance) it is possible to significantly reduce both the number of patients and the duration of observation to demonstrate drug efficacy (Rabinowitz et al., 2014Rabinowitz J. Werbeloff N. Caers I. Mandel F.S. Stauffer V. Ménard F. Kinon B.J. Kapur S. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 2014; 75: e308-e316Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Collaboration between industry and academia is also expanding beyond the usual bilateral agreement between a single company and a given university. For instance, the building of large public-private consortia is increasingly driven by novel research strategies based on the collection and management of large data sets, the so-called “big data” approaches, which might revolutionize research in neurosciences (Manji et al., 2014Manji H.K. Insel T.W. Narayan V.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2014; 13: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In ASDs, the consortium EU-AIMS launched by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) represents the most important public-private partnership driven by pharmaceutical companies in the field of autism. IMI launched in 2008 as a joint undertaking between the EU and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). IMI’s goal is to speed up the development of, and patient access to, safer and more effective medicines in fields as diverse as diabetes, medicines safety, clinical trial design, and the assessment of real-life effectiveness of new treatments. With a total budget of over EUR five billion for the period 2008–2024, IMI is the world’s biggest public-private partnership in health; it forges collaborations between researchers in industry, academia, small- and medium-sized enterprises, patient groups, regulators, and others involved in health research and healthcare. In most cases, IMI projects are inspired and driven by industry. IMI enables the “open innovation” approach by acting as a neutral third party, providing impartial advice and guidance and ensuring that the interests of all project partners are respected when it comes to issues such as governance and intellectual property. EU-AIMS was launched in 2012 (Murphy and Spooren, 2012Murphy D. Spooren W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2012; 11: 815-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and has been one of the most successful of the 50 IMI projects launched to date, both in terms of scientific output and interactions between the different stakeholders including the European Medicines Agency (EMA), FDA, and patient advocates. For instance, Autism Speaks, the world’s leading autism science and advocacy organization, supports EU-AIMS both scientifically and financially in developing large-scale biobanks and data repositories. EU-AIMS brings together overlapping themes to underpin new drug discovery for ASDs. This reflects our belief that neither “top-down” clinical and translational studies, nor “bottom-up” model system analysis, can impact on ASDs alone. Rather, we need to integrate proven technologies around (for example) animal models and PET, together with new approaches (e.g., fMRI, and multiomics to identify candidate biomarkers, and induced pluripotent stem cells for drug screening). These integrated approaches are also applied to targets for clinical populations that encompass at-risk infants, children and adults with ASDs, and nonautistic individuals with genetic abnormalities that may be informative (e.g., those with synaptic gene defects). Our strategy, therefore, employs synergistic experimental work packages (WPs) bringing together animal model and patient studies to progress new translational approaches to ASDs. Together, the aim of these WPs is to deliver new validated assays, both in vivo and in vitro, that aid our understanding of etiology and deliver tractable platforms for drug discovery in ASDs (Figure 1). To date, we have linked cellular deficits to systems-level abnormalities and ASD-relevant behavior by creating a centralized repository of rodent models with high construct and face validity that are shared by all partners. For instance, we recently showed that Nlgn3 knockout mice (a model for ASDs) display a convergent pathophysiology with fragile X syndrome, which could be genetically (Baudouin et al., 2012Baudouin S.J. Gaudias J. Gerharz S. Hatstatt L. Zhou K. Punnakkal P. Tanaka K.F. Spooren W. Hen R. De Zeeuw C.I. et al.Science. 2012; 338: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and pharmacologically rescued. To translate findings from animals to humans (and back) we have already developed new translational neuroimaging stratification techniques (Ecker et al., 2013Ecker C. Ronan L. Feng Y. Daly E. Murphy C. Ginestet C.E. Brammer M. Fletcher P.C. Bullmore E.T. Suckling J. et al.MRC AIMS ConsortiumProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 13222-13227Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), PET ligands, rodent touch-screen tests, and behavioral assays. For example, we reported structural and functional candidate biomarkers that are specific to ASDs (i.e., not found in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD) or that vary between males and females with ASDs (Lai et al., 2013Lai M.C. Lombardo M.V. Suckling J. Ruigrok A.N. Chakrabarti B. Ecker C. Deoni S.C. Craig M.C. Murphy D.G. Bullmore E.T. Baron-Cohen S. MRC AIMS ConsortiumBrain. 2013; 136: 2799-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Also, our proof-of-concept studies showed abnormalities in striatal glutamate concentration in both rodent models and adults with ASDs that are linked with abnormal functional connectivity and symptom severity (Horder et al., 2013Horder J. Lavender T. Mendez M.A. O’Gorman R. Daly E. Craig M.C. Lythgoe D.J. Barker G.J. Murphy D.G. Transl. Psychiatry. 2013; 3: e279Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Further, we reported that some brain functional anomalies can be reversed in ASDs (and even in adults) by targeting serotonin (Daly et al., 2012Daly E.M. Deeley Q. Ecker C. Craig M. Hallahan B. Murphy C. Johnston P. Spain D. Gillan N. Brammer M. et al.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2012; 69: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, Daly et al., 2014Daly E. Ecker C. Hallahan B. Deeley Q. Craig M. Murphy C. Johnston P. Spain D. Gillan N. Gudbrandsen M. et al.Brain. 2014; 137: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In parallel, we identified several new risk factors—e.g., we showed that father’s age significantly increases the risk for ASDs (and schizophrenia) by increasing the rate of de novo copy-number variants (Kong et al., 2012Kong A. Frigge M.L. Masson G. Besenbacher S. Sulem P. Magnusson G. Gudjonsson S.A. Sigurdsson A. Jonasdottir A. Jonasdottir A. et al.Nature. 2012; 488: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). However, developing new treatments also requires a clinical research and training platform to underpin clinical trials. Hence, we have created a unique clinical research platform comprising two large-scale multidisciplinary cohorts spanning (i) infants at risk for ASDs (“Eurosibs”) to identify early predictive markers for ASDs (before behavioral symptoms manifest), and (ii) children, adolescents, and adults with ASDs (“EU-AIMS LEAP”) to identify biomarkers that can be used to stratify patients into more homogeneous groups. To facilitate future drug trials in Europe, we have worked with patient organizations representing people with ASDs (e.g., Autism Europe and COST-ESSEA) to establish a new clinical trials network that currently includes 78 expert sites across 37 European countries. Future clinical trials, in turn, will require objective outcome markers that are accepted by the relevant regulatory authorities. Thus, EU-AIMS has led the way by being the first publicly funded research network to work with a regulatory authority, the EMA, to obtain qualification advice on how our experiments should be structured, so that any new treatment targets, stratification tools, or outcome markers we develop have a better chance of being accepted for use in clinical trials. Hence, the EU is now at a stage that would have been unimaginable only a few years ago—we are on the cusp of being able to translate into man novel treatments for ASDs that target specific molecular deficits. To do this successfully, however, we need to learn from past mistakes and avoid reliance on subjective self- (or observer)-based reports and the use of brief and small-scale (i.e., underpowered) trials of heterogeneous populations that do not adapt to emerging data. Moreover, we will need to address the fact that the process for developing proof of concept is inefficient with companies launching similar products and targeting similar patient and control groups. This approach replicates effort, and lessons learnt from one failure (or success) are not shared. The future will therefore likely require studies of large numbers of extensively (“deep”) phenotyped individuals for a longer duration of time, using novel (e.g., adaptive) trial designs. For instance, adaptive clinical trials represent a more flexible and responsive approach for drug development in which researchers can simultaneously compare several candidate drugs to a placebo and test and compare drugs individually and in combination. As the effects of the candidate drugs are continuously measured and analyzed, researchers can adapt the trial in response to new findings. For example, if a candidate medicine appears to be particularly effective in specific categories of patients, then that medicine can be preferentially directed to those people to confirm this finding. Similarly, if a drug proves ineffective, it can be dropped from the trial, and new drugs can easily be added to it. This adaptive approach has already proven successful in breast cancer research and will soon be trialled via a new IMI project in the Alzheimer’s field. Linked to adaptive trials, we suggest that more exploration is required of the concept of adaptive licensing, in which marketing approval for new medicines is granted in a staggered approach, starting with a (clearly identified) group for whom the need for a new treatment is the most urgent. As further evidence is gathered on the risks and benefits of the medicine, the approval may be extended to include further groups. Such an approach would be very much appropriate in ASDs, starting with homogeneous groups identified on the basis of genetic markers. These new approaches have been adopted into the overall strategy defined for the next phase of the IMI (IMI 2). This second phase of IMI, which has just been launched, is focusing on innovative methods and tools ensuring rapid access of patients to innovative drugs. We anticipate that the efforts successfully pioneered by the EU-AIMS consortium will be pursued under IMI 2, including links to other international consortia and regulatory authorities outside Europe.

From mental health to rare diseases, charitable nonprofits and foundations are bringing energy, perspective, and leadership to the process of translational research. In challenging researchers to become more connected—to each other and to patients—charities are helping neuroscience deliver innovation that is relevant to real people in the real world. Translational aims have been a remarkable engine for driving research investment in the neurosciences. But, as noted by many writers in this issue of Neuron, despite decades of major investment, our therapeutic successes have been few and far between. Could it be that our aims are only wishful thinking? Most certainly not. As this issue makes clear, there is value in taking a critical look at what has been achieved thus far, considering lessons learned, and reconsidering our approaches to treatment development. This period of reflection also creates an opportunity to invite different perspectives to the table and to engage in broader thinking about our challenges. Non-profit and charitable organizations, which already play an important role in the research enterprise, represent one such important and often overlooked perspective. What might we learn from them? And how can we include these organizations more effectively in efforts to transform the translational neuroscience effort? It is important to note from the start that nonprofits are as widely variable in character as entities in any other business sector. Most of us learn about nonprofits from the organizations that flood our mailboxes, street corners, and walking paths with fundraising appeals; for the purposes of this article, I will be referring solely to nonprofits supporting health/medical research, particularly in the neurosciences. Even so, this area of nonprofit activity is huge, encompassing small local fundraising groups and massive philanthropic organizations like the Wellcome Trust or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (see Table 1). For the sake of clarity, I will use the terms “charity” to refer to organizations (of any size) raising money from the public and “foundation” to refer to private philanthropy and endowed foundations.Table 1Examples of Nonprofit Organizations Supporting Translational Neuroscience ResearchOrganizationsa“Charity” refers to organizations (of any size) raising money from the public. “Foundation” refers to private philanthropy and endowed foundations that do not raise money from the public.WebsiteFocus2013 Research Expenditure (unless stated)bUS-based charities spend was taken from IRS Form 990 (2013) if available.

Open table in a new tab This table depicts a representative, but by no means comprehensive, list of charitable organizations with an interest in neuroscience research. Having worked with organizations in both the US and the UK, I can confirm that while there are some differences in operational style (due to cultural and tax-code differences), these differences pale in comparison to the large strategic issues facing the entire sector. The impact of social media on both fundraising and program development has been enormous: Witness the impact of the “Ice Bucket Challenge” on the ALS community. Fast-moving changes in technology and the push toward personalized medicine are taking place on both sides of the Atlantic. Adapting to these changes is just one of the many challenges facing health research charities, all while keeping an eye on the prize—delivering improvements in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention interventions. Just as there is a spectrum of nonprofits across the US and UK, so is there a spectrum of research strategies and research investment styles employed by charities and foundations. Some organizations focus their energies on basic science and discovery research, while others seek only to support applied or translational research; others support a mixed portfolio. Even further along the spectrum are organizations, particularly social services charities, investing in research toward prevention. To get the most benefit from nonprofit relationships, it is important for translational neuroscientists to understand how an organization positions their funding goals with respect to the classic T0-T4 translational pathway and their investment strategy (Figure 1). A large percentage of nonprofit research programs use investigator-driven funding models as established by the NIH and the MRC. In the neurosciences, discussions about funding generally include that most traditional and familiar charity funding strategy—the “career development award.” This resource is more important than ever for early career investigators as government and industry funding for neuroscientists becomes tighter. For charities, these awards are a way to seed a field and develop career paths in emerging areas of research—as has been the case with much beloved funding from the Hereditary Disease Foundation (http://www.hdfoundation.org) or the NARSAD (http://www.bbrfoundation.org) grants from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation. We are utilizing this time-honored approach to introduce my own organization, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, (http://www.joinmq.org) to research professionals. At the more experimental end of the research spectrum are the organizations working to stimulate meaningful advances in the translational research path itself. Charities like the Alzheimer’s Association (http://www.alz.org), Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) (http://www.michaeljfox.org), and the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation (SMA Foundation, where I worked for many years; http://www.smafoundation.org) are directing research investments toward tool development, biomarker initiatives, and therapeutics development itself. Typically, this kind of research strategy requires the ability to invest a million dollars or more in individual projects, which has been a barrier to many smaller charities. However, over the last 20 years, a small group of nonprofits, generally focused on single gene disorders, have formed solely to accelerate therapeutics development. These charities are finding ways to make smaller grants (on the order of $50,000–$500,000) meaningful by supporting timely and important “derisking” investments along the discovery and development pathway. Examples of these kinds of nonprofits include investors like the Parent Project for Muscular Dystrophy (http://www.parentprojectmd.org) (therapeutics development); FARA (http://www.curefa.org), which leads infrastructure and therapeutics investments in Freidrich’s Ataxia; FRAXA (http://www.fraxa.org) doing the same for Fragile X syndrome; and the Rett Syndrome charities. Each of these organizations has made important contributions to demonstrating that the translational research pathway can indeed advance discovery and/or therapeutics development for brain diseases. At the far end of the spectrum are philanthropic investors such as Paul Allen, James Simon, Eli Broad, the Stanley Family, Lord David Sainsbury and others in the US, UK and abroad who, through their foundations, are making iconic investments in the research process. Their support of major initiatives including the Allen Brain Atlas (http://www.brain-map.org), SFARI (http://sfari.org) and the Simon Simplex Collection (autism), the Broad Institute and Stanley Centers (http://www.broadinstitute.org) (schizophrenia) for genetic research and the Sainsbury Wellcome Center (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/swc) for Neural Circuits and Behavior, is giving researchers the standardized tools and resources needed to advance translational pathways across multiple areas of interest. In so doing, these philanthropists have raised the level of visibility of the neuroscience among policy makers – and also a certain level of expectation that science is working to deliver tangible human benefit (Broad, 2014Broad, W.J. (2014) The New York Times, March 16, 2014. http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/science/billionaires-with-big-ideas-are-privatizing-american-science.html.Google Scholar). In many ways, research funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Wellcome Trust underpin many of our translational efforts in the neurosciences. The projects supported by these endowed foundations are important charitable complements to investments by governmental agencies; their contributions to research methods and policy development cannot be overestimated. While perhaps not as familiar to people in the US, the Wellcome Trust has been a major driver of discovery and translational efforts across many fronts in the UK, from the Sanger Institute for genetics research to psychological research; it also happens to be the leading funder of our grand experiment in mental health research at MQ. While not all nonprofits are alike, there is sophistication, energy, and momentum in this sector. It is wise to think of charities as not only supporters, but also initiators and partners for translational initiatives in our field. Thanks to new tools at our disposal to better understand brain function, there has never been a more important time to work with nonprofits to maximize our translational research opportunities (Deisseroth, 2014Deisseroth K. Nature. 2014; 505: 309-317https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12982Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Despite our optimism about the translational process, experience has shown us that it can take 20 years or more to realize the clinical benefits of the search for new treatment targets (Wooding et al., 2013Wooding, S., Pollitt, A., Castle-Clarke, S., Cochran, G., Diepeveen, S., Guthrie, S., Horvitz-Lennon, V.L., Jones, M.J., Chonaill, S.N., et al. (2013). http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR325.html.Google Scholar). Similarly, our experience in single gene disorders (Huntington’s disease and muscular dystrophy are prime examples) has taught us that gene identification does not directly lead to treatment. If nothing else, our current decade should represent the time when research funders and investigators alike work together to describe translational neuroscience process more realistically for patients and donors. Therefore, an important step for both sides of a charity relationship is to encourage clarity and feasibility of research goals. Charities and advisers need to be conscious of their respective tolerance for risk and expectations for return on investment. Ultimately, there is a sweet spot for every investor and researcher seeking to make a contribution to translational neuroscience research. Funders and researchers are sharing lessons learned from translational experience in forums supported by various institutes at the NIH, the Institute of Medicine, and professional associations like the Health Research Alliance (http://www.healthra.org) in the US and the Association of Medical Research Charities (http://www.amrc.org.uk) in the UK. There also exists a delightful commitment to “pay it forward” in the nonprofit community, exemplified by leaders like Robert Beall, the CEO of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (http://www.cff.org) and architect of the development of Kalydeco, a true translational success story (for an interesting background profile, see Groopman, 2009Groopman, J. (2009). The New Yorker, May 4, 2009. http://www.cff.org/UploadedFiles/aboutCFFoundation/PressRoom/InTheNews/The-New-Yorker-Open-Channels-5-4-09.pdf.Google Scholar). Another is Robi Blumenstein, visionary leader of the CHDI Foundation (http://chdifoundation.org) and coauthor of a recent paper on how funders can contribute to best practices for scientific reproducibility (Munafò et al., 2014Munafò M. Noble S. Browne W.J. Brunner D. Button K. Ferreira J. Holmans P. Langbehn D. Lewis G. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 7-9Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). NIH has taken knowledge sharing a step further with several programs designed to foster translation for charities and investigators alike. Many of these projects have now been consolidated under the new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS; http://www.ncats.nih.gov), including the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network, some 22 consortia focused on linking researchers and clinicians in therapeutic development and the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA; 60 participating institutions). The Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program has been used effectively to advance therapeutics development for muscular dystrophy and for Neiman-Pick Disease (see the Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation; http://www.parseghian.org). NCATS is also home to specific translational resources from assay development and high throughput screening to toxicity profiling resources; MJFF recently announced a partnership to explore mitochondrial dysfunction targets. Similar infrastructures now exist at many universities in the US and UK (see the Target Discovery Institute at Oxford University; http://www.tdi.ox.ac.uk/home). It is also important to note that the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (http://www.fnih.org) is home to several public/private partnerships in translational research including the groundbreaking Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; http://www.adni-info.org), which helped define parameters for successful collaboration among diverse partners including charitable organizations. The Alzheimer’s Association has been a leader in this regard and has extended its learning to partnerships around the world to advance therapeutics research. The European Union has taken these collaborations to a new level with the Innovative Medicines Initiative (http://www.imi.europa.eu) described elsewhere in this issue. There are, of course, common themes that run across these examples of nonprofit investment: 1. Charities bring a sense of urgency, focus, and mission to research that can transcend obstacles to discovery and development. The urgent need for treatments of any kind can free up remarkable energies to address obstacles to research. For example, charitable organizations have tackled intellectual property concerns by helping the research community make practical distinctions between precompetitive and competitive areas of research. Such distinctions seem commonplace now but were an innovation 12 years ago when the SMA Foundation and others were looking to create access to research tools like mouse models and antibodies. It was that simple act of identifying aligned goals between academia, industry, and charities that proved to be a key step in advancing IP discussions and removing blockades in the research process. When time is of the essence, in fatal disorders like SMA or ALS, nothing is more important than keeping programs moving smoothly along the translational pathway toward the clinic. Hence, translational investigators are sure to meet families and charities that know the drug development process well and are focused on transferring discovery from academia to industry as rapidly as possible so that business timelines can be invoked. This transfer process is not a one-way street: The best translational programs involve academia and industry in iterative work to more fully understand disease and treatment pathways. 2. Charities are effective facilitators of translational opportunities in neuroscience. Charities are teaching us how to forge connections across disciplines (and continents) to further our understanding of brain disorders. Using the SMA experience as an example again, one of the strengths of the business case for SMA research was the potential for learnings that might be applicable to other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly enough, not only does SMA research inform ALS programs (D’Ambrosi et al., 2014D’Ambrosi N. Rossi S. Gerbino V. Cozzolino M. Front Cell Neurosci. 2014; 8: 279PubMed Google Scholar) and other neurodegenerative disorders (Vanderweyde et al., 2013Vanderweyde T. Youmans K. Liu-Yesucevitz L. Wolozin B. Gerontology. 2013; 59 (Published online Aug 30, 2013): 524-533https://doi.org/10.1159/000354170Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it has also had implications for known and emerging disorders of transcription and RNA processing. Similar examples include the intersections between Down's syndrome and dementia and 22q deletion syndrome and risk for schizophrenia (Karayiorgou et al., 2012Karayiorgou M. Flint J. Gogos J.A. Malenka R.C. Genetic and Neural Complexity in Psychiatry 2011 Working GroupNat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 811-812https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Charity-sponsored research programs are also helping us to use translational concepts to greater effectiveness. The pipeline for SMA therapeutics comprises novel treatment modalities (antisense oligos and gene therapy) as well as classic drug discovery approaches to treatment development (Naryshkin et al., 2014Naryshkin N.A. Weetall M. Dakka A. Narasimhan J. Zhao X. Feng Z. Ling K.K. Karp G.M. Qi H. Woll M.G. et al.Science. 2014; 345: 688-693https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1250127Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar and Cherry et al., 2014Cherry J.J. Kobayashi D.T. Lynes M.M. Naryshkin N.N. Tiziano F.D. Zaworski P.G. Rubin L.L. Jarecki J. Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2014; 12: 315-341https://doi.org/10.1089/adt.2014.587Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Experimental medicine paradigms have been important to the advancement of the nucleotide-based treatments. Demonstrating the feasibility of these studies in infant patient populations has been an important development in pediatric research. In areas where treatments do exist such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, or mental illness, the quest for better and more precise therapies is still underway. Charities also support research to improve treatment outcomes, utilizing diverse methodologies from behavioral medicine, health implementation, and/or public health research. The National MS Society (http://www.nationalmssociety.org), for example, is supporting programs under the headings “Stop disease progression” and “Restore what has been lost” that cross research boundaries to include rehabilitation and psychological treatments. Charities can be important partners in the dissemination, adoption, and practice of innovation; the support of research targeting healthcare processes that take place after regulatory approval has high public value and should be taken seriously (Lloyd and White, 2011Lloyd K. White J. Nature. 2011; 474: 277-278https://doi.org/10.1038/474277aCrossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 3. Charities are critical to the development of patient resources needed in translational research. Publicly supported charities have long served as resources for people with an interest in participating in research. Now, translationally savvy charities are taking an activist role in supporting the development of resources needed for better characterization of disorders and more efficient clinical studies. Examples include the following:•Natural history studies to benchmark care and outcomes, such as the Pediatric Neuromuscular Clinical Research Network study for SMA (Kaufmann et al., 2012Kaufmann P. McDermott M.P. Darras B.T. Finkel R.S. Sproule D.M. Kang P.B. Oskoui M. Constantinescu A. Gooch C.L. Foley A.R. et al.Muscle Study Group (MSG)Pediatric Neuromuscular Clinical Research Network for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (PNCR)Neurology. 2012; 79: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar);•Biomarker projects—see MJFF for a discussion of Parkinson’s disease biomarker development and ADNI for more on neuroimaging biomarkers;•Registries for clinical trial recruitment. See the European Huntington’s Disease Network (http://www.euro-hd.net) supported by CHDI or FARA for examples of successful patient registry projects. A recent publication from the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (Workman, 2013Workman T.A. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [US], Rockville, MD2013Google Scholar) provides important perspective on the pros and cons of such projects. Biobanks are a critically important source of materials for genetic, molecular, and pathology studies; with the advent of cost-effective whole genome sequencing, more and more charities are supporting these fundamental studies to better describe disease. Classic examples of nonprofit supported endeavors include the previously mentioned Simons Simplex repository at SFARI or the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) supported by Autism Speaks (http://www.autismspeaks.org). The Genetic Alliance (http://www.geneticalliance.org), Faster Cures (http://www.fastercures.org), and other nonprofits are leading discussions on the ethical use of biosamples, patient data, and other sensitive information that people may wish to control. Data privacy concerns continue to evolve with technological advances such as the use of mobile device apps for personalized care. Translational neuroscience benefits from greater public knowledge, understanding, and dialogue on these important topics. 4. Charities help bring the patient voice to the research table. Patient input in the therapeutic development process, often coordinated by research charities, is critical to the future of translational neuroscience. Patient input has been used to help shape tolerability profiles and understand risk/benefit assessment for novel treatments. Consultations during the trial design process have led to improvements in recruitment efficiency and participant satisfaction (Ennis and Wykes, 2013Ennis L. Wykes T. Br. J. Psychiatry. 2013; 203: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Investigators and regulators recognize patient-reported outcome measures as important assessments in clinical trials—so much so that the NIH has devoted enormous resources to measure development through the PROMIS initiative (http://commonfund.nih.gov/promis/index). The movement to incorporate patient input into research priority setting is receiving greater attention: In the UK, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) has utilized charity-driven patient and public surveys to inform funding calls (Lloyd et al., 2012Lloyd K. White J. Chalmers I. Nature. 2012; 487: 432https://doi.org/10.1038/487432bCrossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI; http://www.pcori.org) (Frank et al., 2014Frank L. Basch E. Selby J.V. Patient-Centered Outcomes Research InstituteJAMA. 2014; 312: 1513-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) in the US has adopted similar methodologies in determining effectiveness research priorities. While ethics provide the rationale underpinning these efforts, it is still too early to tell how these investments are affecting attitudes toward research or research success. Neuroscience would do well to embrace and improve upon methods for patient and public input into research, as participatory research processes become a global standard. My own organization, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, is fast becoming a case study on the role of charities in translational neuroscience. Launched in 2013 with a founding grant from the Wellcome Trust, we are building de novo research and fundraising platforms that will fill a major gap in a sector where charity (and public) support for mental health research is virtually nonexistent. There are notable exceptions to this generalization, of course, like the organizations mentioned previously. A revolution in mental health care is unlikely, however, without a groundswell of public engagement, similar to that seen in cancer or HIV movements, where charity support and investment has been critical to translational successes. MQ is working to identify themes that will engage public support for mental health research, and we look to our colleagues in the sciences to help us accomplish that goal. Not surprisingly, the uncertainty around diagnostic criteria presents a challenge to the development of a new translational research program. With the RDoC experiment well underway, we are exploring alternate ways to contribute to better understanding of the mental illnesses. There is a wealth of resources in the UK—from cohort studies to the major government investment in Improving Access to Psychological Treatments program (IAPT)—which have generated patient and descriptive data that can be tapped to inform research; we hope to work with these resources in the near future. It is also clear that we will need to forge new research paradigms to address the inescapable fact that mental illness can be attributed to biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors, all or most of which can be the subject of intervention. Interdisciplinary approaches to mental health research are desperately needed, as is the leadership to bridge the gaps between disciplines. The recent call for a new interdisciplinary “mental health science” highlights both the opportunity and the challenges involved in forging connections across the sciences (Holmes et al., 2014Holmes E.A. Craske M.G. Graybiel A.M. Nature. 2014; 511: 287-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Neuroscience should be at the vanguard of these efforts; charities like MQ are poised to help. Here are some ideas we are incorporating in our thinking about new approaches to translational neuroscience:•Brain and behavior disorders are global problems for which solutions need to be global, too. Charities can help bridge boundaries between countries, organizations and processes.•Research programs need to be relevant to and understandable by patients and their families.•It’s more than neuroscience: A bio/psycho/social approach is needed for brain and behavior disorders.•It’s not just about drug development: Alongside drugs, effective interventions that will benefit from iterative neuroscience studies include psychological treatments; neuromodulation devices; social, environmental, and public health interventions and combinations thereof.•Regulatory approval is not the only endpoint: We need behavioral science to help us address important barriers to dissemination, adoption of innovation, treatment acceptance, and adherence among both patients and professionals. The call for a paradigm shift in our thinking about translational neuroscience research is essentially about adopting a truly iterative process, rather than paying lip service to it. We can no longer afford a straight-line approach to development, especially for therapies for complex disorders of the brain. In many ways, this community is still engaged in proof-of-principle studies to demonstrate that the translational model of therapeutic development, in all its iterative glory, works in neuroscience. At this time, it is simply the best plan on the table. Making this approach work for all types of interventions will be key to reducing the burden of disease, as will the involvement of all stakeholders in the process. The neurosciences are vital to helping us understand how biological, psychological, social, and environmental interventions work and their impact on quality of life. Charities can help bridge the gaps between the disciplines needed to reach these goals. Charities can help the neurosciences keep their eye on that prize—research that is relevant to real people in the real world. Indeed, in their work to get the best results from investments in neuroscience, charities may be among the most important players on the field.

The scale and complexity of this unmet need calls for a concomitantly large and sophisticated response. Here the author discusses just one element of such a response, the power of collaboration, and presents a personal account of how a variety of collaborative structures can advance science."
