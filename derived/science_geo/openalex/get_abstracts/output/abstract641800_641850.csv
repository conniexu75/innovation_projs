https://openalex.org/W2981683440,"Inferring the evolutionary history of cognitive abilities requires large and diverse samples. However, such samples are often beyond the reach of individual researchers or institutions, and studies are often limited to small numbers of species. Consequently, methodological and site-specific-differences across studies can limit comparisons between species. Here we introduce the ManyPrimates project, which addresses these challenges by providing a large-scale collaborative framework for comparative studies in primate cognition. To demonstrate the viability of the project we conducted a case study of short-term memory. In this initial study, we were able to include 176 individuals from 12 primate species housed at 11 sites across Africa, Asia, North America and Europe. All subjects were tested in a delayed-response task using consistent methodology across sites. Individuals could access food rewards by remembering the position of the hidden reward after a 0, 15, or 30-second delay. Overall, individuals performed better with shorter delays, as predicted by previous studies. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a strong phylogenetic signal for short-term memory. Although, with only 12 species, the validity of this analysis is limited, our initial results demonstrate the feasibility of a large, collaborative open-science project. We present the ManyPrimates project as an exciting opportunity to address open questions in primate cognition and behaviour with large, diverse datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2982278900,"Low-intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) has significant potential as a non-invasive brain stimulation modality and novel technique for functional brain mapping, particularly with its advantage of greater spatial selectivity and depth penetration compared to existing non-invasive brain stimulation techniques. As previous studies, primarily carried out in small animals, have demonstrated that sonication parameters affect the stimulation efficiency, further investigation in large animals is necessary to translate this technique into clinical practice. In the present study, we examined the effects of sonication parameters on the transient modification of excitability of cortical and thalamic areas in an ovine model. Guided by anatomical and functional neuroimaging data specific to each animal, 250 kHz FUS was transcranially applied to the primary sensorimotor area associated with the right hind limb and its thalamic projection in sheep (n = 10) across multiple sessions using various combinations of sonication parameters. The degree of effect from FUS was assessed through electrophysiological responses, through analysis of electromyogram and electroencephalographic somatosensory evoked potentials for evaluation of excitatory and suppressive effects, respectively. We found that the modulatory effects were transient and reversible, with specific sonication parameters outperforming others in modulating regional brain activity. Magnetic resonance imaging and histological analysis conducted at different time points after the final sonication session, as well as behavioral observations, showed that repeated exposure to FUS did not damage the underlying brain tissue. Our results suggest that FUS-mediated, non-invasive, region-specific bimodal neuromodulation can be safely achieved in an ovine model, indicating its potential for translation into human studies."
https://openalex.org/W2982261344,"Background In the midst of an opioid epidemic, health care workers are encountering an increasing number of patients who have opioid use disorder in addition to complex social, behavioral and medical issues. Of all the clinicians in the hospital, nurses spend the most time with hospitalized patients who have opioid use disorder, yet there has been little research exploring their experiences in caring for this population. The objective of this study was to assess the attitudes, perceptions, and training needs of nurses in the inpatient setting when caring for patients who have opioid use disorder. Methods One-on-one in-depth interviews were conducted with nurses working at a large academic medical center in Boston, MA, using a semi-structured interview guide. Nurses were recruited via email notifications and subsequent snowball sampling. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Results Data from in-depth interviews with 22 nurses were grouped into six themes: (1) stigma, (2) assessing & treating pain, (3) feelings of burn out, (4) communication between providers, (5) safety & security, and (6) opportunities for change. These themes were organized within four ecological levels of the Socio-Ecological Model: I) societal context, II) hospital environment, III) interpersonal interactions, and IV) individual factors. Nurses were cognizant of the struggles that patients who have opioid use disorder confront during hospitalization such as pain, withdrawal and stigma, and elaborated on how these challenges translate to professional and emotional strain among nurses. Nurses offered recommendations by which the hospital could streamline care for this population, including expanded role support for nurses and more structured policies regarding care for patients who present with a comorbid opioid use disorder. Conclusion Our results highlight the need for the development of programs targeting both organizational culture and the inpatient nurse quality of life to ultimately enhance quality of care for patients who present with opioid use disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2981822937,"Mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae provides a very promising alternative for producing carbohydrate-rich biomass to convert into bioethanol and value-added biocompounds, such as vitamins, pigments, proteins, lipids and antioxidant compounds. Spirulina platensis may present high yields of biomass and carbohydrates when it is grown under mixotrophic conditions using cheese whey. However, there are no previous studies evaluating the influence of this culture system on the profile of fatty acids or antioxidant compounds of this species, which are extremely important for food and pharmaceutical applications and would add value to the cultivation process. S. platensis presented higher specific growth rates, biomass productivity and carbohydrate content under mixotrophic conditions; however, the antioxidant capacity and the protein and lipid content were lower than that of the autotrophic culture. The maximum biomass yield was 2.98 ±0.07 g/L in growth medium with 5.0% whey. The phenolic compound concentration was the same for the biomass obtained under autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions with 2.5% and 5.0% whey. The phenolic compound concentrations showed no significant differences except for that in the growth medium with 10.0% whey, which presented an average value of 22.37±0.14 mg gallic acid/g. Mixotrophic cultivation of S. platensis using whey can be considered a viable alternative to reduce the costs of producing S. platensis biomass and carbohydrates, shorten cultivation time and produce carbohydrates, as it does not require adding expensive chemical nutrients to the growth medium and also takes advantage of cheese whey, an adverse dairy industry byproduct."
https://openalex.org/W2981481381,"As an important methyltransferase, G9a has been reported to be abnormally expressed in various human cancers and plays essential roles in tumorigenesis. However, the biologic functions and molecular mechanisms of G9a in gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear. GC is the fifth most frequent cancer around the world and seriously threatens human health, especially in developing countries. Here, our results showed that high expression of G9a was intensively correlated with poor prognosis and more advanced stages of GCs. Knockdown of G9a or treatment with its inhibitor, BIX01294, significantly reduced cell growth by cell cycle arrest and autophagy. In addition, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) was evidently decreased after G9a silencing or inhibition, and mTOR activation partially rescued the effects of cell proliferation inhibition and autophagy induced by G9a knockdown or inhibition. Down-regulation of G9a effectively inhibited mTOR expression and tumor growth in the xenograft tumor model of GC cells. We also showed that G9a regulates mTOR and cell proliferation and autophagy depending on its histone methylase activity. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we found that mTOR expression was associated with promoter methylation and an enrichment for mono- and dimethylated histone 3 lys 9 (H3K9). G9a knockdown revealed an apparent decrease in H3K9 monomethylation levels, but no apparent change in H3K9 dimethylation levels at the mTOR promoter. These results indicate that G9a is a novel and promising therapeutic target for GC treatment.-Yin, C., Ke, X., Zhang, R., Hou, J., Dong, Z., Wang, F., Zhang, K., Zhong, X., Yang, L., Cui, H. G9a promotes cell proliferation and suppresses autophagy in gastric cancer by directly activating mTOR."
https://openalex.org/W2981412762,"Early diagnosis and treatment of meningitis and encephalitis is essential for reducing both their morbidity and mortality. The FilmArray® Meningitis/Encephalitis (FA-M/E) panel is a recently available molecular tool allowing the simultaneous detection of 14 pathogens in about one hour. We evaluated its routine use over a 13-month period at Nîmes University Hospital, France. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were prospectively analyzed, independently of cell count; results were retrospectively analyzed and positive results compared to clinical and microbiological data. Among the 708 patients included (734 CSF samples), 89 (12.6%) had a positive FA-M/E panel, 71 (80%) for a viral pathogen and 18 (20%) for a bacterial pathogen. Enterovirus and HHV-6 were the main detected pathogens. Mean time-to-results was 1h46mn. Four non-clinically relevant results were detected (3 HHV-6 and 1 Haemophilus influenzae) on the basis of inconsistent clinical and/or biological data, and/or after visualization of melting curves. No CSF pleocytosis was observed in 11% of the patients with a positive FA-M/E panel. For the 18 patients with a positive FA-M/E panel for a bacterial pathogen, five (28%) had CSF samples showing a positive Gram stain allowing an early diagnosis of bacterial infection and 67% had CSF displaying a positive culture. Altogether the panel detected 5 cases of bacterial M/E (29%) not diagnosed by culture. Despite undeniable advantages, mainly ease of use, quick result availability, and an extremely low rate of invalid results, measures should be implemented to limit false-positive results due to contamination and a careful interpretation based on the overall data for each patient is required."
https://openalex.org/W2981918268,"To examine global gene expression response to profound metabolic and hormonal stress induced by acute sprint exercise.Healthy men and women (n = 14) performed three all-out cycle sprints interspersed by 20 min recovery. Muscle biopsies were obtained before the first, and 2h and 20 min after last sprint. Microarray analysis was performed to analyse acute gene expression response and repeated blood samples were obtained.In skeletal muscle, a set of immediate early genes, FOS, NR4A3, MAFF, EGR1, JUNB were markedly upregulated after sprint exercise. Gene ontology analysis from 879 differentially expressed genes revealed predicted activation of various upstream regulators and downstream biofunctions. Gene signatures predicted an enhanced turnover of skeletal muscle mass after sprint exercise and some novel induced genes such as WNT9A, FZD7 and KLHL40 were presented. A substantial increase in circulating free fatty acids (FFA) was noted after sprint exercise, in parallel with upregulation of PGC-1A and the downstream gene PERM1 and gene signatures predicting enhanced lipid turnover. Increase in growth hormone and insulin in blood were related to changes in gene expressions and both hormones were predicted as upstream regulators.This is the first study reporting global gene expression in skeletal muscle in response to acute sprint exercise and several novel findings are presented. First, in line with that muscle hypertrophy is not a typical finding after a period of sprint training, both hypertrophy and atrophy factors were regulated. Second, systemic FFA and hormonal and exposure might be involved in the sprint exercise-induced changes in gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2981654402,"This study aimed to systematically investigate the relation between gross motor skills and aspects of executive functioning (i.e. verbal working memory, visuospatial working memory, response inhibition and interference control) in 8-10 year old children. Additionally, the role of information processing (speed and variability) and lapses of attention in the relation between gross motor skills and executive functions was investigated. Data of 732 Dutch children from grade 3 and 4 were analyzed (50.0% boys, 50.4% grade 3, age = 9.16 ± 0.64 years). Gross motor skills were assessed using three items of the Körper Koordinationstest für Kinder and one item of the Bruininks-Oseretsky test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition. Executive functions were assessed using the Wechsler Digit Span task (verbal working memory), the Visuospatial Memory task (visuospatial working memory), the Stop Signal task (response inhibition) and a modified version of the Flanker task (interference control). Information processing and lapses of attention were obtained by applying an ex-Gaussian analysis on go trials of the Stop Signal task. Multilevel regression analysis showed that gross motor skills were significantly related to verbal working memory, visuospatial working memory and response inhibition, but not to interference control. Lapses of attention was a significant predictor for all executive functions, whereas processing speed was not. Variability in processing speed was only predictive for visuospatial working memory. After controlling for information processing and lapses of attention, gross motor skills were only significantly related to visuospatial working memory and response inhibition. The results suggest that after controlling for information processing and lapses of attention, gross motor skills are related to aspects of executive functions that are most directly involved in, and share common underlying processes with, gross motor skills."
https://openalex.org/W2981540187,"Even when successfully surviving an infection, a host often fails to eliminate a pathogen completely and may sustain substantial pathogen burden for the remainder of its life. Using systemic bacterial infection in Drosophila melanogaster, we characterize chronic infection by three bacterial species from different genera - Providencia rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, and Enterococcus faecalis-following inoculation with a range of doses. To assess the consequences of these chronic infections, we determined the expression of antimicrobial peptide genes, survival of secondary infection, and starvation resistance after one week of infection. While higher infectious doses unsurprisingly lead to higher risk of death, they also result in higher chronic bacterial loads among the survivors for all three infections. All three chronic infections caused significantly elevated expression of antimicrobial peptide genes at one week post-infection and provided generalized protection again secondary bacterial infection. Only P. rettgeri infection significantly influenced resistance to starvation, with persistently infected flies dying more quickly under starvation conditions relative to controls. These results suggest that there is potentially a generalized mechanism of protection against secondary infection, but that other impacts on host physiology may depend on the specific pathogen. We propose that chronic infections in D. melanogaster could be a valuable tool for studying tolerance of infection, including impacts on host physiology and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2981420595,"Background Despite an increase in emphasis on psychosocial care in cancer nursing, time constraints and nurses’ lack of knowledge in skilled communication continue to be challenges. Aims To examine how cancer care nurses view their communication with patients and how they deal with the psychosocial needs of patients in busy wards. Design A qualitative interview study. Methods Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with eleven hospital-based cancer nurses in Hong Kong from July 2, 2017 to January 2, 2018. Results A qualitative thematic analysis of the data identified three themes: 1. Intentional and unintentional psychosocial care that is secondary in focus; 2. Managing an emotionally challenged environment; 3. Mentoring and learning. Conclusion Oncology settings are time-constrained, emotionally charged environments for nurses, and providing psychosocial care for patients is a secondary concern. While proactive strategies can be used to avert patient complaints, being open and attending to the individual needs of patients is equally important to avoid blocking in nurse-patient communication. Despite emotional entanglement and tensions, the positive follow-up strategies used by nurses to manage the patients’ emotions and provide psychosocial care reflect good practices. Leadership and support are needed to deal with the nurses’ perception that their communication training has been ineffective and their ability to manage strong emotions deficient. Communication skills, honed by making continuous opportunities to communicate available, as well as an understanding of emotional labour, need to be integrated with mindfulness in the nurses’ care of themselves and their patients. Notwithstanding the importance of experience in oncology care for junior nurses, it is necessary for both junior and senior nurses to learn about and reflect upon the different forms of emotional labour if value-based care is to be provided. In addition, it is essential for junior nurses to receive continuous coaching and mentoring, and to engage in reflective learning from each clinical encounter with oncology patients."
https://openalex.org/W2981511682,"Microbiological activity is an important parameter for understanding the functioning of different environments. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to estimate the quantity and contribution of metabolically active at the single-cell level bacteria in the microbial community in peat-bog lakes. To determine different aspects of the metabolic activity of bacteria, four fluorescent staining methods (Dehydrogenase/Electron Transport System Activity -CTC+, Nucleoid Containing Cells- NuCC+, Active Bacteria with Intact Ribosome Structures- RIB+ and Active Bacteria With an Intact Membrane-MEM+) were applied. We identified four natural peat-bog lakes in Northern Europe to determine which factors-community (bacterial factors) or environment (hydrochemical and physical factors)-have a significant influence on the quantitative dynamics of metabolically active microorganisms, in terms of seasonal and habitat changes. The results show that change in the amount of abiotic components such as DOC, TN, and TOC can result in stress, which may limit a function but does not lead to losing all other metabolic functions in the community-forming bacteria. In nutrient-poor peat bog lakes, nutrients and organic carbon are factors which regulate the overall activity of the community."
https://openalex.org/W2981795654,"Galls are plant structures generated by gall-inducing organisms including insects, nematodes, fungi, bacteria and viruses. Those made by insects generally consist of inner callus-like cells surrounded by lignified hard cells, supplying both nutrients and protection to the gall insects living inside. This indicates that gall insects hijack developmental processes in host plants to generate tissues for their own use. Although galls are morphologically diverse, the molecular mechanism for their development remains poorly understood. To identify genes involved in gall development, we performed RNA-sequencing based transcriptome analysis for leaf galls. We examined the young and mature galls of Glochidion obovatum (Phyllanthaceae), induced by the micromoth Caloptilia cecidophora (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), the leaf gall from Eurya japonica (Pentaphylacaceae) induced by Borboryctis euryae (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), and the strawberry-shaped leaf gall from Artemisia montana (Asteraceae) induced by gall midge Rhopalomyia yomogicola (Oligotrophini: Cecidomyiidae). Gene ontology (GO) analyses suggested that genes related to developmental processes are up-regulated, whereas ones related to photosynthesis are down-regulated in these three galls. Comparison of transcripts in these three galls together with the gall on leaves of Rhus javanica (Anacardiaceae), induced by the aphid Schlechtendalia chinensis (Hemiptera: Aphidoidea), suggested 38 genes commonly up-regulated in galls from different plant species. GO analysis showed that peptide biosynthesis and metabolism are commonly involved in the four different galls. Our results suggest that gall development involves common processes across gall inducers and plant taxa, providing an initial step towards understanding how they manipulate host plant developmental systems."
https://openalex.org/W2981996329,"The mitochondrial complexes are prone to sirtuin (Sirt)3-mediated deacetylation modification, which may determine cellular response to stimuli, such as oxidative stress. In this study, we show that the cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-1, a core catalytic subunit of mitochondrial complex IV, was acetylated and deactivated both in 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride-treated NIH/3T3 cells and hydrogen peroxide-treated primary neuronal cells, correlating with apoptotic cell death induction by oxidative stress. Inhibition of Sirt3 by small interfering RNA or the inhibitor nicotinamide induced accumulation of acetylation of COX-1, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased cell apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of Sirt3 enhanced deacetylation of COX-1 and inhibited oxidative stress-induced apoptotic cell death. Significantly, rats treated with ischemia/reperfusion injury, a typical oxidative stress-related disease, presented an inhibition of Sirt3-induced hyperacetylation of COX-1 in the brain tissues. Furthermore, K13, K264, K319, and K481 were identified as the acetylation sits of COX-1 in response to oxidative stress. In conclusion, COX-1 was discovered as a new deacetylation target of Sirt3, indicating that the Sirt3/COX-1 axis is a promising therapy target of stress-related diseases.-Tu, L.-F., Cao, L.-F., Zhang, Y.-H., Guo, Y.-L., Zhou, Y.-F., Lu, W.-Q., Zhang, T.-Z., Zhang, T., Zhang, G.-X., Kurihara, H., Li, Y.-F., He, R.-R.

https://openalex.org/W2981912859,"Tuned liquid column ball damper (TLCBD) is a passive control device used for controlling the building vibrations induced from wind or earthquakes. TLCBD is a modified form of conventional tuned liquid column damper (TLCD). This paper studies the effect of TLCBD on the four-storey steel frame structure. The performance of the TLCBD is also compared with conventional TLCD. The analytical model of both TLCD and TLCBD is presented here. The effectiveness of these analytical models is examined experimentally by series of shaking table tests under different excitation levels including harmonic loadings and seismic excitations. In TLCBD, the vibration is reduced significantly as compared to TLCD by using steel ball as a moving orifice. The difference in diameter of steel ball and tube, containing the liquid column, acts as an orifice which moves with the movement of the ball. This moving orifice phenomenon enhanced the vibration reduction effect by resisting the water motion in the TLCBD. Root mean square (RMS) and peak values of acceleration were calculated for each loading and each storey of uncontrolled and controlled structures. Comparison of the time histories of controlled and uncontrolled structures for different loadings is also reported. Results indicate that the TLCBD is more effective in the earthquake scenarios as compared to the harmonic excitations. The TLCBD controls the vibration of the primary structure significantly in vibration reduction."

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a social media intervention (i.e. weekly prenatal health messages) on improving diet quality, and health beliefs and knowledge. Participants (10 adolescents and 12 adults) completed pre-post intervention interviews, nutrition knowledge and health belief questionnaires, and 24-hour diet recalls. Participants entering pregnancy as overweight or obese were more likely to experience excessive GWG during the intervention. The adults had greater participation during the study despite high levels of social media access among both groups. Participants were able to identify sugar-sweetened foods and acknowledged the benefits of whole grains; however, overall knowledge of MyPlate Guidelines was limited. Social media-based education was well received by participants but did not result in large changes in dietary intake and knowledge. Although larger studies are needed, social media appears to have the potential to reach high-risk women."
https://openalex.org/W2981353467,"Francisella tularensis is a Gram-negative bacterium responsible for causing tularemia in the northern hemisphere. F. tularensis has long been developed as a biological weapon due to its ability to cause severe illness upon inhalation of as few as ten organisms and, based on its potential to be used as a bioterror agent is now classified as a Tier 1 Category A select agent by the CDC. The stringent response facilitates bacterial survival under nutritionally challenging starvation conditions. The hallmark of stringent response is the accumulation of the effector molecules ppGpp and (p)ppGpp known as stress alarmones. The relA and spoT gene products generate alarmones in several Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. RelA is a ribosome-associated ppGpp synthetase that gets activated under amino acid starvation conditions whereas, SpoT is a bifunctional enzyme with both ppGpp synthetase and ppGpp hydrolase activities. Francisella encodes a monofunctional RelA and a bifunctional SpoT enzyme. Previous studies have demonstrated that stringent response under nutritional stresses increases expression of virulence-associated genes encoded on Francisella Pathogenicity Island. This study investigated how stringent response governs the oxidative stress response of F. tularensis. We demonstrate that RelA/SpoT-mediated ppGpp production alters global gene transcriptional profile of F. tularensis in the presence of oxidative stress. The lack of stringent response in relA/spoT gene deletion mutants of F. tularensis makes bacteria more susceptible to oxidants, attenuates survival in macrophages, and virulence in mice. This work is an important step forward towards understanding the complex regulatory network underlying the oxidative stress response of F. tularensis."
https://openalex.org/W2982154644,"Patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) experience impaired physical function and reduced quality of life, which puts this group at high risk for depression. Identifying factors associated with depressive symptoms could improve outcomes for this at-risk group. However, few studies have examined the relationship between demographic and clinical variables and depressive symptoms in patients with AS. This cross-sectional correlation study recruited patients with AS by convenience sampling from the division of immunology and rheumatology of a medical center in Northern Taiwan. Participants (N = 120) included 91 males and 29 females, age ≥ 20 years. Data were collected from chart reviews, and structural questionnaires, which included demographic information regarding employment status, history of falls, impact of AS on work; clinical information relative to AS was obtained from structural questionnaires: the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and functional index (BASFI), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Body Image Scale (BIS), and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Multiple regression analysis identified predictors of depression. The mean BDI-II score was 9.50 ± 8.30; 25% had scores indicating mild to severe depressive symptoms. Mean score on the BIS was 68.17 ± 16.14; 14.2% had fallen within the previous year; and 57.5% reported AS affected their work. Variables associated with depressive symptoms were work affected by AS (β = 0.14, p = .049), occurrence of a fall within the previous year (β = 0.14, p = .032), higher scores on the BASDAI (β = 0.21, p = .032), and lower body image (β = -0.38, p < .001). Clinical professionals should regularly assess patients with AS for depressive symptoms. Health care planning should provide instruction in fall prevention and control of disease activity, and strategies to improve body image, which could improve patients' self-management capabilities and body image as well as mitigate depressive symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2982207437,"Arraying individual extracellular vesicles (EVs) on a chip is expected one of the promising approaches for investigating their inherent properties. In this study, we immobilized individual EVs on a surface using a nanopatterned tethering chip-based versatile platform. A microfluidic device was used to ensure soft, reproducible exposure of the EVs over the whole chip surface. The device is incorporated with a high-density nanoarray chip patterned with 200-nm diameter nanospots composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid conjugate brushes. We present a procedure adopted for fabricating high-density PEG-lipid modified nanospots (200 nmϕ, 5.0 × 105 spots/mm2 in 2 × 2 mm2 area). This procedure involves nanopatterning using electron beam lithography, followed by multistep selective chemical modification. Aqueous treatment of a silane coupling agent, used as a linker between PEG-lipid molecules and the silicon surface, was the key step that enabled surface modification using a nanopatterned resist film as a mask. The nanoarray chip was removed from the device for subsequent measurements such as atomic force microscopy (AFM). We developed a prototype device and individually immobilized EVs derived from different cell lines (Sk-Br-3 and HEK293) on tethering nanospots. We characterized EV's morphology using AFM and showed the possibility of evaluating the deformability of EVs using the aspect ratio as an indicator."
https://openalex.org/W2981544237,"The ability to make transgenic Hydra lines has allowed for quantitative in vivo studies of Hydra regeneration and physiology. These studies commonly include excision, grafting and transplantation experiments along with high-resolution imaging of live animals, which can be challenging due to the animal’s response to touch and light stimuli. While various anesthetics have been used in Hydra studies, they tend to be toxic over the course of a few hours or their long-term effects on animal health are unknown. Here, we show that the monoterpenoid alcohol linalool is a useful anesthetic for Hydra. Linalool is easy to use, non-toxic, fast acting, and reversible. It has no detectable long-term effects on cell viability or cell proliferation. We demonstrate that the same animal can be immobilized in linalool multiple times at intervals of several hours for repeated imaging over 2–3 days. This uniquely allows for in vivo imaging of dynamic processes such as head regeneration. We directly compare linalool to currently used anesthetics and show its superior performance. Linalool will be a useful tool for tissue manipulation and imaging in Hydra research in both research and teaching contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2982277942,"Dung beetles are secondary seed dispersers, incidentally moving many of the seeds defecated by mammals vertically (seed burial) and/or horizontally as they process and relocate dung. Although several studies have quantified this ecological function of dung beetles, very few have followed seed fate until seedling establishment, and most of these have focused on the effects of seed burial. We know very little about the effects of horizontal seed movement by dung beetles, though it is generally assumed that it will affect plant recruitment positively through diminishing seed clumping. The objective of our study was to assess the effects of dung beetle activity on the spatial distribution of seeds and seedlings, and on the probability of seedling establishment. In a tropical rainforest in Mexico we carried out two complementary field experiments for each of two tree species (Bursera simaruba and Poulsenia armata), using seeds experimentally imbedded in pig dung and recording their fate and spatial location over time. For both species, dung beetle activity reduced the spatial clumping of seeds and seedlings; however, it did not increase the probability of seedling establishment. We discuss the context- and species-specificity of the combined effects of horizontal and vertical dispersal of seeds by dung beetles, and the need to quantify long-term seedling fates to more accurately determine the effects of seed movement by dung beetles on plant recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W2981348979,"Sigma power during sleep is associated with cognitive abilities in healthy humans. We examined the relationship between sigma power in sleep EEG and intelligence and alertness in schoolchildren with ADHD (n = 17) in comparison to mentally healthy children (n = 16) and adults (n = 23). We observed a positive correlation between sigma power in sleep stage 2 and IQ in healthy adults but a negative correlation in children with ADHD. Furthermore, children with ADHD showed slower reaction times in alertness testing than both control groups. In contrast, only healthy children displayed a positive correlation between sigma power and reaction times. These data suggest that the associations between sigma power and cognitive performance underlie distinct developmental processes. A negative association between IQ and sigma power indicates a disturbed function of sleep in cognitive functions in ADHD, whereas the function of sleep appears to be matured early in case of motor-related alertness performance."
https://openalex.org/W2981508818,"Mediterranean wetlands are critical strongholds for biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem functions and services; yet, they are being severely degraded by a number of socio-economic drivers and pressures, including climate change. Moreover, we still lack comprehensive understanding of the extent to which biodiversity loss in Mediterranean wetlands will accelerate change in ecosystem processes. Here, we evaluate how changes in biodiversity can alter the ecosystem of the Camargue (southern France). We collected data on species presence/absence, trends and abundance over a 40-year period by combining observations from the scholarly literature with insights derived from expert knowledge. In total, we gathered more than 1500 estimates of presence/absence, over 1400 estimates of species abundance, and about 1400 estimates of species trends for eight taxonomic groups, i.e. amphibians, reptiles, breeding birds, fish, mammals, dragonflies (odonates), orthopterans and vascular plants. Furthermore, we used information on recently arrived species and invasive species to identify compositional changes across multiple taxa. Complementing targeted literature searches with expert knowledge allowed filling important gaps regarding the status and trends of biodiversity in the Camargue. Species trend data revealed sharp population declines in amphibians, odonates and orthopterans, while birds and plants experienced an average increase in abundance between the 1970s and the 2010s. The general increasing trends of novel and invasive species is suggested as an explanation for the changing abundance of birds and plants. While the observed declines in certain taxa reflect the relative failure of the protection measures established in the Camargue, the increasing exposure to novel and invasive species reveal major changes in the community structure of the different taxonomic groups. This study is the first attempt to assess changes in biodiversity in the Camargue using an expert knowledge approach, and can help manage the uncertainties and complexities associated with rapid social-ecological change in other Mediterranean wetlands."
https://openalex.org/W2981739231,"Enzyme recruitment is a fundamental evolutionary driver of modern metabolism. We see evidence of recruitment at work in the metabolic Molecular Ancestry Networks (MANET) database, an online resource that integrates data from KEGG, SCOP and structural phylogenomic reconstruction. The database, which was introduced in 2006, traces the deep history of the structural domains of enzymes in metabolic pathways. Here we release version 3.0 of MANET, which updates data from KEGG and SCOP, links enzyme and PDB information with PDBsum, and traces evolutionary information of domains defined at fold family level of SCOP classification in metabolic subnetwork diagrams. Compared to SCOP folds used in the previous versions, fold families are cohesive units of functional similarity that are highly conserved at sequence level and offer a 10-fold increase of data entries. We surveyed enzymatic, functional and catalytic site distributions among superkingdoms showing that ancient enzymatic innovations followed a biphasic temporal pattern of diversification typical of module innovation. We grouped enzymatic activities of MANET into a hierarchical system of subnetworks and mesonetworks matching KEGG classification. The evolutionary growth of these modules of metabolic activity was studied using bipartite networks and their one-mode projections at enzyme, subnetwork and mesonetwork levels of organization. Evolving metabolic networks revealed patterns of enzyme sharing that transcended mesonetwork boundaries and supported the patchwork model of metabolic evolution. We also explored the scale-freeness, randomness and small-world properties of evolving networks as possible organizing principles of network growth and diversification. The network structure shows an increase in hierarchical modularity and scale-free behavior as metabolic networks unfold in evolutionary time. Remarkably, this evolutionary constraint on structure was stronger at lower levels of metabolic organization. Evolving metabolic structure reveals a ‘principle of granularity’, an evolutionary increase of the cohesiveness of lower-level parts of a hierarchical system.

https://openalex.org/W2981849374,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) induces changes in cortical excitability for minutes to hours after the end of intervention. However, it has not been precisely determined to what extent cortical plasticity prevails spatially in the cortex. Recent studies have shown that rTMS induces changes in “interhemispheric” functional connectivity, the resting-state functional connectivity between the stimulated region and the symmetrically corresponding region in the contralateral hemisphere. In the present study, quadripulse stimulation (QPS) was applied to the index finger representation in the left primary motor cortex (M1), while the position of the stimulation coil was constantly monitored by an online navigator. After QPS application, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and the interhemispheric functional connectivity was compared with that before QPS. A cluster of connectivity changes was observed in the stimulated region in the central sulcus. The cluster was spatially extended approximately 10 mm from the center [half width at half maximum (HWHM): approximately 3 mm] and was extended approximately 20 mm long in depth (HWHM: approximately 7 mm). A localizer scan of the index finger motion confirmed that the cluster of interhemispheric connectivity changes overlapped spatially with the activation related to the index finger motion. These results indicate that cortical plasticity in M1 induced by rTMS was relatively restricted in space and suggest that rTMS can reveal functional dissociation associated with adjacent small areas by inducing neural plasticity in restricted cortical regions."
https://openalex.org/W2982101645,"Gait disturbance is a major symptom of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and is assessed by raters of different professions or with different degrees of experience. Agreement studies are usually done by two raters or more, and comparisons among multiple groups of raters are rare. In this study, we aimed to examine the agreement among multiple groups of raters on gait patterns and a grading scale through a video-assisted gait analysis in patients with iNPH. Fifteen participants with iNPH were enrolled. Gait was assessed according to seven patterns, including freezing and wide-based gaits. The levels of severity (evident, mild, none) were rated by three groups of raters (two neurosurgeons [DR2], three experienced physiotherapists [PTe3], and two less experienced physiotherapists [PTl2]) through a simultaneous video viewing session. Severity of gait disturbance (GSg) was rated using the Japanese iNPH grading scaleiNPHGS, and Krippendorff alpha was computed to assess agreement, with alpha ≥0.667 indicating good agreement and alpha ≥0.8 indicating excellent agreement. For group comparisons, 84%, not 95%, confidence intervals were applied. Among the seven gait patterns in the first assessment, excellent agreement was observed in wide-based and short-stepped gaits in only DR2. Good agreement was observed in four patterns, but the agreement by two groups was in shuffling and wide-based gait. There were no gait patterns showing good agreement among three groups. In the second assessment, excellent agreement was observed in three patterns but no gait patterns showed good agreement between two groups or more. Learning effect was observed only for standing difficulty in DR2. In contrast, good or nearly good agreement on GSg was observed among the three groups with excellent agreement in two groups. Agreement on gait patterns among the three groups of raters was not high, but agreement on the iNPHGS was high, indicating the importance of a precise description facilitating differentiation between neighboring grades."

Semantic and sentiment analysis of these social multimedia have become key research topics in many areas in society, e.g., in shopping malls to help policymakers predict market trends and discover potential customers. In this light, this study proposes a novel method to analyze the emotional aspects of Chinese vocabulary and then to assess the mass comments of the movie reviews. The experiment results show that our method 1. can improve the machine learning model by providing more refined emotional information to enhance the effectiveness of movie recommendation systems, and 2. performs significantly better than the other commonly used methods of emotional analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2981394741,"High tibial medial open-wedge osteotomy (HTO) is an established treatment option for cartilage lesions in the medial compartment. It was this study's aim to evaluate the effect of asymptomatic single or kissing lesions in the lateral compartment on functional outcome after medial open-wedge osteotomy. A total of 156 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. All patients underwent HTO due to a varus deformity and a symptomatic cartilage lesion or osteoarthritis in the medial compartment. We acquired preoperative Lysholm and VAS Scores. Each open-wedge osteotomy was preceded by diagnostic arthroscopy to ensure the compartments were thoroughly documented and diagnosed. Cartilage lesions in the lateral compartment were evaluated, and three groups created according to their individual characteristics: group A (no cartilage lesion, n = 119), group B (single cartilage lesion, n = 16) and group C (kissing lesions, n = 21). Cartilage lesions were graded according to the Outerbridge classification, The functional postoperative outcome was determined by relying on several parameters (VAS Score, Lysholm, KOOS, WOMAC Score). Pre- and postoperative long-leg axis views were analyzed via special planning software (mediCAD, Hectec GmbH Germany). Mean follow-up was at 69.0 ± 30.3 months after surgery (range 22 to 121 months). There were no significant differences between the three groups in the correction angle chosen (p = 0.16). Regarding the outcome parameters, group A attained the best results in the WOMACpain Score (p = 0.03) and WOMACfunction Score (p = 0.05). A higher Outerbridge-Score of cartilage lesions in the lateral compartment was associated with a higher (i.e., worse) WOMACpain Score (p = 0.018) and WOMACfunction Score (p = 0.033). In all the groups (A, B, and C), HTO led to a significant improvement in the Lysholm Score (p < 0.001) and to a decrease in pain level (VAS Score; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Valgus high tibial osteotomy leads to reduced pain and improved functional outcome scores, even in patients with pre-existing asymptomatic single or corresponding cartilage lesions in the lateral compartment. In case of severe cartilage lesions in the lateral compartment, surgeons should consider that clinical outcome worsens depending on the Outerbridge Score."
https://openalex.org/W2981966027,"Background Anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) is one of the most frequent non-AIDS-defining neoplasias in HIV patients, mainly in MSM, and it has been associated with chronic infection with high-risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV). Our main objective was to determine HR-HPV clearance and acquisition rates and related factors and their relationship with the incidence of HSILs and ASCC in anal mucosa of HIV+ MSM. Patients and methods The study included consecutive HIV-infected MSM between May 2010 and December 2018. Data were gathered at baseline and annually on their sexual behavior, CD4 and CD8 levels, plasma HIV viral load, and results of anal cytology, HPV PCR, and high-resolution anoscopy. Results Out of the 405 patients studied, 34.9% of patients cleared oncogenic genotypes (IQR: 37–69) within 49 months, and 42.9% acquired new genotypes within 36 months (IQR:12–60). In multivariate analysis, clearance was only significantly influenced by the duration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (OR: 1.016, 95% CI 1.003–1.030). The incidence of HSILs was 30.86/1,000 patient-years and that of ASCC was 81.22/100,000 patient-years; these incidences were not influenced by the acquisition (acquired: 14.9% vs. non-acquired: 10.4%; p = 0.238) or clearance (cleared 11.4% vs. non-cleared: 13.2%; p = 0.662) rates of these viruses. Conclusions The duration of ART appears to positively affect oncogenic genotype clearance in the anal mucosa of HIV+ MSM, although this clearance does not affect the incidence of HSILs or ASCC. The reduction in HSIL+ rate observed in our patients may be attributable to the bundle of measures adopted at our center."
https://openalex.org/W2982000187,"Negative emotionality (NE) and positive emotionality (PE) have repeatedly shown to act as vulnerability factors for youth depression. Less research examined the mechanisms through which these reactive temperament traits may differently confer vulnerability to depression. Based on recent integrated models of depression proposing emotion regulation as a key underlying mechanism, the current study aimed to clarify the general and day-to-day relations among temperament, emotion regulation strategies, and depressive symptoms in Dutch-speaking youth (35% boys; Mage = 13.27 years, SD = 1.98) using a cross-sectional (n = 495) and a 7-day daily diary design (n = 469). Self-reported temperament, trait rumination, trait positive refocusing, and depressive symptoms were measured at baseline. State rumination, state positive refocusing, and depressive symptoms were further assessed daily. Whereas results revealed that NE and PE interacted in predicting baseline and daily depressive symptoms, the cross-sectional analyses provide preliminary evidence for the hypothesis that NE and PE each provide unique pathways for understanding vulnerability to depression. Additional analyses in the daily diary study showed NE to be significantly related to trajectories of state rumination. Results contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the associations between temperament, emotion regulation strategies, and depressive symptoms in youth."
https://openalex.org/W2981920802,"Glutaredoxin-1 (Glrx) is a small cytosolic enzyme that removes S-glutathionylation, glutathione adducts of protein cysteine residues, thus modulating redox signaling and gene transcription. Although Glrx up-regulation prevented endothelial cell (EC) migration and global Glrx transgenic mice had impaired ischemic vascularization, the effects of cell-specific Glrx overexpression remained unknown. Here, we examined the role of EC-specific Glrx up-regulation in distinct models of angiogenesis; namely, hind limb ischemia and tumor angiogenesis. EC-specific Glrx transgenic (EC-Glrx TG) overexpression in mice significantly impaired EC migration in Matrigel implants and hind limb revascularization after femoral artery ligation. Additionally, ECs migrated less into subcutaneously implanted B16F0 melanoma tumors as assessed by decreased staining of EC markers. Despite reduced angiogenesis, EC-Glrx TG mice unexpectedly developed larger tumors compared with control mice. EC-Glrx TG mice showed higher levels of VEGF-A in the tumors, indicating hypoxia, which may stimulate tumor cells to form vascular channels without EC, referred to as vasculogenic mimicry. These data suggest that impaired ischemic vascularization does not necessarily associate with suppression of tumor growth, and that antiangiogenic therapies may be ineffective for melanoma tumors because of their ability to implement vasculogenic mimicry during hypoxia.-Yura, Y., Chong, B.

https://openalex.org/W2982076296,"Physical exercise is known to activate the sympathetic nervous system, which influences the production of saliva from salivary glands. Our examination of saliva collected from highly trained athletes before and after a number of physical competititions showed an increase in the secretion of S-type cystatins and cystatin C as a subacute response to aerobic and anaerobic exercise. The elevation in salivary cystatins was transient and the recovery time course differed from that of amylase and other salivary proteins. An in vitro assay was developed based on a cell line from a human submandibular gland (HSG) that differentiated into acinus-like structures. Treatments with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol caused a shift in the intracellular distribution of S-type cystatins and cystatin C, promoting their accumulation at the outer regions of the acinus prior to release and suggesting the activation of a directional transport involving co-migration of both molecules. In another treatment using non-differentiated HSG cells, it was evident that both expression and secretion of cystatin C increased upon addition of the β-adrenergic agonist, and these effects were essentially eliminated by the antagonist propranolol. The HSG cell line appears to have potential as a model for exploring the mechanism of cystatin secretion, particularly the S-type cystatins that originate primarily in the submandibular glands."

Important histopathological diagnostic criteria are nuclear shapes and chromatin distribution as well as nucleus-cytoplasm relation and immunohistochemical properties of surface and intracellular proteins. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of three-dimensional imaging of CD30+ cells in classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) in comparison to CD30+ lymphoid cells in reactive lymphoid tissues.Using immunoflourescence confocal microscopy and computer-based analysis, we compared CD30+ neoplastic cells in Nodular Sclerosis cHL (NScCHL), Mixed Cellularity cHL (MCcHL), with reactive CD30+ cells in Adenoids (AD) and Lymphadenitis (LAD). We confirmed that the percentage of CD30+ cell volume can be calculated. The amount in lymphadenitis was approx. 1.5%, in adenoids around 2%, in MCcHL up to 4,5% whereas the values for NScHL rose to more than 8% of the total cell cytoplasm. In addition, CD30+ tumour cells (HRS-cells) in cHL had larger volumes, and more protrusions compared to CD30+ reactive cells. Furthermore, the formation of large cell networks turned out to be a typical characteristic of NScHL.In contrast to 2D histology, 3D laser scanning offers a visualisation of complete cells, their network interaction and spatial distribution in the tissue. The possibility to differentiate cells in regards to volume, surface, shape, and cluster formation enables a new view on further diagnostic and biological questions. 3D includes an increased amount of information as a basis of bioinformatical calculations."
https://openalex.org/W2981682247,"Research using animals is controversial. To develop sound public outreach and policy about this issue, we need information about both the underlying science and people’s attitudes and knowledge. To identify attitudes toward this subject at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, we developed and administered a survey to undergraduate students and faculty. The survey asked respondents about the importance of, their confidence in their knowledge about, and who they trusted to provide information on animal research. Findings indicated attitudes varied by academic discipline, especially among faculty. Faculty in the biological sciences, particularly those who had participated in an animal research project, reported the issue to be most important, and they reported greater confidence in their knowledge about pro and con arguments. Among students, being female, a vegetarian/vegan, or participating in animal research were associated with higher ratings of importance. Confidence in knowledge about regulation and its adequacy was very low across all groups except biological science faculty. Both students and faculty identified university courses and spokespersons to be the most trusted sources of information about animal research. UW-Madison has a long history of openness about animal research, which correlates with the high level of trust by students and faculty. Nevertheless, confidence in knowledge about animal research and its regulation remains limited, and both students and faculty indicated their desire to receive more information from courses and spokespersons. Based on these findings, we argue that providing robust university-wide outreach and course-based content about animal research should be considered an organizational best practice, in particular for colleges and universities."

Totally, 297 nurses working in the ICU at King Saud University Medical City completed a survey on medical devices and adverse events reporting and 198 reported experiencing an adverse event related to equipment failure. However, 195 nurses were unaware of an official national reporting system for reporting such events.

https://openalex.org/W2982226771,"Social play is associated with the experience of positive emotions in higher vertebrates and may be used as a measure of animal welfare. Altering motivation to play (e.g., through short-term social isolation) can temporarily affect play levels between familiar individuals, a process which may involve emotional contagion. This study investigated how forming groups based on known differences in the personality trait “playfulness” (i.e., the longer-term propensity of an individual to actively play from adolescence to early adulthood) affects social play. Seventy-six adolescent male Lister Hooded rats underwent a Play-in-Pairs test assessing their playfulness, ranked as high (H), intermediate (I) or low (L). At seven weeks of age, rats were resorted into homogenous groups of similar (LLL, III, HHH), or heterogeneous groups of dissimilar (HII, LII) playfulness. Social play was scored in the home cage at Weeks 8, 10, 12 of age. A second Play-in-Pairs test was performed (Week 11) to assess consistency of playfulness. A Social Preference test investigated whether I rats in heterogeneous groups preferred proximity with I, H or L cage mates. It was found that heterogeneous groups played less than homogeneous ones at adolescence (8 weeks of age), while play levels at early adulthood (Weeks 10 and 12) did not differ between groups. Play in the homogeneous groups decreased with age as expected, while it did not change over time in the heterogeneous groups, which did not compensate for the lower play levels shown at adolescence. Play-in-Pairs scores before and after resorting were mildly correlated, indicating some level of consistency over time despite the resorting procedure. In the Social Preference test, subjects did not prefer one playfulness level over another. We conclude that a mismatch in playfulness may negatively affect social play development, and thus the welfare, of rats. Groups made of animals with similar playfulness, even those initially scoring relatively low in this trait, seemed to be more successful in establishing play relationships during adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2981507180,"Mycosis Fungoides (MF) is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Early stage patients are treated with topical therapies and have normal life expectancy whereas patients with advanced disease encounter frequent relapses and have a five-year survival rate that does not exceed 15%. The aim of the present study was to characterize the expression of microRNA-16 (miR-16) and microRNA-93 (miR-93) in early and advanced cases of MF in relation to the clinicopathological parameters. Ten skin biopsies of early and advanced MF were investigated for the expression of miR-16 and miR-93 using RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical expression of apoptosis markers (BCL-2 and Survivin) were also investigated in the studied cases compared to normal skin and eczema biopsies. In the present study, BCL-2 and Survivin showed strong positive expression on neoplastic lymphocytes in all cases of MF regardless of their stage. We have also shown that miR-16 was significantly upregulated in advanced cases of MF compared to cases with early disease (p-value was less than 0.05). However, expression of miR-16 did not show any statistically significant correlation with age, gender, or expression of apoptotic markers. On the other hand, the expression of miR-93 showed significant downregulation in all lymphoma cases irrespective of their stage, compared to normal and eczema cases. Our results suggest that upregulation of miR-16 could be used to predict an aggressive course of the disease. We also suggest that miR-93 downregulation could serve as possible tool for establishing early diagnosis in early challenging cases. Our findings also provide consistent evidence that the anti-apoptotic molecules may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this type of cutaneous lymphomas and promote the idea that their inhibition could be an interesting novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of MF."
https://openalex.org/W2981928965,"Muscle and bone masses are elevated by the increased mechanical stress associated with body weight gain in obesity. However, the mechanisms by which obesity affects muscle and bone remain unclear. We herein investigated the roles of obesity and humoral factors from adipose tissue in the recovery phase after reloading from disuse-induced muscle wasting and bone loss using normal diet (ND)- or high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice with hindlimb unloading (HU) and subsequent reloading. Obesity did not affect decreases in trabecular bone mineral density (BMD), muscle mass in the lower leg, or grip strength in HU mice. Obesity significantly increased trabecular BMD, muscle mass in the lower leg, and grip strength in reloading mice over those in reloading mice fed ND. Among the humoral factors in epididymal and subcutaneous adipose tissue, leptin mRNA levels were significantly higher in reloading mice fed HFD than in mice fed ND. Moreover, circulating leptin levels were significantly higher in reloading mice fed HFD than in mice fed ND. Leptin mRNA levels in epididymal adipose tissue or serum leptin levels positively correlated with the increases in trabecular BMD, total muscle mass, and grip strength in reloading mice fed ND and HFD. The present study is the first to demonstrate that obesity enhances the recovery of bone and muscle masses as well as strength decreased by disuse after reloading in mice. Leptin may contribute to the recovery of muscle and bone enhanced by obesity in mice."

However, devices used for these measurements are not widely available and are costly. Currently, the use of a digital manometer is recommended. In industry, several inexpensive devices are available, but these have not been validated for clinical use. Our objective was to determine the agreement between maximal respiratory pressures obtained with a clinical digital manometer and that with a non-clinical digital manometer in healthy volunteers. We assessed the height, weight, lung function, MIP, and MEP of healthy volunteers. To compare pressures obtained by each type of digital manometer, a parallel approach configuration was used. The agreement was measured with the Intraclass Coefficient Correlation (ICC) and the Bland-Altman plot. Twenty-seven participants (14 men) were recruited with a median age of 22 (range: 21-23) years. Each participant underwent three measurements to give a total of 81 measurements. The mean MIPs were 90.8 ± 26.4 (SEM 2.9) and 91.1 ± 26.4 (SEM 2.9) cmH2O for the clinical and non-clinical digital manometers, respectively. The mean MEPs were 113.8 ± 40.4 (SEM 4.5) and 114.5 ± 40.5 (SEM 4.5) cmH2O for the clinical and non-clinical digital manometers, respectively. We obtained an ICC of 0.998 (IC 0.997-0.999) for MIP and 0.999 (IC 0.998-0.999) for MEP. There is a high agreement in the values obtained for MIP and MEP between clinical and non-clinical digital manometers in healthy volunteers. Further validation at lower pressures and safety profiling among human subjects is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2982259201,"Introduction Half of all Ugandans (49%) turn to the private or private-not-for-profit (PNFP) sectors when faced with illness, yet little is known about the capacity of these sectors to deliver surgical services. We partnered with the Ministry of Health to conduct a nationwide mixed-methods evaluation of private and PNFP surgical capacity in Uganda. Methods A standardized validated facility assessment tool was utilized to assess facility infrastructure, service delivery, workforce, information management, and financing at a randomized nationally representative sample of 16 private and PNFP hospitals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to qualitatively explore facilitating factors and barriers to surgical, obstetric and anaesthesia (SOA) care. Hospitals walk-throughs and retrospective reviews of operative logbooks were completed. Results Hospitals had a median of 177 beds and two operating rooms. Ten hospitals (62.5%) were able to perform all Bellwether procedures (cesarean section, laparotomy and open fracture treatment). Thirty-day surgical volume averaged 102 cases per facility. While most hospitals had electricity, oxygen, running water, and necessary equipment, many reported pervasive shortages of blood, surgical consumables, and anesthetic drugs. Several themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: (1) geographic distance and limited transportation options delay reaching care; (2) workforce shortages impede the delivery of surgical care; (3) emergency and obstetric volume overwhelm the surgical system; (4) medical and non-medical costs delay seeking, reaching, and receiving care; and (5) there is poor coordination of care with insufficient support systems. Conclusion As in Uganda’s public sector, barriers to surgery in private and PNFP hospitals in Uganda are cross-cutting and closely tied to resource availability. Critical policy and programmatic developments are essential to build and strengthen Ugandan surgical capacity across all sectors."
https://openalex.org/W2981350442,"Several risk scores have been created to predict long term mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Several studies demonstrated a reduction in long-term mortality following bilateral internal thoracic arteries (BITA) compared to single internal thoracic artery. However, these prediction models usually referred to long term survival as survival of up to 5 years. Moreover, none of these models were built specifically for operation incorporating BITA grafting.A historical cohort study of all patients who underwent isolated BITA grafting between 1996 and 2011 at Tel-Aviv Sourasky medical center, a tertiary referral university affiliated medical center with a 24-bed cardio-thoracic surgery department. Study population (N = 2,935) was randomly divided into 2 groups: learning group which was used to build the prediction model and validation group. Cox regression was used to predict death using pre-procedural risk factors (demographic data, patient comorbidities, cardiac characteristics and patient's status). The accuracy (discrimination and calibration) of the prediction model was evaluated.The learning (1,468 patients) and validation (1,467 patients) groups had similar preoperative characteristics and similar survival. Older age, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive lung disease, congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, old MI, ejection fraction ≤30%, pre-operative use of intra-aortic balloon, and peripheral vascular disease, were significant predictors of mortality and were used to build the prediction model. The area under the ROC curves for 5, 10, and 15-year survival ranged between 0.742 and 0.762 for the learning group and between 0.766 and 0.770 for the validation group. The prediction model showed good calibration performance in both groups. A nomogram was built in order to introduce a simple-to-use tool for prediction of 5, 10, and 15-year survival.A simple-to-use validated model can be used for a prediction of 5, 10, and 15-year mortality after CABG using the BITA grafting technique."

Studies have shown potential immunomodulatory properties of MIP, the most significant being the ability to induce strong Th1 type of response, enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, activation of APCs and lymphocytes, elicitation of M.tb specific poly-functional T cells. All of these form crucial components of host-immune response during M.tb infection. Also, MIP was found to be potent inducer of autophagy in macrophages which resulted in enhanced clearance of M.tb from MIP and M.tb co-infected cells. Hence, we further examined the component/s of MIP responsible for autophagy induction. Interestingly, we found that MIP lipids and DNA were able to induce autophagy but not the protein fraction. LAM being one of the crucial components of mycobacterial cell-wall lipids and possessing the ability of immunomodulation; we isolated LAM from MIP and did a comparative study with M.tb-LAM. Stimulation with MIP-LAM resulted in significantly high secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and displayed high autophagy inducing potential in macrophages as compared to M.tb-LAM. Treatment with MIP-LAM enhanced the co-localization of M.tb within the phago-lysosomes and increased the clearance of M.tb from the infected macrophages. This study describes LAM to be a crucial component of MIP which has significant contribution to its immunotherapeutic efficacy against TB."
https://openalex.org/W2982144352,"Chronic antibody mediated rejection (cAMR) remains a significant barrier to achieving long-term graft survival in kidney transplantation, which results from alloantibody production from B lymphocytes and plasma cells. APRIL (A proliferation-inducing ligand) and BLyS (B lymphocyte stimulator) are critical survival factors for B lymphocytes and plasma cells. Here we describe the results of APRIL/BLyS blockade in a murine cAMR kidney transplant model. c57/B6 mice underwent kidney transplantation with Bm12 kidneys (minor MHC mismatch), a well-described model for chronic rejection where animals cannot make donor specific antibody but rather make antinuclear antibody (ANA). Following transplantation, animals received TACI-Ig (to block APRIL and BLyS) or no treatment. Animals were continued on treatment until harvest 4 weeks following transplant. Serum was analyzed for circulating anti-nuclear autoantibodies using HEp-2 indirect immunofluorescence. Spleen and transplanted kidneys were analyzed via H&E. ANA production was significantly decreased in APRIL/BLyS blockade treated animals (p<0.0001). No significant difference in autoantibody production was found between syngeneic transplant control (B6 to B6) and APRIL/BLyS blockade treated animals (p = 0.90). Additionally, disruption of splenic germinal center architecture was noted in the APRIL/BLyS blockade treated animals. Despite the significant decrease in autoantibody production and germinal center disruption, no significant difference in lymphocyte infiltration was noted in the transplanted kidney. APRIL/BLyS blockade resulted in a significant decrease of autoantibody production and disrupted splenic germinal center formation in a chronic kidney transplant model, however in this model no difference in kidney transplant pathology was seen, which may have to do with the absence of any T cell centric immunosuppression. Regardless, these findings suggest that APRIL/BLyS blockade may play a role in decreasing antibody formation long-term in kidney transplantation. Future investigations will use APRIL/BLyS blockade in conjunction with T lymphocyte depleting agents to determine its efficacy in chronic rejection."
https://openalex.org/W2982238873,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the US with the majority of deaths due to metastatic disease. Current chemotherapeutic regimens involve highly toxic agents, which limits their utility; therefore, more effective and less toxic agents are required to see a reduction in CRC mortality. Novel fluorinated N,N’-diarylureas (FND) were developed and characterized by our group as potent activators of adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) that inhibit cell cycle progression. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a lead FND compound, FND-4b, either alone or combined with PI-103 (a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) or SN-38 (active metabolite of irinotecan) on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of CRC cell lines (both commercially-available and novel lines established from our patient population). Treatment with FND-4b for 24h resulted in a marked induction of phosphorylated AMPK expression and a concomitant reduction in markers of cell proliferation, such as cyclin D1, in all CRC cell lines. Apoptosis was also notably increased in CRC cells treated with FND-4b. Regardless of the genetic profile of the CRC cells, FND-4b treatment alone resulted in decreased cell proliferation. Moreover, the combination of FND-4b with PI-103 resulted in increased cell death in all cell lines, while the combination of FND-4b with SN-38 resulted in increased cell death in select cell lines. Our findings identify FND-4b, which activates AMPK at micromolar concentrations, as a novel and effective inhibitor of CRC growth either alone or in combination with PI-103 and SN-38."

Previously, we identified sCD36 as a potential non-circadian biomarker of chronic circadian disturbance in mice. The aim of the current study (n = 232 individuals) was to identify whether sCD36 measured in plasma can be used as a non-circadian marker of chronic circadian disturbance in humans, which would allow its use to measure the effects of interventions and monitoring in large-scale studies. We compared levels of plasma sCD36 of day workers with recent (< 2 years) and experienced (> 5 years) night-shift workers within the Klokwerk study. We detected no differences in sCD36 levels between day workers and recent or experienced night-shift workers, measured during a day or afternoon shift. In addition, sCD36 levels measured directly after a night shift were not different from sCD36 levels measured during day or afternoon shifts, indicating no acute effect of night shifts on sCD36 levels in our study. In summary, our study does not show a relation between night-shift work experience (recent or long-term) and plasma levels of sCD36. Since we do not know if and for which time span night-shift work is associated with changes in sCD36 levels, and our study was relatively small and cross-sectional, further evidence for an association between chronic circadian disruption and this candidate biomarker sCD36 should be gathered from large cohort studies."
https://openalex.org/W2981824573,"The current dominant visual processing paradigm in both human and machine research is the feedforward, layered hierarchy of neural-like processing elements. Within this paradigm, visual saliency is seen by many to have a specific role, namely that of early selection. Early selection is thought to enable very fast visual performance by limiting processing to only the most salient candidate portions of an image. This strategy has led to a plethora of saliency algorithms that have indeed improved processing time efficiency in machine algorithms, which in turn have strengthened the suggestion that human vision also employs a similar early selection strategy. However, at least one set of critical tests of this idea has never been performed with respect to the role of early selection in human vision. How would the best of the current saliency models perform on the stimuli used by experimentalists who first provided evidence for this visual processing paradigm? Would the algorithms really provide correct candidate sub-images to enable fast categorization on those same images? Do humans really need this early selection for their impressive performance? Here, we report on a new series of tests of these questions whose results suggest that it is quite unlikely that such an early selection process has any role in human rapid visual categorization."
https://openalex.org/W2981364880,"BACKGROUND Midkine (MDK), one of the heparin-binding growth factors, is highly expressed in multiple organs during embryogenesis. Plasma concentrations have been reported to be elevated in patients with a variety of malignancies, in adults with obesity, and in children with short stature, diabetes, and obesity. However, the concentrations in healthy children and their relationships to age, nutrition, and linear growth have not been well studied. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Plasma MDK was measured by immunoassay in 222 healthy, normal-weight children (age 0-18 yrs, 101 boys), 206 healthy adults (age 18-91 yrs, 60 males), 61 children with BMI ≥ 95th percentile (age 4-18 yrs, 20 boys), 20 girls and young women with anorexia nervosa (age 14-23 yrs), and 75 children with idiopathic short stature (age 3-18 yrs, 42 boys). Body fat was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in a subset of subjects. The associations of MDK with age, sex, adiposity, race/ethnicity and stature were evaluated. RESULTS In healthy children, plasma MDK concentrations declined with age (r = -0.54, P < 0.001) with values highest in infants. The decline occurred primarily during the first year of life. Plasma MDK did not significantly differ between males and females or between race/ethnic groups. MDK concentrations were not correlated with BMI SDS, fat mass (kg) or percent total body fat, and no difference in MDK was found between children with anorexia nervosa, healthy weight and obesity. For children with idiopathic short stature, MDK concentrations did not differ significantly from normal height subjects, or according to height SDS or IGF-1 SDS. CONCLUSIONS In healthy children, plasma MDK concentrations declined with age and were not significantly associated with sex, adiposity, or stature-for-age. These findings provide useful reference data for studies of plasma MDK in children with malignancies and other pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2981564089,"Car-borne surveys were carried out in metropolitan Tokyo, Japan, in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 to estimate the transition of absorbed dose rate in air from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. Additionally, the future transition of absorbed dose rates in air based on this five-year study and including previously reported measurements done in 2014 by the authors was analyzed because central Tokyo has large areas covered with asphalt and concrete. The average absorbed dose rate in air (range) in the whole area of Tokyo measured in 2018 was 59 ± 9 nGy h-1 (28-105 nGy h-1), and it was slightly decreased compared to the previously reported value measured in 2011 (61 nGy h-1; 30-200 nGy h-1). In the detailed dose rate distribution map, while areas of higher dose rates exceeding 70 nGy h-1 had been observed on the eastern and western ends of Tokyo after 2014, the dose rates in these areas have decreased yearly. Especially, the decreasing dose rate from radiocesium (Cs-134 + Cs-137) in the eastern end of Tokyo which is mainly covered by asphalt was higher than that measured in the western end which is mainly covered by forest. The percent reductions for the eastern end in the years 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 were 49%, 21%, 18% and 16%, and those percent reductions for western end were 26%, 18%, 6% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, the decrease for dose rate from radiocesium depended on the types of asphalt, and that on porous asphalt was larger than the decrease on standard asphalt."
https://openalex.org/W2982235337,"Aim To evaluate the safety of 1.25mg and 2mg intravitreal ziv-aflibercept (IVZ) in Ghanaian eyes with choroido-retinal vascular diseases. Design Prospective, randomised, double blind, interventional study. Methods Twenty patients with centre involving macular oedema in diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and neovascular age-related macular degeneration were assigned to 2 groups receiving 3 doses of 1.25mg/0.05ml (group 1) and 2mg/0.08ml IVZ (Group 2) at 4 weekly intervals. Safety data was collected after 30 minutes, 1 and 7 days, and 4, 8 and 12 weeks after injection. Changes in continuous variables were compared using paired t-test and categorical variables were compared using chi-square test of proportions. Repeated-Measures ANOVA with nesting test was used to compare variations in continuous variables by IVZ dose over time. Primary outcome measures were ocular and systemic adverse events at 4 weeks. Results Eleven females and nine males, with mean age of 63.2± 7.3 years were included. Ocular adverse events included subconjunctival haemorrhage in 1 eye, intraocular pressure (IOP) >21mmHg at 30 minutes in 6 eyes and mild pain in 3 eyes at 1-day. There was no significant difference in IOP rise between the 2 groups at 30 minutes (p = 0.21). No other ocular or systemic adverse events were observed. There was significant improvement in the best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR) from 0.95±0.6 to 0.6±0.4 (p<0.01) and 0.47±0.3 (p<0.01), reduction in central subfield foveal thickness from 405.9±140 um at baseline to 255.6±75 um (p<0.01) and 238±88 um (p<0.01) at 4 and 12 weeks respectively, although no difference was observed between the 2 groups (p = 0.34). Conclusion IVZ at 1.25mg and 2mg had similar safety profiles, and did not have any major unexpected adverse events. Further studies with larger cohorts are required to confirm efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2982283114,"Objective Low parity women are at increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Unfavourable lipid profiles have been found in one-child mothers years before they conceive. However, it remains unclear whether unfavourable lipid profiles are evident in these women also after their first birth. The aim was to estimate post-pregnancy lipid levels in one-child mothers compared to mothers with two or more children and to assess these lipid’s associations with number of children. Methods We used data on 32 618 parous women (4 490 one-child mothers and 28 128 women with ≥2 children) examined after first childbirth as part of Cohort of Norway (1994–2003) with linked data on reproduction and number of children from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (1967–2008). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for one lifetime pregnancy (vs. ≥2 pregnancies) by lipid quintiles were obtained by logistic regression and adjusted for age at examination, year of first birth, body mass index, oral contraceptive use, smoking and educational level. Results Compared to women with the lowest quintiles, ORs for one lifetime pregnancy for the highest quintiles of LDL and total cholesterol were 1.30 (95%CI: 1.14–1.45) and 1.43 (95%CI: 1.27–1.61), respectively. Sensitivity analysis (women <40 years) showed no appreciable change in our results. In stratified analyses, estimates were slightly stronger in overweight/obese, physically inactive and women with self-perceived bad health. Conclusions Mean lipid levels measured after childbirth in women with one child were significantly higher compared to mothers with two or more children and were associated with higher probability of having only one child. These findings corroborate an association between serum lipid levels and one lifetime pregnancy (as a feature of subfecundity), emphasizing that these particular women may be a specific predetermined risk group for cardiovascular related disease and death."
https://openalex.org/W2982117588,"The geologic history of the Southeastern United States of America is missing nearly 350-million-years of rocks, sediments, and fossils. This gap defines the Fall Line nonconformity where Upper Ordovician consolidated rocks are directly overlain by Upper Cretaceous unconsolidated sediments of the Atlantic Coastal Plain Province. Here we begin to fill in the missing geologic record by reporting the discovery of fossils of lower-to-middle Paleozoic tabulate corals (Syringophyllidae) in angular, quartz-rich, ferruginous sandstones that crop out in the Carolina Sandhills Physiographic Province that forms the updip margin of the Atlantic Coastal Plain Province near the Fall Line. These fossils of extinct tabulate corals are the first evidence that Paleozoic (Upper Ordovician–Lower Silurian) sandstones crop out amidst the mostly Mesozoic-to-Cenozoic deposits of the Atlantic Coastal Plain Province of the United States of America. This discovery of Paleozoic fossils and strata in a region in which they were previously entirely unknown offers a more complete insight into the geologic history of the Southern Appalachian Mountains Region, Carolina Sandhills and updip margin of the Atlantic Coastal Plain Province and extends the previously identified range of Syringophyllidae in North America."
