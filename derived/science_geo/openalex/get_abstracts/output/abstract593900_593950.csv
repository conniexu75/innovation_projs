However, the microstructure that increases strength tends to reduce ductility. He et al. used a processing mechanism to create a “forest” of line defects in manganese steel. This deformed and partitioned steel was produced by cold-rolling and low-temperature annealing and contained a dislocation network that improved both strength and ductility.

Here, we examine the microbiome profile of 350 stool samples collected longitudinally for more than a year from the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. The data reveal annual cyclic reconfiguration of the microbiome, in which some taxa become undetectable only to reappear in a subsequent season. Comparison of the Hadza data set with data collected from 18 populations in 16 countries with varying lifestyles reveals that gut community membership corresponds to modernization: Notably, the taxa within the Hadza that are the most seasonally volatile similarly differentiate industrialized and traditional populations. These data indicate that some dynamic lineages of microbes have decreased in prevalence and abundance in modernized populations."

We report that water permeability in 0.8-nanometer-diameter carbon nanotube porins (CNTPs), which confine water down to a single-file chain, exceeds that of biological water transporters and of wider CNT pores by an order of magnitude. Intermolecular hydrogen-bond rearrangement, required for entry into the nanotube, dominates the energy barrier and can be manipulated to enhance water transport rates. CNTPs block anion transport, even at salinities that exceed seawater levels, and their ion selectivity can be tuned to configure them into switchable ionic diodes. These properties make CNTPs a promising material for developing membrane separation technologies."

We report carbon nanotube yarn harvesters that electrochemically convert tensile or torsional mechanical energy into electrical energy without requiring an external bias voltage. Stretching coiled yarns generated 250 watts per kilogram of peak electrical power when cycled up to 30 hertz, as well as up to 41.2 joules per kilogram of electrical energy per mechanical cycle, when normalized to harvester yarn weight. These energy harvesters were used in the ocean to harvest wave energy, combined with thermally driven artificial muscles to convert temperature fluctuations to electrical energy, sewn into textiles for use as self-powered respiration sensors, and used to power a light-emitting diode and to charge a storage capacitor."
https://openalex.org/W2746181160,"In plants, the photosynthetic machinery photosystem II (PSII) consists of a core complex associated with variable numbers of light-harvesting complexes II (LHCIIs). The supercomplex, comprising a dimeric core and two strongly bound and two moderately bound LHCIIs (C2S2M2), is the dominant form in plants acclimated to limited light. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of two forms of C2S2M2 (termed stacked and unstacked) from Pisum sativum at 2.7- and 3.2-angstrom resolution, respectively. In each C2S2M2, the moderately bound LHCII assembles specifically with a peripheral antenna complex CP24-CP29 heterodimer and the strongly bound LHCII, to establish a pigment network that facilitates light harvesting at the periphery and energy transfer into the core. The high mobility of peripheral antennae, including the moderately bound LHCII and CP24, provides insights into functional regulation of plant PSII."

Thus, comprehensive and unbiased analysis of locus-specific regulatory composition provides mechanistic insight into genome structure and function in development and disease. Temporal and tissue-specific gene expression depends on cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and associated trans-acting factors. In contrast to protein-coding genes, our understanding of cis-regulatory DNA is very limited. Analyses of the human epigenome have revealed more than one million DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS), many of which act as transcriptional enhancers (Thurman et al., 2012Thurman R.E. Rynes E. Humbert R. Vierstra J. Maurano M.T. Haugen E. Sheffield N.C. Stergachis A.B. Wang H. Vernot B. et al.The accessible chromatin landscape of the human genome.Nature. 2012; 489: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar); however, the regulatory composition of the vast majority of these elements remain unknown, largely due to the limitations of the technologies previously employed to study CREs. Cis-regulatory DNA is bound and interpreted by protein and RNA complexes and is organized as a 3D structure through long-range chromatin interactions. Identifying the complete composition of a specific CRE in situ can provide unprecedented insight into the mechanisms regulating its activity. However, purifying a small chromatin segment from the cellular milieu represents a major challenge—the protein complexes isolated with the targeted chromatin constitute only a small fraction of the co-purified proteins, most of which are non-specific associations. As such, major challenges have limited the application of existing approaches in purifying a specific genomic locus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have provided crucial insights into the genome-wide distribution of TFs and histone marks, but it relies on a priori identification of molecular targets and is confined to examining single TFs. Targeted purification of genomic loci with engineered binding sites has been employed to identify single locus-associated proteins, yet it requires knockin gene targeting, which remains inefficient. DNA sequence-specific molecules such as locked nucleic acids (LNAs) (Déjardin and Kingston, 2009Déjardin J. Kingston R.E. Purification of proteins associated with specific genomic loci.Cell. 2009; 136: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and transcription activator-like (TAL) proteins (Fujita et al., 2013Fujita T. Asano Y. Ohtsuka J. Takada Y. Saito K. Ohki R. Fujii H. Identification of telomere-associated molecules by engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP).Sci. Rep. 2013; 3: 3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have been used to enrich large chromatin structures, but these approaches do not enrich for a single genomic locus and cannot be adapted for multiplexed applications. The development of the CRISPR system containing an inactive Cas9 nuclease facilitated sequence-specific enrichment of native genomic regions (Fujita and Fujii, 2013Fujita T. Fujii H.

A CRISPR-based approach for proteomic analysis of a single genomic locus.Epigenetics. 2014; 9: 1207-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); however, these studies were limited to antibody-based purification, whereas the genome-scale specificity and the utility in identifying the cis- and trans-regulatory components were not evaluated. Here, we developed an approach to isolate CRE-regulating proteins and long-range DNA interactions by repurposing the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Using human telomeres, β-globin cluster, and embryonic stem cell (ESC) super-enhancers (SEs), we identified trans-acting proteins at a single genomic locus. By combining dCas9 capture with chromatin interaction assays, we revealed locus-specific DNA interactions critical for regulatory function. In situ capture of SE constituents and disease-associated cis-elements provides insight into composition-based hierarchical regulation. Hence, the unbiased analysis of CRE-regulating proteome and 3D interactome by in situ capture has the potential to uncover the causal relationship between organizational structure and transcriptional function in a mammalian genome. To facilitate the analysis of native CREs, we developed a method to isolate chromatin interactions in situ (Figure 1A). The core components of CRISPR include Cas9 and a single guide RNA (sgRNA), which serves to direct Cas9 to a target genomic sequence (Cong et al., 2013Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S. Barretto R. Habib N. Hsu P.D. Wu X. Jiang W. Marraffini L.A. Zhang F.

DiCarlo J.E. Norville J.E. Church G.M. RNA-guided human genome engineering via Cas9.Science. 2013; 339: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (6424) Google Scholar). We engineered an N-terminal FLAG and biotin-acceptor-site (FB)-tagged deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) (Figure 1B). Upon in vivo biotinylation of dCas9 by the biotin ligase BirA together with sequence-specific sgRNAs in mammalian cells, the genomic locus-associated macromolecules are isolated by high-affinity streptavidin purification. The purified protein, RNA, and DNA complexes are identified and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics and high-throughput sequencing for study of native CRE-regulating proteins, RNA, and long-range DNA interactions, respectively (Figure 1A). This approach has several advantages:(1)High sensitivity—the affinity between biotin and streptavidin with Kd = 10−14 mol/L is >1,000-fold higher than antibody-mediated interactions (Kim et al., 2009aKim J. Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H. Wang J. Use of in vivo biotinylation to study protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 506-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, Schatz, 1993Schatz P.J. Use of peptide libraries to map the substrate specificity of a peptide-modifying enzyme: a 13 residue consensus peptide specifies biotinylation in Escherichia coli.Nat Biotechnol. 1993; 11: 1138-1143Crossref Scopus (508) Google Scholar), thus allowing for more efficient and stable capture of protein-DNA complexes.(2)High specificity—this approach avoids using antibodies, which significantly reduces non-specific binding. In addition, the extraordinary stability of biotin-streptavidin allows for stringent purification to eliminate protein contamination.(3)Adaptability for multiplexed approaches—the dCas9/sgRNA system can be manipulated by altering sgRNA sequences or combinations, thus allowing for medium- to high-throughput analysis of chromatin interactions. Taken together, this new approach, which we named CAPTURE (CRISPR affinity purification in situ of regulatory elements), has the potential to expedite the analysis of chromatin-templated events by characterizing the entire set of interacting macromolecules and how composition changes during cellular differentiation. As a proof-of-principle, we used CAPTURE to isolate human telomeres in K562 cells (Figure 1C). We employed a validated telomere-targeting sgRNA (sgTelomere; Figure 1C) (Chen et al., 2013Chen B. Gilbert L.A. Cimini B.A. Schnitzbauer J. Zhang W. Li G.W. Park J. Blackburn E.H. Weissman J.S. Qi L.S. Huang B.

Upon stable co-expression of sgTelomere and biotinylated dCas9, we observed significant enrichment of telomeric DNA (Figure 1E). The known telomere-associated protein TERF2 was highly enriched in sgTelomere-expressing samples but not in control samples expressing dCas9 alone (no sgRNA) or the non-targeting sgGal4 (Figure 1F). Most importantly, by iTRAQ-based proteomics, we identified many known telomere maintenance proteins (Déjardin and Kingston, 2009Déjardin J. Kingston R.E.

To validate the CAPTURE approach for identifying single copy CREs, we focused on the human β-globin cluster containing five β-like globin genes controlled by a shared enhancer cluster (locus control region [LCR]) with five discrete DHS (HS1–HS5). We designed two or three independent sgRNAs for each promoter (HBG1, HBG2, and HBB), enhancer (HS1–HS4), or insulator (HS5) (Tables S1 and S2). Upon co-expression of sgRNAs and dCas9, K562 chromatin was cross-linked and purified, followed by sequencing of the captured DNA (CAPTURE-ChIP-seq; Figure 2A). We observed specific and significant enrichment of discrete sgRNA-targeted regions (Figure 2B). For example, expression of two sgRNAs for HS1 (sgHS1-sg1 and sg2) led to significant enrichment of HS1 but no other enhancers. Because of the sequence similarity between HBG1 and HBG2, the sgRNAs targeting HBG promoters (sgHBG-sg1 and sg2) do not distinguish the two genes. Consistently, co-expression of sgHBG and dCas9 resulted in significant enrichment of both HBG genes. In contrast, binding of dCas9 to β-globin cluster was undetectable when expressed alone (no sgRNA) or with the non-targeting sgGal4. Importantly, co-expression of five sgRNAs (sgHS1–5) led to simultaneous capture of all five LCR enhancers, demonstrating that the CAPTURE system can be adapted for multiplexed analysis of independent CREs. Furthermore, by comparing ChIP-seq intensity using two or three independent sgRNAs, we observed highly specific enrichment of each captured region with minimal off targets (Figures 2C and S1D). Given the consistent performance, hereafter we focus on one sgRNA (sg1; Table S2) for each region unless otherwise specified.Figure S1Genome-wide Enrichment and Specificity of dCas9-Mediated CAPTURE, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) CAPTURE-ChIP-seq markedly improved the on-target enrichment compared to antibody-based ChIP-seq.

To identify locus-specific interactions, it is critical to evaluate the on-target enrichment and off-target effects. We first compared CAPTURE-ChIP-seq with dCas9 or FLAG antibody-based ChIP-seq using sgHS2 and sgHBG, and we observed significantly higher binding intensity by CAPTURE-ChIP-seq (Figure S1A; Table S1). Among the top 100 peaks by sgHS2, CAPTURE-ChIP-seq led to 18- or 284-fold on-target enrichment compared to dCas9 or FLAG-based ChIP-seq, respectively (Figure S1B). At the global scale, CAPTURE-ChIP-seq resulted in highly specific enrichment of HS2 or HBG with many fewer off targets than antibody-based ChIP-seq (Figure S1C). These results provide evidence that the CAPTURE approach allows for more efficient purification of targeted chromatin through improved on-target enrichment and elimination of potential off targets. We next assessed the genome-wide specificity by comparing dCas9 binding in cells expressing target-specific sgRNAs or sgGal4. Specifically, recruitment of dCas9 by sgHS2 resulted in highly specific enrichment of HS2 with no additional significant dCas9 binding (Figure 2D). Similarly, recruitment of dCas9 by sgHBG led to specific enrichment of HBG1 and HBG2, whereas none of the predicted off targets were significantly enriched (Figure 2E). Moreover, multiplexed capture by sgHS1–5 resulted in identification of LCR enhancers as the top enriched binding sites (Figure 2F). Similar results were obtained with 12 other sgRNAs (Figures S1D and S1E; Table S1). RNA-seq in target-specific sgRNAs, sgGal4, and wild-type (WT) K562 cells revealed minimal transcriptomic changes (Figures 2G and S1F). The expression of β-globin mRNAs remained unchanged (Figure S1G), suggesting that the dCas9 capture did not interfere with the expression of endogenous genes. Together, these analyses establish that the CAPTURE system is highly specific to target loci and can be used to isolate locus-specific regulatory components. A major challenge for proteomic analysis of a single genomic locus is the need for a sufficient amount of purified proteins. Hence, we optimized several components of the procedures including protein purification, peptide isolation, and quantitative proteomic profiling, and we developed the “CAPTURE-Proteomics” approach to identify locus-specific protein complexes (Figures 3A and S2A). We first performed purification in control cell lines to categorize the endogenous biotinylated proteins and/or dCas9-associated non-specific proteins (Figure S2B). Specifically, we identified proteins purified from K562 cells expressing BirA only, BirA with dCas9, BirA with dCas9 and sgGal4, and BirA with dCas9 and β-globin CRE-specific sgRNAs in which the endogenous β-globin cluster was deleted (BirA-dCas9-sgAll-Globin-KO; Method Details). Compiled from three experiments, we identified 304–468 proteins from individual controls, including 277 “high-confidence non-specific proteins” present in all controls (Figure S2B; Table S4).Figure S2CAPTURE-Proteomics Identify CRE-Associated Protein Complexes at the β-Globin Cluster, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Schematic of iTRAQ-based CAPTURE-Proteomics.

We then performed iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics of captured β-globin CREs (Figure 3C). Relative protein abundance associated with the captured CRE versus sgGal4 was determined by the ratio of the iTRAQ reporter ion intensity. The significance of enrichment (P value) for each protein was calculated by t test of the log2 iTRAQ ratios in replicate experiments. We surveyed the distribution of high-confidence non-specific proteins in all experiments and observed that 78.3% and 79.8% of them had iTRAQ ratio < 1.5 and P value > 0.05 (Figure S2C). Therefore, we employed the iTRAQ ratio ≥ 1.5 and P value ≤ 0.05 as the cutoffs and identified 25–164 candidate locus-specific proteins (Figures 3D, S2D, and S2E; Table S4). Using CAPTURE-Proteomics, we identified many known factors including GATA1, TAL1, NFE2, components of the SWI/SNF (ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARCA4, and SMARCC1), and NuRD (CHD4, RBBP4, RBBP7, HDAC1, and HDAC2) complexes (Kim et al., 2009bKim S.I.

Our study reveals that BAF-mediated changes in chromosome mechanics underlie nuclear assembly with broad implications for proper genome function. Nearly all eukaryotic cells store their genome in a single nuclear compartment. The genome itself, however, is divided into numerous chromosomes. If individual chromosomes form a separate nucleus (micronucleus), they are prone to DNA damage or even complete chromosome pulverization by chromothripsis (Crasta et al., 2012Crasta K. Ganem N.J. Dagher R. Lantermann A.B. Ivanova E.V. Pan Y. Nezi L. Protopopov A. Chowdhury D. Pellman D.

Micronuclei are a common feature of cancer cells and thought to be a major driver in the evolution of cancer genomes (Leibowitz et al., 2015Leibowitz M.L. Zhang C.-Z. Pellman D. Chromothripsis: a new mechanism for rapid karyotype evolution.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2015; 49: 183-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The packaging of all chromosomes into a single nucleus is therefore critical for the maintenance of genome integrity and health. Cells of higher eukaryotes disassemble their nucleus during mitosis to form individualized chromosomes that move independently on the mitotic spindle (Cuylen et al., 2016Cuylen S. Blaukopf C. Politi A.Z. Müller-Reichert T. Neumann B. Poser I. Ellenberg J. Hyman A.A. Gerlich D.W. Ki-67 acts as a biological surfactant to disperse mitotic chromosomes.Nature. 2016; 535: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). If individual chromosomes attach incorrectly to the mitotic spindle, they can lag behind the mass of segregating anaphase chromosomes and then often package into a separate micronucleus during mitotic exit (Crasta et al., 2012Crasta K. Ganem N.J. Dagher R. Lantermann A.B. Ivanova E.V. Pan Y. Nezi L. Protopopov A. Chowdhury D. Pellman D. DNA breaks and chromosome pulverization from errors in mitosis.Nature. 2012; 482: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Thus, individual chromosomes can, in principle, function as a template for nuclear reformation. Yet, in normally segregating cells, each set of anaphase chromosomes consistently packages into a single nucleus. During interphase of the cell cycle, various transmembrane proteins link the nuclear envelope (NE) to chromatin either by direct binding to DNA or by binding to adaptor proteins like barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) (Ungricht and Kutay, 2017Ungricht R. Kutay U. Mechanisms and functions of nuclear envelope remodelling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 229-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, Wandke and Kutay, 2013Wandke C. Kutay U. Enclosing chromatin: reassembly of the nucleus after open mitosis.Cell. 2013; 152: 1222-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Upon mitotic entry, these linkages are disrupted by protein phosphorylation. Consequently, transmembrane proteins of the NE disperse in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while other NE proteins dissolve into the cytoplasm (Wandke and Kutay, 2013Wandke C. Kutay U. Enclosing chromatin: reassembly of the nucleus after open mitosis.Cell. 2013; 152: 1222-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). During mitotic exit, dephosphorylation of these proteins promotes rebinding of ER-derived membranes to chromatin (Wandke and Kutay, 2013Wandke C. Kutay U. Enclosing chromatin: reassembly of the nucleus after open mitosis.Cell. 2013; 152: 1222-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). How nuclear membranes are guided along the surface of a chromosome set to form a single nucleus, rather than enwrapping individual chromosomes remains unknown. Membrane-chromatin interactions might be limited by the spindle-mediated compaction of chromosomes. The chromokinesin Kid localizes along microtubules within the anaphase chromosome ensemble and Kid knock-out mice display micronucleation during early development (Ohsugi et al., 2008Ohsugi M. Adachi K. Horai R. Kakuta S. Sudo K. Kotaki H. Tokai-Nishizumi N. Sagara H. Iwakura Y. Yamamoto T. Kid-mediated chromosome compaction ensures proper nuclear envelope formation.Cell. 2008; 132: 771-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the Kid knock-out did not perturb nuclear assembly in cells of adult mice (Ohsugi et al., 2008Ohsugi M. Adachi K. Horai R. Kakuta S. Sudo K. Kotaki H. Tokai-Nishizumi N. Sagara H. Iwakura Y. Yamamoto T. Kid-mediated chromosome compaction ensures proper nuclear envelope formation.Cell. 2008; 132: 771-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of alternative mechanisms that restrict nuclear membranes to the surface of the chromosome ensemble. The formation of a single nuclear surface might also be explained by a limited amount of membranes that can associate with chromatin (Webster et al., 2009Webster M. Witkin K.L. Cohen-Fix O. Sizing up the nucleus: nuclear shape, size and nuclear-envelope assembly.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1477-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). While this is a conceivable hypothesis, experimental support has yet to be corroborated. To gain insights into the morphogenesis of the nucleus, we manipulated microtubules and chromosome geometries in human cells. This revealed that neither the mitotic spindle nor limiting amounts of membranes explain the formation of a single nuclear surface. By image-based screening, we identified BAF as a key factor driving formation of a single nucleus in a spindle-independent manner. Our investigations in cells and in vitro suggest that BAF shapes a single nucleus through the formation of a dense chromatin network that limits membranes to the surface of the chromosome ensemble. The mitotic spindle might specify a single nuclear surface by bringing anaphase chromosomes into proximity. To test whether the spindle is required to form a single nucleus, we assayed nuclear assembly in human cells with depolymerized microtubules. We visualized chromosomes and the NE in HeLa cells by stably co-expressing a core histone H2B tagged with mCherry (H2B-mCherry) and the nuclear membrane protein Lap2β tagged with EGFP (Lap2β-EGFP). We then imaged live cells that were either untreated or treated with both nocodazole, to depolymerize microtubules (Figures S1A and S1B), and reversine, to suppress the spindle assembly checkpoint (Santaguida et al., 2010Santaguida S. Tighe A. D’Alise A.M. Taylor S.S. Musacchio A. Dissecting the role of MPS1 in chromosome biorientation and the spindle checkpoint through the small molecule inhibitor reversine.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This combination drug treatment enables spindle-less cells to progress to mitotic exit. Drug-treated cells entering mitosis disassembled the NE and released individualized mitotic chromosomes into the cytoplasm, similar to untreated control cells (Figure 1A). The large majority of drug-treated cells subsequently packaged their non-segregated chromosomes into a single nucleus (88.3% ± 3.6%, mean ± SD) (Figures 1A–1C; Movie S1). The mitotic spindle is thus not required to shape a single nucleus from a set of individualized mitotic chromosomes.Figure 1A Spindle-Independent Mechanism Shapes a Single Nucleus from a Set of Individualized Mitotic ChromosomesShow full caption(A) Live HeLa cells were imaged in the absence or presence of nocodazole and reversine.

See also Figure S1 and Movies S1 and S2. The formation of a single nucleus might be due to limiting amounts of NE membranes (Webster et al., 2009Webster M. Witkin K.L. Cohen-Fix O. Sizing up the nucleus: nuclear shape, size and nuclear-envelope assembly.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1477-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To test this, we exposed ectopic chromatin surfaces by separating chromosomes via Taxol-induced microtubule asters (Figure S1C). Cells progressing through mitosis in the presence of Taxol and reversine formed many micronuclei during mitotic exit (Figures 1D–1F; Movie S2). Almost all micronuclei were fully enwrapped by nuclear membrane (Figure 1D) and enriched for the nuclear transport substrate IBB-EGFP (importin-β-binding domain of importin-α [Görlich et al., 1996Görlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. A 41 amino acid motif in importin-alpha confers binding to importin-beta and hence transit into the nucleus.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar] [Figure S1D]), indicating a sealed NE. Only very few cells contained some compact structures (Figure S1E) consistent with spontaneous micronucleus collapse (Hatch et al., 2013Hatch E.M. Fischer A.H. Deerinck T.J. Hetzer M.W. Catastrophic nuclear envelope collapse in cancer cell micronuclei.Cell. 2013; 154: 47-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus, spindle-independent assembly of a single nucleus cannot be explained by a limiting amount of nuclear membranes. We hypothesized that shaping a single nucleus from an ensemble of individualized mitotic chromosomes might require spindle-independent factors. To identify proteins whose depletion causes micronucleation after spindle-less mitosis, we used small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to target 1,295 candidate genes, including all factors previously identified as important for mitosis by genome-wide screening (Hériché et al., 2014Hériché J.-K.

Liebel U. et al.Phenotypic profiling of the human genome by time-lapse microscopy reveals cell division genes.Nature. 2010; 464: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) and the candidate nuclear assembly factor Kid (Ohsugi et al., 2008Ohsugi M. Adachi K. Horai R. Kakuta S. Sudo K. Kotaki H. Tokai-Nishizumi N. Sagara H. Iwakura Y. Yamamoto T. Kid-mediated chromosome compaction ensures proper nuclear envelope formation.Cell. 2008; 132: 771-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). HeLa cells expressing H2B-mCherry were subjected to RNAi-mediated depletion of the target proteins, followed by treatment with nocodazole and reversine for the duration of one cell cycle. We then imaged live cells and automatically quantified the incidence of micronucleation by supervised machine learning (Figure 2A) (Held et al., 2010Held M. Schmitz M.H.A. Fischer B. Walter T. Neumann B. Olma M.H. Peter M. Ellenberg J. Gerlich D.W. CellCognition: time-resolved phenotype annotation in high-throughput live cell imaging.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The most penetrant micronucleation phenotype was caused by an siRNA targeting BAF (Figures 2B and 2C; Table S1). BAF is an evolutionarily conserved protein that is ubiquitously expressed and essential for cell viability (Blomen et al., 2015Blomen V.A. Májek P. Jae L.T. Bigenzahn J.W. Nieuwenhuis J. Staring J.

Cell Biol. 2015; 34: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Further, BAF depletion was previously shown to cause nuclear morphology defects (Furukawa et al., 2003Furukawa K. Sugiyama S. Osouda S. Goto H. Inagaki M. Horigome T. Omata S. McConnell M. Fisher P.A. Nishida Y.

Segura-Totten M. Gruenbaum Y. Wilson K.L. Barrier-to-autointegration factor is required to segregate and enclose chromosomes within the nuclear envelope and assemble the nuclear lamina.Proc. Natl.

Thus, we considered BAF a strong candidate for a generic factor shaping single nuclei from sets of mitotic chromosomes. To verify the role of BAF in forming a single nucleus, we first tested whether BAF deficiency induces nuclear fragmentation in cells with intact spindles. Indeed, BAF depletion caused a strong nuclear fragmentation phenotype (Figures 2D and 2E), which was observed with several siRNAs and specific to on-target binding on the BAF mRNA (Figures S2A–S2I). We further observed nuclear fragmentation upon BAF depletion in non-cancer, diploid hTERT-RPE1 cells (Figures S2J and S2K). To characterize nuclear morphology phenotypes in more detail, we stained DNA, lamin B, and kinetochores and performed 3D super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Graphical reconstructions of nuclear surfaces showed strong lobulation and the presence of micronuclei in 39% ± 11% of BAF-depleted cells (Figures 2F and 2G). Most micronuclei contained a single kinetochore (Figure 2H), validating that BAF depletion induces micronucleus formation around individual chromosomes. To test whether micronuclei in BAF-depleted cells were fully disconnected from primary nuclei, we investigated the localization of nucleoplasmic proteins. Live-cell imaging of the small nuclear import substrate IBB-EGFP showed that nuclei of BAF-depleted cells had lower concentrations of IBB-EGFP than control cells (Figures 2I and 2J), consistent with prior findings that BAF depletion perturbs sealing of the NE (Gorjánácz et al., 2007Gorjánácz M. Klerkx E.P.F. Galy V. Santarella R. López-Iglesias C. Askjaer P. Mattaj I.W.

Segura-Totten M. Gruenbaum Y. Wilson K.L. Barrier-to-autointegration factor is required to segregate and enclose chromosomes within the nuclear envelope and assemble the nuclear lamina.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 3290-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Importantly, neighboring nuclear fragments in BAF-depleted cells often had variable concentrations of IBB-EGFP (Figures 2I and 2K), indicating that their nucleoplasm was not connected. Thus, BAF is a key factor for shaping a single nucleus from mitotic chromosomes in the presence or absence of mitotic spindles. Micronuclei in BAF-depleted cells might arise from chromosome segregation errors. However, BAF depletion did not increase the incidence of lagging chromosomes and anaphase chromosome bridges (Figures S3A and S3B). BAF has been implicated in various non-mitotic processes, including the regulation of gene expression and DNA repair (Jamin and Wiebe, 2015Jamin A. Wiebe M.S. Barrier to Autointegration Factor (BANF1): interwoven roles in nuclear structure, genome integrity, innate immunity, stress responses and progeria.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2015; 34: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We hence tested whether BAF’s contribution to nuclear assembly is provided during mitosis. We developed an approach for inducible, acute depletion of BAF from the cytosol, utilizing the chemically-inducible dimerization of FKBP (FK506 binding protein 12) and FRB (a fragment of mTOR) (Rivera et al., 1996Rivera V.M. Clackson T. Natesan S. Pollock R. Amara J.F. Keenan T. Magari S.R. Phillips T. Courage N.L. Cerasoli Jr., F. et al.A humanized system for pharmacologic control of gene expression.Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) to relocalize BAF to the plasma membrane upon rapamycin treatment (Figure S3C). To achieve this, we stably expressed RNAi-resistant BAF fused to FKBP (BAF-EGFP-FKBP) together with a chimeric protein containing FRB and a plasma membrane targeting domain (Hammond et al., 2012Hammond G.R.V. Fischer M.J. Anderson K.E. Holdich J. Koteci A. Balla T. Irvine R.F. PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 are essential but independent lipid determinants of membrane identity.Science. 2012; 337: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In the absence of rapamycin, depletion of endogenous BAF did not cause nuclear fragmentation in these cells (Figure S3D), showing that the siRNA-resistant BAF-EGFP-FKBP transgene is functional. Addition of rapamycin to metaphase cells efficiently depleted the cytoplasmic pool of BAF-EGFP-FKBP by re-localization to the plasma membrane, and cells formed fragmented nuclei as they progressed through mitotic exit (Figure S3D). Therefore, BAF shapes a single nucleus through a function specifically provided during the late stages of mitosis. BAF’s requirement for nuclear assembly has been attributed to a function in recruiting NE proteins to anaphase chromosomes through its binding to DNA as well as to several inner NE proteins containing a LEM (Lap2/Emerin/Man1) domain (Haraguchi et al., 2001Haraguchi T. Koujin T. Segura-Totten M. Lee K.K. Matsuoka Y. Yoneda Y. Wilson K.L. Hiraoka Y. BAF is required for emerin assembly into the reforming nuclear envelope.J.

LAP2 binds to BAF.DNA complexes: requirement for the LEM domain and modulation by variable regions.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, to what extent the nuclear morphology defects in BAF-depleted cells arise from impaired recruitment of LEM-domain proteins is not clear. We therefore investigated BAF’s role in recruiting the inner nuclear membrane LEM-domain protein Lap2β-EGFP to anaphase chromosomes. In control cells, Lap2β-EGFP accumulated on anaphase chromosomes within the first 10 min after anaphase onset (Figures 3A–3D; Movie S3). BAF-depleted cells enriched Lap2β-EGFP on chromosomes almost as efficiently as control cells during early anaphase, but unexpectedly further accumulated Lap2β-marked membranes (Figures 3A–3D; Movie S3). The excess membranes in BAF-depleted cells predominantly accumulated at inter-chromosomal regions (Figures 3A–3E; Movie S3), leading to lobular nuclear protrusions (Figures 3F–3H) and subsequently micronuclei (Figure S3E). Thus, BAF is not required for efficient recruitment of a canonical LEM-protein to anaphase chromatin. Instead, BAF prevents entry of nuclear membranes into the mass of anaphase chromosomes. Ectopic nuclear membrane binding in BAF-depleted cells might be due to a perturbed arrangement of chromosomes. Geometric measurements, however, showed that BAF-depleted cells had chromosome ensemble geometries that were indistinguishable from controls at the time point of initial NE rebinding (Figures S4A–S4E), indicating proper chromosome segregation and compaction. The disorganized nuclear membranes in BAF-depleted cells might result from perturbed disassembly of anaphase spindle microtubules. Immunostaining of microtubules, however, showed that BAF-depleted anaphase cells cleared microtubules from the chromosome ensemble as efficiently as control cells (Figures S4F–S4H). Moreover, BAF depletion did not affect the efficacy of nocodazole-induced microtubule depolymerization (Figure S4I) and time-lapse microscopy of nocodazole/reversine-treated cells showed that BAF depletion induced substantial penetration of nuclear membranes into the mass of chromosomes (Figures S4J and S4K). Thus, micronucleation in BAF-depleted cells is not due to perturbed microtubule organization. Overall, these data show that BAF stabilizes the compact arrangement of anaphase chromosomes to restrict nuclear membranes to the surface. BAF’s previously described function as a recruitment factor for LEM-domain proteins (Haraguchi et al., 2001Haraguchi T. Koujin T. Segura-Totten M. Lee K.K. Matsuoka Y. Yoneda Y. Wilson K.L.

We therefore considered alternative mechanisms for BAF’s role in nuclear assembly. BAF was initially discovered as a protein that binds to viral DNA in the host cell cytoplasm. This is exploited by some retroviruses to prevent destructive autointegration into their genome (Lee and Craigie, 1998Lee M.S. Craigie R. A previously unidentified host protein protects retroviral DNA from autointegration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Suppression of viral autointegration has been proposed to result from DNA compaction (Lee and Craigie, 1998Lee M.S. Craigie R.

USA. 2009; 106: 16610-16615Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the ability of BAF dimers to bridge distant DNA segments, which we refer to as DNA cross-bridging, might be relevant for nuclear assembly. To dissect the distinct functions of BAF, we designed a mutation at a key hydrophobic residue, BAFL58R, that is predicted to interfere with LEM-domain binding, but not with BAF dimerization and DNA binding (Figure 4A). We compared this mutant to a previously published dimerization-deficient mutant, BAFG47E (Umland et al., 2000Umland T.C. Wei S.Q. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Structural basis of DNA bridging by barrier-to-autointegration factor.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9130-9138Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which cannot cross-bridge distant DNA segments (Figure 4A). To test if the BAFL58R mutation efficiently abrogated LEM-domain binding, we established an in vitro assay using DNA-coated beads and fluorescently labeled purified recombinant proteins (Figure 4B). We found that BAFL58R bound to DNA-coated beads as efficiently as wild-type BAF (Figures 4C and 4D). However, unlike wild-type BAF, BAFL58R did not recruit the recombinant LEM domain (Figures 4C and 4E). The dimerization-deficient mutant BAFG47E bound to DNA-coated beads less efficiently than wild-type BAF (Figures 4C and 4D), which is likely due to the monomeric protein’s loss of avidity. BAFG47E did not recruit recombinant LEM domain (Figure 4E) as expected, because the LEM-binding site spans the BAF dimer interface (Cai et al., 2007Cai M. Huang Y. Suh J.-Y. Louis J.M. Ghirlando R.

Hence, the L58R and G47E mutations both efficiently suppress BAF’s binding to LEM-domains in vitro. We next used these BAF mutants to test which of the two functions—LEM-domain binding or dimerization—is required for nuclear assembly in human cells. We generated HeLa and hTERT-RPE1 cell lines stably expressing the different siRNA-resistant human BAF variants, depleted endogenous BAF by RNAi, and quantified"
https://openalex.org/W2750371861,"INTRODUCTION When an egg is fertilized by a sperm, the chromosomes of the mother and the father become united, and a genetically unique embryo starts to form. A healthy embryo can only develop if both the egg and the sperm contain precisely one copy of each chromosome. However, human eggs frequently contain an incorrect number of chromosomes. Fertilization of these aneuploid eggs is a leading cause of miscarriages, infertility, and Down syndrome. Most aneuploidy results from chromosome segregation errors during the meiotic divisions of the egg. Chromosome segregation is well established to be driven by a spindle that consists of microtubules. The microtubules first capture and align the chromosomes at the spindle center. During anaphase, the spindle segregates the chromosomes and moves them to the spindle poles. The movement of chromosomes is driven by the shortening of microtubule bundles that are attached to the chromosomes’ kinetochores, called kinetochore fibers (K-fibers). Although actin has been reported in spindles of various species, it is generally not thought to be involved in chromosome segregation. RATIONALE We found prominent actin filaments in spindles of human, mouse, porcine, and ovine eggs. The filaments permeated the entire spindle volume and formed structures that resembled a microtubule spindle. The wide conservation of spindle actin suggested that it has an essential function, which we set out to investigate. We visualized spindle actin organization in mouse eggs using superresolution imaging of fluorescently labeled actin, microtubules, and chromosomes in living and fixed cells. We then investigated the function of spindle actin by either depleting actin from the spindle or increasing the amount of actin in the spindle. To deplete spindle actin, we used eggs that lacked formin-2, the actin nucleation factor that is required to form spindle actin, and treated eggs with an actin-depolymerizing drug. To increase spindle actin, we targeted a protein domain to the spindle that stabilizes actin filaments. We then imaged chromosomes and the spindle at high spatial and temporal resolution throughout the first and second meiotic division and quantified defects. We also investigated potential defects in spindle organization, including the dynamics of microtubules in the spindle and the formation and bundling of K-fibers, using a combination of quantitative assays in live and fixed eggs. RESULTS Spindle actin assembled gradually during the first meiotic division in mouse oocytes and became most prominent when the chromosomes segregated during anaphase: Dense, long actin bundles that spanned the entire spindle length permeated the microtubule spindle throughout anaphase. Unexpectedly, we found that eggs that lacked actin were more likely to suffer from chromosome segregation errors during both the first and second meiotic division. Actin-depleted eggs took longer to align their chromosomes and frequently contained chromosomes that were trapped at the spindle poles or oscillated within the spindle. Also, the acute addition of actin-disrupting drugs to spindles in which the chromosomes had already been aligned led to displacement of chromosomes from the spindle center. When chromosomes were segregated during anaphase, individual chromosomes were frequently lagging behind the main masses of chromosomes, and the overall speed of chromosome movement was reduced. Actin is likely to facilitate chromosome alignment and segregation by promoting the formation of K-fibers because K-fibers were reduced when spindle actin was absent. Consistent with this model, increasing the amount of actin in the spindle led to an increase in K-fibers as well as defects in chromosome alignment and segregation. CONCLUSION That actin drives the formation of K-fibers was unexpected because K-fibers are generally thought to be formed by microtubule-associated proteins and kinetochore components independently of actin. Our data therefore highlight a previously unknown mechanism of how K-fibers are generated in mammalian eggs. Mammalian eggs are highly prone to chromosome segregation errors, which are a leading cause of miscarriages and genetic disorders such as Down syndrome. Understanding the mechanisms that drive chromosome segregation in mammalian eggs is therefore particularly important. The presence of spindle actin in other mammalian eggs, including humans, hints at a conserved function in chromosome segregation. This function may even extend beyond mammals because actin filaments have been reported in spindles of a variety of species and cell types."

Listeners extract pitch movements from speech and evaluate the shape of intonation contours independent of each speaker's pitch range. We used high-density electrocorticography to record neural population activity directly from the brain surface while participants listened to sentences that varied in intonational pitch contour, phonetic content, and speaker. Cortical activity at single electrodes over the human superior temporal gyrus selectively represented intonation contours. These electrodes were intermixed with, yet functionally distinct from, sites that encoded different information about phonetic features or speaker identity. Furthermore, the representation of intonation contours directly reflected the encoding of speaker-normalized relative pitch but not absolute pitch."
https://openalex.org/W2745605347,"It is often argued that female researchers publish on average less than male researchers do, but male and female authored papers have an equal impact. In this paper we try to better understand this phenomenon by (i) comparing the share of male and female researchers within different productivity classes, and (ii) by comparing productivity whereas controlling for a series of relevant covariates. The study is based on a disambiguated Swedish author dataset, consisting of 47,000 researchers and their WoS-publications during the period of 2008-2011 with citations until 2015. As the analysis shows, in order to have impact quantity does make a difference for male and female researchers alike—but women are vastly underrepresented in the group of most productive researchers. We discuss and test several possible explanations of this finding, using a data on personal characteristics from several Swedish universities. Gender differences in age, authorship position, and academic rank do explain quite a part of the productivity differences."

These granulomas are usually cutaneous, reflecting the ∼30°C growth optimum of M. leprae, similar to that of the human skin (∼34°C) (Bierman, 1936Bierman W. The temperature of the skin surface.J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1936; 106: 1158-1162Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Renault and Ernst, 2015Renault C.A. Ernst J.D. Mycobacterium leprae (Leprosy).in: Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Blaser M.J.

Viable M. leprae as a research reagent.Int. J. Lepr. Other Mycobact. Dis. 2001; 69: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). M. leprae is the only mycobacterial infection that causes widespread demyelinating neuropathy, which results in the main morbidities of leprosy, including autoamputation of digits and blindness (Renault and Ernst, 2015Renault C.A. Ernst J.D. Mycobacterium leprae (Leprosy).in: Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Blaser M.J. Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett’s Infectious Disease Essentials. Elsevier, 2015: 2819-2831Google Scholar). Understanding the pathogenesis of leprosy neuropathy has been stymied by the inability to culture M. leprae, which has undergone severe reductive evolution of its genome to become an obligate intracellular pathogen (Cole et al., 2001Cole S.T. Eiglmeier K. Parkhill J. James K.D. Thomson N.R. Wheeler P.R. Honoré N. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. et al.Massive gene decay in the leprosy bacillus.Nature. 2001; 409: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar, Scollard et al., 2006Scollard D.M. Adams L.B. Gillis T.P. Krahenbuhl J.L. Truman R.W. Williams D.L. The continuing challenges of leprosy.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 19: 338-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The lack of genetic tools for studying M. leprae is compounded by the lack of genetically tractable animal models that mimic the human disease. The athymic mouse footpad is used to grow M. leprae for research purposes, but mice do not manifest neurological disease (Scollard et al., 2006Scollard D.M. Adams L.B. Gillis T.P. Krahenbuhl J.L. Truman R.W. Williams D.L. The continuing challenges of leprosy.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 19: 338-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). While the nine-banded armadillo develops neuropathy following infection with M. leprae, it suffers from a paucity of molecular and genetic tools (Truman et al., 2014Truman R.W. Ebenezer G.J. Pena M.T. Sharma R. Balamayooran G. Gillingwater T.H. Scollard D.M. McArthur J.C. Rambukkana A. The armadillo as a model for peripheral neuropathy in leprosy.ILAR J. 2014; 54: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consequently, our understanding of the pathogenesis of leprosy neuropathy in vivo largely comes from studies of patients; however, the 4- to 10-year delay in the onset of symptoms largely precludes studies of the early events that lead to neuropathy (Noordeen, 1994Noordeen S. The epidemiology of leprosy.in: Hastings R.C. Leprosy. Churchhill Livingstone, 1994: 29-48Google Scholar). Leprosy can present as a clinical spectrum; at the poles of this spectrum are paucibacillary (or tuberculoid) and multibacillary (or lepromatous) disease. The former is characterized by a vigorous immune response, while the latter, an ineffective one (Scollard et al., 2006Scollard D.M. Adams L.B. Gillis T.P. Krahenbuhl J.L. Truman R.W. Williams D.L. The continuing challenges of leprosy.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 19: 338-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Neuropathy features prominently in both forms of the disease. Hence, bacterial determinants and host immune responses likely play roles in leprosy neuropathy, although the relative importance and mechanisms by which each contributes to nerve injury are poorly understood. In vitro studies suggest a model wherein M. leprae directly causes demyelination by infecting and dedifferentiating the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves (Rambukkana et al., 2002Rambukkana A. Zanazzi G. Tapinos N. Salzer J.L. Contact-dependent demyelination by Mycobacterium leprae in the absence of immune cells.Science. 2002; 296: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, Truman et al., 2014Truman R.W. Ebenezer G.J. Pena M.T. Sharma R. Balamayooran G. Gillingwater T.H. Scollard D.M. McArthur J.C. Rambukkana A. The armadillo as a model for peripheral neuropathy in leprosy.ILAR J. 2014; 54: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These studies identified an M. leprae outer membrane lipid, phenolic glycolipid 1 (PGL-1), that is critical for binding to laminin α2, an interaction thought to promote infection of the Schwann cells (Ng et al., 2000Ng V. Zanazzi G. Timpl R. Talts J.F. Salzer J.L. Brennan P.J. Rambukkana A. Role of the cell wall phenolic glycolipid-1 in the peripheral nerve predilection of Mycobacterium leprae.Cell. 2000; 103: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, this model fails to explain the neuropathy in paucibacillary leprosy, in which bacteria are seldom observed within nerve lesions (Shetty and Antia, 1996Shetty V.P. Antia N.H. A semi quantitative analysis of bacterial load in different cell types in leprous nerves using transmission electron microscope.Indian J. Lepr. 1996; 68: 105-108PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, a pathogenic CD4 T cell response, possibly acting through secreted cytokines, is implicated in paucibacillary disease (Renault and Ernst, 2015Renault C.A. Ernst J.D. Mycobacterium leprae (Leprosy).in: Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Blaser M.J. Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett’s Infectious Disease Essentials. Elsevier, 2015: 2819-2831Google Scholar). Further, the specific contributions of macrophages in leprosy neuropathy are unknown, although they are commonly infected and almost universally present in affected nerves (Job, 1973Job C.K. Mechanism of nerve destruction in tuberculoid-borderline leprosy. An electron-microscopic study.J. Neurol. Sci. 1973; 20: 25-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, Shetty and Antia, 1996Shetty V.P. Antia N.H. A semi quantitative analysis of bacterial load in different cell types in leprous nerves using transmission electron microscope.Indian J. Lepr. 1996; 68: 105-108PubMed Google Scholar). The developing zebrafish is an effective model for studying mycobacterial pathogenesis using M. marinum, a close genetic relative of the M. tuberculosis complex and the agent of fish tuberculosis (Ramakrishnan, 2004Ramakrishnan L. Using Mycobacterium marinum and its hosts to study tuberculosis.Curr. Sci. 2004; 86: 82-92Google Scholar). The genetic tractability of the zebrafish, coupled with the optical transparency of its larva, allows host-bacterium interactions to be monitored in real-time, providing critical insights into disease pathogenesis (Ramakrishnan, 2004Ramakrishnan L. Using Mycobacterium marinum and its hosts to study tuberculosis.Curr. Sci. 2004; 86: 82-92Google Scholar). Furthermore, adaptive immunity is not yet present at the larval developmental stage, permitting study of host-pathogen interactions in the sole context of innate immunity (Davis et al., 2002Davis J.M. Clay H. Lewis J.L. Ghori N. Herbomel P. Ramakrishnan L. Real-time visualization of mycobacterium-macrophage interactions leading to initiation of granuloma formation in zebrafish embryos.Immunity. 2002; 17: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Here, we exploit the optical transparency of larval zebrafish to directly visualize the earliest interactions of M. leprae with macrophages (Davis et al., 2002Davis J.M. Clay H. Lewis J.L. Ghori N. Herbomel P. Ramakrishnan L. Real-time visualization of mycobacterium-macrophage interactions leading to initiation of granuloma formation in zebrafish embryos.Immunity. 2002; 17: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and the initial events in nerve injury (Czopka, 2016Czopka T. Insights into mechanisms of central nervous system myelination using zebrafish.Glia. 2016; 64: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We use M. marinum as a comparator for these studies because, like M. leprae, it grows at ∼30°C and produces cutaneous granulomatous infections in humans (Ramakrishnan, 2004Ramakrishnan L. Using Mycobacterium marinum and its hosts to study tuberculosis.Curr. Sci. 2004; 86: 82-92Google Scholar). However, it does not cause neuropathy. Our studies reveal that M. leprae interacts with macrophages and incites granulomas similar to M. marinum (Madigan et al., 2017Madigan C.A. Cameron J. Ramakrishnan L. A zebrafish model for Mycobacterium leprae granulomatous infection.J Infect Dis. jix329. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/127639Crossref Google Scholar), but is unique in its ability to produce demyelination and axonal damage. We show that the innate macrophage response to PGL-1 triggers demyelination in vivo, even before bacilli have detectably infected the glia. Finally, we determine the mechanism of nerve damage using M. leprae and M. marinum engineered to synthesize PGL-1. To determine if zebrafish larvae might be a useful model for studying early M. leprae infection, we first examined the earliest interactions of M. leprae with phagocytes, by injecting bacteria into the caudal vein or the hindbrain ventricle (Figure 1A), where phagocytes are rarely observed in the absence of infection (Davis et al., 2002Davis J.M. Clay H. Lewis J.L. Ghori N. Herbomel P. Ramakrishnan L. Real-time visualization of mycobacterium-macrophage interactions leading to initiation of granuloma formation in zebrafish embryos.Immunity. 2002; 17: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Aggregates of infected macrophages formed within 4 days (Figure 1B), similar to the case with M. marinum infection (Davis et al., 2002Davis J.M. Clay H. Lewis J.L. Ghori N. Herbomel P. Ramakrishnan L. Real-time visualization of mycobacterium-macrophage interactions leading to initiation of granuloma formation in zebrafish embryos.Immunity. 2002; 17: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Prior studies indicate that phagocyte recruitment to M. marinum infection is unique in two respects: (1) neutrophils are not recruited to the initial site of infection (Yang et al., 2012Yang C.-T. Cambier C.J. Davis J.M. Hall C.J. Crosier P.S. Ramakrishnan L. Neutrophils exert protection in the early tuberculous granuloma by oxidative killing of mycobacteria phagocytosed from infected macrophages.Cell Host Microbe. 2012; 12: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and (2) macrophage recruitment is independent of TLR-signaling, but dependent on the monocyte chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 (Cambier et al., 2014Cambier C.J. Takaki K.K. Larson R.P. Hernandez R.E. Tobin D.M. Urdahl K.B. Cosma C.L. Ramakrishnan L. Mycobacteria manipulate macrophage recruitment through coordinated use of membrane lipids.Nature. 2014; 505: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). M. leprae shared both of these features with M. marinum: neutrophils were not recruited, whereas macrophages were (Figures 1C and 1D). Further, this recruitment was TLR/MyD88 independent and CCL2/CCR2 dependent (Figure 1D) (Cambier et al., 2014Cambier C.J. Takaki K.K. Larson R.P. Hernandez R.E. Tobin D.M. Urdahl K.B. Cosma C.L. Ramakrishnan L. Mycobacteria manipulate macrophage recruitment through coordinated use of membrane lipids.Nature. 2014; 505: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The M. marinum phenolic glycolipid (PGL-mar) induces CCL2 expression and mediates CCL2/CCR2-dependent macrophage recruitment (Cambier et al., 2014Cambier C.J. Takaki K.K. Larson R.P. Hernandez R.E. Tobin D.M. Urdahl K.B. Cosma C.L. Ramakrishnan L. Mycobacteria manipulate macrophage recruitment through coordinated use of membrane lipids.Nature. 2014; 505: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, Cambier et al., 2017Cambier C.J. O’Leary S.M. O’Sullivan M.P. Keane J. Ramakrishnan L. Phenolic glycolipid facilitates mycobacterial escape from microbicidal tissue-resident macrophages.Immunity. 2017; 47https://doi.org/10.1101/147421Crossref Google Scholar), suggesting that PGL-1 may play a similar role in M. leprae infection. Macrophages play a dichotomous role in controlling M. marinum infection: they restrict bacterial numbers, while promoting dissemination of bacteria from the infection site into deeper tissues (Clay et al., 2007Clay H. Davis J.M. Beery D. Huttenlocher A. Lyons S.E. Ramakrishnan L. Dichotomous role of the macrophage in early Mycobacterium marinum infection of the zebrafish.Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Similar to the case observed for M. marinum, M. leprae-infected animals depleted of macrophages using the pu.1 morpholino (Clay et al., 2007Clay H. Davis J.M. Beery D. Huttenlocher A. Lyons S.E. Ramakrishnan L. Dichotomous role of the macrophage in early Mycobacterium marinum infection of the zebrafish.Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) displayed higher bacterial burdens (Figures 1E and 1F). The increased bacterial burden in the pu.1 morphants is likely due to the lack of bacterial killing, rather than bacterial replication. The doubling time of M. leprae is approximately 12 days (Levy and Ji, 2006Levy L. Ji B. The mouse foot-pad technique for cultivation of Mycobacterium leprae.Lepr. Rev. 2006; 77: 5-24PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, most bacteria would not have replicated in the larvae during the 2-day infection. In addition, we assessed the role of macrophages in M. leprae dissemination, by infecting animals with fluorescent vascular endothelial cells (kdrl:dsRed). By 2 days post-infection (dpi) (4 dpf), M. leprae escaped the vasculature and entered peripheral tissues in the majority of wild-type, but not macrophage-depleted, larvae (Figures 1G and 1H). Furthermore, in wild-type animals, M. leprae resided in macrophages (apparent by Nomarski imaging in Figure S1), suggesting these cells carried M. leprae from the circulation into tissues. This is reminiscent of zebrafish infected with M. marinum, in which infected macrophages disseminate bacteria from the initial infection site into the body (Clay et al., 2007Clay H. Davis J.M. Beery D. Huttenlocher A. Lyons S.E. Ramakrishnan L. Dichotomous role of the macrophage in early Mycobacterium marinum infection of the zebrafish.Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In sum, M. leprae displays interactions with macrophages, from initial recruitment through granuloma formation, that resemble those seen for M. marinum. The presence of M. leprae-infected macrophages in the circulation of larvae mirrors findings in human leprosy (Drutz et al., 1972Drutz D.J. Chen T.S.N. Lu W.-H. The continuous bacteremia of lepromatous leprosy.N. Engl. J. Med. 1972; 287: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We next investigated the interactions of M. leprae with cells of the zebrafish nervous system, to determine if infection produced demyelination. Transgenic mbp (myelin basic protein) larvae express membrane-localized GFP that labels the myelinating membrane of glia in both the peripheral nervous system (Schwann cells) and central nervous system (oligodendrocytes) (Jung et al., 2010Jung S.-H. Kim S. Chung A.-Y. Kim H.-T. So J.-H. Ryu J. Park H.-C. Kim C.-H. Visualization of myelination in GFP-transgenic zebrafish.Dev. Dyn. 2010; 239: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Oligodendrocytes express all Schwann cell determinants that have been reported to interact with M. leprae (Table S1), and myelin structure is similar in the central and peripheral nervous systems (Morell and Quarles, 1999Morell P. Quarles R.H. Characteristic composition of myelin.in: Siegel G.J. Agranoff B.W. Albers R.W. Fisher S.K. Uhler M.D. Basic Neurochemistry: Molecular, Cellular and Medical Aspects. Lippincott-Raven, 1999: 56-67Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied M. leprae interactions with nerves in the spinal cord rather than peripheral nerves because of their easier accessibility. We injected fluorescent M. leprae into the dorsal spinal cord of larvae at 2–4 days post-fertilization (dpf), and imaged nerves at 4–8 dpf, a developmental stage at which these tracts have become myelinated (Czopka, 2016Czopka T. Insights into mechanisms of central nervous system myelination using zebrafish.Glia. 2016; 64: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Figures 2A and 2B ). At 2 dpi (4 dpf), we observed cellular protrusions from an otherwise intact myelin sheath, clustered around M. leprae in the nerve (Figure 2C). M. marinum injected into the dorsal spinal cord did not alter the myelinating membrane structure, even though the M. marinum burdens at the injection sites were higher than those in M. leprae infections (Figures 2C–2E). The M. leprae-induced myelin protrusions increased in size and number with time but always remained next to the bacteria (Figure 2F). Three-dimensional rendering showed that protrusions were doughnut shaped, not spherical, suggesting that these structures were not cell bodies but rather protrusions of myelinating membrane (Figure 2G; Movie S1). In vitro studies suggest that M. leprae interacts with glial determinants through a surface-localized long chain lipid, known as PGL-1 (m/z 2,043.75), which carries a unique trisaccharide (Ng et al., 2000Ng V. Zanazzi G. Timpl R. Talts J.F. Salzer J.L. Brennan P.J. Rambukkana A.

The phenolic glycolipid of M. marinum contains a monosaccharide and shorter lipid chains that renders it detectable at a lower mass value (m/z 1,567.44) (Figures 3A and S2B). We wondered if the trisaccharide that is normally found on M. leprae PGL-1 would be sufficient to render M. marinum capable of altering myelin. We transformed M. marinum with the six M. leprae genes responsible for assembly of PGL-1’s terminal disaccharide (Tabouret et al., 2010Tabouret G. Astarie-Dequeker C. Demangel C. Malaga W. Constant P. Ray A. Honoré N. Bello N.F. Perez E. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Mycobacterium leprae phenolglycolipid-1 expressed by engineered M. bovis BCG modulates early interaction with human phagocytes.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001159Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ion chromatograms (Figures 3A and 3B ) and collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry (Figure S2) of total lipid from the transformant, M. marinum:PGL-1, proved that it produced triglycosylated PGL-1. PGL-1 expression conferred on M. marinum the ability to cause myelin protrusions, indistinguishable from those of M. leprae in both morphology and their invariable co-localization with the bacteria (Figures 3C–3E).Figure 3Phenolic Glycolipid 1 Triggers Myelin DissociationShow full caption(A) Normal phase high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry measured at the known mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) for triglycosylated and monoglycosylated forms of PGL, leading to the separate detection of PGL-mar (m/z 1,567.44, upper structure) and PGL-1 (m/z 1,903.58, lower structure) in total lipid extracts of the indicated strains (B).(B) Chromatograms of the ions depicted in (A), showing the increased retention time of PGL-1 from M. marinum:PGL-1 (Mm:PGL1) compared to that of PGL-mar from WT M. marinum.(C) Representative confocal images, like in Figure 2C, of 2 dpi (4 dpf) larvae infected with ∼200 CFU M. marinum or M. marinum:PGL-1; myelin protrusions are quantified in (D).

Arrow, intact myelin sheath; arrowheads, myelin protrusions. Relative time code. Scale bar, 10 μm. See also Figures S2 and S3 and Movie S2. The protrusions, like those produced by M. leprae, did not colocalize with a histone marker that labels cell nuclei. This suggested they did not simply represent an accumulation of oligodendrocyte cell bodies, but rather were composed of myelinating membrane (Figure 3F). Using time-lapse imaging to observe the formation of protrusions in real time, we observed that an intact myelin sheath near the M. marinum:PGL-1 injection site began to condense and then bulge (Figure 3G). Protrusions formed by 10 hr post-infection and expanded over time (Figure 3G). To further test if myelin protrusions represent recruitment or proliferation of oligodendrocyte cell bodies, we generated larvae with a single GFP-labeled oligodendrocyte. Time-lapse movies of these larvae showed that individual oligodendrocytes form myelin protrusions by retracting portions of myelinating membrane from previously intact sheaths (Movie S2A). This occurred after injection with M. marinum:PGL-1, but not with PBS (compare Movies S2A and S2B). These findings strongly suggested that the protrusions arise from previously intact myelin sheaths, consistent with early demyelination. Similar to human leprosy (de Freitas and Said, 2013de Freitas M.R.G. Said G. Leprous neuropathy.in: Gérard S. Christian K. Handbook of Clinical Neurology. Elsevier, 2013: 499-514Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), myelin dissociation occurred in discrete areas, with the surrounding myelin sheaths remaining intact (Figures S3A–S3D). Demyelination can be imaged in detail by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We compared TEM images of transverse sections through areas of myelin protrusions at 2 days after infection to identical sections through the injection site of PBS-injected fish (Figures 4A–4C). TEMs from animals injected with M. leprae or M. marinum:PGL-1 revealed a selective decrease in myelinated axons, while the total number of axons was preserved (Figures 4D, 4E, S3E, and S3F). Higher-magnification images revealed apparently intact axons surrounded by disorganized myelin, with large spaces in between the individual lamellae (Figure S3G); this myelin decompaction is characteristic of early demyelination in human leprosy (Figure 4F) (Job, 1973Job C.K.

The condensed, fragmented myelin, which was no longer associated with axons, was observed scattered throughout the extracellular space (Figures 4A–4C and S3G). In vitro studies have focused on M. leprae-induced demyelination as a mechanism of nerve injury (Rambukkana et al., 2002Rambukkana A. Zanazzi G. Tapinos N. Salzer J.L.

The biology of nerve injury in leprosy.Lepr. Rev. 2008; 79: 242-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the peripheral neuropathy of human leprosy involves both myelinated and nonmyelinated axons (Medeiros et al., 2016Medeiros R.C.A. Girardi K.D. Cardoso F.K.L. Mietto B.S. Pinto T.G.T. Gomez L.S. Rodrigues L.S. Gandini M. Amaral J.J. Antunes S.L.G. et al.Subversion of Schwann cell glucose metabolism by Mycobacterium leprae.J. Biol.

To test if nonmyelinated axons were also affected in zebrafish, we selected an area of the spinal cord containing only one myelinated axon surrounded by many nonmyelinated axons. We observed swelling of nonmyelinated axons, as evidenced by their increased area compared to PBS-injected control (Figures 4G and 4H). Thus, M. leprae and M. marinum:PGL-1 rapidly induce damage to both myelinated and nonmyelinated axons in the zebrafish, similar to the pathological changes found in human leprosy.

https://openalex.org/W2745844264,"Germinal centers (GCs) are the primary sites of clonal B cell expansion and affinity maturation, directing the production of high-affinity antibodies. This response is a central driver of pathogenesis in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the natural history of autoreactive GCs remains unclear. Here, we present a novel mouse model where the presence of a single autoreactive B cell clone drives the TLR7-dependent activation, expansion, and differentiation of other autoreactive B cells in spontaneous GCs. Once tolerance was broken for one self-antigen, autoreactive GCs generated B cells targeting other self-antigens. GCs became independent of the initial clone and evolved toward dominance of individual clonal lineages, indicating affinity maturation. This process produced serum autoantibodies to a breadth of self-antigens, leading to antibody deposition in the kidneys. Our data provide insight into the maturation of the self-reactive B cell response, contextualizing the epitope spreading observed in autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2750428665,"C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) is an important component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. We demonstrated the induction of ER stress in response to tunicamycin stimulation, as evidenced by increased expression of chaperone proteins Grp78, Grp94, and enhanced eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit 1 (eIF2α) phosphorylation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress resulted in apoptosis and autophagy simultaneously. While inhibition of autophagy mediated by 3-methyladenine pretreatment or direct knockdown of LC3B promoted cell apoptosis, activation of autophagy with rapamycin decreased tunicamycin- induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Furthermore, CHOP was shown to be significantly upregulated upon treatment with tunicamycin in HCC cells. Specific knockdown of CHOP not only enhanced tunicamycin-induced autophagy, but also significantly attenuated ER stress-induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Accordingly, simultaneous inhibition of autophagy in HCC cells with CHOP-knockdown could partially resensitize ER stress-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our data indicate that CHOP may favor ER stress-induced apoptosis in HCC cells via inhibition of autophagy in vitro."

The lack of clinical leadership is alarming given the detrimental effects on patient safety. The objective of the study was to assess whether a leadership training addressing transactional and transformational leadership enhances leadership skills in residents.A volunteer sample of 57 residents from postgraduate year one to four was recruited across a range of medical specialties. The residents took part in an interventional controlled trial. The four-week IMPACT leadership training provided specific strategies for leadership in the clinical environment, addressing transactional (e.g. active control, contingent reward) and transformational leadership skills (e.g. appreciation, inspirational motivation). Transactional and transformational leadership skill performance was rated (1) on the Performance Scale by an external evaluator blinded to the study design and (2) self-assessed transformational and transactional leadership skills. Both measures contained items of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, with higher scores indicating greater leadership skills.Both scores were significantly different between the IMPACT group and the control group. In the IMPACT group, the Performance Scale increased 15% in transactional leadership skill performance (2.10 to 2.86) (intervention effect, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.13; p < .001, eta2 = 0.31) and 14% in transformational leadership skill performance (2.26 to 2.94) (intervention effect, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.27 to 1.09; p < .001, eta2 = 0.22). The self-assessed transactional skills revealed a 4% increase (3.83 to 4.03) (intervention effect, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.33; p < .001, eta2 = 0.18) and a 6% increase in transformational leadership skills (3.54 to 3.86) (intervention effect, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.40; p< .001, eta2 = 0.53).These findings support the use of the transactional and transformational leadership framework for graduate leadership training. Future studies should incorporate time-latent post-tests, evaluating the stability of the behavioral performance increase."

https://openalex.org/W2747156487,"Zinc deficiency and chronic low level exposures to inorganic arsenic in drinking water are both significant public health concerns that affect millions of people including pregnant women. These two conditions can co-exist in the human population but little is known about their interaction, and in particular, whether zinc deficiency sensitizes individuals to arsenic exposure and toxicity, especially during critical windows of development. To address this, we utilized the Danio rerio (zebrafish) model to test the hypothesis that parental zinc deficiency sensitizes the developing embryo to low-concentration arsenic toxicity, leading to altered developmental outcomes. Adult zebrafish were fed defined zinc deficient and zinc adequate diets and were spawned resulting in zinc adequate and zinc deficient embryos. The embryos were treated with environmentally relevant concentrations of 0, 50, and 500 ppb arsenic. Arsenic exposure significantly reduced the amount of zinc in the developing embryo by ~7%. The combination of zinc deficiency and low-level arsenic exposures did not sensitize the developing embryo to increased developmental malformations or mortality. The combination did cause a 40% decline in physical activity of the embryos, and this decline was significantly greater than what was observed with zinc deficiency or arsenic exposure alone. Significant changes in RNA expression of genes that regulate zinc homeostasis, response to oxidative stress and insulin production (including zip1, znt7, nrf2, ogg1, pax4, and insa) were found in zinc deficient, or zinc deficiency and arsenic exposed embryos. Overall, the data suggests that the combination of zinc deficiency and arsenic exposure has harmful effects on the developing embryo and may increase the risk for developing chronic diseases like diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2749579660,"Background Existing surgical innovation frameworks suffer from a unifying limitation, their qualitative nature. A rigorous approach to measuring surgical innovation is needed that extends beyond detecting simply publication, citation, and patent counts and instead uncovers an implementation-based value from the structure of the entire adoption cascades produced over time by diffusion processes. Based on the principles of evidence-based medicine and existing surgical regulatory frameworks, the surgical innovation funnel is described. This illustrates the different stages through which innovation in surgery typically progresses. The aim is to propose a novel and quantitative network-based framework that will permit modeling and visualizing innovation diffusion cascades in surgery and measuring virality and value of innovations. Materials and methods Network analysis of constructed citation networks of all articles concerned with robotic surgery (n = 13,240, Scopus®) was performed (1974–2014). The virality of each cascade was measured as was innovation value (measured by the innovation index) derived from the evidence-based stage occupied by the corresponding seed article in the surgical innovation funnel. The network-based surgical innovation metrics were also validated against real world big data (National Inpatient Sample–NIS®). Results Rankings of surgical innovation across specialties by cascade size and structural virality (structural depth and width) were found to correlate closely with the ranking by innovation value (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient = 0.758 (p = 0.01), 0.782 (p = 0.008), 0.624 (p = 0.05), respectively) which in turn matches the ranking based on real world big data from the NIS® (Spearman’s coefficient = 0.673;p = 0.033). Conclusion Network analysis offers unique new opportunities for understanding, modeling and measuring surgical innovation, and ultimately for assessing and comparing generative value between different specialties. The novel surgical innovation metrics developed may prove valuable especially in guiding policy makers, funding bodies, surgeons, and healthcare providers in the current climate of competing national priorities for investment."

We thus evaluated the numbers of EV in plasma over 28 days after trauma and evaluated their pro-coagulant and inflammatory effects.37 patients suffering trauma with an injury severity score >15 were studied along with 24 healthy controls. Plasma samples were isolated by double centrifugation (2000g 20min; 13000g 2min) from blood collected from within an hour up to 28 days after injury. Plasma EV were counted and sized using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA); counts and cellular origins were also determined by flow cytometry (FC) using cell-specific markers. Functional effects were tested in a procoagulant phospholipid assay and in flow-based, leukocyte adhesion assay after endothelial cells (EC) were treated with EV. We found that EV concentrations measured by NTA were significantly increased in trauma patients compared to healthy controls, and remained elevated over days. In addition, or FC showed that patients with trauma had higher numbers of EV derived from platelets (CD41+), leukocytes (CD45+) and endothelial EC (CD144+). The increases were evident throughout the 28-day follow-up. However, the FC count represented <1% of the count detected by NTA, and only 1-2% of EV identified using NTA had a diameter >400nm. The procoagulant phospholipid activity assay showed that patient plasma accelerated coagulation on day 1 and day 3 after trauma, with coagulation times correlated with EV counts. Furthermore, treatment of EC for 24 hours with plasma containing EV tended to increase the recruitment of peripheral flowing blood mononuclear cells.EV counted by FC represent a small sub-population of the total load detected by NTA. Both methods however indicate a significant increase in plasma EV after severe traumatic injury that have pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory effects that may influence outcomes."

For the first four weeks, the patients were treated with the combination of sulphasalazine, methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine and low dose prednisolone (FIN-RACo DMARD combination), and subsequently randomized to receive placebo or infliximab added on the treatment for further 22 weeks. Disease activity was evaluated using the 28-joint disease activity score and plasma YKL-40 concentrations were measured by immunoassay.At the baseline, plasma YKL-40 concentration was 57 ± 37 (mean ± SD) ng/ml. YKL-40 was significantly associated with the disease activity score, interleukin-6 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate both at the baseline and during the 26 weeks' treatment. The csDMARD combination decreased YKL-40 levels already during the first four weeks of treatment, and there was no further reduction when the tumour necrosis factor-α antagonist infliximab was added on the combination treatment.High YKL-40 levels were found to be associated with disease activity in early DMARD-naïve RA and during intensive treat-to-target therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2750502400,"While a subgroup of patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) clearly benefit from antibiotics, their identification remains challenging. We hypothesised that selective assessment of the balance between the two dominant bacterial groups (Gammaproteobacteria (G) and Firmicutes (F)) in COPD sputum samples might reveal a subgroup with a bacterial community structure change at exacerbation that was restored to baseline on recovery and potentially reflects effective antibiotic treatment.Phylogenetically specific 16S rRNA genes were determined by quantitative real time PCR to derive a G:F ratio in serial sputum samples from 66 extensively-phenotyped COPD exacerbation episodes.Cluster analysis based on Euclidean distance measures, generated across the 4 visit times (stable and exacerbation day: 0,14 and 42) for the 66 exacerbation episodes, revealed three subgroups designated HG, HF, and GF reflecting predominance or equivalence of the two target bacterial groups. While the other subgroups showed no change at exacerbation, the HG cluster (n = 20) was characterized by G:F ratios that increased significantly at exacerbation and returned to baseline on recovery (p<0.00001); ratios in the HG group also correlated positively with inflammatory markers and negatively with FEV1. At exacerbation G:F showed a significant receiver-operator-characteristic curve to identify the HG subgroup (AUC 0.90, p<0.0001).The G:F ratio at exacerbation can be determined on a timescale compatible with decisions regarding clinical management. We propose that the G:F ratio has potential for use as a biomarker enabling selective use of antibiotics in COPD exacerbations and hence warrants further clinical evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2749658895,"The aim of this study is to determine inter-laboratory variability on embryo assessment using time-lapse platform and conventional morphological assessment. This study compares the data obtained from a pilot study of external quality control (EQC) of time lapse, performed in 2014, with the classical EQC of the Spanish Society for the Study of Reproductive Biology (ASEBIR) performed in 2013 and 2014. In total, 24 laboratories (8 using EmbryoScope™, 15 using Primo Vision™ and one with both platforms) took part in the pilot study. The clinics that used EmbryoScope™ analysed 31 embryos and those using Primo Vision™ analysed 35. The classical EQC was implemented by 39 clinics, based on an analysis of 25 embryos per year. Both groups were required to evaluate various qualitative morphological variables (cell fragmentation, the presence of vacuoles, blastomere asymmetry and multinucleation), to classify the embryos in accordance with ASEBIR criteria and to stipulate the clinical decision taken. In the EQC time-lapse pilot study, the groups were asked to determine, as well as the above characteristics, the embryo development times, the number, opposition and size of pronuclei, the direct division of 1 into 3 cells and/or of 3 into 5 cells and false divisions. The degree of agreement was determined by calculating the intra-class correlation coefficients and the coefficient of variation for the quantitative variables and the Gwet index for the qualitative variables. For both EmbryoScope™ and Primo Vision™, two periods of greater inter-laboratory variability were observed in the times of embryo development events. One peak of variability was recorded among the laboratories addressing the first embryo events (extrusion of the second polar body and the appearance of pronuclei); the second peak took place between the times corresponding to the 8-cell and morula stages. In most of the qualitative variables analysed regarding embryo development, there was almost-perfect inter-laboratory agreement among conventional morphological assessment (CMA), EmbryoScope™ and Primo Vision™, except for false divisions, vacuoles and asymmetry (users of all methods) and multinucleation (users of Primo Vision™), where the degree of agreement was lower. The inter-laboratory agreement on embryo classification according to the ASEBIR criteria was moderate-substantial (Gwet 0.41–0.80) for the laboratories using CMA and EmbryoScope™, and fair-moderate (Gwet 0.21–0.60) for those using Primo Vision™. The inter-laboratory agreement for clinical decision was moderate (Gwet 0.41–0.60) on day 5 for CMA users and almost perfect (Gwet 0.81–1) for time-lapse users. In conclusion, time-lapse technology does not improve inter-laboratory agreement on embryo classification or the analysis of each morphological variable. Moreover, depending on the time-lapse platform used, inter-laboratory agreement may be lower than that obtained by CMA. However, inter-laboratory agreement on clinical decisions is improved with the use of time lapse, regardless of the platform used."

Neonicotinoids are persistent in the environment and transport analyses are helpful estimate leaching potential from soils that could result in groundwater pollution. The objective of this study was to analyze IMD breakthrough under saturated water flow in soil columns packed with three horizons (A, E, Bh) of Immokalee Fine Sand (IFS). Also, we used the dimensionless form of the convective-dispersive model (CD-Model) to compare the optimized transport parameters from each column experiment (retardation factor, R; fraction of instantaneous-to-total retardation, β; and mass transfer coefficient, ω) with the parameters obtained from sorption batch equilibria and sorption kinetics. The tracer (Cl-) breakthrough curves (BTCs) were symmetrical and properly described by the CD-Model. IMD BTCs from A, Bh, and multilayered [A+E+Bh] soil columns showed steep fronts and tailing that were well described by the one-site nonequilibrium (OSNE) model, which was an evidence of non-ideal transport due to IMD mass transfer into the soil organic matter. In general, IMD was weakly-sorbed in the A and Bh horizons (R values of 3.72 ± 0.04 and 3.08 ± 0.07, respectively), and almost no retardation was observed in the E horizon (R = 1.20 ± 0.02) due to its low organic matter content (0.3%). Using the HYDRUS-1D package, optimized parameters (R, β, ω) from the individual columns successfully simulated IMD transport in a multilayered column mimicking an IFS soil profile. These column studies and corresponding simulations agreed with previous findings from batch sorption equilibria and kinetics experiments, where IMD showed one-site kinetic mass transfer between soil surfaces and soil solution. Ideally, sandy soils should be maintained unsaturated by crop irrigation systems and rainfall monitoring during and after soil-drench application. The unsaturated soil will increase IMD retardation factors and residence time for plant uptake, lowering leaching potential from soil layers with low sorption capacity, such as the E horizon."

This study optimised parameters such as excess media concentration and warming rates and used the findings to enable the successful cryopreservation of 2.3 litres of alginate encapsulated liver cell spheroids. This volume of biomass is typical of those required for successful treatment of Acute Liver Failure using our Bioartificial Liver Device. Adding a buffer of medium above the biomass, as well as slow (0.6°C/min) warming rates was found to give the best results, so long as the warming through the equilibrium melting temperature was rapid. After 72 h post thaw-culture, viable cell number, glucose consumption, lactate production, and alpha-fetoprotein production had recovered to pre-freeze values in the 2.3 litre biomass (1.00 ± 0.05, 1.19 ± 0.10, 1.23 ± 0.18, 2.03 ± 0.04 per ml biomass of the pre-cryopreservation values respectively). It was also shown that further improvements in warming rates of the biomass could reduce recovery time to < 48 h. This is the first example of a biomass of this volume being successfully cryopreserved in a single cassette and re-cultured. It demonstrates that a bioartificial liver device can be cryopreserved, and has wider applications to scale-up large volume cryopreservation."

Considering the low permeability of the blood-brain barrier, we wondered if a reduced selective pressure by neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in the central nervous system (CNS) could favor the evolution of NAb-sensitive viruses in this compartment. Single genome amplification (SGA) was used to sequence full-length HIV-1 envelope variants (453 sequences) from paired CSF and blood plasma samples in 9 subjects infected by HIV variants of various clades and suffering from diverse neurologic disorders. Dynamics of viral evolution were evaluated with a bayesian coalescent approach for individuals with longitudinal samples. Pseudotyped viruses expressing envelope glycoproteins variants representative of the quasi-species present in each compartment were generated, and their sensitivity to autologous neutralization, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and entry inhibitors was assessed. Significant compartmentalization of HIV populations between blood and CSF were detected in 5 out of 9 subjects. Some of the previously described genetic determinants for compartmentalization in the CNS were observed regardless of the HIV-1 clade. There was no difference of sensitivity to autologous neutralization between blood- and CSF-variants, even for subjects with compartmentalization, suggesting that selective pressure by autologous NAb is not the main driver of HIV evolution in the CNS. However, we observed major differences of sensitivity to sCD4 or to at least one bNAb targeting either the N160-V1V2 site, the N332-V3 site or the CD4bs, between blood- and CSF-variants in all cases. In particular, HIV-1 variants present in the CSF were more resistant to bNAbs than their blood counterpart in some cases. Considering the possible migration from CSF to blood, the CNS could be a reservoir of bNAb resistant viruses, an observation that should be considered for immunotherapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2748395910,"Objective India has the second largest diabetic population in the world. The chronic nature of the disease and high prevalence of co-existing chronic medical conditions or “co morbidities” makes diabetes management complex for the patient and for health care providers. Hence a strong need was felt to explore the problem of co morbidity among diabetics and its dimensions in primary health care practices. Method This cross sectional survey was carried out on 912 type 2 diabetes patients attending different urban primary health care facilities at Bhubaneswar. Data regarding existence of co morbidity and demographical details were elicited by a predesigned, pretested questionnaire“Diabetes Co morbidity Evaluation Tool in Primary Care (DCET- PC)”. Statistical analyses were done using STATA. Results Overall 84% had one ormore than one comorbid condition. The most frequent co morbid conditions were hypertension [62%], acid peptic disease [28%], chronic back ache [22%] and osteoarthritis [21%]. The median number of co morbid conditions among both males and females is 2[IQR = 2]. The range of the number of co morbid conditions was wider among males [0–14] than females [0–6]. The number of co morbidities was highest in the age group > = 60 across both sexes. Most of the male patients below 40 years of age had either single [53%] or three co morbidities [11%] whereas among female patients of the same age group single [40%] or two co morbidities [22%] were more predominantly present. Age was found to be a strong independent predictor for diabetes co morbidity. The odds of having co morbidity among people above poverty line and schedule caste were found to be[OR = 3.50; 95%CI 1.85–6.62]and [OR = 2.46; CI 95%1.16–5.25] respectively. Odds were increased for retired status [OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.01–3.91] and obesity [OR = 3.96; 95%CI 1.01–15.76]. Conclusion The results show a high prevalence of co morbidities in patients with type 2 diabetes attending urban primary health care facilities. Hypertension, acid peptic disease, chronic back ache and arthritis being the most common, strategies need to be designed taking into account the multiple demands of co morbidities."

The long-term consequences of DAA in a resistance trained population are currently unknown.To evaluate the effectiveness of DAA to alter basal testosterone levels over 3 months of resistance training in resistance-trained men.Randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in healthy resistance-trained men, aged 18-36, had been performing regular resistance training exercise for at least 3 d.w-1 for the previous 2 years. Randomised participants were 22 men (d-aspartic acid n = 11; placebo n = 11) (age, 23.8±4.9 y, training age, 3.2±1.5 y).D-aspartic acid (6 g.d-1, DAA) versus equal-weight, visually-matched placebo (PLA). All participants performed 12 weeks of supervised, periodised resistance training (4 d.w-1), with a program focusing on all muscle groups.Basal hormones, total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), estradiol (E2), sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin (ALB); isometric strength; calf muscle cross-sectional area (CSA); calf muscle thickness; quadriceps muscle CSA; quadriceps muscle thickness; evoked V-wave and H-reflexes, were assessed at weeks zero (T1), after six weeks (T2) and after 12 weeks (T3).No change in basal TT or FT were observed after the intervention. DAA supplementation (n = 10) led to a 16%, 95% CI [-27%, -5%] reduction in E2 from T1-T3 (p<0.01). The placebo group (n = 9) demonstrated improvements in spinal responsiveness (gastrocnemius) at the level of the alpha motoneuron. Both groups exhibited increases in isometric strength of the plantar flexors by 17%, 95% CI [7%, 28%] (p<0.05) as well as similar increases in hypertrophy in the quadriceps and calf muscles.The results of this paper indicate that DAA supplementation is ineffective at changing testosterone levels, or positively affecting training outcomes.

https://openalex.org/W2746566896,"Late leaf spot (LLS) is a major foliar disease in peanut (A. hypogaea L.) worldwide, causing significant losses of potential yield in the absence of fungicide applications. Mutants are important materials to study the function of disease-related genes. In this study, the mutant line M14 was derived from cultivar Yuanza 9102 treated with EMS. Yuanza 9102 was selected from an interspecific cross of cultivar Baisha 1016 with A. diogoi, and is resistant to several fungal diseases. By contrast, the M14 was highly susceptible to late leaf spot. RNA-Seq analysis in the leaf tissues of the M14 and its wild type Yuanza 9102 under pathogen challenge showed 2219 differentially expressed genes including1317 up-regulated genes and 902 down-regulated genes. Of these genes, 1541, 1988, 1344, 643 and 533 unigenes were obtained and annotated by public protein databases of SwissPort, TrEMBL, gene ontology (GO), KEGG and clusters of orthologous groups (COG), respectively. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that expression of inducible pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins was significantly up-regulated; in the meantime DEGs related to photosynthesis were down-regulated in the susceptible M14 in comparison to the resistant WT. Moreover, the up-regulated WRKY transcription factors and down-regulated plant hormones related to plant growth were detected in the M14. The results suggest that down-regulated chloroplast genes, up-regulated WRKY transcription factors, and depressed plant hormones related to plant growth in the M14 might coordinately render the susceptibility though there was a significant high level of PRs. Those negative effectors might be triggered in the susceptible plant by fungal infection and resulted in reduction of photosynthesis and phytohormones and led to symptom formation."
https://openalex.org/W2749102082,"Background The Tinnitus Sample Case History Questionnaire was determined as a standardized questionnaire for obtaining patient case histories and for characterizing patients into subgroups at the Tinnitus Research Initiative in 2006. In this study, we developed a Japanese version of this questionnaire for evaluating the clinical characteristics of patients with tinnitus. The Japanese version of the questionnaire will be available for evaluating treatments for tinnitus and for comparing data on tinnitus in research centers. Aims/Objectives To evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients with tinnitus in Japan using a newly developed Japanese version of Tinnitus Sample Case History Questionnaire. Study design This was a prospective study based on patient records. Setting University hospitals, general hospitals, and clinics. Subjects and methods We collected patient data using a Japanese translated version of the Tinnitus Sample Case History Questionnaire. In total, 584 patients who visited our institutions in Japan between August 2012 and March 2014 were included (280 males and 304 females; age 13–92 years; mean age, 60.8). We examined patients after dividing them into two groups according to the presence or absence of hyperacusis. The collected results were compared with those from the Tinnitus Research Initiative database. Results Compared with the TRI database, there were significantly more elderly female patients and fewer patients with trauma-associated tinnitus. There was a statistically lower ratio of patients with hyperacusis. We found that patients with tinnitus in addition to hyperacusis had greater tinnitus severity and exhibited higher rates of various complications. Conclusion The Japanese version of the Tinnitus Sample Case History Questionnaire developed in this study can be a useful tool for evaluating patients with tinnitus in Japan. The results of this multicenter study reflect the characteristics of patients with tinnitus who require medical care in Japan. Our data provides a preliminary basis for an international comparison of tinnitus epidemiology."
https://openalex.org/W2666338123,"Pursuit of one goal typically precludes simultaneous pursuit of another. Thus, each exclusive activity entails an ""opportunity cost:"" the forgone benefits from the next-best activity eschewed. The present experiment estimates, in laboratory rats, the function that maps objective opportunity costs into subjective ones. In an operant chamber, rewarding electrical brain stimulation was delivered when the cumulative time a lever had been depressed reached a criterion duration. The value of the activities forgone during this duration is the opportunity cost of the electrical reward. We determined which of four functions best describes how objective opportunity costs, expressed as the required duration of lever depression, are translated into their subjective equivalents. The simplest account is the identity function, which equates subjective and objective opportunity costs. A variant of this function called the ""sigmoidal-slope function,"" converges on the identity function at longer durations but deviates from it at shorter durations. The sigmoidal-slope function has the form of a hockey stick. The flat ""blade"" denotes a range over which opportunity costs are subjectively equivalent; these durations are too short to allow substitution of more beneficial activities. The blade extends into an upward-curving portion over which costs become discriminable and finally into the straight ""handle,"" over which objective and subjective costs match. The two remaining functions are based on hyperbolic and exponential temporal discounting, respectively. The results are best described by the sigmoidal-slope function. That this is so suggests that different principles of intertemporal choice are involved in the evaluation of time spent working for a reward or waiting for its delivery. The subjective opportunity-cost function plays a key role in the evaluation and selection of goals. An accurate description of its form and parameters is essential to successful modeling and prediction of instrumental performance and reward-related decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2749125037,"In heart transplantation (HTx) patients, routine surveillance endomyocardial biopsies (rsEMB) are recommended for the detection of early cardiac allograft rejection. However, there is no consensus on the optimal frequency of rsEMB. Frequent rsEMB have shown a low diagnostic yield in the new era of potent immunosuppressive regimen. Efficacy and safety of lower frequency rsEMB have not been investigated so far. In this retrospective, single centre, observational study we evaluated 282 patients transplanted between 2004 and 2014. 218 of these patients were investigated by rsEMB and symptom-triggered EMB (stEMB). We evaluated EMB results, complications, risk factors for rejection, survival 1 and 5 years as well as incidence of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) 3 years after HTx. A mean of 7.1 ± 2.5 rsEMB were conducted per patient within the first year after HTx identifying 7 patients with asymptomatic and 9 patients with symptomatic acute rejection requiring glucocorticoide pulse therapy. Despite this relatively low frequency of rsEMB, only 6 unscheduled stEMB were required in the first year after HTx leading to 2 additional treatments. In 6 deaths among all 282 patients (2.1%), acute rejection could not be ruled out as a potential underlying cause. Overall survival at 1 year was 78.7% and 5-year survival was 74%. Incidence of CAV was 17% at 3-year follow-up. Morbidity and mortality of lower frequency rsEMB are comparable with data from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) registry. Consensus is needed on the optimal frequency of EMB."
https://openalex.org/W2750386774,"Neurons in the somatosensory cortex are exquisitely sensitive to mechanical stimulation of the skin surface. The location, velocity, direction, and adaptation of tactile stimuli on the skin’s surface are discriminable features of somatosensory processing, however the representation and processing of dynamic tactile arrays in the human somatosensory cortex are poorly understood. The principal aim of this study was to map the relation between dynamic saltatory pneumatic stimuli at discrete traverse velocities on the glabrous hand and the resultant pattern of evoked BOLD response in the human brain. Moreover, we hypothesized that the hand representation in contralateral Brodmann Area (BA) 3b would show a significant dependence on stimulus velocity. Saltatory pneumatic pulses (60 ms duration, 9.5 ms rise/fall) were repetitively sequenced through a 7-channel TAC-Cell array at traverse velocities of 5, 25, and 65 cm/s on the glabrous hand initiated at the tips of D2 (index finger) and D3 (middle finger) and sequenced towards the D1 (thumb). The resulting hemodynamic response was sampled during 3 functional MRI scans (BOLD) in 20 neurotypical right-handed adults at 3T. Results from each subject were inserted to the one-way ANOVA within-subjects and one sample t-test to evaluate the group main effect of all three velocities stimuli and each of three different velocities, respectively. The stimulus evoked BOLD response revealed a dynamic representation of saltatory pneumotactile stimulus velocity in a network consisting of the contralateral primary hand somatosensory cortex (BA3b), associated primary motor cortex (BA4), posterior insula, and ipsilateral deep cerebellum. The spatial extent of this network was greatest at the 5 and 25 cm/s pneumotactile stimulus velocities."
https://openalex.org/W2749923077,"Background There is growing interest in using diet counselling in the management of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Among new emerging diets, vegetarian diets (VD) seem to be experiencing an important popularity, partly because of their alleged health benefits. A recent study performed among a rural Indian population showed that predominant VD could be associated with IBS. Objective This cross-sectional study aimed at assessing the association between the VD and IBS, among a large French cohort, the NutriNet-santé study. Methods Subjects participating in the NutriNet-Santé cohort study completed a questionnaire based on Rome III criteria (N = 41,682). Anthropometrics, socio-demographical and lifestyle data, including VD, were collected prior to the completion of Rome III questionnaire via self-administered questionnaires. Association between VD and IBS and its subtypes was investigated through multivariate logistic regression. Results The included subjects were mainly women (78.0%) and the mean age was 49.8±14.3 years. Among these individuals, 2,264 (5.4%) presented an IBS, and 805 (1.9%) reported a VD. Overall, VD was not associated with IBS or subtypes. A stable VD (i.e. self-declared at least three times) was associated with IBS (aOR 2.60 95%CI [1.37–4.91]), IBS mixed (aOR 2.97 95%CI [1.20–7.36]) and IBS diarrhoea (aOR 2.77 95%CI [1.01–7.59]). Conclusions This study suggests that a long term VD could be associated with IBS. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to confirm these results, and investigate the multiple aspects of the vegetarian diet, possibly related to the IBS."

https://openalex.org/W2749351878,"Gene flow between species may last a long time in plants. Reticulation inevitably causes difficulties in phylogenetic reconstruction. In this study, we looked into the genetic divergence and phylogeny of 20 Lilium species based on multilocus analyses of 8 genes of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), the internally transcribed nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrITS) spacer and 20 loci extracted from the expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries of L. longiflorum Thunb. and L. formosanum Wallace. The phylogeny based on the combined data of the maternally inherited cpDNA and nrITS was largely consistent with the taxonomy of Lilium sections. This phylogeny was deemed the hypothetical species tree and uncovered three groups, i.e., Cluster A consisting of 4 taxa from the sections Pseudolirium and Liriotypus, Cluster B consisting of the 4 taxa from the sections Leucolirion, Archelirion and Daurolirion, and Cluster C comprising 10 taxa mostly from the sections Martagon and Sinomartagon. In contrast, systematic inconsistency occurred across the EST loci, with up to 19 genes (95%) displaying tree topologies deviating from the hypothetical species tree. The phylogenetic incongruence was likely attributable to the frequent genetic exchanges between species/sections, as indicated by the high levels of genetic recombination and the IMa analyses with the EST loci. Nevertheless, multilocus analysis could provide complementary information among the loci on the species split and the extent of gene flow between the species. In conclusion, this study not only detected frequent gene flow among Lilium sections that resulted in phylogenetic incongruence but also reconstructed a hypothetical species tree that gave insights into the nature of the complex relationships among Lilium species."
https://openalex.org/W2748792301,"Vesicular transport of cellular cargo requires targeted membrane fusion and formation of a SNARE protein complex that draws the two apposing fusing membranes together. Insulin-regulated delivery and fusion of glucose transporter-4 storage vesicles at the cell surface is dependent on two key proteins: the SNARE integral membrane protein Syntaxin4 (Sx4) and the soluble regulatory protein Munc18c. Many reported in vitro studies of Munc18c:Sx4 interactions and of SNARE complex formation have used soluble Sx4 constructs lacking the native transmembrane domain. As a consequence, the importance of the Sx4 C-terminal anchor remains poorly understood. Here we show that soluble C-terminally truncated Sx4 dissociates more rapidly from Munc18c than Sx4 where the C-terminal transmembrane domain is replaced with a T4-lysozyme fusion. We also show that Munc18c appears to inhibit SNARE complex formation when soluble C-terminally truncated Sx4 is used but does not inhibit SNARE complex formation when Sx4 is C-terminally anchored (by a C-terminal His-tag bound to resin, by a C-terminal T4L fusion or by the native C-terminal transmembrane domain in detergent micelles). We conclude that the C-terminus of Sx4 is critical for its interaction with Munc18c, and that the reported inhibitory role of Munc18c may be an artifact of experimental design. These results support the notion that a primary role of Munc18c is to support SNARE complex formation and membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2747737827,"Estimating cropland latent heat flux (LE) from continental to global scales is vital to modeling crop production and managing water resources. Over the past several decades, numerous LE models were developed, such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer LE (MOD16) algorithm, revised remote sensing-based Penman-Monteith LE algorithm (RRS), the Priestley-Taylor LE algorithm of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) and the modified satellite-based Priestley-Taylor LE algorithm (MS-PT). However, these LE models have not been directly compared over the global cropland ecosystem using various algorithms. In this study, we evaluated the performances of these four LE models using 34 eddy covariance (EC) sites. The results showed that mean annual LE for cropland varied from 33.49 to 58.97 W/m2 among the four models. The interannual LE slightly increased during 1982-2009 across the global cropland ecosystem. All models had acceptable performances with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of approximately 35 W/m2. MS-PT had good overall performance across the cropland ecosystem with the highest R2, lowest RMSE and a relatively low bias. The reduced performances of MOD16 and RRS, with R2 ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 and RMSEs from 30 to 39 W/m2, might be attributed to empirical parameters in the structure algorithms and calibrated coefficients."
https://openalex.org/W2747864816,"We present here results of a theoretical investigation of particle transport in longitudinally asymmetric but axially symmetric capillaries, allowing for the influence of both diffusion and convection. In this study we have focused attention primarily on characterizing the influence of tube geometry and applied hydraulic pressure on the magnitude, direction and rate of transport of particles in axi-symmetric, saw-tooth shaped tubes. Three initial value problems are considered. The first involves the evolution of a fixed number of particles initially confined to a central wave-section. The second involves the evolution of the same initial state but including an ongoing production of particles in the central wave-section. The third involves the evolution of particles a fully laden tube. Based on a physical model of convective-diffusive transport, assuming an underlying oscillatory fluid velocity field that is unaffected by the presence of the particles, we find that transport rates and even net transport directions depend critically on the design specifics, such as tube geometry, flow rate, initial particle configuration and whether or not particles are continuously introduced. The second transient scenario is qualitatively independent of the details of how particles are generated. In the third scenario there is no net transport. As the study is fundamental in nature, our findings could engender greater understanding of practical systems."

Our central result is that threshold-activated dispersal leads to stable fixed populations, for a wide range of threshold levels. Further, suppression of chaos is facilitated when the threshold-activated migration is more rapid than the intrinsic population dynamics of a patch. Additionally, networks with large number of nodes open to the environment, readily yield stable steady states. Lastly we demonstrate that in networks with very few open nodes, the degree and betweeness centrality of the node open to the environment has a pronounced influence on control. All qualitative trends are corroborated by quantitative measures, reflecting the efficiency of control, and the width of the steady state window."

At least three appear to have been hit by ships, and one perished after becoming entangled in fishing gear. In a bid to prevent more losses, Canadian officials have imposed new restrictions on shipping and fishing until the whales migrate south later this year. In September, Canadian officials plan to start consulting with the fishing and shipping industries about what to do next. Some scientists speculate that the whales are looking for new sources of food, perhaps driven north by warming seas. Others are testing underwater gliders equipped with sound sensors that can detect right whales, part of a system that could send alerts to nearby ships."
https://openalex.org/W2747788203,"Authors of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) disclose financial conflicts of interest (FCOIs) to promote transparency ethics. Typically, they do so on standard declaration forms containing generic open-ended questions on FCOIs. Yet, the literature is scant on the format and effect of alternative disclosure forms. Does supplementing a standard form with subsequent detailed disclosure forms tailored to the context of the CPG improve the yield or accuracy of FCOIs declarations?For an international CPG in gastroenterology on the endoscopic surveillance for colorectal neoplasia in inflammatory bowel disease, we compared the use of a standard FCOIs disclosure form with a contextual FCOIs disclosure form that detailed commercial relations related to the CPG topic. This included manufacturers of endoscopes, endoscopy equipment and accessories. Participants completed the generic form early, and the supplementary contextual form six months later. We then compared the FCOI disclosures obtained.26 participants provided FCOIs disclosures using both disclosure forms. We found discrepancies regarding (1) the disclosure of FCOIs (presence/absence), and (2) the listing of financial entities. While the number of participants who disclosed a FCOI remained the same (30.8%) using the two forms, disclosures were not from the same individuals: two additional participants disclosed a FCOI, whereas two participants withdrew previous disclosures. Among those who reported a FCOI in either form, we noted inconsistencies in disclosures for 70% of the participants. This included changes in FCOIs disclosure status or modifications of ""their commercial relations"".Accurate reporting of FCOIs advances the transparency and ethical integrity of CPGs. Our experience suggests that a contextual FCOIs disclosure form tailored to content of the CPG with narrow, detailed questions provides supplementary, more complete FCOIs declarations than generic forms alone. The finding raises challenges on how forms are best written and formatted, optimally timed, and more effectively processed with sensitivity to professional behaviour, so as to heighten transparency."

Although a few reports have analysed the utility of GTT in other subtypes, more studies using HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) are needed, considering the huge contribution of HIV-1C to the global epidemic.Plasma was obtained from 420 treatment-naïve HIV-1C infected Ethiopians recruited 2009-2011. The V3 region was sequenced and the coreceptor usage was predicted by five tools: Geno2Pheno clinical-and clonal-models, PhenoSeq-C, C-PSSM and Raymond's algorithm. The impact of baseline tropism on antiretroviral treatment (ART) outcome was evaluated.Of 352 patients with successful baseline V3 sequences, the proportion of predicted R5 virus varied between the methods by 12.5% (78.1%-90.6%). However, only 58.2% of the predictions were concordant and only 1.7% were predicted to be X4-tropic across the five methods. Compared pairwise, the highest concordance was between C-PSSM and Geno2Pheno clonal (86.4%). In bivariate intention to treat (ITT) analysis, R5 infected patients achieved treatment success more frequently than X4 infected at month six as predicted by Geno2Pheno clinical (77.8% vs 58.7%, P = 0.004) and at month 12 by C-PSSM (61.9% vs 46.6%, P = 0.038). However, in the multivariable analysis adjusted for age, gender, baseline CD4 and viral load, only tropism as predicted by C-PSSM showed an impact on month 12 (P = 0.04, OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.06-5.79).Each of the bioinformatics models predicted R5 tropism with comparable frequency but there was a large discordance between the methods. Baseline tropism had an impact on outcome of first line ART at month 12 in multivariable ITT analysis but only based on prediction by C-PSSM which thus possibly could be used for predicting outcome of ART in HIV-1C infected Ethiopians."

We present PhyQuart, a new method for evaluating the three possible binary trees for any quartet of taxa. PhyQuart was developed through a process of reciprocal illumination between a priori considerations and the results of extensive simulations. It is based on identification of site-patterns that can be considered to support a particular quartet tree taking into account the Hennigian distinction between apomorphic and plesiomorphic similarity, and employing corrections to the raw observed frequencies of site-patterns that exploit expectations from maximum likelihood estimation. We demonstrate through extensive simulation experiments that, whereas maximum likeilihood estimation performs well in many cases, it can be outperformed by PhyQuart in cases where it fails due to extreme branch length asymmetries producing long-branch attraction artefacts where there is only very minor model misspecification."
https://openalex.org/W2748597923,"Anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) is one of the main surgical strategies for the management of multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy (MCSM). High complication rates of graft bone fracture, resorption, displacement, and fusion collapse or pseudarthrosis have been previously reported. The strategies to prevent the aforementioned complications include using fresh frozen cortical strut allograft (FFCSA) to keep most of the original bone quality and using additional anterior plate fixation to improve the fusion stability and union rate. In this study, we evaluated 4-year follow-ups for surgical outcomes and analyzed the risk factors of MCSM patients who received 2-level ACCF with FFCSA and titanium dynamic plate fixation. We retrospectively collected preoperative and postoperative radiographic and clinical data of patients from 2005 to 2009; the inclusion criteria were having been diagnosed as MCSM and having received 2-level ACCF with an FFCSA fibular shaft and an anterior dynamic plate. The cervical curvature lordosis improved and the neurogenic function recovered well postoperatively. Visual analog scale for neck pain and neck disability index scores both decreased after 12 and 48 months following surgery. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association score recovery rate at postoperative 4 years was 87.5%. Fusion rates achieved 100% at 12 months. The preoperative Nurick score seemed to be the only significant risk factor correlated with the functional recovery rate at 4 years after the surgery. In conclusion, based on a minimum 4-year follow-up of 2-level ACCF with FFCSA and dynamic titanium plates for patients with MCSM, the surgical results were satisfying and the complication rates were low."

Farmers can select to grow plant varieties that both surprise and delight even the most sophisticated taste buds. Nutrient content and crop yields are improved to fight hunger and malnutrition in vulnerable populations. Vibrant floral varieties can be grown in your home garden that not only exhibit optimized fragrance profiles, but also emit their lovely aromas in robust and conveniently timed bursts. With modern plant genomics offering unprecedented access to the genetic basis of phenotypes and with gene editing technologies allowing precision modulation, such a far-fetched, sci-fi reality might actually be within foreseeable reach. Since the dawn of cultivation efforts, horticulturalists have used selective breeding practices to foster advantageous qualities. Such human interventions have drastically changed domesticated plant varieties relative to their wild precursors. Traditionally, this process takes a considerable amount of time, as well as a certain amount of luck. Likewise, breeders have often focused on instilling traits like disease resistance and size, which have in some instances resulted in unwanted side effects on other desirable traits like flavor. In the genomic age of modern horticulture, however, plant scientists can now identify the genetic underpinnings of desirable traits nearly down to the nucleotide. Such knowledge then paves the way for genetically engineered plants with a multitude of advantageous qualities. Along these lines, work from Harry Klee and Sanwen Huang, published earlier this year in Science, employed a clever use of genomics to identify the genetic loci responsible for the loss of flavor in commercial tomato varieties (Tieman et al., 2017Tieman D. Zhu G. Resende Jr., M.F. Lin T. Nguyen C. Bies D. Rambla J.L. Beltran K.S. Taylor M. Zhang B. et al.Science. 2017; 355: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In order to identify where commercial tomatoes had gone awry, flavor-associated chemicals were quantified in nearly 400 modern, heirloom, and wild tomato varieties. In agreement with consumer taste preferences, they find that commercial strains contain lower levels of chemicals linked to enhanced flavor compared to older varieties. Whole-genome sequencing paired with genome-wide association studies yields several loci that affect many of these flavor chemicals. This clearer picture of the genetic loci associated with tomato flavor will inform molecular breeding efforts aimed at bringing back lost flavor. With successful adaptations of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing platform in a number of plant species, we have the tools for rapid and precise genome editing such that we can actually do something about it (Ma et al., 2016Ma X. Zhu Q. Chen Y. Liu Y.G. Mol. Plant. 2016; 9: 961-974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Similar strategies in other agricultural organisms, aimed at improving flavor or even nutritional content, could dramatically improve the fruits and vegetables we eat every day. Tomato cultivation continues as a hot topic in 2017, with a study from Lippman and colleagues setting their sights on attacking inflorescence architecture in order to increase yields (Soyk et al., 2017Soyk S. Lemmon Z.H. Oved M. Fisher J. Liberatore K.L. Park S.J. Goren A. Jiang K. Ramos A. van der Knaap E. et al.Cell. 2017; 169: 1142-1155.e12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Because selecting for increased branching has long been marred with the unwanted side effect of sterility, improving tomato inflorescence had remained a difficult aspect of tomato biology to address. Exploiting both natural and engineered CRISPR/Cas9 generated alleles, they could produce a range of branching phenotypes. This sophisticated use of molecular breeding thus allows breeders to bypass an issue that had long plagued efforts to improve this aspect of tomato cultivation. Advances in our understanding of how plant volatile organic compound (VOC) emission is regulated and achieved could open up new possibilities in generating cultivars with improved fragrant properties. Even though we knew that the production of floral volatiles has a temporally regulated pattern, until recently, it has been assumed that VOCs are released simply by passive diffusion. Yet, challenging this assumption, a calculation has suggested that toxic levels of VOCs should accumulate if left solely up to diffusion for emission (Widhalm et al., 2015Widhalm J.R. Jaini R. Morgan J.A. Dudareva N. Trends Plant Sci. 2015; 20: 545-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A study out of Natalia Dudareva’s lab, published in the June 30 issue of Science, used a genomics-based approach to identify the first ABC transporter responsible for the active transport of VOCs (Adebesin et al., 2017Adebesin F. Widhalm J.R. Boachon B. Lefèvre F. Pierman B. Lynch J.H. Alam I. Junqueira B. Benke R. Ray S. et al.Science. 2017; 356: 1386-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In order to identify candidate VOC transporters, they utilized the fact that VOC emission dramatically increases in Petunias across a certain developmental window. Hedging their bets that transcription of the transporter might also be similarly regulated, they compared transcriptome-wide RNA expression profiles in petals across this developmental transition. This strategy paid off, and they successfully validate a predicted plasma-membrane transporter of unknown function as a bona fide VOC transporter. Moreover, loss-of-function studies provided evidence that, as predicted, active protein-mediated VOC transport is important to avoid damage from VOC accumulation. Combining this knowledge with well-characterized biochemical synthesis pathways and recent work illuminating the circadian transcriptional regulatory network of floral scent production in Petunia, a near complete picture emerges (Fenske et al., 2015Fenske M.P. Hewett Hazelton K.D. Hempton A.K. Shim J.S. Yamamoto B.M. Riffell J.A. Imaizumi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 9775-9780Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such information could be used to re-engineer flowers with improved fragrance properties. For instance, not only could delightful olfactory experiences be created within the context of home and public garden spaces, but also, the perfume industry might be able to use this knowledge to amplify scents in agricultural production. With massive amounts of genomic data on the way via the 1,000 plant transcriptome project and the recently announced effort to sequence 10,000 plant genomes, the trove of information yet to be uncovered is tantalizing. While wading through this sea of information will surely be daunting, the potential benefits are already cultivating excitement."
