https://openalex.org/W2057454789,Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkylsiloxanes on elastomeric PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) were used as model systems to study interactions between surfaces. Surface free energies (gammasv) of these chemically modified surfaces were estimated by measuring the deformations that resulted from the contact between small semispherical lenses and flat sheets of the elastomer under controlled loads. The measured surface free energies correlated with the surface chemical compositions of the SAMs and were commensurate with the values estimated from the measurements of contact angles. This study provides direct experimental evidence for the validity of estimates of the surface free energies of low-energy solids obtained from contact angles.
https://openalex.org/W2074080011,"The rotational dynamics of C(60) in the solid state have been investigated with carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance ((13)C NMR). The relaxation rate due to chemical shift anisotropy (1/9T1(CSA)(1)) was precisely measured from the magnetic field dependence of T(1), allowing the molecular reorientational correlation time, tau, to be determined. At 283 kelvin, tau = 9.1 picoseconds; with the assumption of diffusional reorientation this implies a rotational diffusion constant D = 1.8 x 10(10) per second. This reorientation time is only three times as long as the calculated tau for free rotation and is shorter than the value measured for C(60) in solution (15.5 picoseconds). Below 260 kelvin a second phase with a much longer reorientation time was observed, consistent with recent reports of an orientational phase transition in solid C(60). In both phases tau showed Arrhenius behavior, with apparent activation energies of 1.4 and 4.2 kilocalories per mole for the high-temperature (rotator) and low-temperature (ratchet) phases, respectively. The results parallel those found for adamantane."

These capabilities are demonstrated for decaborane(14) (B10H14) molecules adsorbed on a silicon(111)-(7 Ã— 7) surface. In addition to basic studies, such selective dissociation processes can be used in a variety of applications to control surface chemistry on the molecular scale."
https://openalex.org/W1973811075,"High-temperature creep experiments on polycrystalline perovskite (CaTiO(3)), an analog of (Mg,Fe)SiO(3) perovskite of the lower mantle, suggest that (grain size-sensitive) diffusion creep is important in the lower mantle and show that creep rate is enhanced by the transformation from the orthorhombic to the tetragonal structure. These observations suggest that grain-size reduction after a subducting slab passes through the 670-kilometer discontinuity or after a phase transformation from orthorhombic to tetragonal in perovskite will result in rheological softening in the top portions of the lower mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2078878200,"Stratigraphic patterns preserved under translating surface undulations or ripples in a depositional eolian environment are computed on a grain by grain basis using physically based cellular automata models. The spontaneous appearance, growth, and motion of the simulated ripples correspond in many respects to the behavior of natural ripples. The simulations show that climbing strata can be produced by impact alone; direct action of fluid shear is unnecessary. The model provides a means for evaluating the connection between mechanical processes occurring in the paleoenvironment during deposition and the resulting stratigraphy preserved in the geologic column: vertical compression of small laminae above a planar surface indicates nascent ripple growth; supercritical laminae are associated with unusually intense deposition episodes; and a plane erosion surface separating sets of well-developed laminae is consistent with continued migration of mature ripples during a hiatus in deposition."
https://openalex.org/W2055972572,"Electromagnetic fields, with the noise on one quadrature component reduced to below the quantum mechanical zero-point fluctuation level and the noise on the other quadrature component enhanced to above it, are currently of great interest in quantum optics because of their potential applications to various precision measurements. Such squeezed states of light are usually produced by imposing nonlinear unitary evolution on coherent (or vacuum) states. On the other hand, squeezed states with reduced photon number noise and enhanced phase noise are generated directly by a constant current-driven semiconductor laser. This is the simplest scheme for the generation of nonclassical light, and so far it has yielded the largest quantum noise reduction. The mutual coupling between a lasing junction and an external electrical circuit provides opportunities for exploring the macroscopic and microscopic quantum effects in open systems."

https://openalex.org/W2046887629,"In the aftermath of the GulfWar, revelations about Iraq's extensive program to develop nuclear weapons challenge the future of the international nuclear nonproliferation regime. Until inspections sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council began, Iraq's violations of its obligations under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its related safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency went undetected. The ultimate impact of Iraq's behavior on the regime cannot yet be determined, but there is now an opportunity to improve safeguards and other aspects of the regime, including strengthening export controls and proliferation intelligence collection and sharing and the development of appropriate response capabilities."
