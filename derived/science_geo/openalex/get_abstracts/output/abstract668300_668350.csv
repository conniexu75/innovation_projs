Eight weeks after the second injection of vaccine, volunteers showed high levels of IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) and receptor-binding-domain (RBD) binding titre. Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity and relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B cells of vaccinated volunteers were equivalent to those of individuals who had recovered from natural infection5,6. However, activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants that encode E484K-, N501Y- or K417N/E484K/N501-mutant S was reduced by a small-but significant-margin. The monoclonal antibodies elicited by the vaccines potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and target a number of different RBD epitopes in common with monoclonal antibodies isolated from infected donors5-8. However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most-potent monoclonal antibodies that we tested was reduced or abolished by the K417N, E484K or N501Y mutation. Notably, these mutations were selected when we cultured recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing SARS-CoV-2 S in the presence of the monoclonal antibodies elicited by the vaccines. Together, these results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated periodically to avoid a potential loss of clinical efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3126160703,"Abstract The Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) programme seeks to elucidate the genetic architecture and biology of heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders, with the ultimate goal of improving diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these diseases. The initial phases of the programme focused on whole-genome sequencing of individuals with rich phenotypic data and diverse backgrounds. Here we describe the TOPMed goals and design as well as the available resources and early insights obtained from the sequence data. The resources include a variant browser, a genotype imputation server, and genomic and phenotypic data that are available through dbGaP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes) 1 . In the first 53,831 TOPMed samples, we detected more than 400 million single-nucleotide and insertion or deletion variants after alignment with the reference genome. Additional previously undescribed variants were detected through assembly of unmapped reads and customized analysis in highly variable loci. Among the more than 400 million detected variants, 97% have frequencies of less than 1% and 46% are singletons that are present in only one individual (53% among unrelated individuals). These rare variants provide insights into mutational processes and recent human evolutionary history. The extensive catalogue of genetic variation in TOPMed studies provides unique opportunities for exploring the contributions of rare and noncoding sequence variants to phenotypic variation. Furthermore, combining TOPMed haplotypes with modern imputation methods improves the power and reach of genome-wide association studies to include variants down to a frequency of approximately 0.01%."

We use vacuum squeezing to circumvent the quantum limit in a search for a new particle. By preparing a microwave-frequency electromagnetic field in a squeezed state and near-noiselessly reading out only the squeezed quadrature, we double the search rate for axions over a mass range favored by recent theoretical projections. We observe no signature of dark matter axions in the combined $16.96-17.12$ and $17.14-17.28\space\mu\text{eV}/c^2$ mass window for axion-photon couplings above $g_{\gamma} = 1.38\times g_{\gamma}^\text{KSVZ}$, reporting exclusion at the 90% level."
https://openalex.org/W3126278083,"Accurate 3D imaging is essential for machines to map and interact with the physical world. While numerous 3D imaging technologies exist, each addressing niche applications with varying degrees of success, none have achieved the breadth of applicability and impact that digital image sensors have achieved in the 2D imaging world. A large-scale two-dimensional array of coherent detector pixels operating as a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system could serve as a universal 3D imaging platform. Such a system would offer high depth accuracy and immunity to interference from sunlight, as well as the ability to directly measure the velocity of moving objects. However, due to difficulties in providing electrical and photonic connections to every pixel, previous systems have been restricted to fewer than 20 pixels. Here, we demonstrate the first large-scale coherent detector array consisting of 512 ($32 \times 16$) pixels, and its operation in a 3D imaging system. Leveraging recent advances in the monolithic integration of photonic and electronic circuits, a dense array of optical heterodyne detectors is combined with an integrated electronic readout architecture, enabling straightforward scaling to arbitrarily large arrays. Meanwhile, two-axis solid-state beam steering eliminates any tradeoff between field of view and range. Operating at the quantum noise limit, our system achieves an accuracy of $3.1~\mathrm{mm}$ at a distance of 75 metres using only $4~\mathrm{mW}$ of light, an order of magnitude more accurate than existing solid-state systems at such ranges. Future reductions of pixel size using state-of-the-art components could yield resolutions in excess of 20 megapixels for arrays the size of a consumer camera sensor. This result paves the way for the development and proliferation of low cost, compact, and high performance 3D imaging cameras."
https://openalex.org/W3127832690,"Skeletal muscle regenerates through the activation of resident stem cells. Termed satellite cells, these normally quiescent cells are induced to proliferate by wound-derived signals1. Identifying the source and nature of these cues has been hampered by an inability to visualize the complex cell interactions that occur within the wound. Here we use muscle injury models in zebrafish to systematically capture the interactions between satellite cells and the innate immune system after injury, in real time, throughout the repair process. This analysis revealed that a specific subset of macrophages ‘dwell’ within the injury, establishing a transient but obligate niche for stem cell proliferation. Single-cell profiling identified proliferative signals that are secreted by dwelling macrophages, which include the cytokine nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt, which is also known as visfatin or PBEF in humans). Nampt secretion from the macrophage niche is required for muscle regeneration, acting through the C-C motif chemokine receptor type 5 (Ccr5), which is expressed on muscle stem cells. This analysis shows that in addition to their ability to modulate the immune response, specific macrophage populations also provide a transient stem-cell-activating niche, directly supplying proliferation-inducing cues that govern the repair process that is mediated by muscle stem cells. This study demonstrates that macrophage-derived niche signals for muscle stem cells, such as NAMPT, can be applied as new therapeutic modalities for skeletal muscle injury and disease. Specific macrophage populations provide a transient niche that activates muscle stem cells after muscle injury and supply proliferation-inducing cues that govern the repair process mediated by these cells in both zebrafish and mouse injury models."
https://openalex.org/W3127836601,"Steels with sub-micrometre grain sizes usually possess high toughness and strength, which makes them promising for lightweighting technologies and energy-saving strategies. So far, the industrial fabrication of ultrafine-grained (UFG) alloys, which generally relies on the manipulation of diffusional phase transformation, has been limited to steels with austenite-to-ferrite transformation1-3. Moreover, the limited work hardening and uniform elongation of these UFG steels1,4,5 hinder their widespread application. Here we report the facile mass production of UFG structures in a typical Fe-22Mn-0.6C twinning-induced plasticity steel by minor Cu alloying and manipulation of the recrystallization process through the intragranular nanoprecipitation (within 30 seconds) of a coherent disordered Cu-rich phase. The rapid and copious nanoprecipitation not only prevents the growth of the freshly recrystallized sub-micrometre grains but also enhances the thermal stability of the obtained UFG structure through the Zener pinning mechanism6. Moreover, owing to their full coherency and disordered nature, the precipitates exhibit weak interactions with dislocations under loading. This approach enables the preparation of a fully recrystallized UFG structure with a grain size of 800 ± 400 nanometres without the introduction of detrimental lattice defects such as brittle particles and segregated boundaries. Compared with the steel to which no Cu was added, the yield strength of the UFG structure was doubled to around 710 megapascals, with a uniform ductility of 45 per cent and a tensile strength of around 2,000 megapascals. This grain-refinement concept should be extendable to other alloy systems, and the manufacturing processes can be readily applied to existing industrial production lines."

Unraveling the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the generation of specialized cell types and their coordinated functions is critical for deepening our understanding of organ development, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration. Recombinase-mediated genetic targeting provides an important platform to track cellular origins and fates in vivo, while also elucidating the genetic regulation of cell behavior in multiple biological processes, such as embryogenesis, tumorigenesis, and tissue regeneration (Kretzschmar and Watt, 2012Kretzschmar K.

Over the past three decades, among many types of recombinases, the Cre-loxP system represents the most widely used approach for in vivo molecular and cellular study in animal models (Sauer and Henderson, 1988Sauer B.

The linchpin of this system for precise genetic manipulation depends on the specificity of the genetic promoter used to express Cre (Molkentin and Houser, 2013Molkentin J.D. Houser S.R.

Zhou B. Cellular origin and developmental program of coronary angiogenesis.Circ. Res. 2015; 116: 515-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, many of the Cre drivers used are not sufficiently specific, inadvertently resulting in inaccurate data interpretation and thus sometimes in contradictory conclusions regarding cell fate and gene function analyses (Eschenhagen et al., 2017Eschenhagen T. Bolli R. Braun T. Field L.J. Fleischmann B.K. Frisén J. Giacca M. Hare J.M. Houser S.

Heart regeneration by endogenous stem cells and cardiomyocyte proliferation: controversy, fallacy, and progress.Circulation. 2020; 142: 275-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Indeed, this lack of specificity of single promoters to drive Cre expression is highlighted by recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology that has identified the genetic complexity of numerous cell populations within a given tissue (Cohen et al., 2018Cohen M.

One important way to understand newly identified cell sub-types requires their in vivo manipulation at both the cellular and molecular levels, so that one can understand if the cells play critical function(s) during normo- and pathophysiology. Although many new markers have been identified to define these subpopulations of cells, most often it is technically challenging to use a single marker to genetically target a specific sub-type of cells in vivo. It has been reported that other orthogonal recombinases could be combined with Cre-loxP (Jensen et al., 2008Jensen P. Farago A.F. Awatramani R.B. Scott M.M. Deneris E.S. Dymecki S.M.

Recently, a suite of diverse reporters that respond to the recombinases Cre, Dre, and Flpe has permitted enhanced cell type targeting and functionality in vivo (Daigle et al., 2018Daigle T.L.

Liu Q. et al.Genetic lineage tracing of nonmyocyte population by dual recombinases.Circulation. 2018; 138: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the demand for genetic tools with enhanced specificity and performance still far exceeds their current availability (Zhao and Zhou, 2019Zhao H. Zhou B. Dual genetic approaches for deciphering cell fate plasticity in vivo: more than double.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2019; 61: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We therefore aimed to generate a diverse set of cell type-specific mouse lines for the Dre recombinase, which is orthogonal to the Cre-loxP system (Anastassiadis et al., 2009Anastassiadis K. Fu J. Patsch C. Hu S. Weidlich S. Duerschke K. Buchholz F. Edenhofer F. Stewart A.F. Dre recombinase, like Cre, is a highly efficient site-specific recombinase in E. coli, mammalian cells and mice.Dis.

In the present study, we generated more than 70 new Dre lines, which, together with several distinct types of intersectional genetic approaches also reported here, provide an invaluable genetic tool of broad utility in multiple diverse life science fields. Several decades of pioneering research into adipogenesis have consistently suggested that de novo formation of adipocytes takes place close to the vessel wall, leading to the inference of the existence of perivascular stem cells or progenitors (Gesta et al., 2007Gesta S.

Additional studies using different Cre drivers support a mural cell origin of adipocytes in the adult stage (Long et al., 2014Long J.Z. Svensson K.J. Tsai L. Zeng X. Roh H.C. Kong X. Rao R.R. Lou J.

However, another recent study showed that pericytes or smooth muscle cells labeled by Tbx18-CreER maintained their identity in diverse pathological settings without contributing to other cell lineages (e.g., adipocytes) (Guimarães-Camboa et al., 2017Guimarães-Camboa N.

Studies using Pdgfra labeling reported that perivascular PDGFRa+ cells make a significant contribution to mature adipocytes in adult fat depots (Lee et al., 2012Lee Y.H. Petkova A.P. Mottillo E.P.

Despite reported specific and efficient labeling of mural cells by the aforementioned markers, such as PDGFRb (Vishvanath et al., 2017Vishvanath L. Long J.Z. Spiegelman B.M. Gupta R.K. Do adipocytes emerge from mural progenitors?.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 20: 585-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), PDGFRb is also reported to be expressed in a subset of adventitial fibroblasts (Guimarães-Camboa and Evans, 2017Guimarães-Camboa N.

Here we used intersectional genetic approach to re-assess the contribution of perivascular stem cells marked by distinct gene signatures to adipocytes in adult tissues. In addition to enhancing the precision of genetic lineage tracing, intersectional genetics enables more specific gene deletion in cell lineages that is not achievable with previous Cre-loxP strategies. Here we provided two examples on how to use NOT or AND logic to perform any flox gene deletion specifically in tissues that have not been previously achieved using singular Cre drivers. By developing NOT-logic sequential intersectional genetics, we successfully delete genes specifically in white adipocytes (WAs). Using AND-logic sequential intersectional genetics, we generated the first authentic Cre driver for both lineage tracing and gene deletion exclusively in lymphatic vessels. Our expansion here of the available Dre driver suite increases the ability to genetically manipulate cell lineages of interest more precisely, allowing a deeper understanding of cell behaviors and gene functions in multiple life science disciplines. To enable the broader application of intersectional approaches in multiple fields, we developed more than 70 new genetic drivers, each of which was based mainly on a Dre or DreER strategy. In these new mouse lines, cDNA encoding Dre or DreER was knocked into the endogenous gene locus by replacing the translational start codon (ATG) using CRISPR-Cas9 (Figure 1A). For some alleles, it is critical to keep the endogenous gene intact, as the heterozygote state might have functional effects on cells. For this purpose, cDNA encoding Dre or DreER linked downstream to an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or self-cleaved 2A peptide was then knocked into the translational stop codon just upstream of the 3′ UTR (Figure 1B). For the first strategy, we named the mouse line gene name-Dre or gene name-DreER, and for the second strategy we named the lines gene name-2A/IRES-Dre or gene name-DreER. The nomenclatures reflect the different targeting strategies in this study. Of all these knockin mouse lines, the majority were generated by homologous recombination using CRISPR-Cas9, while a few were generated by a conventional embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based strategy using positive and negative selection of correct targeted clones. To systematically characterize the Dre or DreER drivers, we crossed each of these mice with Dre-rox-responsive tdTomato or ZsGreen reporter lines (Madisen et al., 2015Madisen L. Garner A.R. Shimaoka D. Chuong A.S. Klapoetke N.C. Li L. van der Bourg A. Niino Y. Egolf L.

Med. 2017; 23: 1488-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For example, we found that endocardial cells in the trabecular myocardium were labeled mainly by Npr3-2A-DreER but not by Apln-DreER, while FABP4+ coronary endothelial cells in the compact myocardium were traced mainly by Apln-DreER but not by Npr3-2A-DreER (Figure 1C, first two images), consistent with previous fate mapping results on the basis of Npr3-CreER and Apln-CreER drivers (Zhang et al., 2016Zhang H. Pu W. Li G. Huang X. He L. Tian X. Liu Q. Zhang L. Wu S.M. Sucov H.M. Zhou B. Endocardium minimally contributes to coronary endothelium in the embryonic ventricular free walls.Circ.

Zhang Z. et al.Subepicardial endothelial cells invade the embryonic ventricle wall to form coronary arteries.Cell Res. 2013; 23: 1075-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Similarly, we generated Dre or DreER drivers on the basis of different promoters, such as Sox9, Prox1, K14, Cela1, Myh11, SMA, Cdh1, Lyz1, Plin1, Ly6g, Sca1, Hopx, P63, and K5, and crossed these lines with Dre-responding ZsGreen or tdTomato reporters. After sectioning of the relevant tissues, we performed immunostaining for ZsGreen or tdTomato along with cell lineage markers for each tissue, and we found that most of the drivers exhibited high specificity for targeting the expected cell lineage (Figure 1C). In addition to the Dre and DreER drivers, we also generated some Cre-induced Dre drivers that contained a Stop cassette flanked by two loxP sites (LSL) upstream of the Dre allele (Figure S1A). The strategy of placing LSL before Dre for Cre induction was recently reported to be useful in detecting transient gene activity in specific cell lineages in vivo, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT)-related gene activity during tumor growth and metastasis (Li et al., 2020Li Y. Lv Z. Zhang S. Wang Z. He L. Tang M. Pu W. Zhao H. Zhang Z. Shi Q. et al.Genetic fate mapping of transient cell fate reveals N-cadherin activity and function in tumor metastasis.Dev. Cell. 2020; 54: 593-607.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We therefore included additional Cre-responsive Dre drivers such as Twist, Zeb1, Snai1, Sma, Pdgfrb, TP63, Krt5, and Cx40-LSL-Dre lines in the Dre tool resource (Figure S1B). We then tested the Twist-LSL-Dre or Zeb1-LSL-Dre lines in combination with a Kit-CreER driver (Figure S1C) and found that we could successfully fate map their transient gene activity in mammary epithelial cells during tumor growth (Figures S1D–S1J) using MMTV-PyMT mouse model (Guy et al., 1992Guy C.T. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Induction of mammary tumors by expression of polyomavirus middle T oncogene: a transgenic mouse model for metastatic disease.Molecular and Cellular Biology. 1992; 12: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). The information for all these Dre, DreER, and LSL-Dre knockin lines appears in Table S1, listing mouse line name, gene targeting strategies, targeting tissues or cell lineages, and available stock number deposited in Shanghai Model Organism company mouse database (https://www.modelorg.com/en/). Genotyping PCR primers were provided in Table S2. With the full suite of new genetic drivers in place, we wanted to begin to use a few of them to resolve some unsettled issues in the stem cell field. In particular, over the past decade there has been an intense debate regarding whether pericytes or adventitial fibroblasts behave as in vivo mesenchymal stem cells. PDGFRa is a marker used for perivascular adventitial cells or fibroblasts, and by examining heart and adipose tissue sections collected from Pdgfra-DreER;R26-rox-Stop-rox (RSR)-tdT, we found that PDGFRa+ cells were specifically and efficiently labeled (Figure 2A; Figures S2A–S2C). These labeled cells also expressed fibroblast marker FSP1 (Figure S2D). Of note, we also found that Pdgfra-DreER efficiently labels PDGFRa+ cells in other organs or tissues collected from Pdgfra-DreER;R26-RSR-tdT;Pdgfrb-CreER;R26-GFP mice (Figures S2E and S2F), and the various mosaicism is likely due to the different recombination efficiencies by tamoxifen. PDGFRb is a marker reported to be expressed in pericytes and by examining heart and adipose tissue sections from Pdgfrb-CreER;R26-GFP, we found that PDGFRb+ cells were also specifically and efficiently labeled (Figure 2B; Figures S2G–S2I). These labeled cells also expressed pericyte marker NG2 (Figure S2J). Lineage-tracing studies based on individual traditional markers for fibroblasts or pericytes may have unintentionally traced a subset of cells that express both of these markers, therefore confounding the interpretation of the fate mapping results. Taking advantage of Dre drivers in combination with Cre lines, we developed an intersectional genetic approach to labeling three populations of perivascular cells simultaneously in vivo: PDGFRa+, PDGFRb+, and PDGFRa+PDGFRb+ cells (Figure 2C). We performed immunostaining for tdT, GFP, and DAPI, on multiple tissue sections from Pdgfra-DreER;R26-RSR-tdT;Pdgfrb-CreER;R26-GFP mice treated with Tam 2 days before tissue collection (Figure 2C). For a brief period after Tam treatment (≤48 h), the tdT or GFP labeling represented PDGFRa and PDGFRb expression in those labeled cells, most of which were found close to vascular endothelial cells in examined organs and tissues (Figures 2D–2R). We found that tdT+ and GFP+ cells were largely two distinct cell populations in most organs or tissues (Figures 2D–2R). A subset of fluorescent cells did express both tdT and GFP, indicating PDGFRa+PDGFRb+ cells in the perivascular niche (Figures 2D–2R). For example, ∼15% of all labeled perivascular cells expressed both tdT and GFP in the brain and heart, and ∼10% in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) or white adipose tissue (WAT), while the majority of labeled cells express either tdT or GFP alone in these tissues (Figure 2S). Quantification data of all examined tissues revealed that different percentages of labeled cells were tdT+GFP+ (Figure 2S). For example, we detected tdT+GFP+ cells in the adventitia (outermost layer) of the aorta (Figure 2H), consistent with results from a previous study based on PDGFRa and PDGFRb antibody staining of the aortic wall (Cattaneo et al., 2020Cattaneo P. Mukherjee D. Spinozzi S. Zhang L. Larcher V. Stallcup W.B. Kataoka H. Chen J. Dimmeler S. Evans S.M. Guimarães-Camboa N. Parallel lineage-tracing studies establish fibroblasts as the prevailing in vivo adipocyte progenitor.Cell Rep. 2020; 30: 571-582.e2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, this intersectional genetic approach enables simultaneous genetic tracing of three molecularly distinct cell populations in vivo, namely, PDGFRa+, PDGFRa+PDGFRb+, and PDGFRb+ perivascular cells. Having established the genetic labeling of perivascular cell populations, we next exposed mice to cold conditions to induce the beiging of adipocytes in the WAT, which has been reported to occur at least partly through de novo differentiation from perivascular adipocyte progenitors (Wang et al., 2013Wang Q.A. Tao C. Gupta R.K. Scherer P.E. Tracking adipogenesis during white adipose tissue development, expansion and regeneration.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1338-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). By combining such stimulation with our intersectional genetic fate mapping strategy, we aimed to determine whether, and to what extent, perivascular progenitor cells contribute to new adipocytes in inguinal WAT (ingWAT) after cold exposure (Figure 3A). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of ingWAT sections revealed a striking change in adipocyte morphology over the course of the 2-week cold challenge, with a vast increase in beige cell-like structures (Figure 3B). Quantification of immunostained sections revealed that the percentage of PDGFRa+ cells expressing tdT did not change significantly among the mice kept at room temperature or at 6°C for 1 or 2 weeks (Figure 3C). Additionally, the GFP labeling percentage of PDGFRb+ cells were statistically similar among these groups (Figure 3C), suggesting that the abundance of differentially labeled cell populations does not appear to be significantly regulated by cold exposure in our models. We next examined the contribution of different perivascular cell populations to adipocytes in mice kept at room temperature and those kept at 6°C for 1 or 2 weeks. By immunostaining for tdT, GFP, and the adipocyte marker PLIN1 on ingWAT sections, we found that most of the tdT+, GFP+, or tdT+GFP+ perivascular cells did not express PLIN1 in mice housed at room temperature (Figure 3D). Except for rare tdT+ adipocytes indicative of a PDGFRa+ cell origin, we did not detect any appreciable GFP+ or GFP+tdT+ adipocytes in ingWAT at room temperature (Figure 3E). In the groups of mice exposed to cold"

Results suggest necessity of mental health support during this pandemic similar to other disasters."
https://openalex.org/W3128002780,"In contrast to nearly all other tissues, the anatomy of cell differentiation in the bone marrow remains unknown. This is owing to a lack of strategies for examining myelopoiesis-the differentiation of myeloid progenitors into a large variety of innate immune cells-in situ in the bone marrow. Such strategies are required to understand differentiation and lineage-commitment decisions, and to define how spatial organizing cues inform tissue function. Here we develop approaches for imaging myelopoiesis in mice, and generate atlases showing the differentiation of granulocytes, monocytes and dendritic cells. The generation of granulocytes and dendritic cells-monocytes localizes to different blood-vessel structures known as sinusoids, and displays lineage-specific spatial and clonal architectures. Acute systemic infection with Listeria monocytogenes induces lineage-specific progenitor clusters to undergo increased self-renewal of progenitors, but the different lineages remain spatially separated. Monocyte-dendritic cell progenitors (MDPs) map with nonclassical monocytes and conventional dendritic cells; these localize to a subset of blood vessels expressing a major regulator of myelopoiesis, colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1, also known as M-CSF)1. Specific deletion of Csf1 in endothelium disrupts the architecture around MDPs and their localization to sinusoids. Subsequently, there are fewer MDPs and their ability to differentiate is reduced, leading to a loss of nonclassical monocytes and dendritic cells during both homeostasis and infection. These data indicate that local cues produced by distinct blood vessels are responsible for the spatial organization of definitive blood cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3126984074,"Ligand-gated ion channels mediate signal transduction at chemical synapses and transition between resting, open, and desensitized states in response to neurotransmitter binding. Neurotransmitters that produce maximum open channel probabilities (Po) are full agonists, whereas those that yield lower than maximum Po are partial agonists. Cys-loop receptors are an important class of neurotransmitter receptors, yet a structure-based understanding of the mechanism of partial agonist action has proven elusive. Here, we study the glycine receptor with the full agonist glycine and the partial agonists taurine and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA). We use electrophysiology to show how partial agonists populate agonist-bound, closed channel states and cryo-EM reconstructions to illuminate the structures of intermediate, pre-open states, providing insights into previously unseen conformational states along the receptor reaction pathway. We further correlate agonist-induced conformational changes to Po across members of the receptor family, providing a hypothetical mechanism for partial and full agonist action at Cys-loop receptors."
https://openalex.org/W3127005349,"To build a universal quantum computer from fragile physical qubits, effective implementation of quantum error correction (QEC) is an essential requirement and a central challenge. Existing demonstrations of QEC are based on a schedule of discrete error syndrome measurements and adaptive recovery operations. These active routines are hardware intensive, prone to introducing and propagating errors, and expected to consume a vast majority of the processing power in a large-scale quantum computer. In principle, QEC can be realized autonomously and continuously by tailoring dissipation within the quantum system, but this strategy has remained challenging so far. Here we encode a logical qubit in Schr\""odinger cat-like multiphoton states of a superconducting cavity, and demonstrate a corrective dissipation process that directly stabilizes an error syndrome operator: the photon number parity. Implemented with continuous-wave control fields only, this passive protocol realizes autonomous correction against single-photon loss and boosts the coherence time of the multiphoton qubit by over a factor of two. Notably, QEC is realized in a modest hardware setup with neither high-fidelity readout nor fast digital feedback, in contrast to the technological sophistication required for prior QEC demonstrations. Compatible with other error suppression and phase stabilization techniques, our experiment suggests reservoir engineering as a resource-efficient alternative or supplement to active QEC in future quantum computing architectures."

A role for theta oscillations in spatial navigation is supported by half a century of research reporting that theta frequency encodes running speed linearly so that displacement can be estimated through theta frequency integration. We show that this relationship is an artifact caused by the fact that the speed of freely moving animals could not be systematically disentangled from acceleration. Using an experimental procedure that clamps running speed at pre-set values, we find that the theta frequency of local field potentials and spike activity is linearly related to positive acceleration, but not negative acceleration or speed. The modulation by positive-only acceleration makes rhythmic activity at theta frequency unfit as a code to compute displacement or any other kinematic variable.

Local field potential (LFP) oscillations provide clues to understanding the dynamics of large populations of neurons. In the hippocampus and associated areas of the rodent brain, one of the most prominent LFP oscillations occurs in the theta frequency band, between 6 and 12 Hz (Buzsáki et al., 1983Buzsáki G.

Theta oscillations, which are especially robust when animals are actively navigating, are thought to reflect synchronization across neural populations. They are believed to result from the interplay between a driving force originating in the medial septum and acting as an external pattern generator, and the internal dynamics provided by local networks tuned to resonate inside this frequency band (Buzsáki, 2002Buzsáki G.

Because of its salience in the hippocampus, the theta rhythm has long been thought to be essential for memory and navigation (Buzsáki and Moser, 2013Buzsáki G. Moser E.I.

In agreement with this, lesion or inactivation of the medial septum in rats causes both suppression of hippocampal theta oscillations and impairment in a number of spatial memory tasks (Brioni et al., 1990Brioni J.D.

In navigating rodents, evidence has pointed to a relationship between theta oscillations and moment-to-moment changes in the animal’s locomotion (Buzsáki et al., 1983Buzsáki G. Leung L.W. Vanderwolf C.H. Cellular bases of hippocampal EEG in the behaving rat.Brain Res. 1983; 287: 139-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The amplitude or power of theta oscillations has been associated with kinematic variables such as the running speed (Whishaw and Vanderwolf, 1973Whishaw I.Q. Vanderwolf C.H.

Similarly, decades of evidence has reported a strong linear relationship between the frequency of theta oscillations and running speed, potentially enabling distance of movement to be read out by integration of theta frequency (Bland and Vanderwolf, 1972Bland B.H.

Although theta amplitude is a local variable, in the sense that it shows strong variations across neighboring recording sites in the hippocampus (Montgomery et al., 2009Montgomery S.M. Betancur M.I. Buzsáki G. Behavior-dependent coordination of multiple theta dipoles in the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 1381-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), theta frequency is strikingly stable between neighboring sites, across hippocampal subfields, and along the dorso-ventral axis of the hippocampus (Patel et al., 2012Patel J.

Traveling theta waves along the entire septotemporal axis of the hippocampus.Neuron. 2012; 75: 410-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), as expected from a wave traveling in an unpartitioned medium (Lubenov and Siapas, 2009Lubenov E.V. Siapas A.G. Hippocampal theta oscillations are travelling waves.Nature. 2009; 459: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This points to theta frequency as a global variable and an important element of the circuit implementation of theta oscillations. Recording LFP and single-cell activity in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus in behaving rats, we sought to determine how theta frequency varies with the kinetics of behavior. In the majority of past studies where a linear relationship between theta frequency and running speed was reported, the frequency of theta oscillations was studied under conditions in which speed and acceleration changed simultaneously (Bland and Vanderwolf, 1972Bland B.H.

This can lead to conflation of the relationship of theta to the two variables. During spontaneous behavior, rats exhibit a concatenation of brief speed peaks, each triggered by a positive acceleration peak and succeeded by a negative acceleration trough, often all within less than a second. Because changes in theta frequency during spontaneous speed peaks could reflect changes in either variable, we recorded theta activity in a bottomless car task (Kropff et al., 2015Kropff E. Carmichael J.E. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Speed cells in the medial entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2015; 523: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), in which the speed profile of rats running along a linear track can be decided by the experimenter. Speed and acceleration were disentangled by training rats to run for several seconds at constant speed, with acceleration close to zero, and with pre-determined acceleration or deceleration events between successive constant-speed segments. Data within uniform motion segments with zero acceleration were used to study the role of speed in modulating theta frequency, while the role of acceleration was assessed from the temporally precise and repeatable transitions between speed levels. In order to disentangle the contribution of speed and acceleration to modulation of theta frequency, we trained rats to run within a rat-sized computer-driven frame that moves along a 4-m linear track at an experimenter-controlled speed (Figure 1A) (Kropff et al., 2015Kropff E. Carmichael J.E. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Speed cells in the medial entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2015; 523: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Because this “bottomless car” has no floor, rats need to actively run following the pre-set speed profile to reach the end of the track, where they get a chocolate cereal reward. Speed was kept constant within segments of the track so that accelerations only took place at transitions between segments with different speed. LFP and single unit activity were recorded from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and the hippocampus during performance of this task. Data were also collected from these regions during free foraging sessions in a 1-m wide square enclosure. In both tasks, instantaneous speed and acceleration were estimated from the position tracking signal, while instantaneous theta frequency was obtained from the Hilbert transform of the band-passed LFP (STAR methods). Given that theta frequency is not a local variable (Lubenov and Siapas, 2009Lubenov E.V. Siapas A.G.

First, 3 rats were trained to run at a high speed on one half of the car track and at a low speed on the other half, with sudden transitions between the two levels (two-speed step protocol). These transitions, lasting around 500 ms, represented isolated acceleration episodes (Figure 1B for transitions between 6 cm s−1 and 36 cm s−1, averaged over 544 repetitions; Figure S1A for transitions with smaller speed steps; transitions from resting state to running are not shown or analyzed in order to exclude potential effects related to states of arousal, although these were qualitatively similar to transitions between uniform motion segments). Positive acceleration peaks, surrounded by periods of slow and fast uniform motion with near-zero acceleration, were mirrored by theta-frequency peaks with largely similar dynamics, in both hippocampus and MEC (Figure 1B, top). The similarity in time course was particularly precise during the rising phase of the acceleration peak, whereas the decay was slightly slower for theta frequency than acceleration (Figures S1A–S1D). In striking contrast, opposite negative acceleration troughs, during transitions from fast to slow running speeds, had no influence on theta frequency (Figure 1B, bottom), nor did running at different constant speeds before and after each acceleration event (Figure 1B, t < 0 s or t > 1 s). To rule out the possibility that the relationship between theta frequency and acceleration was an artifact related to the method used to estimate instantaneous theta frequency, we studied 1-s raw LFP windows cut around the onset of each event, grouped by similarity and averaged (STAR methods). Faster oscillations during positive acceleration were directly observable from these group averages (Figures 1C and S1E). A similar enhancement of theta frequency was observed at the level of individual acceleration episodes, with minimal variation in time course from episode to episode (Figure S1F). The effect was also observable in average spectrograms based on the fast Fourier transform (Figure S1G). To determine whether theta frequency increases linearly with acceleration, we next analyzed acceleration segments in a protocol with four speed levels (8 rats, 174 sessions). Speed was pseudo-randomly alternated between 7, 14, 21, and 28 cm s−1 to produce 16 possible step-like transitions, grouped in 7 levels of mean acceleration (0, ±7, ±14, and ±21 cm s−2) (Figure 1D; see STAR methods for full description of the protocol). As expected from the two-speed experiment, theta frequency in MEC was consistently above the 99th percentile of the uniform motion distribution only during positive acceleration events. Entorhinal theta frequency, averaged between 60 and 260 ms after the onset of each event (black area), correlated significantly with acceleration level across the pool of all events (7 levels of acceleration; Pearson correlation: r = 0.31, two-tailed t test of H0: r = 0, t(8,026) = 29, p: 10−175) (Figures 1E, 1F, and S2). This correlation was significant for positive, but not negative, acceleration events considered separately (respective Pearson correlations: r = 0.24, t(3,387) = 14.6, p: 10−46 and r = 0.01, t(3,331) = 0.8, p: 0.42). A regression analysis testing for a non-linear dependence on acceleration including up to cubic polynomials revealed that the dependence of theta frequency on acceleration (≥0 cm s−2) was linear (H0: no linear contribution, t(4,691) = 3.2; p: 0.001), with no significant contribution of higher order terms (H0: no quadratic contribution, t(4,691) = 0.08; p: 0.94; H0: no cubic contribution, t(4,691) = −0.07; p: 0.94). A similar correlation between theta frequency and positive, but not negative, acceleration was obtained for LFP in the hippocampus (91 sessions) (Figure S2). Theta frequency was not modulated by speed during acceleration events (MEC: r = 0.01, t(8,026) = 1.0, p: 0.33; hippocampus: r = 0.00, t(3,662) = 0.0, p: 0.84) or during uniform motion segments (MEC: r = 0.02, t(7,909) = 1.7, p: 0.10; hippocampus: r = −0.03, t(3,523) = −1.5, p: 0.13) (Figure 1G). We next asked whether the linear increase in theta frequency with positive acceleration was present not only in LFP signals but also in the rhythmic spiking activity of individual neurons. We first examined spike-lag histograms (Climer et al., 2015Climer J.R. DiTullio R. Newman E.L. Hasselmo M.E. Eden U.T. Examination of rhythmicity of extracellularly recorded neurons in the entorhinal cortex.Hippocampus. 2015; 25: 460-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) of the cumulative activity of 167 MEC neurons recorded in the two-speed step protocol (Figure 1B) and constructed exclusively with data from windows of 500 ms after each acceleration or deceleration onset (Figure 2A; window size optimized for spike-lag analysis). We fitted each curve with a decaying oscillatory function, obtaining intrinsic firing frequency within the theta band as one of the fitting parameters (Figure S2D). We also shuffled the windows 1,000 times (see example in Figure 2A) so they would randomly fall into slow or fast uniform motion periods with equal probability. Fitted intrinsic frequency was not different from the shuffled distribution during deceleration episodes (Figure 2B; deceleration, black line: 7.97 Hz, right-tail p: 0.39 by comparison with 1,000 shuffles) but increased significantly during positive acceleration episodes (red line: 9.25 Hz, p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained for hippocampal neurons (Figure S2E). When applying these analyses to uniform motion episodes we found that, unlike LFP, intrinsic theta frequency exhibited a small but significant modulation by speed (Figure 2C; fast: 7.91 Hz, slow: 7.64 Hz, respectively higher and lower than any values for 1,000 shuffles of speed tags, p < 0.001). The modulation by speed was only one-fifth in size of the modulation by acceleration for the same neurons in the same experimental sessions (0.27 Hz difference between speed groups in Figure 2C versus 1.28 Hz difference between acceleration groups in Figure 2B). Similar analyses applied to data from the four-speed step protocol (Figure S3) and the open field (Figure S4) showed that the speed modulation of rhythmic spiking activity was consistent with theta phase precession: It was restricted to a subset of cell types, absent in grid cells that did not exhibit phase precession, and for the pool of all grid cells, 98% of the variance of intrinsic firing period across speed bins was explained by a change in spiking theta phase. Together, these results suggest that positive acceleration strongly modulates the frequency of rhythmic spiking in the theta band, whereas spatial coding, through phase precession, adds an independent and rather mild source of modulation by speed. To rule out the possibility that the effects of acceleration reflect exclusive features of the bottomless-car procedure, we next determined the relationship between theta frequency and instantaneous acceleration in pooled data from 17 rats foraging freely in a 1-m wide square enclosure. Unlike for the car data, where stereotypical behavior allowed for averaging over many identical trials, the spontaneous open field data were smoothed along the temporal domain in order to obtain reliable one-shot instantaneous estimations of speed, acceleration, and theta frequency, whereas episodes of resting, grooming, and other non-navigational behaviors were removed (Figure S5; STAR methods). Because velocity and acceleration are vectors with direction and magnitude in the 2D condition, we plotted theta frequency as a function of the acceleration vector in polar coordinates, where the radial axis corresponds to the acceleration magnitude a and the angular axis to its direction relative to that of the velocity vector (θav) (Figure 3A; north corresponds to θav = 0°). Acceleration describes all changes in the velocity vector, both in its magnitude or its direction. Because we were specifically interested in variations in the magnitude (speeding up or slowing down), we defined the linear acceleration as a∗sign(cos(θav)) only for timestamps in which cos(θav) was either >0.9 (positive acceleration; north) or <−0.9 (negative acceleration; south), and used this definition for all analyses in the 2D open-field condition. When we plotted LFP theta frequency as a function of vector (Figure 3A) or linear (Figure 3B) acceleration in the open field, an asymmetrical relationship similar to the one obtained in the car experiments (Figure 1F) was observed. This occurred irrespective of whether movements were parallel or perpendicular to the head direction (Figure 3C). However, in contrast with results from the bottomless car, a small increase in theta frequency for negative acceleration was also observed. This effect is related to the slow decaying dynamics of theta frequency (Figure S1) and will be analyzed below. To determine whether acceleration modulated also the rhythmicity of spiking in individual neurons during spontaneous behavior, we performed analyses similar to those used for the car data (Figures 2A and 2B) but selecting windows of high positive or negative linear acceleration (>50 cm s−2; variable window length, see STAR methods). We found a substantial increase in intrinsic frequency relative to shuffled data (1,000 shuffles of window timestamps) during positive acceleration (8.77 Hz versus a shuffle mean of 8.02 Hz, right-tail p < 0.001 obtained by direct comparison with the shuffled distribution), but not when acceleration was negative (8.06 Hz versus 8.03 Hz, p: 0.1) (Figures 3D and 3E). Similar observations were made when entorhinal and hippocampal functional cell types—grid cells, head direction cells, speed cells, border cells, place cells, and putative interneurons—were analyzed separately (Figure 3F; positive acceleration range: 8.33–8.93 Hz, p against shuffled window timestamps <0.001 for all functional cell types; negative acceleration range: 7.81–8.42 Hz, p > 0.04 for all cell types, Bonferroni adjusted alpha: 0.05/8 = 0.006). In a final set of experiments, we explored whether modulation of LFP theta frequency by acceleration depends on specific self-motion feedback signals. In these experiments, rats ran inside the bottomless car in the absence of visual input and optic flow (dark condition) or proprioceptive ambulatory feedback (passive transport on platform) (STAR methods). Both conditions led to acceleration modulation of theta frequency in MEC similar to the effect observed in regular car experiments, in step protocols with two speeds (Figures 4A and S6A–S6C; 3 rats) or four speeds (Figures 4B and S6D; pooled data from 7 rats). Grid cells remapped during both conditions (Figures 4C and 4D). The new maps in the dark and passive transport conditions had low spatial information and stability, which resulted in poor decoding of rat position (Figures 4E and S6E). These observations suggest that although the spatial firing pattern of grid cells on the car relies on both visual and proprioceptive ambulatory feedback signals, as expected (Campbell et al., 2018Campbell M.G.

The results complement the dissociation between theta frequency and spatial representation through phase precession in MEC (Figures S3 and S4). Our car experiments show that when speed and acceleration are carefully disentangled, there is no speed modulation of theta frequency. However, such a modulation has been reported in a number of thoroughly conducted experiments, sharing a common spontaneous behavior framework (Bland and Vanderwolf, 1972Bland B.H. Vanderwolf C.H.

https://openalex.org/W3128829971,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can be important components in gene-regulatory networks1, but the exact nature and extent of their involvement in human Mendelian disease is largely unknown. Here we show that genetic ablation of a lncRNA locus on human chromosome 2 causes a severe congenital limb malformation. We identified homozygous 27-63-kilobase deletions located 300 kilobases upstream of the engrailed-1 gene (EN1) in patients with a complex limb malformation featuring mesomelic shortening, syndactyly and ventral nails (dorsal dimelia). Re-engineering of the human deletions in mice resulted in a complete loss of En1 expression in the limb and a double dorsal-limb phenotype that recapitulates the human disease phenotype. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis in the developing mouse limb revealed a four-exon-long non-coding transcript within the deleted region, which we named Maenli. Functional dissection of the Maenli locus showed that its transcriptional activity is required for limb-specific En1 activation in cis, thereby fine-tuning the gene-regulatory networks controlling dorso-ventral polarity in the developing limb bud. Its loss results in the En1-related dorsal ventral limb phenotype, a subset of the full En1-associated phenotype. Our findings demonstrate that mutations involving lncRNA loci can result in human Mendelian disease."

This is also due to the fact, that there has been no reliable data available on aerosol emissions from adolescents speaking, singing, and shouting. By utilizing a laser particle counter in cleanroom conditions we show, that adolescents emit fewer aerosol particles during singing than what has been known so far for adults. In our data, the emission rates ranged from 16 P/s to 267 P/s for speaking, 141 P/s to 1240 P/s for singing, and 683 P/s to 4332 P/s for shouting. The data advocate an adaptation of existing risk management strategies and rules of conduct for groups of singing adolescents, like gatherings in an educational context, e.g. singing lessons or choir rehearsals."
https://openalex.org/W3126720462,"The atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) has been in decline since the production of ozone-depleting substances was phased out under the Montreal Protocol1,2. Since 2013, the concentration decline of CFC-11 slowed unexpectedly owing to increasing emissions, probably from unreported production, which, if sustained, would delay the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Here we report an accelerated decline in the global mean CFC-11 concentration during 2019 and 2020, derived from atmospheric concentration measurements at remote sites around the world. We find that global CFC-11 emissions decreased by 18 ± 6 gigagrams per year (26 ± 9 per cent; one standard deviation) from 2018 to 2019, to a 2019 value (52 ± 10 gigagrams per year) that is similar to the 2008−2012 mean. The decline in global emissions suggests a substantial decrease in unreported CFC-11 production. If the sharp decline in unexpected global emissions and unreported production is sustained, any associated future ozone depletion is likely to be limited, despite an increase in the CFC-11 bank (the amount of CFC-11 produced, but not yet emitted) by 90 to 725 gigagrams by the beginning of 2020."
https://openalex.org/W3126835538,"Emissions of ozone-depleting substances, including trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), have decreased since the mid-1980s in response to the Montreal Protocol1,2. In recent years, an unexpected increase in CFC-11 emissions beginning in 2013 has been reported, with much of the global rise attributed to emissions from eastern China3,4. Here we use high-frequency atmospheric mole fraction observations from Gosan, South Korea and Hateruma, Japan, together with atmospheric chemical transport-model simulations, to investigate regional CFC-11 emissions from eastern China. We find that CFC-11 emissions returned to pre-2013 levels in 2019 (5.0 ± 1.0 gigagrams per year in 2019, compared to 7.2 ± 1.5 gigagrams per year for 2008–2012, ±1 standard deviation), decreasing by 10 ± 3 gigagrams per year since 2014–2017. Furthermore, we find that in this region, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12) emissions—potentially associated with CFC-11 production—were higher than expected after 2013 and then declined one to two years before the CFC-11 emissions reduction. This suggests that CFC-11 production occurred in eastern China after the mandated global phase-out, and that there was a subsequent decline in production during 2017–2018. We estimate that the amount of the CFC-11 bank (the amount of CFC-11 produced, but not yet emitted) in eastern China is up to 112 gigagrams larger in 2019 compared to pre-2013 levels, probably as a result of recent production. Nevertheless, it seems that any substantial delay in ozone-layer recovery has been avoided, perhaps owing to timely reporting3,4 and subsequent action by industry and government in China5,6. Atmospheric data and chemical-transport modelling show that CFC-11 emissions from eastern China have again decreased, after increasing in 2013–2017, and a delay in ozone-layer recovery has probably been avoided."
https://openalex.org/W3129079068,"Gene expression in higher eukaryotic cells orchestrates interactions between thousands of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and tens of thousands of RNAs1. The kinetics by which RBPs bind to and dissociate from their RNA sites are critical for the coordination of cellular RNA-protein interactions2. However, these kinetic parameters have not been experimentally measured in cells. Here we show that time-resolved RNA-protein cross-linking with a pulsed femtosecond ultraviolet laser, followed by immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing, allows the determination of binding and dissociation kinetics of the RBP DAZL for thousands of individual RNA-binding sites in cells. This kinetic cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (KIN-CLIP) approach reveals that DAZL resides at individual binding sites for time periods of only seconds or shorter, whereas the binding sites remain DAZL-free for markedly longer. The data also indicate that DAZL binds to many RNAs in clusters of multiple proximal sites. The effect of DAZL on mRNA levels and ribosome association correlates with the cumulative probability of DAZL binding in these clusters. Integrating kinetic data with mRNA features quantitatively connects DAZL-RNA binding to DAZL function. Our results show how kinetic parameters for RNA-protein interactions can be measured in cells, and how these data link RBP-RNA binding to the cellular function of RBPs."

A total of 668 adults (64.7% males, M = 28.12 years, SD = 9.09 years) participated in the online survey. The participants were grouped as; yoga practitioners, other spiritual practitioners, and non-practitioners based on their responses to daily practices that they follow. Yoga practitioners were further examined based on the duration of practice as; long-term, mid-term and beginners. Multivariate analysis indicates that yoga practitioners had significantly lower depression, anxiety, &amp; stress (DASS), and higher general wellbeing (SWGB) as well as higher peace of mind (POMS) than the other two groups. The results further revealed that the yoga practitioners significantly differed in the perception of personal control, illness concern and emotional impact of COVID19. However, there was no significant difference found for the measure of resilience (BRS) in this study. Yoga practitioners also significantly differed in the cognitive reappraisal strategy for regulating their emotions than the other two groups. Interestingly, it was found that beginners -those who had started practicing yoga only during the lockdown period reported no significant difference for general wellbeing and peace of mind when compared to the mid- term practitioner. Evidence supports that yoga was found as an effective self- management strategy to cope with stress, anxiety and depression, and maintain wellbeing during COVID19 lockdown."
https://openalex.org/W3126955317,"Introduction Retinal implants have now been approved and commercially available for certain clinical populations for over 5 years, with hundreds of individuals implanted, scores of them closely followed in research trials. Despite these numbers, however, few data are available that would help us answer basic questions regarding the nature and outcomes of artificial vision: what do recipients see when the device is turned on for the first time, and how does that change over time? Methods Semi-structured interviews and observations were undertaken at two sites in France and the UK with 16 recipients who had received either the Argus II or IRIS II devices. Data were collected at various time points in the process that implant recipients went through in receiving and learning to use the device, including initial evaluation, implantation, initial activation and systems fitting, re-education and finally post-education. These data were supplemented with data from interviews conducted with vision rehabilitation specialists at the clinical sites and clinical researchers at the device manufacturers (Second Sight and Pixium Vision). Observational and interview data were transcribed, coded and analyzed using an approach guided by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results Implant recipients described the perceptual experience produced by their epiretinal implants as fundamentally, qualitatively different than natural vision. All used terms that invoked electrical stimuli to describe the appearance of their percepts, yet the characteristics used to describe the percepts varied significantly between recipients. Artificial vision for these recipients was a highly specific, learned skill-set that combined particular bodily techniques, associative learning and deductive reasoning in order to build a “lexicon of flashes”—a distinct perceptual vocabulary that they then used to decompose, recompose and interpret their surroundings. The percept did not transform over time; rather, the recipient became better at interpreting the signals they received, using cognitive techniques. The process of using the device never ceased to be cognitively fatiguing, and did not come without risk or cost to the recipient. In exchange, recipients received hope and purpose through participation, as well as a new kind of sensory signal that may not have afforded practical or functional use in daily life but, for some, provided a kind of “contemplative perception” that recipients tailored to individualized activities. Conclusion Attending to the qualitative reports of implant recipients regarding the experience of artificial vision provides valuable information not captured by extant clinical outcome measures."

https://openalex.org/W3128102838,"Molecular self-assembly is the spontaneous association of simple molecules into larger and ordered structures1. It is the basis of several natural processes, such as the formation of colloids, crystals, proteins, viruses and double-helical DNA2. Molecular self-assembly has inspired strategies for the rational design of materials with specific chemical and physical properties3, and is one of the most important concepts in supramolecular chemistry. Although molecular self-assembly has been extensively investigated, understanding the rules governing this phenomenon remains challenging. Here we report on a simple hydrochloride salt of fampridine that crystallizes as four different structures, two of which adopt unusual self-assemblies consisting of polyhedral clusters of chloride and pyridinium ions. These two structures represent Frank–Kasper (FK) phases of a small and rigid organic molecule. Although discovered in metal alloys4,5 more than 60 years ago, FK phases have recently been observed in several classes of supramolecular soft matter6–11 and in gold nanocrystal superlattices12 and remain the object of recent discoveries13. In these systems, atoms or spherical assemblies of molecules are packed to form polyhedra with coordination numbers 12, 14, 15 or 16. The two FK structures reported here crystallize from a dense liquid phase and show a complexity that is generally not observed in small rigid organic molecules. Investigation of the precursor dense liquid phase by cryogenic electron microscopy reveals the presence of spherical aggregates with sizes ranging between 1.5 and 4.6 nanometres. These structures, together with the experimental procedure used for their preparation, invite interesting speculation about their formation and open different perspectives for the design of organic crystalline materials. Frank–Kasper phases are observed in small organic molecules from the crystallization of fampridine hydrochloride into two distinct structures, indicating that complex self-assembled structures can arise from simple organic salts."
https://openalex.org/W3126881360,"Background Tree-based intercropping (agroforestry) has been advocated to reduce adverse environmental impacts of conventional arable cropping. Modern agroforestry systems in the temperate zone are alley-cropping systems that combine rows of fast-growing trees with rows of arable crops. Soil microbial communities in these systems have been investigated intensively; however, molecular studies with high taxonomical resolution are scarce. Methods Here, we assessed the effect of temperate agroforestry on the abundance, diversity and composition of soil bacterial communities at three paired poplar-based alley cropping and conventional monoculture cropland systems using real-time PCR and Illumina sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Two of the three systems grew summer barley ( Hordeum vulgare ); one system grew maize ( Zea mays ) in the sampling year. To capture the spatial heterogeneity induced by the tree rows, soil samples in the agroforestry systems were collected along transects spanning from the centre of the tree rows to the centre of the agroforestry crop rows. Results Tree rows of temperate agroforestry systems increased the abundance of soil bacteria while their alpha diversity remained largely unaffected. The composition of the bacterial communities in tree rows differed from those in arable land (crop rows of the agroforestry systems and conventional monoculture croplands). Several bacterial groups in soil showed strong association with either tree rows or arable land, revealing that the introduction of trees into arable land through agroforestry is accompanied by the introduction of a tree row-associated microbiome. Conclusion The presence of tree row-associated bacteria in agroforestry increases the overall microbial diversity of the system. We speculate that the increase in biodiversity is accompanied by functional diversification. Differences in plant-derived nutrients (root exudates and tree litter) and management practices (fertilization and tillage) likely account for the differences between bacterial communities of tree rows and arable land in agroforestry systems."
https://openalex.org/W3126840298,"Errors in early embryogenesis are a cause of sporadic cell death and developmental failure1,2. Phagocytic activity has a central role in scavenging apoptotic cells in differentiated tissues3–6. However, how apoptotic cells are cleared in the blastula embryo in the absence of specialized immune cells remains unknown. Here we show that the surface epithelium of zebrafish and mouse embryos, which is the first tissue formed during vertebrate development, performs efficient phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells through phosphatidylserine-mediated target recognition. Quantitative four-dimensional in vivo imaging analyses reveal a collective epithelial clearance mechanism that is based on mechanical cooperation by two types of Rac1-dependent basal epithelial protrusions. The first type of protrusion, phagocytic cups, mediates apoptotic target uptake. The second, a previously undescribed type of fast and extended actin-based protrusion that we call ‘epithelial arms’, promotes the rapid dispersal of apoptotic targets through Arp2/3-dependent mechanical pushing. On the basis of experimental data and modelling, we show that mechanical load-sharing enables the long-range cooperative uptake of apoptotic cells by multiple epithelial cells. This optimizes the efficiency of tissue clearance by extending the limited spatial exploration range and local uptake capacity of non-motile epithelial cells. Our findings show that epithelial tissue clearance facilitates error correction that is relevant to the developmental robustness and survival of the embryo, revealing the presence of an innate immune function in the earliest stages of embryonic development. Mechanical load-sharing enables the long-range cooperative uptake of apoptotic cells by multiple epithelial cells; and clearance of these apoptotic cells facilitates error correction, which is necessary for developmental robustness and survival of the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W3127275541,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontline of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response, yet there is a paucity of literature on their knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) in relation to the pandemic. Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Mozambique are known locally as agentes polivalentes elementares (APEs). While technical guidance surrounding COVID-19 is available to support APEs, communicating this information has been challenging due to restrictions on travel, face-to-face group meetings and training, imposed from May to August 2020. A digital health platform, upSCALE, that already supports 1,213 APEs and 299 supervisors across three provinces, is being used to support APEs on effective COVID-19 management by delivering COVID-19 sensitive SMS messages, training modules and a COVID-19 KAP survey. The KAP survey, conducted from June 2020 to August 2020, consisted of 10 questions. Of 1,065 active upSCALE APEs, 28% completed the survey. Results indicate that only a small proportion of APEs listed the correct COVID-19 symptoms, transmission routes and appropriate prevention measures (n = (25%), n = (16%) and n = (39%), respectively) specifically included in national health education materials. Misconceptions were mainly related to transmission routes, high risk individuals and asymptomatic patients. 84% said they followed all government prevention guidelines. The results from the KAP survey were used to support the rapid development and deployment of targeted COVID-19 awareness and education materials for the APEs. A follow-up KAP survey is planned for November 2020. Adapting the existing upSCALE platform enabled a better understanding, in real time, of the KAP of APEs around COVID-19 management.

https://openalex.org/W3128586333,"Background and purpose Obesity is an established risk factor for ischemic stroke but the association of increased body mass index (BMI) with survival after ischemic stroke remains controversial. Many studies have shown that increased BMI has a “protective” effect on survival after stroke while other studies have debunked the “obesity paradox”. This study aimed at examining the relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality at one year in first-time ischemic stroke patients using a large dataset extracted from different resources including electronic health records. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive ischemic stroke patients captured in our Geisinger NeuroScience Ischemic Stroke (GNSIS) database. Survival in first-time ischemic stroke patients in different BMI categories was analyzed using Kaplan Meier survival curves. The predictors of mortality at one-year were assessed using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. Results Among 6,703 first-time ischemic stroke patients, overweight and obese patients were found to have statistically decreased hazard ratio (HR) compared to the non-overweight patients (overweight patients- HR = 0.61 [95% CI, 0.52–0.72]; obese patients- HR = 0.56 [95% CI, 0.48–0.67]). Predictors with a significant increase in the hazard ratio for one-year mortality were age at the ischemic stroke event, history of neoplasm, atrial fibrillation/flutter, diabetes, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Conclusion Our study results support the obesity paradox in ischemic stroke patients as shown by a significantly decreased hazard ratio for one-year mortality among overweight and obese patients in comparison to non-overweight patients."
https://openalex.org/W3127053141,"Fundamental relationships are believed to exist between the symmetries of building blocks and the condensed matter phases that they form1. For example, constituent molecular and colloidal rods and disks impart their uniaxial symmetry onto nematic liquid crystals, such as those used in displays1,2. Low-symmetry organizations could form in mixtures of rods and disks3-5, but entropy tends to phase-separate them at the molecular and colloidal scales, whereas strong elasticity-mediated interactions drive the formation of chains and crystals in nematic colloids6-11. To have a structure with few or no symmetry operations apart from trivial ones has so far been demonstrated to be a property of solids alone1, but not of their fully fluid condensed matter counterparts, even though such symmetries have been considered theoretically12-15 and observed in magnetic colloids16. Here we show that dispersing highly anisotropic charged colloidal disks in a nematic host composed of molecular rods provides a platform for observing many low-symmetry phases. Depending on the temperature, concentration and surface charge of the disks, we find nematic, smectic and columnar organizations with symmetries ranging from uniaxial1,2 to orthorhombic17-21 and monoclinic12-15. With increasing temperature, we observe unusual transitions from less- to more-ordered states and re-entrant22 phases. Most importantly, we demonstrate the presence of reconfigurable monoclinic colloidal nematic order, as well as the possibility of thermal and magnetic control of low-symmetry self-assembly2,23,24. Our experimental findings are supported by theoretical modelling of the colloidal interactions between disks in the nematic host and may provide a route towards realizing many low-symmetry condensed matter phases in systems with building blocks of dissimilar shapes and sizes, as well as their technological applications."
https://openalex.org/W3128712632,"We present findings from three waves of a population-representative, UK time-use diary survey conducted both pre- and in real time during full ‘lockdown’, and again following the easing of social restrictions. We used an innovative online diary instrument that has proved both reliable and quick-to-field. Combining diary information on activity, location, and co-presence to estimate infection risks associated with daily behavior, we show clear changes in risk-associated behavior between the pre, full-lockdown and post full-lockdown periods. We document a shift from more to less risky daily behavior patterns (combinations of activity/location/co-presence categories) between the pre-pandemic pattern and full lockdown in May/June 2020, followed by a reversion (although not a complete reversal) of those patterns in August 2020 following the end of the first lockdown. Because, in general, a populations’ time use changes relatively slowly, the behavioral changes revealed may be interpreted as a consequence of the UK COVID-19 lockdown social restrictions and their subsequent relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W3128311518,"Bone is a dynamic tissue that constantly adapts to changing mechanical demands. The transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway plays several important roles in maintaining skeletal homeostasis by both coupling the bone-forming and bone-resorbing activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts and by playing a causal role in the anabolic response of bone to applied loads. However, the extent to which the TGFβ signaling pathway in osteocytes is directly regulated by fluid shear stress (FSS) is unknown, despite work suggesting that fluid flow along canaliculi is a dominant physical cue sensed by osteocytes following bone compression. To investigate the effects of FSS on TGFβ signaling in osteocytes, we stimulated osteocytic OCY454 cells cultured within a microfluidic platform with FSS. We find that FSS rapidly upregulates Smad2/3 phosphorylation and TGFβ target gene expression, even in the absence of added TGFβ. Indeed, relative to treatment with TGFβ, FSS induced a larger increase in levels of pSmad2/3 and Serpine1 that persisted even in the presence of a TGFβ receptor type I inhibitor. Our results show that FSS stimulation rapidly induces phosphorylation of multiple TGFβ family R-Smads by stimulating multimerization and concurrently activating several TGFβ and BMP type I receptors, in a manner that requires the activity of the corresponding ligand. While the individual roles of the TGFβ and BMP signaling pathways in bone mechanotransduction remain unclear, these results implicate that FSS activates both pathways to generate a downstream response that differs from that achieved by either ligand alone."
https://openalex.org/W3128610444,"UV irradiation can injure the epidermis, resulting in sunburn, inflammation, and cutaneous tissue disorders. Previous studies demonstrate that EGFR in keratinocytes can be activated by UVB and contributes to inflammation. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a nuclear enzyme and plays an essential role in DNA repair under moderate stress. In this study, we set out to understand how PARP-1 regulates UVB irradiation-induced skin injury and interplays with EGFR to mediate the inflammation response. We found that PARP-1 deficiency exacerbated the UVB-induced inflammation, water loss, and back skin damage in mice. In human primary keratinocytes, UVB can activate PARP-1 and enhance DNA damage upon PARP-1 gene silencing. Moreover, PARP-1 silencing and PARP inhibitor olaparib can suppress UVB-induced COX-2 and MMP-1 expression, but enhance TNF-α and IL-8 expression. In addition, EGFR silencing or EGFR inhibition by gefitinib can decrease UVB-induced COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-8 expression, suggesting EGFR activation via paracrine action can mediate UVB-induced inflammation responses. Immunoblotting data revealed that PARP-1 inhibition decreases UVB-induced EGFR and p38 activation. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 also dramatically led to the attenuation of UVB-induced inflammatory gene expression. Of note, genetic ablation of PARP-1 or EGFR can attenuate UVB-induced ROS production, and antioxidant NAC can attenuate UVB-induced EGFR-p38 signaling axis and PARP-1 activation. These data suggest the regulatory loops among EGFR, PARP-1, and ROS upon UVB stress. PARP-1 not only serves DNA repair function but also orchestrates interactions to EGFR transactivation and ROS production, leading to p38 signaling for inflammatory gene expression in keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3126293298,"Background Left atrial (LA) strain is associated with symptomatic status and atrial fibrillation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, hemodynamic determinants of LA reservoir (LARS), conduit, and pump strains have not been examined and data are needed on the relation of LA strain with exercise tolerance in HCM. Methods Fifty HCM patients with echocardiographic and CMR imaging within 30 days were included. Left ventricular (LV) volumes, mass, EF, scar extent, extracellular volume fraction (ECV), and LA maximum volume were measured by CMR. Echo studies were analyzed for mitral inflow, pulmonary vein flow, mitral annulus tissue Doppler velocities, LV global longitudinal strain, and LA strain. Twenty six patients able and willing to exercise underwent cardiopulmonary stress testing for peak oxygen consumption (MVO2), and V E /V CO2 slope. Patients were followed for clinical events. Findings LARS was significantly associated with indices of LA systolic function, LV GLS, and LV filling pressures (P&lt;0.05). Conduit strain was significantly associated with mitral annulus early diastolic velocity and ECV, whereas LA pump strain was determined by LA systolic function and indices of LV end diastolic pressure (all P&lt;0.05). LARS and conduit strain were significantly higher in patients who achieved ≥80% of MVO 2 . LARS, conduit, and pump strains were significantly associated with atrial fibrillation (P&lt;0.05). Conclusions LV structure, systolic and diastolic function, and LA systolic function determine the 3 components of LA strain. LA strain is associated with exercise tolerance and clinical events in patients with HCM."
https://openalex.org/W3127476705,"Background To evaluate whether patients with scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD) have early Parkinson’s disease (PD). Methods The clinical characteristics, striatal specific binding ratios (SBRs), and the indices of I-123 FP-CIT SPECT images of 50 SWEDD patients, 304 PD patients, and 141 healthy controls were acquired from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data and evaluated during a 2-year clinical follow-up period. Results Of the 50 subjects with SWEDD, PD was confirmed in 13 subjects (the PD-SWEDD group), while the remaining 37 subjects had other diseases (the Other-SWEDD group). Striatal SBR values and striatal asymmetry indices of the PD group were significantly different with those of the PD-SWEDD and Other-SWEDD groups at both baseline and after 2 years ( p &lt; 0.001). Putaminal SBR values of the PD-SWEDD group were significantly decreased after 2 years ( p &lt; 0.05). There was no difference of the SBR values between baseline and after 2 years in the Other-SWEDD group. A baseline MDS-UPDRS III score matched comparison of the PD and PD-SWEDD group was done due to the large difference of the subject numbers. Striatal SBR values and striatal asymmetry indices were significantly different ( p &lt; 0.001) between the two groups at both baseline and after 2 years, but there were no significant difference with respect to the MDS-UPDRS III scores after 2 years between the two groups. Conclusion The different SBR values and asymmetry indices between the PD and PD-SWEDD groups at baseline and after 2 years indicate that SWEDD may not be early PD, but rather a different disease entity."

To address flexible PAM specificities, AsCas12a mutants (RR variant [S542R/K607R] and RVR variants [S542R/K548V/N552R]) have been identified, which recognize 5′-TYCV-3′ (Y: T/C; V: A/C/G) and 5′-TATV-3′ as PAM, respectively (21Gao L.

Specifically, the RR variant recognizes 5′-TWTV-3′ (W: A/T, V: A/C/G) as PAM, whereas 5′-TYYV-3′ (Y: C/T, V: A/C/G) serves as the PAM for the RVR variant (22Toth E. Czene B.C. Kulcsar P.I.

FnCas12a recognizes 5′-KYTV-3′ (K: T/G; Y: C/T; V: A/C/G) as PAM in human cells (20Tu M. Lin L. Cheng Y. He X. Sun H. Xie H. Fu J. Liu C. Li J. Chen D. Xi H. Xue D. Liu Q. Zhao J.

According to our previous study, FnCas12a has low activity or almost no activity at certain target sites (20Tu M. Lin L. Cheng Y. He X. Sun H. Xie H. Fu J. Liu C. Li J. Chen D. Xi H. Xue D. Liu Q.

Theoretically, engineering of the coding sequence of FnCas12a may modulate the corresponding genome editing activity. Here, we sought to engineer and identify FnCas12a variants with high activity. Based on an assay (20Tu M. Lin L. Cheng Y. He X. Sun H. Xie H. Fu J. Liu C. Li J. Chen D. Xi H. Xue D. Liu Q. Zhao J. Gao C. et al.A 'new lease of life': FnCpf1 possesses DNA cleavage activity for genome editing in human cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 11295-11304Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we generated the plasmid (pJET-U6-crRNA) and co-transfected it with FnCas12a in 293-SC1 cells (HEK-293 cells harboring the EGFP expression cassette), targeting EGFP sites A (also named with site 5, based on the location of target sequences in EGFP) and B (also named with site 44) (Table S1). The results revealed that we efficiently induced insertion or deletion mutations (indels) in EGFP (Fig. S1, A and B). Thus, the human cell-based EGFP reporter system may be adopted to quantitatively assess the activity of FnCas12a variants through flow cytometry (FCM, Fig. S1B). Next, we generated variant libraries of FnCas12a by introducing mutations into domains, namely WED, REC, RuvC, NUC, PI, and BH, of FnCas12a through error-prone PCR (Table S2). Four unique restriction-enzyme (HindIII, ClaI, PshAI, and EcoRI) sites were found that could digest the coding sequence into three parts, namely HindIII-ClaI, ClaI-PshAI, and PshAI-EcoRI (Fig. 1A). Before library generation, we optimized mutagenesis conditions. We tested different amounts (1–100 ng) of template and found that with 1 ng plasmid template, we could introduce 2 to 7 mutations in an 860 bp fragment (the sequence between the restriction endonuclease recognition site of ClaI and PshAI, Fig. S2A, Sequence S1). Based on this optimized condition, library I (1051 colonies), library II (1119 colonies), and library III (505 colonies) were obtained (Fig. S2B). Subsequently, we randomly picked 20 colonies per library to access the genetic information of libraries (Fig. S2C). The results revealed that the mutations were evenly distributed across the coding sequence. Thus, we constructed three libraries of FnCas12a variants (2675 plasmids). We examined three libraries of FnCas12a variants in 293-SC1 cells and screened FnCas12a variants with high cleavage activity (Fig. 1, B and C). Specifically, the plasmids of FnCas12a variants plus crRNA targeting EGFP site 5 (Table S1) were transfected into the cells, and then, cleavage activity was assessed via FCM. We found that 430 variants (354 of library I, 75 of library II, and 1 of library III) retained 100% or higher activity (Fig. 1D) compared with WT FnCas12a. Then, we sought to test the fidelities of the 430 variants. We generated single-nucleotide mismatched crRNA targeting EGFP sites 5 and 44 to evaluate the fidelities of the 430 variants and found that at site 5, mismatched M5-4 crRNA had comparable activity to perfect-matched crRNA, indicating high tolerance of this mismatch at the 3′ terminal of the crRNA distal to PAM for WT FnCas12a (Fig. S3, A and B, Table S3). Therefore, we selected M5-4 crRNA to screen fidelities of the 430 variants. Under the mismatched condition, we obtained 31 variants, which had no more than 80% activity, compared with WT FnCas12a (Fig. S4, A–C). Co-transfection with perfect-matched or five single-nucleotide mismatched crRNAs (M5–1 to M5–5) revealed six variants, namely I-69, I-186, I-357, I-688, II-611, and II-717, with similar activity as WT and higher fidelity (no more than 80% activity of WT FnCas12a with single-nucleotide mismatched crRNA) than WT (Fig. S5, A–E). Further testing on site 44 (Fig. S6, A and B) revealed variants, namely I-69 and II-611, with relatively higher activities; however, variants did not exhibit a substantial increase in fidelity with different single-nucleotide mismatched crRNAs. Thus, mutants with higher activities are more likely to be identified. To boost the activity of FnCas12a, we selected these six variants as candidates (error-prone PCR templates) for second-round mutagenesis, yielding two new libraries with 1246 (library IV) and 402 variants (library V) (Fig. 1A). As described, we first examined their activity in an EGFP reporter system at site 5 (Fig. 1, B and C). Consequently, we found 39 variants from two libraries has higher activity than WT FnCas12a (Fig. 1D). We tested corresponding fidelities through mismatched M5-4 crRNA and identified six variants retaining no more than 80% activity of WT FnCas12a (Fig. S7, A and B). However, further testing on site 5 by co-transfecting with perfect-matched or five single-nucleotide mismatched crRNAs (M5-1 to M5-5) revealed that only variant (IV-79) had higher activity than WT. We selected this variant to perform further testing. Not surprising, we found that the IV-79 variant had increased activity at sites 5 and 44 (Fig. S7, C–E) and named it enhanced activity FnCas12a (eaFnCas12a). The other five mutants can be evaluated to identify high-fidelity variant(s). To further compare the editing efficiency of eaFnCas12a with the five Cas12a family orthologs and variants (AsCas12a, enAsCas12a, enAsCas12a-HF, FnCas12a, and LbCas12a [enAsCas12a and enAsCas12a-HF represent enhanced AsCas12a variants and enhanced AsCas12a variants with high-fidelity, respectively]), we performed the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-disruption assay at sites 5 and 44. The results illustrated that eaFnCas12a possesses higher activity than the Cas12a family orthologs and variants (Fig. S8). Specifically, eaFnCas12a possesses higher activity (approximately 34.88% at site 5 and 30.84% at site 44, respectively) than the four Cas12a family orthologs and variants (approximately 25.52%–29.38% at site 5 and 11.11%–28.74% at site 44, respectively) in human cells (Fig. S8). To further validate our results, 50 target sites were selected with 5′-KYTV-3′ (K: G/T, Y: C/T, V: A/C/G) PAM in EGFP (Fig. 2, A–C, Tables S1 and S4). We observed that, compared with WT, eaFnCas12a exhibited an average 1.4-fold higher activity at all tested sites (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2, B and C). Notably, eaFnCas12a exhibited robust activity (∼20%) higher than WT FnCas12a (∼14%) at EGFP site 1 to 78 with 5′-YTV-3′ (Y: C/T, V: A/C/G) PAM (Fig. 2, D and E, Tables S1 and S4), suggesting that eaFnCas12a possessed higher activity for genome engineering. To further confirm it, PAM-DOSE (PAM Definition by Observable Sequence Excision) was harnessed to delineate the PAM in human cells (23Tang L. Yang F. He X. Xie H. Liu X. Fu J. Xi H. Lu X. Liu C. Song Z. Qu J. Zhao J. Gu F. Efficient cleavage resolves PAM preferences of CRISPR-Cas in human cells.Cell Regen. 2019; 8: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We set 1% of the total reads from NGS as functional PAM. The results showed that the PAM for eaFnCas12a is 5’-YTV-3’ (Y: C/T, V: A/C/G). We also observed that the PAM of eaFnCas12a is more flexible than WT at positions −4 (Fig. S9, A–D). Notably, for certain target sequence, eaFnCas12a as well as WT has its PAM for the recognition (Fig. S9, A–D), although there is no substantial difference. To further characterize DNA cleavage activity of eaFnCas12a in endogenous human genes, 18 endogenous genomic sites harboring 5′-YTV-3′ (Y: C/T, V: A/C/G) PAM were selected for the T7E1 assay (Fig. 3A, Table S5). Compared with WT, eaFnCas12a exhibited more favorable activity with an average 1.93-fold higher indels (Fig. 3, A and B), presenting similar performance evaluated in EGFP (Fig. 2, B and E). Notably, for DNMT1-2, GSK3A, LRP6, RS1-2, TCF4-1, and TCF4-2, the eaFnCas12a variant achieved at least 2-fold higher indel formation (Fig. 3A). To confirm these results, we selected 16 endogenous sites from the above 18 endogenous genomic sites as targets for deep sequencing. Next-generation sequencing results revealed increased efficacy of eaFnCas12a-mediated genome editing at most endogenous genes (with an average 1.32-fold editing efficacy, Fig. S10, A and B), which is largely consistent with the results from the T7E1 assay. With the testing of another six sites, the results are similar (Fig. S10A). Furthermore, we predicted off-target sites using an online software (http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/) at CCR5, HBB, and GRIN2B sites. Compared with WT, no substantial increase in off target effects of eaFnCas12a was observed (Fig. S10C). All results demonstrated that the fidelity of eaFnCas12a was similar to that of FnCas12a. Thus, eaFnCas12a is an engineered Cas12a nuclease with higher activity. Recently, it was reported that RVR mutants (AsCas12a: S542R/K548V/N552R, LbCas12a: G532R/K538V/Y542R, FnCas12a: N607R/K613V/N617R, MbCas12a: N576R/K582V/N586R) and RR mutants (AsCas12a: S542R/K607R, LbCas12a: G532R/K595R, FnCas12a: N607R/K671R, MbCas12a: N576R/K637R) expanded PAM preferences at targets with 5′-TATV-3′ (V: A/C/G) PAM and 5′-TYCV-3′ (Y:T/C) PAM (22Toth E. Czene B.C. Kulcsar P.I. Krausz S.L. Talas A. Nyeste A. Varga E. Huszar K. Weinhardt N. Ligeti Z. Borsy A.E. Fodor E. Welker E. Mb- and FnCpf1 nucleases are active in mammalian cells: Activities and PAM preferences of four wild-type Cpf1 nucleases and of their altered PAM specificity variants.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 10272-10285PubMed Google Scholar). We speculated that these mutations may increase target selection of eaFnCas12a. Thus, we generated the corresponding RVR and RR mutants of eaFnCas12a (eaFnCas12a-RVR and eaFnCas12a-RR, respectively, Table S6) and compared their PAM preferences and activities on 30 target sites in EGFP with that in WT. After testing with different PAMs, we observed that eaFnCas12a-RVR and eaFnCas12a-RR notably expanded PAM selection, compared with WT (Fig. S11A). Specifically, WT and eaFnCas12a demonstrated almost no activity with 5′-TATM-3′ (M: A/C) PAM, whereas FnCas12a-RVR exhibited considerable activity (∼24.5%) and eaFnCas12a-RVR exhibited relatively higher activity (∼27.5%) than FnCas12a-RVR (Fig. S11A). Next, 17 target sites with 5′-TTCR-3′ (R: A/G) PAM were selected (Tables S1 and S4), which were used in characterizing PAM preferences and activity of eaFnCas12a-RR (Fig. 4A, Fig. S11B). We observed that both eaFnCas12a and eaFnCas12a-RR exhibited significantly higher activity than WT (p < 0.0001) or FnCas12a-RR (p < 0.01), respectively (Fig. 4A). Moreover, we tested activity of eaFnCas12a-RR at 11 target sites with 5′-TCCV-3′ (V: A/C/G) PAM (Tables S1 and S4) and found that eaFnCas12a had higher efficacy than WT (p < 0.01) and eaFnCas12a-RR had the best performance (Fig. S11, C and D). Thus, we confirmed that the mutation combination with eaFnCas12a-RVR or eaFnCas12a-RR may boost its target selection. X-linked juvenile retinoschisis is the most common form of macular dystrophy in young men, with no effective treatment (24Ambrosio L. Hansen R.M. Kimia R. Fulton A.B. Retinal function in X-linked juvenile retinoschisis.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2019; 60: 4872-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Genome editing–mediated in situ gene correction holds great promise for its clinical treatment. To investigate gene correction mediated by eaFnCas12a, we used the 293-RS1 cell line, which harbors the partial coding region of RS1 carrying the causative mutation (RS1-p.Y65X) from a patient with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (Fig. 4B, Fig. S12A) (25Chen D. Xu T. Tu M. Xu J. Zhou C. Cheng L. Yang R. Yang T. Zheng W. He X. Deng R. Ge X. Li J. Song Z. Zhao J. et al.Recapitulating X-linked juvenile retinoschisis in mouse model by knock-in patient-specific novel mutation.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2017; 10: 453Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this system, EGFP is activated when nonhomologous end joining (3n bp indels) or homology directed repair (HDR, choosing WT donor DNA oligo as template) is triggered by Cas12a at mRS1-site 1 or 2 (Fig. 4B, Tables S1 and S4). Consistent with PAMs recognized by eaFnCas12a, mRS1-sites 1 and 2 contain 5′-TTV-3′ (V: A/C/G) and 5′-TTCV-3′ PAMs, respectively. On day 5 after transfection, EGFP expression was the highest (Fig. 4C). eaFnCas12a had the best performance with or without the donor (Fig. S12, B–D). We observed a 3.28- and 4.04-fold increase in activity of the variant at mRS1-sites 1 and 2, respectively, compared with WT. (Fig. 4D). Thus, we demonstrated that gene correction efficacy can be highly increased with eaFnCas12a. We sequenced eaFnCas12a and found that it contained one amino acid substitution (position 125, from Gln [Q] to Arg [R]). We then evaluated the reason for the presence of only a single mutation. We obtained mutant sequences mutants from libraries and found that Q125R may be a novel mutation generated during the second-round mutagenesis (Fig. S13). Surprisingly, no tagged mutation of eaFnCas12a was derived from the first-round mutagenesis. We speculated that the tagged mutation was corrected during the generation of libraries IV and V. To further understand the improved activity of eaFnCas12a caused by Q125R, we analyzed the crystal structure of FnCas12a in complex with crRNA and target DNA (PDB: 5MGA, Fig. 5A). Q125 locates at the N-terminal of the REC1 domain, which participates in PAM recognition together with WED-II, WED-III, and PI domains. Briefly, the α-amines of Q125 directly contacts to the phosphate backbone of DNA, and the α-carbonyl of Q125 directly contact I128, D129, and D130 through an intrachain hydrogen bond, which does not improve activity. However, homology-modeling (SWISS-MODEL webtool) suggested that the Q125R substitution caused a loss of interaction between δ-amines of Gln125 and γ-carbonyl of Asp129 (Fig. 5B). In silico stimulation using the CUPSAT software revealed that Q125R possessed the highest stability among all predicted substitutions (2.23 kcal/mol) (Fig. 5C). Thus, we proposed that the Q125R substitution may increase the stability and positive charge of FnCas12a to enable extensive contacts between FnCas12a and negatively charged DNA substrates. Then, we systemically examined the effects of additional substitutions of Q125 on activity (Fig. 5D, Table S2). When Q125 was changed to D or E, a notable decrease in activity was observed because of the negative charge of these residues. Q125P led to local structural distortions of FnCas12a and thus compromised its catalytic activity. Q125K possessed increased activity at sites 5, 19, and 38 compared with WT FnCas12a, which may be because of the strong positive charge of K (Fig. 5C). Further studies will be required to ascertain the mechanisms by which eaFnCas12a achieves high activity. Based on the structure of FnCas12a (26Stella S. Alcon P. Montoya G. Structure of the Cpf1 endonuclease R-loop complex after target DNA cleavage.Nature. 2017; 546: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we sought to identify mutants with higher activity. Therefore, we generated and tested additional mutants, namely N124R, I128R, D129R, A130R, T176R, T177R, K180R, N666R, T696R, K699R, and G701R (Fig. S14, A–D, Table S7). However, these mutants did not exhibit increased activity, except for A130R at site 44, compared with eaFnCas12a (Fig. S14C). Then, we generated mutants harboring Q125R in addition to these mutations; however, no boost in activity was observed (Fig. S14, A–D), which indicated the absence of synergic effects of Q125R with tested mutations. Thus, Q125R may play a crucial role in boosting activity. According to the previous report, Cas12a activity can be enhanced through crRNA engineering (27Bin Moon S. Lee J.M. Kang J.G. Lee N.E. Ha D.I. Kim D.Y. Kim S.H. Yoo K. Kim D. Ko J.H. Kim Y.S. Highly efficient genome editing by CRISPR-Cpf1 using CRISPR RNA with a uridinylate-rich 3'-overhang.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We engineered the crRNA sequence and investigated whether it could boost the activity of eaFnCas12a at seven target EGFP sites. Our results revealed that, compared with WT, eaFnCas12a has higher editing efficacy with the engineered crRNA sequence (U4A) in crRNA. No synergistic effect of FnCas12a and engineered crRNA was found (Fig. S15). The Cas12a-family is a complementary nuclease family with low off-target effects and distinct PAMs compared with the Cas9-family. Although the nucleases AsCas12a and LbCas12a are commonly used for gene editing, FnCas12a can be used in plants and humans (16Wu W.Y. Lebbink J.H.G. Kanaar R. Geijsen N. van der Oost J.

The virtual perturbation study was planned to perform using single case of proximal tibia model. We determined whether the implant materials’ stiffness affects the degree of periprosthetic tibial bone resorption, and whether the effect of material change with the same implant design differed according to the proximal tibial plateau areas. Materials and methods This three-dimensional finite element analysis included two cobalt-chromium (CoCr) and two titanium (Ti) tibial implants with different designs. They were implanted into the proximal tibial model reconstructed using extracted images from computed tomography. The degree of bone resorption or formation was measured using the strain energy density after applying axial load. The same analysis was performed after exchanging the materials while maintaining the design of each implant. Results The degree of periprosthetic tibial bone resorption was not determined by the type of implant materials alone. When the implant materials were changed from Ti to CoCr, the bone resorption in the medial compartment increased and vice versa. The effect of material composition’s change on anterior and posterior areas varied accordingly. Conclusions Although the degree of bone resorption was associated with implant materials, it differed depending on the design of each implant. The effect on the degree of bone resorption according to the materials after TKA should be evaluated while concomitantly considering design."
https://openalex.org/W3126248738,"Background Low birth weight puts a newborn at increased risk of death and illness, and limits their productivity in the adulthood period later. The incidence of low birth weight has been selected as an important indicator for monitoring major health goals by the World Summit for Children. The 2014 World Health Organization estimation of child death indicated that 4.53% of total deaths in Ethiopia were due to low birth weight. The aim of this study was to assess trends of proximate low birth weight and associations of low birth weight with potential determinants from 2011 to 2016. Methods This study used the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data (EDHS) as data sources. According to the 2016 EDHS data, all the regions were stratified into urban and rural areas. The variable “size of child” measured according to the report of mothers before two weeks of the EDHS takes placed. The study sample refined from EDHS data and used for this further analysis were 7919 children. A logistic regression model was used to assess the association of proximate low birth weight and potential determinates of proximate low birth weight. But, the data were tested to model fitness and were fitted to Hosmer-Lemeshow-goodness of fit. Results The prevalence of proximate low birth weight in Ethiopia was 26.9% (2132), (95%CI = 25.4, 27.9). Of the prevalence of child size in year from 2011 to 2016, 17.1% was very small, and 9.8% was small. In the final multivariate logistic regression model, region (AOR = xx), (955%CI = xx), Afar (AOR = 2.44), (95%CI = 1.82, 3.27), Somalia (AOR = 0.73), (95%CI = 0.55, 0.97), Benishangul-Gumz (AOR = 0.48), (95%CI = 0.35, 0.67), SNNPR (AOR = 0.67), (95%CI = 0.48, 0.93), religion, Protestant (AOR = 0.76), (95%CI = 0.60, 0.95), residence, rural (AOR = 1.39), (95%CI = 1.07, 1.81), child sex, female (AOR = 1.43), (95%CI = 1.29, 1.59), birth type, multiple birth during first parity (AOR = 2.18), (95%CI = 1.41, 3.37), multiple birth during second parity (AOR = 2.92), (95%CI = 1.86, 4.58), preparedness for birth, wanted latter child (AOR = 1.26), (95%CI = 1.09, 1.47), fast and rapid breathing (AOR = 1.22), (95%CI = 1.02, 1.45), maternal education, unable to read and write (AOR = 1.46), (95%CI = 1.56, 2.17), and maternal age, 15–19 years old (AOR = 1.86), (95%CI = 1.19, 2.92) associated with proximate low birth weight. Conclusions The proximate LBW prevalence as indicated by small child size is high. Region, religion, residence, birth type, preparedness for birth, fast and rapid breathing, maternal education, and maternal age were associated with proximate low birth weight.

https://openalex.org/W3127374656,"DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are toxic DNA lesions that interfere with DNA metabolic processes such as replication, transcription, and recombination. USP11 deubiquitinase participates in DNA repair, but the role of USP11 in DPC repair is not known. SPRTN is a replication-coupled DNA-dependent metalloprotease that cleaves proteins cross-linked to DNA to promote DPC repair. SPRTN function is tightly regulated by a monoubiquitin switch that controls SPRTN auto-proteolysis and chromatin accessibility during DPC repair. Previously, VCPIP1 and USP7 deubiquitinases have been shown to regulate SPRTN. Here, we identify USP11 as an SPRTN deubiquitinase. USP11 interacts with SPRTN and cleaves monoubiquitinated SPRTN in cells and in vitro. USP11 depletion impairs SPRTN deubiquitination and promotes SPRTN auto-proteolysis in response to formaldehyde-induced DPCs. Loss of USP11 causes an accumulation of unrepaired DPCs and cellular hypersensitivity to treatment with DPC-inducing agents. Our findings show that USP11 regulates SPRTN auto-proteolysis and SPRTN-mediated DPC repair to maintain genome stability."

Dysregulated autophagy contributes to the abnormal proliferation of trophoblasts, which is closely related to the occurrence of pregnancy-related diseases. Placenta specific 8 (PLAC8, Onzin) is a multifaceted protein proven to promote autophagy and potentiate various tumor progression. Its role in trophoblasts remains elusive. In our present study, PLAC8 expression was detected in tissues of first-trimester placentas (n = 5), term placentas (n = 5), choriocarcinoma (n = 5), and placental site trophoblastic tumor (n = 5). PLAC8 expression was increased in gestational neoplasms compared with normal pregnancies. mCherry-EGFP-LC3B reporter and transmission electron microscopy confirmed PLAC8 promoted the autophagic flux of human trophoblast cells. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments demonstrated PLAC8-regulated autophagy-related genes, including ATG5, ATG12, and Beclin-1. In addition, our data showed that PLAC8 co-localized with p53 and promoted its degradation, and p53 re-expression partially abrogated the PLAC8-induced autophagy activity. Furthermore, the overexpression of PLAC8 promoted cell viability and proliferation, acting as a protective mechanism of trophoblasts against the cytotoxicity of etoposide (VP-16). Such a phenomenon was effectively abrogated by autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ). In conclusion, PLAC8-induced autophagy to promote the proliferation of trophoblasts. This study provided insights into the mechanism of PLAC8-induced autophagy in trophoblasts, which is significant for a wide range of gestational diseases and may contribute to developing novel treatment strategies for trophoblastic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3126953255,"Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen whose pathogenic lifestyle is linked to its ability to cope with fluctuating levels of copper (Cu), an essential metal involved in multiple virulence mechanisms, within distinct host niches. During lethal cryptococcal meningitis in the brain, C. neoformans senses a Cu-deficient environment and is highly dependent on its ability to scavenge trace levels of Cu from its host and adapt to Cu scarcity to successfully colonize this niche. In this study, we demonstrate for this critical adaptation, the Cu-sensing transcription factor Cuf1 differentially regulates the expression of the SOD1 and SOD2 superoxide dismutases in novel ways. Genetic and transcriptional analysis reveals Cuf1 specifies 5’-truncations of the SOD1 and SOD2 mRNAs through specific binding to Cu responsive elements within their respective promoter regions. This results in Cuf1-dependent repression of the highly abundant SOD1 and simultaneously induces expression of two isoforms of SOD2, the canonical mitochondrial targeted isoform and a novel alternative cytosolic isoform, from a single alternative transcript produced specifically under Cu limitation. The generation of cytosolic Sod2 during Cu limitation is required to maintain cellular antioxidant defense against superoxide stress both in vitro and in vivo. Further, decoupling Cuf1 regulation of Sod2 localization compromises the ability of C. neoformans to colonize organs in murine models of cryptococcosis.

As a successful human pathogen, C. neoformans must adapt to environmental extremes and insults encountered within the host during infection and is reliant upon the host for nutrients and essential trace metals (6Garcia-Santamarina S.

Copper at the front line of the host-pathogen battle.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8e1002887Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, through a process termed nutritional immunity, the immune system actively sequesters and withholds nutritional Fe, Mn, and Zn from pathogens to deprive them of essential trace elements (8Hood M.I.

In turn, successful pathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to acquire metals from their host, circumventing nutritional immunity. In contrast to Fe, Mn, and Zn limitation, the host elevates levels of copper (Cu) to induce Cu poisoning within the hostile environment of macrophage phagosomes (9Ladomersky E. Khan A. Shanbhag V.

Cu has potent antimicrobial activities and, in part, exerts its effects through uncontrolled redox cycling to propagate the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) (17Besold A.N.

Generation and propagation of radical reactions on proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 196-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). More recent work has shown that Cu also exerts toxicity through displacement of Fe from essential Fe-S cluster containing enzymes, rendering them inactive, and by disrupting the Fe-S cluster biogenesis machinery (19Macomber L.

However, local Cu concentrations also change in response to microbial infection in a tissue-specific manner. For example, Cu levels decrease in the kidney during chronic infection by Candida albicans (23Besold A.N. Gilston B.A. Radin J.N. Ramsoomair C. Culbertson E.M. Li C.X. Cormack B.P. Chazin W.J.

Moreover, while whole animal imaging demonstrated that C. neoformans is exposed to elevated host Cu levels mobilized in alveolar macrophages, it senses Cu deficiency in the brain during cryptococcal meningitis and responds by activating expression of the Cu+ import machinery (25Sun T.S. Ju X. Gao H.L. Wang T. Thiele D.J. Li J.Y. Wang Z.Y. Ding C. Reciprocal functions of Cryptococcus neoformans copper homeostasis machinery during pulmonary infection and meningoencephalitis.Nat.

It has also been reported that Cu deprivation can occur within macrophages, in a manner similar to traditional metal withholding strategies, suggesting immune responses may vary dependent upon infection type, stimulation of different immune response pathways, or acute versus chronic stages of infection (27Waterman S.R. Park Y.D. Raja M. Qiu J. Hammoud D.A. O'Halloran T.V. Williamson P.R.

Macrophage activation by IFN-gamma triggers restriction of phagosomal copper from intracellular pathogens.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14e1007444Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is yet to be determined whether decreases in local Cu concentrations are because of inherent low bioavailability of Cu within these host niches or if bona fide Cu nutritional immunity mechanisms are implemented in response to infection, similar to those described for Fe, Mn, and Zn. Interestingly, Cu has also been shown to promote Helicobacter pylori colonization of gut epithelia through interactions with host trefoil peptides (29Montefusco S. Esposito R. D'Andrea L. Monti M.C. Dunne C. Dolan B. Tosco A. Marzullo L. Clyne M. Copper promotes TFF1-mediated Helicobacter pylori colonization.PLoS One. 2013; 8e79455Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, Cu has many facets mediating a dynamic interplay between host–pathogen interactions and pathogenic outcomes during infection. Cu catalyzes numerous biochemical functions, many of which are required for virulence in C. neoformans (6Garcia-Santamarina S. Thiele D.J. Copper at the fungal pathogen-host axis.J. Biol.

Cu serves as a cofactor for cellular respiration, high affinity iron uptake, melanin production, as well as detoxification of superoxide radical anions via superoxide dismutase (SOD), among other functions (31Cox G.M.

Novel gene functions required for melanization of the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1381-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Traditionally, SOD enzymes are critical cellular antioxidants that are evolutionarily highly conserved in structure and function and catalyze the disproportionation of superoxide into O2 and H2O2 (35Fridovich I. Superoxide dismutases.Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1986; 58: 61-97PubMed Google Scholar, 36McCord J.M. Fridovich I. Superoxide dismutase. An enzymic function for erythrocuprein (hemocuprein).J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eukaryotes typically express at least two classes of SODs, those that require Cu and Zn for catalysis (Sod1) and those that use Mn as a catalytic cofactor (Sod2). In Cu, Zn Sod1 enzymes, the Zn cofactor serves solely a structural role in maintaining the active site, whereas the Cu cofactor is the catalytic redox center (37Culotta V.C. Yang M. O'Halloran T.V. Activation of superoxide dismutases: Putting the metal to the pedal.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The mature Sod1 enzyme is a homodimer and is primarily localized within the cytoplasm, with a small but significant fraction also localized within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) (38Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. A fraction of yeast Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase and its metallochaperone, CCS, localize to the intermembrane space of mitochondria. A physiological role for SOD1 in guarding against mitochondrial oxidative damage.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sod2, a Mn-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the identical chemistry for superoxide anion disproportionation as Sod1. Sod2 is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix by an encoded amino-terminal mitochondrial import peptide (MIP). This positively charged leader sequence is recognized by the mitochondrial import machinery (TOM/TIM complexes), and Sod2 is translocated into the mitochondria as the nascent peptide exits the ribosome in an unfolded or semiunfolded state (39Wispe J.R. Clark J.C. Burhans M.S. Kropp K.E. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Synthesis and processing of the precursor for human mangano-superoxide dismutase.Biochim. Biophys.

Protein unfolding and the energetics of protein translocation across biological membranes.Cell. 1988; 52: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As Sod2 is transported into the mitochondrial lumen, an inner membrane peptidase cleaves the MIP, and with the help of the Mtm1 inner membrane chaperone, Sod2 is thought to fold around its Mn cofactor (37Culotta V.C. Yang M. O'Halloran T.V. Activation of superoxide dismutases: Putting the metal to the pedal.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 41Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M. Culotta V.C. Manganese activation of superoxide dismutase 2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires MTM1, a member of the mitochondrial carrier family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10353-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The mature form of Sod2 then assembles as an active homotetramer in the mitochondrial lumen. Pathogens must secure sufficient quantities of Cu, Zn, and Mn from their hosts to sustain SOD activity, a daunting challenge in the face of host imposed nutritional immunity. Here, we demonstrate that the Cu-sensing transcription factor Cuf1 orchestrates an adaptive response to Cu limitation through both the reciprocal regulation of the SODs, SOD1 and SOD2, and by driving a change in the subcellular location of Sod2. Cuf1 represses expression of the highly abundant SOD1 and simultaneously induces expression of two isoforms of SOD2 from an alternative transcript produced specifically under Cu limitation: the canonical mitochondrial targeted isoform and a novel alternative cytosolic isoform. Cuf1 drives the generation of SOD1 and SOD2 transcripts that have shorter 5’ ends, as compared with those species found under Cu sufficiency conditions, through recognition of Cu-responsive elements (CuREs) within their promoter regions. Replacement of Sod1 with cytosolic Sod2 is required to maintain cellular superoxide buffering and contributes to the ability of C. neoformans to resist oxidative stress and impacts colonization of the brain during cryptococcal meningitis. Thus, Cuf1 plays a vital role in virulence by activating the Cu detoxification machinery in the lung, the Cu uptake machinery in the brain, and by altering the subcellular localization of a Mn-dependent Sod2 protein that is required for protection from the oxidative burst. From our previous comparative mRNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis of C. neoformans cultures grown under elevated Cu or Cu limiting conditions, the genome-wide Cu-responsive, Cuf1-dependent regulon of C. neoformans was identified (42Garcia-Santamarina S. Festa R.A. Smith A.D. Yu C.H. Probst C. Ding C. Homer C.M. Yin J. Noonan J.P. Madhani H. Perfect J.R. Thiele D.J. Genome-wide analysis of the regulation of Cu metabolism in Cryptococcus neoformans.Mol. Microbiol. 2018; 108: 473-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This work revealed 96 genes in the Cuf1 regulon, of which two encode the Cu, Zn-dependent SOD1 (CNAG_01019) and the Mn-dependent SOD2 (CNAG_04388). Multiple sequence alignment reveals the conserved nature of the SODs as well as their highly conserved metal coordinating ligands within their respective active site (Fig. S1, A and B). ChIP-seq data demonstrate strong enrichment of Cuf1 at the SOD1 promoter primarily during Cu limitation, with a modest enrichment in the presence of Cu (Fig. 1A), and mRNA-seq data show a ∼3-fold decrease in SOD1 transcript levels when cells were supplemented with the extracellular Cu+ chelator bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS) (Fig. 1B). A strong enrichment of Cuf1 was also observed within the SOD2 promoter with a ∼6-fold induction in transcript levels when cells were grown under Cu limitation (Fig. 1, C and D). Further, the regulation of both genes was Cuf1-dependent (Fig. S2, A and B). Interestingly, upon inspection of the transcript sequencing reads aligned to the annotated C. neoformans H99 genome, a 5’-truncated SOD1 transcript was almost exclusively detected from Cu-limited cells. This transcript skips the first coding exon 1 (Fig. 1B), and its generation is dependent on the presence of Cuf1 (Fig. S2C). Additionally, examination of the aligned sequencing reads for SOD2 revealed that this transcript has a shorter 5’-upstream region when cells were grown under Cu limitation (Fig. 1D), the generation of which was also dependent on Cuf1 (Fig. S2D). However, compared with the SOD1 full-length transcript only, the 5’-untranslated region (5’-UTR) of the SOD2 transcript was omitted, leaving the first exon intact. It is important to note our previous transcriptome studies used 1 mM CuSO4 to induce conditions of Cu excess (42Garcia-Santamarina S. Festa R.A. Smith A.D. Yu C.H. Probst C. Ding C. Homer C.M. Yin J. Noonan J.P. Madhani H. Perfect J.R. Thiele D.J. Genome-wide analysis of the regulation of Cu metabolism in Cryptococcus neoformans.Mol. Microbiol. 2018; 108: 473-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). While markers for Cu excess such as the metallothionein, MT1 and MT2, transcripts are highly induced at this concentration, we also noted several other stress markers that were induced in a non-Cuf1–dependent manner, suggesting activation of Cuf1-independent stress pathways. For the studies described here, we selected 0.1 to 0.3 mM CuSO4 for Cu excess, a condition amenable for sustained growth of C. neoformans, does not interfere with subsequent biochemical assays, and still highly activates MT1, a hallmark for Cu excess (Fig. S2E) (43Ding C. Yin J. Tovar E.M. Fitzpatrick D.A. Higgins D.G. Thiele D.J. The copper regulon of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans H99.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 81: 1560-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For several studies, we also used a Cu-sufficient condition of 5 μM CuSO4 which neither activated the expression of MT1 nor the copper transporter CTR4, the latter a hallmark of Cu deficiency (Fig. S2, E and F). We further validated the SOD1 and SOD2 ChIP-seq (Fig. 2A) and mRNA-seq (Fig. 2, B and C) datasets by ChIP-qPCR and qRT-PCR, respectively. Importantly, we designed our primers to anneal near the 3’-end of the generated SOD1 and SOD2 cDNA products to prevent the exclusion of any truncated transcript from the qRT-PCR analysis. To ascertain if there was a correlation between changes in SOD1 and SOD2 transcript levels with that of protein abundance, Sod1 and Sod2 protein levels were analyzed from cells cultured in the presence of Cu or BCS. Although an anti-Sod1 antibody against Saccharomyces cerevisiae (44Torres A.S. Petri V. Rae T.D. O'Halloran T.V. Copper stabilizes a heterodimer of the yCCS metallochaperone and its target superoxide dismutase.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38410-38416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) cross-reacted with C. neoformans Sod1, there was no cross-reactivity of a yeast anti-Sod2 antibody against C. neoformans Sod2 (45Luk E.E. Culotta V.C. Manganese superoxide dismutase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae acquires its metal co-factor through a pathway involving the Nramp metal transporter, Smf2p.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A functional (see below) carboxyl-terminal epitope-tagged allele of SOD2 (2x-hemagglutinin [HA] epitope at its native genomic locus) was generated for these experiments (SOD2HA). In cells grown with sufficient or excess Cu, constitutive expression of Sod1 and Sod2 was detected (Fig. 2D). However, cells cultured in the presence of BCS showed a time dependent decrease in Sod1 abundance that paralleled an increase in Sod2 protein levels (Fig. 2D). Cuf1 recognizes and binds to conserved CuREs within the promoter regions of the Cu-deficiency inducible genes (42Garcia-Santamarina S. Festa R.A. Smith A.D. Yu C.H. Probst C. Ding C. Homer C.M. Yin J. Noonan J.P. Madhani H. Perfect J.R. Thiele D.J. Genome-wide analysis of the regulation of Cu metabolism in Cryptococcus neoformans.Mol. Microbiol. 2018; 108: 473-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Using the MEME suite software (46Bailey T.L. Boden M. Buske F.A. Frith M. Grant C.E. Clementi L. Ren J. Li W.W. Noble W.S. Meme suite: Tools for motif discovery and searching.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: W202-W208Crossref PubMed Scopus (4442) Google Scholar), putative CuREs embedded in the SOD1 and SOD2 genes were identified (Fig. 3A and Table S1). For SOD1, three putative CuRE sequences were identified, with two located within the 5’-UTR and a single CuRE within the first intron. For SOD2, two tandem CuRE sequences within the 5’-UTR were identified. These sequences conform to the consensus 5′-(A/T)AA(T/G)G(G/C)C(T/G)C(A/G)-3′, which closely resembles the CuRE sequences identified in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans (47Woodacre A. Mason R.P.

Unfortunately, because of the large area of Cuf1 enrichment around the SOD1 and SOD2 promoters, along with the close proximity of the CuREs to one another, we could not definitively identify which CuREs were involved in mediating Cuf1 binding by our ChIP-seq datasets alone. To assess the impact of the putative CuREs on SOD1 expression, a sod1Δ strain was generated by replacement of the SOD1 allele with a neomycin (NEO) cassette. A WT copy of SOD1 harboring the native promoter and an additional carboxy-terminal FLAG epitope (SOD1C), or an epitope-tagged SOD1 allele with individually mutated CuRE sites (SOD1-CuRE1/2mut and SOD1-CuRE3mut) or in combination (SOD1-CuRE1/2/3mut) was re-introduced within the safe haven locus (50Arras S.D. Chitty J.L. Blake K.L. Schulz B.L. Fraser J.A. A genomic safe haven for mutant complementation in Cryptococcus neoformans.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0122916Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) of the sod1Δ strain. Additionally, the WT SOD1 allele was tagged with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope at its native genomic locus (SOD1FLAG) to generate an isogenic control strain. The previous qRT-PCR studies revealed that SOD1 expression is repressed during Cu limitation (Fig. 2B), but mutation of CuRE1/2 within the SOD1 promoter alleviated this repression (Fig. 3C). Mutation of CuRE1/2 had no impact on SOD1 expression in the presence of Cu. The CuRE3 mutant showed a similar extent of repression compared with the SOD1C strain when treated with BCS but interestingly was also repressed in the presence of Cu (Fig. 3C). This repression was also observed in the triple mutant (SOD1-CuRE1/2/3mut) when cells were treated with Cu. Additionally, despite mutating both CuRE1 and CuRE2, the added mutation of CuRE3 in the triple mutant prevented SOD1 de-repression as seen in the SOD1-CuRE1/2mut strain during Cu deficiency (Fig. 3C). This suggests while CuRE1 and CuRE2 are absolutely required for SOD1 repression during Cu deficiency, CuRE3 may have a role in activating SOD1 expression by some unknown mechanism that is independent of Cu status. These changes in transcript levels were reflected at the level of Sod1 protein as assessed by immunoblot for the WT, SOD1FLAG, SOD1C, and SOD1-CuRE1/2mut strains (Fig. 3D). These mutants express high levels of Sod1 protein in the presence of Cu. However, cells experiencing Cu deficiency nearly completely extinguish Sod1 expression, with the exception of the CuRE1/2 mutant which can no longer repress the expression of SOD1 through Cuf1. While transcript levels were decreased in the SOD1-CuRE3mut and SOD1-CuRE1/2/3mut strains compared with the SOD1C strain when treated with Cu, any strain harboring the CuRE3 mutation failed to express sufficient levels of Sod1 protein under eit"

Yet, our understanding of its pathogenesis and biology remains limited which can be attributed in part to the scarce of tools for molecular genetic analysis of this bacterium. Plasmids based on pWH1277 originally isolated from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus are the only vehicles currently available for ectopic gene expression in Acinetobacter species, which restricts experiments that require simultaneous analysis of multiple genes. Here, we found that plasmids of the IncQ group are able to replicate in A . baumannii and can stably co-reside with derivatives of pWH1277. Furthermore, we have constructed a series of four plasmids that allow inducible expression of Flag-tagged proteins in A . baumannii by arabinose or isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Together with constructs previously developed, these plasmids will accommodate the need in genetic analysis of this increasingly important pathogen."

We previously identified phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (Pik3r1) as a primary target gene of skeletal muscle glucocorticoid receptors involved in the glucocorticoid-mediated suppression of insulin action. However, the in vivo functions of Pik3r1 remain unclear. Here, we generated striated muscle-specific Pik3r1 knockout (MKO) mice and treated them with a dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid. Treating wildtype (WT) mice with DEX attenuated insulin activated Akt activity in liver, epididymal white adipose tissue, and gastrocnemius (GA) muscle. This DEX effect was diminished in GA muscle of MKO mice, therefore, resulting in improved glucose and insulin tolerance in DEX-treated MKO mice. Stable isotope labeling techniques revealed that in WT mice, DEX treatment decreased protein fractional synthesis rates in GA muscle. Furthermore, histology showed that in WT mice, DEX treatment reduced GA myotube diameters. In MKO mice, myotube diameters were smaller than in WT mice, and there were more fast oxidative fibers. Importantly, DEX failed to further reduce myotube diameters. Pik3r1 knockout also decreased basal protein synthesis rate (likely caused by lower 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at Thr37/Thr46) and curbed the ability of DEX to attenuate protein synthesis rate. Finally, the ability of DEX to inhibit eIF2α phosphorylation and insulin-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was reduced in MKO mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate the role of Pik3r1 in glucocorticoid-mediated effects on glucose and protein metabolism in skeletal muscle.

Taken together, these results demonstrate the role of Pik3r1 in glucocorticoid-mediated effects on glucose and protein metabolism in skeletal muscle. Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that play important roles in regulating whole body metabolism under stress conditions, mainly by mobilizing energy sources to face severe challenges. In skeletal muscle, glucocorticoids inhibit protein synthesis, facilitate protein degradation, and suppress glucose utilization. Amino acids generated from glucocorticoid-induced protein mobilization are the precursors for hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibiting glucose utilization raises plasma glucose concentrations (1Kuo T.

Glucocorticoids and metabolic control.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2016; 233: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids convey their functions through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is a transcription factor that binds to genomic glucocorticoid response elements to modulate the transcriptional rate of its target genes. Thus, GR primary target genes initiate the physiological actions of glucocorticoids. To understand the mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid actions in skeletal muscle, we previously used a combination of global gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to identify a list of potential GR primary target genes in murine C2C12 myotubes (6Kuo T. Lew M.J. Mayba O. Harris C.A. Speed T.P. Wang J.C. Genome-wide analysis of glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites in myotubes identifies gene networks modulating insulin signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 11160-11165Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (Pik3r1, a.k.a. p85α) is one of these potential GR primary target genes (6Kuo T. Lew M.J. Mayba O. Harris C.A. Speed T.P. Wang J.C. Genome-wide analysis of glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites in myotubes identifies gene networks modulating insulin signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 11160-11165Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and encodes a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which is composed of a regulatory subunit (Pik3r1, Pik3r2, or Pik3r3) and a catalytic subunit (Pik3ca1 or Pik3ca2) (7Cantley L.C. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway.Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4473) Google Scholar, 8Jean S. Kiger A.A. Classes of phosphoinositide 3-kinases at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). When insulin signaling is activated, PI3K is recruited to the activated insulin receptor substrate 1 to convert phosphatidylinositol-4, 5 bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5 triphosphate. Binding to phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5 triphosphate at the plasma membrane is required to activate protein kinase Akt (9Hemmings B.A. Restuccia D.F. PI3K-PKB/Akt pathway.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4a011189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), a key signaling molecule in mediating the metabolic functions of insulin. Though Pik3r1 is a key component of the insulin pathway, overexpression of monomeric Pik3r1 was found to suppress insulin signaling in myotubes and hepatocytes (10Barbour L.A. Mizanoor Rahman S. Gurevich I. Leitner J.W. Fischer S.J. Roper M.D. Knotts T.A. Vo Y. McCurdy C.E. Yakar S. Leroith D. Kahn C.R. Cantley L.C. Friedman J.E. Draznin B.

Biol. 2007; 27: 2830-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Conversely, Pik3r1 deficiency has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity (12Mauvais-Jarvis F. Ueki K. Fruman D.A. Hirshman M.F. Sakamoto K. Goodyear L.J. Iannacone M. Accili D. Cantley L.C. Kahn C.R.

Genet. 1999; 21: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed for the inhibitory effect of excess Pik3r1 on insulin signaling. First, monomeric Pik3r1 competes with heterodimeric PI3K for binding to insulin receptor substrate-1 to suppress insulin signaling (14Luo J. Field S.J. Lee J.Y. Engelman J.A. Cantley L.C. The p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase down-regulates IRS-1 signaling via the formation of a sequestration complex.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Pik3r1 could enhance the activity of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) to inhibit PI3K (15Chagpar R.B. Links P.H. Pastor M.C. Furber L.A. Hawrysh A.D. Chamberlain M.D. Anderson D.H. Direct positive regulation of PTEN by the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 5471-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Another report shows that homodimeric but not monomeric Pik3r1 suppresses PI3K by protecting PTEN from ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Further, the p85alpha homodimer enhances lipid phosphatase activity and membrane association of PTEN (16Cheung L.W. Walkiewicz K.W. Besong T.M. Guo H. Hawke D.H. Arold S.T. Mills G.B. Regulation of the PI3K pathway through a p85alpha monomer-homodimer equilibrium.eLife. 2015; 4e06866Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We previously found that the overexpression of Pik3r1 in C2C12 myotubes reduced cell diameter while reduction in Pik3r1 expression compromised glucocorticoid suppression of insulin signaling (6Kuo T. Lew M.J. Mayba O. Harris C.A. Speed T.P. Wang J.C. Genome-wide analysis of glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites in myotubes identifies gene networks modulating insulin signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 11160-11165Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of Pik3r1 in glucocorticoid actions in skeletal muscle, we created striated muscle–specific Pik3r1 knockout mice (MKO) (17Luo J. Sobkiw C.L. Hirshman M.F. Logsdon M.N. Li T.Q. Goodyear L.J. Cantley L.C. Loss of class IA PI3K signaling in muscle leads to impaired muscle growth, insulin response, and hyperlipidemia.Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 355-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We treated MKO and Pik3r1flox/flox mice (will be referred as wildtype, WT, mice in this report) with or without a synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX), and studied the effects on insulin signaling in metabolic tissues, including liver, gastrocnemius (GA) muscle, and epididymal white adipose tissue. We also examined the effect of striated muscle Pik3r1 deletion on systemic glucose and insulin tolerance. In addition, using stable isotope labeling techniques and tandem mass spectrometry, we analyzed the DEX effects on protein synthesis rates in GA muscle of WT and MKO mice. Finally, we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and conducted histological analysis of the GA muscle in WT and MKO mice. We previously showed that Pik3r1 gene expression was elevated in mouse GA muscle upon DEX treatment (6Kuo T. Lew M.J. Mayba O. Harris C.A. Speed T.P. Wang J.C. Genome-wide analysis of glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites in myotubes identifies gene networks modulating insulin signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 11160-11165Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We examined whether Pik3r1 protein expression was indeed increased by DEX treatment. Male WT mice were injected intraperitoneally with DEX or PBS daily for 1, 4, or 7 days. GA muscles were collected to detect the expression of Pik3r1 using immunoblotting. We found that Pik3r1 expression was significantly increased upon DEX treatment for 4 and 7 days (Fig. 1A). To confirm the activation of Pik3r1 gene transcription by GR in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to test the recruitment of GR to the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) of Pik3r1 gene in mouse GA muscle. Eight-week-old male WT mice were injected intraperitoneally with PBS or DEX for 4 days before tissue collection for ChIP given that Pik3r1 had the highest protein expression with 4 days of DEX treatment. The glucocorticoid response element of Pik3r1 has been located between −43,938 and −43,924 upstream of the mouse Pik3r1 gene (6Kuo T. Lew M.J. Mayba O. Harris C.A. Speed T.P. Wang J.C. Genome-wide analysis of glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites in myotubes identifies gene networks modulating insulin signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 11160-11165Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We found that GR was significantly recruited to the Pik3r1 GRE by DEX treatment (approximately 15-fold comparing to IgG ChIP control) (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, GR was also recruited to the Pik3r1 GRE in PBS-treated animals to a lesser degree (approximately 5-fold, Fig. 1B). This suggests that plasma corticosterone levels are enough to activate Pik3r1 gene transcription through GR. Transcriptional activation is associated with elevated histone acetylation in the enhancer regions (18Shahbazian M.D. Grunstein M. Functions of site-specific histone acetylation and deacetylation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 19Calo E. Wysocka J. Modification of enhancer chromatin: What, how, and why?.Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). We performed ChIP to monitor the acetylated histone H3 (AcH3) and H4 (AcH4) and total H3 and H4 at the Pik3r1 GRE in the GA muscle of PBS and DEX-treated WT mice. The ratios of AcH3/H3 and AcH4/H4 represent the degrees of the histone acetylation in H3 and H4, respectively. As shown in Figure 1C, the level of total histone H3 and H4 was not significantly affected by DEX treatment. However, comparing to IgG control, the ratios of AcH3/H3 and AcH4/H4 were significantly increased by 8 and 10 folds with DEX treatment, respectively (Fig. 1C). In PBS treated animals, the ratios of AcH3/H3 and AcH4/H4 were also significantly higher than the IgG ChIP control (approximately 3 and 7 folds, respectively, Fig. 1C). This observation was consistent with the finding that GR was also recruited to the Pik3r1 GRE under PBS treatment. Nonetheless, the ratios of AcH3/H3 and AcH4/H4 were higher in DEX-treated mice than those of PBS-treated mice. This was in agreement with a stronger GR recruitment to the Pik3r1 GRE under DEX treatment (Fig. 1C). We next examined which histone acetyltransferase is recruited to the Pik3r1 GRE using ChIP. We found that p300 but not Tip60 and GCN5 was significantly recruited to the GRE upon DEX treatment (Fig. 1D). These results suggested that p300 accounted for the higher histone acetylation status at the GRE upon DEX treatment. Notably, neither p300, Tip60, nor GCN5 were recruited to the GRE upon PBS treatment (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that histone acetyltransferase(s) other than these three are involved in the acetylation of the Pik3r1 GRE in PBS-treated mice. To test whether p300 is involved in GR-activated Pik3r1 gene transcription, C2C12 myoblasts were infected with lentivirus expressing scramble small hairpin RNA (sh-scrRNA, control) or shRNA against p300 (sh-p300). After puromycin selection, cells were differentiated into myotubes, then treated with DEX or EtOH for 6 h. RNA was isolated from these cells, and qPCR was performed to monitor the expression of Pik3r1. In sh-scrRNA expressing C2C12 myotubes, DEX treatment increased the expression of Pik3r1 approximately 3-fold (Fig. 1E). However, in sh-p300 expressing C2C12 myotubes, such DEX effect was abolished (Fig. 1E). The Western blot showed that p300 was efficiently reduced by RNAi (Fig. 1E). We generated striated muscle–specific Pik3r1 knockout mice (MKO) by crossing Pik3r1flox/flox mice with transgenic mice carrying muscle creatine kinase promoter driving the expression of Cre recombinase (20Bruning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Horsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. A muscle-specific insulin receptor knockout exhibits features of the metabolic syndrome of NIDDM without altering glucose tolerance.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). In MKO mice, Pik3r1 expression was indeed depleted in skeletal muscles, including GA muscle, tibialis anterior muscle, and soleus muscle (Fig. 2A). Notably, Pik3r1 expression was similar in the liver of WT and MKO mice (Fig. 2A). These results validated the specific deletion of Pik3r1 in the striated muscle. We also tested the ability of DEX to induce the expression of GR primary target gene in GA muscle of WT and MKO mice. WT and MKO mice were treated with PBS or DEX for 7 days. GA muscle RNA was isolated, and qPCR was performed to examine the DEX induction of two previously identified GR primary target genes, Fkbp5 (21Paakinaho V. Makkonen H. Jaaskelainen T. Palvimo J.J. Glucocorticoid receptor activates poised FKBP51 locus through long-distance interactions.Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and Sesn1 (6Kuo T. Lew M.J. Mayba O. Harris C.A. Speed T.P. Wang J.C. Genome-wide analysis of glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites in myotubes identifies gene networks modulating insulin signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 11160-11165Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). DEX treatment increased approximately 3-fold of expression of Sesn1 in WT mice. In MKO mice, similar DEX response was observed (Fig. 2B). DEX treatment elevated the expression of Fkbp5 approximately 5-fold in WT mice (Fig. 2B). The basal Fkbp5 expression was lower in MKO mice, though not statistically significant (p = 0.11). DEX treatment also efficiently increased Fkbp5 expression in MKO mice (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that depleting Pik3r1 expression did not affect general GR activity in GA muscle. WT and MKO mice treated with or without DEX for 7 days were injected with insulin for 10 min. GA muscle, liver, and epididymal white adipose tissue were isolated, and the activity of a key molecule in insulin signaling, Akt, was monitored. For Akt activity, we monitored the levels of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) at serine 473 residue (22Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. The protein kinase encoded by the Akt proto-oncogene is a target of the PDGF-activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar) and total Akt. The activity of Akt was represented by the ratio of pAkt and Akt. Insulin treatment elevated pAkt/Akt ratio in GA muscle, liver, and epididymal white adipose tissue of WT mice (Fig. 2B). In MKO mice, insulin treatment significantly increased pAkt/Akt ratio in GA muscle, liver, and epididymal white adipose tissue (Fig. 3A). We found that DEX treatment reduced Akt activity in all three tissues of WT mice (Fig. 3A). In epididymal white adipose tissue and liver of MKO mice, DEX treatment was still able to inhibit Akt activity (Fig. 3A). However, in GA muscle, the ability of DEX to reduce insulin stimulated Akt activity was significantly attenuated (Fig. 3A). These results demonstrate that Pik3r1 deficiency in striated muscle reduced the DEX effect on insulin action in GA muscle but not in other insulin responsive metabolic tissues, such as epididymal white adipose tissue and liver. To examine whether Pik3r1 deletion in striated muscle affects the ability of DEX to modulate insulin sensitivity, WT and MKO mice were treated with or without DEX for 1 week. After 15 h fasting, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed in these mice. In WT mice, DEX treatment caused glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, in MKO mice, although DEX treatment still caused hyperinsulinemia (Fig. 2D), DEX-induced glucose tolerance was significantly improved (Fig. 2D). We also performed insulin tolerance test in WT and MKO mice treated with or without DEX for 1 week. We found that DEX treatment resulted in insulin intolerance in WT mice (Fig. 3D). In MKO mice, DEX treatment still caused insulin intolerance, but to with a lesser degree (Fig. 3D). Thus, DEX effect on insulin tolerance was somewhat reduced in MKO mice (Fig. 3D). Without DEX treatment, MKO and WT mice had similar glucose and insulin tolerance and plasma insulin levels were similar (Fig. 3, B–D). These results are in agreement with the previous report (17Luo J. Sobkiw C.L. Hirshman M.F. Logsdon M.N. Li T.Q. Goodyear L.J. Cantley L.C. Loss of class IA PI3K signaling in muscle leads to impaired muscle growth, insulin response, and hyperlipidemia.Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 355-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Overall, our results demonstrate that Pik3r1 depletion in striated muscle attenuates the DEX treatment-induced glucose and insulin intolerance. To determine how DEX treatment in WT and MKO mice leads to muscle atrophy, muscle proteome–wide fractional synthesis rates were measured by LC-MS/MS after 2H2O labeling. Mice were administered DEX or PBS for 10 days followed by 2H2O labeling in drinking water for the last 7 days (23Holmes W.E. Angel T.E. Li K.W. Hellerstein M.K.

Acta. 2006; 1760: 730-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). GA muscle protein fractional synthesis criteria for each group (n ≤ 3) filtered the data set to 57 proteins common among each group. Detailed filtering criteria was further explained in the method section (23Holmes W.E. Angel T.E. Li K.W. Hellerstein M.K. Dynamic proteomics: In vivo proteome-wide measurement of protein kinetics using metabolic labeling.Methods Enzymol. 2015; 561: 219-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discover ontology analysis was employed to characterize the biochemical function and cellular localization for the proteomics data set. The proteins were grouped as either glucose metabolism (n = 16), mitochondrial (n = 16), cytoplasmic (n = 20), and myofibril proteins, (n = 5) of which, 19 individual proteins were significantly decreased by DEX after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. (Supporting Information 1). Global average GA muscle protein fraction synthesis rates are shown in WT and MKO mice GA muscle treated with PBS or DEX (represented as WT+PBS, WT+DEX, MKO + PBS and MKO + DEX, respectively, Fig. 4A). The mean GA protein fraction synthesis values were 18.0%, 13.5%, 15.2%, and 12.9% for WT+PBS, WT+DEX, MKO + PBS and MKO + DEX mice, respectively. The overall protein synthesis rate in MKO mouse GA muscle was significantly lower than that of WT mouse GA muscle (15.5% reduction (15.2%/18.0%), p ≤ 0.0001). DEX significantly reduced protein synthesis in both WT and MKO mice. However, in WT mouse GA muscle, the overall protein synthesis rate was decreased by an average of 25.1% (13.5%/18.0%), whereas in MKO mouse GA muscle, the overall protein synthesis rate was reduced by only 15.1% (12.9%/15.2%) with DEX treatment. The relative reduction in the change in GA muscle individual protein fractional synthesis rates were also compared among groups. Experimental fractional synthesis (f) values for the proteins common among each model were plotted in dot plot and sorted from low to high, and then by protein (Fig. 4B). Graphically, in WT+DEX (red line), MKO + PBS (green line), and MKO + DEX mice (purple line), most proteins exhibited a decrease in fractional synthesis as compared with WT (blue line). We then compared the percent change in each protein’s fractional synthesis for WT animals treated with or without DEX (Fig. 4C). Statistical significance was assessed by a binomial distribution of the proportion of proteins showing a negative or positive percent change in fractional synthesis with DEX treatment (Fig. 4C). In WT+DEX, 96.5% or 55/57 proteins showed lower fractional synthesis rates as compared with WT mice (Fig. 4C). Only two proteins, electron transfer flavoprotein subunit beta and peroxiredoxin-1, did not have lower fractional synthesis by DEX treatment (Supporting Information 1). Surprisingly, in MKO animals, 48/57 or 84.2% of GA muscle proteins showed lower fractional synthesis compared with WT mice (Fig. 4C). In addition, 48/57 or 84.2% of proteins in MKO mice were reduced by DEX treatment. Thus, seven proteins whose protein synthesis rates were reduced in WT mice by DEX were not affected by DEX in MKO mouse GA muscle, whereas two proteins, alpha-enolase and phosphoglycerate kinase-1, had a higher protein synthesis rate (17% and 9.4%, respectively) in MKO mice treated with DEX (Supporting Information 2). Finally, 37/57 or 64.9% of GA muscle proteins had lower fractional synthesis in WT + DEX mice compared with MKO + DEX mice, whereas 35.1% had higher fractional synthesis (p = 0.016). Overall, these results indicated that DEX effect on lowering protein synthesis was compromised without Pik3r1 in GA muscle. We also performed histological analysis (Fig. 5A) to monitor the cross-section area and fiber count of GA muscle of WT + PBS, MKO + PBS, WT + DEX, and MKO + DEX mice, asking whether DEX induced muscle histological changes are compromised in MKO mice. Cross-sectional area of GA muscle fibers significantly decreased from a mean of 2277 μm2 in WT animals to 1382 μm2 in WT + DEX mice (Fig. 5B). In MKO mice, cross-sectional area of GA muscle fibers was 1709 μm2 (Fig. 5B). This is in agreement with the lower protein synthesis rates in MKO GA muscle shown above. Importantly, there was no reduction in cross-sectional area of GA muscle fibers in MKO + DEX mice (1979 μm2) compared with MKO mice. GA muscle fiber count showed similar results. DEX treatment increased fiber count in WT GA muscle, and MKO had higher fiber count than WT mice, but DEX did not alter fiber count in MKO mice (Fig. 5C). Immunohistochemical staining was used to analyze the fiber types of GA muscle of WT and MKO mice. The antibodies against MHC I, MHC IIa, MHC IIb, and MHC IIx were used. MHC I is encoded by Myh7 and represents slow oxidative fibers, whereas MHC IIa is encoded by Myh2 and represents fast oxidative fibers (27Schiaffino S. Muscle fiber type diversity revealed by anti-myosin heavy chain antibodies.FEBS J. 2018; 285: 3688-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MHC IIb is encoded by Myh4, and MHC IIx is encoded by Myh1 and represent fast glycolytic fibers IIb and IIx, respectively (27Schiaffino S. Muscle fiber type diversity revealed by anti-myosin heavy chain antibodies.FEBS J. 2018; 285: 3688-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The fiber type composition of GA muscle of WT mice was similar to previous reports (Fig. 5D) (28Kammoun M. Cassar-Malek I. Meunier B. Picard B. A simplified immunohistochemical classification of skeletal muscle fibres in mouse.Eur. J. Histochem. 2014; 58: 2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It appears that GA muscle of MKO mice had more fast oxidative fibers, as MHC IIa levels were higher than those of WT mice (Fig. 5D). We further analyzed the DEX effect on signaling processes that regulate protein synthesis. As described above, WT and MKO mice were treated with or without DEX and were injected with insulin for 10 min before GA muscle was isolated. We first monitored the phosphorylation at threonine 389 of p70S6 kinase (S6K) (29Pullen N. Thomas G.

https://openalex.org/W3126828880,"Background The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was introduced into Thailand’s national immunization program in 2017 for 11–12 year old school girls. The objectives of this study were to examine the epidemiological consequences and cost-effectiveness of a routine quadrivalent HPV (4vHPV) vaccination and the routine 4vHPV vaccination plus 5-year catch-up vaccination by comparing with cervical cancer screening only (no vaccination) in Thailand. Method A transmission dynamic model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of the routine 4vHPV vaccination and the routine 4vHPV vaccination plus catch-up vaccination, compared with no vaccination (screening only) in Thai population. The vaccination coverage rate assumptions were 95% in 11-12-year-old girls for the routine vaccination and 70% in 13–24 year-old females for the 5-year catch-up vaccination. Vaccination costs, direct medical costs of HPV-related diseases, and the number of quality of life years (QALYs) gained were calculated for over a 100-year time horizon with discount rate of 3%. Result The model indicated that the routine 4vHPV vaccination and the routine plus catch-up 4vHPV vaccination strategies could prevent approximately 434,130 and 472,502 cumulative cases of cervical cancer, 182,234 and 199,068 cumulative deaths from cervical cancer and 12,708,349 and 13,641,398 cumulative cases of HPV 6/11 related genital warts, respectively, when compared with no vaccination over 100 years. The estimated cost per QALY gained (ICER) when compared to no vaccination in Thailand was 8,370 THB/QALY for the routine vaccination and 9,650 THB/QALY for the routine with catch-up vaccination strategy. Conclusion Considering the recommended threshold of 160,000 THB/QALY for Thailand, the implementation of the routine 4vHPV vaccination either alone or plus the catch-up vaccination was cost-effective as compared to the cervical cancer screening only."

Based on the national population, we calculated the age-standardized rate (ASR) of breast cancer between 1996 and 2015. Overall 14,222 new cases of breast cancer (13,948 women, or 98%) had been registered during the 1996–2015 period; among whom, just over half (52%) were in the 2nd stage and 26% in the 3rd and 4th stages. In women, the median age at diagnosis was 50 years and there was a slight increase over time. The ASR of breast cancer during the 2011–2015 period was 107.4 cases per 100,000 women, representing an increase of 70% compared to the rate during the 1996–2000 period. In men, there was also a significant increase in the ASR: from 1.13 during the 1996–2001 period to 2.32 per 100,000 men during the 2011–2015 period. These very first data from Vietnam suggest that although the incidence of breast cancer in Vietnam remains relatively low, it has increased over time."

Effective mass screening requires robust and sensitive tests that reliably detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections with a low viral count. Currently, the most accurate tests are based on detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR. We developed a method to process COVID-19 specimens that simplifies and increases the sensitivity of viral RNA detection by direct RT-qPCR, performed without RNA purification. In the method, termed Alkaline-Glycol Processing (AG Processing), a SARS-CoV-2-containing biological specimen, such as saliva or a swab-collected suspension, is processed at pH 12.2 to 12.8 for 5 min at room temperature. An aliquot of the AG-processed specimen is used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by direct RT-qPCR. AG processing effectively lyses viruses and reduces the effect of inhibitors of RT-PCR that are present in biological specimens. The sensitivity of detecting viral RNA using AG processing is on par with methods that include a viral RNA purification step. One copy of SARS-CoV-2 virus per reaction, equivalent to 300 copies per ml of saliva, is detectable in the AG-processed saliva. The LOD is 300 viral copies per ml of initial saliva specimen. AG processing works with saliva specimens or swab specimens collected into Universal Transport Medium, is compatible with heat treatment of saliva, and was confirmed to work with a range of CDC-approved RT-qPCR products and kits. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using AG processing with direct RT-qPCR provides a reliable and scalable diagnostic test for COVID-19 that can be integrated into a range of workflows, including automated settings."
https://openalex.org/W3026246831,"The medical applications of electrical biostimulation and silver ions have been evaluated in laboratory experiments and clinical studies for more than two decades. Their effects on preventing infection and promoting wound healing have been described. However, little is known about the role of electrical biostimulation and/or silver ion on changes in cellular transcriptome dynamics. To our knowledge, few studies have been conducted to investigate the potential of electrical biostimulation and silver ions in cell reprogramming. Besides, it is essential to assess any possible adverse effects or potential benefits of the silver ions on mammalian cells to address its safety concerns and to improve silver medical products. In this study, we investigated transcriptomic changes in porcine fibroblast cells in response to electrical biostimulation in the presence of silver ions. Exposed cells presented distinct morphological changes after treatment, which was mainly due to the exposure of silver ions rather than the electrical current itself. Gene expression analyses suggested that electrical biostimulation and silver ions did not increase the expression of pluripotency genes. Interestingly, a set of genes related to cellular metabolic processes were differentially expressed after cells were exposed to electrically generated silver ions for 21 hours. We found that 2.00 mg/L of electrically generated silver ion caused an increase of ATP generation and an increase of the total pool of NAD + and NADH, while ROS production did not change. Aside from toxic effects, the results reported herein demonstrate the alternative effects of silver ions on mammalian cells, especially an oxidative phosphorylation burst. To our knowledge, this response of mammalian cells to silver ions has not been described previously. Although the function of this burst is not understood, it may lead to alterations in cellular activities such as metabolic remodeling and cell reprogramming, and/or serve an as-yet unknown function in neutralization or detoxification of the silver ions within the cells."
https://openalex.org/W3126518286,"We have shown that nitric oxide limits ataxia-telangiectasia mutated signaling by inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in a β-cell selective manner. In this study, we examined the actions of nitric oxide on a second DNA damage response transducer kinase, ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR). In β-cells and non-β-cells, nitric oxide activates ATR signaling by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase; however, when produced at inducible nitric oxide synthase-derived (low micromolar) levels, nitric oxide impairs ATR signaling in a β-cell selective manner. The inhibitory actions of nitric oxide are associated with impaired mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and lack of glycolytic compensation that result in a decrease in β-cell ATP. Like nitric oxide, inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration reduce ATP levels and limit ATR signaling in a β-cell selective manner. When non-β-cells are forced to utilize mitochondrial oxidative metabolism for ATP generation, their response is more like β-cells, as nitric oxide and inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration attenuate ATR signaling. These studies support a dual role for nitric oxide in regulating ATR signaling. Nitric oxide activates ATR in all cell types examined by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, and in a β-cell selective manner, inducible nitric oxide synthase-derived levels of nitric oxide limit ATR signaling by attenuating mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and depleting ATP."
https://openalex.org/W3127265447,"Neural spike sorting is prerequisite to deciphering useful information from electrophysiological data recorded from the brain, in vitro and/or in vivo. Significant advancements in nanotechnology and nanofabrication has enabled neuroscientists and engineers to capture the electrophysiological activities of the brain at very high resolution, data rate and fidelity. However, the evolution in spike sorting algorithms to deal with the aforementioned technological advancement and capability to quantify higher density data sets is somewhat limited. Both supervised and unsupervised clustering algorithms do perform well when the data to quantify is small, however, their efficiency degrades with the increase in the data size in terms of processing time and quality of spike clusters being formed. This makes neural spike sorting an inefficient process to deal with large and dense electrophysiological data recorded from brain. The presented work aims to address this challenge by providing a novel data pre-processing framework, which can enhance the efficiency of the conventional spike sorting algorithms significantly. The proposed framework is validated by applying on ten widely used algorithms and six large feature sets. Feature sets are calculated by employing PCA and Haar wavelet features on three widely adopted large electrophysiological datasets for consistency during the clustering process. A MATLAB software of the proposed mechanism is also developed and provided to assist the researchers, active in this domain."
https://openalex.org/W3127861441,"Despite decades of research on adolescent friendships, little is known about adolescents who are more likely to form ties outside of school. We examine multiple social and ecological contexts including parents, the school, social networks, and the neighborhood to understand the origins and health significance of out of school ties using survey data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health ( N = 81,674). Findings indicate that out of school (more than in-school) friendships drive adolescent deviance and alcohol use, and youth with such friends tend to be involved in school activities and are central among their peer group. This suggests that intervention efforts aimed at reducing deviance and underage drinking may benefit from engaging youth with spanning social ties."
https://openalex.org/W3128578615,"Successful intrauterine hematopoietic cell transplantation (IUT) for congenital hemoglobinopathies is hampered by maternal alloresponsiveness. We investigate these interactions in semi-allogenic murine IUT. E14 fetuses (B6 females × BALB/c males) were each treated with 5E+6 maternal (B6) or paternal (BALB/c) bone marrow cells and serially monitored for chimerism (>1% engraftment), trafficked maternal immune cells, and immune responsiveness to donor cells. A total of 41.0% of maternal IUT recipients (mIUT) were chimeras (mean donor chimerism 3.0 ± 1.3%) versus 75.0% of paternal IUT recipients (pIUT, 3.6 ± 1.1%). Chimeras showed higher maternal microchimerism of CD4, CD8, and CD19 than non-chimeras. These maternal cells showed minimal responsiveness to B6 or BALB/c stimulation. To interrogate tolerance, mIUT were injected postnatally with 5E+6 B6 cells/pup; pIUT received BALB/c cells. IUT-treated pups showed no changes in trafficked maternal or fetal immune cell levels compared to controls. Donor-specific IgM and IgG were expressed by 1%-3% of recipients. mIUT splenocytes showed greater proliferation of regulatory T cells (Treg) upon BALB/c stimulation, while B6 stimulation upregulated the pro-inflammatory cytokines more than BALB/c. pIUT splenocytes produced identical Treg and cytokine responses to BALB/c and B6 cells, with higher Treg activity and lower pro-inflammatory cytokine expression upon exposure to BALB/c. In contrast, naïve fetal splenocytes demonstrated greater alloresponsiveness to BALB/c compared to B6 cells. Thus pIUT, associated with increased maternal cell trafficking, modulates fetal Treg, and cytokine responsiveness to donor cells more efficiently than mIUT, resulting in improved engraftment. Paternal donor cells may be considered alternatively to maternal donor cells for intrauterine and postnatal transplantation to induce tolerance and maintain engraftment."
https://openalex.org/W3126471450,"Purpose The aim of this study was to assess the impact of cataract progression using the Haigis formula-calculated intraocular lens (IOL) power and investigate the accuracy of IOL power measured at different time points. Methods This prospective study was performed on 75 eyes of 75 patients who underwent uneventful cataract surgery. Preoperative ocular parameters including axial length (AL), keratometry (K), anterior chamber depth (ACD), corneal astigmatism, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) examined at the two time points, more than 3 months preoperatively and preoperative 1 day were compared. The ocular parameters measured in the two time points were used to calculate the predicted implanted IOL power and the actual IOL power was chosen on the basis of parameters measured earlier before surgery using the Haigis formula. The mean numerical error (MNE) and mean absolute error (MAE) predicted by the two time points were also compared. Results There were significant differences in the ACD, IOL power, UDVA and CDVA (P&lt;0.01), but no statistical differences in AL, mean K and corneal astigmatism (P&gt;0.05) during the average of 5.6 months before surgery. No statistically significant difference was detected in MNE (P&gt;0.05), while the MAE had a significant difference in the two time points (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion The IOL power measured earlier before surgery might result in a higher accuracy and the postoperative refractive outcome tended towards emmetropia."
https://openalex.org/W3128065993,"Among cancer treatment methods, targeted therapy using cancer-associated biomarkers has minimum side effects. Recently olfactory receptor (OR) family attracts the researcher’s attention as a favorable biomarker of cancer. Here, a statistical approach using complete data from the human protein atlas database was used to evaluate the potential of OR51J1 gene as a cancer-associated biomarker. To confirm the findings of statistical analysis, the OR51J1 mRNA and protein expression levels in breast tumor and normal tissue were measured using quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques. The association with clinicopathological factors was analyzed. Statistical analysis revealed that OR51J1 has a high expression level in more than 20 types of cancer tissues without any expression in 44 normal tissues. In 15 cancer types, including breast cancer, expression score was more than 90%. The qRT-PCR analysis in breast cancer showed OR51J1 have significantly higher expression level in tumors than normal tissues (2.91 fold). The IHC results showed OR51J1 expression on other cellular subtypes than tumor and normal cells, including myoepithelium, fibroblast, and lymphocytes. OR51J1 protein expression in invasive cells, as well as its overall score, showed a significant correlation with ER and PR expression and breast cancer (BC) subtypes. Results revealed the potential of OR51J1 as a cancer-associated biomarker for the diagnosis of breast cancer at the mRNA level."
