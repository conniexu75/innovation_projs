https://openalex.org/W1986234964,"Only a small proportion of the mouse genome is transcribed into mature messenger RNA transcripts. There is an international collaborative effort to identify all full-length mRNA transcripts from the mouse, and to ensure that each is represented in a physical collection of clones. Here we report the manual annotation of 60,770 full-length mouse complementary DNA sequences. These are clustered into 33,409 'transcriptional units', contributing 90.1% of a newly established mouse transcriptome database. Of these transcriptional units, 4,258 are new protein-coding and 11,665 are new non-coding messages, indicating that non-coding RNA is a major component of the transcriptome. 41% of all transcriptional units showed evidence of alternative splicing. In protein-coding transcripts, 79% of splice variations altered the protein product. Whole-transcriptome analyses resulted in the identification of 2,431 sense-antisense pairs. The present work, completely supported by physical clones, provides the most comprehensive survey of a mammalian transcriptome so far, and is a valuable resource for functional genomics."
https://openalex.org/W2168815228,"Recent physiological studies of alert primates have revealed cortical neural correlates of key steps in a perceptual decision-making process. To elucidate synaptic mechanisms of decision making, I investigated a biophysically realistic cortical network model for a visual discrimination experiment. In the model, slow recurrent excitation and feedback inhibition produce attractor dynamics that amplify the difference between conflicting inputs and generates a binary choice. The model is shown to account for salient characteristics of the observed decision-correlated neural activity, as well as the animal's psychometric function and reaction times. These results suggest that recurrent excitation mediated by NMDA receptors provides a candidate cellular mechanism for the slow time integration of sensory stimuli and the formation of categorical choices in a decision-making neocortical network."
https://openalex.org/W1995004764,"Endurance exercise induces increases in mitochondria and the GLUT4 isoform of the glucose transporter in muscle. Although little is known about the mechanisms underlying these adaptations, new information has accumulated regarding how mitochondrial biogenesis and GLUT4 expression are regulated. This includes the findings that the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and that NRF-1 and NRF-2 act as transcriptional activators of genes encoding mitochondrial enzymes. We tested the hypothesis that increases in PGC-1, NRF-1, and NRF-2 are involved in the initial adaptive response of muscle to exercise. Five daily bouts of swimming induced increases in mitochondrial enzymes and GLUT4 in skeletal muscle in rats. One exercise bout resulted in approximately twofold increases in full-length muscle PGC-1 mRNA and PGC-1 protein, which were evident 18 h after exercise. A smaller form of PGC-1 increased after exercise. The exercise induced increases in muscle NRF-1 and NRF-2 that were evident 12 to 18 h after one exercise bout. These findings suggest that increases in PGC-1, NRF-1, and NRF-2 represent key regulatory components of the stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by exercise and that PGC-1 mediates the coordinated increases in GLUT4 and mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2162772229,"Neuronal activity influences myelination of the brain, but the molecular mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Here, we report that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) express functional adenosine receptors, which are activated in response to action potential firing. Adenosine acts as a potent neuron-glial transmitter to inhibit OPC proliferation, stimulate differentiation, and promote the formation of myelin. This neuron-glial signal provides a molecular mechanism for promoting oligodendrocyte development and myelination in response to impulse activity and may help resolve controversy on the opposite effects of impulse activity on myelination in the central and peripheral nervous systems."
https://openalex.org/W2159198041,"The visual system adapts to the magnitude of intensity fluctuations, and this process begins in the retina. Following the switch from a low-contrast environment to one of high contrast, ganglion cell sensitivity declines in two distinct phases: a fast change occurs in <0.1 s, and a slow decrease over approximately 10 s. To examine where these modulations arise, we recorded intracellularly from every major cell type in the salamander retina. Certain bipolar and amacrine cells, and all ganglion cells, adapted to contrast. Generally, these neurons showed both fast and slow adaptation. Fast effects of a contrast increase included accelerated kinetics, decreased sensitivity, and a depolarization of the baseline membrane potential. Slow adaptation did not affect kinetics, but produced a gradual hyperpolarization. This hyperpolarization can account for slow adaptation in the spiking output of ganglion cells."
https://openalex.org/W2054493687,"Most inbred laboratory mouse strains are known to have originated from a mixed but limited founder population in a few laboratories. However, the effect of this breeding history on patterns of genetic variation among these strains and the implications for their use are not well understood. Here we present an analysis of the fine structure of variation in the mouse genome, using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). When the recently assembled genome sequence from the C57BL/6J strain is aligned with sample sequence from other strains, we observe long segments of either extremely high (approximately 40 SNPs per 10 kb) or extremely low (approximately 0.5 SNPs per 10 kb) polymorphism rates. In all strain-to-strain comparisons examined, only one-third of the genome falls into long regions (averaging >1 Mb) of a high SNP rate, consistent with estimated divergence rates between Mus musculus domesticus and either M. m. musculus or M. m. castaneus. These data suggest that the genomes of these inbred strains are mosaics with the vast majority of segments derived from domesticus and musculus sources. These observations have important implications for the design and interpretation of positional cloning experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2068004114,"The development of nontoxic natural agents with chemopreventive activity against colon cancer is the focus of investigation in many laboratories. Curcumin (feruylmethane), a natural plant product, possesses such chemopreventive activity, but the mechanisms by which it prevents cancer growth are not well understood. In the present study, we examined the mechanisms by which curcumin treatment affects the growth of colon cancer cells in vitro. Results showed that curcumin treatment causes p53- and p21-independent G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in HCT-116(p53+/+), HCT-116(p53−/−) and HCT-116(p21−/−) cell lines. We further investigated the association of the β-catenin-mediated c-Myc expression and the cell–cell adhesion pathways in curcumin-induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis in HCT-116 cells. Results described a caspase-3-mediated cleavage of β-catenin, decreased transactivation of β-catenin/Tcf-Lef, decreased promoter DNA binding activity of the β-catenin/Tcf-Lef complex, and decreased levels of c-Myc protein. These activities were linked with decreased Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase activity, a function of the G2/M phase arrest. The decreased transactivation of β-catenin in curcumin-treated HCT-116 cells was unpreventable by caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk, even though the curcumin-induced cleavage of β-catenin was blocked in Z-DEVD-fmk pretreated cells. The curcumin treatment also induced caspase-3-mediated degradation of cell–cell adhesion proteins β-catenin, E-cadherin and APC, which were linked with apoptosis, and this degradation was prevented with the caspase-3 inhibitor. Our results suggest that curcumin treatment impairs both Wnt signaling and cell–cell adhesion pathways, resulting in G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in HCT-116 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2000193607,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and malignant central nervous system tumor in humans, is highly proliferative and resistant to apoptosis. Stat3, a latent transcription factor being activated by aberrant cytokine or growth factor signaling, acts as a suppressor of apoptosis in a number of cancer cells. Here we report that GBM tumors and cell lines contain high levels of constitutively activated Stat3 when compared with normal human astrocytes, white matter, and normal tissue adjacent to tumor. The persistent activation of Stat3 is in part, attributable to an autocrine action of interleukin-6 in the GBM cell line U251. Janus kinase inhibitor AG490 inhibits Stat3 activation with a concomitant reduction in steady-state levels of Bcl-X(L), Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins and induces apoptosis in U251 cells as revealed by Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and Annexin-V staining. Expression of a dominant negative mutant Stat3 protein or treatment with AG490 markedly reduces the proliferation of U251 cells by inhibiting the constitutive activation of Stat3. These results provide evidence that constitutive activation of Stat3 contributes to the pathogenesis of glioblastoma by promoting both proliferation and survival of GBM cells. Therefore, targeting Stat3 signaling may provide a potential therapeutic intervention for GBM."

https://openalex.org/W1963551844,"To characterize Ca2+-mediated synaptic vesicle fusion, we analyzed Drosophila synaptotagmin I mutants deficient in specific interactions mediated by its two Ca2+ binding C2 domains. In the absence of synaptotagmin I, synchronous release is abolished and a kinetically distinct delayed asynchronous release pathway is uncovered. Synapses containing only the C2A domain of synaptotagmin partially recover synchronous fusion, but have an abolished Ca2+ cooperativity. Mutants that disrupt Ca2+ sensing by the C2B domain have synchronous release with normal Ca2+ cooperativity, but with reduced release probability. Our data suggest the Ca2+ cooperativity of neurotransmitter release is likely mediated through synaptotagmin-SNARE interactions, while phospholipid binding and oligomerization trigger rapid fusion with increased release probability. These results indicate that synaptotagmin is the major Ca2+ sensor for evoked release and functions to trigger synchronous fusion in response to Ca2+, while suppressing asynchronous release."
https://openalex.org/W2110233724,"The murine genome contains ∼70 protocadherin (Pcdh) genes. Many are expressed in the nervous system, suggesting that Pcdhs may specify neuronal connectivity. Here, we analyze the 22 contiguous genes of the Pcdh-γ cluster. Individual neurons express subsets of Pcdh-γ genes. Pcdh-γ proteins are present in most neurons and associated with, but not confined to, synapses. Early steps in neuronal migration, axon outgrowth, and synapse formation proceed in mutant mice lacking all 22 Pcdh-γ genes. At late embryonic stages, however, dramatic neurodegeneration leads to neonatal death. In mutant spinal cord, many interneurons are lost, but sensory and motor neurons are relatively spared. In cultures from mutant spinal cord, neurons differentiate and form synapses but then die. Thus, Pcdh-γ genes are dispensable for at least some aspects of connectivity but required for survival of specific neuronal types."
https://openalex.org/W2011546287,"Phototransduction relies on the precise balance of speed and sensitivity to achieve optimal performance. The cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels, with their Ca(2+) permeability, high sensitivity to changes in cytosolic cGMP, rapid gating kinetics, and Ca(2+)-calmodulin modulation, are beautifully optimized for their role in light detection. Many of these specializations come about from the heteromeric composition of the native channel, comprised of CNGA1 and CNGB1 subunits. However, the stoichiometry and arrangement of these subunits is unknown. Here we have used an approach based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to determine the composition of the intact functional channel in the surface membrane. We find, surprisingly, that the channel contains three CNGA1 subunits and only one CNGB1 subunit. These results have implications for CNG channel function in particular and assembly of membrane proteins in general."
https://openalex.org/W2006717761,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) from platelets and macrophages stimulates migration and enhances survival of T cells. Mouse spleen CD4 and CD8 T cells are shown to express predominantly S1P1 (Edg-1) and S1P4 (Edg-6) G-protein-coupled receptors with only minimal representation of S1P2, S1P3, and S1P5. At and below plasma concentrations of healthy mammals (1 nM-1 microM), S1P evokes trans-Matrigel chemotaxis of mouse CD4 and CD8 T cells and recruits T cells into subcutaneous air pouches. T cell receptor-mediated activation of CD4 T cells suppresses expression of S1P1 and S1P4 receptors and eliminates their chemotactic responses to S1P. The immunoregulator FTY720, a structural homologue of S1P, lacks T cell chemotactic activity and competitively inhibits T cell chemotactic responses to S1P in vitro and in vivo. S1P may be a distinctive contributor to compartmental immunity by attracting naïve and memory T cells preferentially over activated effector T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2109590258,"Behavioral conditioned immunosuppression has been described in rodents as the most impressive demonstration of brain-to-immune system interaction. To analyze whether behavioral conditioned immunosuppression is possible in humans, healthy subjects in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study were conditioned in four sessions over 3 consecutive days, receiving the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A as an unconditioned stimulus paired with a distinctively flavored drink (conditioned stimulus) each 12 h. In the next week, re-exposure to the conditioned stimulus (drink), but now paired with placebo capsules, induced a suppression of immune functions as analyzed by the IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA expression, intracellular production, and in vitro release of IL-2 and IFN-gamma, as well as lymphocyte proliferation. These data demonstrate for the first time that immunosuppression can be behaviorally conditioned in humans."

https://openalex.org/W1965083271,"The primary motor cortex (MI) is regarded as the site for motor control. Occasional reports that MI neurons react to sensory stimuli have either been ignored or attributed to guidance of voluntary movements. Here, we show that MI activation is necessary for the somatic perception of movement of our limbs. We made use of an illusion: when the wrist tendon of one hand is vibrated, it is perceived as the hand moving. If the vibrated hand has skin contact with the other hand, it is perceived as both hands bending. Using fMRI and TMS, we show that the activation in MI controlling the nonvibrated hand is compulsory for the somatic perception of the hand movement. This novel function of MI contrasts with its traditional role as the executive locus of voluntary limb movement."

https://openalex.org/W2064726682,"We demonstrate a noninvasive technique for protein photoinactivation using a transgenically encoded tag. A tetracysteine motif that binds the membrane-permeable fluorescein derivative 4',5'-bis(1,3,2-dithioarsolan-2-yl)fluorescein (FlAsH) was engineered into synaptotagmin I (Syt I4C). Neuronally expressed Syt I4C rescues the syt I null mutation, can be visualized after FlAsH labeling, and is normally distributed at the Drosophila neuromuscular synapse. Illumination of FlAsH bound Syt I4C at 488 nm decreases evoked release in seconds demonstrating efficient fluorophore-assisted light inactivation (FlAsH-FALI) of Syt I. The inactivation of Syt I is proportional to the duration of illumination and follows first-order kinetics. In addition, Syt I FlAsH-FALI is specific and does not impair Syt I-independent vesicle fusion. We demonstrate that Syt I is required for a post-docking step during vesicle fusion but does not function to stabilize the docked vesicle state."
https://openalex.org/W2011301782,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels play a central role in the conversion of sensory stimuli into electrical signals. CNG channels form heterooligomeric complexes built of A and B subunits. Here, we study the subunit stoichiometry of the native rod CNG channel by chemical crosslinking. The apparent molecular weight (M(w)) of each crosslink product was determined by SDS-PAGE, and its composition was analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for the A1 or B1 subunit. The number of crosslink products and their M(w) as well as the immunological identification of A1 and B1 subunits in the crosslink products led us to conclude that the native rod CNG channel is a tetramer composed of three A1 and one B1 subunit. This is an example of violation of symmetry in tetrameric channels."
https://openalex.org/W2090508938,"The C. elegans polymodal ASH sensory neurons detect mechanical, osmotic, and chemical stimuli and release glutamate to signal avoidance responses. To investigate the mechanisms of this polymodal signaling, we have characterized the role of postsynaptic glutamate receptors in mediating the response to these distinct stimuli. By studying the behavioral and electrophysiological properties of worms defective for non-NMDA (GLR-1 and GLR-2) and NMDA (NMR-1) receptor subunits, we show that while the osmotic avoidance response requires both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors, the response to mechanical stimuli only requires non-NMDA receptors. Furthermore, analysis of the EGL-3 proprotein convertase provides additional evidence that polymodal signaling in C. elegans occurs via the differential activation of postsynaptic glutamate receptor subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2019343236,"Quaking viable (qk(v)) mice fail to properly compact myelin in their central nervous systems. Although the defect in the qk(v) mice involves a mutation affecting the expression of the alternatively spliced qk gene products, their roles in myelination are unknown. We show that the QKI RNA binding proteins regulate the nuclear export of MBP mRNAs. Disruption of the QKI nucleocytoplasmic equilibrium in oligodendrocytes results in nuclear and perikaryal retention of the MBP mRNAs and lack of export to cytoplasmic processes, as it occurs in qk(v) mice. MBP mRNA export defect leads to a reduction in the MBP levels and their improper cellular targeting to the periphery. Our findings suggest that QKI participates in myelination by regulating the mRNA export of key protein components."
https://openalex.org/W2023634624,"BtuF is the periplasmic binding protein (PBP) for the vitamin B12 transporter BtuCD, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily of transmembrane pumps. We have determined crystal structures of Escherichia coli BtuF in the apo state at 3.0 A resolution and with vitamin B12 bound at 2.0 A resolution. The structure of BtuF is similar to that of the FhuD and TroA PBPs and is composed of two alpha/beta domains linked by a rigid alpha-helix. B12 is bound in the or vitamin conformation in a wide acidic cleft located between these domains. The C-terminal domain shares structural homology to a B12-binding domain found in a variety of enzymes. The same surface of this domain interacts with opposite surfaces of B12 when comparing ligand-bound structures of BtuF and the homologous enzymes, a change that is probably caused by the obstruction of the face that typically interacts with this domain by the base-on conformation of vitamin B12 bound to BtuF. There is no apparent pseudo-symmetry in the surface properties of the BtuF domains flanking its B12 binding site even though the presumed transport site in the previously reported crystal structure of BtuCD is located in an intersubunit interface with 2-fold symmetry. Unwinding of an alpha-helix in the C-terminal domain of BtuF appears to be part of conformational change involving a general increase in the mobility of this domain in the apo structure compared with the B12-bound structure. As this helix is located on the surface likely to interact with BtuC, unwinding of the helix upon binding to BtuC could play a role in triggering release of B12 into the transport cavity. Furthermore, the high mobility of this domain in free BtuF could provide an entropic driving force for the subsequent release of BtuF required to complete the transport cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1970833195,"β-catenin signaling may contribute to prostate cancer (CaP) progression. Although β-catenin is known to upregulate T cell factor (TCF) target gene expression in CaP cells, recent evidence demonstrates its capacity to enhance ligand-dependent androgen receptor (AR) function. Thus, we wished to further understand the interaction between these two pathways. We find in both CaP cells (CWR22-Rv1, LAPC-4, DU145) and non-CaP cells (HEK-293, TSU, SW480, HCT-116) that β-catenin/TCF-related transcription (CRT), as measured by activation of a synthetic promoter and that of cyclin D1, is inhibited by androgen treatment. This inhibition is AR-dependent, as it only occurs in cells expressing AR endogenously or transiently, and is abrogated by AR antagonists. Additional analyses convey that the ligand-dependent nature of CRT suppression depends on transactivation-competent AR in the nucleus, but not on indirect effects stemming from AR target gene expression. Given the recent work identifying an AR/β-catenin interaction, and from our finding that liganded AR does not prompt gross changes in the constitutive nuclear localization of TCF4 or mutant β-catenin, we hypothesized that transcription factor (i.e. AR and TCF) competition for β-catenin recruitment may explain, in part, androgen-induced suppression of CRT. To address this idea, we expressed an AR mutant lacking its DNA-binding domain (DBD). This receptor could not orchestrate ligand-dependent CRT repression, thereby providing support for those recent data implicating the AR DBD/LBD as necessary for β-catenin interaction. Further supporting this hypothesis, TCF/LEF over-expression counteracts androgen-induced suppression of CRT, and requires β-catenin binding activity to do so. Interestingly, TCF4 over-expression potently antagonizes AR function; however, this inhibition may occur independently of β-catenin/TCF4 interaction. These results from TCF4 over-expression analyses, taken together, provide further evidence that AR-mediated suppression of CRT is a consequence of limiting amounts of β-catenin, and not AR target gene expression. Our analyses point to a reciprocal balance between AR and CRT function that may shape critical processes during normal prostate development and tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2094622904,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome characterized by seizures, mental retardation, autism, and tumors of the brain, kidney, heart, retina, and skin. TSC is caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2, both of which are tumor suppressor genes. Hamartin, the protein product of TSC1, was found to interact with the ezrin-radixin-moesin family of cytoskeletal proteins and to activate the small GTPase Rho. To determine whether tuberin, the TSC2 product, can also activate Rho, we stably expressed full-length human tuberin in two cell types: MDCK cells and ELT3 cells. ELT3 cells lack endogenous tuberin expression. We found that expression of human tuberin in both MDCK and ELT3 cells was associated with an increase in the amount of Rho-GTP, but not in Rac1-GTP or cdc42-GTP. Tuberin expression increased cell adhesion in both cell types, and decreased chemotactic cell migration in ELT3 cells. In MDCK cells, there was a decrease in the amount of total Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) and an increase in the fraction of phosphorylated FAK. These findings demonstrate for the first time that tuberin activates Rho and regulates cell adhesion and migration. Pathways involving Rho activation may have relevance to the clinical manifestations of TSC, including pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis."

https://openalex.org/W2029260048,"Visual experience before eye-opening is not usually thought to have any developmental significance. Here we show that naturalistic visual stimuli presented through unopened eyelids robustly activate neurons in the ferret dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Further, dark-rearing prior to natural eye-opening has striking effects upon geniculate physiology. Receptive field maps after dark-rearing show increased convergence of On- and Off-center responses, and neurons frequently respond to both bright and dark phases of drifting gratings. There is also increased selectivity for the orientation of the gratings. These abnormalities of On-Off segregation can be explained by the finding that the responses of immature On and Off cells to naturalistic stimuli are strongly anticorrelated."
https://openalex.org/W2160085334,"Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are organized into an orientation map consisting of orientation domains arranged radially around “pinwheel centers” at which the representations of all orientations converge. We have combined optical imaging of intrinsic signals with intracellular recordings to estimate the subthreshold inputs and spike outputs of neurons located near pinwheel centers or in orientation domains. We find that neurons near pinwheel centers have subthreshold responses to all stimulus orientations but spike responses to only a narrow range of orientations. Across the map, the selectivity of inputs covaries with the selectivity of orientations in the local cortical network, while the selectivity of spike outputs does not. Thus, the input-output transformation performed by V1 neurons is powerfully influenced by the local structure of the orientation map."
https://openalex.org/W2057203083,"Receptive field properties of visual cortical neurons depend on the spatiotemporal context within which the stimuli are presented. We have examined the temporal context dependence of cortical orientation tuning using dynamic visual stimuli with rapidly changing orientations. We found that tuning to the orientation of the test stimulus depended on a briefly presented preceding stimulus, with the preferred orientation shifting away from the preceding orientation. Analyses of the spatial-phase dependence of the shift showed that the effect cannot be explained by purely feedforward mechanisms, but can be accounted for by activity-dependent changes in the recurrent interactions between different orientation columns. Thus, short-term plasticity of the intracortical circuit can mediate dynamic modification of orientation tuning, which may be important for efficient visual coding."
https://openalex.org/W2317059134,"The transcription factor Ets-1 regulates the expression of several angiogenic and extracellular matrix remodeling factors, and might be implicated in disease progression of breast cancer. In the present study, the prognostic value of Ets-1 expression was assessed by quantitative real-time fluorescence RT-PCR in 123 sporadic primary breast cancer samples of patients with a median follow-up time of 62 months. Ets-1 expression levels correlated significantly with VEGF and PAI-1 in the same tissue. In univariate (P=0.0011) and multivariate (P=0.005) analyses, Ets-1 expression showed significant prognostic value for relapse-free survival. Ets-1 is a strong, independent predictor of poor prognosis in breast cancer. This seems - at least in part - to be attributable to its role in transcriptional regulation of factors involved in angiogenesis (VEGF), and extracellular matrix remodeling (PAI-1)."
https://openalex.org/W2068101402,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is a nuclear receptor whose activation regulates metabolism and inflammation. Recent data indicate that the zinc finger transcription factor early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) acts as a master switch for the inflammatory response in ischemic vessels. Experiments tested the hypothesis that activation of endogenous PPAR-gamma inhibits induction of Egr-1. Egr-1 is rapidly induced in murine lungs after ischemia-reperfusion, as well as in alveolar mononuclear phagocytes deprived of oxygen as an ischemic model. In vitro, the natural PPAR-gamma ligand (15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2) and a PPAR-gamma activator (troglitazone), but not a PPAR-alpha activator (bezafibrate), strikingly diminished Egr-1 mRNA and protein expression and nuclear DNA binding activity corresponding to Egr-1. In vivo, treatment with troglitazone before ischemia prevented induction of Egr-1 and its target genes such as interleukin-1beta, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2. As a consequence of PPAR-gamma activation, pulmonary leukostasis was decreased and oxygenation and overall survival were improved. Activation of PPAR-gamma suppresses activation of Egr-1 and its inflammatory gene targets and provides potent protection against ischemic pulmonary injury. These data reveal a new mechanism whereby PPAR-gamma activation may decrease tissue inflammation in response to an ischemic insult."

https://openalex.org/W2122677203,"Base excision repair is the main pathway for repair of oxidative base lesions in DNA. Mammalian cells must maintain genomic stability in their nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, which have different degrees of vulnerability to DNA damage. This study quantifies DNA glycosylase activity in mitochondria and nucleus from C57/BL 6 mouse tissues including brain, liver, heart, muscle, kidney, and testis. The activities of oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), uracil DNA glycosylase, and endonuclease III homologue 1 (NTH1) were measured using oligonucleotide substrates with DNA lesions specific for each glycosylase. Mitochondrial content was normalized to citrate synthase activity and mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity. In nuclear and mitochondrial extracts, the highest DNA glycosylase activities were in testis. Brain and heart, tissues with the highest oxidative load, did not have higher levels of OGG1 or NTH1 activity than muscle or kidney, which are more glycolytic tissues. In general, mitochondrial extracts have lower DNA glycosylase activity than nuclear extracts. There was no correlation between glycosylase activities in the mitochondrial extracts and COX activity, suggesting that DNA repair enzymes may be regulated by a mechanism different from this mitochondrial enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2029012584,"The helix-loop-helix protein Id-1 has been suggested to play a positive role in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis of many types of human cancers. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism involved in the function of Id-1. In this study, using four stable Id-1 transfectant clones, we investigated the involvement of MAPK signaling pathway in the Id-1 induced serum independent prostate cancer cell growth. Our results demonstrated that both transient and stable ectopic Id-1 expression in prostate cancer LNCaP cells led to activation of the Raf/MEK1/2 signaling pathway. In addition, inhibition of MEK1/2 phosphorylation by one of its inhibitors, PD098059, resulted in the decreased cell cycle S phase fraction and cell growth rate, suggesting that activation of MAPK signaling pathway is essential for Id-1 induced prostate cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, treatment with antisense oligonucleotide complementary to Id-1 mRNA in PC-3 and DU145 cells resulted in a decreased Id-1 expression which was accompanied by decreased Egr-1 protein. Our results suggest for the first time that the function of Id-1 is associated with MAPK signaling pathway activation and indicate a possible novel mechanism in which Id-1 regulates prostate cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2314930926,"During the last decade, several novel members of the Epidermal Growth Factor family of peptide growth factors have been identified. Most prominent among these are the Neuregulins or Heregulins. To date, four different Neuregulin genes have been identified (Neuregulin1-4) and several different splicing isoforms have been identified for at least two of these genes (Neuregulin1 and Neuregulin2). While Neuregulin1 isoforms have been extensively studied, comparatively little is known about Neuregulin3, Neuregulin4, or the Neuregulin2 isoforms. Indeed, there has been no systematic comparison of the activities of these molecules. Here we demonstrate that Neuregulin2alpha and Neuregulin2beta stimulate ErbB3 tyrosine phosphorylation and coupling to biological responses. In contrast, Neuregulin3 and Neuregulin4 fail to activate ErbB3 signaling. Furthermore, Neuregulin2beta, but not Neuregulin2alpha, stimulates ErbB4 tyrosine phosphorylation and coupling to biological responses. Finally, both Neuregulin3 and Neuregulin4 stimulate modest amounts of ErbB4 tyrosine phosphorylation. However, whereas Neuregulin3 stimulates a modest amount of ErbB4 coupling to biological responses, Neuregulin4 fails to stimulate ErbB4 coupling to biological responses. This suggests that there are qualitative as well as quantitative differences in ErbB family receptor activation by Neuregulin isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1993702591,"Events that contribute to tumor formation include mutations in the ras gene and loss or inactivation of cell cycle inhibitors such as p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1). In our previous publication, we showed that mice expressing the MMTV/v-Ha-ras transgene developed tumors earlier and at higher multiplicities in the absence than in the presence of p21(Cip1). To further evaluate the combinatorial role of genetic alterations and loss of cell cycle inhibitors in tumorigenesis, we performed two companion studies. In the first study, wild type and p21(Cip1)-null mice were exposed to the chemical carcinogen, urethane. Similar to its effects in v-Ha-ras mice, loss of p21(Cip1) accelerated tumor onset and increased tumor multiplicity in urethane-treated mice. Lung tumors were the predominant tumor type in urethane-treated mice regardless of p21(Cip1) status. In the second study, tumor formation was monitored in v-Ha-ras mice expressing or lacking p27(Kip1). Unlike p21(Cip1), the absence of p27(Kip1) had no effect on the timing or multiplicity of tumor formation, which was largely restricted to mammary and salivary glands. However, once tumors appeared, they grew faster in p27(Kip1)-null mice than in p27(Kip1)-wild type mice. Increases in growth rate were particularly striking for salivary tumors in ras/p27(-/-) mice. Loss of p21(Cip1), on the other hand, had no effect on tumor growth rate in v-Ha-ras mice. Collectively, our data suggest that p21(Cip1) suppresses tumor formation elicited by multiple agents and that p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) suppress tumor formation in different ways."

https://openalex.org/W2329191693,"We have previously reported that the key apoptosis related gene caspase 8 (CASP8) is frequently silenced in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumors and cell lines usually, but not always, by aberrant promoter methylation. Because CASP8 is a key component of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) when specific death receptors (including DR4, DR5, FAS) are activated by their specific ligands (TRAIL/FASL), we examined expression of the components of the DISC complex in lung cancer cell lines. MYC family members are frequently amplified (MYC+ve) in SCLC, and MYC is a potent inducer of apoptosis. We examined 34 SCLC lines (12 of which were MYC+ve) and 22 NSCLC lines. CASP8 gene expression was frequently lost (79%) at message and protein levels in SCLC but not in non-SCLC (NSCLC). MYC amplification was present in 45% of SCLC cell lines, which had lost CASP8 expression, but not in any of the CASP8 positive lines. The frequency of CASP8 loss was significantly higher in MYC+ve SCLC compared to MYC−ve SCLC or in NSCLC. Analyses of other DISC components showed significantly higher rates of loss of expression of CASP10, DR5, FAS and FASL in SCLC compared to NSCLC. The loss of expression of proapoptotic DISC components was significantly higher in MYC+ve SCLC cell lines and these lines were completely resistant to TRAIL. Expression of CASP10 (a caspase closely related to CASP8) was frequently absent at the protein level in both SCLC and NSCLC lines. Expression of c-FLIP (proteolytically inactive homolog of CASP8) was inversely related to expression of CASP8. Our major conclusions are: (a) The death receptor pathway is differently inactivated at multiple levels in lung cancer cell lines; and (b) MYC amplification in SCLC is associated with inactivation of most components of the DISC complex, with resistance to TRAIL and with expression of c-FLIP. These findings may have considerable clinical and therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2057020813,"Dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are critically involved in processing novel and rewarding information, and mediate the addictive properties of many drugs of abuse. Excitatory synapses on these neurons, like those in other brain regions, exhibit long-term depression (LTD). Amphetamine or dopamine block LTD at VTA synapses, indicating that both pathological and local physiological stimuli regulate LTD. Here we show that in common with other forms of LTD, VTA LTD results from a selective decrease in AMPA receptor function accompanied by a decrease in cell surface AMPA receptors. However, unlike the case for any previously described form of LTD, activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is necessary and sufficient to trigger LTD at synapses on VTA dopamine neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1990291644,"Here we show that the phosphorylation of histone acetyltransferase Tip60, a target of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1-encoded transactivator Tat, plays a crucial role in the control of its catalytic activity. Baculovirus-based expression and purification of Tip60 combined with mass spectrometry allowed the identification of serines 86 and 90 as two major sites of phosphorylation in vivo. The phosphorylation of Tip60 was found to modulate its histone acetyltransferase activity. One of the identified phosphorylated serines, Ser-90, was within a consensus cyclin B/Cdc2 site. Ser-90 was specifically phosphorylatedin vitro by the cyclin B/Cdc2 complex. Accordingly, the phosphorylation of Tip60 was enhanced after drug-induced arrest of cells in G2/M. This G2/M-dependent phosphorylation of Tip60 was abolished by treating cells with a specific inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinase, roscovitin. All together, these results strongly suggest a G2/M-dependent control of Tip60 activity.

Tip60 was first identified as a partner of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1-encoded transactivator protein Tat (1Kamine J. Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Later, investigations clearly showed it to be a specific member of the MYST family of nuclear histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; IL, interleukin; CIP, calf intestine phosphatase; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; HA, hemagglutinin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase (2Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30595-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Although the targeting of Tip60 by Tat was found to interfere with its HAT activity and to disturb the expression of at least one cellular gene (3Creaven M. Hans F. Mutskov V. Col E. Caron C. Dimitrov S. Khochbin S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8826-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the function of Tip60 remained elusive until recently. Indeed, the identification of proteins associated with ectopically expressed Tip60 showed the presence of associated ATPase and DNA helicase activities. Functional tests showed that Tip60 and associated proteins may play an essential role in DNA repair and apoptosis (4Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Moreover, considering other recent reports, it appears that Tip60 is involved in a wide variety of cellular functions. For instance, Tip60 was found to interact with the androgen receptor and to enhance its transactivation in a ligand-dependent manner (5Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17599-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Moreover, androgen receptor was found to be a substrate for Tip60 (6Gaughan L. Logan I.R. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25904-25913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Other steroid receptors such as estrogen and progesterone receptors have also shown an enhanced activity in the presence of Tip60 and their ligands (5Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17599-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Tip60 has also been involved in the NFκB response system, because it was found to interact directly with BCL-3, a member of IκB family. BCL-3 is thought to serve as an adaptor-bridging Tip60 to the NFκB p50/p52 and to participate in the gene activation function of this transcription factor (7Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has recently been shown that interleukin-1β induces the activation of a specific group of NFκB-responsive genes including KAl1 in relation to the selective recruitment of Tip60 to the promoter of this gene (8Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Other studies (9Sliva D. Zhu Y.X. Tsai S. Kamine J. Yang Y.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) showed that Tip60 can interact with interleukin-9 (IL-9) receptor, suggesting its possible role in IL-9 signaling. Tip60 was also found to interact directly with cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and interfere with its activity, implicating this HAT in the cAMP-dependent signaling process (10Gavaravarapu S. Kamine J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, Tip60 was also shown to interact with one of the endothelin receptors, ETA (11Lee H.J. Chun M. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16597-16600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All of these examples point to an important involvement of Tip60 in various receptor-mediated signaling processes. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has recently been shown that Tip60 is an essential component linking the proteolytic cleavage of Amyloid-β precursor protein to transcriptional activation (8Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 12Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The important function of Tip60 in cell signaling is probably the reason for its targeting by the HIV-1-encoded transactivator Tat. Indeed, it appears that Tat uses Tip60 to control cellular events for the benefit of the virus (13Caron C. Col E. Khochbin S. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here we evidenced a new property of Tip60. First, Tip60 has been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo, and second, two major sites of Tip60 phosphorylation have been discovered. The sequence of one of these sites encompassing serine 90 perfectly matches a Cdc2 phosphorylation site. We showed that cyclin B/Cdc2 complex can specifically phosphorylate Ser-90 in vitro and in vivo and that the phosphorylation of Tip60 was enhanced in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. This specific G2/M phosphorylation of Tip60 was inhibited when cells were treated with a specific inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, roscovitin. Our data clearly show that the phosphorylation of Tip60 controls its HAT activity and strongly suggest a role for Tip60 HAT activity in the control of G2/M-related events. Wild type or mutant Tip60 cDNA were cloned into pBacPAK9 transfer vector (Clontech) in-frame with a histidine tag at the C terminus or at the N terminus of the coding sequence. Viral particles were generated using the BacPAK baculovirus expression system (Clontech) and Sf21 insect cells. 2–3 days after infection, Tip60 proteins were purified from Sf21 cells by nickel affinity column (NiTA-agarose, Qiagen), eluted with 250 mm imidazole, and finally dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The purified proteins were kept at −20 °C and used in phosphatase treatment experiment, mass spectrometry analysis, and HAT assay (see below). The plasmid pcDNA-HA-Tip60 has been described previously (14Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The Tip60-(1–211) mutant was generated by PCR and cloned in-frame with the HA tag in the pcDNA-HA vector. The point mutations were generated by PCR, and the incorporation of all of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. In the Gly-380 mutant, glycine 380 was replaced by an alanine. In the Ser-86, Ser-90, and Ser-86/Ser-90 mutants, the serines were replaced by alanines. In the Leu-254/Leu-257 mutant, the two indicated leucines were replaced by alanines. Five hundred nanograms of His-Tip60 proteins produced in baculovirus were incubated with 10 units of calf intestine phosphatase (CIP) (New England BioLabs) in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitor (5 mm NaF) for 30 min at 37 °C (or 1 h on ice when the dephosphorylation was followed by a HAT assay). Tip60 was then removed by incubation of the reaction mixture with NiTA-agarose beads and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Phosphatase treatment of endogenous Tip60 was performed as follows. HeLa cell nuclei isolated from 107 cells were incubated with 50,000 units of CIP for 30 min at 37 °C. Nuclei were washed three times in the lysis buffer (15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 12% sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.65 mm spermidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100) and directly lysed in protein loading buffer. Tip60 was detected using an anti-Tip60 antibody described by Legube et. al. (14Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). HAT assays were performed using 4 μg of free core histones or 5 μg of oligonucleosomes, wild type, or mutant Tip60 proteins (100–200 ng) and 0.15 μCi of [14C]acetyl-CoA (65 mCi/mmol) (ICN) in HAT buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium butyrate) for 30 min at 30 °C. 50% of the reactions was loaded on a 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining to ensure equivalent loading of histones in each lane, and fluorography was performed after incubation of the gel in the Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences). In some assays, the HAT activity was analyzed with Tip60 immobilized on NiTA-agarose beads after alkaline phosphatase treatment. Mass spectra of the tryptic digests were acquired on a Biflex (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a gridless delayed extraction. The instrument was operated in linear mode. 0.5 μl of the digest solution (in 25 mm NH4HCO3) was deposited directly onto the sample probe on a dry thin layer of matrix made of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid mixed with nitrocellulose (mixture (4:3, v/v) of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid in acetone and a solution consisting of 10 mg of nitrocellulose dissolved in 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol/acetone (1:1, v/v)). The deposits were washed with 5 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid before the analysis. A mass list of peptides was obtained for each protein digest. Phosphorylated tryptic peptides were identified on the peptide mass fingerprint by a 80-Da (or multiples of 80 Da) mass shifts after the dephosphorylation step. The dephosphorylation reaction was done by treating the tryptic peptide mixture with bovine alkaline phosphatase in which the peptide digest (5 μl) was mixed with 5 μl of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase immobilized on agarose beads (P0762, Sigma) in 25 mmNH4HCO3 buffer. After 30 min (37 °C), the peptide digest was directly deposited on the MALDI sample probe for analysis. Phosphopeptides were purified from the crude tryptic digest using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography essentially as previously described (15Posewitz M.C. Tempst P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The tryptic digest (2 μl in 10 mmNH4HCO3, 5% acetic acid, 30% acetonitrile) was loaded on a ZipTipMC (ZT0MCS, Millipore,) that had been previously equilibrated following the recommendations of the manufacturer. The ZipTipMC column was then washed with 0.1% acetic acid followed by 0.1% acetic acid, 30% acetonitrile, and 0.1% acetic acid and finally eluted in 2% ammonium hydroxide (2 μl). Eluted peptides were then mixed with 50 mmNH4HCO3 (v/v) and analyzed by MALDI-MS. The digest solution was dried in a vacuum centrifuge and desalted with ZipTip C18 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) before the nanospray MS/MS analysis. A Q-TOF instrument (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) was used with a Z-spray ion-source working in the nanospray mode. Approximately 3–5 μl of the desalted sample was introduced into a needle (medium sample needle, PROTANA Inc. Odense, Denmark) to run MS and MS/MS experiments. The capillary voltage was set to an average voltage of 1000 V, and the sample cone was set to 50 V. Glufibrinopeptide was used to calibrate the instrument in the MS/MS mode. MS/MS spectra were transformed using MaxEnt3 (MassLynx), and amino acid sequences were analyzed using PepSeq (BioLynx). Wild type or mutant Tip60 peptides (mutant Ser-90 and mutant Ser-86/Ser-90) encompassing serines at positions 86 and 90 were synthesized, purified (Sigma), and reconstituted in distilled water at 5 mm. For the phosphorylation assays, 15 nmol of wild type or mutant peptides at a final concentration of 500 μm were incubated in Cdc2 kinase buffer supplemented with 100 μm cold ATP, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, ICN), and 5 units of Cdc2 kinase/cyclin B (New England BioLabs) for 30 min at 30 °C (final volume of 30 μl). In control reactions, the kinase or the peptide was omitted. Two volumes of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 20 μg of carrier bovine serum albumin were added at the end of the reaction, and the samples were spotted on P81 cellulose phosphate paper. Filters were then washed in 0.5% phosphoric acid (4 times, 10 min), rinsed in acetone, and finally used to measure 32P incorporation in a scintillation counter. HeLa cells were grown as described previously (14Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and transfected using Exgen (Euromedex) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as indicated by the suppliers. 24–48 h later, cells extracts were prepared by lysing cells directly in Laemmli sample buffer and sonicated. Stably Tip60 expressing HeLa cells (a gift of Dr. V. Ogrysko) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%) and antibiotics. To investigate the biochemical property of Tip60, we have expressed a histidine-tagged human Tip60 in insect cells using a baculovirus-based expression system. The recombinant protein was found to be an active HAT on purified histones as well as on nucleosomes (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, whereas Tip60 efficiently acetylated free histone H4 and H3, in nucleosomes, it essentially acetylated histone H4. However, the acetylation of nucleomosal H4 was much less efficient than that of free histones. Indeed, the gel containing nucleosomal histones had to be exposed for a longer period of time to obtain a comparable signal for the acetylation of free and nucleosomal H4. We have also noticed that the purified recombinant Tip60 migrated as a doublet on a 8% SDS-PAGE, and the treatment with the protein calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase prior to electrophoresis caused a shift of Tip60 to a faster migrating band (data not shown). This observation showed that protein phosphorylation was responsible for the observed shift in the electrophoretic mobility of Tip60. To determine the region of Tip60 concerned by phosphorylation, two fragments of Tip60 were expressed in insect cells, purified, and analyzed on a 15% SDS-PAGE, one containing the N-terminal chromodomain of Tip60 encompassing the first 211 amino acids and the other corresponding to the rest of the protein (Fig. 1 B, schemes). Fig. 1 B shows that the N-terminal fragment migrated as a doublet and that the CIP treatment caused a shift of the majority of the protein into a single fast migrating band (compare lane 1 with2). The 212–513 region of Tip60 migrated as a single band, and the CIP treatment did not affect its electrophoretic mobility (Fig1 B, lanes 3 and 4). Data presented above showed that the major sites of Tip60 phosphorylation are located in the first 211 amino acids of the protein. To determine precisely the sites of Tip60 phosphorylation, we chose a mass spectrometry-based approach. First, the mass spectra of the tryptic fragments of the 1–211 region of Tip60 were compared with that of the tryptic fragments of the CIP-treated protein. The MALDI-TOF analysis showed that peptide-(81–93) bears two phosphate groups. The Q-TOF sequencing of peptide-(81–93) from phosphorylated and CIP-treated proteins confirmed the above conclusion and showed that serines 86 and 90 are phosphorylated. Finally, tryptic fragments of Tip60-(1–211) were loaded on a ZipTip-MC column capable of retaining phospho-peptides, and the MALDI-TOF analysis of these peptides confirmed again the presence of two phosphate groups on peptide-(81–93). This analysis also showed the possible presence of phosphate groups on 190–211 and 204–211 tryptic fragments (data not shown). To evaluate the respective participation of serines 86 and 90 in Tip60 phosphorylation, we mutated either serine 86 or serine 90 or both to alanine and monitored their migration on 8% SDS-PAGE after an ectopic expression in HeLa cells. As controls, we also expressed either a Tip60 mutant in which glycine 380 was replaced by an alanine or Tip60 Leu-254/Leu-257 mutant in which the two indicated leucines potentially involved in a nuclear export signal were also changed to alanines. Fig. 2 B shows that only mutations affecting serines 86 and 90 affect the mobility of Tip60, which strongly suggests that these sites are majors sites of Tip60 phosphorylation in mammalian cells. This hypothesis was further confirmed by showing that CIP-treated Tip60-(1–211) fragment expressed in HeLa cells migrated at the same position as a Tip60-(1–211) fragment containing the Ser-86/Ser-90 mutation (Fig. 2 C). All of these results showed that Tip60 can be phosphorylated both in insect and mammalian cells, and serines 86 and 90 represent two major sites of phosphorylation in vivo. Finally, we showed that endogenous Tip60 detected in HeLa cell nuclear extracts migrated as a doublet and that the CIP treatment of the nuclei before the extract preparation led to the migration of Tip60 as a single band (Fig. 2 D). To evaluate the role of phosphorylation in the activity of Tip60, the HAT activity of purified phosphorylated Tip60 was compared with that of the CIP-treated protein. Fig. 3 Ashows that the pretreatment of Tip60 with increasing amounts of CIP considerably reduced the HAT activity of the protein (comparelanes 2 and 3 with 1). In the same experiment when CIP was added in the presence of its inhibitor NaF (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–6) or heat-inactivated prior to its addition (Fig. 3 B, lane 9), no detectable modification of Tip60 HAT activity was observed compared with the control. These experiments show that the inhibition of Tip60 HAT activity is not because of the presence of CIP itself in the reaction medium but because of its ability to dephosphorylate Tip60. Moreover, the activity of the CIP-treated Tip60 was comparable with that of a mutated Tip60, Tip60Gly-380, containing a mutation severely affecting its HAT activity (Fig. 3 B, lane 11). In this mutant, a glycine critical for acetyl-CoA binding in all MYST members of HATs was replaced by an alanine. This mutation had been previously shown to inactivate the Drosophila Tip60 homologue MOF (16Akhtar A. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 367-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and was also one of the two mutations introduced by Ikura et al. (4Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) to inactivate Tip60. The above experiment clearly showed that dephosphorylated Tip60 has a poor catalytic activity. To show the specific involvement of the serines 86 and 90 in the control of the HAT activity of Tip60, baculovirus-based expression was used to express and purify a mutated form of Tip60 (Tip60Ser-86/Ser-90) in which these two serines were replaced by alanines. A HAT assay was set up to compare the HAT activity of the wild type, phosphorylated Tip60 with that of Tip60Ser-86/Ser-90. Fig. 3 C shows that, as in mammalian cells, the double mutant Tip60 migrated faster than the wild type protein (upper panel). Moreover, this experiment also showed that Tip60Ser-86/Ser-90 was not as efficient as wild-type Tip60 at acetylating histones. The data presented thus far showed the critical role of Tip60 phosphorylation in the control of its catalytic activity. Therefore, it appeared very important to identify the kinases involved to better understand the functional significance of this regulation of Tip60 activity by its phosphorylation. The analysis of the sequence encompassing Ser-86 and Ser-90 showed that Ser-90 corresponded to a potential p34 Cdc2 phosphorylation site XSPX(R/K) (17Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the ability of cyclin B/Cdc2 to phosphorylate Ser-90, we have synthesized three peptides encompassing the amino acid 82–96 region of Tip60. One peptide corresponded to the wild type sequence, and the two others contained serine replacement (Ser to Ala) of either Ser-90 or both Ser-86 and Ser-90 (Fig. 4 A). The peptides were incubated with purified cyclin B/Cdc2 complex in the presence of32P-labeled ATP, and peptide phosphorylation was monitored. Fig. 4 B shows that only the wild type peptide was phosphorylated by the purified cyclin B/Cdc2 complex. The phosphorylation of a peptide containing the “Ser-90 to Ala” mutation was comparable with that of a peptide containing replacements of both serines, Ser-86 and Ser-90, to alanines or that of the wild type peptide incubated with [32P]ATP in the absence of the enzyme. This experiment shows that cyclin B/Cdc2 specifically phosphorylates Ser-90 of Tip60. To show the participation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in the phosphorylation of Tip60, HeLa cells were treated with nocodazole, inducing an arrest at G2/M phase of the cell cycle because of its ability to depolymerize microtubules. Nocodazole-treated cells were lysed, and Tip60 was detected using an anti-Tip60 antibody (14Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) when ∼90% of cells were in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (data not shown). Fig. 5 A shows that, as expected, in cycling cells, Tip60 appeared as a doublet. Interestingly, after the treatment of cells with nocodazole, almost only the phosphorylated form of Tip60 was visible. However, in our hands for unknown reasons, the endogenous Tip60 could not be detected with a reasonable sensitivity in a reproducible manner. Therefore, to better investigate the involvement of the CDKs in the phosphorylation of Tip60, we used a characterized HeLa cell line stably expressing HA-tagged Tip60 (4Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) to evaluate Tip60 phosphorylation in response to specific drugs. In cycling HeLa cells, the HA-Tip60 appeared also as a doublet. After the treatment of cells with nocodazole, the HA-Tip60 behaved like the endogenous protein because the amount of the phosphorylated form of the protein increased (Fig. 5 B,lane 3). This nocodazole-induced accumulation of phosphorylated HA-Tip60 was severely reduced when the nocodazole-treated cells were treated with roscovitin, a specific inhibitor of CDKs (18Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J. Blow J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J. Moulinoux J. Eur. J.

All together, these data show the participation of CDKs in the phosphorylation of Tip60 and strongly suggest a role for Tip60 in the control of cell cycle-related events.Figure 5The arrest of cells at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle is associated with an enhancement of Tip60 phosphorylation. A, HeLa cells were treated with nocodazole (100 ng/ml) for 16 h and lysed, and the migration of the endogenous Tip60 was monitored by Western blotting using an anti-Tip60 antibody.

The specific function of several members of this family is now emerging in different species (19Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). For instance, in yeast, two HATs of the MYST family, SAS2 and SAS3, play a role in silencing. The HAT activity of SAS3 has been shownin vitro (20Takechi S. Nakayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and moreover, it has been found within the NuA3 complex, which specifically acetylates histone H3 in nucleosomes (21John S. Howe L. Tafrov S.T. Grant P.A. Sternglanz R. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1196-1208PubMed Google Scholar). The third member of MYST HATs in yeast, Esa1, appears to be responsible for cell cycle progression (22Clarke A.S. Lowell J.E. Jacobson S.J. Pillus L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2515-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This HAT is also present in a complex known as NuA4 (23Allard S. Utley R.T. Savard J. Clarke A. Grant P. Brandl C.J. Pillus L. Workman J.L. Cote J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5108-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and is required for DNA double-stranded break repair (24Bird A.W. Yu D.Y. Pray-Grant M.G. Qiu Q. Harmon K.E. Megee P.C. Grant P.A. Smith M.M. Christman M.F. Nature. 2002; 419: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, MOF, a MYST HAT, has been clearly shown to be involved in the male X chromosome hyperactivation by specifically acetylating histone H4 lysine 16 (16). Interestingly, as Tip60, MOF has a canonic chromodomain, which possesses the ability to bind to RNA in vitro and to the X chromosome-associated RNA in vivo (25Akhtar A. Zink D. Becker P.B. Nature. 2000; 407: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The role of other vertebrate MYST members, HBO1, MORF, and MOZ, has not yet been defined (19Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that the HATs of the MYST family are involved in the control of a variety of critical cellular events. This conclusion implies that the activity and the expression of these enzymes should be tightly regulated. In the literature, there is almost no hint regarding this issue. Our data provide the first indication of the regulated expression and activity of a member of the MYST acetyltransferases, Tip60. Indeed, we have previously shown that the cellular concentration of Tip60 is controlled by Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of the protein (14Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here we show that the phosphorylation of Tip60 is a controlled phenomenon and modulates the activity of the protein. Tip60 is not the only HAT whose activity is controlled by phosphorylation. Indeed, it has been shown that the transcription factor ATF-2 possesses an intrinsic HAT activity and that its phosphorylation considerably stimulates its HAT activity (26Kawasaki H. Schiltz L. Chiu R. Itakura K. Taira K. Nakatani Y. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 2000; 405: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Another example is CREB-binding protein, which is phosphorylated at the G1/S boundary, and this phosphorylation was also shown to stimulate its HAT activity (27Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Barre F.X. Dkhissi F. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Girault J.A. Robin P. Knibiehler M. Pritchard L.L. Ducommun B. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 396: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation-dependent control of CREB-binding protein activity allows this HAT to be responsive to distinct signaling pathways. Indeed, kinases as different as p44 MAPK/ERK1 (28Ait-Si-Ali S. Carlisi D. Ramirez S. Upegui-Gonzalez L.C. Duquet A. Robin P. Rudkin B. Harel-Bellan A. Trouche D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), cell cycle-dependent kinases such as cyclin E/Cdk2 (27Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Barre F.X. Dkhissi F. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Girault J.A. Robin P. Knibiehler M. Pritchard L.L. Ducommun B. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 396: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), as well as MEKK1 (29See R.H. Calvo D. Shi Y. Kawa H. Luke M.P. Yuan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16310-16317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) are capable of phosphorylating and, hence, activating the CREB-binding protein catalytic activity. In the case of Tip60, Ser-90 is located within a canonic cyclin B/Cdc2 site and the enzyme was found here to specifically phosphorylate this specific serine. Interestingly, Ser-90 is highly conserved among Tip60 homologues in different species (data not shown), suggesting that this mode of regulation is also conserved during evolution. Furthermore, our data provide a new basis to reconsider the many functions of Tip60. Indeed, Tip60 appears as an important intermediate in several unrelated receptor-mediated signaling processes (5Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol.

Therefore, our data suggest that an additional control level, that of Tip60 phosphorylation, needs to be coordinated with signals induced by steroids (5Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16597-16600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Besides, the HAT activity of Tip60 has been shown to be essential in the cellular response to DNA damage (4Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Therefore, the phosphorylation of Tip60 regulating its HAT activity could well play an important role in this process and somehow link Tip60 function to the replication checkpoint. Finally, the HAT activity of Tip60 was found to mediate gene activation following the cleavage of amyloid-β precursor (12Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). These data should also be reconsidered in the light of a linkage between Tip60 catalytic activity and its phosphorylation. In summary, this work has allowed to establish a link between CDKs and the activity of Tip60. However, other kinases may also phosphorylate Tip60, establishing a specific linkage between Tip60 activity and one or several of the signaling pathways discussed above. We thank Dr. Vasily Ogrysko for the generous gift of the stable Tip60-expressing HeLa cell line, Sandrine Curtet and Marie-Paule Brocard for technical assistance, and Dr. Sophie Rousseaux for the critical reading of the paper."

https://openalex.org/W2330103665,"The vaccinia virus (VV) E3L gene encodes a dsRNA binding protein that inhibits activation of the IFN-induced, dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, (PKR), the 2–5A synthetases/RNase L system and other dsRNA dependent pathways, thus leading to efficient VV replication. To analyse E3L effects over cellular metabolism in a virus-free system, we have generated stable mouse 3T3 cell lines expressing E3L. Expression of E3L in NIH3T3 cells results in inhibition of eIF-2α phosphorylation and IκBα degradation in response to dsRNA. Antiviral responses induced by IFN-α/β were partially impaired in 3T3-E3L cells, as determined by a viability assay upon VSV infection. E3L expression also confers resistance to dsRNA-triggered apoptosis. Interestingly, cells expressing E3L grew faster than control cells, and showed increased expression of cyclin A and decreased levels of p27Kip1. E3L cooperated with H-ras in a focus formation assay, and NIH3T3 E3L cells formed solid tumors when injected in nude mice. Overall, our findings reveal that interference of E3L protein with several cellular pathways, results in promotion of cellular growth, impairment of antiviral activity and resistance to apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2079174786,"The oncoprotein transcription factor Myc plays a crucial role in the control of cell growth and proliferation. Consistent with its potent growth-promoting properties, cells have evolved a number of mechanisms to limit the activity and accumulation of the Myc protein. One of the most striking of these mechanisms is ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated proteolysis, which typically destroys Myc within minutes of its synthesis. Here we show that, despite the extreme instability of the Myc protein, cells contain a pool of Myc that is metabolically stable. Entry of Myc into the stable pool is signaled by an element within the carboxy-terminus of the protein, and is a cell-specific process that is regulated during mitosis and by interaction with Max. These data demonstrate that - even for a rapidly turned-over protein such as Myc - metabolically stable and unstable forms of a protein can co-exist in cells, and suggest that the rate of destruction of Myc molecules is linked to their specific functions."
https://openalex.org/W2036898191,"3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) is a popular drug of abuse. MDMA is pharmacologically classified as an entactogen because of its affinities to classical hallucinogens and stimulants. Oral ingestion of a single dose of the drug is associated with euphoria, elevated self-confidence, and heightened sensory awareness in humans. Evidence for neurotoxicity in the human serotonin (5-HT) system has been provided. In rats, a single injection of MDMA induces hyperthermia and formation of reactive oxygen species. These effects may cause MDMA-associated, long-term 5-HT depletion, with the cortex being quite sensitive to the biochemical effects of MDMA. It has been suggested that these MDMA effects may be associated with molecular changes in this brain region. To test these ideas, we have made use of the cDNA array analysis, which can provide a more global view of the molecular changes secondary to MDMA injections. Our results show that the genes regulated by MDMA encode proteins that belong to signaling pathways, transcription regulators, or xenobiotic metabolism. Our observations indicate that cortical cells respond to the acute administration of MDMA by modulating transcription of several genes that might lead to long-term changes in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2327380897,"Phosphorylation of linker histone H1(S)-3 (previously named H1b) and core histone H3 is elevated in mouse fibroblasts transformed with oncogenes or constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK). H1(S)-3 phosphorylation is the only histone modification known to be dependent upon transcription and replication. Our results show that the increased amounts of phosphorylated H1(S)-3 in the oncogene Ha-ras-transformed mouse fibroblasts was a consequence of an elevated Cdk2 activity rather than the reduced activity of a H1 phosphatase, which our studies suggest is PP1. Induction of oncogenic ras expression results in an increase in H1(S)-3 and H3 phosphorylation. However, in contrast to the phosphorylation of H3, which occurred immediately following the onset of Ras expression, there was a lag of several hours before H1(S)-3 phosphorylation levels increased. We found that there was a transient increase in the levels of p21(cip1), which inhibited the H1 kinase activity of Cdk2. Cdk2 activity and H1(S)-3 phosphorylated levels increased after p21(cip1) levels declined. Our studies suggest that persistent activation of the Ras-MAPK signal transduction pathway in oncogene-transformed cells results in deregulated activity of kinases phosphorylating H3 and H1(S)-3 associated with transcribed genes. The chromatin remodelling actions of these modified histones may result in aberrant gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2137164511,"The feasibility of using antibody expressing transgenic plants either to neutralize bioactive molecules in the rhizosphere, or to accumulate and concentrate the molecules in leaves has been demonstrated in a model system consisting of hydroponic Nicotiana plant cultures expressing a murine monoclonal IgG1. Two transgenic plant types were used; in the first, functional antibody was rhizosecreted and shown to bind with antigen in the surrounding medium to form an immune complex. In the second, a transmembrane sequence retained monoclonal antibody in the plants, on the plasma membrane. Antigen added to the nutrient medium around the roots of mIgG plants was transported within 24 h to the topmost leaves of the plant where it was sequestered as an immune complex by binding to antibody on the cell membrane. Concentration of immune complex in the leaf tissue remained constant over a 72 h period after removal of antigen from nutrient medium. Free antigen was not detected in the leaves of wild-type plants. The two strategies of rhizosecretion-mediated binding and sequestration in leaf tissue could potentially be used in the phytoremediation of any pollutant for which it is possible to generate a monoclonal antibody."

Here, we show that Bifocal (Bif), a putative cytoskeletal regulator, is a component of the Msn pathway for regulating R cell growth cone targeting. bif displays strong genetic interaction with msn. Phenotypic analysis indicates a specific role for Bif to terminate R1-R6 growth cones. Biochemical studies show that Msn associates directly with Bif and phosphorylates Bif in vitro. Cell culture studies demonstrate that Msn interacts with Bif to regulate F-actin structure and filopodium formation. We propose that Bif functions downstream of Msn to reorganize actin cytoskeleton in decelerating R cell growth cone motility at the target region."
https://openalex.org/W2026475481,"We have identified a novel von Willebrand factor/fibrinogen/selectin-independent, platelet adhesion-promoting function of vascular PG-M/versicans that may be relevant in normal venous thrombosis and critical in atherosclerotic conditions. A purification scheme was devised to obtain vascular versicans, which by biochemical, immunochemical, and ultrastructural means were asserted to be 1) composed primarily of isoforms V1 and V2; 2) free of contaminants; 3) prevalently substituted with chondroitin-4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate (DS) chains; and 4) capable of binding hyaluronan to form link protein-stabilized ternary complexes. Real-time analysis of human platelet perfused under diverse shear forces showed that they largely failed to bind to several vascular and nonvascular proteoglycans (PGs). In contrast, they bound in a dose- and shear rate-dependent manner to vascular versicans, exhibiting a unique attachment-detachment kinetics and establishing a firm substrate tethering characterized with no significant aggregation. Digestion of these PGs with lyases and competition experiments with purified glycosaminoglycans revealed that platelet adhesion to vascular versicans was primarily mediated by their DS chains. Incorporation of the versicans into fibrillar collagen substrates augmented their adhesive activity and strongly promoted platelet aggregation at low and high shear rates. Affinity chromatography of platelet surfaces on DS columns identified a 120-140 kDa polypeptide complex that behaved as a specific vascular versican binding membrane ligand in solid-phase binding assays. These findings indicate that selective versican variants of the subendothelium may serve as ancillary GPIbalpha/integrin/selectin-independent platelet ligands in healthy and diseased vascular beds and may be directly responsible for the platelet accruing after rupture of atherosclerotic plaques."
