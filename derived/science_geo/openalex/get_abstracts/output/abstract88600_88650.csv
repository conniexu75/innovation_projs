https://openalex.org/W2126974689,"Examination of temporal lobe structures from Alzheimer patients reveals a specific cellular pattern of pathology of the subiculum of the hippocampal formation and layers II and IV of the entorhinal cortex. The affected cells are precisely those that interconnect the hippocampal formation with the association cortices, basal forebrain, thalamus, and hypothalamus, structures crucial to memory. This focal pattern of pathology isolates the hippocampal formation from much of its input and output and probably contributes to the memory disorder in Alzheimer patients."
https://openalex.org/W1993902481,"The development of most regions of the vertebrate nervous system includes a distinct phase of neuronal degeneration during which a substantial proportion of the neurons initially generated die. This degeneration primarily adjusts the magnitude of each neuronal population to the size or functional needs of its projection field, but in the process it seems also to eliminate many neurons whose axons have grown to either the wrong target or an inappropriate region within the target area. In addition, many connections that are initially formed are later eliminated without the death of the parent cell. In most cases such process elimination results in the removal of terminal axonal branches and hence serves as a mechanism to ""fine-tune"" neuronal wiring. However, there are now also several examples of the large-scale elimination of early-formed pathways as a result of the selective degeneration of long axon collaterals. Thus, far from being relatively minor aspects of neural development, these regressive phenomena are now recognized as playing a major role in determining the form of the mature nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1975891687,Recent neurophysiological findings have demonstrated that abstinent chronic alcoholics manifest deficits in event-related brain potentials. To explore possible biological antecedents of alcoholism the present study examined boys at high risk for alcoholism. Event-related brain potentials were recorded from biological sons of alcoholic fathers and matched control boys. Differences in the P3 component of the potentials were obtained between the high-risk and control subjects.
https://openalex.org/W2024400996,"Efflux of K+ from dissociated salamander Müller cells was measured with ion-selective microelectrodes. When the distal end of an isolated cell was exposed to high concentrations of extracellular K+, efflux occurred primarily from the endfoot, a cell process previously shown to contain most of the K+ conductance of the cell membrane. Computer simulations of K+ dynamics in the retina indicate that shunting ions through the Müller cell endfoot process is more effective in clearing local increases in extracellular K+ from the retina than is diffusion through extracellular space."
https://openalex.org/W2044344777,"Insect embryos, with their relatively simple nervous systems, provide a model system with which to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cell recognition during neuronal development. Such an approach can take advantage of the accessible cells of the grasshopper embryo and the accessible genes of Drosophila. The growth cones of identified neurons express selective affinities for specific axonal surfaces; such specificities give rise to the stereotyped patterns of selective fasciculation common to both species. These and other results suggest that early in development cell lineage and cell interactions lead to the differential expression of cell recognition molecules on the surfaces of small subsets of embryonic neurons whose axons selectively fasciculate with one another. Monoclonal antibodies reveal surface molecules in the Drosophila embryo whose expression correlates with this prediction. It should now be possible to isolate the genes encoding these potential cell recognition molecules and to test their function through the use of molecular genetic approaches in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1522291368,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors contain a readily reducible disulfide bond at the periphery of the acetylcholine binding site. Following reduction of this disulfide, the binding site is susceptible to affinity labeling by electrophilic reagents with quaternary ammonium moieties. We reduced purified receptor from Torpedo californica electric tissue and affinity alkylated it with 4-(N-maleimido)benzyltri[3H]methylammonium iodide. The label was incorporated solely into the alpha subunit of the receptor. Isolated, labeled alpha subunit was cleaved with CNBr, and the fragments were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. A uniquely labeled CNBr fragment was isolated, and its partial sequence was determined by automated Edman degradation. This CNBr fragment was cleaved at tryptophan residues, the subfragments were separated, and the labeled subfragments were partially sequenced. From our protein sequence information, we identify the labeled CNBr fragment as residues 179 to 207 of the sequence of alpha predicted from the cDNA sequence (Noda, M., Takahashi, H., Tanabe, T., Toyosato, M., Furutani, Y., Hirose, T., Asai, M., Inayama, S., Miyata, T., and Numa, S. (1982) Nature (Lond.) 299, 793-797). From the cycle of the Edman degradation in which radioactive residues are released, we conclude that Cys 192 and, possibly in addition, Cys 193 are the residues specifically labeled by 4-(N-maleimido)benzyltri[3H]methylammonium iodide. They are, therefore, close to the acetylcholine binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2033483776,"Japanese macaques were trained to discriminate two forms of their coo vocalization before and after unilateral and bilateral ablation of the temporal cortex. Unilateral ablation of the left superior temporal gyrus, including auditory cortex, resulted in an initial impairment in the discrimination, but similar unilateral ablation of the right superior temporal gyrus had no effect. Bilateral temporal lesions including auditory cortex completely abolished the ability of the animals to discriminate their coos. Neither unilateral nor bilateral ablation of cortex dorsal to and sparing the auditory cortex had any effect on the discrimination. The perception of species-specific vocalizations by Japanese macaques seems to be mediated by the temporal cortex, with the left hemisphere playing a predominant role."

The two planar quinoxaline rings of triostin A bis intercalate on the minor groove of the DNA double helix surrounding the CG base pairs at either end. The alanine residues form hydrogen bonds to the guanines. Base stacking in the DNA is perturbed, and the major binding interaction involves a large number of van der Waals contacts between the peptides and the nucleic acid. The adenine residues in the center are in the syn conformation and are paired to thymine through Hoogsteen base pairing."
https://openalex.org/W2051226924,"The presence of a great variety of neuron-specific phosphoproteins in nervous tissue supports the view that protein phosphorylation plays many roles in neuronal function. The physiological significance of several of these phosphoproteins has already been established. Some neuronal phosphoproteins have been detected throughout the entire nervous system, whereas the distribution of others is limited to one or a few neuronal cell types. These various neuron-specific phosphoproteins are proving of value in the study of the physiology, anatomy, developmental biology, and pathophysiology of the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2080484121,"Mouse tumors induced by gamma radiation are a useful model system for oncogenesis. DNA from such tumors contains an activated K-ras oncogene that can transform NIH 3T3 cells. This report describes the cloning of a fragment of the mouse K-ras oncogene containing the first exon from both a transformant in rat-2 cells and the brain of the same mouse that developed the tumor. Hybrid constructs containing one of the two pieces were made and only the plasmid including the first exon from the transformant gave rise to foci in NIH 3T3 cells. There was only a single base difference (G----A) in the exonic sequence, which changed glycine to aspartic acid in the transformant. By use of a synthetic oligonucleotide the presence of the mutation was demonstrated in the original tumor, ruling out modifications during DNA-mediated gene transfer and indicating that the alteration was present in the thymic lymphoma but absent from other nonmalignant tissue. The results are compatible with gamma radiation being a source of point mutations."

This division is controlled, at least in the early stages of regeneration, by the nerve supply to the blastema. A monoclonal antibody to newt blastema cells has provided evidence that Schwann cells and muscle fibers contribute to the blastema, and identifies blastemal cells whose division is persistently dependent on the nerve. Glial growth factor, a molecule identified by its action on rat Schwann cells, is present in the newt blastema and is lost on denervation."
https://openalex.org/W1977707358,"Deaths associated with injected street preparations of heroin increased substantially in the District of Columbia between April 1979 and December 1982. The 1981 population-based mortality rate (17.4 per 100,000) is possibly the highest ever reported. A case-control study based on toxicologic analyses of postmortem blood samples indicates that concentrations of both heroin and ethanol are substantial risk factors for heroin-related deaths. Analyses of the composition of street-level preparations of heroin and quarterly mortality indicate that the quantity of heroin in packages sold on the street, the price of heroin in these packages, and the quinine weight per package each predict deaths equally as well. An increase in the causal use of heroin in combination with ethanol and quinine is the probable cause of this epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2059335595,"Some 30,000 genes are expressed exclusively in the rat brain, many of which contain a genetic element called an identifier sequence located in at least one of their introns. The identifier sequences are transcribed by RNA polymerase III exclusively in neurons to produce two RNA species, BC1 and BC2, of 160 and 100 to 110 nucleotides. This transcriptional event may define regions of chromatin that contain neuronal-specific genes and may poise these genes for transcription by polymerase II by rendering the gene promoters accessible to soluble trans-acting molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1522205670,"The hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase that is present on the outer surface of the mitochondrial inner membrane demonstrates hyperbolic substrate saturation curves with oleoyl-CoA in both fasted and fed rats. However, the addition of malonyl-CoA resulted in sigmoid substrate saturation curves, suggesting that malonyl-CoA induced the cooperative behavior. There was more of the outer carnitine palmitoyltransferase in liver mitochondria derived from fasted rats and that enzyme had a much greater Ki for malonyl-CoA than the enzyme from fed rats, but the Km values were apparently not different. The Dixon plot with mitochondria from fed rats, but not fasted rats, was curved upward, indicating cooperative inhibition by malonyl-CoA. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase of heart mitochondria had a Ki for malonyl-CoA that was much less than that of the liver enzyme and it did not change on fasting. Furthermore, no evidence for cooperative inhibition was found in the heart. The results of these studies indicate that carnitine palmitoyltransferase is not subject to substrate cooperativity and that malonyl-CoA is not a simple competitive inhibitor of this enzyme but inhibits by a mechanism involving cooperative inhibition. The fasting-feeding cycle induces changes in the liver enzyme that alter its affinity for malonyl-CoA without changing its affinity for its acyl-CoA substrate. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase from heart appears to be different from that of liver and is apparently not subject to the same control mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1549989653,"Rapid reaction studies presented herein show that ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR, EC 1.18.1.2) catalyzes electron transfer from spinach ferredoxin (Fd) to NADP+ via a ternary complex, Fd X FNR X NADP+. In the absence of NADP+, reduction of ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase by Fd was much slower than the catalytic rate: 37-80 s-1 versus at least 445 e-s-1; dissociation of oxidized spinach ferredoxin (Fdox) from one-electron reduced ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase (FNRsq) limited the reduction of FNR. This confirms the steady-state kinetic analysis of Masaki et al. (Masaki, R., Yoshikaya, S., and Matsubara, H. (1982) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 700, 101-109). Occupation of the NADP+ binding site of FNR by NADP+ or by 2',5'-ADP (a nonreducible NADP+ analogue) greatly increased the rate of electron transfer from Fd to FNR, releiving inhibition by Fdox. NADP+ (and 2',5'-ADP) probably facilitate the dissociation of Fdox; equilibrium studies have shown that nucleotide binding decreases the association of Fd with FNR (Batie, C. J. (1983) Ph.D. dissertation, Duke University; Batie, C. J., and Kamin, H. (1982) in Flavins and Flavoproteins VII (Massey, V., and Williams, C. H., Jr., eds) pp. 679-683, Elsevier, New York; Batie, C.J., and Kamin, H. (1982) Fed. Proc. 41, 888; and Batie, C.J., and Kamin, H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8832-8839). Premixing Fd with FNR was found to inhibit the reaction of the flavoprotein with NADP+ and with NADPH; thus, substrate binding may be ordered, NADP+ first, then Fd. FNRred and NADP+ very rapidly formed an FNRred X NADP+ complex with flavin to nicotinamide charge transfer bands. The Fdred X NADP+ complex then relaxed to an equilibrium species; the spectrum indicated a predominance of FNRox X NADPH charge-transfer complex. However, charge-transfer species were not observed during turnover; thus, their participation in catalysis of electron transfer from Fd to NADP+ remains uncertain. The catalytic rate of Fd to NADP+ electron transfer, as well as the rates of electron transfer from Fd to FNR, and from FNR to NADP+ were decreased when the reactants were in D2O; diaphorase activity was unaffected by solvent. On the basis of the data presented, a scheme for the catalytic mechanism of catalysis by FNR is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1997029893,"Embryonic chicken brain tissue cultured in media containing 35S-labeled sulfate or 32P-labeled phosphate incorporated 35S or 32P into the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM). The 35S label was located in asparagine-linked carbohydrates on both glycopeptides (molecular weights, 170,000 and 140,000) but not in the sialic acid. The 32P label was detected in phosphoamino acids in the carboxyl-terminal third of both polypeptides, but the ratio of phosphoserine to phosphothreonine differed in the two species. The sulfated saccharides and phosphoamino acids may provide additional sites for functional control of N-CAM."
https://openalex.org/W1569084270,"Hydrophobic binding properties of purified bovine gallbladder mucin were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy using 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) and N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine. The purified glycoprotein contained 75.5%, dry weight, as carbohydrate, 16.3% as protein, and 3.7% as sulfate; Mr = 2.2 X 10(6) was estimated by chromatography on Sephacryl S-500. Mucin contained a large number of low-affinity binding sites for these hydrophobic ligands. The dissociation constant, KD of mucin-ANS binding was 2.7 X 10(-5); each mucin molecule had approximately 42 binding sites for ANS. These binding sites were deduced to be on the unglycosylated portion of the protein core, as Pronase digestion completely eliminated binding. Reduction of mucin with 2-mercaptoethanol increased the fluorescence yield by formation of subunits with increased binding sites for the ligand. Increasing NaCl concentration (0.125 to 2.0 M) and decreasing pH (9 to 3) progressively increased fluorescence with the charged ligand ANS, suggesting that the binding site may have acidic groups which are shielded at high ionic strength or low pH. The fluorescent yield with N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine, an uncharged ligand, was an order of magnitude higher than with ANS. Bilirubin and bromosulfophthalein inhibited mucin-induced ANS fluorescence, but bile acids did not. Gallbladder mucin contains hydrophobic binding domains in the nonglycosylated peptide core that are involved in polymer formation and binding of biliary lipids and pigment."
https://openalex.org/W80648895,"The adenovirus E1b region (mp 4.5-11.2) codes for two major tumor antigens of 53 and 19 kDa. The lp+ locus maps within the 19-kDa tumor antigen-coding region and has been shown to play an essential role in cell transformation. We have investigated the role of the 19-kDa tumor antigen during productive virus growth using a specific Ad2 mutant (dl250) lacking most of the 19-kDa tumor antigen-coding region. Mutant dl250 grows more slowly and yields about 100-fold less progeny virus than Ad2 wt in human KB cells. In cells infected with mutant dl250, viral DNA is present at only about one-half the level of that of Ad2 wt. The defect in DNA accumulation appears to be both at the level of DNA synthesis and stability of newly synthesized DNA. In mutant-infected cells, newly replicated viral as well as cellular DNA are extensively degraded during late stages of viral infection. We have mapped a class of Ad12 (highly oncogenic group A) mutants (cyt) that are nononcogenic in newborn hamsters and induce DNA degradation to the 19-kDa tumor antigen-coding region by intertypic complementation analysis. These results strongly suggest that the 19-kDa tumor antigen plays an essential role in efficient viral DNA synthesis and protection of newly replicated viral DNA against cellular nucleases in addition to its role in cell transformation and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1529795395,"The molecular masses of the UDP-glucuronyltransferases were determined by means of radiation-inactivation analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated lyophilized rat liver microsomal preparations using a calibrated 60Co source. Bilirubin glucuronidation with formation of bilirubin monoglucuronide is catalyzed by a 41,500-Da enzyme; conversion of bilirubin mono- to diglucuronide is catalyzed by a 175,000-Da enzyme. The glucuronidation of estrone and testosterone is mediated by enzymes with molecular masses of 73,500 and 142,000 Da, respectively, and the glucuronidation of p-nitrophenol and phenolphthalein is mediated by enzymes with molecular masses of 109,000 and 159,000 Da, respectively. Our results show that UDP-glucuronyltransferase consists of a heterogenous group of enzymes with strikingly different molecular masses. Our data furthermore suggest that these enzymes may be oligomers composed of one to four subunits with similar molecular masses. Based on these findings, a molecular model of bilirubin UDP-glucuronyltransferase is proposed, consisting of four subunits. For bilirubin diglucuronide formation, the complete tetrameric enzyme is required, whereas formation of monoglucuronide can be mediated by a single subunit. The monomeric monoglucuronide-forming enzyme is resistant to sodium dodecyl sulfate, treatment whereas the tetrameric diglucuronide-forming enzyme is labile, but once inactivated, the diglucuronide-forming enzyme can be reconstituted by decreasing the sodium dodecyl sulfate concentration by means of dialysis."
https://openalex.org/W2069536749,"The Aplysia neuroendocrine system is a particularly advantageous model for cellular and molecular studies because of the relatively small number and large size of its component neurons. Recombinant DNA techniques have been used to isolate the genes that encode the precursors of peptides expressed in identified neurons of known function. The organization and developmental expression of these genes have been examined in detail. Several of the genes encode precursors of multiple biologically active peptides that are expressed in cells which also contain classical transmitters. These studies, as well as immunohistochemical studies and the use of intracellular recording and voltage clamp techniques are the first steps toward revealing the mechanisms by which neuropeptides govern simple behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1485053837,"The purification and properties of 4 inducible cytosolic rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes are described. Based on their behavior during purification and their properties, the activities can be grouped into 2 classes. The isozyme inducible in normal liver by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and the tumor-specific isozyme found in hepatocellular carcinomas have apparent molecular weights of 110,000, prefer NADP+ as coenzyme, and preferentially oxidize benzaldehyde-like aromatic aldehydes, but not phenylacetaldehyde. They also have identical pH profiles and responses to effectors. These isozymes differ slightly in isoelectric point and thermal stability. The normal liver phenobarbital-inducible isozyme and the isozyme appearing during the promotion phase of hepatocarcinogenesis appear to be identical. Both have apparent molecular weights of 165,000, are NAD-specific and prefer aliphatic aldehydes. They can oxidize phenylacetaldehyde, but not benzaldehyde-like aromatic aldehydes. They also have identical pH and thermal stability profiles and responses to effectors. While the 4 inducible isozymes share identical subunit molecular weights (54,000) with the normal liver millimolar Km aldehyde dehydrogenases, they are distinctly different enzymatic species. The interrelationships of the various normal liver and inducible rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenases are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1604995875,"From normal rat liver mitochondrial and microsomal fractions, 4 distinct aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes with millimolar substrate Km values have been purified and characterized. Two isozymes were isolated from mitochondria and 2 from microsomes. A mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase with a substrate Km in the micromolar range was also identified. Subunit molecular weights for all millimolar Km isozymes is 54,000. The mitochondrial and microsomal millimolar Km isozymes are clearly distinguishable from each other by substrate and coenzyme specificity, pH velocity profiles, and thermal stability. By these same properties, the 2 isozymes from each organelle are virtually identical. The 2 mitochondrial isozymes can be distinguished by apparent molecular weight (I, 170,000; II, approximately 250,000), Km for NADP+, effect of inhibitors, and pI. The 2 microsomal isozymes are of the same apparent molecular weight (approximately 250,000), but are distinguishable by their Km values for benzaldehyde and NADP+, response to inhibitors, and pI."
https://openalex.org/W1520993960,"Plasma membranes isolated from rabbit liver retain the ability to interact specifically with heme-hemopexin. In this system, apohemopexin does not compete effectively with heme-hemopexin for binding. The membranes bind heme-hemopexin complexes with high affinity (KD = 6.8 X 10(-7) M) and with an apparent capacity of 2.3 pmol/mg of membrane protein. These membranes also retain the ability to remove heme from heme-hemopexin. The release of heme reaches a plateau after 15-30 min at 30 degrees C and does not involve metabolic energy, proteolysis of hemopexin or pH gradients. The apohemopexin formed is rapidly released from the membranes. The accumulation of heme is saturable and is affected by pH and temperature with maximum uptake occurring between pH 5.5 and 6.5 and at 30 degrees C. Interestingly, much more heme (approximately 25 pmol/mg of membrane protein) is accumulated than hemopexin at saturation, implying that the receptor can turn over several times and that a heme-binding component exists in the rabbit liver plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1498938399,"Fluorescent probes covalently bound to actin or to the actin binding protein, brevin, have been utilized to provide information about actin filaments formed in the presence of brevin as well as about the effect of brevin on the rate of polymerization. At actin to brevin ratios of 10:1 to 100:1, the observed diffusion coefficients of filaments, as measured by fluorescence photobleaching recovery using rhodamine-labeled actin or fluorescein-labeled brevin, are similar to those calculated from theoretical considerations for rigid rods. At lower brevin concentrations, the observed diffusion coefficients for actin filaments are lower than predicted, indicating that the filament structure is closer to that observed in the absence of brevin where filaments are immobilized due to interactions between them. The fluorescein-labeled brevin was found to be about as effective in influencing actin polymerization as unlabeled brevin. Using pyrene-labeled actin, we show that brevin binds 2 mol of monomeric actin. We conclude that at sufficiently high brevin concentration there is one brevin molecule per actin filament. From measurements of the initial rate of polymerization at 5.9 microM actin in the presence of brevin, we calculate both the apparent elongation rate constant and dissociation rate constant from one end (presumably the slow-growing end) of the actin filament. The former is highly dependent on Mg2+ concentration while the latter is not."
https://openalex.org/W1521081650,"Abstract Four proteins have been extracted from purified chromatin of wheat embryos with 0.35 M NaCl. These proteins are soluble in 2% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and thus meet the original operational requirements to be classified as high-mobility group (HMG) chromosomal proteins. The proteins have been characterized by one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis, amino acid analysis, and peptide mapping. Three of the proteins (HMGb, c, and d) share the mammalian HMG characteristic of being rich in both acidic and basic amino acid residues. Unlike their putative mammalian counterparts, these plant HMG proteins contain less than 7 mol % proline. The fourth wheat protein (HMGa) is rich in both proline and in basic amino acid residues. This wheat protein, however, contains only about half the proportion of acidic residues found in mammalian HMG proteins--a characteristic also found in the trout testis HMG protein, H6. Comparative peptide maps show that none of the wheat HMG proteins are degradation products of other HMG proteins or the H1 histones. The peptide maps have not, however, been useful in establishing homologies with mammalian HMG proteins. Wheat HMG proteins are released from DNase I-treated nuclei and co-isolate with micrococcal nuclease-sensitive chromatin fractions. Similar observations concerning the HMG proteins of vertebrate animals have been considered consistent with a role for these proteins as structural components of actively transcribed chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1977238473,"The nucleotide sequences of the two 5'-homology blocks of human alpha-globin gene duplication units were determined. The sequence difference between the two blocks is essentially zero in the 5' portions, and increases gradually toward the 3' ends until it reaches a value of 18 percent. This gradient of sequence divergence is similar to the distribution of the frequencies of gene conversion along several loci in Ascobolus and yeast. Hot spots for initiation of gene correction processes appear to exist near the 5' ends of the human alpha-globin duplication units. The data provide the physical evidence for polar gene correction process in a mammalian genome."
https://openalex.org/W1576952319,"The fluorescent nucleotides epsilon ADP and epsilon ATP were used to study the binding and hydrolysis mechanisms of subfragment 1 (S-1) and acto-subfragment 1 from striated and smooth muscle. The quenching of the enhanced fluorescence emission of bound nucleotide by acrylamide analyzed either by the Stern-Volmer method or by fluorescence lifetime measurements showed the presence of two bound nucleotide states for 1-N6-ethenoadenosine triphosphate (epsilon ATP), 1-N6-ethenoadenosine diphosphate (epsilon ADP), and epsilon ADP-vanadate complexes with S-1. The equilibrium constant relating the two bound nucleotide states was close to unity. Transient kinetic studies showed two first-order transitions with rate constants of approximately 500 and 100 s-1 for both epsilon ATP and epsilon ADP and striated muscle S-1 and 300 and 30 s-1, respectively, for smooth muscle S-1. The hydrolysis of [gamma-32P] epsilon ATP yielded a transient phase of small amplitude (less than 0.2 mol/site) with a rate constant of 5-10 s-1. Consequently, the hydrolysis of the substrate is a step in the mechanism which is distinct from the two conformational changes induced by the binding of epsilon ATP. An essentially symmetric reaction mechanism is proposed in which two structural changes accompany substrate binding and the reversal of these steps occurs in product release. epsilon ATP dissociates acto-S-1 as effectively as ATP. For smooth muscle acto-S-1, dissociation proceeds in two steps, each accompanied by enhancement of fluorescence emission. A symmetric reaction scheme is proposed for the acto-S-1 epsilon ATPase cycle. The very similar kinetic properties of the reactions of epsilon ATP and ATP with S-1 and acto-S-1 suggest that two ATP intermediate states also occur in the ATPase reaction mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1484489075,"C4b-binding protein is a regulator of the classical pathway of the complement system, acting as a cofactor to the serine protease factor I in the degradation of C4b. Its molecular weight is approximately 570,000 and it is composed of multiple, disulfide-linked 70-kDa subunits. Visualized by electron microscopy (Dahlback, B., Smith, C. A., and Muller-Eberhard, H. J. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 3641-3645), it has an unusual spider-like structure with multiple thin (30 A), elongated (330 A) tentacles. The number of tentacles was estimated to be seven. Limited proteolysis by chymotrypsin produces fragments of approximately 50- and 160-kDa, the latter composed of multiple, disulfide-linked, 25-kDa polypeptides. We now have isolated the undenatured C4b-binding protein fragments formed by treatment of the protein with chymotrypsin and have visualized them by electron microscopy. The 160-kDa fragment comprises the central portion of the C4b-binding protein, which appears as a ringlike structure with an inner diameter of 13 A and an outer diameter of 60 A and having attached an approximately 40-A long piece of each tentacle. The liberated 50-kDa fragment constitutes the major part (290-A long) of the tentacles. Chymotrypsin digestion of C4b-binding protein was also monitored as a function of time by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the number of subunits cleaved was found to be seven, supporting our previous ultrastructural data which suggested that C4b-binding protein contains seven identical tentacle-like subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1569622146,"When bovine brain tubulin purified in the absence of GTP and MgCl2 is reacted with N,N'-ethylene-bis(iodoacetamide) (EBI), a bifunctional analogue of iodoacetamide, three new electrophoretically distinct species of tubulin are generated, migrating ahead of beta 1-tubulin on gels containing Na dodecyl sulfate. All three bands appear to be derived from the beta 1 subunit of tubulin and not from the alpha or beta 2 subunit. Accordingly, the bands have been designated beta 1 s, beta 1, and beta 1s in order of increasing electrophoretic mobility. EBI appears to introduce two intrachain cross-links into beta 1-tubulin; the beta 1s band contains one of these cross-links, designated beta s, the beta 1 band contains the other cross-link, designated beta s, and the beta 1 s band contains both cross-links. Both cross-links appear to involve sulfhydryl groups. Colchicine, podophyllotoxin, and nocodazole completely inhibit beta formation while GTP, vinblastine, and maytansine enhance it. It contrast, formation of beta s is completely blocked by guanine nucleotides and by maytansine, while vinblastine inhibits this by 70%. Colchicine, podophyllotoxin, and nocodazole enhance beta s formation. These results show that tubulin has the unusual property of having two discrete sites which can be targeted by an alkylating agent with each site having its alkylation inhibited by a different set of ligands. The results are consistent with several models, including one where vinblastine and maytansine have overlapping binding sites on the beta-subunit of tubulin relatively close to the GTP binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1549666314,"Calsequestrin (Mr = 44,000) is a calcium-binding (KD congruent to 1 mM, congruent to 50 sites/molecule) protein found in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. The 1H NMR spectrum of calsequestrin in the calcium-free form is presented and is characteristic of a protein largely in the random coil configuration. A number of peaks in the aromatic region have been assigned based on their chemical shifts and sensitivity to pH. The interaction of this protein with Ca2+ and K+ was studied by 1H NMR. Potassium ion binding to calsequestrin caused broadening and concomitant loss of intensity in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions of the spectrum. Calcium ion binding caused similar effects but at much lower metal ion concentrations. It was found that the binding of Ca2+ to calsequestrin was cooperative (Hill coefficient n = 2.9 +/- 0.2) with a dissociation constant of 0.25 +/- 0.06 mM in the absence of K+. In contrast, K+ showed binding to a single class of independent sites (KD = 0.20 +/- 0.04 M). Calcium binding was also studied by circular dichroism at protein concentrations similar to the NMR experiments. The binding profile and cooperativity (n = 2.0 +/- 0.1, KD = 0.19 +/- 0.04 mM) were in agreement with the 1H NMR results. Circular dichroism studies performed at low protein concentrations to reduce the possible effect of calcium binding on the concentration of free calcium gave similar values of n = 2.42 +/- 0.14 and KD = 0.21 +/- 0.005 mM. This cooperativity was also observed in the presence of 100 mM KCl although the affinity for calcium has been significantly reduced (n = 1.65 +/- 0.09, KD = 0.87 +/- 0.036 mM). In view of the large number of calcium binding sites in calsequestrin, these small Hill coefficients show that calcium binding to calsequestrin is only mildly cooperative."
https://openalex.org/W1600377681,"Colchicine fluoresces when bound to tubulin but not in water, dioxane, or benzene. The basis of the fluorescence has now been investigated. Colchicine fluoresces in higher alcohols and shows a blue shift as a function of chain length. Glycerol produces a higher fluorescence efficiency and a further blue shift. Plots of 1/fluorescence versus T/eta yield straight lines for both alcohols and glycerol/water mixtures. Fluorescence in glycerol/dimethyl sulfoxide mixtures, in which the dielectric constant remains unchanged, varies as a function of solvent viscosity. Even highly nonpolar solvents such as dioxane require a threshold viscosity for fluorescence to occur. When solvent polarity was decreased at constant viscosity, there was also an enhancement of colchicine fluorescence, but this effect appeared to be smaller than that obtained with increasing viscosity. Immobilization by covalent attachment of desacetylcolchicine to thyroglobulin, serum albumin, or lysozyme also promotes fluorescence from the drug. By contrast, the highly rigid analogue of colchicine, imerubine, fluoresces in water and is unaffected by viscosity changes. We concluded that a major contribution to colchicine fluorescence stems from immobilization of colchicine in the site and that this response to immobilization depends, in part, on the partially flexible nature of the drug. Since certain other flexible molecules such as auramine O, reduced flavines, and diarylalkanes also require increased viscosity or binding to macromolecules to fluoresce at room temperature, we propose that immobilization-enhanced fluorescence may be more common than heretofore believed."

The immunity was delivered in the milk; substantial resistance was conferred on normal rat pups suckled for only 24 hours by a Trichinella-immune foster mother. The pups were protected by oral or systemic administration of specific serum antibodies. When infused into a normal lactating dam, these antibodies accumulated in the serum of her suckling pups."
https://openalex.org/W2113971994,"In a previous paper (Pearlmutter, A. F., Constantini, M. G., and Loeser, B. (1983) Peptides 4, 335-341), we have shown that saturable, high-affinity binding sites for [3H]arginine vasopressin (AVP) are located in rat brain membrane preparations. Binding was dependent upon the presence of Ni2+ and could be dissociated by EDTA. In the hippocampus, [3H]AVP binding could be localized to synaptic membranes. In this paper, we characterize in more depth the specificity of [3H]AVP binding to a crude hippocampal synaptic preparation and the metabolism of [3H]AVP in our synaptic preparation. By means of HPLC analysis we demonstrate that the radioactive material specifically bound to hippocampal synaptic membranes is intact [3H]AVP. The ability of analogues of AVP to displace the high-affinity, specific binding of [3H]AVP parallels closely the potency of these analogues to inhibit the extinction of avoidance behavior. In the presence of membrane and Ni2+, [3H]AVP has a half-life of 7 h. In the absence of Ni2+, the half-life of [3H]AVP is 1.2 h. Fractionation by high-pressure liquid chromatography of the supernatant from the incubation media not containing Ni2+ yields three peaks of radioactivity. Analysis of the biological activity of the [3H]AVP peak and the two non-AVP peaks which represent breakdown products show the following: (a) the [3H]AVP peak (52%) and peak III (8%) bind to fresh membranes and (b) peak II (40%) has no binding activity. Although Ni2+, Co2+, benzamidine, and phenanthroline can prevent [3H]AVP degradation, only Ni2+ and, to a much lesser extent, Co2+, can potentiate specific [3H]AVP binding. The results show that AVP-specific binding has properties which parallel its biological activity in behavioral assays; that, ultimately, proteolysis by membrane-bound peptidases inactivates AVP; and that Ni2+ acts both by preventing AVP breakdown and by potentiating specific binding."

Two changes were observed that contributed to an overall shortening of the mean open time of single-channels. First, there was a shift in the relative proportions of two receptor types with different conductances and mean open times, such that the contribution of receptors with large conductance and short open time increased as development proceeded. Second, there was a sharp reduction in the mean open time of channels having small conductance, with no similar change in channels having large conductance."
https://openalex.org/W1576475855,"A previous paper (Ueno, K., Ohsawa, F., and Natori, S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 12210-12214) showed that a storage protein receptor is present in membranes of the pupal fat body of Sarcophaga peregrina, whereas membranes of the larval fat body contain a cryptic receptor, and that 20-hydroxyecdysone is essential for activation of the cryptic receptor to bind and incorporate the storage protein. The present paper reports that the storage protein receptor is a membrane protein of the pupal fat body with a molecular mass of 120 kilodaltons, and that the cryptic receptor present in membranes of the larval fat body is a precursor of the active receptor with a molecular mass of 125 kilodaltons. It is suggested that when 20-hydroxyecdysone is secreted, it activates the process of conversion of the 125-kDa protein to the 120-kDa protein. Concomitant protein synthesis was not apparently necessary for activation of the storage protein receptor, suggesting that the target of 20-hydroxyecdysone in this case is the fat body membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1501616315,"28Mg2+ influx studies in S49 murine lymphoma cells indicate that only 2-3% of total cell Mg2+ content can be exchanged at isotopic equilibrium, implying compartmentation of the newly transported Mg2+. The nature of this compartmentation was examined using selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane with the detergent, digitonin. Control experiments demonstrated that the digitonin permeabilization procedure did not release mitochondrial and lysosomal components, alter mitochondrial respiration, or significantly change cell morphology. Thus, under appropriate conditions, the digitonin permeabilization technique allows determination of the amount of a particular cell constituent within the solute space of the cytoplasm. In nonproliferating cells at an extracellular Mg2+ concentration of 0.1 mM, newly transported Mg2+ equilibrates within 2 h with a small cytoplasmic Mg2+ pool comprising about 3% of the total cytoplasmic Mg2+ (about 2% of total cell Mg2+). The pool of Mg2+ does not equilibrate with bulk cytoplasmic or cellular Mg2+ for at least 16 h. The Mg2+ pool size is dependent on extra-cellular Mg2+ concentration, is saturable with increasing extracellular Mg2+, and reaches a maximal size of 6-7% of total cell Mg2+ at 2 mM extracellular Mg2+. Unlike Mg2+, newly transported Ca2+ is quickly sequestered in noncytoplasmic compartments. In proliferating cells, however, newly transported Mg2+ exchanges extensively with cytoplasmic Mg2+ over the course of 4 h, suggesting that compartmentation of Mg2+ may be dependent on proliferative status."
https://openalex.org/W1518161519,"The incorporation of fatty acids into gastric mucus glycoproteins was studied by incubating rat gastric mucosal cell suspensions with [9,10-3H]palmitic acid and [3H]proline. The mucus glycoprotein polymer, secreted into the growth medium (extracellular) and that contained within the cells (intracellular), was purified from the other components of the secretion, thoroughly delipidated, and then analyzed for the radiolabeled tracers. Both pools of mucus glycoprotein, incubated in the presence of [3H]palmitic acid, contained radioactive label which could not be removed by gel filtration, CsCl density gradient centrifugation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, or lipid extraction. Treatment of the purified mucus glycoprotein with 1 M hydroxylamine or 0.3 M methanolic KOH released the radioactivity, thus indicating that [3H]palmitic acid was covalently bound by ester linkage to the glycoprotein. The released radioactivity was associated mainly (87%) with palmitic acid. The incorporation ratio of [3H]proline to [3H]palmitic acid was 0.12:1.0 in the extracellular glycoprotein and 1.38:1.0 in the intracellular glycoprotein, which suggested that acylation of mucus glycoprotein occurs in the intracellular compartment after completion of its polypeptide core. The fact that incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid was greater in the glycoprotein subunits than in the glycoprotein polymer indicates that acylation takes place near the end of subunit processing but before their assembly into the high molecular weight mucus glycoprotein polymer."
https://openalex.org/W1547038432,"Abstract An in vitro model system including wild-type T4 DNA polymerase, the mutagenic nucleotide analogue 2-aminopurine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, and poly[d(A,C)] X oligo(dT) poly(dC) X oligo(dG) template-primers is used to measure the frequency of 2-aminopurine X cytosine base mispairs formed in the G X C----A X T mutational pathway. Incorporation and turnover of the analogue into DNA is dependent on the presence of cytosine on the template strand and is reduced significantly in the presence of dGTP. 2-Aminopurine X cytosine mispairs are observed to occur at a 2-3 order of magnitude greater frequency than adenine X cytosine mispairs. The frequency of inserting 2-aminopurine deoxyribonucleoside monophosphate in place of dGMP opposite template cytosine sites is about 3-6% when either strong or weak base-stacking partners are present on the primer strand. However, enzymatic proofreading of the mispair strongly depends on base-stacking partners. Greater than 85% of misinserted 2-aminopurine deoxynucleotides are excised whenever the mispairs are formed next to 5'-primer thymine sites. A 5-fold reduction in proofreading frequency occurs when the mispair is formed with 2-aminopurine deoxynucleoside monophosphate stacked adjacent to a 5'-primer guanine. The frequency of 2-aminopurine X cytosine base mispair formation in the G X C----A X T pathway is similar to that found previously in the A X T----G X C pathway (Watanabe, S. M., and Goodman, M.F. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 2864-2868). We propose a criterion for base selection by DNA polymerase to account for the unexpected similarity in base mispairing rates in the two transition pathways."

This receptor-modifying, intranuclear event is independent of receptor loss (processing) and appears associated with hormone responsiveness (progesterone-receptor induction) in these cells. The magnitude of receptor loss, however, is variable and apparently not a prerequisite for hormone action to induce progesterone receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1563759004,"Supernatant protein factor (SPF), a cytosolic protein (Mr = 47,000) stimulates microsomal squalene epoxidase activity 4- to 10-fold in the presence of anionic phospholipid such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (Saat, Y., and Bloch, K. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5155-5160). This effect has been ascribed to substrate translocation from inactive to active pools within the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (Friedlander, E. J., Caras, I. W., Lin, L. F. H., and Bloch, K. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8042-8045). Here we show that SPF and PG also stimulate squalene uptake per se by microsomes as well as stimulate squalene epoxidase. Microsomes preloaded with substrate in the presence of SPF and PG show full epoxidase activity. They do not require further addition of these factors during enzyme assay. Addition of SPF and PG to assay mixtures containing microsomes preloaded with substrate in the presence of SPF and PG did not further increase epoxidase activity. We also show that PG tightly binds to microsomes. This binding of PG is essential for the response of microsomal epoxidase to SPF. Solubilized microsomal enzymes have been reconstituted and show high epoxidase activity. In this system, SPF and PG do not stimulate the conversion of squalene into products."
https://openalex.org/W1570051767,"The action of purified N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase (muramidase, EC 3.2.1.17) of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 9790 on linear, uncross-linked, soluble, peptidoglycan chains produced by the same organism in the presence of benzylpenicillin was characterized as a processive exodisaccharidase. Specific labels, one [( 14C]Gal) added to the nonreducing ends of chains, and the other (3H from [3H]NaBH4) incorporated into the reducing ends of the chains, were used to establish that an enzyme molecule binds at the nonreducing terminus and sequentially hydrolyzes the glycosidic bonds, releasing disaccharide-peptide units. An enzyme molecule remains bond to a chain, and is not released at a detectable rate, until hydrolysis of that chain is complete. Reaction rates increased with the length of the polymer chain to give a maximum of 91 bonds cleaved/min/enzyme molecule for hydrolysis of a continuous polymeric substrate. The relationship between hydrolytic rate and glycan chain length is consistent with hydrolysis of bonds within the chain followed by slow release of enzyme from the distal, reducing terminus. This mechanism was experimentally confirmed by analysis of product formation during hydrolysis with stoichiometric mixtures of enzyme and soluble peptidoglycan chains. Kinetic analyses showed an apparent Km of 0.17 microM for the enzyme, independent of substrate polymer length. The dissociation constant for the initial enzyme-substrate complex was calculated to be 1.5 nM. Kinetic analyses are consistent with one catalytic site per enzyme molecule. The Kcat/Km value of 9 X 10(6) M-1 S-1 is near the limit imposed by diffusion for the initial hydrolytic events when long chains are hydrolyzed. The kinetic and physical properties of this muramidase are highly consistent with its location outside of the cellular permeability barrier and its ability to remain with and hydrolyze appropriate bonds in the cell wall in such an environment."

These procedures allowed a 14% recovery of enzyme activity. The molecular weight of the enzyme, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is 38,500. The isoelectric point, as determined by preparative and analytical flat-bed isoelectrofocusing, is 4.5; the pH optimum is 7.0. N,O-Acyltransferase showed a Km for N-hydroxy-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene of 6.3 X 10(-6) M with a Vmax of 10.4 nmol of aminofluorene bound to tRNA/min/mg of protein. Activity was not inhibited by the esterase inhibitor paraoxon. Rat liver N,O-acyltransferase is an enzyme that is very unstable, due in part to labile sulfhydryl groups which easily oxidize in air. The enzyme cannot, however, be fully stabilized with the addition of dithiothreitol."
https://openalex.org/W1547171636,"It has been assumed that following hepatic uptake, bilirubin is bound exclusively to cytosolic proteins prior to conjugation by microsomal UDP-glucuronyl-transferase. Since bilirubin partitions into lipid rather than the aqueous phase at neutral pH, we postulated that bilirubin reaches the sites of glucuronidation by rapid diffusion within membranes. To examine this hypothesis, [14C]bilirubin was incorporated into the membrane bilayer of small unilamellar liposomes of egg phosphatidylcholine. Radiochemical assay of this membrane-bound substrate in a physiologic concentration, using native rat liver microsomes, demonstrated immediate formation of bilirubin glucuronides at a more rapid initial velocity than for bilirubin bound to the high-affinity sites of purified cytosolic binding proteins, i.e. glutathione S-transferases (p less than 0.025) or native liver cytosol (p less than 0.05). Kinetic analysis suggested that the mechanisms of substrate transfer from liposomal membranes and from purified glutathione S-transferases to microsomal UDP-glucuronyltransferase were similar. The exchange of 3H- and 14C-labeled bilirubin substrate between binding proteins and liposomal membranes was then investigated using Sepharose 4B chromatography. As the concentration of bilirubin was increased relative to that of protein, net transfer of substrate from the protein to the membrane pool was observed. These findings indicate that bilirubin is efficiently transported by membrane-membrane transfer to hepatic microsomes, where it undergoes rapid conjugation. Bilirubin entering hepatocytes may partition between membrane and cytosolic protein pools, but as intracellular bilirubin concentration increases, the membrane pool is likely to provide a greater proportion of the substrate for glucuronidation."
https://openalex.org/W1551928272,"The interaction of microtubule-associated proteins with actin filaments has been investigated by measuring the diffusion coefficient of either the filament or the microtubule-associated proteins. Experiments were performed using the technique of fluorescence photobleaching recovery with actin labeled with iodoacetamidotetramethyl rhodamine or microtubule-associated proteins labeled with iodoacetamidofluorescein. Actin filaments composed of pure rhodamine-labeled actin are not immobilized under a variety of conditions (Tait, J. F., and Frieden, C. (1982c) Biochemistry 21, 6046-6053). We find that addition of microtubule-associated proteins to rhodamine-labeled actin in a ratio as low as 1:1000 can cause immobilization, presumably cross-linking actin into a network of nondiffusible filaments. Immobilization occurs after polymerization is complete, suggesting either a length redistribution of actin filaments, a redistribution of the cross-links between filaments, or the slow addition of actin filaments to other filaments via the microtubule-associated protein. Experiments using fluorescein-labeled microtubule-associated proteins show that these proteins are bound to actin filaments as they are formed and that binding depended on actin concentration, indicating that there are a number of binding sites on the actin filaments. However, while the actin filaments become completely immobilized, the microtubule-associated proteins become only partially immobilized suggesting at least two different classes of binding affinities. The large peptide obtained from trypsin-treated fluorescein-labeled microtubule-associated proteins is not able to immobilize actin filaments since it does not bind to the filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1493497927,"Very amphiphilic proteins with a high tendency to self-aggregate may exist in an aggregated form even in the presence of detergents or denaturants. In order to mitigate the tendency towards self-association, it is necessary to eliminate the amphiphilicity of these proteins. In order to achieve this end, proteins were modified covalently, first by dinitrophenylation followed by permethylation, which rendered the proteins tested soluble in nonpolar organic solvents, such as chloroform/methanol (4/1, v/v). The permethylated 2,4-dinitrophenyl-proteins were then chromatographed using Sepharose CL-6B in chloroform/methanol (4/1, v/v). For ten commonly used molecular weight marker proteins, a single symmetrical peak was obtained in the elution profile of the modified proteins, indicating that these products are monodisperse with respect to molecular size. The one exception was gamma globulin which has two polypeptide chains, and thus the elution profile showed two symmetrical peaks. The KD value was found to be a linear function of the logarithm of the molecular weight of the parent protein. From the calibration line generated from the molecular weight marker proteins, the technique was applied to five highly amphiphilic proteins: bacteriorrhodopsin, uricase, insecticyanin, apolipoprotein B of plasma low density lipoproteins, and band 3 of human erythrocyte membrane, for which the following apparent molecular weights were obtained: 25,000, 31,000, 23,400, 19,000, and 85,000, respectively. These values match the molecular weights obtained from the amino acid sequence in those cases in which the sequence is known. Thus, permethylation in conjunction with organic media disrupts the major driving forces for tertiary and quarternary structure formation in aqueous media, namely, the hydrophobic effect, salt bridges, and hydrogen bonding with the solvent."
https://openalex.org/W1972919106,"Although a binomial model gives an adequate description of the release properties of central afferent synapses, slight differences between experimental and predicted probability density functions are observed, with an excess number of responses recorded around the means. These discrepancies can be quantified by comparing experimental and theoretical entropies, which could relate to information transfer at these junctions. A model, based on the experimentally supported assumption that the postsynaptic membrane functions as a nonlinear processor, minimizes the differences between the distributions of the recorded and predicted potentials. According to this model, the nonlinearity is due to a localized interaction between the effects of simultaneously activated adjacent synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1510290397,"A quantitative microdensitometric study has been designed to characterize in situ intestinal brush border-bound alkaline phosphatase of rat duodenal villosities. Intestinal slices were incubated with beta-glycerophosphate as substrate. Free phosphate liberated was precipitated in presence of a lead reagent as lead sulfide. The precipitate was quantified in situ by scanning and integrating microdensitometry. Kinetic parameters of the reaction were determined at 37 degrees C, pH 8.8, in the middle part of the villosities. Apparent Michaelis constant (Km) for beta-glycerophosphate was found to be 8.16 +/- 0.56 mM (mean +/- S.E.). Maximal enzyme activation was obtained at pH 8.5. Maximal inhibition of enzyme activity was observed in the presence of L-phenylalanine (30 mM) or theophylline (5 mM). Along the villosity axis, enzyme activity rose from the crypt up to the midportion of the villosity and finally decreased at the tip region. In phosphate-depleted rats, enzyme activity was increased in all portions of the villosity, with conservation of the same activity gradient. In this situation, kinetic analysis showed a marked decrease of Km, i.e. 4.56 +/- 0.39 mM (mean +/- S.E.) as compared to normal rats."

It appears that the anticancer activity of bimolane is due to ICRF-154.
https://openalex.org/W1555519883,"NAD-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase from pig heart is composed of three dissimilar subunits present in the native enzyme as 2 alpha:1 beta: 1 gamma, with a tetramer being the smallest form of complete enzyme. The role of these subunits has been explored using affinity labeling. Specifically labeled subunits are separated and then recombined with unmodified subunits to form dimers. Recombination of beta or gamma subunits modified by the isocitrate analogues, 3-bromo-2-ketoglutarate and 3,4-didehydro-2-ketoglutarate, with unmodified alpha subunit led to the same activity in the dimer as when unmodified beta or gamma was combined with alpha. Contrastingly, modification of alpha with these isocitrate analogues led to loss in activity either alone or when recombined with beta or gamma. Hence, the isocitrate site on alpha is required for catalytic activity but the isocitrate sites on beta or gamma are not necessary for the activity of the functional dimer. Reaction of isolated subunits with 3-bromo-2-ketoglutarate shows that alpha and the alpha beta dimer are modified at about the same rate as holoenzyme, suggestive of similarity of the isocitrate site in native enzyme and in isolated active entities containing alpha subunit; in contrast, beta and gamma subunits react more slowly. Modification by the 2‘,3‘-dialdehyde derivative of the allosteric effector, ADP, led to loss of activity in reconstituted dimers, independent of which subunit was modified. Reaction of isolated subunits with the dialdehyde derivative of ADP is slow compared to the initial reaction with native enzyme, indicating differences in the effects of ADP on intact enzyme and subunits. The ADP sites on all subunits may thus be important in intersubunit interactions, which in turn modulate catalytic activity."
