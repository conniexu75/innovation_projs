https://openalex.org/W3038505425,"On 21 February 2020, a resident of the municipality of Vo’, a small town near Padua (Italy), died of pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection1. This was the first coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-related death detected in Italy since the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province2. In response, the regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole municipality for 14 days3. Here we collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo’ at two consecutive time points. From the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1–3.3%). From the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI: 0.8–1.8%). Notably, 42.5% (95% CI: 31.5–54.6%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic (that is, did not have symptoms at the time of swab testing and did not develop symptoms afterwards). The mean serial interval was 7.2 days (95% CI: 5.9–9.6). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (P = 0.62 and 0.74 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, exact Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test). This study sheds light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides insights into its transmission dynamics and the efficacy of the implemented control measures. The authors describe the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral load and the frequency of symptomatic versus asymptomatic and presymptomatic infection in an Italian town, before and after a strict 14-day lockdown."

However, the immunological mechanisms responsible for severe inflammatory side effects remain poorly understood. Here we report a comprehensive single-cell analysis of immune cell populations in colitis, a common and severe side effect of checkpoint blockade. We observed a striking accumulation of CD8 T cells with highly cytotoxic and proliferative states and no evidence of regulatory T cell depletion. T cell receptor (TCR) sequence analysis demonstrated that a substantial fraction of colitis-associated CD8 T cells originated from tissue-resident populations, explaining the frequently early onset of colitis symptoms following treatment initiation. Our analysis also identified cytokines, chemokines, and surface receptors that could serve as therapeutic targets for colitis and potentially other inflammatory side effects of checkpoint blockade."
https://openalex.org/W3038167169,"The All of Us Research Program (All of Us) is a national effort to accelerate health research by exploring the relationship between lifestyle, environment, and genetics. It is set to become one of the largest research efforts in U.S. history, aiming to build a national resource of data from at least one million participants. All of Us aims to address the need for more diversity in research and set the stage for that diversity to be leveraged in precision medicine research to come. This paper describes how the program assessed demographic characteristics of participants who have enrolled in other U.S. biomedical research cohorts to better understand which groups are traditionally represented or underrepresented in biomedical research. We 1) reviewed the enrollment characteristics of national cohort studies like All of Us, and 2) surveyed the literature, focusing on key diversity categories essential to the program's enrollment aims. Based on these efforts, All of Us emphasizes enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities, and has formally designated the following additional groups as historically underrepresented: individuals-with inadequate access to medical care; under the age of 18 or over 65; with an annual household income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level; who have a cognitive or physical disability; have less than a high school education or equivalent; are intersex; identify as a sexual or gender minority; or live in rural or non-metropolitan areas. Research accounting for wider demographic variability is critical. Only by ensuring diversity and by addressing the very barriers that limit it, can we position All of Us to better understand and tackle health disparities."
https://openalex.org/W3037608718,"A major obstacle to treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) is our lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying selective neuronal vulnerability, a key characteristic of the disease. Here, we present a framework integrating high-quality neuron-type-specific molecular profiles across the lifetime of the healthy mouse, which we generated using bacTRAP, with postmortem human functional genomics and quantitative genetics data. We demonstrate human-mouse conservation of cellular taxonomy at the molecular level for neurons vulnerable and resistant in AD, identify specific genes and pathways associated with AD neuropathology, and pinpoint a specific functional gene module underlying selective vulnerability, enriched in processes associated with axonal remodeling, and affected by amyloid accumulation and aging. We have made all cell-type-specific profiles and functional networks available at http://alz.princeton.edu. Overall, our study provides a molecular framework for understanding the complex interplay between Aβ, aging, and neurodegeneration within the most vulnerable neurons in AD."
https://openalex.org/W3039400731,"A lack of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs) during the COVID-19 crisis has placed healthcare workers at risk. It is important for any N95 reuse strategy to determine the effects that proposed protocols would have on the physical functioning of the mask, as well as the practical aspects of implementation. Here we propose and implement a method of heating N95 respirators with moisture (85°C, 60-85% humidity). We test both mask filtration efficiency and fit to validate this process. Our tests focus on the 3M 1860, 3M 1870, and 3M 8210 Plus N95 models. After five cycles of the heating procedure, all three respirators pass both quantitative fit testing (score of >100) and show no degradation of mask filtration efficiency. We also test the Chen Heng V9501 KN95 and HKYQ N95 finding no degradation of mask filtration efficiency, however even for unheated masks these scored <50 for every fit test. The heating method presented here is scalable from individual masks to over a thousand a day with a single industrial convection oven, making this method practical for local application inside health-care facilities."

Lack of skills and knowledge on the part of health care providers have a negative effect on their access to care and health outcomes. This study 1) explores the knowledge and attitudes of medical students regarding LGBT people, and 2) assesses the impact of a one-hour lecture targeting adolescent LGBT health needs.Fourth-year medical students attended a compulsory one-hour lecture on sexual orientation and gender identity development in adolescence, highlighting health issues. We created a questionnaire with items to elicit students' knowledge and attitudes about LGBT health issues. Students were invited to complete this questionnaire online anonymously one week before the lecture and one month after the lecture.Out of a total of 157 students, 107 (68.2%) responded to the pre-intervention questionnaire and 96 (61.1%) to the post-intervention questionnaire. A significant proportion-13.7% of all respondents-identified as LGBT or questioning. Our results show that most medical students already show favorable attitudes towards LGBT people and a certain degree of knowledge of LGBT health needs. They demonstrated a large and significant increase in knowledge of LGBT health issues one month after the lecture.A single one-hour lecture on sexual orientation and LGBT health issues may increase knowledge among medical students. Medical students and professionals should receive such training to increase their knowledge about LGBT patients as it, together with favorable attitudes, has the potential to improve health outcomes among this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W3039692448,"Autophagy has been shown to maintain neural system homeostasis during stroke. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal autophagy in ischemic stroke remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the pathway consisting of MEG3 (maternally expressed gene 3), microRNA-378 (miR-378), and GRB2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) in neuronal autophagy and neurological functional impairment in ischemic stroke. A mouse model of the middle cerebral artery occluded–induced ischemic stroke and an in vitro model of oxygen-glucose deprivation–induced neuronal injury were developed. To understand the role of the MEG3/miR-378/GRB2 axis in the neuronal regulation, the expression of proteins associated with autophagy in neurons was measured by Western blotting analysis, and neuron death was evaluated using a lactate dehydrogenase leakage rate test. First, it was found that the GRB2 gene, up-regulated in middle cerebral artery occluded–operated mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation–exposed neurons, was a target gene of miR-378. Next, miR-378 inhibited neuronal loss and neurological functional impairment in mice, as well as neuronal autophagy and neuronal death by silencing of GRB2. Confirmatory in vitro experiments showed that MEG3 could specifically bind to miR-378 and subsequently up-regulate the expression of GRB2, which in turn suppressed the activation of Akt/mTOR pathway. Taken together, these findings suggested that miR-378 might protect against neuronal autophagy and neurological functional impairment and proposed that a MEG3/miR-378/GRB2 regulatory axis contributed to better understanding of the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke.

Stroke, a principal cause of disability and the second leading cause of death in the world, affects an estimated 17 million people each year, of which most are ischemic stroke (1Santos H.N.

Data from China and other countries show an increase in the incidence of ischemic stroke in men compared with women less than 80 years old; however, most stroke patients over 80 years old are women (5Wang D.

After suffering an ischemic stroke, patients often have a poor prognosis, failing to regain independence and requiring long-term care (7Bushnell C.D. Reeves M.J. Zhao X. Pan W. Prvu-Bettger J. Zimmer L. Olson D. Peterson E. Sex differences in quality of life after ischemic stroke.Neurology. 2014; 82 (24510493): 922-93110.1212/WNL.0000000000000208Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This is attributed to irreversible tissue damage caused by the stroke incident, which often triggers complex cellular biochemical events, ultimately causing necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy of neurons in the ischemic brain (8Shu S. Li C.M. You Y.L. Qian X.L. Zhou S. Ling C.Q. Electroacupuncture ameliorates cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury by regulation of autophagy and apoptosis.Evid. Based Complement. Alternat. Med. 2016; 2016 (27800003): 729742510.1155/2016/7297425Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms underlying stroke-induced neuronal autophagy and neurological functional impairment might be beneficial to the development of new therapeutic targets against ischemic stroke effects. An increasing amount of evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in neural pathological and physiological changes (9Backes C. Meder B. Hart M. Ludwig N. Leidinger P. Vogel B. Galata V. Roth P. Menegatti J. Grässer F. Ruprecht K. Kahraman M. Grossmann T. Haas J.

Many reports of stroke-associated miRNA expression profiles conducted both in vivo and in vitro have surfaced, because dysregulation of miRNAs has been associated with neurological diseases, making this class of RNAs ideal drug candidates for stroke therapies because of their simultaneous regulation of multiple target genes (11Bhalala O.G. Srikanth M. Kessler J.A. The emerging roles of microRNAs in CNS injuries.Nat. Rev.

Interestingly, Zhang et al. (13) have reported that overexpression of miR-378 could protect neurons against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)– or middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAO)–induced ischemic injury by targeting caspase-3. GRB2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) is reported to be a target of miR-378, involving the cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction while long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and pro-cardiac fibrotic lncRNA can bind to miR-378 to impair miR-378–dependent inhibition of GRB2 (14Sun F. Zhuang Y. Zhu H. Wu H. Li D. Zhan L. Yang W. Yuan Y. Xie Y. Yang S. Luo S. Jiang W. Zhang J. Pan Z. Lu Y. lncRNA PCFL promotes cardiac fibrosis via miR-378/GRB2 pathway following myocardial infarction.J. Mol. Cell.

GRB2 is found to be enriched in the mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–Akt, mTOR pathways on the basis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Aggravation or alleviation of OGD-induced neuronal ischemic injury may be associated with the Akt/mTOR pathway-mediated autophagy (15Wei H. Li Y. Han S. Liu S. Zhang N. Zhao L. Li S. Li J. cPKCγ-modulated autophagy in neurons alleviates ischemic injury in brain of mice with ischemic stroke through Akt-mTOR pathway.Transl. Stroke Res. 2016; 7 (27510769): 497-51110.1007/s12975-016-0484-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Another lncRNA, maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), is down-regulated in both MCAO mice and OGD-cultured HT22 cells and has been found to attenuate hypoxia-induced apoptosis of HT22 cells (16Liu X. Hou L. Huang W. Gao Y. Lv X. Tang J. The mechanism of long non-coding RNA MEG3 for neurons apoptosis caused by hypoxia: mediated by miR-181b-12/15-LOX signaling pathway.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2016; 10 (27642276): 20110.3389/fncel.2016.00201Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that miR-378 could target GRB2, which was up-regulated in ischemic stroke samples shown by microarray GSE9391, whereas MEG3 was predicted to bind or occur in a complex with miR-378. Therefore, we investigated the interplay between MEG3, miR-378, and GRB2 in conjunction with the Akt/mTOR pathway in neuronal autophagy and neurological functional impairment caused by ischemic stroke. By analyzing the microarray profile GSE9391, the top 50 differentially expressed genes with the largest fold change are shown in a heat map (Fig. 1A). Among those genes, we found that GRB2 was up-regulated in patients with stroke (Fig. 1A). GRB2 has been reported to have important functions in neurogenesis (17Murase S. Impaired focal adhesion kinase–Grb2 interaction during elevated activity in hippocampal neurons.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015; 16 (26184168): 15659-1566910.3390/ijms160715659Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18Manu M.S. Rachana K.S. Advirao G.M.

KEGG analysis suggested that GRB2 was involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–AKT, and mTOR pathways, and the relationships between those pathways and neurogenesis have been reported in many studies (19Chen Y. Xie H.Q. Sha R. Xu T. Zhang S. Fu H. Xia Y. Liu Y. Xu L.

However, the literature regarding the role of GRB2 in ischemic stroke is sparse. Thus, we selected GRB2 as the focus of subsequent experiments. The neurons were isolated from the cerebral cortex of neonatal suckling mice. The neurons adhered to the well after 1 day of culture. At days 4 and 5, the neurites were gradually elongated and further extended outwards. At the same time, the neurites gradually intertwined and formed a neural network. Neurons were considered mature after 6 days of culture. Immunofluorescence was subsequently conducted to identify mouse neurons with the neuron marker MAP-2 and astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The percentage of MAP-2–positive cells was above 95%, which can be used for subsequent cell experiments. GRB2 was expressed in MAP-2–positive neurons but hardly expressed in GFAP-positive neurons (Fig. 1B). Reverse transcription–quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting assays were conducted to determine the expression pattern of GRB2 in the brain tissues and neurons in the settings of in vivo and in vitro models. In our experiment, mRNA and protein levels of GRB2 were increased significantly in brain tissues of MCAO-operated mice 3 days postoperation (p < 0.05) when compared with those in the normal mice. Compared with control neurons, mRNA and protein levels of GRB2 were consistently increased in OGD-exposed neurons (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, C and D). A TargetScan.org (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_72/) target prediction site shows a potential binding site for miR-378 within the 3´-UTR of the GRB2 gene (Fig. 1E). Hence, we selected miR-378 for further study. The results of Dual-Luciferase reporter assay were conducted to verify this binding relationship in HEK-293T cells. The results showed no significant differences in the luciferase activity of GRB2 MUT–3´-UTR between the NC and miR-378 mimic groups (p > 0.05). The luciferase activity of the GRB2 WT–3´-UTR in the HEK-293T cells transfected with miR-378 mimic was significantly lower than that in the HEK-293T cells transfected with NC (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1F). Therefore, miR-378 could specifically bind to GRB2. Next, RT-qPCR and Western blotting assays were conducted to determine the expression pattern of miR-378 in the brain tissues and neurons in the settings of in vivo and in vitro models. miR-378 was found to be expressed at lower levels in brain tissues of MCAO-operated mice 3 days postoperation, as well as in OGD-exposed neurons (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1G). Through ISH assay, miR-378 was found to be consistently down-regulated in the brain tissues of MCAO-operated mice (Fig. 1H). These data collectively suggested the down-regulation of miR-378 and up-regulation of GRB2 in the settings of both in vivo and in vitro models for ischemic stroke. To verify the regulation of miR-378 and GRB2 in ischemic stroke, miR-378+/− and GRB2+/− mice were generated and were used for miR-378 and GRB2 knockdown experiments. Next, the expression of miR-378 in the transgenic mice was determined by RT-qPCR. Compared with WT mice, miR-378 expression in the brain tissues of miR-378+/− mice was down-regulated, and GRB2 mRNA levels in the brain tissues of GRB2+/− mice were also reduced (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, A and B). The knockdown efficiency of miR-378 was 85.4%, and that of GRB2 was 91.2%. Hence miR-378+/− and GRB2+/− mice can be used in subsequent studies. Next, the GRB2 protein level in the brain tissues of GRB2+/− mice was determined by Western blotting assay and detected using immunohistochemical staining. Compared with WT mice, GRB2 protein level was reduced in the GRB2+/− mice (Fig. 2, C and D). Meanwhile, the miR-378 expression in brain tissues of miR-378+/− mice was detected by ISH assay, the results of which displayed that miR-378 expression was significantly reduced in miR-378+/− mice as compared with WT mice (Fig. 2E). The aforementioned results suggested the successful knockdown of miR-378 and GRB2 in the transgenic mice, which could be used for the following experiments. A mouse model was developed by conducting MCAO in the miR-378+/− and GRB2+/− mice, whereas an in vitro model was induced in the neurons by exposure to OGD. The expression of miR-378 as well as the mRNA and protein levels of GRB2 was determined in the brain tissues MCAO-operated mice and OGD-exposed neurons by RT-qPCR and Western blotting assay. The miR-378 expression was reduced, whereas mRNA and protein levels of GRB2 in brain tissues were up-regulated in the miR-378+/− MCAO group compared with the MCAO group (p < 0.05). The miR-378 expression was increased, but mRNA and protein levels of GRB2 were down-regulated in the miR-378 mimic MCAO group compared with those in the MCAO group (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, F–H). When compared with the OGD model group, miR-378 expression was down-regulated, whereas mRNA and protein levels of GRB2 in neurons were up-regulated in the miR-378 inhibitor OGD group (p < 0.05), and miR-378 was increased, but mRNA and protein levels of GRB2 were down-regulated in the miR-378 mimic OGD group (p < 0.05). These results confirmed that miR-378 negatively regulated GRB2 expression. To confirm the effects of GRB2 and miR-378 on neurological impairment, cerebral infarct size, and neuronal autophagy in ischemic stroke mice, we used miR-378+/− and GRB2+/− mice and infected WT mice with lentiviruses harboring a miR-378 mimic and then established the 1-h MCAO model. Following MCAO induction, neurological deficit scores for MCAO-operated mice were evaluated using the Longa grade point standard at 6, 12, and 24 h after MCAO. Compared with the sham-operated mice, the neurological deficit scores of MCAO-operated mice were increased 24 h post-MCAO, indicating that the MCAO model was successfully established, and neurological function of mice was impaired. The neurological deficit score (24 h post-MCAO) of mice in the miR-378+/− MCAO group was increased significantly, and scores (24 h post-MCAO) of mice in the miR-378 mimic MCAO and GRB2+/− MCAO groups were reduced compared with that of mice in the MCAO group (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). The results of a pole test showed that Tturn and Ttotal of MCAO mice were increased on the 1st and 3rd days in contrast to those of sham mice. Tturn and Ttotal of the miR-378+/− MCAO group were elevated, whereas Tturn and Ttotal of the miR-378 mimic MCAO and GRB2+/− MCAO groups were decreased than those in the MCAO group (p < 0.05). The results of foot fault test indicated that compared with the sham group, the numbers of right foot faults in the MCAO group on the 1st and 3rd days were increased (p < 0.05). The number of right foot faults in the miR-378+/− MCAO group was increased, but those in the miR-378 mimic MCAO and GRB2+/− MCAO group were reduced when compared with the MCAO group (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C). These data indicated that miR-378 knockdown aggravated neurological impairment in the ischemic stroke model induced by MCAO, whereas miR-378 overexpression and GRB2 knockdown retarded neurological impairment. We measured LCBF during MCAO process. LCBF was 100% under the normal condition and gradually reduced to 20% during MCAO process. LCBF was restored to 100% 1 h after the removal of the monofilament. Under the same treatment, LCBF in the miR-378+/− MCAO, GRB2+/−MCAO, and miR-378 mimic MCAO groups showed no differences compared with that in the MCAO group (p > 0.05) (Fig. 3B). After operation of MCAO for 1 h, cerebral infarct size was recorded, and mice in the MCAO group showed a larger LCBF size, but the miR-378 mimic MCAO and GRB2+/− MCAO groups revealed smaller size than the MCAO group (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3D). These results suggested that miR-378 knockdown increased the cerebral infarct size in ischemic stroke, whereas miR-378 overexpression and GRB2 knockdown had the opposite effect, reducing cerebral infarct size, which was not caused by LCBF. Compared with the sham group, neuron loss in the brain tissues in the MCAO group was increased on the 3rd day (p < 0.05). miR-378+/− MCAO mice showed increased neuron loss in the brain tissues, whereas the miR-378 mimic MCAO and GRB2+/− MCAO mice showed reduced neuron loss compared with WT MCAO mice on the 3rd day postsurgery (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3E). Overall, these results showed that miR-378 knockdown increased neuron loss in an ischemic stroke scenario, whereas miR-378 overexpression and consequently GRB2 knockdown reduced neuron loss. To evaluate the effects of GRB2 and miR-378 on neuron autophagy and apoptosis, miR-378 was overexpressed or inhibited, and/or GRB2 was silenced in the primary neurons, which were used for developing OGD models. MDC observation (Fig. 4A) under a fluorescence microscope revealed that the OGD group showed increased intensity of punctate green fluorescence compared with the control group. The miR-378 inhibitor OGD group revealed increased intensity of punctate green fluorescence, whereas the miR-378 mimic OGD, GRB2 siRNA OGD, and miR-378 inhibitor + GRB2 siRNA OGD groups indicated decreased intensity of punctate green fluorescence compared with the OGD model group. The green fluorescence intensity in the miR-378 inhibitor + GRB2 siRNA OGD group was lower than that in the miR-378 inhibitor OGD group and higher than that in the GRB2 siRNA OGD group. LDH leakage rate detection indicated that the OGD model group showed increased neuron death rate (p < 0.05) compared with the control group (Fig. 4, B and C). We found that the miR-378 inhibitor OGD group showed increased neuron death rate at the 24th h (p < 0.05), whereas the miR-378 mimic OGD, GRB2 siRNA OGD, and miR-378 inhibitor + GRB2 siRNA OGD groups indicated increased neuron survival rate and reduced death rate compared with the OGD model group (p < 0.05). The death rate of neurons in the miR-378 inhibitor + GRB2 siRNA OGD group were significantly different from those in the miR-378 inhibitor OGD and GRB2 siRNA OGD groups (p < 0. 05). These results demonstrated that miR-378 knockdown increased formation of autophagic vacuoles and neuron apoptosis in ischemic stroke, whereas miR-378 overexpression and GRB2 knockdown reduced formation of autophagic vacuoles and neuron apoptosis. The results of Western blotting analysis obtained from in vivo experiments indicated that compared with the sham group, the MCAO group showed an increase in the protein levels of Beclin I and LC3-II/(LC3-I + LC3-II) (p < 0.05). In contrast to the MCAO model mice, miR-378+/− MCAO mice showed an increase in protein levels of Beclin I and LC3-II/(LC3-I + LC3-II) in brain tissue on the 3rd day (p < 0.05), but the miR-378 mimic MCAO and GRB2+/− MCAO mice indicated a decrease in protein levels of Beclin I and LC3-II/(LC3-I + LC3-II) in brain tissues (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4, B and C). Compared with the control group, the OGD model group showed an increase in protein levels of Beclin I and LC3-II/(LC3-I + LC3-II) (p < 0.05). Based on the data of in vitro experiments, when compared with the OGD model group at the 24th h, the miR-378 inhibitor OGD group revealed increased protein levels of Beclin I and LC3-II/(LC3-I + LC3-II) (p < 0.05), whereas the miR-378 mimic OGD, GRB2 siRNA OGD, and miR-378 inhibitor + GRB2 siRNA OGD groups showed reduced protein levels of Beclin I and LC3-II/(LC3-I + LC3-II) (p < 0.05). The levels of autophagy-associated protein in the miR-378 inhibitor + GRB2 siRNA OGD group was significantly different from that in the miR-378 inhibitor and GRB2 siRNA OGD groups (p < 0. 05) (Fig. 4D). These findings showed that miR-378 knockdown increased neuronal autophagy in ischemic stroke, whereas miR-378 overexpression and GRB2 knockdown reduced neuronal autophagy. The protein levels of GRB2, Beclin, LC3-I, and LC3-II and the extents of Akt, mTOR, and S6 phosphorylation in the brain tissues from mice were determined by Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A, the MCAO group exhibited increases in the protein level of Beclin and LC3-II/(LC3-I + LC3-II) ratio compared with the sham group (p < 0.05). Compared with the MCAO group, the protein level of Beclin and LC3-II/(LC3-I + LC3-II) ratio were much higher in the miR-378+/− MCAO group. However, the protein level of Beclin and LC3-II/(LC3-I + LC3-II) ratio were decreased in the miR-378 mimic MCAO and GRB2+/−MCAO groups relative to the MCAO group (p < 0.05), which was consistent with the results of obtained from experiments on primary neurons. The MCAO group showed an increase in the protein level of GRB2 and a decrease in the extents of Akt, mTOR and S6 phosphorylation (p < 0.05). Compared with the MCAO model mice, the protein level of GRB2 was elevated, but the extents of Akt, mTOR, and S6 phosphorylation were reduced in the miR-378+/− MCAO mice (p < 0.05). The miR-378 mimic MCAO and GRB2+/− MCAO groups showed a reduction in the protein level of GRB2 and increases in the extents of Akt, mTOR, and S6 phosphorylation in contrast to the miR-378+/− MCAO group (p < 0.05). In addition, the extents of Akt and S6 phosphorylation in the brain tissues from mice were detected using immunohistochemical staining. The results revealed changes in the extents of Akt and S6 phosphorylation consistent with those determined by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 5B). Next, the protein levels of GRB2, Beclin, LC3-I, and LC3-II, and the extent of Akt, mTOR, and S6 phosphorylation were determined in the in vitro setting. Compared with the control group, the protein level of Beclin and the LC3-II/(LC3-I + LC3-II) ratio were increased in the OGD group (p < 0.05). Compared with the OGD group, the protein levels of Beclin and LC3-II/(LC3-I + LC3-II) ratio were much higher in the miR-378 inhibitor OGD group, whereas those levels were decreased in the miR-378 mimic OGD, GRB2 siRNA OGD, and miR-378 inhibitor + GRB2 siRNA OGD groups (p < 0.05). In addition, the expression of those autophagy-related proteins demonstrated significant difference in the miR-378 inhibitor + GRB2 siRNA OGD group compared with the miR-378 inhibitor OGD and GRB2 siRNA OGD groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the Beclin protein level and LC3-II/(LC3-I + LC3-II) ratio were lowered in the miR-378 mimic + GRB2 siRNA OGD group relative to the miR-378 inhibitor + GRB2 siRNA OGD group. Compared with the control group, the OGD model group showed elevated protein levels of GRB2 and reduced extents of Akt, mTOR, and S6 phosphorylation (p < 0.05). The miR-378 inhibitor OGD group revealed elevated protein levels of GRB2 and reduced the extent of Akt, mTOR, and S6 phosphorylation, whereas the miR-378 mimic OGD, GRB2 siRNA OGD, miR-378 inhibitor + GRB2 siRNA OGD, and miR-378 mimic + GRB2 siRNA OGD groups showed reduced protein levels of GRB2 and increased extent of Akt, mTOR, and S6 phosphorylation versus the OGD model group (p < 0.05). No significant difference was witnessed in those levels between the GRB2 siRNA OGD and miR-378 mimic + GRB2 siRNA OGD groups (Fig. 5C). Combining the results of the MCAO and OGD models, we found that silencing of miR-378 promoted the autophagy level of in brain tissues, whereas either miR-378 overexpression or GRB2 silencing slowed down the autophagy level. Furthermore, miR-378 knockdown decreased, whereas miR-378 overexpression and GRB2 knockdown enhanced Akt, mTOR, and S6 phosphorylation, suggesting that miR-378 knockdown might disrupt the activation of AKT/mTOR pathway by targeting GRB2. It has been reported that MEG3 is expressed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (21Tan M.C. Widagdo J. Chau Y.Q. Zhu T. Wong J.J. Cheung A. Anggono V.

As shown in Fig. 6A, MEG3 was up-regulated in the MCAO-operated mice compared with the sham-operated mice (p < 0.05). Consistently, MEG3 was up-regulated in OGD-exposed neurons compared with the control neurons (p < 0.05). Based on the lncRNA–miRNA interaction prediction by the RNA22 database (RRID:SCR_016507), MEG3 had a binding interaction with miR-378. The predicted binding site of MEG3 and miR-378 is shown in Fig. 6B. The results of Dual-Luciferase reporter assay showed no significant differences in the luciferase activity of miR-378–Mut–plasmid between the NC and lncRNA MEG3-cDNA groups (p > 0.05). The luciferase activity of the miR-378–WT–plasmid was significantly lower in the lncRNA MEG3-cDNA group than in the NC group (p < 0.05). Therefore, MEG3 had a binding relation with miR-378. RT-qPCR was conducted to determine the expression of miR-378 in the OGD model group after neurons were transfected with MEG3 siRNA and pcDNA-MEG3. Compared with the blank and NC groups, the lncRNA MEG3 siRNA group showed a decline in the MEG3 expression and an increase in the miR-378 expression, but pcDNA-MEG3 indicated an increase in the MEG3 expression and a decrease in the miR-378 expression (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6C).

https://openalex.org/W3040626209,"Introduction Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are often under-recognized in the community. MCI/ADRD screening could offer benefits such as early treatment, research participation, lifestyle modification, and advanced care planning. To date, there are no clear guidelines regarding the benefits vs. harms of dementia screening or whether a dementia screening program could be successful. Methods A community-based study was conducted to evaluate an MCI/ADRD screening program and determine what older adults would do with the information. Measures of cognition, physical health, functionality, and mood were collected. Participants met with a health professional, were given screening results with recommendations, and then contacted 60 days later to determine what was done with the results. Logistic regression models were used to build predictive models. Results Participants (n = 288) had a mean age of 71.5±8.3y, mean education of 13.3±4.8y, and were 70% female, 67% White, 26% African American, and 48% Hispanic. After 60 days, 75% of participants were re-contacted; 54% shared results with family, 33% shared results with health care providers (HCPs), and 52% initiated behavioral change. Among participants sharing results with HCPs, 51% reported HCPs did not follow-up on the results, and 18% that HCPs did not show any interest in the screening visit or its results. Predictors of sharing results with HCPs were elevated hemoglobin A1C (OR = 1.85;95%CI:1.19–2.88), uncontrolled hypertension (OR = 2.73;95%CI:1.09–6.83), and mobility issues (OR = 2.43;95%CI: 1.93–5.54). Participant behavioral changes included lifestyle modification (58%), social engagement (10%), cognitive stimulation (5%), and advanced care planning (4%). The most significant predictors of sharing with family were better overall mental health (OR = 0.19; 95%CI: 0.06–0.59) and better physical function (OR = 0.38; 95%CI: 0.17–0.81). Discussion MCI/ADRD screening was well-received by a diverse community sample. Participants showed interest in sharing the results with their family and HCPs and many attempted behavioral change. While HCPs did not always act on screening results, 25% ordered further testing and evaluation. Efforts need to be directed toward (1) increasing self-efficacy of older adults to discuss screening results with their HCPs, and (2) educating HCPs on the value of early detection of MCI/ADRD. Community dementia screening programs can increase MCI/ADRD detection and improve patient-centered outcomes and medical decision-making."

The study also examined whether malnutrition was associated with the presence of enamel defects in 0-5-year-old children.The study was a secondary analysis of primary data of a cross-sectional study assessing the association between maternal psychosocial health and ECC in sub-urban Nigerian population collected in December 2018 and January 2019. One hundred and fifty nine children were recruited. Exploratory variables were malnutrition and enamel defects. The outcome variables were the prevalence of ECC in 0-2-year-old, 3-5-year-old, and 0-5-year-old children. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis was used to determine the associations, and socioeconomic status, oral hygiene status, and frequency of in-between-meals sugar consumption were adjusted for. The adjusted prevalence ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p values were calculated.The prevalence of ECC was 2.1% in 0-2-year-old children and 4.9% in 3-5-year-old children. In adjusted models, underweight, stunting, and wasting/overweight were not significant risk indicators for ECC in either age group. 0-2-year-old children who had amelogenesis imperfecta (p<0.001) and fluorosis (p<0.001) were more likely to have ECC than were children who did not have these lesions. 3-5-year-old children who had hypoplasia (p = 0.004), amelogenesis imperfecta (p<0.001) and fluorosis (p<0.001) were more likely to have ECC than were children who did not have these lesions. 0-5-year-old children with hypoplasia (p<0.001) and fluorosis (p<0.001) were more likely to have ECC than were children who did not have these lesions. There were significant associations between various types of malnutrition and various types of enamel defects.Although different types of malnutrition were associated with enamel defects, and enamel defects were associated with ECC, malnutrition was not associated with ECC. Further studies are needed to clarify the association between malnutrition and genetically and toxin-induced enamel defects."
https://openalex.org/W3040337024,"Testosterone regulates dimorphic sexual behaviors in all vertebrates. However, the molecular mechanism underlying these behaviors remains unclear. Here, we report that a newly identified rapid testosterone signaling receptor, Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 8 (TRPM8), regulates dimorphic sexual and social behaviors in mice. We found that, along with higher steroid levels in the circulation, TRPM8−/− male mice exhibit increased mounting frequency indiscriminate of sex, delayed sexual satiety, and increased aggression compared to wild-type controls, while TRPM8−/− females display an increased olfaction-exploratory behavior. Furthermore, neuronal responses to acute testosterone application onto the amygdala were attenuated in TRPM8−/− males but remained unchanged in females. Moreover, activation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area following mating was impaired in TRPM8−/− males. Together, these results demonstrate that TRPM8 regulates dimorphic sexual and social behaviors, and potentially constitutes a signalosome for mediation of sex-reward mechanism in males. Thus, deficiency of TRPM8 might lead to a delayed sexual satiety phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W3038216231,"The plasticity of different kelp populations to heat stress has seldom been investigated excluding environmental effects due to thermal histories, by raising a generation under common garden conditions. Comparisons of populations in the absence of environmental effects allow unbiased quantification of the meta-population adaptive potential and resolution of population-specific differentiation. Following this approach, we tested the hypothesis that genetically distinct arctic and temperate kelp exhibit different thermal phenotypes, by comparing the capacity of their microscopic life stages to recover from elevated temperatures. Gametophytes of Laminaria digitata (Arctic and North Sea) grown at 15°C for 3 years were subjected to common garden conditions with static or dynamic (i.e., gradual) thermal treatments ranging between 15 and 25°C and also to darkness. Gametophyte growth and survival during thermal stress conditions, and subsequent sporophyte recruitment at two recovery temperatures (5 and 15°C), were investigated. Population-specific responses were apparent; North Sea gametophytes exhibited higher growth rates and greater sporophyte recruitment than those from the Arctic when recovering from high temperatures, revealing differential thermal adaptation. All gametophytes performed poorly after recovery from a static 8-day exposure at 22.5°C compared to the response under a dynamic thermal treatment with a peak temperature of 25°C, demonstrating the importance of gradual warming and/or acclimation time in modifying thermal limits. Recovery temperature markedly affected the capacity of gametophytes to reproduce following high temperatures, regardless of the population. Recovery at 5°C resulted in higher sporophyte production following a 15°C and 20°C static exposure, whereas recovery at 15°C was better for gametophyte exposures to static 22.5°C or dynamic heat stress to 25°C. The subtle performance differences between populations originating from sites with contrasting local in situ temperatures support our hypothesis that their thermal plasticity has diverged over evolutionary time scales."
https://openalex.org/W3040564486,"Background Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the most common respiratory disease in premature babies and the major cause of morbidity and mortality among preterm babies. Effective treatment of these babies requires exogenous surfactant and/or mechanical ventilation but these are of limited availability in low and middle income countries. A cheaper, simpler and more accessible treatment for preterms with RDS called bubble-continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) has been reported to be effective in treating RDS in preterm babies with varying levels of effectiveness ranging from 42% to 85%. We aimed to implement and determine the efficacy of bCPAP and its immediate outcomes as compared to oxygen therapy in preterm babies presenting with respiratory distress at a tertiary hospital in Tanzania. Method A randomized control trial, conducted from December 2016 to May 2017, included all preterm babies admitted at the neonatal care unit presenting with signs of respiratory distress and meeting the inclusion criteria. The primary outcome was survival while the secondary outcomes were treatment duration, duration of hospital stay and treatment complications. Results A total of 824 babies were admitted in the neonatal care unit during the study period. Of these, 187 babies were preterm and 48 babies were recruited and randomized (25 bCPAP vs 23 oxygen). The overall survival to discharge for all eligible participants (n = 48) was 58.2% compared to those who adhered to treatment protocol (n = 45, 62.2%). Babies in the bCPAP group had higher survival (17/22; 77.3%) as compared to their counterparts in the oxygen therapy group (11/23; 47.8%). Babies treated with bCPAP had 52% lower risk of death (crude HR 0.48, 95% CI = 0.16–1.43) compared to babies receiving oxygen therapy. The median duration of treatment for babies in the oxygen therapy group was 2 (Range 0–16) days compared to 2 (Range 0–5) days in the bCPAP group. The median duration of hospital stay for babies receiving bCPAP was 14 (range 7–43) days. Nasal bleeding was commonly observed among babies in the bCPAP group as compared to those in the oxygen therapy group. Conclusion This study revealed that treatment with bCPAP had a 30% clinical improvement in survival to discharge. Our findings highlight the role of bCPAP in reducing neonatal mortality in resource limited settings but further adequately powered studies in this or similar settings are required."
https://openalex.org/W3040363247,"The objective is to improve the prediction accuracy of foundation pit deformation in geotechnical engineering, thereby provide early warning for engineering practice. The digital close-range photogrammetry is used to obtain monitoring data. The error compensation method is used to optimize the center of the monitoring point. Aiming at the limitations of back propagation neural network (BPNN), a genetic algorithm (GA)-optimized BPNN algorithm is proposed. Then, the optimized algorithm is applied to predict the deformation and displacement of foundation pits from three aspects, i.e., simple horizontal displacement, simple longitudinal displacement, and the combination of horizontal and longitudinal displacements. Meanwhile, the time domain, space domain, and time-space domain are used as input features to compare the prediction results of the BPNN model and the GA-optimized BPNN model. Finally, the GA-improved BPNN is compared with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model and Random Forest (RF) model. The results show that the prediction result, obtained by simultaneously using horizontal displacement and longitudinal displacement as input features, has smaller errors; also, the actual output is closer to the expected output. Compared with the prediction result with time domain and space domain as input features, the prediction result with time-space domain as input features is closer to the expected output. Taking the combination of time and space domains as input features, compared with the BPNN model, the GA-optimized BPNN model has a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value (0.0163), a larger Index of Agreement (IA) value (0.9800), and a shorter training time (7.08 s). Compared with the SVR model and RF model, the GA-improved BPNN model has a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value (0.0211), a larger Index of Agreement (IA) value (0.9706), and shorter training time (7.61 s). Therefore, the foundation pit deformation prediction model based on BPNN and GA has strong prediction ability, which can be popularized and applied in similar geotechnical engineering."

This research work presents a comparative analysis of different adaptive Feedback Linearization (FBL) embedded Full Recurrent Adaptive NeuroFuzzy (FRANF) control schemes for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of PV subsystem tied to a smart microgrid hybrid power system (SMG-HPS). The proposed schemes are differentiated based on structure and mathematical functions used in FRANF embedded in the FBL model. The comparative analysis is carried out based on efficiency and performance indexes obtained using the power error between the reference and the tracked power for three cases; a) step change in solar irradiation and temperature, b) partial shading condition (PSC), and c) daily field data. The proposed schemes offer enhanced convergence compared to existing techniques in terms of complexity and stability. The overall performance of all the proposed schemes is evaluated by a spider chart of multivariate comparable parameters. Adaptive PID is used for the comparison of results produced by proposed control schemes. The performance of Mexican hat wavelet-based FRANF embedded FBL is superior to the other proposed schemes as well as to aPID based MPPT scheme. However, all proposed schemes produce better results as compared to conventional MPPT control in all cases. Matlab/Simulink is used to carry out the simulations."
https://openalex.org/W3038482699,"Cannabinoids exert therapeutic effects on several diseases such as chronic pain and startle disease by targeting glycine receptors (GlyRs). Our previous studies have shown that cannabinoids target a serine residue at position 296 in the third transmembrane helix of the α1/α3 GlyR. This site is located on the outside of the ion channel protein at the lipid interface where the cholesterol concentrates. However, whether membrane cholesterol regulates cannabinoid-GlyR interaction remains unknown. Here, we show that GlyRs are closely associated with cholesterol/caveolin-rich domains at subcellular levels. Membrane cholesterol reduction significantly inhibits cannabinoid potentiation of glycine-activated currents in cultured spinal neurons and in HEK 293T cells expressing α1/α3 GlyRs. Such inhibition is fully rescued by cholesterol replenishment in a concentration-dependent manner. Molecular docking calculations further reveal that cholesterol regulates cannabinoid enhancement of GlyR function through both direct and indirect mechanisms. Taken together, these findings suggest that cholesterol is critical for the cannabinoid-GlyR interaction in the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W3039765952,"The association between mention of scientific research in popular media (e.g., the mainstream media or social media platforms) and scientific impact (e.g., citations) has yet to be fully explored. The purpose of this study was to clarify this relationship, while accounting for some other factors that likely influence scientific impact (e.g., the reputations of the scientists conducting the research and academic journal in which the research was published). To accomplish this purpose, approximately 800 peer-reviewed articles describing original research were evaluated for scientific impact, popular media attention, and reputations of the scientists/authors and publication venue. A structural equation model was produced describing the relationship between non-scientific impact (popular media) and scientific impact (citations), while accounting for author/scientist and journal reputation. The resulting model revealed a strong association between the amount of popular media attention given to a scientific research project and corresponding publication and the number of times that publication is cited in peer-reviewed scientific literature. These results indicate that (1) peer-reviewed scientific publications receiving more attention in non-scientific media are more likely to be cited than scientific publications receiving less popular media attention, and (2) the non-scientific media is associated with the scientific agenda. These results may inform scientists who increasingly use popular media to inform the general public and scientists concerning their scientific work. These results might also inform administrators of higher education and research funding mechanisms, who base decisions partly on scientific impact."
https://openalex.org/W3040408912,"Background Although respiratory distress is one of the major causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality throughout the globe, it is a particularly serious concern for nations like Ethiopia that have significant resource limitations. Additionally, few studies have looked at neonatal respiratory distress and its predictors in developing countries, and thus we sought to investigate this issue in neonates who were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted with 571 neonates from January 2013 to March 2018. Data were collected by reviewing patients’ charts using a systematic sampling technique with a pretested checklist. The data was then entered using Epi-data 4.2 and analyzed with STATA 14. Median time, Kaplan-Meier survival estimation curves, and log-rank tests were then computed. Bivariable and multivariable Gompertz parametric hazard models were fitted to detect the determinants of respiratory distress. The hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval was subsequently calculated. Variables with reported p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results The proportion of neonates with respiratory distress among those admitted to the Black Lion Specialized Hospital neonatal intensive care unit was 42.9% (95%CI: 39.3–46.1%) The incidence rate was 8.1/100 (95%CI: 7.3, 8.9). Significant predictors of respiratory distress in neonates included being male [Adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 2.4 (95%CI: 1.1, 3.1)], born via caesarean section [AHR: 1.9 (95%CI: 1.6, 2.3)], home delivery [AHR: 2.9 (95%CI: 1.5, 5,2)], maternal diabetes mellitus (AHR: 2.3 (95%CI: 1.4, 3.6)), preterm birth [AHR: 2.9 (95%CI: 1.6, 5.1)], and having an Apgar score of less than 7 [AHR: 3.1 (95%CI: 1.8, 5.0)]. Conclusions In this study, the proportion of respiratory distress (RD) was high. Preterm birth, delivery by caesarean section, Apgar score < 7, sepsis, maternal diabetes mellitus, and home delivery were all significant predictors of this condition. Based on our findings this would likely include encouraging more hospital births, better control of diabetes in pregnancy, improved neonatal resuscitation and addressing ways to decrease the need for frequent caesarean sections."

However, the interactions between these plastic particles and marine microorganisms are just starting to be understood. The objective of this study was to measure the responses of a characteristic marine organism (Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002) to an anthropogenic stressor (polyethelene nanoparticles and microparticles) using molecular techniques. This investigation showed that polyethylene microparticles and nanoparticles have genetic, enzymatic and morphological effects on Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. An RT-PCR analysis showed increases in the expression of esterase and hydrolase genes at 5 days of exposure to polyethylene nanoparticles and at 10 days of exposure to polyethylene microparticles. A qualitative enzymatic assay also showed esterase activity in nanoparticle exposed samples. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy was used to assess morphological changes in exopolymer formation resulting from exposure to polyethylene microparticles and nanoparticles. The data from this paper suggests that microplastic and nanoplastics could be key microbial stressors and should be investigated in further detail."
https://openalex.org/W3039735472,"Genital psoriasis affects 2–5% of psoriasis patients; generalised plaque or intertriginous psoriasis also affects the genital area in 29–40% of cases. Anogenital psoriasis has been associated with significant quality of life impairments, but little is known about specific patient needs/treatment goals. This study aimed to examine the overall and sex-related disease burden, patient needs and treatment benefits in patients with anogenital psoriasis, compared to patients with psoriasis not affecting the anal/genital areas. Within the cross-sectional nationwide survey, 2,009 participants were consecutively recruited in 157 randomly assigned German dermatology practices and clinics, according to the following inclusion criteria aged 18 years or over; diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris; ability to answer the questionnaires; and written informed consent. Based on a high-resolution grid on the topical distribution of psoriasis, two groups were formed: anogenital psoriasis (n = 622) and comparison group (n = 1,303). Clinical severity was assessed by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Patients completed the EuroQoL visual analogue scale (EQ VAS), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and the Patient Benefit Index (PBI). Patients with anogenital psoriasis had higher PASI (13.0±10.6 vs. 8.9±7.6, P < 0.001) and more DLQI impairments (8.9±6.9 vs. 7.0±6.2, P = 0.002) than controls. At the item-level, they also reported more sex-related DLQI impairments (DLQI-i9: 0.5±0.8 vs. 0.3±0.7, P < 0.001) and treatment needs (PBI-i17: 2.2±1.8 vs. 1.9±1.8, P = 0.001). A great percentage of missing/not-relevant responses was found for sex-related items (23.3–41.9%). These results suggest that the assessment of sex-related impairments and treatment needs should be prioritised in patients with anogenital psoriasis. Questionnaires may be used as a less uncomfortable way for patients to discuss their genital lesions and sexual function during healthcare visits. However, the great percentage of missing/not-relevant responses to sex-related items calls for in-depth assessments and effective patient-physician communication regarding these sensitive topics."
https://openalex.org/W3039928036,"Diabetes mellitus is a well-known risk factor for pancreatic cancer. We focused on hyperglycemia, a main feature of diabetes mellitus, and uncovered its effect on precancerous pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) progression. In vivo induction of hyperglycemia with 100 mg/kg streptozotocin in KrasLSL G12D Pdx1Cre (KP) mice promoted the PanIN formation and progression. Preconditioning with a high- or low-glucose medium for 28 days showed that a high-glucose environment increased cell viability and sphere formation in PANC-1, a Kras-mutant human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line, and mPKC1, a Kras-mutant murine pancreatic cancer cell line. In contrast, no changes were observed in BxPC3, a Kras-wild-type human pancreatic cancer cell line. Orthotopic injection of mPKC1 into the pancreatic tails of BL6/J mice showed that cells maintained in high-glucose medium grew into larger tumors than did those maintained in low-glucose medium. Hyperglycemia strengthened the STAT3 phosphorylation, which was accompanied by elevated MYC expression in Kras-mutant cells. Immunohistochemistry showed stronger phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and MYC staining in PanINs from diabetic KP mice than in those from euglycemic counterparts. STAT3 inhibition with 1 μM STAT3 inhibitor STATTIC in Kras-mutant pancreatic cell lines blocked the cell viability- and sphere formation-enhancing effects of the hyperglycemic environment and reversed the elevated pSTAT3 and MYC expression. MYC knockdown did not affect cell viability but did reduce sphere formation. No decrease in pSTAT3 expression was observed upon siMYC treatment. In conclusion, hyperglycemia, on a Kras-mutant background, aggravates the PanIN progression, which is accompanied by elevated pSTAT3 and MYC expression."
https://openalex.org/W3040221740,"Seafloor mapping to create bathymetric charts of the oceans is important for various applications. However, making high-resolution bathymetric charts requires measuring underwater depths at many points in sea areas, and thus, is time-consuming and costly. In this work, treating gridded bathymetric data as digital images, we employ the image-processing technique known as superresolution to enhance the resolution of bathymetric charts by estimating high-resolution images from low-resolution ones. Specifically, we use the recently-developed deep-learning methodology to automatically learn the geometric features of ocean floors and recover their details. Through an experiment using bathymetric data around Japan, we confirmed that the proposed method outperforms naive interpolation both qualitatively and quantitatively, observing an eight-dB average improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio. Deep-learning-based bathymetric image superresolution can significantly reduce the number of sea areas or points that must be measured, thereby accelerating the detailed mapping of the seafloor and the creation of high-resolution bathymetric charts around the globe."
https://openalex.org/W3038204257,"Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) inhibits the activity of thioredoxin (TXN), leading to increased oxidative stress. Expression of the TXNIP gene is regulated by DNA methylation. However, no study has reported the influence of lifestyle factors on TXNIP DNA methylation. Our goal was to determine the association between smoking habits and TXNIP DNA methylation levels in a Japanese population. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 417 subjects (180 males and 237 females) participating in a health examination. We used a pyrosequencing assay to determine TXNIP DNA methylation levels in leukocytes. The mean TXNIP DNA methylation level in current smokers (75.3%) was significantly lower than that in never and ex-smokers (never: 78.1%, p < 0.001; ex: 76.9%, p = 0.013). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that the OR for TXNIP DNA hypomethylation was significantly higher in current smokers than that in never smokers, and significantly higher in current smokers with years of smoking ≥ 35 and Brinkman Index ≥ 600 compared to that in non-smokers. In conclusion, we found that current smokers had TXNIP DNA hypomethylation compared to never and ex-smokers. Moreover, long-term smoking and high smoking exposure also were associated with TXNIP DNA hypomethylation."
https://openalex.org/W3040322556,"The herb dwarf lilyturf tuber (Maidong, Ophiopogonis Radix) is widely used in Chinese traditional medicine to manage diabetes and its complications. However, the role of Maidong polysaccharide extract (MPE) in pancreatic β-cell function is unclear. Here, we investigated whether MPE protects β-cell function and studied the underlying mechanisms. We treated db/db and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice with 800 or 400 mg/kg MPE or water for 4 weeks, followed by an oral glucose tolerance test. Pancreas and blood were collected for molecular analyses, and clonal MIN6 β-cells and primary islets from HFD-induced obese mice and normal chow diet-fed mice were used in additional analyses. In vivo, MPE both increased insulin secretion and reduced blood glucose in the db/db mice but increased only insulin secretion in the HFD-induced obese mice. MPE substantially increased the β-cell area in both models (3-fold and 2-fold, p < 0.01, for db/db and HFD mice, respectively). We observed reduced nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB in islets of MPE-treated db/db mice, coinciding with enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). In vitro, MPE potentiated GSIS and decreased interleukin 1β (IL-1β) secretion in MIN6 β-cells. Incubation of MIN6 cells with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interferon-γ, and IL-1β amplified IL-1β secretion and inhibited GSIS. These effects were partially reversed with MPE or the IκB kinase β inhibitor PS1145, coinciding with reduced activation of p65 and p-IκB in the NF-κB pathway. We conclude that MPE may have potential for therapeutic development for β-cell protection."

Talin recruitment to the membrane is necessary for its binding to and activation of integrin. Vertebrates have two highly conserved talin homologs that differ in their expression patterns. The F1–F3 FERM subdomains of cytoskeletal proteins resemble a cloverleaf, but in talin1, its F1 subdomain and additional F0 subdomain align more linearly with its F2 and F3 subdomains. Here, we present the talin2 crystal structure, revealing that its F0-F1 di-subdomain displays another unprecedented constellation, whereby the F0-F1-F2 adopts a new cloverleaf-like arrangement. Using multiangle light scattering (MALS), fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), and FRET analyses, we found that substituting the corresponding residues in talin2 that abolish lipid binding in talin1 disrupt the binding of talin to the membrane, focal adhesion formation, and cell spreading.

Thus, talin1 and talin2 seemed at first glance to be functionally redundant. However, the two isoforms transduce mechanical force differently. Under tension, talin1 recruits vinculin, but with talin2, vinculin recruitment occurs even in the absence of its F-actin–binding domain (45Austen K. Ringer P. Mehlich A. Chrostek-Grashoff A.

Further, cardiac myocyte talin2 is necessary for proper integrin β1D expression, whereas talin1 can preserve heart function in the absence of talin2. Loss of both talin isoforms from the heart muscle results in myocyte instability and dilated cardiomyopathy (46Manso A.M. Okada H. Sakamoto F.M. Moreno E. Monkley S.J. Li R. Critchley D.R. Ross R.S.

A recent talin2-null study on T-cell exosomes showed reduced binding of integrins αLβ2 and α4β7 to the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and to the mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) (48Soe Z.Y.

Collectively, the talin isoforms do not compensate for the loss of the other, and their functions are distinct. To determine the molecular basis for the difference between the talin isoform functions, we solved the crystal structure of the talin2 head domain (residues 1–403) to 2.56 Å resolution and provide structural and functional insights into the talin isoforms. Despite their ∼76% sequence identity and ∼88% sequence similarity for mammalian isoforms, in talin2, whereas the F0-F1 and F2-F3 domains resemble those seen in talin1, F1 engages in distinct interdomain interactions with F2 to result in a completely distinct head domain constellation that has not been observed for any other FERM domain–containing protein. Our solution studies obtained from size-exclusion chromatography support these findings. Despite their distinct head domain constellation, the mammalian talin isoforms share the same membrane-binding sites. Both full-length proteins are monomeric as determined by multiangle light scattering. This previously disputed observation is now also confirmed by the cryo-EM structure (49Dedden D. Schumacher S.

Our confocal microscopy and in vivo fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) with FRET analyses revealed the functional relevance of the talin interaction with the cell membrane. Collectively, we provide significant new insights into talin structure and function that pave the way toward a better understanding of the regulation of integrin function and of fundamental processes in cell biology including the cytoskeletal organization. To provide structural insights into the functional differences between the two talin isoforms, we determined the crystal structure of human talin2 (residues 1–403) to 2.56 Å resolution (Table 1, Table 2). Whereas the individual talin2 di-subdomains F0-F1 and F2-F3 are almost identical as seen in the talin1 structure, the F0-F1 motif is rotated by ∼140° in talin2 relative to its orientation in talin1 (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). This is accomplished by isoform-specific F1-F2 interdomain interactions.Table 1X-ray data reduction statistics for our human talin2 structure (residues 1–403)ParametersValuesSpace groupP 65Unit cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)58.89, 58.89, 203.8α, β, γ (degrees)90, 90, 120Resolution (Å)101.9–2.56 (2.60–2.56)Total measurements13,1041 (11,611)No. of unique reflections12,969 (631)Wavelength1.0 ÅRpimaRpim is the precision-indicating merging R-factor given as Rpim=∑hkl1n−1∑i|Ihkl,i−Ihkl|∑hkl∑iIhkl,i.0.044 (0.381)Signal/noise I/σ(I)15.7 (2.7)Completeness1.0 (1.0)Multiplicity10.1 (5.7)CC½bCC½ is a Pearson's correlation coefficient calculated between the average intensities of each random half of measurements of unique reflections.0.998 (0.734)a Rpim is the precision-indicating merging R-factor given as Rpim=∑hkl1n−1∑i|Ihkl,i−Ihkl|∑hkl∑iIhkl,i.b CC½ is a Pearson's correlation coefficient calculated between the average intensities of each random half of measurements of unique reflections.

https://openalex.org/W3038433435,"Informal waste recyclers contribute significantly to waste removal in South Africa. Waste recyclers face health hazards which are associated with handling and disposal of waste, a lack of personal protective wear and inaccessibility to occupational health care services. Consequently, accessing health care within the public health care sector is important for health outcomes in this population. This study assesses health care access of informal waste recyclers in South Africa to establish baseline information for health planning for potential inclusion of informal waste recyclers into occupational health services.A cross-sectional study of informal waste recyclers in two landfill sites in Johannesburg was conducted from March 2018. A standardized structured questionnaire was used to collect information on sociodemographic details, health care utilization, barriers to access and acceptability and affordability of health care. Factors associated with health care utilization were assessed using logistic regression.A total of 363 informal waste recyclers were included in the study. Less than half of informal waste recyclers (41.0%) used health care facilities in the last 12 months. Those who accessed services chose to use facilities close to where they live (87.0%). Barriers to accessing health care services included long waiting periods (36.6%), being unable to take time off work (26.3%) and transport problems (13%). In the univariate analysis, factors such as gender and being treated well at the clinic and location of the health care facility were associated with health care utilization (OR: 1.97, p = 0.05, OR: 1.94, p = 0.02, OR: 0.65, p = 0.04 respectively).Informal waste recyclers face numerous challenges to accessing health care. Specific to their informal trade, barriers to health care utilization are related to financial repercussions due to the informal nature of their work."
https://openalex.org/W3039153256,"Introduction The Electronic Health Record (EHR) has become an integral component of healthcare delivery. Survey based studies have estimated that physicians spend 4–6 hours of their workday devoted to EHR. Our study was designed to use computer software to objectively obtain time spent on EHR. Methods We recorded EHR time for 248 physiciansover 2 time intervals. EHR active use was defined as more than 15 keystrokes, or 3 clicks, or 1700 mouse miles per minute. We recorded total time and % of work hours spent on EHR, and differences in those based on seniority. Physicians reported duty hours using a standardized toolkit. Results Physicians spent 3.8 (±2) hours on EHR daily, which accounted for 37% (±17%), 41% (±14%), and 45% (±12%) of their day for all clinicians, residents, and interns, respectively. With the progression of training, there was a reduction in EHR time (all p values <0.01). During the first academic quarter, clinicians spent 38% (± 8%) of time on chart review, 17% (± 7%) on orders, 28% (±11%) on documentation (i.e. writing notes) and 17% (±7%) on other activities (i.e. physician hand-off and medication reconciliation). This pattern remained unchanged during the fourth quarter. Conclusions Physicians spend close to 40% of their work day on EHR, with interns spending the most time. There is a significant reduction in time spent on EHR with training and greater experience, although the overall amount of time spent on EHR remained high."

Exposure sources and demographic factors vary by location and can therefore have a major impact on salmonellosis clustering. We evaluated major NTS serotypes: S. Enteritidis (n = 620), S. Typhimurium (n = 150), S. Thompson (n = 138), and S. Heidelberg (n = 136) reported in the city of Toronto, Canada, between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017. Cases were analyzed at the forward sortation area (FSA)—level (an area indicated by the first three characters of the postal code). Serotype-specific global and local clustering of infections were evaluated using the Moran's I method. Spatial and space-time clusters were investigated using Poisson and multinomial scan statistic models. Case-case analyses using a multinomial logistic regression model was conducted to compare seasonal and demographic factors among the different serotypes. High infection rate FSAs clustered in the central region of Toronto for S. Enteritidis, in the south-central region for S. Typhimurium, in north-west region for S. Thompson, and in the south-east region for S. Heidelberg. The relative risk ratio of S. Enteritidis infections was significantly higher in cases who reported travel outside of Ontario. The relative risk ratio of infections was significantly higher in summer for S. Typhimurium, and in fall for S. Thompson. The relative risk ratio of infection was highest for the 0–9 age group for S. Typhimurium, and the 20–39 age group for S. Heidelberg. Our study will aid public health stakeholders in designing serotype-specific geographically targeted disease prevention programs."

The technique was applied to amyloid tissues collected by laser microdissection of Congo red-stained lesions of FFPE specimens. Twelve of 13 amyloid precursor proteins were successfully quantified, including serum amyloid A (SAA), transthyretin (TTR), immunoglobulin kappa light chain (IGK), immunoglobulin lambda light chain (IGL), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), apolipoprotein (Apo) A1, Apo A4, Apo E, lysozyme, Apo A2, gelsolin, and fibrinogen alpha chain; leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2 was not detected. The quantification of SAA, TTR, IGK, IGL, and B2M confirmed the responsible proteins, even when the immunohistochemical results were not decisive. Considerable amounts of Apo A1, Apo A4, and Apo E were deposited in parallel amounts with the responsible proteins. Quantification of amyloid protein by MS-QBIC is feasible and useful for the classification of and research on systemic amyloidoses."

The direct age-standardized rate, with 95% confidence interval (CI), was used to compare EI rates for the four calendar years. The chi-square test and chi-square test for trend were used to compare data for the four calendar years.Annual EI incidence rates were between 2.57% in 2000 and 3.28% in 2015. The age-standardized rates were 2.73% (95% CI, 2.70%-2.76%) in 2000, 3.37% (95% CI, 3.33%-3.41%) in 2005, 3.31% (95% CI, 3.28%-3.35%) in 2010, and 3.02% (95% CI, 2.99%-3.06%) in 2015. Manual workers had the highest EI incidence rate, followed by non-manual workers and civil servants. The proportion of EI requiring inpatient treatment declined from 1.34% in 2000 to 0.63% in 2015 (P <0.0001). Analysis of seasonality showed a consistent decrease in February in the four sampling years; however, this decrease in EI was only seen in outpatients, not in EI requiring hospitalization. The proportion of outpatients requiring surgery significantly decreased, from 2.53% in 2000 to 1.2% in 2015 (P<0.0001). However, the proportion of inpatients requiring surgery for EI as the principal diagnosis increased from 69.32% in 2000 to 83.02% in 2015 (P = 0.29), and the proportion of inpatients requiring surgery for EI as a secondary diagnosis increased from 54.86% in 2000 to 71.6% in 2015 (P = 0.0019). Among inpatients with EI, the most common cause of EI was a traffic accident (44.79%, especially motorcycles), followed by falls (9.75%) and homicide (6.05%).In Taiwan, the annual EI incidence rate slightly increased from 2000 to 2005 and then decreased through 2015. The proportion of EI patients requiring hospitalization decreased from 1.34% in 2000 to 0.63% in 2015, but the percentage of inpatients requiring surgery increased. Traffic accidents (especially those involving motorcyclists) remained the predominant external cause of EI requiring hospitalization during the study period."
https://openalex.org/W3038366404,"Elucidating the diets of insect predators is important in basic and applied ecology, such as for improving the effectiveness of conservation biological control measures to promote natural enemies of crop pests. Here, we investigated the aphid diet of two common aphid predators in Central European agroecosystems, the native Coccinella septempunctata (Linnaeus) and the invasive Harmonia axyridis (Pallas; Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) by means of high throughput sequencing (HTS). For acquiring insights into diets of mobile flying insects at landscape scale minimizing trapping bias is important, which imposes methodological challenges for HTS. We therefore assessed the suitability of three field sampling methods (sticky traps, pan traps and hand-collection) as well as new aphid primers for identifying aphid prey consumption by coccinellids through HTS. The new aphid primers facilitate identification to species level in 75% of the European aphid genera investigated. Aphid primer specificity was high in silico and in vitro but low in environmental samples with the methods used, although this could be improved in future studies. For insect trapping we conclude that sticky traps are a suitable method in terms of minimizing sampling bias, contamination risk and trapping success, but compromise on DNA-recovery rate. The aphid diets of both field-captured ladybird species were dominated by Microlophium carnosum, the common nettle aphid. Another common prey was Sitobion avenae (cereal aphid), which got more often detected in C. septempunctata compared to H. axyridis. Around one third of the recovered aphid taxa were common crop pests. We conclude that sampling methodologies need constant revision but that our improved aphid primers offer currently one of the best solutions for broad screenings of coccinellid predation on aphids."
https://openalex.org/W3040581418,"Modern psychological theories postulate that individual differences in prejudice are determined by social and ideological attitudes instead of personality. For example, the dual-process motivational (DPM) model argues that personality does not directly associate with prejudice when controlling for the attitudinal variables that capture the authoritarian-conservatism motivation and the dominance motivation. Previous studies testing the DPM model largely relied on convenience samples and/or European samples, and have produced inconsistent results. Here we examined the extent to which anti-black prejudice was associated with the Big Five personality traits and social and ideological attitudes (authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, political party affiliation) in two large probability samples of the general population (N1 = 3,132; N2 = 2,483) from the American National Election Studies (ANES). We performed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the causal assumptions between the latent variables and used survey weights to generate estimates that were representative of the population. Different from prior theories, across both datasets we found that two personality traits, agreeableness and conscientiousness, were directly associated with anti-black prejudice when controlling for authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and political party affiliation. We also found that a substantial part of the associations between personality traits and anti-black prejudice were mediated through those social and ideological attitudes, which might serve as candidates for prejudice-reduction interventions in the real world."
https://openalex.org/W3039164789,"Staphylococcus aureus is among the leading causes of bacterial infections worldwide. The pathogenicity and establishment of S. aureus infections are tightly linked to its ability to modulate host immunity. Persistent infections are often associated with mutant staphylococcal strains that have decreased susceptibility to antibiotics; however, little is known about how these mutations influence bacterial interaction with the host immune system. Here, we discovered that clinical S. aureus isolates activate human monocytes, leading to cell-surface expression of immune stimulatory natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) ligands on the monocytes. We found that expression of the NKG2D ligand ULBP2 (UL16-binding protein 2) is associated with bacterial degradability and phagolysosomal activity. Moreover, S. aureus-induced ULBP2 expression was linked to altered host cell metabolism, including increased cytoplasmic (iso)citrate levels, reduced glycolytic flux, and functional mitochondrial activity. Interestingly, we found that the ability of S. aureus to induce ULBP2 and proinflammatory cytokines in human monocytes depends on a functional ClpP protease in S. aureus These findings indicate that S. aureus activates ULBP2 in human monocytes through immunometabolic mechanisms and reveal that clpP inactivation may function as a potential immune evasion mechanism. Our results provide critical insight into the interplay between the host immune system and S. aureus that has evolved under the dual selective pressure of host immune responses and antibiotic treatment. Our discovery of an immune stimulatory pathway consisting of human monocyte-based defense against S. aureus suggests that targeting the NKG2D pathway holds potential for managing persistent staphylococcal infections."
https://openalex.org/W3040202395,"Background Monitoring of blood pressure is an important part of management of dengue illness. Large scale studies of temporal trend of blood pressure in adult dengue are lacking. In this study, we examined the differences in time trend of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in patients with and without severe dengue (SD), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and pre-existing hypertension, and elderly versus non-elderly patients. Methods We studied a retrospective cohort from 2005 to 2008 of 6,070 hospitalized adult dengue patients confirmed by polymerase chain reaction or clinical criteria plus positive dengue serology. Dengue severity was defined according to World Health Organization 1997 and 2009 guidelines. We used Bayesian hierarchical Markov models to compare the daily mean SBP and DBP between different subgroups. Analysis was conducted by day of defervescence (denoted as day 0), and day of illness onset (denoted as day 1) respectively. Results SBP decreased to a nadir during the critical phase before defervescence and was significantly lower for patients with SD or DHF, compared with patients without SD or DHF. DBP increased marginally more for patients with SD or DHF in the critical phase before defervescence. By day of defervescence, comparison of patients with and without SD showed significant difference in SBP from day -6 to day +6, except days +1, +3 and +5, and similarly in DBP except days 0, and +4 to +6. Comparison of patients with and without DHF showed significant difference in SBP from day -6 to day -1, but for DBP, significant difference was noted from day -6 to day +6, except day -2 to day 0. By day of illness, SBP differed significantly between patients with and without SD from illness days 1 to 10, and DBP from illness days 7 to 12. Between patients with and without DHF, SBP differed significantly on illness days 1, 2, 4 to 7, while DBP from days 7 to 12. On analysis by days of defervescence or by days of illness, elderly patients and those with hypertension showed consistently higher SBP and DBP throughout their hospitalization, as compared with their younger and non-hypertensive counterparts. Conclusion In SD or DHF, SBP decreased to a nadir around the day of defervescence, and recovered to a level exceeding that in febrile phase by days 2 or 3 post-defervescence. Elderly patients and patients with pre-existing hypertension maintained higher SBP and DBP throughout the duration of dengue infection."

Methods Data were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (Nstudy sample = 3,540). Results About 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratio's [aOR] ≤ .070). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.26-1.70). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.45-0.67). Those with pre-outbreak respiratory problems (aOR = 2.75, 95% CI = 2.11-3.57), heart problems (aOR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.34-2.92) and diabetes (aOR = 3.12, 95% CI = 2.02-4.82) perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as higher than others. However, respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory problems and diabetes did not more often take preventive measures. Conclusions Vulnerable patients more often recognize that they are at risk becoming ill when infected by the coronavirus, but many do not take preventive measures. Interventions to stimulate the use of preventive measures should pay additional attention to physically vulnerable patients, males and those with lower education levels."
https://openalex.org/W3038425325,"Dietary restriction and reduced reproduction have been linked to long lifespans in the vast majority of species tested. Although decreased mitochondrial mass and/or function are hallmarks of aging, little is known about the mechanisms by which these organelles contribute to physiological aging or to the effects of lifespan-extending interventions, particularly with respect to oxidative phosphorylation and energy production. Here, we employed the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to examine the effects of inhibition of germline proliferation and dietary restriction, both of which extend the lifespan of C. elegans, on mitochondrial respiratory activity in whole animals and isolated organelles. We found that oxygen consumption rates and mitochondrial mass were reduced in wild-type (WT) C. elegans subjected to bacterial deprivation (BD) compared with animals fed ad libitum (AL). In contrast, BD decreased the rate of oxygen uptake but not mitochondrial mass in germline-less glp-1(e2144ts) mutants. Interestingly, mitochondria isolated from animals subjected to BD and/or inhibition of germline proliferation showed no differences in complex I-mediated respiratory activity compared to control mitochondria, whereas both interventions enhanced the efficiency with which mitochondria utilized lipids as respiratory substrates. Notably, the combination of BD and inhibition of germline proliferation further increased mitochondrial lipid oxidation compared to either intervention alone. We also detected a striking correlation between lifespan extension in response to BD and/or inhibition of germline proliferation and the capacity of C. elegans to generate ATP from lipids. Our results thus suggest that the ability to oxidize lipids may be determinant in enhanced longevity."
https://openalex.org/W3038503020,"Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by pathogenic variants in mismatch repair (MMR) genes that predispose individuals to different malignancies, such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer. Current guidelines recommended testing for LS in individuals with newly diagnosed CRC to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality in relatives. Economic evaluations in support of such approach, however, are not available in Italy. We developed a decision-analytic model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of LS screening from the perspective of the Italian National Health System. Three testing strategies: the sequencing of all MMR genes without prior tumor analysis (Strategy 1), a sequential IHC and MS-MLPA analysis (Strategy 2), and an age-targeted strategy with a revised Bethesda criteria assessment before IHC and methylation-specific MLPA for patients ≥ than 70 years old (Strategy 3) were analyzed and compared to the “no testing” strategy. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in relatives after colonoscopy, aspirin prophylaxis and an intensive gynecological surveillance were estimated through a Markov model. Assuming a CRC incidence rate of 0.09% and a share of patients affected by LS equal to 2.81%, the number of detected pathogenic variants among CRC cases ranges, in a given year, between 910 and 1167 depending on the testing strategy employed. The testing strategies investigated, provided one-time to the entire eligible population (CRC patients), were associated with an overall cost ranging between €1,753,059.93-€10,388,000.00. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the Markov model ranged from €941.24 /QALY to €1,681.93 /QALY, thus supporting that “universal testing” versus “no testing” is cost-effective, but not necessarily in comparison with age-targeted strategies. This is the first economic evaluation on different testing strategies for LS in Italy. The results might support the introduction of cost-effective recommendations for LS screening in Italy."
https://openalex.org/W3039521110,"Introduction Between 2014 and 2017, a program aimed at reducing HIV risk and promoting safe sex through consistent use of condoms sought to work through addressing social and economic vulnerabilities and strengthening community-led organizations (COs) of female sex workers (FSWs). This study examines if the program was effective by studying relationship between strengthening of COs, vulnerability reduction, and sustaining of consistent condom use behavior among FSWs. Methods We used a longitudinal study design to assess the change in outcomes. A three-stage sampling design was used to select FSWs for the study. Panel data of 2085 FSWs selected from 38 COs across five states of India was used to examine the change in various outcomes from 2015 (Survey Round 1) to 2017 (Survey Round 2). The CO level program pillar measuring institutional development assessed performance of COs in six domains critical for any organization’s functionality and sustainability: governance, project management, financial management, program monitoring, advocacy and networking, and resource mobilization. Overall, 32 indicators from all these domains were used to compute the CO strength score. A score was computed by taking mean of average dimension scores. The overall score was divided into two groups based on the median cutoff; COs which scored below the median were considered to have low CO strength, while COs which scored above or equal to median were considered to have high CO strength. Multivariable regression modeling techniques were used to examine the effect of program pillars on outcome measures. Results Analyses showed a significant improvement in the strength of the COs over time; percentage of COs having high strength improved from 50% in 2015 to 87% in Round 2. The improvement in CO’s strength increased financial security (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 2.18, p<0.01), social welfare security (AOR: 1.71, p<0.01), and socio-legal security (AOR: 2.20, p<0.01) among FSWs. Further, improvement in financial security led to significant increase in consistent condom use with client among FSWs (AOR: 1.69, p<0.01) who were members of COs having high strength. Sustained consistent condom use was positively associated with young age (<30 years), ability to negotiate with clients for condom use, membership in self-help groups, high self-efficacy, self-confidence, and client solicitation in streets and brothels. Conclusions Improving financial security and strengthening FSW led CO can improve sustained and consistent condom use. In addition, the program should focus on enhancing ability of FSWs to negotiate with clients for condom use, promote membership in self-help groups and target FSWs who are 30 years or older, and soliciting from homes to sustain consistent condom use across all FSWs."

We describe subsequent temporal changes in adolescent TB disease notification rates for the decade 2005-2015.We conducted an analysis of patient-level adolescent (age 10-19 years) TB disease data, obtained from an electronic TB register in the Breede Valley sub-district, Western Cape Province, South Africa, for 2005-2015. Numerators were annual TB notifications (HIV-related and HIV-unrelated); denominators were mid-year population estimates. Period averages of TB rates were obtained using time series modeling. Temporal trends in TB rates were explored using the Mann-Kendall test.The average adolescent TB disease notification rate was 477 per 100,000 for all TB patients (all-TB) and 361 per 100,000 for microbiologically-confirmed patients. The adolescent all-TB rate declined by 45% from 662 to 361 per 100,000 and the microbiologically-confirmed TB rate by 38% from 492 to 305 per 100,000 between 2005-2015, driven mainly by rapid decreases for the period 2005-2009. There was a statistically significant negative temporal trend in both all-TB (per 100,000) (declined by 48%; from 662 to 343; p = 0·028) and microbiologically confirmed TB (per 100,000) (declined by 49%; from 492 to 252; p = 0·027) for 2005-2009, which was not observed for the period 2009-2015 (rose 5%; from 343 to 361; p = 0·764 and rose 21%; from 252 to 305; p = 1·000, respectively).We observed an encouraging fall in adolescent TB disease rates between 2005-2009 with a subsequent plateau during 2010-2015, suggesting that additional interventions are needed to sustain initial advances in TB control."
https://openalex.org/W3039933522,"Resistin and resistin-like molecules are pleiotropic cytokines that are involved in inflammatory diseases. Our previous work suggested that resistin has the potential to be used as a biomarker and therapeutic target for human pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, data are limited on the distribution of resistin in healthy human organs. In this study, we used our newly developed anti-human resistin (hResistin) antibody to immunohistochemically detect the expression, localization, and intracellular/extracellular compartmentalization of hResistin in a full human tissue panel from healthy individuals. The potential cross reactivity of this monoclonal anti-hResistin IgG1 with normal human tissues also was verified. Results showed that hResistin is broadly distributed and principally localized in the cytoplasmic granules of macrophages scattered in the interstitium of most human tissues. Bone marrow hematopoietic precursor cells also exhibited hResistin signals in their cytoplasmic granules. Additionally, hResistin labeling was observed in the cytoplasm of nervous system cells. Notably, the cytokine activity of hResistin was illustrated by positively stained extracellular material in most human tissues. These data indicate that our generated antibody binds to the secreted hResistin and support its potential use for immunotherapy to reduce circulating hResistin levels in human disease. Our findings comprehensively document the basal expression patterns of hResistin protein in normal human tissues, suggest a critical role of this cytokine in normal and pathophysiologic inflammatory processes, and offer key insights for using our antibody in future pharmacokinetic studies and immunotherapeutic strategies."

Recent studies have discussed the fact that the presence of T. gondii cysts in the brain and the resulting biochemical and immunological mechanisms could be linked to neurobehavioral disorders. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential impact of chronic toxoplasmosis on sleepiness and on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity in OSA obese patients.A case control study on obese patients screened for OSA was performed. According to the sleep disorder and matched based on gender, age and body mass index (BMI), two groups of obese patients were selected from our sample collection database. All patients were tested for toxoplasmosis serological status measuring anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM levels. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to assess the impact of chronic toxoplasmosis on sleepiness and OSA severity.107 obese patients suffering from OSA were included in the study (median age: 53.3 years Interquartile range (IQR): [41.9-59.9]; median BMI: 39.4 kg/m2 IQR: [35.5-44.1], apnea-hypopnea index = 27.5 events/h [10.7-49.9]). Chronic toxoplasmosis was present in 63.4% and 70.7% of patients with or without sleepiness (p = 0.48), respectively and was not associated either to sleepiness (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: [0.52; 2.33], p = 0.64) or OSA severity (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: [0.51; 5.98] p = 0.37).Although chronic Toxoplasma infection in immunocompetent humans has been associated to several behavioral disorders or pathologies in recent literature, we demonstrate here that chronic toxoplasmosis is not associated to sleepiness and to sleep apnea syndrome severity in obese patients suspected of sleep apnea syndrome."

By automating extraction in conjunction with standardized terminology, the quality and consistency of data utilized for research and clinical purposes would be substantially improved. Here, we set out to develop and validate a framework to extract pertinent clinical conditions for traumatic brain injury (TBI) from computed tomography (CT) reports.We developed tbiExtractor, which extends pyConTextNLP, a regular expression algorithm using negation detection and contextual features, to create a framework for extracting TBI common data elements from radiology reports. The algorithm inputs radiology reports and outputs a structured summary containing 27 clinical findings with their respective annotations. Development and validation of the algorithm was completed using two physician annotators as the gold standard.tbiExtractor displayed high sensitivity (0.92-0.94) and specificity (0.99) when compared to the gold standard. The algorithm also demonstrated a high equivalence (94.6%) with the annotators. A majority of clinical findings (85%) had minimal errors (F1 Score ≥ 0.80). When compared to annotators, tbiExtractor extracted information in significantly less time (0.3 sec vs 1.7 min per report).tbiExtractor is a validated algorithm for extraction of TBI common data elements from radiology reports. This automation reduces the time spent to extract structured data and improves the consistency of data extracted. Lastly, tbiExtractor can be used to stratify subjects into groups based on visible damage by partitioning the annotations of the pertinent clinical conditions on a radiology report."
https://openalex.org/W3039539764,"To explore the molecular mechanism of the effect of Bacillus cereus PAS38 on the immunity of broilers, sixty 7-day-old broilers were divided into two groups with three replicates. The control group was fed with basal diet, and the treatment group was fed with basal diet containing Bacillus cereus PAS38 1×106 CFU/g. Thymus and bursa of fabricius were taken from two groups of broilers at the age of 42 days, total RNA was extracted, differential gene library was constructed by SSH technology, and immune-related differential genes were screened. Then, we used siRNA to interfere with the expression of some differential genes in the original generation lymphocytes of broiler blood to detect the change of cytokines mRNA expression level. A total of 42 immune-related differentially expressed genes were screened, including 22 up-regulated genes and 20 down-regulated genes. When 7 differentially up-regulated genes associated with enhanced immune function were interfered with in lymphocytes, some immune-promoting cytokines were down-regulated. These results showed that Bacillus cereus PAS38 might up-regulate the expression of JCHAIN, PRDX1, CD3E, CDK6 and other genes in immune organs of broilers, thereby affecting the development of immune organs, the expression of various cytokines and the transduction of immune signals, improving the immune capacity of broilers."
https://openalex.org/W3039564068,"Digital datasets in several health care facilities, as hospitals and prehospital services, accumulated data from thousands of patients for more than a decade. In general, there is no local team with enough experts with the required different skills capable of analyzing them in entirety. The integration of those abilities usually demands a relatively long-period and is cost. Considering that scenario, this paper proposes a new Feature Sensitivity technique that can automatically deal with a large dataset. It uses a criterion-based sampling strategy from the Optimization based on Phylogram Analysis. Called FS-opa, the new approach seems proper for dealing with any types of raw data from health centers and manipulate their entire datasets. Besides, FS-opa can find the principal features for the construction of inference models without depending on expert knowledge of the problem domain. The selected features can be combined with usual statistical or machine learning methods to perform predictions. The new method can mine entire datasets from scratch. FS-opa was evaluated using a relatively large dataset from electronic health records of mental disorder prehospital services in Brazil. Cox’s approach was integrated to FS-opa to generate survival analysis models related to the length of stay (LOS) in hospitals, assuming that it is a relevant aspect that can benefit estimates of the efficiency of hospitals and the quality of patient treatments. Since FS-opa can work with raw datasets, no knowledge from the problem domain was used to obtain the preliminary prediction models found. Results show that FS-opa succeeded in performing a feature sensitivity analysis using only the raw data available. In this way, FS-opa can find the principal features without bias of an inference model, since the proposed method does not use it. Moreover, the experiments show that FS-opa can provide models with a useful trade-off according to their representativeness and parsimony. It can benefit further analyses by experts since they can focus on aspects that benefit problem modeling."

There is a necessity for expanding and improving the available information on these factors in order to make better dose models for specific scenarios. This paper describes the results of a field experiment with broiler chickens on the transfer factor (Ff) and concentration ratio (CR) for the long-term intake of 241Am and 137Cs with grass meal and soil. The broilers were divided into two groups, each group had nine subgroups and each subgroup had three broilers. The radionuclide concentrations in the feed and the thigh muscle, thigh bone, and liver of 54 broilers divided between the grass meal and soil groups were evaluated by gamma spectrometry for 241Am and 137Cs. The duration of feeding with ""contaminated"" sources ranged between 1-70 days. The equilibrium stage of 241Am in muscle and bone occurs on the 1st and 40th day, respectively; for 137Cs in muscle- 30th days of intake and for liver and bone- 7th days. For 241Am, the liver did not reach equilibrium stage during the 70 days of intake. Ff of 137Cs in the ""forage-muscle"" and ""soil-muscle"" systems were determined as 1.9±0.3 and 0.18±0.05; Ff of 241Am in the ""soil-muscle"" system was-7.5×10-5."
https://openalex.org/W3039295055,"Sea barley Hordeum marinum is an important germplasm resource. However, the origin of this tetraploid H. marinum subsp. gussoneanum is still unclear, which has caused great perplexity to the exploration and utilization of germplasm resources. We used two single-copy nuclear genes, thioredoxin-like gene (TRX) and waxy1 gene encoding granule-bound starch synthase (WAXY1) to analyze 41 accessions of Hordeum marinum. The phylogenies of different genes told different story of evolution of tetraploids of H. marinum subsp. gussoneanum. The phylogenetic trees showed that two distinct copies of sequences from both genes were detected for some accessions of the tetraploids of H. marinum subsp. gussoneanum, and diploid marinum might also contribute to the origin and evolution of the tetraploid gussoneanum. Our findings suggested that tetraploid more likely originated from the diploids of H. marinum subsp. gussoneanum and another ancestor that might be an extinct unknown diploid species. Homogenization of gene in tetraploids also occurred after polyploidization as both TRX and WAXY1 sequences in some accessions of tetraploid H. marinum subsp. gussoneanum cannot be distinguished, indicating the complicated evolution of this tetraploid."
https://openalex.org/W3039325750,"The aim of the paper is two-fold. First, we show that structure finding with the PC algorithm can be inherently unstable and requires further operational constraints in order to consistently obtain models that are faithful to the data. We propose a methodology to stabilise the structure finding process, minimising both false positive and false negative error rates. This is demonstrated with synthetic data. Second, to apply the proposed structure finding methodology to a data set comprising single-voxel Magnetic Resonance Spectra of normal brain and three classes of brain tumours, to elucidate the associations between brain tumour types and a range of observed metabolites that are known to be relevant for their characterisation. The data set is bootstrapped in order to maximise the robustness of feature selection for nominated target variables. Specifically, Conditional Independence maps (CI-maps) built from the data and their derived Bayesian networks have been used. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is built from CI-maps, being a major challenge the minimization of errors in the graph structure. This work presents empirical evidence on how to reduce false positive errors via the False Discovery Rate, and how to identify appropriate parameter settings to improve the False Negative Reduction. In addition, several node ordering policies are investigated that transform the graph into a DAG. The obtained results show that ordering nodes by strength of mutual information can recover a representative DAG in a reasonable time, although a more accurate graph can be recovered using a random order of samples at the expense of increasing the computation time."
https://openalex.org/W3040605987,"Purpose While many tests and indices are available to identify glaucoma progression, using them in combinations may decrease overall specificity. The aim of this study was to develop a framework for assessing glaucoma progression using structural and functional indices jointly for a fixed specificity. Methods The study included 337 eyes of 207 patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma selected from the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study or the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study. All patients had at least 9 visits. Each visit had retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and mean sensitivity from static automated perimetry (SAP MS) measured within a one-month window. Simple linear regression was applied to assess deterioration in each index for series of 5 to 9 visits. To identify progression using the two indices jointly, marginal significance levels set at a specificity of 95% were derived for two criteria: ANY (worsening on either RNFLT or SAP MS) and ALL (worsening on both RNFLT and SAP MS). Positive rate (percentage of eyes flagged as progressing) was determined individually for each index, as well as for the ANY and ALL criteria. Results Compared to SAP MS, RNFLT had higher positive rates (15% to 45%) for all series lengths. For the joint analyses, the positive rate was on average 12% higher for the ANY criterion compared to the ALL criterion. While RNFLT-alone had comparable positive rates and time-to-detection as the ANY criterion, each uniquely identified a subset of eyes (Kappa = 0.55 to 0.75). Conclusions This study provides a simple framework for assessing glaucoma progression with data from two tests jointly, without compromising specificity. This framework can be extended to include two or more parameters, can accommodate global or regional indices, and can eventually be used with novel parameters identified as predictive of glaucoma progression."
https://openalex.org/W3036333032,"Calculating forward and inverse kinematics for robotic agents is one of the most time-intensive tasks when controlling the robot movement in any environment. This calculation is then encoded to control the motors and validated in a simulator. The feedback produced by the simulation can be used to correct the code or to implement the code can be implemented directly in the robotic agent. However, the simulation process executes instructions that are not native to the robotic agents, extending development time or making it preferable to validate the code directly on the robot, which in some cases might result in severe damage to it. The use of Domain-Specific Languages help reduce development time in simulation tasks. These languages simplify code generation by describing tasks through an easy-to-understand language and free the user to use a framework or programming API directly for testing purposes. This article presents the language PyDSLRep, which is characterized by the connection and manipulation of movement in mobile robotic agents in the V-Rep simulation environment. This language is tested in three different environments by twenty people, against the framework given by V-Rep, demonstrating that PyDSLRep reduces the average development time by 45.22%, and the lines of code by 76.40% against the Python framework of V-Rep."
