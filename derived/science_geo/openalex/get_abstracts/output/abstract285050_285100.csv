https://openalex.org/W1977609017,"Considerable doubt is cast on the validity of past satellite measurements of micrometeoroid fluxes in which piezoelectric microphones have been used as detectors. Data have been obtained from satellite and laboratory experiments which show that the microphone crystals emit noise when subject to slowly varying temperatures. The rate of noise is consistent with past flight data which have previously been interpreted on the basis of micrometeoroid impacts. These measurements have given rise to the theory that the earth is surrounded by a cloud of dust, although no satisfactory mechanism has yet been found to explain this apparent phenomenon. On the basis of the results reported here, it now appears that whether or not a concentration of dust exists in the vicinity of the earth, the data from satellite microphone measurements should not be used to support such a hypothesis."

Preliminary measurements also indicate the uptake of dissolved organic substances, suggestive of an apparently viable, actively metabolizing community at these depths."
https://openalex.org/W2074011642,"Anthropocentrism is proposed as a valid and necessary point of view for mankind to adopt for consideration of his place in nature. Our current ecological problems do not stem from an anthropocentric attitude per se, but from one too narrowly conceived. Anthropocentrism is consistent with a philosophy that affirms the essential interrelatedness of things and that values all items in nature since no event is without some effect on wholes of which we are parts. The ecological crisis is viewed as an inevitable crisis in human evolution. Through cultures knowledge becomes cumulative. A crisis occurs when our knowledge of nature, which determines our power to exploit nature, exceeds our knowledge of how to use knowledge for our own survival and for improvement in the quality of our lives. An anthropocentric belief in the value, meaningfulness, and creative potential of the human phenomenon is considered a necessary motivating factor to participatory evolution which, in turn, may be requisite to the future survival of the human species and its cultural values."
https://openalex.org/W2088166709,"Analysis of several well-documented specimens from each of the three volcanic series on Oahu gives the following mean ratios of Sr(87) to Sr(86): the Waianae series, 0.7030 +/- 0.00010 (sigma); the Koolau series, 0.70385+/- 0.00009 (sigma); and the Honolulu series, 0.7029 ++/- 0.00006 ( sigma). The mean ratio of Sr(87) to Sr(86) of the Koolau series specimens is significantly higher than the means of the other two series. With one exception, significant differences in Sr(87)/ Sr(86) within a series were not found, even though some large compositional differences existed."

https://openalex.org/W2012129352,"The recently reported Pronounced decrease in shear strength of serpentine-bearing rocks at 30 to 40 kilobars in the temperature range 300 degrees to 520 degrees C may be attributed to the transformation of serpentine to a Pressure-dependent, 10-angstrom,2: 1 layer silicate plus brucite and periclase. This reaction increases density by about 8.5 percent."

https://openalex.org/W2064530395,The percentage of continent antipodal to ocean on the earth is compared with a distribution obtained by a Monte Carlo method. It is concluded that the present antipodal arrangement of continents and oceans has less than 1 chance in 14 of being caused by a random process.
