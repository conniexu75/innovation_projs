https://openalex.org/W2415048585,"Formaldehyde has been used extensively for chemically modifying proteins and for inactivating toxins and viruses, although the precise mode of its action is little understood. In the case of tobacco mosaic virus, however, Fraenkel-Conrat (1) and Staehelin (2) have shown that inactivation of the virus is due to interaction of formaldehyde with the amino groups of adenine, cytosine, and guanine in the ribonucleic acid component. Fraenkel-Conrat has suggested that the products of formylation are Schiff bases, of the type R N = CH,. Recently, Hoard has shown by means of a form01 titration that the amino group of cytidylic acid combines with one molecule of formaldehyde in the limit of high formaldehyde concentration, which is consistent with Fraenkel-Conrat’s suggestion (3). Fraenkel-Conrat (I), Staehelin (2), and Zamenhof et al. (4) have all reported that native DNA from several sources does not react with formaldehyde under the same conditions used for the reaction with RNA. The conclusion drawn was that amino groups involved in hydrogen bonds do not react with formaldehyde. If this is true, then the extent of reaction of a particular nucleic acid with formaldehyde, for a given set of experimental conditions (pH, temperature, ionic strength, and formaldehyde concentration) should reflect quantitatively the fraction of amino groups involved in hydrogen bonds. It has recently been demonstrated that the temperature dependence of the rate of reaction with formaldehyde is considerably greater for TMVl-RN,4 than for a mixture of the constituent mononucleotides. Qualitatively this has been explained on the basis of thermal rupture of hydrogen bonds in the intact nucleic acid at elevated temperatures, which make the amino groups more accessible to the reagent (5). In view of these considerations, the present work was undertaken to explore the possibility of using the reaction with formaldehyde as a quantitative measure of the fraction of hydrogen bonded amino groups in nucleic acids. First, we consider in detail the effect of temperature and ionic strength on the rate of reaction of formaldehyde with monoand polynucleotides. This leads to a hypothesis concerning the mode of action of formaldehyde which is tested and verified in the following section. Finally, this information is used to establish conditions for determining the helical content of TMV-RNA. The results of such a determination are compared with other estimates."

https://openalex.org/W2023469948,"Basal skin resistance was measured continuously in sleeping human subjects. Instead of a hypothesized fall in basal skin resistance during periods of ""dreaming"" or emergent stage 1 electro-encephalographic activity, there was a rise which generally coincided with the ""dreaming"" period. This finding, along with other recent studies, indicates that this stage of sleep is not just a light stage of sleep but is unique neurophysiologically."

https://openalex.org/W2134068195,"primarily in succinic, fumaric, and malic acids, suggested that most animals share the main pathway demonstrated in the oyster (2), namely, the carboxylation of propionate to form succinate, which is then metabolized through the citric acid cycle. The flatworms, Stylochus zebra and Bdelloura candida, however, had relatively little Cl4 in succinic acid and a large amount in an acid not identifiable with those of the cycle (1). The purpose of the experiments described in this report was to determine the principal pathways of COz fixation in free-living flatworms. The common fresh-water planarian Dugesia tigrina, the two marine turbellarians of the previous study, and a trematode Entobdella bumpusi were found to exhibit very similar patterns of labeling of organic acids after incubation for various periods in water containing NaHC1403. These flatworms form a series of increasing closeness of association with larger animals, from Dugesia, which has no association, to Stylochus, which inhabits the same shell as hermit crabs, to Bdelloura, which attaches to the legs and gills of the horseshoe crab. The monogenetic trematode E. bump& is an ectoparasite of the sting ray. The general results indicated that, although propionate is utilized by flatworms, the principal carboxylation in the absence of added substrate is the conversion of pyruvate to malate."

Substitution in the benzene ring of saccharin with the electron-withdrawing nitro group gives a bitter tasting substance. Substitution with an electron-donating group results in a sweet taste. Perhaps a ""lock and key"" fit at a receptor site is necessary for taste."

https://openalex.org/W2051554218,"ON adding heavy metal salts to cells of Chlorella vulgaris shaken in 10−3 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, the endogenous respiration often increased temporarily but, with the exception of silver, high concentrations caused no respiratory inhibition for many hours. Copper, however, differed from all other metals tested (barium, manganese, nickel and lead inter alia) in that its effect on respiration depended on the environmental conditions during the period of treatment. If the suspensions of Chlorella were shaken continuously, 10−1 M copper sulphate was not inhibitory for 7–20 hr., but if the shaking was stopped, concentrations lower than 10−3 M rapidly became toxic. Experiments were carried out in respirometer flasks, using about 3 × 108 cells suspended in 3 ml. of buffer. Copper was determined by the method of Abbott and Polhill1. Copper sulphate was tipped from the side-arms, and shortly afterwards one set was brought to rest while the remainder was shaken for 3 hr. Thereafter, caustic soda was added to the centre wells of the flasks, which were then shaken for a further period during which respiration was measured. The toxic effect on unshaken cells increased if the treatment was carried out in narrow centrifuge tubes."

In both sections CaCl(2) produced marked stimulation, while NaCl had no effect. In this tissue stimulation of respiration does not appear to be directly related to metabolic ion accumulation."

During ageing an increase of collagen occurs4 leading to a decreased ratio of mucopolysaccharide to collagen, although the absolute amount of mucopolysaccharide remains constant4."

https://openalex.org/W2069477427,"ALTHOUGH the metabolism of carbohydrates by mammalian liver has been extensively studied, relatively little information exists regarding their metabolism by avian liver. It has been found that slices of liver from the domestic fowl (in these experiments a strain of White Leghorn) when incubated at 41.3° in a saline buffered with phosphate oxidize fructose, the rate of oxygen uptake being linear for at least 3 hr. and considerably in excess of that of control slices incubated in the absence of fructose. This was found with both male and female birds up to 1 year of age (the oldest examined) and did not depend on the bird being in lay, non-laying or in moult, or whether it was fasted or fed. Of other substrates tested in addition to fructose, sorbose, pyruvate, succinate and glutamate supported an increased oxygen uptake. Glucose, galactose, man-nose, D-tagatose, mannitol, dulcitol, sorbitol, ribose, glycerol, β-glycerophosphate, 2- and 3-phosphoglycerate, citrate, malate and β-hydroxybutyrate did not increase the uptake of oxygen above that of control slices in the absence of added substrate. The increased oxygen uptake in the presence of fructose was also obtained at 37.5°. In contrast, the oxygen uptake of slices of rat liver was not enhanced by fructose at either temperature. The uptake of fructose by slices of avian liver was not affected by concentrations of glucose up to twelve times that of fructose and was only slightly suppressed by concentrations of glucosamine which suppressed glucose uptake by 80–85 per cent."

https://openalex.org/W2000835304,"ALTHOUGH it has been well established that the blood of the laying hen contains phosphorus compounds, the quantities of which are increased immediately preceding and during ovulation1,2, the nature of some of these substances has only recently been subject to chemical investigation. Dilution of plasma from the laying hen results in the precipitation of a complex of lipid and a phosphoprotein, though by far the greater proportion of the total phosphoprotein present in the plasma remains in the supernatant2. Designation of these materials as phosphoproteins has rested entirely on the finding that inorganic phosphate is liberated when they are incubated with dilute alkali3, but the manner in which the phosphorus is bound has not been reported. Phosphoproteins in general and particularly that from egg yolk, contain their phosphorus as phosphorylserine4,5, and this has now been sought in acid hydro-lysates of both the phosphoprotein fractions of the plasma."
