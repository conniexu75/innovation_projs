https://openalex.org/W2000589976,"Very rare cases of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) harbor chromosomal translocations that involve NOTCH1 , a gene encoding a transmembrane receptor that regulates normal T cell development. Here, we report that more than 50% of human T-ALLs, including tumors from all major molecular oncogenic subtypes, have activating mutations that involve the extracellular heterodimerization domain and/or the C-terminal PEST domain of NOTCH1. These findings greatly expand the role of activated NOTCH1 in the molecular pathogenesis of human T-ALL and provide a strong rationale for targeted therapies that interfere with NOTCH signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2142827688,"Traditional theories of moral psychology emphasize reasoning and “higher cognition,” while more recent work emphasizes the role of emotion. The present fMRI data support a theory of moral judgment according to which both “cognitive” and emotional processes play crucial and sometimes mutually competitive roles. The present results indicate that brain regions associated with abstract reasoning and cognitive control (including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) are recruited to resolve difficult personal moral dilemmas in which utilitarian values require “personal” moral violations, violations that have previously been associated with increased activity in emotion-related brain regions. Several regions of frontal and parietal cortex predict intertrial differences in moral judgment behavior, exhibiting greater activity for utilitarian judgments. We speculate that the controversy surrounding utilitarian moral philosophy reflects an underlying tension between competing subsystems in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2135259298,"Coca-Cola (Coke) and Pepsi are nearly identical in chemical composition, yet humans routinely display strong subjective preferences for one or the other. This simple observation raises the important question of how cultural messages combine with content to shape our perceptions; even to the point of modifying behavioral preferences for a primary reward like a sugared drink. We delivered Coke and Pepsi to human subjects in behavioral taste tests and also in passive experiments carried out during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two conditions were examined: (1) anonymous delivery of Coke and Pepsi and (2) brand-cued delivery of Coke and Pepsi. For the anonymous task, we report a consistent neural response in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex that correlated with subjects' behavioral preferences for these beverages. In the brand-cued experiment, brand knowledge for one of the drinks had a dramatic influence on expressed behavioral preferences and on the measured brain responses."
https://openalex.org/W2049105226,"We identified a previously unknown riboswitch class in bacteria that is selectively triggered by glycine. A representative of these glycine-sensing RNAs from Bacillus subtilis operates as a rare genetic on switch for the gcvT operon, which codes for proteins that form the glycine cleavage system. Most glycine riboswitches integrate two ligand-binding domains that function cooperatively to more closely approximate a two-state genetic switch. This advanced form of riboswitch may have evolved to ensure that excess glycine is efficiently used to provide carbon flux through the citric acid cycle and maintain adequate amounts of the amino acid for protein synthesis. Thus, riboswitches perform key regulatory roles and exhibit complex performance characteristics that previously had been observed only with protein factors."
https://openalex.org/W1996800093,"Space used by animals increases with increasing body size. Energy requirements alone can explain how population density decreases, but not the steep rate at which home range area increases. We present a general mechanistic model that predicts the frequency of interaction, spatial overlap, and loss of resources to neighbors. Extensive empirical evidence supports the model, demonstrating that spatial constraints on defense cause exclusivity of home range use to decrease with increasing body size. In large mammals, over 90% of available resources may be lost to neighbors. Our model offers a general framework to understand animal space use and sociality."
https://openalex.org/W1993594397,"Behavioral studies suggest that making a decision involves representing the overall desirability of all available actions and then selecting that action that is most desirable. Physiological studies have proposed that neurons in the parietal cortex play a role in selecting movements for execution. To test the hypothesis that these parietal neurons encode the subjective desirability of making particular movements, we exploited Nash's game theoretic equilibrium, during which the subjective desirability of multiple actions should be equal for human players. Behavior measured during a strategic game suggests that monkeys' choices, like those of humans, are guided by subjective desirability. Under these conditions, activity in the parietal cortex was correlated with the relative subjective desirability of actions irrespective of the specific combination of reward magnitude, reward probability, and response probability associated with each action. These observations may help place many recent findings regarding the posterior parietal cortex into a common conceptual framework."
https://openalex.org/W1994124220,"Most cortical interneurons arise from the subcortical telencephalon, but the molecules that control their migration remain largely unidentified. Here, we show that different isoforms of Neuregulin-1 are expressed in the developing cortex and in the route that migrating interneurons follow toward the cortex, whereas a population of the migrating interneurons express ErbB4, a receptor for Neuregulin-1. The different isoforms of Neuregulin-1 act as short- and long-range attractants for migrating interneurons, and perturbing ErbB4 function in vitro decreases the number of interneurons that tangentially migrate to the cortex. In vivo, loss of Neuregulin-1/ErbB4 signaling causes an alteration in the tangential migration of cortical interneurons and a reduction in the number of GABAergic interneurons in the postnatal cortex. These observations provide evidence that Neuregulin-1 and its ErbB4 receptor directly control neuronal migration in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2165194928,"Almost all discussions of prebiotic chemistry assume that amino acids, nucleotides, and possibly other monomers were first formed on the Earth or brought to it in comets and meteorites, and then condensed nonenzymatically to form oligomeric products. However, attempts to demonstrate plausibly prebiotic polymerization reactions have met with limited success. We show that carbonyl sulfide (COS), a simple volcanic gas, brings about the formation of peptides from amino acids under mild conditions in aqueous solution. Depending on the reaction conditions and additives used, exposure of α-amino acids to COS generates peptides in yields of up to 80% in minutes to hours at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2165343647,"Correct neuronal migration and positioning during cortical development are essential for proper brain function. Mutations of the LIS1 gene result in human lissencephaly (smooth brain), which features misplaced cortical neurons and disarrayed cerebral lamination. However, the mechanism by which LIS1 regulates neuronal migration remains unknown. Using RNA interference (RNAi), we found that the binding partner of LIS1, NudE-like protein (Ndel1, formerly known as NUDEL), positively regulates dynein activity by facilitating the interaction between LIS1 and dynein. Loss of function of Ndel1, LIS1, or dynein in developing neocortex impairs neuronal positioning and causes the uncoupling of the centrosome and nucleus. Overexpression of LIS1 partially rescues the positioning defect caused by Ndel1 RNAi but not dynein RNAi, whereas overexpression of Ndel1 does not rescue the phenotype induced by LIS1 RNAi. These results provide strong evidence that Ndel1 interacts with LIS1 to sustain the function of dynein, which in turn impacts microtubule organization, nuclear translocation, and neuronal positioning."
https://openalex.org/W2139261345,"Ablation of the LIS1-interacting protein Nde1 (formerly mNudE) in mouse produces a small brain (microcephaly), with the most dramatic reduction affecting the cerebral cortex. While cortical lamination is mostly preserved, the mutant cortex has fewer neurons and very thin superficial cortical layers (II to IV). BrdU birthdating revealed retarded and modestly disorganized neuronal migration; however, more dramatic defects on mitotic progression, mitotic orientation, and mitotic chromosome localization in cortical progenitors were observed in Nde1 mutant embryos. The small cerebral cortex seems to reflect both reduced progenitor cell division and altered neuronal cell fates. In vitro analysis demonstrated that Nde1 is essential for centrosome duplication and mitotic spindle assembly. Our data show that mitotic spindle function and orientation are essential for normal development of mammalian cerebral cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2080185027,"Focal activation of glutamate receptors in distal dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells triggers voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel-mediated plateau potentials that are confined to the stimulated dendrite. We examined the role of dendritic K+ conductances in determining the amplitude, duration, and spatial compartmentalization of plateau potentials. Manipulations that blocked SK-type Ca2+-activated K+ channels, including apamin and BAPTA dialysis, increased the duration of plateau potentials without affecting their amplitude or compartmentalization. Manipulations that blocked Kv4.2 A-type K+ channels, including a dominant-negative Kv4.2 construct and 4-aminopyridine, increased the amplitude of plateau potentials by allowing them to recruit neighboring dendrites. Prolongation of plateau potentials or block of Kv4.2 channels at branch points facilitated the ability of dendritic excitation to trigger fast action potentials. SK channels thus underlie repolarization of dendritic plateau potentials, whereas Kv4.2 channels confine these potentials to single dendritic branches, and both act in concert to regulate synaptic integration."
https://openalex.org/W2094758748,"Little is known of the fate of viruses involved in long-term obligatory associations with eukaryotes. For example, many species of parasitoid wasps have symbiotic viruses to manipulate host defenses and to allow development of parasitoid larvae. The complete nucleotide sequence of the DNA enclosed in the virus particles injected by a parasitoid wasp revealed a complex organization, resembling a eukaryote genomic region more than a viral genome. Although endocellular symbiont genomes have undergone a dramatic loss of genes, the evolution of symbiotic viruses appears to be characterized by extensive duplication of virulence genes coding for truncated versions of cellular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2110961285,"Amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) accumulation in specific brain regions is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously reported that a well-characterized acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor, CP-113,818, inhibits Aβ production in cell-based experiments. Here, we assessed the efficacy of CP-113,818 in reducing AD-like pathology in the brains of transgenic mice expressing human APP751 containing the London (V717I) and Swedish (K670M/N671L) mutations. Two months of treatment with CP-113,818 reduced the accumulation of amyloid plaques by 88%–99% and membrane/insoluble Aβ levels by 83%–96%, while also decreasing brain cholesteryl-esters by 86%. Additionally, soluble Aβ42 was reduced by 34% in brain homogenates. Spatial learning was slightly improved and correlated with decreased Aβ levels. In nontransgenic littermates, CP-113,818 also reduced ectodomain shedding of endogenous APP in the brain. Our results suggest that ACAT inhibition may be effective in the prevention and treatment of AD by inhibiting generation of the Aβ peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2053929334,"We report that Id knockout mouse embryos display multiple cardiac defects, but mid-gestation lethality is rescued by the injection of 15 wild-type embryonic stem (ES) cells into mutant blastocysts. Myocardial markers altered in Id mutant cells are restored to normal throughout the chimeric myocardium. Intraperitoneal injection of ES cells into female mice before conception also partially rescues the cardiac phenotype with no incorporation of ES cells. Insulin-like growth factor 1, a long-range secreted factor, in combination with WNT5a, a locally secreted factor, likely account for complete reversion of the cardiac phenotype. Thus, ES cells have the potential to reverse congenital defects through Id-dependent local and long-range effects in a mammalian embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2025494340,"The functional receptor for the flavivirus West Nile (WNV) infection has been characterized in this study with a combination of biochemical and molecular approaches. A 105-kDa protease-sensitive glycoprotein that binds WNV was isolated from the plasma membrane of cells permissive to WNV infection. The protein was subjected to peptide sequencing, and this glycoprotein was identified as a member of the integrin superfamily. Infection of WNV was shown to be markedly inhibited in Vero cells pretreated with blocking antibodies against α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin and its subunits by receptor competition assay. It was also noted that cells pretreated with antibodies against α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin can effectively inhibit flavivirus Japanese encephalitis but to a lesser extent flavivirus dengue infections. West Nile virus entry is independent of divalent cations and is not highly blocked by arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptides, suggesting that the interaction between the virus and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin is not highly dependent on the classical RGD binding motif. In addition, gene silencing of the β<sub>3</sub> integrin subunit in cells has resulted in cells largely resistant to WNV infection. In contrast, expression of recombinant human β<sub>3</sub> integrin substantially increased the permissiveness of CS-1 melanoma cells for WNV infection. Soluble α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin can also effectively block WNV infection in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, WNV infection also triggered the outside-in signaling pathway via the activation of integrin-associated focal adhesion kinase. The identification of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin as a receptor for WNV provides insight into virus-receptor interaction, hence creating opportunities in the development of anti-viral strategies against WNV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2049494624,"We explored the relationship between regulation of the spine actin cytoskeleton, spine morphogenesis, and synapse formation by manipulating expression of the actin binding protein NrbI and its deletion mutants. In pyramidal neurons of cultured rat hippocampal slices, NrbI is concentrated in dendritic spines by binding to the actin cytoskeleton. Expression of one NrbI deletion mutant, containing the actin binding domain, dramatically increased the density and length of dendritic spines with synapses. This hyperspinogenesis was accompanied by enhanced actin polymerization and spine motility. Synaptic strengths were reduced to compensate for extra synapses, keeping total synaptic input per neuron constant. Our data support a model in which synapse formation is promoted by actin-powered motility."
https://openalex.org/W1995762174,"Melittin, a naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide, exhibits strong lytic activity against both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Despite a tremendous amount of work done, very little is known about the amino acid sequence, which regulates its toxic activity. With the goal of understanding the basis of toxic activity and poor cell selectivity in melittin, a leucine zipper motif has been identified. To evaluate the possible structural and functional roles of this motif, melittin and its two analogs, after substituting the heptadic leucine by alanine, were synthesized and characterized. Functional studies indicated that alanine substitution in the leucine zipper motif resulted in a drastic reduction of the hemolytic activity of melittin. However, interestingly, both the designed analogs exhibited antibacterial activity comparable to melittin. Mutations caused a significant decrease in the membrane permeability of melittin in zwitterionic but not in negatively charged lipid vesicles. Although both the analogs exhibited similar secondary structures in the presence of negatively charged lipid vesicles as melittin, they failed to adopt a significant helical structure in the presence of zwitterionic lipid vesicles. Results suggest that the substitution of heptadic leucine by alanine impaired the assembly of melittin in an aqueous environment and its localization only in zwitterionic but not in negatively charged membrane. Altogether, the results suggest the identification of a structural element in melittin, which probably plays a prominent role in regulating its toxicity but not antibacterial activity. The results indicate that cell selectivity in some antimicrobial peptides can probably be introduced by modulating their assembly in an aqueous environment.

The results indicate that cell selectivity in some antimicrobial peptides can probably be introduced by modulating their assembly in an aqueous environment. Melittin, the major component of European bee venom from Apis mellifera, is a well studied peptide, which is known for its strong cytolytic and antimicrobial activities (1Habermann E. Science. 1972; 177: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar, 2Dempsey C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). It belongs to the family of cytolytic peptides whose members are believed to be the key components of defense and offense mechanisms of all organisms (3Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6648) Google Scholar, 4Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar).A considerable number of structure-function studies have been carried out to understand the molecular mechanism of the hemolytic and antimicrobial activities of melittin. The replacement of the first 20 amino acids by another helix-forming sequence did not alter the antimicrobial and hemolytic activity of melittin (5DeGrado W.F. Kezdy F.J. Kaiser E.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 679-681Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the deletion of Leu-6, Lys-7, Val-8, Leu-9, Leu-13, Leu-16, Ile-17, Trp-19, and Ile-20 dramatically reduced the hemolytic activity of melittin and to a lesser extent the antimicrobial activity also (6Blondelle S.E. Houghten R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The crucial roles of both termini of melittin in its functional properties have been demonstrated by the design of several analogs with deletion of N-(7Habermann E. Kowallek H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z.

Experientia (Basel). 1971; 27: 764-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) sequences.Several efforts have been made to design analogs of melittin with decreased hemolytic but similar antimicrobial activity. For example, the diastereoisomers of melittin having d-amino acid analogs (10Oren Z. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1826-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) at a few positions, a hybrid peptide consisting of cecropin A and melittin sequences (11Boman H.G. Wade D. Bowman I.A. Wahlin B. Merrifield R.B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and an analog designed from the C-terminal 15-residue fragment (12Subbalakshmi C Nagaraj R Sitaram N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) exhibited similar antibacterial activity to melittin but much less hemolytic activity. The crystal structure of melittin has been solved, which indicated a tetrameric helix-bend-helix structure (13Terwilliger T.C. Eisenberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6016-6022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with two helical segments, positioned between amino acid residues 1–10 and 13–26 and the bend region within residues 11–12.Biophysical properties of melittin such as self-association and phospholipid membrane-interaction have been studied extensively to understand the mode of action of melittin (14Beschiaschvili G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Perez-Paya E. Houghten R.A. Blondelle S.E. J. Biol.

Although in water melittin exists as monomer with mostly random coil conformation, an increase in peptide concentration or the addition of salt results in the transformation of monomer to tetramer with a pronounced helical structure (18Talbot J.C. Dufourcq J. de Bony J. Faucon J.F. Lussan C. FEBS Letters. 1979; 102: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 19Tatham A.S. Hider R.C. Drake A.F. Biochem.

Melittin has been used as a model for studying the general features of lipid interaction of membrane proteins. Membrane-interaction studies suggest that melittin forms transmembrane pores in zwitterionic lipid bilayers by a barrel-stave mechanism (21Vogel H. Jahnig F. Biophys. J. 1986; 50: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 22Rex S. Schwarz G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2336-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Ladokhin A.S.

Toward the identification of important structural and functional elements in melittin and to gain insight about the regulation of cell selectivity in an antimicrobial peptide in general, we have found a leucine zipper motif, located within the residues 6–20, which has not been reported earlier to the best of our knowledge. Because this motif is known to play important roles in the assembly of DNA-binding proteins (26Lansschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15451-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it was of interest to look into the possible roles of this motif in the structural integrity and functional activity of melittin. For this purpose, two analogs of melittin were designed by selectively replacing heptadic leucine with single and double alanine and then synthesized. Hemolytic activity of single (MM-1) and double alanine mutants (MM-2) against human red blood cells was significantly less than that of melittin. Interestingly, MM-1 and MM-2 exhibited antibacterial activity comparable to melittin. Both of the designed analogs displayed contrasting membrane permeability in zwitterionic and negatively charged lipid vesicles. The results have been discussed in terms of the role of this motif in determining the hemolytic and antimicrobial activity of melittin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Rink amide 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (loading capacity, 0.63 mmol/g) and all the N-α Fmoc 1The abbreviations used are: Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; Chol, cholesterol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NBD, 4-fluoro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; RBC, red blood cell; hRBC, human RBC. and side-chain protected amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem, Switzerland.

Dry lipids were dissolved in CHCl3/MeOH (2:1 v/v) in small glass vial. Solvents were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen resulting the formation of a thin film on the wall of a glass vessel. The thin film was resuspended in a buffer at a concentration of 8.2 mg/ml by vortex mixing. The lipid dispersions were then sonicated in a bath-type sonicator (Laboratory Supplies Company, New York) for 10–20 min until it became transparent. The lipid concentration was determined by phosphorus estimation (37Bartlett G.R. J. Biol.

The samples were scanned at room temperature (∼30 °C) in a capped quartz cuvette of 0.20-cm path length in the wavelength range of 250–195 nm. The fractional helicities were calculated with the help of mean residue ellipticity values at 222 nm by the following equation (38Greenfield N. Fasman G.D.

The values for [θ]100222 and [θ]0222 that correspond to 100 and 0% helix contents were considered to have mean residue ellipticity values of –32,000 and –2000, respectively, at 222 nm (39Wu C.S.C.

Lipid vesicles, prepared in K+ buffer (50 mm K2SO4, 25 mm HEPES sulfate, pH 6.8), were mixed with isotonic (K+-free) Na+-buffer followed by the addition of the potential sensitive dye 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide. After the addition of valinomycin to the vesicle suspension when fluorescence of the dye exhibited a steady level, the respective peptide was added. The peptide-induced dissipation of diffusion potential, as detected by an increase in fluorescence (at 670 nm with excitation at 620 nm), was measured in terms of percentage of fluorescence recovery (Ft), defined by Ft = [(It – I0)/(If – I0)] × 100%, where It is fluorescence after the addition of a peptide at time t, I0 is fluorescence after the addition of valinomycin, and If is the total fluorescence observed before the addition of valinomycin.Enzymatic Cleavage Experiments—To detect the location of the peptides in their membrane-bound states, enzymatic cleavage experiments were performed with their NBD-labeled versions as reported earlier (30Ghosh J.K. Ovadia M. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15451-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Yadav S.P. Kundu B. Ghosh J.K. J. Biol.

In brief, lipid vesicles made of either PC/Chol, PC/PG/Chol, or PE/PG were first added to the NBD-labeled peptide. When all the peptide was bound to lipid as detected by the saturation of the fluorescence level, proteinase K (final concentration, 12.0 μg/ml) was added. In this experiment fluorescence of NBD-labeled peptide was recorded at 527 nm with respect to time (s) with excitation wavelength set at 467 nm.Hemolytic Activity Assay—The hemolytic activity of melittin and its analogs was assayed by a standard procedure (10Oren Z. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1826-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 12Subbalakshmi C Nagaraj R Sitaram N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In brief, fresh human red blood cells (hRBCs) that were collected in the presence of an anti-coagulant from a healthy volunteer were washed three times in PBS. Peptides, dissolved in water, were added to the suspension of red blood cells (6% final in v/v) in PBS to the final volume of 200 μl and incubated at 37 °C for 35 min. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm, and the release of hemoglobin was monitored by measuring the absorbance (Asample) of the supernatant at 540 nm. For negative and positive controls hRBCs in PBS (Ablank) and in 0.2% (final concentration v/v) Triton X-100 (ATriton) were used, respectively. The percentage of hemolysis was calculated according to the equation, Percentage of hemolysis = [(Asample – Ablank)/(ATriton – Ablank)] × 100.Assay of Antibacterial Activity of the Peptides—The antibacterial activity of the peptides was assayed in LB medium under aerobic conditions (10Oren Z. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1826-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 12Subbalakshmi C Nagaraj R Sitaram N.

A. 1994; 91: 2602-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Different concentrations of each of the peptides, dissolved in water, were added in duplicate to 100 μl (final volume) of medium containing the inocula of the test organism (∼106 colony forming units) in the midlogarithmic phase of growth. The inhibition of growth of microorganisms was assessed by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm after an incubation of 18–20 h at 37 °C. The antibacterial activity of the peptides was expressed as the minimal inhibitory concentration, the concentration at which 100% inhibition of microbial growth was observed after 18–20 h of incubation. The microorganisms used were Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli.RESULTSDesign of Analogs of Melittin—Melittin has an interesting sequence with 26 amino acids including five cationic residues. A leucine zipper motif, with every seventh amino acid as leucine/isoleucine (leucine at position 6 and 13 and isoleucine at position 20) and also leucine in two “d” positions, was identified (Fig. 1). To look into the possible role of this important structural motif, two analogs of melittin were designed. In one of which leucine at position 13 (MM-1) was replaced with alanine and in the other (MM-2) leucine at positions 6 and 13 were replaced with two alanines (Fig. 1A). Alanine was chosen for its helix propensity and similar hydrophobicity to leucine so that the amphipathic character of melittin was retained in MM-1 and MM-2.Mutation in the Leucine Zipper Motif Drastically Reduced the Hemolytic Activity of Melittin—To look into the role of the identified leucine zipper motif in the functional activities of melittin, hemolytic activity of melittin and its designed analogs were assayed. The substitution of leucine with alanine resulted in a drastic reduction of hemolytic activity of melittin against hRBCs (Fig. 2). MM-1 exhibited 10–20% hemolytic activity of melittin, whereas MM-2 showed ∼1–2% activity. The results indicated that the substitution of heptadic amino acids by alanine markedly inhibited the hemolytic activity of melittin probably suggesting a role of this motif in maintaining the lytic activity of the peptides toward the RBCs.Fig. 2Effect of mutation in the leucine zipper motif of melittin on its hemolytic activity.

Tetracycline was used as a positive control. In contrast to the hemolytic activity, the designed analogs of melittin (MM-1 and MM-2) exhibited very similar antibacterial activities to that of melittin (Table I). Thus the results clearly indicated that substitution of leucine by alanine in the heptadic positions did not affect the antibacterial activity of melittin unlike its hemolytic activity.Table IAntibacterial activity of melittin and its analogs against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteriaPeptide/antibiotic nameMinimal inhibitory concentrationE. coli DH5αB. subtilisS. aureusμmMelittin3.9 ± 0.62.0 ± 0.23.6 ± 0.5MM-14.5 ± 0.72.4 ± 0.34.3 ± 0.40MM-24.2 ± 0.71.8 ± 0.23.6 ± 0.6Tetracycline1.2 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.14.0 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Contrasting Difference in Membrane Permeability of the Designed Analogs of Melittin in Zwitterionic and Negatively Charged Membranes—The ability of melittin to destabilize the phospholipid bilayer is believed to be associated with its mechanism of action. Therefore, to understand the basis of the decreased hemolytic activity and almost unaltered antibacterial activity of the designed melittin analogs, the membrane permeability of melittin, MM-1, and MM-2 were examined by determining their efficacy to dissipate the diffusion potential across the phospholipid vesicles with different lipid composition. As shown in Fig. 3A, the membrane permeability (expressed as the percentage of fluorescence recovery) of MM-1 was significantly lower than melittin in zwitterionic PC/Chol vesicles, which decreased further with MM-2. However, interestingly, both MM-1 and MM-2 exhibited very similar membrane permeability to that of melittin in negatively charged PC/PG/Chol lipid vesicles (Fig. 3B). Experimental profiles for each of the peptides in both kinds of membranes are shown in the insets of Fig. 3, A and B. Moreover, the designed analogs induced membrane permeation as efficiently as melittin (not shown) in another kind of negatively charged membrane, namely PE/PG (7:3 w/w). The results indicated that although the substitution of leucine by alanine appreciably impaired the membrane permeability of melittin in the zwitterionic membrane, it had an almost negligible effect in negatively charged membrane.Fig. 3Membrane permeability induced by melittin and its analogs as plotted by percent fluorescence recovery induced by the individual peptides.

The corresponding mean residue ellipticity values of the individual peptides at 222 nm were used to determine their helical contents in a particular environment. Although all three peptides exhibited low helical structure in PBS (Fig. 4A), the extent of helicity was slightly more in melittin (∼15%) than MM-1 (∼8.5%) and MM-2 (∼6.5%). However, in the presence of increasing amount of negatively charged PC/PG/Chol lipid vesicles significant amount of helicity was induced in all three peptides as shown by a representative CD spectrum for each of these peptides with a fixed lipid/peptide molar ratio (∼32) (Fig. 4B). Melittin (69%), MM-1 (67.5%), and MM-2 (68.5%) exhibited very similar extents of helical structures indicating that the substitution of leucine by alanine did not affect the secondary structure of melittin in the presence of negatively charged lipid vesicles.Fig. 4Determination of secondary structures of melittin (15.2 μm), MM-1 (14.9 μm), and MM-2 (14.5 μm) in PBS (A), in the presence of 482 μm PC/PG/Chol (B), and 362 μm PC/Chol (C).

We studied translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) across a benzo[a]pyrene-guanine (BP-G) adduct, a major mutagenic DNA lesion generated by tobacco smoke. This was done using a quantitative assay that measures TLS indirectly, by measuring the recovery of gapped plasmids transfected into cultured mammalian cells. Analysis of PolK+/+ mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) showed that TLS across the BP-G adduct occurred with an efficiency of 48 ± 4%, which is an order of magnitude higher than in Escherichia coli. In PolK–/– MEFs, bypass was 16 ± 1%, suggesting that at least two-thirds of the BP-G adducts in MEFs were bypassed exclusively by polymerase κ (polκ). In contrast, polη was not required for bypass across BP-G in a human XP-V cell line. Analysis of misinsertion specificity across BP-G revealed that bypass was more error-prone in MEFs lacking polκ. Expression of polκ from a plasmid introduced into PolK–/– MEFs restored both the extent and fidelity of bypass across BP-G. Polκ was not required for bypass of a synthetic abasic site. In vitro analysis demonstrated efficient bypass across BP-G by both polκ and polη, suggesting that the biological role of polκ in TLS across BP-G is due to regulation of TLS and not due to an exclusive ability to bypass this lesion. These results indicate that BP-G is bypassed in mammalian cells with relatively high efficiency and that polκ bypasses BP-G in vivo with higher efficiency and higher accuracy than other DNA polymerases.

Genomic DNA is constantly subject to damage caused by both external agents, such as sunlight, and endogenous chemicals, such as reactive oxygen species. Most of this damage is eliminated by error-free DNA repair mechanisms, thereby restoring the DNA to its native sequence (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). However, a significant number of lesions escape repair and might therefore interfere with DNA replication and gene expression. Such interference can be mitigated by DNA damage tolerance mechanisms, primarily translesion DNA synthesis (TLS 1The abbreviations used are: TLS, translesion DNA synthesis; BP, benzo[a]pyrene; BPDE, benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide; BP-G, (+)-trans-benzo[a]pyrene-guanine adduct; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblasts; pol, DNA polymerase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.; also termed translesion replication) (2Goodman M.F.

However, there is a paucity of information about the efficiency and fidelity with which they support lesion bypass in living cells. Polη has a well established biological role in TLS, since it is mutated in all patients examined with the variant form of the hereditary disease xeroderma pigmentosum (10Johnson R.E. Kondratick C.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 285: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 18Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). This disease is characterized by sensitivity to sunlight and a marked predisposition to skin cancer. Correspondingly, cells from xeroderma pigmentosum patients are sensitive to and hypermutable by UV light (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Purified human polη replicates across TT cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers or normal TT sequences with similar efficiency and accuracy (19Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8355-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that in cells in which polη is inactivated, the bypass of these lesions is effected by other DNA polymerases with reduced efficiency (resulting in increased UV sensitivity) and reduced fidelity (resulting in hypermutability and skin cancer). Evidence for a function in TLS in vivo has also been provided for polζ and hREV1. In these cases, decreased expression of the relevant genes with antisense RNA led to reduced UV mutability (14Gibbs P.E. McGregor W.G. Maher V.M. Nisson P. Lawrence C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In vivo experiments showed that fibroblasts in culture, derived from PolK–/– mouse embryos, are sensitive to both killing and mutagenesis by BP, relative to otherwise isogenic cells from PolK+/+ mouse embryos, suggesting that polκ is involved in bypass across BP-G adducts in vivo (26Ogi T.

In this study, we used a quantitative indirect TLS assay to specifically analyze bypass across a site-specific BP-G adduct in mammalian cells. We found that 1) BP-G is bypassed in mammalian cells with a relatively high efficiency of 35–50%, an order of magnitude higher than in E. coli, 2) polκ is responsible for at least two-thirds of lesion bypass events, and 3) bypass by polκ occurs with lower mutagenicity than bypass by other DNA polymerases.

The BPDE-modified 54-mer oligonucleotides used to construct the gap-lesion plasmids GP-BPG1 and GP-BPG2 were the products of ligating the BPG1 and BPG2 12-mer oligonucleotides to two 21-mer oligonucleotides, using a 34-mer as a scaffold (Fig. 1A). The resulting 54-mers were separated from the scaffold and excess 21-mers on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (containing 8 m urea). The construction of the gap-lesion plasmids GP21 (with a synthetic abasic site) and GP20 (without a lesion; Fig. 1B) was previously described (29Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Tomer G. Livneh Z. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5948-5958Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The gap-lesion plasmids GP-BPG1 and GP-BPG2 were constructed similarly to GP21, except that the insert oligonucleotides contained the BPDE-modified 54-mer templates (Fig. 1B). The plasmid GP20-cm is a chloramphenicol-resistant derivative of GP20. This plasmid was prepared as GP20, except that the vector plasmid used was pSKSL-cm. Plasmid pSKSL-cm is the ligation product of the HindIII-XhoI fragment (2845 bp long) from plasmid pSKSL and a 773-bp fragment containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene from plasmid pACYC184 and carrying PCR-generated termini with XhoI and HindIII sites. The cDNA of the human DINB1 gene, encoding polκ, was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from HeLa cell total mRNA as three overlapping fragments using the following primers: for the 5′ portion of the DINB1 gene, primer 361 (5′-CGGATAAGTTTATACCATGGATAG-3′) and primer 362 (5′-GGCAATGCCTGCACTGGCTGTC-3′); for the middle portion of DINB1, primer 363 (5′-CTCAGTTGTTTTTGGAACATCAG-3′) and primer 364 (5′-AGAAACTCTTCTTATGAGACA-3′); for the 3′ portion of DINB1, primer 365 (5′-CCACTGAGTGTACATTAGAGAA-3′) and primer 366 (5′-TTAATGATAAAATGTTCAATGTTTAC-3′). The three amplified fragments were cleaved with restriction nucleases PflMI, XbaI plus PflMI, and XbaI, respectively, and then ligated. Finally, the full cDNA was amplified from the ligation mixture using primers 361 and 366 and cloned into the EcoRV site of plasmid pACYC184 to yield plasmid pACYC184-polκ. The sequence of the entire cloned DINB1 gene was then determined. The polκ expression vector, pC-polκ, was generated by PCR using pACYC184-polκ as a template, and the primers 5′-TTAGGATCCGGATAGCACAAGGAGAAGTGT-3′ and 5′-GTTCAATGTTTACTTAAACTCGAGATCAAGGGTATGTTTGGG-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and inserted into BamHI- and XhoI-cleaved pCDNA3 downstream to the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. The sequence of polκ open reading frame was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Cultures—Cells from Polκ-deficient and wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts were previously described (31Schenten D. Gerlach V.L. Guo C. Velasco-Miguel S. Hladik C.L. White C.L. Friedberg E.C. Rajewsky K. Esposito G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3152-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The SV40-transformed human fibroblasts, MRC5 (normal) and XP30RO (sv) (XPV; also designated GM3617 (32Cleaver J.E. Afzal V. Feeney L. McDowell M. Sadinski W. Volpe J.P. Busch D.B. Coleman D.M. Ziffer D.W. Yu Y. Nagasawa H. Little J.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1102-1108PubMed Google Scholar)) were gifts from A. R. Lehmann (University of Sussex, Brighton, UK). The human fibroblast cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium. The MEF cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine. Each medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Mammalian TLS Assay in Cultured Cells—The quantitative indirect TLS assay is a modification of the assay previously described (33Avkin S. Adar S. Blander G. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3764-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The original assay involved transient transfection of mammalian cells with a gap-lesion plasmid (kanR), along with a normalizing intact plasmid (cmR) and a carrier plasmid (ampR). A control transfection is performed in parallel with a gapped plasmid (kanR) without a lesion (modified base), along with the same normalizing intact plasmid (cmR) and carrier plasmid (ampR). After incubation of the transfected cells to allow TLS, the plasmid contents are extracted, and gapped plasmids that were not completely filled and ligated are denatured by alkaline lysis. The plasmid mixture is then transformed into an E. coli recA strain, and transformants are selected in parallel on LB-kan plates (to select for plasmids that underwent TLS) and LB-cm plates (to select for the normalizing plasmid). The extent of bypass is calculated by dividing the ratio of kanR/cmR transformants obtained with the gap-lesion plasmid mixture by the ratio of kanR/cmR transformants obtained with the gapped plasmid (with no lesion) mixture (33Avkin S. Adar S. Blander G. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3764-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the modified procedure, we replace the intact normalizing plasmid (cmR) by a gapped plasmid without a lesion (cmR), thereby simplifying the TLS assay. Mammalian cells are co-transfected with a plasmid mixture containing the gap-lesion plasmid (kanR), a control gapped plasmid without a lesion (cmR), and the carrier plasmid pUC18 (ampR). After allowing time for gap filling and lesion bypass, the plasmids were extracted from the cells using alkali, such that only filled in plasmids remained intact. To assay the fraction of filled in plasmids, the plasmid mixture was transformed into an indicator E. coli recA strain and plated in parallel, as in the original method, on LB-kan plates (to select for plasmids that underwent TLS) and LB-cm plates (to select for the control filled in plasmid GP20-cm) (Fig. 2). TLS in this case was calculated by the ratio of kanR/cmRE. coli transformants. The two methods yielded similar results. Specifically, the cells were co-transfected with a DNA mixture containing 50 ng of a gap-lesion plasmid (GP21, GP-BPG1, or GP-BPG2; kanR), 50 ng of a gapped plasmid without lesion (GP20-cm, cmR), and 10 μg of the carrier plasmid pUC18, using jetPEI/DNA complexes (34Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeniex D. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5654) Google Scholar). The percentage of lesion bypass gap filling was calculated by dividing the number of GP21*, 2The asterisks refer to the indicated plasmid after recovery from mammalian cells. GP-BPG1*, or GP-BPG2* transformants (number of colonies on LB-kan plates) by the number of corresponding GP20 cm* transformants (number of colonies on LB-cm plates). When desired, plasmids were extracted from kanR colonies, and the sequence opposite the lesion was determined by automated DNA sequencing analysis in the Biological Services Department in this Institute. In Vivo Complementation Assay—For the polκ complementation assay, the MEFs were co-transfected with a DNA mixture containing 1.5 μg of gap-lesion plasmid (GP-BPG1, kanR), 1.5 μg of gapped plasmid without lesion (GP20-cm, cmR), and 1 μg of expression vector (pC-polκ or the control pCDNA3). In this assay, the MEF cells were electroporated with Nucleofector™ (Amaxa GmbH, Köln, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. When desired, plasmids were extracted from kanR colonies, and the sequence opposite the lesion was determined by automated DNA sequencing analysis in the Biological Services Department in this institute. TLS Assay in E. coli—Gapped plasmids carrying the BP-G adduct (GP-BPG1 and BP-BPG2; kanR) and the control plasmid without the adduct (GP20; kanR) were used in parallel to transform UV-irradiated E. coli cells as previously described (8Berdichevsky A. Izhar L. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 917-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol.

A. 2003; 100: 14760-14765Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cells were UV-irradiated at 20 Jm–2, followed by a recovery period of 30 min at 37 °C, after which they were transformed in parallel with the gapped plasmids with and without the BP-G adduct using the Ca-MOPS method (8Berdichevsky A. Izhar L. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 917-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Survival was calculated by dividing the number of transformants obtained with the gap-lesion plasmid by the number of transformants obtained with the gapped plasmid without the lesion. In this assay, results from two parallel transformations are compared. Although no internal control is included, the same stock of competent cells was used for the gapped plasmids with and without the lesion, and the reliability of the results was assured by performing multiple experiments for each pair of gapped plasmid constructs. The bacterial strains used in this study were E. coli AB1157 (argE3, hisG4, leuB6, proA2, thr1, ara14, galK2, lacY1, mtl1, xyl5, thi1, tsx33, rpsL31, supE44) and E. coli RW118 (leuB+, araD139, sulA211, argE3, hisG4, leuB6, proA2, thr1, ara14, galK2, lacY1, mtl1, xyl5, thi1, tsx33, rpsL31, supE44), both proficient in TLS. In Vitro Lesion Bypass Assay—The DNA substrates used for this assay were prepared by annealing a 5′-32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide primer to the BPDE-modified 54-mer templates, followed by purification on a BioSpin 30 gel filtration column (Bio-Rad). Primer 5′-CTGGTTCAAGTAGCCAGGTAGGACG-3′ was used for the BP-G1-modified 54-mer, whereas primer 5′-CTGGTTCAAGTAGCCAGGTAGGA-3′ was used for the BP-G2 54-mer, both creating a substrate with the 3′ terminus located opposite the template base preceding the lesion. Analysis by electrophoresis on native gels revealed that >95% of the primers were annealed to the template oligonucleotides. All primer extension reactions contained 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 50 nm primer/template, and 25 nm DNA polymerase. Primer extension reaction carried out by E. coli polymerase I Klenow fragment also contained 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 4% glycerol. Primer extension reaction carried out by human DNA polymerase η, human DNA polymerase κ, or human DNA polymerase ι also contained 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. The primer extension reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 3–20 min. Reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of a mixture of 99.5% formamide, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol. Samples were fractionated by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea, after which they were dried, visualized, and quantified using a Fuji BAS 2500 phosphor imager. The extent of bypass was calculated by dividing the amount of bypass products by the amount of all extended primers. TLS across a Benzo[a]pyrene-guanine Adduct Is More Efficient in Mammalian Cells than in E. coli—The lesion bypass assay system used is a modified version of a previously described assay based on transfection of cells in culture with a gapped DNA plasmid carrying a site-specific lesion at a predetermined site and carrying an intact kan gene. Plasmids are recovered from cells and are introduced into E. coli recA cells for survival and mutational analysis (Fig. 2). Plasmids in which gaps are repaired by TLS in the mammalian cells give rise to colonies in E. coli (33Avkin S. Adar S. Blander G. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3764-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (also see “Discussion”). To quantify the results, a normalizing control gapped plasmid without the lesion and carrying a different antibiotics marker (cmR) was co-transfected along with the plasmid carrying the site-specific lesion. In addition, carrier DNA (pUC18, ampR) is included in the plasmid mixture. The ratio of kanR/cmR transformants represents the extent of gap filling and lesion bypass (Fig. 2; for details see “Experimental Procedures”). Therefore, the assay measures TLS indirectly via the recovery of gapped plasmids. We used gapped plasmids carrying site-specific BP-G adducts in order to study their bypass in mammalian cells. Two constructs were utilized, each containing the sequence GCGTCC derived from the p53 gene, carrying the lung cancer mutational hotspot codon 157 (underlined) (36Denissenko M.F. Pao A. Tang M.S. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1996; 274: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Plasmid GP-BPG1 (kanR), carries the sequence 5′-CATGCGTCCTAC-3′, whereas GP-BPG2 (kanR) carries the sequence 5′-CATGCGTCCTAC-3′ (the G is modified with BP). As shown in Table I (top), when the plasmids were alkali-treated and introduced into the E. coli tester strain without prior passage through the murine cells, TLS was very low (0.05–0.07%), representing the background in this system. When plasmid GP-BPG1 (kanR) was assayed in PolK+/+ cells, TLS was nearly 3 orders of magnitude above background, reaching an extent of 48 ± 4%. Similar results were obtained with plasmid GP-BPG2 (kanR) (52 ± 4%; Table I (top)). This extent of bypass is much higher than values usually reported for bypass across BP-G adducts in E. coli (37Hanrahan C.J. Bacolod M.D. Vyas R.R. Liu T. Geacintov N.E. Loechler E.L. Basu A.K. Chem.

However, since the differences might stem from DNA sequence context effects, which are known to strongly affect bypass across BP-G adducts in vitro and in E. coli in vivo (40Moriya M. Spiegel S.

As a control, the cells were transformed in parallel with the gapped plasmid without the lesion. TLS was calculated by the ratio of transformants obtained with the gap-lesion plasmids to the number of transformants obtained with the gapped plasmid without a lesion. As can be seen in Table I (bottom), bypass across the BP-G adduct was poor in E. coli, both with the GP-BPG1 (kanR) and GP-BPG2 (kanR) constructs, reaching 1.6% at most. SOS induction caused a slight increase in bypass, but even under these conditions bypass did not exceed 2%. Thus, bypass across the BP-G adduct was at least an order of magnitude more efficient in mice embryo fibroblasts than in E. coli.Table IExtent of bypass across BP-G adducts in mouse embryofibroblasts and in E. coli cellsMouse cellsGap-lesion plasmidE. coli transformantsaThe number of transformants obtained in a typical assay with 100 μl of the transformation mixture.

https://openalex.org/W2130232797,"After opening in response to mechanical stimuli, hair cell transduction channels adapt with fast and slow mechanisms that each depend on Ca2+. We demonstrate here that transduction and adaptation require phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) for normal kinetics. PIP2 has a striking distribution in hair cells, being excluded from the basal region of hair bundles and apical surfaces of frog saccular hair cells. Localization of a phosphatidylinositol lipid phosphatase, Ptprq, to these PIP2-free domains suggests that Ptprq maintains low PIP2 levels there. Depletion of PIP2 by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase or sequestration by aminoglycosides reduces the rates of fast and slow adaptation. PIP2 and other anionic phospholipids bind directly to the IQ domains of myosin-1c, the motor that mediates slow adaptation, permitting a strong interaction with membranes and likely regulating the motor's activity. PIP2 depletion also causes a loss in transduction current. PIP2 therefore plays an essential role in hair cell adaptation and transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2055697700,"The transcriptional coactivator lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 acts as a chromatin tethering factor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase protein, determining its nuclear localization and its tight association with nuclear DNA. Here we identify a second function for the LEDGF/p75-integrase interaction. We observed that stable introduction of HIV-1 integrase (IN) transcription units into cells made stringently LEDGF/p75-deficient by RNAi resulted in much lower steady state levels of IN protein than introduction into LEDGF/p75 wild type cells. The same LEDGF/p75-dependent disparity was observed for feline immunodeficiency virus IN. However, IN mRNA levels were equivalent in the presence and absence of LEDGF/p75. A post-translational mechanism was confirmed when the half-life of HIV-1 IN protein was found to be much shorter in LEDGF/p75-deficient cells. Proteasome inhibition fully countered this extreme instability, increasing IN protein levels to those seen in LEDGF/p75 wild type cells and implicating proteasomal destruction as the main cause of IN instability. Consistent with these data, increased ubiquitinated HIV-1 IN was found in the LEDGF/p75 knock-down cells. Moreover, restoration of LEDGF/p75 to knocked down clones rescued HIV-1 IN stability. Subcellular fractionation showed that HIV-1 IN is exclusively cytoplasmic in LEDGF/p75-deficient cells, but mainly nuclear in LEDGF/p75 wild type cells, and that cytoplasmic HIV-1 IN has a shorter half-life than nuclear HIV-1 IN. However, using LEDGF proteins defective for nuclear localization and IN interaction, we further determined that protection of HIV-1 IN from the proteasome requires neither chromatin tethering nor nuclear residence. Protection requires only interaction with LEDGF/p75, and it is independent of the subcellular localization of the IN-LEDGF complex."
https://openalex.org/W2016655414,"Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is considered a critical, early event in the induction of an apoptosis cascade that ultimately leads to programmed cell death. Mitochondrial Ca2+ loading is a trigger for the release of cytochrome c, although the molecular mechanism underlying this effect is not fully clarified. This study tested the hypothesis that distinct Ca2+ thresholds may induce cytochrome c release from rat liver mitochondria by membrane permeability transition (MPT)-dependent and independent mechanisms. The involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cardiolipin in the Ca2+-induced cytochrome c release was also investigated. Cytochrome c was quantitated by a new, very sensitive, and rapid reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography method with a detection limit of 0.1 pmol/sample. We found that a low extramitochondrial Ca2+ level (2 μm) promoted the release of ∼13% of the total alamethicin releasable pool of cytochrome c from mitochondria. This release was not depending of MPT; it was mediated by Ca2+-induced ROS production and cardiolipin peroxidation and appears to involve the voltage-dependent anion channel. High extramitochondrial Ca2+ level (20 μm) promoted ∼45% of the total releasable pool of cytochrome c. This process was MPT-dependent and was also mediated by ROS and cardiolipin. It is suggested that distinct Ca2+ levels may determine the mode and the amount of cytochrome c release from rat liver mitochondria.

Pore transition results in a dramatic drop in the mitochondrial transmembrane electrical potential (ΔΨ), osmotic swelling of the mitochondrial matrix, rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and the release of cytochrome c. Relatively high levels of extramitochondrial added Ca2+are required to achieve this effect, and different mechanisms selective for brain versus liver have been suggested (13Andreyev A. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although MPT induction was originally considered the basic mechanism responsible for cytochrome c release from mitochondria in response to Ca2+ accumulation, more recent studies suggest that Ca2+-induced cytochrome c release may occur in an MPT-independent manner (14Schild L.

Low extramitochondrial Ca2+ level can induce cytochrome c release from brain mitochondria without apparent MPT opening, mitochondrial swelling, and rupture of the outer membrane (14Schild L.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, a relatively low level of added Ca2+ to rat liver mitochondria is sufficient to induce cytochrome c release without any observable large amplitude swelling or drop in membrane potential (15Gogvadze V.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 18Fleury C. Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.L. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 84: 131-141Crossref Scopus (880) Google Scholar). ROS can produce an oxidative stress leading to cell destruction as observed during necrosis. In several instances, ROS derived from mitochondria are also involved in the initiation phase of apoptosis contributing to cell death signaling. The involvement of ROS in cytochrome c release from mitochondria is well established. However, the exact mechanism by which ROS promote cytochrome c release from mitochondria and subsequent apoptosis process remains unclear. Cardiolipin, a phospholipid almost exclusively located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, has been emerging as an important player in the control of the mitochondrial phase of the apoptotic process (19Ostrander D.B.

Cardiolipin at the contact sites has been claimed to provide specificity for targeting of tBid to the mitochondria (23Lutter M. Fang M. Luo X. Nishijima M. Xie X. Wang X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 24Kim T.H. Zhao Y. Ding W.X. Shin J.N. He X. Seo Y.W. Chen J. Rabinowich H. Amoscato A.A. Yin X.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3061-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in controlling many mitochondrial processes such as the activity of respiratory chain complexes and anion carriers (for review see Ref. 25Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), cardiolipin molecules bind cytochrome c to the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane (26Soussi B. Bylund-Fellenius A.C. Schersten T. Angstrom J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Touminen E.K. Wallace C.J. Kinnunen P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8822-8826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, conditions leading to alteration of this binding, such as changes in the cardiolipin content and/or oxidative damage to its unsaturated acyl chains (28Shidoji Y. Hayashi K. Komura T. Kobayashi T. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 29Nomura K. Imai H. Koumura T. Kobayashi T. Nakagawa Y. Biochem.

Biophys. 2004; 423: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) should promote cytochrome c detachment from the mitochondrial membrane, which can be considered an initial step in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Accordingly, we have proposed that mitochondrial-mediated ROS production promotes cytochrome c release from mitochondria by a two-step process consisting of the dissociation of this protein from cardiolipin, caused by alteration of the interaction between this phospholipid and cytochrome c, followed by permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane probably by interaction with VDAC (32Petrosillo G. Ruggiero F.M. Paradies G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2202-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Recent studies reported that Ca2+ accumulation by mitochondria is associated to stimulation of mitochondrial ROS production (33Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C141-C147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 35Starkov A.A.

Res. 2004; 38: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) by a mechanism not well understood. On the basis of the observations reported above, it is conceivable that Ca2+, ROS, and cardiolipin might play a coordinated role in the mechanism of cytochrome c release from mitochondria and subsequent apoptosis. These aspects were explored in the present investigation. This work describes the effects of relatively low and relatively high extramitochondrial Ca2+ levels added to rat liver mitochondria on various bioenergetic parameters such as cytochrome c release, ROS production, membrane potential, and mitochondrial swelling as well as on the cardiolipin level and its degree of peroxidation. We found that low (2 μm) and high (20 μm) Ca2+ levels promote cytochrome c release from rat liver mitochondria by a mechanism that is MPT-independent and MPT-dependent, respectively. These effects of Ca2+ are mediated by ROS and cardiolipin. Reagents—Safranin O, scopoletin, and horseradish peroxidase were from Sigma. Dichlorofluorescein was from Fluka. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Anti-VDAC antibody was from Calbiochem. Preparation of Mitochondria—Rat liver mitochondria were isolated in ice-cold medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, by differential centrifugation of liver homogenates essentially as described previously (32Petrosillo G. Ruggiero F.M. Paradies G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2202-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and stored in ice. Mitochondrial protein concentration was measured by the biuret method using serum albumin as standard. Standard Incubation Procedure—Mitochondria (0.5 mg protein/3 ml) were incubated at 25 °C in a medium containing 150 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.25 mm Pi, 10 μm EGTA, and 1 μm rotenone. Extramitochondrial Ca2+ was adjusted by using Ca2+/EGTA buffer. For calculation the concentration of free Ca2+ we used the complexing constants according to Ref. 37Thomas W.E. Crespo-Armas A. Mowbray J. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar. Fluorometric Determination of Mitochondrial H2O2 Production—The rate of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production was estimated by measuring the linear fluorescence increase induced by H2O2 oxidation of dichlorofluorescein to the fluorescent dichlorofluorescein in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (38Black M.J. Brandt R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was determined at 488 nm for excitation and 525 nm for emission. Rat liver mitochondria (0.5 mg of protein) were suspended in 3 ml of the standard incubation medium supplemented with 1.5 μm rotenone, 5 mm succinate, 7.5 μg of horseradish peroxidase, and 1 μm dichlorofluorescein. The production of hydrogen peroxide was induced by the addition of Ca2+. The amount of H2O2 produced was calculated by measuring the fluorescence changes induced by the addition of known amounts of H2O2 H2O2 production was also measured by the scopoletin method. The results were practically similar to those obtained with the dichlorofluorescein method. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—The membrane potential of intact liver mitochondria was measured following the safranin O fluorescence quenching at 525 nm (excitation), 575 nm (emission) with a Jasco FP-750 spectrofluorometer (39Kaupinen R.A. Hassinen I.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: H508-H516PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly isolated mitochondria (0.5 mg of protein) were suspended in 3 ml of the standard incubation medium supplemented with 1.5 μm rotenone and 8 μm safranin O. The generation of the transmembrane potential was induced by the addition of 5 mm succinate as substrate. Detection of Cytochrome c Release—Cytochrome c content, in the supernatant, was determined by using a 5-mm C4 reverse-phase column (150 × 4.6 mm) on a Hewlett Packard series 1100 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatograph. A gradient of 20% acetonitrile in water with trifluoroacetic acid (0.1% v/v) to 60% acetonitrile in water with trifluoroacetic acid (0.1% v/v) over 12 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min was used. Absorption at 393 nm was used (40Piklo M. Zhang J. Nguyen V.Q. Graham D. Montine T.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 276: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To improve the sensitivity of the method, the supernatants were supplemented with bovine serum albumin to a final concentration of 25 μm (41Crouser E.D. Gadd M.E. Julian M.W. Huff J.E. Broekemeier K.M. Robbins K.A. Pfeiffer D.R. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 317: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Analysis of Cardiolipin in Mitochondrial Membranes—Cardiolipin was analyzed by HPLC using a Hewlett Packard series 1100 gradient liquid chromatograph. Lipids from heart mitochondria were extracted with chloroform/methanol by the procedure of Bligh and Dyer (42Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Lipid extraction was carried out on ice immediate after the preparation of mitochondria in the presence of butylated hydroxytoluene and under a nitrogen atmosphere. Phospholipids were separated by the HPLC method previously described (43Ruggiero F.M. Landriscina C. Gnoni G.V. Quagliariello E. Lipids. 1984; 19: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with a Lichrosorb Si60 column (4.6 × 250 mm). The chromatographic system was programmed for gradient elution using two mobile phases: solvent A, hexane/2-propanol (6:8, v/v) and solvent B, hexane/2-propanol/water (6:8:1.4, v/v/v). The percentage of solvent B in solvent A was increased in 15 min from 0–100%. Flow rate was 1 ml/min and detection was determined at 206 nm. The peak of cardiolipin was identified by comparison with the retention time of standard cardiolipin and rechromatographed by TLC. Analysis of Peroxidized Cardiolipin—Peroxidized cardiolipin was identified by normal-phase HPLC as described above with UV detection at 235 nm, indicative of conjugated dienes (44Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1959; 52: 302-310Crossref Scopus (10916) Google Scholar, 45Ott M. Robertson V. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovski B. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 46Paradies, G., Petrosillo, G., Pistolese, M., Di Venosa, N., Federici, A., and Ruggiero, F. M. Circ. Res. 94, 53–59Google Scholar). The resulting peak was rechromatographed by TLC and used as standard. Mitochondrial Swelling—To measure mitochondrial swelling that accompanies the opening of the permeability transition pore mitochondria (0.5 mg of protein/3 ml) were suspended in the standard incubation medium supplemented with 1.5 μm rotenone and 5 mm succinate. The mitochondrial swelling was monitored continuously at 540 nm. Most of the published data concerning cytochrome c release from mitochondria have been obtained from Western blotting or absorbance spectroscopy. In particular, Western blotting is a semiquantitative method that cannot give precise information about the amount of cytochrome c released. For direct evaluation of Ca2+-induced cytochrome c release from isolated liver mitochondria, extramitochondrial cytochrome c was analyzed by a new, very rapid, and sensitive method based on reverse-phase HPLC. This method first introduced by Piklo et al. (40Piklo M. Zhang J. Nguyen V.Q. Graham D. Montine T.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 276: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and improved by Crouser et al. (41Crouser E.D. Gadd M.E. Julian M.W. Huff J.E. Broekemeier K.M. Robbins K.A. Pfeiffer D.R. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 317: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) allowed us to quantitate cytochrome c with a detection limit around 0.1 pmol/sample. The release of cytochrome c was measured in mitochondria supplemented with the oxidizable substrate succinate in the presence of rotenone after the addition of relatively low and relatively high concentrations of added Ca2+. The mitochondrial cytochrome c content as quantified by this technique was 160 ± 14 pmol/mg protein, in line with the results reported by others (41Crouser E.D. Gadd M.E. Julian M.W. Huff J.E. Broekemeier K.M. Robbins K.A. Pfeiffer D.R. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 317: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The addition to mitochondria of alamethicin, an artificial channel former, induced the release of 121 ± 13 pmol cytochrome c/mg protein, which corresponds to 70% of the total amount of mitochondrial cytochrome c. The amount of cytochrome c released upon treatment with alamethicin was taken as the maximal amount of this hemoprotein that could be released by mitochondria under our experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 1, in the absence of added Ca2+ no detectable amount of cytochrome c was liberated from control mitochondria during 10 min of incubation, which indicates the integrity of our mitochondrial preparation. However, the addition of 2 μm Ca2+ (12 nmol/mg protein) or 20 μm (120 nmol/mg protein) induced the release of 15 ± 1.5 or 54 ± 6 pmol of cytochrome c/mg protein, respectively. Complete prevention of Ca2+ influx into the mitochondrial matrix by inhibition of Ca2+ uniporter by ruthenium red totally abolished the Ca2+-induced cytochrome c release, indicating that Ca2+ accumulation inside mitochondria is needed for this effect. The effect of cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition, was tested on the release of cytochrome c induced by these two Ca2+ levels. Cyclosporin A did not prevent the release of cytochrome c induced by low [Ca2+], while it inhibited the extraquote of cytochrome c release induced by high [Ca2+]. Pretreatment of the isolated mitochondria with an anti-VDAC antibody (47Shimizu S. Matsuoka Y. Shinohara Y. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) prevented the release of cytochrome c induced by a low Ca2+ level. To ascertain the possible involvement of MPT in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in the presence of added Ca2+, experiments were carried out recording the changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 2). Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) was generated by the addition of succinate as substrate in the presence of rotenone (trace a). The addition of low [Ca2+] to mitochondria resulted in a transient reduction in ΔΨ (trace b) as Ca2+ uptake occurs via an electrophoretic uniporter that draws upon the ΔΨ for active Ca2+ accumulation. Approximately 1 min after the addition of Ca2+, ΔΨ recovered back to its control level and remained stable for at least 10 min. The addition of ruthenium red (RR) totally abolished the Ca2+-induced transient reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane ΔΨ (trace c). By contrast, the anti-VDAC antibody had no effect on this ΔΨ decrease (trace d) indicating that this compound did not affect Ca2+ accumulation by mitochondria. As expected, the succinate-induced polarization was rapidly and totally abolished by the addition of high [Ca2+] (trace e). This effect was abolished by the Ca2+ uniporter inhibitor RR (trace f) or by cyclosporin A, a known inhibitor of the Ca2+-induced pore opening (trace g). These results indicate that two distinct Ca2+ thresholds can determine the closed or unclosed state of the permeability transition pore in rat liver mitochondria. This conclusion is further supported by experiments in which mitochondrial volume changes were measured. As reported in Fig. 3 the addition of low Ca2+ to rat liver mitochondria did not cause any appreciable decrease of light scattering during the first 10 min of incubation, indicating the absence of pore opening. By contrast, the addition of high Ca2+ resulted in a rapid and full activation of MPT, which was abolished by cyclosporin A. It has been reported that Ca2+ loading by mitochondria results in a stimulation of H2O2 production (33Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C141-C147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 35Starkov A.A. Polster B.M. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 36Kanno T. Sato E.F. Muranaka S. Fujita H. Fujiwara T. Utsumi T. Inoue M. Utsumi K. Free Radic. Res. 2004; 38: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), although the mechanism responsible for this stimulation remains unclear. Fig. 4 shows the production of H2O2 in mitochondria supplemented with the oxidizable substrate succinate in the presence of rotenone after the addition of low or high levels of Ca2+. The addition of free Ca2+ at 2 μm resulted in a stimulation of H2O2 generation (trace b). This H2O2 production was more pronounced when 20 μm free Ca2+ was added (trace c). Complete prevention of Ca2+ influx into the mitochondrial matrix by inhibition of uniporter by ruthenium red almost completely abolished the Ca2+-induced H2O2 production (trace d), confirming the requirement of Ca2+ entry into mitochondria for this effect. The stimulation of H2O2 production induced by low [Ca2+] was not inhibited by cyclosporin A (trace e), indicating that MPT is not involved in this process nor by anti-VDAC antibody (trace f). The stimulation of H2O2 production in the presence of high [Ca2+] was largely reduced by cyclosporin A (trace g) suggesting the possible involvement of MPT in this process. Cytochrome c is bound to cardiolipin at the level of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The molecular interaction between cytochrome c and cardiolipin has been extensively studied (26Soussi B. Bylund-Fellenius A.C. Schersten T. Angstrom J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Touminen E.K. Wallace C.J. Kinnunen P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8822-8826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that mitochondrial ROS production is associated to cardiolipin oxidative damage and cytochrome c release from mitochondria (30Petrosillo G. Ruggiero F.M. Pistolese M. Paradies G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 32Petrosillo G. Ruggiero F.M. Paradies G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2202-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The content of cardiolipin was measured in mitochondria in the presence of low and high Ca2+ concentrations by a very sensitive HPLC technique set up in our laboratory with a detection limit of 0.5 nmol (43Ruggiero F.M. Landriscina C. Gnoni G.V. Quagliariello E. Lipids. 1984; 19: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, addition of low [Ca2+] to mitochondria resulted in a loss of cardiolipin content compared with control mitochondria. This loss of cardiolipin was more pronounced in the presence of high [Ca2+]. The addition of RR prevented the loss of cardiolipin induced by low and high Ca2+ concentrations. Pretreatment of the isolated mitochondria with an anti-VDAC antibody had no effect on the cardiolipin loss induced by low [Ca2+] (results not shown). The loss in the cardiolipin content observed in mitochondria following Ca2+ accumulation could be caused by cardiolipin peroxidation because of ROS attack to its unsaturated acyl chains. To asses this, the content of peroxidized cardiolipin was measured in mitochondria by an HPLC method based on the absorbance at 235 nm, indicative of the formation of conjugated dienes (45Ott M. Robertson V. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovski B. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 46Paradies, G., Petrosillo, G., Pistolese, M., Di Venosa, N., Federici, A., and Ruggiero, F. M. Circ. Res. 94, 53–59Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, an increase in the level of peroxidized cardiolipin was observed in mitochondria in the presence of low [Ca2+] compared with control mitochondria. A more pronounced level of peroxidized cardiolipin was detected when a high level of [Ca2+] was added to mitochondria. Ruthenium red prevented the Ca2+-induced increase in cardiolipin peroxidation. A number of studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial Ca2+ loading contributes to the induction of molecular cell death cascades in several different paradigms (7Hajnoczky G. Davies E. Madesh M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 8Szabadkai G. Rizzuto R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Gunter T.E. Yule D.I. Gunter K.K. Eliseev R.A. Salter J.D. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 48Ermak G. Davies K.J.A. Mol. Immunol. 2001; 38: 713-721Crossref Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Ca2+-induced release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol is an early and key step linking the triggering phase of apoptosis to the executioning phase. Two main hypotheses concerning the mechanism of Ca2+-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria have been suggested. One involves the activation of MPT by Ca2+ and mitochondrial depolarization and swelling followed by the rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane causing cytochrome c release (10Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 11Crompton M. Barksby E. Johnson N. Capano M. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 83: 143-152Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 12Halestrap A.P. Doran E. Gillespie J.P. O'Toole A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 49Halestrap A.P. Kerr P.M. Javadov S. Woodfield K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 50Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar). The second hypothesis, obtained mainly with brain mitochondria, suggests that a distinct threshold of extramitochondrial Ca2+ in low micromolar range is sufficient to mediate the release of cytochrome c independent of MPT without mitochondrial swelling or outer membrane rupture (14Schild L. Keilhoff G. Augustin W. Reiser G. Striggow F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 565-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Evidence for cytochrome c release at low Ca2+ levels in rat liver mitochondria in the absence of observable manifestation of MPT was already presented. This effect was explained on the basis that low Ca2+ loading is sufficient to induce MPT in a subpopulation of mitochondria (15Gogvadze V. Robertson J.D. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19066-19071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We have investigated the effect of low Ca2+ on cytochrome c release from rat liver mitochondria using a new, very sensitive, and rapid reverse HPLC method with a detection limit of 0.1 pmol. We found that extramitochondrial Ca2+ level as low as 2 μm (12 nmol/mg protein) promoted the release of ∼13% of the total alamethicin-releasable pool of cytochrome c from mitochondria. This release was not inhibited by cyclosporin A. In addition, no change in the membrane potential nor in the mitochondrial swelling was observed following incubation of mitochondria for 10 min in the presence of low [Ca2+] (a condition under which cytochrome c was observed), thus excluding the involvement of the MPT in this process. These results indicate that the integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix space was preserved following low [Ca2+] addition to mitochondria. By contrast, when a high Ca2+ level (20 μm) was added to mitochondria, a substantial amount of cytochrome c (∼45% of the maximal releasable amount) was released. This release was inhibited by cyclosporin A indicating activation of MPT in this process as further documented by classical membrane depolarization and swelling experiments (Figs. 3 and 4). Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria appears to be largely mediated by ROS. However the exact mechanism by which ROS induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria and subsequent apoptosis is still not well understood. Recent findings have shown that Ca2+ overload is accompanied by ROS production (33Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C141-C147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 35Starkov A.A. Polster B.M. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 36Kanno T. Sato E.F. Muranaka S. Fujita H. Fujiwara T. Utsumi T. Inoue M. Utsumi K. Free Radic. Res. 2004; 38: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We have confirmed these results showing that addition of micromolar Ca2+ level to rat liver mitochondria in the presence of rotenone and oxidizable substrate succinate induces a stimulation of ROS production (Fig. 4). This stimulation was dose-dependent and was completely abolished by ruthenium red, a known inhibitor of the Ca2+ influx into the mitochondria. This indicates that Ca2+-induced ROS production depends on Ca2+ accumulation into the mitochondrial matrix. The mechanism by which Ca2+ accumulation promotes ROS generation is unclear. One possible explanation is that by binding to cardiolipin molecules Ca2+ may impair the flow of electrons within the electron transport chain at the site, most likely within complex III, which is proximal to the site of ROS generation (51Grijalba M.T. Vercesi A.E. Schreier S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13279-13287Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been reported that complex III contains tightly bound cardiolipin molecules that appear to be essential for the catalytic function (52Gomez Jr., B Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9031-9038Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 53Lange C. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The involvement of cardiolipin in the function of complex III is also supported by the results of our recent study showing inactivation of this enzyme complex by nonyl-l-acridine, a compound that interacts specifically with cardiolipin (54Paradies G. Petrosillo G. Pistolese M. Ruggiero F.M. Mitochondrion. 2001; 1: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because Ca2+ accumulation by mitochondria stimulates ROS generation and given that these species are highly reactive and short lived, mitochondrial constituents might be exposed to oxidative stress. Among mitochondrial constituents, cardiolipin appears particularly susceptible to ROS attack either because of its high content of unsaturated fatty acids (90% represented by linoleic acid) or because of its location in the inner mitochondrial membrane, near to the site of ROS production. We found that the addition of low [Ca2+] to mitochondria is associated with a decrease in the mitochondrial cardiolipin content (Fig. 5), caused by ROS-induced cardiolipin peroxidation and shown by the increased level of conjugated dienes (Fig. 6). These effects were totally abolished by ruthenium red. The fact that ruthenium red prevents Ca2+-induced cytochrome c release, ROS production, and cardiolipin peroxidation indicates that all these processes are caused by Ca2+ accumulation inside mitochondria. Furthermore, the existence of a good quantitative correlation among these processes suggests a possible causal link among them. Taken together, our results indicate that addition of low [Ca2+] to rat liver mitochondria promotes a cascade of events consisting of ROS production, leading to oxidative damage to cardiolipin with subsequent detachment of cytochrome c from the inner mitochondrial membrane, and then releasing cytochrome c through the outer mitochondrial membrane. As discussed above, this Ca2+-induced cytochrome c release is independent of MPT. How might Ca2+ induce cytochrome c release in the absence of MPT? Recently, we reported (confirming previous results in the literature (17Madesh M. Hainoczky G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar)) that reactive oxygen species produced by the mitochondrial respiratory chain induce MPT-independent cytochrome c release by selective permeabilization of outer mitochondrial membrane through interaction with VDAC (32Petrosillo G. Ruggiero F.M. Paradies G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2202-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 55Colell A. Garcia-Ruiz C. Mari M. Fernandez-Checa J.C. FEBS Lett. 5. 2004; 60: 63-68Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fact that cytochrome c release induced by low [Ca2+] is inhibited by an anti-VDAC antibody supports the possibility that a similar mechanism might be involved in the cytochrome c release induced by low [Ca2+]. At a relatively high Ca2+ level, the mechanism of cytochrome c release would involve ROS production leading to cardiolipin peroxidation with subsequent detachment of cytochrome c from inner mitochondrial membrane followed by ROS-dependent MPT opening. In fact, it has been reported that ROS and high intra-mitochondrial Ca2+ may act together to trigger MPT opening, probably by oxidizing critical thiol groups of adenine nucleotide translocase, a known reported constituent of the pore (36Kanno T. Sato E.F. Muranaka S. Fujita H. Fujiwara T. Utsumi T. Inoue M. Utsumi K. Free Radic. Res. 2004; 38: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The possibility that ROS and Ca2+ could interact with cardiolipin molecules tightly bound to adenine nucleotide translocase inducing conformational change to this protein, thus causing MPT opening, should also be taken into consideration. Permanent MPT opening causes cytochrome c release via matrix swelling and rupture of the mitochondrial membrane. In summary, our data indicate that an increase in mitochondrial [Ca2+] loading into micromolar range is sufficient to promote cytochrome c release from rat liver mitochondria without opening of MPT. This effect of Ca2+ is mediated by ROS inducing cardiolipin peroxidation, cytochrome c detachment from inner mitochondrial membrane and outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization through VDAC. Relatively high micromolar Ca2+ level is required to open MPT to release a substantial amount of cytochrome c. This effect is also mediated by ROS generation and cardiolipin peroxidation. Ca2+ overload has been suggested to be the final common pathway of all types of cell death. The low and high [Ca2+]-dependent mechanisms of cytochrome c release from rat liver mitochondria mediated by ROS and cardiolipin might reflect two distinct physiopathological situations. Under a pathological condition, such as during ischemia-reperfusion injury, high mitochondrial Ca2+ loading could promote cell death through necrosis, whereas lower Ca2+ loading induced by milder insults could promote cell death through apoptosis."

Recent evidence indicates that caspase-2 is activated early in response to genotoxic stress and can function as an upstream modulator of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In particular, we have shown previously that fully processed caspase-2 can permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane and cause cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release from these organelles. Using permeabilized cells, isolated mitochondria, and protein-free liposomes, we now report that this effect is direct and depends neither on the presence or cleavage of other proteins nor on a specific phospholipid composition of the liposomal membrane. Interestingly, caspase-2 was also shown to disrupt the interaction of cytochrome c with anionic phospholipids, notably cardiolipin, and thereby enhance the release of the hemoprotein caused by treatment of mitochondria with digitonin or the proapoptotic protein Bax. Combined, our data suggest that caspase-2 possesses an unparalleled ability to engage the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by permeabilizing the outer mitochondrial membrane and/or by breaching the association of cytochrome c with the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Combined, our data suggest that caspase-2 possesses an unparalleled ability to engage the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by permeabilizing the outer mitochondrial membrane and/or by breaching the association of cytochrome c with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Apoptosis is executed by a family of cysteine proteases known as caspases. In vertebrates, these enzymes are present constitutively as zymogens and become activated in response to numerous apoptotic stimuli (1Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 855-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Once activated, caspases cleave proteins after aspartate residues and thereby bring about many of the biochemical and morphological features characteristic of apoptosis. Of the two primary caspase activation pathways (death receptor-mediated and mitochondrially mediated), the mitochondrial pathway is most commonly associated with apoptosis triggered by cytotoxic stress and involves the activation of caspase-9 within the Apaf-1-containing apoptosome complex (2Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Until recently, the dominant viewpoint has been that caspase-9 activation represents the apex of the caspase cascade during stress-induced apoptosis. However, this hypothesis is currently being challenged by evidence suggesting that caspase-2 may be critical for the engagement of the mitochondrial pathway, and hence caspase-9 activation, during DNA damage-induced apoptosis (3Robertson J.D.

Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), the role of caspase-2 in apoptotic cell death remains contentious. Like caspase-9 it contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), but recent evidence indicates that caspase-2 activation occurs in an Apaf-1-independent complex, which also includes the death domain (DD)-containing protein PIDD and the adaptor protein RAIDD (9Read S.H.

Additional findings have shown that caspase-2 retains a unique ability to engage directly the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (4Robertson J.D. Enoksson M. Suomela M. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J.

The aim of the current study was to determine more precisely the molecular requirements for caspase-2-mediated engagement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The results indicate that processed recombinant human caspase-2 triggers a rapid and concentration-dependent release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria as well as liposomes. This occurs independently of other proteins and does not require a specific phospholipid profile within liposomes. In addition, our results demonstrate that caspase-2 has the capacity to detach cytochrome c from the inner mitochondrial membrane by compromising its association with anionic phospholipids. Expression and Purification of Caspase-2 Proteins—Bacterial expression plasmids containing active, catalytically inactive (C303A) (11Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A. Fernandes-Alnemri T.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—Active caspase-2 was used as a template to introduce a D316G point mutation using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis. Cell Culture—Jurkat T-lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2% (w/v) glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified air/CO2 (19:1) atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were maintained in a logarithmic growth phase for all experiments. Digitonin-permeabilized Cells—Jurkat T-lymphocytes (106) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 100 μl KCl-sucrose buffer (140 mm mannitol, 46 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm succinate, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Following a 2-min stabilization period, cells were permeabilized with 5 μg of digitonin, and 5 μm rotenone was added to maintain pyridine nucleotides in a reduced form. Isolation of Rat Liver Mitochondria—The liver of a male Sprague-Dawley rat was minced on ice, resuspended in 50 ml of MSH buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, and homogenized with a tight-fitting glass-Teflon motorized homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted and centrifuged at 5,500 × g for 15 min to form a mitochondrial pellet that was washed in MSH buffer, re-centrifuged at 5,500 × g for 15 min, and resuspended in MSH buffer at a protein concentration of 80–100 mg/ml. Caspase-2-induced Cytochrome c Release—Isolated rat liver mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were incubated in the presence or absence of recombinant caspase-2 in a final volume of 100 μl. Incubations were performed either in buffer A, consisting of 140 mm mannitol, 46 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm succinate, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, or buffer B (where indicated), consisting of 150 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm succinate, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4. For caspase-2-induced cytochrome c release from Jurkat T-lymphocytes, cells (106) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 100 μl buffer A, and permeabilized with digitonin (5 μg). Following a 1-min stabilization period, the indicated amount of recombinant caspase-2 was added. Preparation of Liposomes—Lyophilized dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC), 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; CL, cardiolipin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; CCCP, m-chlorophenylhydrazone; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. phosphatidylinositol (PI), and bovine heart cardiolipin (CL) (all from Sigma) were resuspended in chloroform to concentrations of 10–50 mg/ml. Sucrose-loaded liposomes consisting of PC (80%) and PI (20%), PC (80%), and CL (20%) or PC (100%) were prepared using published protocols (13Buser C.A. McLaughlin S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 267-281PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, liposomes of uniform size were prepared in sucrose buffer (256 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) using a lipid extruder equipped with 0.1-μm pore-sized polycarbonate filter (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). Liposomes prepared for pore-forming experiments were made in sucrose buffer supplemented with 5 mg/ml 20-kDa dextran-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Sigma) or 50–200 μg/ml bovine heart cytochrome c (Sigma). After five washes in KCl buffer, the liposome pellets were resuspended in sucrose buffer and stored for a maximum of 1 week at 4 °C. Dextran-FITC liposomes were used within 24 h. Caspase-2-induced Release from Liposomes—Liposomes (100 μg/ml) filled with cytochrome c or 20-kDa dextran-FITC were incubated with various amounts of caspase-2, mutant caspase-2, or caspase-3 in KCl buffer for 20 min at 22 °C. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min, the amount of cytochrome c or dextran-FITC in the supernatant and pellet was evaluated. Cytochrome c release was monitored by Western blotting, whereas dextran release was monitored in duplicates of 150 μl/well in a 96-well plate by recording the FITC fluorescence in a Fluoroscan II plate reader (Labsystems, Stockholm, Sweden) using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and monitoring wavelength of 538 nm. KCl buffer was used as a blank. The extent of dextran-FITC release is reported as a percentage of the total after complete lysis of the liposome pellet with 1% CHAPS in KCl buffer. Cytochrome c Binding to Sucrose-loaded Liposomes—Bovine heart cytochrome c (250 μg/ml final concentration) was incubated with sucrose-loaded liposomes (100 μg/ml) for 30 min at 22 °C in KCl buffer. The liposomes were washed three times in KCl buffer to diminish nonspecific binding of cytochrome c to the phospholipids. Caspase-2 or mutant caspase-2 was added at the indicated concentrations, incubated for 20 min, and the supernatant was subsequently separated from the pellet by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Cytochrome c binding and release were detected by Western blotting. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (4Robertson J.D. Enoksson M. Suomela M. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29803-29809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The antibody used was anti-cytochrome c (1:2,500) (Pharmingen). Estimation of Mitochondrial Respiration—Oxygen consumption by isolated rat liver mitochondria was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Spring Instrument Co.) at 25 °C. Mitochondria with a respiratory control ratio (defined as the rate of respiration in the presence of ADP divided by the rate obtained following the expenditure of ADP) above 4 were used for all experiments. Fresh mitochondria were prepared for each experiment and used within 4 h. Caspase-2 Induces a Rapid and Concentration-dependent Release of Cytochrome c—We have shown recently that caspase-2 can trigger the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from isolated liver mitochondria as well as permeabilized Jurkat T-lymphocytes (12Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Kropotov A. Vakifahmetoglu H. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This effect appears to require processing of the zymogen but not the associated catalytic activity. To further examine the ability of caspase-2 to permeabilize mitochondria and stimulate cytochrome c release, we used wild-type (C-2), catalytically inactive (C303A), and uncleavable (D316G) recombinant caspase-2 proteins to treat permeabilized Jurkat cells, isolated liver mitochondria, or liposomes that had been loaded with either FITC-coupled 20-kDa dextran or bovine heart cytochrome c. Importantly, catalytically inactive caspase-2 (C303A) possessed no VDVADase activity (12Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Kropotov A. Vakifahmetoglu H. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas uncleavable caspase-2 (D316G) retained ∼20% activity relative to that of wild type, which is consistent with data reported previously (14Baliga B.C. Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 2004; (doi10.1038/sj.cdd.4401492)PubMed Google Scholar). When recombinant wild-type caspase-2 was added to permeabilized Jurkat cells (Fig. 1A) or isolated liver mitochondria (Fig. 1B), cytochrome c was released in a rapid and concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, neither catalytically inactive nor uncleavable caspase-2 was able to induce any cytochrome c release (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, only wild-type caspase-2 caused a significant decline in the rate of uncoupled respiration (VCCCP) when mitochondria were incubated with m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (Fig. 1D), an effect that was most likely due to the prominence of cytochrome c release in the presence of caspase-2 (Fig. 1C). These findings, combined with our earlier results demonstrating that the proteolytic activity of caspase-2 is dispensable for membrane permeabilization and/or the release of cytochrome c, suggested that fully processed caspase-2 was targeting directly the outer mitochondrial membrane, or contact sites between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, to cause the release of proapoptotic proteins. Caspase-2 Causes Membrane Permeabilization of Dextran- or Cytochrome c-containing Liposomes—To test this premise and to determine more precisely the molecular requirements for caspase-2-induced membrane permeabilization, experiments were performed using dextran-containing, protein-free liposomes. Importantly, liposome-based methodology has been used by several groups to faithfully mimic the behavior of mitochondria (15Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 16Epand R.F. Martinou J.C. Montessuit S. Epand R.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here, liposomes of varying composition (100% PC; 20% PI, 80% PC; and 20% CL, 80% PC) containing FITC-coupled 20-kDa dextran were prepared and incubated with different amounts of recombinant caspase-2. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, recombinant caspase-2 induced a similar concentration-dependent release of dextran from all three liposome preparations, whereas caspase-3 and the two caspase-2 mutant proteins stimulated the release of only trace amounts of dextran. In light of these findings, the next step was to determine whether caspase-2 would trigger a similar release of cytochrome c from liposomes. However, because cytochrome c preferentially binds to anionic phospholipids, notably CL located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (17Tuominen E.K. Wallace C.J. Kinnunen P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8822-8826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 18Iverson S.L. Enoksson M. Gogvadze V. Ott M. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1100-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we conjectured that the binding of cytochrome c to CL-containing liposomes might be different. Therefore, to ensure equal loading and binding to the lipid membrane among all liposome preparations, different amounts of cytochrome c were used for liposomes containing an anionic phospholipid (PI or CL) as compared with liposomes containing only PC (50 μg of cytochrome c/ml and 200 μg of cytochrome c/ml, respectively). Treatment of liposomes with caspase-2 resulted in the same release pattern of cytochrome c as was observed for the dextran experiments. Specifically, low amounts of caspase-2 led to only trace amounts of cytochrome c release, whereas robust cytochrome c release was observed when liposomes were incubated with either 1000 or 1500 ng of caspase-2 (Fig. 2B). Notably, neither caspase-3 nor mutant caspase-2 was able to induce a release of cytochrome c from the liposomes (Fig. 2C), which is consistent with our previous findings with isolated mitochondria and permeabilized cells (12Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Kropotov A. Vakifahmetoglu H. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Caspase-2 Causes Detachment of Cytochrome c from the Outer Surface of Liposomes—Interestingly, we determined during the aforementioned experiments (Fig. 2) that liposomes with cytochrome c attached to the outer (as well as the inner) surface of the membrane, as a result of fewer washing steps, would release their cytochrome c when incubated in the presence of lower, non-permeabilizing concentrations of caspase-2 (data not shown). As expected, this observation was especially pronounced in liposomes containing CL and could possibly be explained by caspase-2-mediated detachment of cytochrome c from CL on the outer surface of liposomes. To further investigate this possibility, experiments were performed with sucrose-loaded liposomes that had cytochrome c bound to the outer surface only (Fig. 3). These liposomes were incubated with cytochrome c (250 μg/ml) and thereafter washed gently with KCl buffer. This had the effect of decreasing the amount of loosely, non-specifically bound cytochrome c to the outer surface while allowing some retention of cytochrome c binding to the anionic phospholipids, PI and CL (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 3, and 7). Next, concentrations of caspase-2 that were below those required for permeabilization (cf. Fig. 2, A and B) were used to treat these liposomes (Fig. 3). The results indicated that caspase-2 caused the detachment of cytochrome c from liposomes containing either PI or CL (Fig. 3, lanes 4, 5, 8, and 9). Moreover, caspase-2 was slightly more efficient at detaching cytochrome c from the outer surface of CL-containing liposomes (Fig. 3), suggesting that caspase-2 may have a slightly higher affinity for cardiolipin as has been described previously for Bid (19Lutter M. Fang M. Luo X. Nishijima M. Xie X. Wang X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 20Kim T.H. Zhao Y. Ding W.X. Shin J.N. He X. Seo Y.W. Chen J. Rabinowich H. Amoscato A.A. Yin X.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3061-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A Low Concentration of Caspase-2 Augments Cytochrome c Release Induced by Digitonin or Bax—Because caspase-2 seemed to be disrupting cytochrome c binding to CL in liposomes, it was of interest to test this possibility using whole mitochondria. To that end, isolated rat liver mitochondria were incubated with a non-permeabilizing amount (10 ng) of caspase-2 and either recombinant oligomeric Bax or digitonin (Fig. 4, A and B). In both instances, the inclusion of 10 ng of caspase-2 led to significantly more cytochrome c being released, presumably due to caspase-2-mediated dissociation of the interaction between cytochrome c and CL. Importantly, the cytochrome c release data correlated nicely with the functional data obtained indicating that, although 10 ng of caspase-2 alone had no effect on respiration, its inclusion with digitonin resulted in a more severe decline in both state 3 and uncoupled (CCCP) respiration than was observed with digitonin alone (Fig. 4C). The rate of uncoupled respiration was partially restored upon inclusion of cytochrome c in the incubation medium. Concluding Remarks—In the current study, we show that caspase-2 can permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane in a direct manner. Studies with liposomes revealed that this process requires neither other proteins nor a particular phospholipid composition of the liposomal membrane. Permeabilization appears to have been due to pore formation as incubation of liposomes with caspase-2 did not result in any apparent change in their size distribution (data not shown). This, combined with our previous finding that AIF was not released by treatment of isolated mitochondria or permeabilized Jurkat cells with caspase-2, whereas cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO were, argues against a detergent-like effect of caspase-2 being responsible for the release of proteins from mitochondria (12Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Kropotov A. Vakifahmetoglu H. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Binding of cytochrome c to the inner mitochondrial membrane is known to involve a unique mitochondrial phospholipid, cardiolipin (17Tuominen E.K. Wallace C.J. Kinnunen P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8822-8826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). There is also ample evidence that a decreased level of cardiolipin in the mitochondrial membrane, as a result of inhibited synthesis, accelerated break down, or oxidative stress, leads to impaired cytochrome c binding and increases the susceptibility of cells to undergo mitochondrially mediated apoptosis (see (21Iverson S.L. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) for review). Furthermore, cardiolipin was shown to be a mitochondrial target for the proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein, Bid, and to play a critical role in mitochondrial permeabilization/cytochrome c release by tBid/Bax (15Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 19Lutter M.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30081-30091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The cardiolipin precursor, phosphatidylglycerol, and other anionic phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylinositol) can partially substitute for cardiolipin, but their association with cytochrome c is considerably weaker as compared with that of cardiolipin (18Iverson S.L. Enoksson M. Gogvadze V. Ott M. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1100-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our results show that caspase-2 has the surprising ability to disrupt the association between cytochrome c and anionic phospholipids, notably CL, thereby making additional cytochrome c available for release into the cytosol/supernatant. This effect probably explains why considerably more cytochrome c is released from mitochondria treated with caspase-2 as compared with digitonin or recombinant oligomeric Bax. An alternate explanation might be that caspase-2 can stimulate unfolding of mitochondrial cristae in a manner resembling that of tBid (20Kim T.H. Zhao Y. Ding W.X. Shin J.N. He X. Seo Y.W. Chen J. Rabinowich H. Amoscato A.A. Yin X.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3061-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Considering the number of pathways reportedly linking cytotoxic stress with mitochondrial engagement (see Ref. 23Zhivotovsky B. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 752-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar for review), it would seem reasonable that the extent of the involvement of caspase-2 is likely to depend on a number of factors, including the nature of the cytotoxic stimulus, the cell type that is being affected, and the intracellular abundance of caspase-2 relative to that of other proapoptotic proteins (e.g. Bax/Bak). Our current data suggest that in some instances caspase-2 may be responsible for direct permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, while in other instances, caspase-2 may act in conjunction with Bax/Bak to amplify cytochrome c release by causing its displacement from cardiolipin. However, additional studies are needed to better understand how these different scenarios play out under physiological conditions. We thank Emad Alnemri for the caspase-2 and caspase-2 C303A bacterial expression constructs and Susanne Ahlberg for excellent technical assistance."

In contrast, cPLA2-α inhibition or gene disruption diminished neutrophil-mediated E. coli killing in vitro, which was partially rescued by exogenous arachidonic acid or PAF but not leukotriene B4. Following intratracheal inoculation with live E. coli in vivo, pulmonary PAF biosynthesis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and clearance of E. coli were attenuated in cPLA2-α(–/–) mice compared with wild type littermates.

Bacterial pneumonia is a significant cause of morbidity and a leading cause of mortality, especially in very young, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals (1Kochanek K.D. Smith B.L. Natl. Vital. Stat. Rep. 2004; 52: 1-47PubMed Google Scholar, 2Baughman R.P. Respiration. 1999; 66: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Bacterial infection of the lung stimulates an innate immune response that is characterized by the local generation of pro-inflammatory mediators, increased microvascular permeability, and the influx of leukocytes, which generate oxidants, release cytotoxic enzymes, and kill invading bacteria (3Zhang P. Summer W.R. Bagby G.J. Nelson S. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). A variety of host and bacterial mediators are responsible for attracting leukocytes to sites of bacterial infection, including cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators. The first step in the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators such as leukotrienes and thromboxanes, which are pivotal to the development of an effective innate immune response, can be catalyzed by cytosolic phospholipase PLA2-α (cPLA2-α), 1The abbreviations used are: cPLA2-α, cytosolic phospholipase A2-α; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; d8-arachidonic acid, [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-2H]arachidonic acid; PAF, platelet-activating factor; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; d3-PAF, PAF with a 2,2,2-trideuteroacetyl group and a sn-1-hexadecyl group; C18-lyso-PC, 1-octadecyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine; OZ, opsonized zymosan; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; ANOVA, analysis of variance; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; 5-LO, 5-lipoxygenase; LTB4, leukotriene B4 Me, methyl; GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor.1The abbreviations used are: cPLA2-α, cytosolic phospholipase A2-α; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; d8-arachidonic acid, [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-2H]arachidonic acid; PAF, platelet-activating factor; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; d3-PAF, PAF with a 2,2,2-trideuteroacetyl group and a sn-1-hexadecyl group; C18-lyso-PC, 1-octadecyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine; OZ, opsonized zymosan; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; ANOVA, analysis of variance; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; 5-LO, 5-lipoxygenase; LTB4, leukotriene B4 Me, methyl; GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. which selectively liberates arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of phospholipids (4Leslie C.C.

In addition, arachidonic acid generated by cPLA2-α is proposed to play a role in the assembly and activation of the NAPDH oxidase in professional phagocytic cells in vitro (8Dana R. Leto T.L.

These observations support a potential role for cPLA2-α in the innate immune response to bacterial infection. cPLA2-α can also hydrolyze 1-O-alkyl phospholipids, leading to the formation of lyso-PAF, which can be acetylated to form PAF. The administration of PAF induces pulmonary edema, pulmonary neutrophil sequestration, and hypoxemia (11Goggel R. Winoto-Morbach S. Vielhaber G. Imai Y. Lindner K. Brade L. Brade H. Ehlers S.

In addition, PAF appears to play a central role in the pathophysiology of endotoxin, immunocomplex, intestinal ischemiareperfusion, and acid aspiration-induced lung injury (12Miotla J.M. Jeffery P.K.

PAF biosynthesis in response to the calcium ionophore A23187 or to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was markedly attenuated in peritoneal macrophages from cPLA2-α(–/–) mice compared with macrophages from wild type mice (16Bonventre J.V. Huang Z. Taheri M.R. O'Leary E. Li E. Moskowitz M.A. Sapirstein A. Nature. 1997; 390: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The role of cPLA2-α in the regulation of neutrophil PAF biosynthesis in response to a physiologically relevant agonist, such as opsonized zymosan, and the role of cPLA2-α in the regulation of the innate immune response to bacterial infection in vivo have not been evaluated. Deletion of PLA2g4a, the gene that encodes cPLA2-α, attenuates the inflammatory response and lung injury associated with acid aspiration, intravenous infusion of lipopolysaccharide-zymosan, and treatment with bleomycin (17Nagase T. Uozumi N. Ishii S. Kume K. Izumi T. Ouchi Y. Shimizu T. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 18Nagase T. Uozumi N. Ishii S. Kita Y. Yamamoto H. Ohga E. Ouchi Y. Shimizu T. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, which used the same PLA2g4a(–/–) mouse as the one employed in the current series of experiments, the inhibition of cPLA2-α was proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with acid aspiration or bleomycin-induced lung injury or pulmonary sepsis. Because cPLA2-α plays a role in the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators and may participate in the regulation of neutrophil oxidant production and phagocytosis, we hypothesized that the inhibition of cPLA2-α activity would attenuate the innate immune response to live bacterial infection. In this study, we demonstrated that cPLA2-α catalyzes arachidonic acid release, initiates PAF biosynthesis, and partially regulates Escherichia coli killing by neutrophils in vitro and that exogenous arachidonic acid reverses the defect in neutrophil E. coli killing induced by the inhibition or genetic deletion of cPLA2-α. In addition, we showed that deletion of a functional cPLA2-α gene impairs PAF biosynthesis and eradication of Gram-negative bacteria from the lung in vivo. Our observations identify a new role for cPLA2-α in the regulation of neutrophil-mediated bacterial killing and the innate immune response to Gram-negative bacterial infection. Surprisingly, we show that cPLA2-α does not participate in the regulation of neutrophil oxidant production.

Shimizu (Department of Geriatric Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Preparation of Human and Mouse Neutrophils—All of the experimental protocols involving the use of mice were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University Health Network. PLA2g4a(–/–) mice, or their wild type littermates were anesthetized with isofluorane and euthanized by cervical dislocation. The femur and tibia were dissected, cut proximally and distally, and flushed with ice-cold 1× HBSS (supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), and the eluant was centrifuged at 2,600 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C over a three-layer Percoll gradient (52, 65, and 75%) (21Kruger J. Butler J.R. Cherapanov V. Dong Q. Ginzberg H. Govindarajan A. Grinstein S. Siminovitch K.A. Downey G.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5847-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The neutrophil-rich fraction was collected at the interface of the 65 and 75% layers, resuspended in 1× HBSS, and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 1× HBSS containing 2.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and used immediately. Human peripheral neutrophils were isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated blood obtained from healthy donors not taking any medications by dextran sedimentation (T500, Amersham Biosciences), hypotonic lysis of residual red blood cells, and centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) (23Waddell T.K.

The human and murine neutrophil isolation protocols routinely yielded cell suspensions that were >90% neutrophils with >98% viability as judged by Wright stain and trypan blue exclusion (22Marshall J. Krump E. Lindsay T. Downey G. Ford D.A. Zhu P. Walker P. Rubin B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), respectively. All of the neutrophil studies were carried out at 37 °C. Analysis of Arachidonic Acid and PAF Mass—Human neutrophils (107/sample) or mouse neutrophils (106/sample) were stimulated with various agonists (see figure and table legends). After stimulation, 38 pmol of d3-PAF and 22 pmol of d8-arachidonic acid were added as internal standards and the entire sample (cells + medium) was extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). One-tenth of the Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) organic phase was processed for arachidonic acid analysis, and the remainder was processed for PAF analysis. For arachidonic acid analysis, the solvent was removed (SpeedVac, Savant Instruments), 0.5 ml of water was added, the sample was extracted with Dole solvent, and arachidonic acid was quantified as its pentafluorobenzyl ester by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (25Bartoli F. Lin H.K. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Jain M.K. Apitz-Castro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15625-15630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For PAF analysis, the sample was concentrated to 100–200 μl (SpeedVac) and transferred to a conical insert of a Hewlett Packard HPLC auto-injector vial. After complete removal of solvent, the residue was dissolved in 50 μl of 88% methanol/water and 40 μl was injected onto the HPLC column (Zorbax Extend C-18, 2.1 × 100 mm, 3.5 m, 80 Å, Agilent Technologies), which was developed at 200 ml/min with 88% methanol, 12% water, and 0.5% concentrated NH4OH for 4 min and then with 88% methanol, 12% hexane, and 0.5% concentrated NH4OH for more than 11 min. The column eluant was directly infused into a Sciex API III+ mass spectrometer operating in a negative ion mode. Multiple reaction-monitoring mode was used with the monitoring of 508/59 (d0-PAF), 508/283 (C18-lyso-PC), and 511/62 (d3-PAF). 508 is the d0-PAF minus methyl negative ion, and 59 is the acetate ion. 508 is also the minus methyl anion for C18-lyso-PC, and 283 is the stearate anion (26Harrison K.A. Clay K.L. Murphy R.C. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 330-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The collision energy was 25 volts, the collision gas thickness was 270 × 1013 molecules/cm2, and the orifice voltage was –95 volts. The resolution setting on the first quadrupole (RE1) was 103 volts, and the delta mass on the same quadrupole (DM1) was –0.4 volts. The resolution setting on the second mass filter (third quadrupole) was RE3 = 110 volts, DM3 = 0.5 volts. Measurement of Neutrophil NADPH Oxidase Activity—Opsonized zymosan (OZ) was prepared from human serum depleted of IgG by ammonium sulfate (28.5%) precipitation (27Yaffe M.B. Xu J. Burke P.A. Forse R.A. Brown G.E. Surgery. 1999; 126: 248-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Extracellular superoxide release by human neutrophils was measured with the cytochrome c assay (23Waddell T.K. Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Kishimoto T.K. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18485-18491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For some studies, luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (27Yaffe M.B. Xu J. Burke P.A. Forse R.A. Brown G.E. Surgery. 1999; 126: 248-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used to monitor reactive oxygen species production by neutrophils. For chemiluminescence studies, reactions were initiated by adding 4 × 103 neutrophils in 25 μl of PBS containing 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 150 mm luminol to 75 μl of the same buffer (prewarmed to 37 °C) ± inhibitors and/or agonists as indicated in the legend for Fig. 4, panels E–H. Chemiluminescence events were measured in a Berthold Autolumat LB953 luminometer. Data are the mean luminescence events ×10–5 integrated over 15 min. Murine neutrophil H2O2 production was assessed with dihydrorhodamine-123 (1 μm), a membrane-permeable probe that is oxidized by H2O2 to yield fluorescent rhodamine-123. Dihydrorhodamine-123 was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with murine neutrophils (1 × 106) before treatment with agonists (23Waddell T.K. Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Kishimoto T.K. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18485-18491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mean fluorescence index of >104 cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis (fluorescence-activated cell sorter, BD Biosciences) from gated regions on dot plots for each sample (28Vowells S.J.

Bacterial Killing Assay—A single colony of E. coli DH5α was cultured in Luria-Bertani broth overnight at 2,500 rpm and 37 °C in an orbital-incubated shaker (Lab-Line MaxQ 5000 floor shaker; Barnstead/Lab-Line), spun at 2,500 rpm for 10 min, and resuspended in HBSS++ at 109 cells/ml. Bacteria were then opsonized for 30 min at 37 °C in heat-inactivated bovine serum, washed, and resuspended in HBSS++ at 3 × 107 cells/ml. Human neutrophils were resuspended in HBSS++ at 107 cells/ml and incubated with vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1%) or Pyrrolidine-1 (10 μm) for 5 min followed by incubation with vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1%), arachidonic acid (5 μm), or PAF (500 nm) for 5 min at 37 °C as indicated in the figure legends. Human neutrophils (100 μl) were then co-incubated with E. coli (100 μl) in a Thermomixer (FinePCR, Finemould Precision Ind Co.) for 1 h at 37 °C. Murine neutrophils from PLA2g4a(+/+) or PLA2g4a(–/–) mice were resuspended in HBSS++ at 107 cells/ml and incubated with vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1%), MK886 (1 μm), or U75302 (10 μm) for 5 min at 37 °C and then incubated with Me2SO (0.1%), arachidonic acid (5 μm), PAF (500 nm), or LTB4 (10 nm) for 5 min at 37 °C as indicated in the figure legends. Murine neutrophils (100 μl) were then co-incubated with E. coli (100 μl) in a Thermomixer for 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, samples were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed by incubation in 0.2% Triton X-100. Bacterial viability was assessed by 101-105-fold serial dilution culture of samples done in triplicate. E. coli Pneumonia Model and Collection of Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) Fluid—Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine (8 mg/kg) and Rompun (1 mg/kg), placed in supine position, and swabbed with 70% alcohol along the anterior neck, and the trachea was exposed. 50 μl of E+9 E. coli DH5α in PBS was then injected into the trachea with a 30-gauge needle, and the wound was closed with 5-0 Dermalon suture. After 3 h, mice were re-anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine and Rompun. The anterior surface of the abdomen was soaked with alcohol, the skin was incised, and the mice were euthanized by transection of the abdominal aorta. The neck wound was then resterilized with alcohol, and the trachea was exposed and cannulated with a 20-gauge needle followed by infusion of 1.0 ml of PBS at room temperature. After 10 s, the trachea was aspirated and the BAL was placed on ice. The collection of BAL fluid was then repeated a total of five times, and the BAL fluid was pooled. Blood was obtained in a sterile fashion from cPLA2-α(+/+) and cPLA2-α(–/–) mice immediately before and 3 h after intratracheal administration of live E. coli. Bacterial viability in BAL fluid, lung tissue, and blood was assessed by serial dilution culture (29Sajjan U. Thanassoulis G. Cherapanov V. Lu A. Sjolin C. Steer B. Wu Y.J. Rotstein O.D. Kent G.

Measurement of E. coli Phagocytosis by Murine Neutrophils—E. coli X1-blue bacteria were grown overnight, subcultured, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (1 mg/ml) for 10 min with constant rotation at 25 °C. After two washes with PBS, bacteria were fixed with glutaraldehyde (1%) for 20 min, washed twice with PBS, and then opsonized with mouse serum for 30 min. Opsonized bacteria were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in HBSS at 107/ml. Murine neutrophils (106 cells/ml) were resuspended in prewarmed HBSS containing LysoTracker (100 nm) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice (to remove excess dye), added to microtubes, and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C on a Thermomixer. After mixing equal volumes of neutrophils and opsonized bacteria, cells were incubated at 37 °C and observed under a ×63 immersion objective with a heating plate at 37 °C. Images were acquired by a Leica fluorescence microscope and analyzed with Openlab 3.1.5 software. Phagocytosis rates (percent of neutrophils phagocytosing at least one E. coli bacterium) were based on counts between 300 and 2000 neutrophils/experiment. Measurement of Primary and Secondary Neutrophil Granule Secretion—Freshly isolated human neutrophils were incubated with vehicle (Me2SO 0.1%) or Pyrrolidine-1 (10 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C as indicated in the figure legends. After washing, cells were incubated with cytochalasin D (10 μm) and aggregated human IgG or with ionomycin (2 μm) for a further 10 min at 37 °C, fixed with paraformaldehyde, rinsed, and then incubated with either 1:20 αN-RAS (irrelevant IgG), 1:50 αCD63, or 1:100 αCD66b primary antibodies for 1 h on ice. After washing, neutrophils were incubated with 1:1000 goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 secondary antibody for 1 h on ice, washed again, and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, 10,000 events for each sample). The relative fluorescence index for each sample is reported. Cytometric Bead Array—TNFα, interferon-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, and MCP-1 levels in BAL fluid were measured with cytometric bead array kits according to the manufacturer's protocols (BD Biosciences) (30Morgan E.

Specific capture beads for cytokines and chemokines were mixed with 50 μl of BAL fluid or standards, and multiple phycoerythrin-conjugated detection antibodies were added. Following a 3-h incubation period with recombinant protein standards or test samples, the acquisition of sample data were performed using a two-color flow cytometer.

Statistical Analysis—The effect of treatment with increasing concentrations of Pyrrolidine-1 on arachidonic acid release and PAF biosynthesis and the effect of Pyrrolidine-1 or genetic deletion of PLA2g4a on neutrophil-mediated bacterial killing were assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). A comparison between specific subgroups was made by paired Student's t tests (two-tailed) and assumed unequal variance. All of the data were presented as the mean ± S.D. A p value < 0.05 was considered to be significant. cPLA2-α Mediates Neutrophil Arachidonate Release—To ascertain the importance of cPLA2-α in arachidonic acid release, human neutrophils incubated with the specific cPLA2-α inhibitor Pyrrolidine-1, which does not inhibit cPLA2-γ, calcium-independent group VI PLA2 or group IIA, group V- or group X-secreted PLA2 activity (19Ghomashchi F.

As shown in Fig. 1B, Pyrrolidine-1 blocked OZ-stimulated arachidonic acid release at all of the time points (1, 5, and 10 min), whereas Me-Indoxam had no effect on OZ-stimulated arachidonic acid release. Stimulation of human neutrophils with fMLP in the presence of cytochalasin B (Fig. 1C) or GM-CSF (Fig. 1D) led to a 3–4-fold increase in arachidonic acid release, and this was fully blocked by Pyrrolidine-1 with an IC50 of ∼0.1 μm. Me-Indoxam had no effect on cytochalasin B + fMLP or GM-CSF + fMLP-stimulated arachidonic acid release by human neutrophils (Fig. 1, C and D). Arachidonic acid release by quiescent neutrophils from PLA2g4a(+/+) and PLA2g4a(–/–) mice was similar (Table I). Exposure of neutrophils from PLA2g4a(+/+) mice to OZ resulted in a 4- and 7-fold increase in arachidonic acid release above base-line levels from two different preparations of mouse neutrophils, respectively. In contrast, exposure to OZ had no effect on arachidonate release by neutrophils from PLA2g4a(–/–) mice (Table I).

https://openalex.org/W2037791669,A persistent reversal in the expected polarity of the initiation of vertically polarized shear waves that graze the D″ layer (the layer at the boundary between the outer core and the lower mantle of Earth) in some regions starts at the arrival time of horizontally polarized shear waves. Full waveform modeling of the split shear waves for paths beneath the Caribbean requires azimuthal anisotropy at the base of the mantle. Models with laterally coherent patterns of transverse isotropy with the hexagonal symmetry axis of the mineral phases tilted from the vertical by as much as 20° are consistent with the data. Small-scale convection cells within the mantle above the D″ layer may cause the observed variations by inducing laterally variable crystallographic or shape-preferred orientation in minerals in the D″ layer.
https://openalex.org/W2141901389,"Functional activation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) is proposed to decrease reactive oxygen species production. Skulachev and Goglia (Skulachev, V. P., and Goglia, F. (2003) FASEB J. 17, 1585–1591) hypothesized that hydroperoxy fatty acid anions are translocated by UCPs but cannot flip-flop across the membrane. We found that the second aspect is otherwise; the addition of synthesized linoleic acid hydroperoxides (LAOOH, a mix of four isomers) caused a fast flip-flop-dependent acidification of liposomes, comparable with the linoleic acid (LA)-dependent acidification. Using Escherichia coli-expressed UCP2 reconstituted into liposomes we found that LAOOH induced purine nucleotide-sensitive H+ uniport in UCP2-proteoliposomes with higher affinity than LA (Km values 97 μm for LAOOH and 275 μm for LA). In UCP2-proteoliposomes LAOOH also induced purine nucleotide-sensitive K+ influx balanced by anionic charge transfer, indicating that LAOOH was also transported as an anion with higher affinity than linoleate anion, the Km values being 90 and 350 μm, respectively. These data suggest that hydroperoxy fatty acids are transported via UCP2 by a fatty acid cycling mechanism. This may alternatively explain the observed activation of UCP2 by the externally generated superoxide. The ability of LAOOH to induce UCP2-mediated H+ uniport points to the essential role of superoxide reaction products, such as hydroperoxyl radical, hydroxyl radical, or peroxynitrite, initiating lipoperoxidation, the released products of which support the UCP2-mediated uncoupling and promote the feedback down-regulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production.

Chem. 2004; (August 17, 10.1074/jbc.M407715200)Google Scholar). A spectrum of radical and non-radical compounds is produced from O2⋅¯, which are commonly called reactive oxygen species (ROS). 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; FA(s), fatty acid(s); FAOH, hydroxy-fatty acid; FAOOH or FAOOH-COOH, fatty acid hydroperoxides; HNE, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; LA, linoleic acid; LAOOH, linoleic acid hydroperoxides; PLA2, phospholipase A2; PUFAs, polyunsaturated FAs; SPQ, 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethane sulfonic acid; UCP2, “ubiquitous” uncoupling protein; UCP, uncoupling protein. These include radicals (O2⋅¯, hydroperoxyl (HO2·), hydroxyl (·OH), peroxyl (RO2·), alkoxyl (RO·)) and nonradical species such as H2O2 and singlet oxygen (3Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7531) Google Scholar, 4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, 2002: 936Google Scholar). The list is extended by peroxynitrite, which is formed by the reaction of O2⋅¯ with nitric oxide, ·NO (12Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rubbo H. Radi R. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Kalyanaraman B. Barnes S. Kirk M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol.

Sci. 2002; 959: 219-225Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and by cytosolic CuZn-superoxide dismutase, which exists also in the mitochondrial intramembrane space (2Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H.

At pH 6.8, ∼1% of O2⋅¯ is protonated to highly reactive species, hydroperoxyl radical HO2· (pKa 4.8) (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, 2002: 936Google Scholar). H2O2 may be converted into highly reactive ·OH by a reaction with transition metals, namely with Fe2+ (Fenton reaction) (3Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7531) Google Scholar, 4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, 2002: 936Google Scholar). The ·OH is an extremely reactive oxidizing radical that will react to most biomolecules at diffusion-controlled rates. The hydroxyl radical can also oxidize nitrite to nitrogen dioxide (·NO2) and react with bicarbonate yielding the very reactive carbonate radical anion under physiological conditions (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, 2002: 936Google Scholar). All of these highly reactive radicals (HO2·, ·OH, and CO3⋅¯) attack proteins and DNA, but, in addition, a substantial lipoperoxidation must occur in vivo, because polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chains are very susceptible to allelic hydrogen abstraction (3Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7531) Google Scholar, 4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine.

Once carbon-centered lipid radicals (RC·R) are generated, they react with O2 giving peroxyl radicals (ROO·), which react for example with the neighbor polyunsaturated hydrocarbon side chain yielding hydroperoxides (ROOH) and other RC·R. The reaction is thus propagated by many cycles (18Spiteller G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 959: 30-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fatty acid hydroperoxides (FAOOH) can be cleaved off from the phospholipids by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (20Miyamoto S. Dupas C. Murota K. Terao J. Lipids. 2003; 38: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), e.g. by its mitochondrial Ca2+-dependent isoform induced by superoxide (21Guidarelli A. Cantoni O. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 307-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by the Ca2+-independent isoform. FAOOH are transient, non-radical but reactive species, which are eventually degraded by glutathione peroxidase or phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase to the corresponding hydroxy fatty acids (FAOH). FAOOH may also decompose to toxic epoxy acids and α,β,γ,δ-unsaturated aldehydes (18Spiteller G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 959: 30-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It has been found that even a slight increase of H+ backflux into the matrix may substantially suppress mitochondrial ROS formation (7Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 8Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A.

The physiological H+ backflow during ATP synthesis also suppresses ROS formation (7Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar); therefore most ROS are produced in the non-phosphorylating state. This effect of uncoupling or ATP synthesis is due to increased respiration and hence concomitantly shortened lifetime of UQ⋅¯ and the lowered oxygen tension in the microenvironment which results in reduced rate of O2⋅¯ formation (7Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 8Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A.

Recently, however, that group has abandoned the direct interaction of O2⋅¯ with UCP2 and instead ascribes this ability to end-products of the lipoperoxidation cascade, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) (35Echtay K.S.

We suggest an alternative mechanism in which the FAOOH produced by elevated ROS behave as cycling substrates of the UCPs. In this mechanism, UCP acts as a flipase to transport the fatty acid (FA) anionic head group across the membrane. The FA is protonated and rapidly flip-flops back across the membrane, delivering protons electroneutrally across the membrane (38Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Ježek P. J. Biol.

We found that LAOOH does rapidly flip-flop across the membrane, resulting in the delivery of protons to the interior. Moreover, LAOOH supports uncoupling in liposomes containing UCP2, and it does so with a higher affinity than was observed for linoleic acid itself. We concluded that LAOOH is an efficient cycling substrate of UCP2. The finding that FAOOH supports UCP-mediated uncoupling suggests an alternative explanation for the reported activation of UCP2 by externally generated superoxide observed exclusively in the presence of FAs (33Echtay K.S.

We report here our investigation into this process focusing on the role of amino acids involved in a hydrogen bond network around the retinal Schiff base. We find conservative mutations in this network (T94I, E113Q, S186A, E181Q, Y192F, and Y268F) increase the activation energy (Ea) and abolish the concave Arrhenius plot normally seen for Schiff base hydrolysis in dark state rhodopsin. Interestingly, two mutants (T94I and E113Q) show dramatically faster rates of Schiff base hydrolysis in dark state rhodopsin, yet slower hydrolysis rates in the active MII form. We find deuterium affects the hydrolysis process in wild-type rhodopsin, exhibiting a specific isotope effect of ∼2.5, and proton inventory studies indicate that multiple proton transfer events occur during the process of Schiff base hydrolysis for both dark state and MII forms. Taken together, our study demonstrates the importance of the retinal hydrogen bond network both in maintaining Schiff base integrity in dark state rhodopsin, as well as in catalyzing the hydrolysis and release of retinal from the MII form. Finally, we note that the dramatic alteration of Schiff base stability caused by mutation T94I may play a causative role in congenital night blindness as has been suggested by the Oprian and Garriga laboratories.

A transmembrane receptor, it has evolved into an efficient photoreceptor by covalently binding its chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, to lysine 296 via a protonated Schiff base linkage within the helical bundle (8Wald G.

Dim light vision begins when the 11-cis-retinal chromophore absorbs a photon and isomerizes to the all-trans-retinal form. This change in retinal initiates a series of photo-intermediates and conformational changes in the protein, resulting in the formation of metarhodopsin II (MII), 1The abbreviations used are: MII, metarhodopsin II; DM, n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; Ea, energy of activation; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; WT, wild-type; λmax, absorbance maxima.1The abbreviations used are: MII, metarhodopsin II; DM, n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; Ea, energy of activation; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; WT, wild-type; λmax, absorbance maxima. the active conformation of rhodopsin that is able to bind and activate the G-protein transducin. The MII photoproduct is in dynamic equilibrium with its predecessor MI, and this MI/MII pool is thought to decay through two processes (10Vogel R. Siebert F. Mathias G. Tavan P. Fan G. Sheves M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9863-9874Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The MII product may be directly hydrolyzed and release all-trans-retinal from the binding pocket, or the MI pool may undergo an addition thermal isomerization along the chromophore C=N double bond (all-trans 15-syn) giving rise to the MIII storage product (10Vogel R. Siebert F. Mathias G. Tavan P. Fan G. Sheves M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9863-9874Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This MIII intermediate also decays to opsin and all-trans-retinal (albeit at a slower rate) either through the MI/MII pool or possibly direct retinal Schiff base hydrolysis of the MIII intermediate.Rhodopsin deactivation ultimately requires hydrolysis of the all-trans-retinal Schiff base linkage and release of retinal from the binding pocket. Recycling the receptor and returning it to a photosensitive conformational state completes the recovery process (11Palczewski K. Saari J.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The retinoid cycle accomplishes this task by converting the released all-trans-retinal back to the 11-cis conformation through a series of enzymatic reactions, eventually resulting in the reformation of the retinal Schiff base linkage and regeneration of the photosensitive receptor (12McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 13Rando R.R. Chem.

Although extensive research into Schiff base formation and the retinoid cycle has resulted in a wealth of knowledge (12McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin.

Furthermore, although the retinal Schiff base linkage is quite stable in dark state rhodopsin, it hydrolyzes quickly in the active MII signaling state of the protein (1Ebrey T. Koutalos Y. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 49-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 20Cooper A. Dixon S. Nutley M. Robb J. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2430-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), suggesting that some change probably occurs in the vicinity of the Schiff base attachment site to account for this disparity. Clearly the apoprotein plays a significant role in stabilizing the retinal Schiff base linkage.Recently, a high resolution structure of rhodopsin suggested the presence of a hydrogen bond network encompassing the retinal Schiff base attachment site near extracellular loop E-2 and the “retinal plug” domain (23Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). This network consists of both the carbonyl backbone and side chains of amino acids lining the retinal binding pocket as well as water molecules within the pocket that surround the retinal Schiff base linkage. This network was recently demonstrated to play a key role in the protonated Schiff base counter ion switch mechanism proposed to occur upon formation of the MI photointermediate subsequent to light activation (24Yan E.C. Kazmi M.A. Ganim Z. Hou J.M. Pan D. Chang B.S. Sakmar T.P. Mathies R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9262-9267Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, the role that this retinal hydrogen bond network plays in stabilizing the retinal Schiff base and in potentially participating in the mechanism of Schiff base hydrolysis remains as yet unexplored.In the this study we report our investigation into the role of the retinal hydrogen bond network in relation to the retinal Schiff base linkage in rhodopsin. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we find that disruption of this network results in compromised stability of the Schiff base linkage in the dark state and a loss of concave Arrhenius plots for all of the mutant proteins (especially for residues Thr94 and Glu113). In addition, we find that mutation of this network also affects Schiff base stability in the MII state, but only at some sites. Paradoxically, mutation of these sites (Thr94, Glu113 and Ser186) actually slows MII decay, suggesting that these residues act as participants in Schiff base hydrolysis and retinal release process. Finally, through deuterium isotope studies, we provide evidence that multiple proton transfer events occur during the process of Schiff base hydrolysis and subsequent retinal release and that this process proceeds through a carbinolamine intermediate. Our results further illustrate how the rhodopsin structure maintains Schiff base integrity and provides insight to the mechanism of Schiff base hydrolysis and retinal release.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Buffers—Except where noted, all buffers and chemicals were purchased from either Fisher or Sigma. n-Dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DM) was purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH), Polystyrene columns (2-ml bed volume) were purchased from Pierce.

Chem. 1982; 257: 6452-6460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). 11-cis-Retinal was a generous gift from Dr. R. Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina and the National Eye Institute). The 1D4 antibody was purchased from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). The nonapeptide corresponding to the C terminus of rhodopsin was acquired from the Emory University Microchemical Facility (Atlanta, GA). Cuvettes were purchased from Uvonics (Plainview, NY). Deuterium oxide was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA). Centrifugal filter devices (0.5 μm volume, 10-kDa cut off) were purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Definitions for the buffers used are as follows: PBSSC (0.137 M NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, and 8 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2)), buffer A (1% DM and PBSSC (pH 7.2)), buffer B (2 mm ATP, 0.1% DM, 1 m NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.2)), buffer C (0.05% DM and PBSSC (pH 7.0)), buffer D (0.05% DM and 5 mm MES (pH 6.0)).Construction, Expression, and Purification of Rhodopsin Mutants—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using overlap extension PCR to generate fragments containing the mutation of interest (T94I, E113Q, E181Q, S186A, Y192F, and Y268F) in the synthetic bovine rhodopsin gene (26Ferretti L.

A. 1986; 83: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) essentially as described previously and subcloned into the pMT4 plasmid (27Janz J.M. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7219-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Janz J.M. Fay J.F. Farrens D.L. J. Biol.

All mutations were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide sequencing method.The mutant rhodopsin proteins were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells using the DEAE-dextran method, and cells were harvested 56-72 h after transfection as described previously (27Janz J.M. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7219-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The harvested opsin mutants were subsequently regenerated with 10 μm 11-cis-retinal at 4 °C for 1 h followed by an additional 5 μm of 11-cis retinal and 1-h incubation (30Reeves P.J. Hwa J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1927-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The purification of the rhodopsin mutants proceeded essentially as the original procedure (29Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) with modifications as previously described (28Janz J.M. Fay J.F. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16982-16991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A spectrum of each elution fraction was recorded, and the purified samples were either used immediately or snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C.UV-visible Absorption Spectroscopy—All UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer at 20 °C using a bandwidth of 2 nm, a response time of 1 s, and a scan speed of 500 nm/min unless otherwise noted. For concentration calculations, the molar extinction coefficient value (ϵ500) for WT rhodopsin was taken to be 40 600 m-1 cm-1 (32Wald G. Brown P.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1953; 37: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The samples were photobleached in buffer A by illumination for 30 s (at a 6-Hz flash rate) with a Machine Vision Strobe light source (EG & G) equipped with a wavelength >490 nm long pass filter. This light treatment was found to be adequate for full conversion of all samples. The presence of a protonated Schiff base in the MII state for each mutant was verified by adding H2SO4 to a pH of 1.9 immediately following photobleaching then measuring the absorbance spectrum to assay the presence of a spectral species at 440 nm (which indicates an intact retinal protonated Schiff base) (33Sakamoto T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Photobleaching time course analysis on mutant Y268F was performed as above but with bleaching time reduced to 15 s, and results compared with a WT rhodopsin irradiated in the exact same manner.Determination of Transducin (GT) Activation Rates—Activation of GT by rhodopsin was monitored using fluorescence spectroscopy at 10 °C as described previously (34Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15498-15505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P.

Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) using a Photon Technologies QM-1 steady state fluorescence spectrophotometer (37Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was 295 nm (2-nm bandwidth), and fluorescence emission was monitored at 340 nm (12-nm bandwidth). Briefly, photobleached mutant rhodopsin (final concentration of 5 nm) was added to the reaction mixture consisting of 250 nmGT in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% DM. Thus the mixture was allowed to stir for 300 s; then the reaction was initiated by the addition of GTPγS to a final concentration of 5 μm, and the increase in fluorescence was followed for an additional 1500 s. To calculate the activation rates, the slopes of the initial fluorescence increase following GTPγS addition were determined through the data points covering the first 60 s using linear regression analysis. Mutant rhodopsin activation values were reported as percentages relative to WT, which was taken to be 100%.Thermal Bleaching of Rhodopsin Samples—Thermal decay rates were followed by UV-visible spectroscopy in buffer A essentially as described previously (28Janz J.M. Fay J.F. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16982-16991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 38Janz J.M. Farrens D.L. Vision Res. 2003; 43: 2991-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The thermal stability of each mutant was determined by first monitoring the absorbance of each sample from 650-250 nm at 1-min intervals at a given temperature. Thermal decay rates were subsequently obtained by monitoring the decrease of the 500 nm absorbing dark state species from these measurements over time (39Davidson F.F. Loewen P.C. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4029-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 40Andres A. Kosoy A. Garriga P. Manyosa J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5696-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 41Vogel R. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3529-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Baseline drift was corrected for by normalizing all spectra to an absorbance of zero at 650 nm. For E113Q, thermal decay rates were measured by monitoring the increase in tryptophan fluorescence at 330 nm, which was caused by the release of retinal from the chromophore-binding pocket (37Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) as described previously (28Janz J.M. Fay J.F. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16982-16991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 38Janz J.M. Farrens D.L. Vision Res. 2003; 43: 2991-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The experimental setup for these assays is similar to that of the retinal release assay (described below) except that the samples were not photobleached during the assay. All thermal decay data was analyzed using monoexponential decay (absorbance experiments) or monoexponential rise to maximum (fluorescence experiments) fitting algorithms in Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific Software). Ea values for mutant thermal decay assays were determined by applying the rate data to the Arrhenius equation: k = Ae-Ea/(RT), as described previously (28Janz J.M. Fay J.F. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16982-16991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Measurement of the Rate of Retinal Release and/or MII Decay by Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The MII stability was assessed by measuring the time course of retinal release coinciding with the rate of decay for the active MII state using the PTI fluorimeter described above. Each measurement was carried out using 100 μl of a 0.25 μm mutant sample in buffer A, and the sample temperature was maintained as described above. After the samples were photobleached to the MII state (see above), the retinal release measurements were carried out at the appropriate temperature by exciting the sample for 3 s (excitation wavelength = 295 nm, 1/4 nm bandwidth slit setting) and then blocking the excitation beam for 42 s to avoid further photobleaching the samples. Tryptophan fluorescence emission was monitored at 330 nm (12-nm bandwidth slit setting), and this cycle was repeated until a plateau in the signal was achieved. To determine the t12 values for retinal release, experimental data were analyzed using a monoexponential rise to maximum fit in Sigma Plot. In this manner series of MII decay rates were obtained at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C, and their rates were applied to the Arrhenius equation, k = Ae-Ea/(RT), to determine the Ea value of the retinal release process for each mutant rhodopsin.Hydroxylamine Reactivity—Hydroxylamine reactivity of the dark state was determined for purified WT and mutant rhodopsins by monitoring the rate of 500 nm absorbance decrease after the addition of hydroxylamine (pH 6.0) to the samples in buffer A to a final concentration of 50 mm at the indicated temperatures (28Janz J.M. Fay J.F. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16982-16991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 42Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3079-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Baseline drift was corrected as described above (see “Thermal Bleaching of Rhodopsin Samples”).Solvent Isotope Effects on Dark State Stability and MII Decay Rates—A 10% DM stock and a 500 mm MES (pH 6.0) stock buffer were made up fresh in deuterium oxide (D2O) and were then used to make a 0.05% DM, 5 mm MES (pH 6.0) (buffer D) D2O exchange buffer. The pH of the D2O experiments ranged between 6.0 and 6.4 because the pH for the deuterium buffer is expected to be off by + 0.4 pH units. However, as the process of MII decay has been shown to be independent over a pH range of 5.0-8.0 (38Janz J.M. Farrens D.L. Vision Res. 2003; 43: 2991-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), this slight pH change should not alter interpretation of the results. Using a concentrated stock of purified rhodopsin (to use a small volume for dilution) two equal molar stocks of both D2O and H2O rhodopsin were prepared. These samples (500 nm) were then buffer-exchanged using Millipore Ultrafree 0.5 centrifugal filter devices at low spin speeds. The D2O sample was washed eight times with 500 μl of D2O-containing buffer, whereas the H2O sample was washed in the exact same method using H2O buffer to ensure that any detergent concentration that may have taken place during the exchange was equal for both samples. The samples were then assayed for dark state thermal decay (55 and 37 °C) as well as MII decay rates at 20 °C as described above. The procedure was repeated and values were obtained from three separate experiments from two different stock preparations.Proton Inventory Studies on Dark State Retinal Stability and MII Decay/Retinal Release Rates—The stock solutions were prepared as described above and combined in various proportions to give different mole fractions (n) of deuterium ranging from 0-1.0. The dark state thermal decay rate or the MII decay rate of WT rhodopsin was monitored as described above over the range of different mole fractions of D2O. Data were analyzed by plotting the ratio of kn/kHversus the mole fraction of D2O, where kn is the rate in the molar fraction of D2O and kH is the rate in 100% H2O.RESULTSRational for Choice of Mutants—The site-directed rhodopsin mutants analyzed in this study were generated to assess their individual roles in maintaining retinal Schiff base integrity. Specifically, mutants were investigated to evaluate their role in a hydrogen bond network that has previously been proposed based on crystallographic data (23Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J.

Each mutant was designed to disrupt the hydrogen bond capability of that individual residue yet preserve the size of the amino acid side chain as much as possible. Toward this end, we made and analyzed the following series of retinal binding pocket mutants: T94I, E113Q, E181Q, S186A, Y192F, and Y268F (Fig. 1). Mutant T94I was investigated not only because of its potential role in this hydrogen bonding network but also because mutant T94I is associated with the disease congenital night blindness (44Ramon E. del Valle L.J. Garriga P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6427-6432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 45Gross A.K. Rao V.R. Oprian D.D.

All mutants exhibited spectral ratios (λ280/λmax) between 1.6 and 1.8 with the exception of the counter-ion mutant E113Q, which shows a pH dependence in its absorbance profile (42Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3079-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 43Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Many of the mutants exhibited shifted dark state absorption maximum values (λmax), (Fig. 2). Mutant T94I, which is in close proximity to the counter-ion residue Glu113, showed a λmax value of 478 nm in agreement with previous results (44Ramon E. del Valle L.J. Garriga P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6427-6432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 45Gross A.K. Rao V.R. Oprian D.D.

Interestingly, we also found that mutant T94I could be regenerated with all-trans-retinal, exhibiting a λmax = 464 nm as reported earlier (44Ramon E. del Valle L.J. Garriga P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6427-6432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Additionally, mutant E181Q showed a slight red shift in its absorbance profile (47Yan E.C.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3620-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas the dark state λmax of mutant S186A was similar to that of WT rhodopsin (24Yan E.C. Kazmi M.A. Ganim Z. Hou J.M.

Notably, the tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at residues 192 and 268 resulted in blue shifted λmax values in the dark state of 491 and 495 nm, respectively.Fig. 2UV-visible absorption profiles of purified rhodopsin hydrogen bond network mutants.

https://openalex.org/W1988682082,"The taxonomic diversity of ammonoids, in terms of the number of taxa preserved, provides an incomplete picture of the extinction pattern during the Permian because of a strongly biased fossil record. The analysis of morphological disparity (the variety of shell shapes) is a powerful complementary tool for testing hypotheses about the selectivity of extinction and permits the recognition of three distinct patterns. First, a trend of decreasing disparity, ranging for about 30 million years, led to a minimum disparity immediately before the Permian-Triassic boundary. Second, the strongly selective Capitanian crisis fits a model of background extinction driven by standard environmental changes. Third, the end-Permian mass extinction operated as a random, nonselective sorting of morphologies, which is consistent with a catastrophic cause."
https://openalex.org/W2165824042,"Staphylococcus aureus can utilize ferric hydroxamates as a source of iron under iron-restricted growth conditions. Proteins involved in this transport process are: FhuCBG, which encodes a traffic ATPase; FhuD2, a post-translationally modified lipoprotein that acts as a high affinity receptor at the cytoplasmic membrane for the efficient capture of ferric hydroxamates; and FhuD1, a protein with similarity to FhuD2. Gene duplication likely gave rise to fhuD1 and fhuD2. While the genomic locations of fhuCBG and fhuD2 in S. aureus strains are conserved, both the presence and the location of fhuD1 are variable. The apparent redundancy of FhuD1 led us to examine the role of this protein. We demonstrate that FhuD1 is expressed only under conditions of iron limitation through the regulatory activity of Fur. FhuD1 fractions with the cell membrane and binds hydroxamate siderophores but with lower affinity than FhuD2. Using small angle x-ray scattering, the solution structure of FhuD1 resembles that of FhuD2, and only a small conformational change is associated with ferrichrome binding. FhuD1, therefore, appears to be a receptor for ferric hydroxamates, like FhuD2. Our data to date suggest, however, that FhuD1 is redundant to FhuD2 and plays a minor role in hydroxamate transport. However, given the very real possibility that we have not yet identified the proper conditions where FhuD1 does provide an advantage over FhuD2, we anticipate that FhuD1 serves an enhanced role in the transport of untested hydroxamate siderophores and that it may play a prominent role during the growth of S. aureus in its natural environments.

With few exceptions, all bacteria have an absolute requirement for iron (1Posey J.E. Gherardini F.C. Science. 2000; 288: 1651-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 2Weinberg E.D. Perspect. Biol. Med. 1997; 40: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The amount of free, biologically relevant iron, however, is negligible at physiological pH (10-18m) (3Braun V. Hantke K. Köster W. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 1998; 35: 67-145PubMed Google Scholar). This is primarily caused by the rapid formation of iron(III)-hydroxy precipitates that are highly insoluble. In response to the stress generated from a low iron environment, many microorganisms secrete low molecular weight iron chelating compounds termed siderophores. Siderophores commonly bind ferric iron with extremely high affinities (4Byers B.R. Arceneaux E.L. Sigel A. Sigel H. Iron Transport and Storage in Microorganisms, Plants, and Animals. 35. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 37-66Google Scholar) and serve to solubilize iron from the biologically inert iron(III)-hydroxy precipitates. Typically, ferric-siderophores are mobilized across the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria expressing cognate outer membrane receptors, periplasmic-binding proteins, and associated ABC 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; MBP, maltose-binding protein.-type transporters (5Köster W.

In Gram-positive bacteria, ferric siderophores are captured by lipoproteins that function as high affinity receptors and subsequently feed ligand to the ABC transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane. The lipid group on these receptors acts as a tether to anchor the receptor protein to the external face of the cell membrane (7Sutcliffe I.C. Russell R.R.B. J.

The fifth gene involved in this transport system, fhuD1, is predicted to encode a protein with 50% total similarity to FhuD2. We showed that the fhuD1 gene product could partially compensate for the loss of the fhuD2 gene product (12Sebulsky M.T. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4994-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this communication, we show that the presence and location of fhuCBG and fhuD2 are strictly conserved in several S. aureus genomes. In contrast, the fhuD1 gene is mobile: it is absent in some strains and appears on a genomic island in others. The unusual occurrence of the fhuD1 gene warranted a detailed investigation of the function of the FhuD1 protein. Bacterial Strains and Growth Media—S. aureus RN6390 (16Peng H.L. Novick R.P. Kreiswirth B. Kornblum J. Schlievert P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4365-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) served as the wild-type staphylococcal strain in this study, and derivatives H430 (RN6390 fhuD1::Km), H364 (RN6390 fhuD2::Tet), and H295 (RN6390 fur::Km) have been previously described (12Sebulsky M.T.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4394-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α (Promega) was used for routine cloning and recombinant protein overexpression. For the routine cultivation of S. aureus, tryptic soy broth (Difco) was the chosen growth medium, and Luria-Bertani broth (Difco) was the selected medium for E. coli. Solid media were obtained by the addition of 1.5% (w/v) Bacto agar (Difco). S. aureus was grown in Tris-minimal succinate (TMS) medium supplemented with either FeCl3 (50 μm) or ethylenediamine-di(o-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid) (EDDHA) (1 μm) to create iron-replete and iron-restricted growth conditions, respectively. TMS was made as follows: 40 ml of a 25× Tris minimal salts stock (in 1 liter was dissolved 145 g of NaCl, 92.5 g of KCl, 27.5gofNH4Cl, 3.55 g of Na2SO4, 6.8gofKH2PO4) was added to 12.1 g of Tris base, 16.6 g of succinate, and 50 ml 20% casamino acids in ∼800 ml of water, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 prior to autoclaving. After autoclaving, 2 ml of tryptophan (10 mg/ml) and 1-ml volumes of cysteine (22 mg/ml), thiamine (16.9 mg/ml), nicotinic acid (1.23 mg/ml), pantothenic acid (0.5 mg/ml), biotin (0.01 mg/ml), MgCl2 (95.3 mg/ml), and CaCl2 (11.1 mg/ml) were incorporated and the volume adjusted to 1 liter with sterilized MilliQ water. When required, kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and tetracycline (4 μg/ml) were included in S. aureus growth medium. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml), when appropriate, was incorporated into medium for the growth of E. coli. Protein Overexpression and Purification—The fhuD1 gene, without the predicted signal sequence codons, was PCR-amplified as a 1.0-kb DNA fragment, digested with BamHI and EcoRI (sites were incorporated into the oligonucleotides) and then cloned into BamHI- and EcoRI-digested pGEX-2T-TEV (14Sebulsky M.T. Shilton B.H. Speziali C.D. Heinrichs D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49890-49900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pMTS78, from which a translational fusion between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and FhuD1 is encoded, was introduced into E. coli strain DH5α to generate strain H659. Strain H659 was grown to an approximate OD600 of 0.8, and, following the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm), growth was allowed to continue for 3 h before the cells were lysed. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 40000 × g to remove insoluble cellular components and then passed across a 5-ml GSTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) for purification. Once purified, the GST-FhuD1 fusion protein was cleaved by the TEV protease (4 h at 23 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) before it was applied to an 8-ml Mono-S column (Amersham Biosciences) and recovered using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. Generation of Polyclonal Antisera to FhuD1—The purified FhuD1 was used to generate polyclonal antisera in two New Zealand White rabbits (Charles River). Briefly, 100 μg of protein in Titer Max Gold adjuvant (Cedarlane) was injected subcutaneously into each rabbit. The rabbits were boosted with 50 μg of protein at 2–4 weeks, and at 5 weeks, the rabbits were sacrificed, and sera were collected. Sera were adsorbed three times over polyvinylidene difluoride-immobilized DH5α (pGEX-2T-TEV) cell lysate, induced to express glutathione S-transferase. Detergent Extraction and Phase Partitioning—S. aureus cells in late log-phase were collected, washed three times with 0.9% NaCl (w/v), and then equilibrated to an OD600 of 1.0. The cell wall was digested using lysostaphin (50 μg), followed by sonication to lyse cells. Triton X-114 phase partitioning was performed as previously described (14Sebulsky M.T. Shilton B.H. Speziali C.D. Heinrichs D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49890-49900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Before electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the detergent pellets were diluted 1:1 with water followed by the addition of sample loading buffer. Immunoblot Analysis—Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Washing and detection were performed using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. In all cases, the primary antibody was adsorbed polyclonal antisera raised against FhuD1 (typically diluted 1:15,000), and the secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat α-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) used at a 1:5000 dilution. FhuD1 Dissociation Constant (KD) Determinations—Fluorescence titration experiments were conducted using a Flourolog 3 spectrofluorometer (ISA Instruments.) Purified FhuD1 protein was used at a concentration of 8–16 nm, the reaction buffer was 2 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and the temperature was held constant at 23 °C. The excitation and emission slits were set at 1 and 10 nm, respectively, with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 283 and 348 nm, respectively. Dissociation constants (KD) were calculated as previously described (14Sebulsky M.T. Shilton B.H. Speziali C.D. Heinrichs D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49890-49900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Proteinase K Digests—The FhuD1 protein (2 μg) was mixed with ferric-siderophore and incubated at 55 °C for 30 min in the presence of proteinase K (2 μg per reaction). The reaction buffer was 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Samples were heated to 95 °C in sample loading buffer for 5 min and then examined by SDS-PAGE as described previously (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Siderophores—Ferrichrome was purchased from Sigma, desferrioxamine B (used as Desferal™ [Novartis]) was obtained from the London Health Sciences Centre, and aerobactin and coprogen were purchased from EMC microcollections GmbH (Tübingen, Germany). Pyoverdine was prepared by methods previously described (18Meyer J.M. Stintzi A. De Vos D. Cornelis P. Tappe R. Taraz K. Budzikiewicz H. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Siderophore Plate Bioassays—Siderophore plate bioassays were performed essentially as previously described (13Sebulsky M.T. Hohnstein D. Hunter M.D. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4394-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). 5-μl volumes of ferric siderophore solutions, at concentrations as indicated in Table II, were placed onto sterile 6-mm paper discs before being placed on agar plates containing impregnated bacteria. Bacteria were incorporated into the plates at a concentration of 1 × 104 cells/ml. Results were scored after incubation at 37 °C for 48 h followed by 24 h at room temperature.Table IIGrowth promoting ability of hydroxamate siderophores on S. aureusa Values in gray bars indicate concentration (in μm) of siderophore.b Represents mean diameter (in mm) of growth halo; discs are 6 mm. Open table in a new tab a Values in gray bars indicate concentration (in μm) of siderophore. b Represents mean diameter (in mm) of growth halo; discs are 6 mm. Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)—SAXS measurements for FhuD2 were carried out as previously described (14Sebulsky M.T. Shilton B.H. Speziali C.D. Heinrichs D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49890-49900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Measurements for FhuD1 were made at the Advanced Photon Source, Beamline ID-18, as follows: the sample temperature was 20 °C, and the protein solution was moved continuously through a 1-mm quartz capillary during the course of the measurement to minimize the effects of radiation damage. Data were collected at 1370 mm using a CCD detector, with X-rays at a wavelength of 1.03 Å, to cover the momentum transfer range 0.027 nm-1 < S < 0.60 nm-1, where S is defined as 2sinθ/λ (2θ is the scattering angle, while λ is the wavelength of the radiation). Note that Q, used in the Guinier plots, is defined as 4πsinθ/λ. For each sample, 5 10-s exposures were recorded that consisted of 3 measurements from the protein solution bracketed by 2 measurements of the buffer solution. Data were integrated using Fit2D (19Hammersley, A. P. (1998) ESRF Internal Report, ESRF97HA02T, Grenoble, FranceGoogle Scholar, 20Hammersley, A. P. (1997) ESRF Internal Report, ESRF97HA02T, Grenoble, FranceGoogle Scholar), and exported into a spreadsheet program. The three protein solution curves and two background buffer curves were inspected and averaged, and the background buffer curve was subtracted, with no correction, from the protein solution curve to yield scattering from the hydrated protein. In our previous work that described the properties of the FhuD2 protein in detail (14Sebulsky M.T. Shilton B.H. Speziali C.D. Heinrichs D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49890-49900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we showed that expression of FhuD2 was iron-regulated, that FhuD2 was amphiphilic and present in the cell membrane, and that purified FhuD2 bound ferric hydroxamates with dissociation constants in the nanomolar to micromolar range. The data suggested that the protein acts as a high affinity receptor for hydroxamate siderophores at the external face of the cytoplasmic membrane in S. aureus (12Sebulsky M.T. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4994-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Sebulsky M.T. Shilton B.H. Speziali C.D. Heinrichs D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49890-49900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In our initial genetic studies, however, we also identified a second gene, fhuD1, that was predicted to encode a protein with ∼50% similarity to FhuD2 (12Sebulsky M.T. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4994-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Examination of the phenotype of fhuD1 and fhuD2 knockout strains demonstrated that the fhuD1 gene product could partially compensate for the loss of fhuD2 in terms of the transport of hydroxamate siderophores. The following studies were undertaken to further characterize the function of FhuD1. Variable Occurrence of fhuD1 in S. aureus—The observation that FhuD1 is more similar in sequence to FhuD2 than to other FhuD homologs encoded from the genomes of other Gram-positive bacteria suggests that they arose from a gene duplication event at some point in the evolution of S. aureus. Seven S. aureus genome sequencing projects (either completed or in the process of completion) were analyzed for the presence of fhu genes: S. aureus NCTC 8325 (www.genome.ou.edu/staph.html), MRSA252 (21Holden M.T.

As illustrated in Fig. 1, A and B, fhuCBG and fhuD2 are present in the same genomic locations in all seven genomes. In contrast, fhuD1 is only present in five genomes (MW2, Mu50, NCTC8325, MSSA476, and COL) (Fig. 1C). In four of these genomes (MW2, COL, NCTC8325, and MSSA476), the fhuD1 gene is in a similar genomic location, while in the Mu50 genome the fhuD1 coding sequence was found on a genomic island referred to as SaGIm (22Kuroda M. Ohta T. Uchiyama I. Baba T. Yuzawa H. Kobayashi I. Cui L. Oguchi A. Aoki K. Nagai Y. Lian J. Ito T. Kanamori M. Matsumura H. Maruyama A. Murakami H. Hosoyama A. Mizutani-Ui Y. Takahashi N.K.

However, our analyses showed that SAV0812 encodes a secreted Von Willebrand factor-binding protein. The fhuD1 coding region is SAV0803, still within the SaGIm island. It is interesting to note that the presence of fhuD1 is correlated with the presence of the mw1944 homolog, encoding a predicted 283 amino acid protein with similarity to a methyl-transferase involved in tetracenomycin synthesis. The two genes are inserted between mw1943 and mw1946 homologs in MW2, NCTC8325, MSSA476, and COL, and are both absent from the equivalent genomic location in N315, Mu50, and MRSA252. Interestingly, mw1944-fhuD1 (between mw1943 and mw1946) is between a pathogenicity island, SaPIn1 (N315)/SaPIm1 (Mu50), and a bacteriophage, ΦN315/ΦMu50A, in the genomes of N315 and Mu50 (22Kuroda M.

The unusual location/occurrence of the fhuD1 gene within the genomes of S. aureus warranted a functional characterization of the fhuD1 gene product. S. aureus fhuD1 Encodes an Iron-regulated Lipoprotein— Late log phase cells of S. aureus RN6390 and derivatives were harvested by centrifugation after culture in either iron-replete or iron-restricted medium. Cells were subjected to Triton X-114 phase partitioning, a technique that separates cell components into three fractions: insoluble, aqueous, and detergent soluble (membrane-associated proteins are present within the latter fraction). In Fig. 2, we show that FhuD1 partitions with the detergent soluble fraction, indicating that the protein is amphipathic and associated with the membrane. Similar results using Triton X-114 fractionation have been obtained for several other lipoproteins (12Sebulsky M.T. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4994-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Cockayne A. Hill P.J. Powell N.B.L. Bishop K. Sims C. Williams P. Infect.

This result is consistent with the presence of a lipobox motif (15LTAC18) in FhuD1 (26Sutcliffe I.C. Harrington D.J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2065-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our results confirm that FhuD1, although primarily hydrophilic, resides within the detergent soluble membrane component of the cell. Expression of FhuD1 in the cell membrane was regulated by exogenous iron concentrations, since FhuD1 is only detected in cells grown in iron-starved medium, and this regulation is mediated by the activity of the Fur protein, because a fur mutant-expressed FhuD1 in the membrane of cells grows under iron-replete conditions (Fig. 2). No band is observed in the lane loaded with protein extracted from H430 (RN6390 fhuD1::Km) indicating that the antibody is specific for FhuD1 and does not cross-react with FhuD2. FhuD1 Binds Hydroxamate-type Siderophores but with Less Affinity Than FhuD2—Our previous studies identified a role for fhuD1 in ferric hydroxamate uptake since a fhuD2 knockout strain that expressed fhuD1 could still utilize ferric hydroxamates, albeit to a lesser extent than wild-type RN6390 (12Sebulsky M.T. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4994-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, since FhuD1 shares 50% total similarity with FhuD2 (12Sebulsky M.T. Heinrichs D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4994-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Sebulsky M.T. Shilton B.H. Speziali C.D. Heinrichs D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49890-49900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a protein that our group has characterized as a high affinity receptor for ferric hydroxamates (14Sebulsky M.T. Shilton B.H. Speziali C.D. Heinrichs D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49890-49900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we reasoned that FhuD1 is also a receptor for ferric hydroxamates. To investigate this further, and as an initial attempt to demonstrate that ferric hydroxamates physically interact with FhuD1, we examined in SDS-PAGE the reaction products of FhuD1 treated with proteinase K after incubation with various ferric siderophores (Fig. 3). We showed that the slowest migrating form of FhuD1 was protected from proteolysis when preincubated with either coprogen, Desferal™ or ferrichrome (Fig. 3, lanes 6–8, respectively), but not with aerobactin (Fig. 3, lane 5) or the pseudomonal siderophore pyoverdine (Fig. 3, lane 9); the latter siderophore does not promote the growth of S. aureus in biological assays. The identity of the faster migrating band in these experiments was not confirmed but is likely partially degraded FhuD1 as a result of incomplete proteolysis in the presence of some siderophores. In the presence of an appropriate ligand, it is assumed that FhuD1 adopts a conformation that is resistant to proteolytic degradation. As a more appropriate measure of ligand binding, we then used fluorescence spectroscopy to determine the affinity of FhuD1 for ferric hydroxamates, and the results are presented in Table I. Compared with FhuD2, FhuD1 has a marginally lower affinity for ferrichrome, Desferal™ and coprogen and a much lower affinity for aerobactin. The low affinity of FhuD1 for aerobactin is consistent with our observation that aerobactin does not protect FhuD1 from proteolysis (see Fig. 3).Table IDissociation constants of FhuD1 for ferric hydroxamate siderophoresProteinKDAerobactinDesferal™CoprogenFerrichromeμmFhuD1400.96.70.05FhuD2aS. aureus FhuD2.0.30.051.70.02FhuDbE. coli FhuD values have been previously reported (14, 31).0.4350.31.0a S. aureus FhuD2.b E. coli FhuD values have been previously reported (14Sebulsky M.T.

Their activity is controlled by two biochemical reactions, the GDP/GTP exchange and the GTP hydrolysis. The formation of the active GTP-bound state of the GTPase is accompanied by conformational changes of two regions (called switch I and II) that provide a platform for the selective interaction with effector proteins (5Vetter I.R.

Kinectin, which binds to kinesin and enhances its microtubule-dependent ATPase activity, has been shown to bind Rac1, Cdc42, RhoA, and RhoG in a GTP-dependent manner (18Hotta K. Tanaka K. Mino A.

Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar), implying that effector binding involves the switch regions of the GTPases. This is confirmed by the recent crystal structure of the complex between active RhoA and the Rho-binding domain (RBD) of ROCKI. ROCKI-RBD forms a parallel α-helical coiled-coil dimer and binds exclusively to the switch I and switch II regions of RhoA (6Dvorsky R. Blumenstein L. Vetter I.R. Ahmadian M.R. J. Biol.

The structure of PRK1-HR1a in complex with RhoA revealed that the HR1a domain forms an antiparallel coiled-coil (ACC) and is able to bind to two distinct surface sites of RhoA (33Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), one within and the other apart from the switch regions. An ACC-like structure has also been predicted for other HR1-containing proteins such as rhophilin and Rhotekin (33Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol.

The most common mechanism of effector activation by Rho GTPases appears to be the disruption of intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions to expose functional domains within the effector protein (9Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 21Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Although considerable progress has been made in elucidating physiological processes involving Rho effector signaling pathways, the molecular basis of RhoA interaction with its effectors has not been thoroughly characterized yet. In this study, we present binding constants for the interaction of individual effector RBDs with the active and inactive forms of RhoA determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. We also present data for two novel Rho-interacting domains of ROCKI, which tightly interact with RhoA but not with Rac1 and Cdc42. These data, together with the available structural data on PRK1 and ROCKI, make us propose a cooperative activation model for Rho effector kinases. Plasmids—Human RhoA (amino acids 1-181; accession number L25080); human PRK-HR1a-(1–106) (Q16512); HR1b-(122–199); human ROCKI-RBD-(947–1015) (U43195); ROCKI-RID-(842–931); ROCKI-HR1-(420–550); and mouse Rhotekin-HR1-(1–89) (U54638) were cloned in pGEX4T1 and pQE32 via BamHI/XhoI sites, respectively. Proteins—RhoA, PRK1-HR1a, PRK1-HR1b, ROCK-RBD, ROCK-RID, ROCK-HR1, and Rhotekin-HR1 were produced as glutathione S-transferase (GST) or His-tagged fusion proteins in Escherichia coli as described (36Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 189: 45-63PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were isolated by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. After thrombin cleavage and concentration with centrifugal concentrators (Vivaspin 5-, 10-, or 30-kDa molecular weight cut-off, Viva Science) the proteins were purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences) at a final purity of at least 95%. Rac1 and PAK157–141 were purified as described (37Haeusler L.C. Blumenstein L. Stege P. Dvorsky R. Ahmadian M.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Fiegen D.

His-tagged proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography (Qiagen) with subsequent concentration and size exclusion chromatography to a similar purity. The protein quality and the nucleotide binding capacity of RhoA were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and reversed-phase HPLC using a C-18 column (ODS-Hypersil, 5 μm, Bischoff) as described (36Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 189: 45-63PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm dithioerythritol, and 5 mm MgCl2. Protein masses were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Finnigan). The obtained molecular masses for the respective proteins corresponded to that calculated by the Genetics Computer Group program peptidesort (Madison, WI). Nucleotide Exchange—Nucleotide-free Rho proteins were prepared using enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) and phosphodiesterase (Sigma) at 4 °C as described previously for Ras (39John J. Rensland H. Schlichting I. Vetter I. Borasio G.D. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mantGDP- and mantGpp(NH)p-bound Rho proteins were prepared by mixing the nucleotide-free form of the respective proteins and the fluorescent nucleotides in a molar ratio of 1:1.5 and using prepacked gel filtration columns (NAP5, Amersham Biosciences) to remove unbound nucleotides. The concentrations of the nucleotide-bound proteins were determined by HPLC as described (36Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 189: 45-63PubMed Google Scholar). Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibition Measurements—The inhibition of the mantGDP or mantGpp(NH)p release from RhoA (0.2 μm) by increasing amounts of the respective effector domains (0.01–300 μm) in the presence of unlabeled nucleotide (40 μm) was monitored on a LS50B PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrofluorometer as described previously for Ras-Raf and Rac-PAK interactions (36Ahmadian M.R.

All measurements were carried out in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, and 5 mm dithiothreitol at 25 °C. The observed rate constants (kobs) were single exponentially fitted using the program Grafit (Erithacus software). The dependence of the observed rate constants on the effector concentration was fitted to yield the dissociation constant (Kd) as described (36Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Methods Mol.

Although these techniques have obviously been very valuable in identifying the binding partners in the first place, they do not provide any information about the affinity of the binding partners. Thus, our primary goal was to establish a method for the time-resolved detection and quantification of Rho-effector interactions. However, no fluorescence change could be observed upon mixing RhoA with the respective effector RBDs using various fluorescently labeled nucleotides or tryptophan fluorescence of the GTPase. The crystal structures of the RhoA·GTPγS·PRK1-HR1a (33Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and RhoA·Gpp(NH)p·ROCK-RBD complexes (6Dvorsky R. Blumenstein L. Vetter I.R. Ahmadian M.R. J. Biol.

Thus, we took advantage of the ability of effector domains (Fig. 1A) to inhibit the guanine nucleotide dissociation from the GTPase upon binding (so-called guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibition effect). This method, which provides a large fluorescence change upon the release of mant-nucleotide, has been successfully used for quantitative analysis of the effector interactions for Ras (40Herrmann C.

An incremental inhibition of the mantGpp(NH)p release from RhoA was observed when the measurements were carried out in the presence of a 200-fold excess of unlabelled Gpp(NH)p and increasing concentrations of effector RBDs. As shown in Fig. 1B, the nucleotide dissociation rate decreases with increasing ROCK-RBD concentrations. With the Rhotekin-HR1 and HR1a and HR1b of PRK1, we observed different degrees of nucleotide dissociation inhibition (data not shown). The dependence of the observed rate constant (kobs) on the concentration of the respective effector domains (Fig. 2, A–D), evaluated according to Herrmann et al. (40Herrmann C. Martin G.A.

Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To assess the GTP dependence of the RBD binding, we also determined the binding affinity of the respective effector domains for inactive RhoA using the effector-mediated inhibition effect on the mantGDP dissociation (Fig. 2, E–H). A comparison of the measured Kd values, which are summarized in Table I, indicates that Rhotekin exhibits the highest selectivity for the RhoA·GTP. A comparable GTP dependence of 2 orders of magnitude was reported previously for the Ras interaction with its effectors Raf kinase and RalGDS (40Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 41Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The strong preference of Rhotekin for the GTP-bound RhoA also justifies the usage of the Rhotekin-HR1 in GST pull down experiments to fish activated RhoA from cell lysates (28Reid T. Furuyashiki T.

However, it is important to note that the affinity of GST-Rhotekin-HR1 for RhoA·mantGpp(NH)p is reduced about 16-fold (0.15 μm; data not shown) due to steric hindrance of the 26-kDa GST anchor compared with the relatively small RBD (10 kDa). In contrast to Rhotekin, the GTP-dependent binding to RhoA is less pronounced for ROCK-RBD (10-fold) and PRK1-HR1a (4-fold) (Fig. 2 and Table I). The determined affinities for ROCK and PRK1 are comparable with what has been reported previously for the interaction of Cdc42 and the Rac isoforms with their effectors analyzed under equilibrium conditions using scintillation proximity assay, isothermal microcalorimetry, or fluorescence microscopy (37Haeusler L.C.

PRK1-HR1b exhibits preference for the GTP-bound form of RhoA, but the respective Kd values are only in the low micromolar range (Table I). Our data are in good agreement with the Kd values for the interaction of the HR1 domains of PRK1 with the constitutive active RhoAQ61L·GTP, recently reported by Owen et al. (34Owen D. Lowe P.N. Nietlispach D. Brosnan C.E. Chirgadze D.Y. Parker P.J. Blundell T.L. Mott H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50578-50587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).

PDILT is an unusual PDI relative that highlights the adaptability of chaperone and redox function in enzymes of the endoplasmic reticulum. Disulfide bond formation is an essential step in the folding of many secretory and cell surface proteins. Spontaneous formation of disulfide bonds is inefficient, and therefore, this process needs to be catalyzed by enzymes (1Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). One of these enzymes, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), 1The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription.1The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription. can transfer the disulfide bond between the two cysteines of its redox active site (CGHC) to substrate proteins and is required for co-translational folding of glycoproteins (2Bulleid N.J. Freedman R.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Reduced PDI is recharged by Ero1α,an FAD-dependent oxidoreductase that utilizes oxygen as its terminal electron acceptor (3Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 4Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar).PDI is part of the thioredoxin superfamily (6Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). PDI has two thioredoxin domains containing the active site (denoted a and a′) and two inactive domains (b and b′). Other PDI family members, including PDIp, ERp57, ERp72, and ERdj5 contain one or more of these modules (7Ferrari D.M. Soling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). PDI, ERp57, and ERp72 are ubiquitously expressed (8Marcus N. Shaffer D. Farrar P. Green M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1309: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but little is known about the in vivo activities or substrate specificity of other family members. In particular, the function of the recently identified PDI relatives ERp28 and ERp19 remains unclear.Some thioredoxin superfamily proteins of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin type are involved in redox reactions in other compartments of the eukaryotic cell, including the cytosol and mitochondria (9Chen Y. Cai J. Murphy T.J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33242-33248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Trotter E.W. Grant C.E. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Whereas Trx1 is responsible for keeping the cytosol in a reduced state, PDI enables proteins to become oxidized. The redox potential of a thioredoxin family protein indicates whether oxidation or reduction is favored, based on the relative preference of the CGHC motif to form a dithiol or a disulfide. However, work on the bacterial periplasmic disulfide bond catalysts DsbA and DsbC has shown that redox potentials do not necessarily predict redox function in vivo (11Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). DsbA and DsbC have comparable redox potentials of -120 and -130 mV, respectively, but whereas DsbA is the primary oxidant of the periplasm, DsbC is responsible for disulfide isomerization. Dimerization of DsbC (and its interaction with DsbD) is a critical factor in its ability to act as an isomerase (12Haebel P.W. Goldstone D. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Metcalf P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4774-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The local redox microenvironment, governed by other proteins, oligomeric status, and small molecular weight thiols such as glutathione, determines in vivo oxidoreductase activity both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Relating in vitro experiments to their in vivo context is, therefore, an important challenge in this area of biochemistry.PDI not only introduces disulfide bonds into substrates but can also rearrange existing ones. Mutational analysis has shown that both cysteines in the redox active site of PDI are required for disulfide bond formation but that the N-terminal cysteine of this motif is sufficient for isomerization (13Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). There has been considerable debate about the relative importance of the oxidase, isomerase, and reductase functions of PDI in vivo (14LaMantia M.L. Lennarz W.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Laboissiere M.C. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27975-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This assessment is complicated by redundancy, as many of the PDI homologues in yeast and mammals can partially complement PDI function.Recently, the number of PDI family members has grown, and it has become clear that the WCGHC motif is not invariant (17Clissold P.M. Bicknell R. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ERp44 and the yeast Eug1p are examples of thioredoxin-domain proteins that contain non-classical CXXS motifs. Eug1p is a poor oxidase and isomerase when assayed in vitro but can support these functions when the CXXS motif is mutated to CXXC (18Norgaard P. Winther J.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). SXXC thioredoxin proteins have been identified in bacteria, but none has been characterized biochemically (19Fomenko D.E. Gladyshev V.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11214-11225Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). No expressed eukaryotic SXXC motif proteins have so far been identified and studied.In this paper we describe for the first time a eukaryotic SXXC motif protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. This protein is a testis-specific, glycosylated, divergent eukaryotic PDI that contains an SXXS and an SXXC motif within its two thioredoxin domains. We have named this protein PDILT (protein disulfide isomerase-like protein of the testis). PDILT forms specific complexes with the oxidoreductase Ero1α and engages in disulfide-dependent interactions in the endoplasmic reticulum of testicular cells. The ability of PDILT to sustain these protein-protein complexes without a CXXC motif demonstrates that upstream active site cysteines are not necessary for a PDI-like protein to detect an oxidoreductase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Tissues, and Antibodies—Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, human MelJuSo cells, human embryonal kidney HEK293 cells, murine spermatogonia-like GC-1 cells (gift from P. Saunders), and rat Sertoli SK-11 cells (gift from R. Ivell) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). SK-11 cells were propagated at 33 °C. Human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). All media were supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mm glutamax, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). All cell lines were kept at 5% CO2.Tissue samples were obtained from male Balb/c or CD1 mice. The polyclonal rabbit anti-sera against PDI (20Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and polyclonal Ero1α (D5) (21Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) have been described. The antiserum against PDILT was raised against peptide RQKLINDSTNKQELNC and was a kind gift of Dr. L. Ellgaard. The antiserum against ERp57 was a kind gift of Prof. N. Bulleid. The calnexin antiserum was a kind gift from Prof. I. Braakman. Polyclonal antisera against BiP (Santa Cruz) and ERp72 (Calbiochem) and the anti-Myc antibody clone 9B11 (New England Biolabs) were commercially available.Transfections—Transfections with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sub-confluent cells in 6-cm dishes were washed twice with PBS (Invitrogen) and transfected with 1 μg of DNA for 6 h in the presence of Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Invitrogen). After 6 h the medium was replaced with complete medium, and the cells were analyzed 24 h post-transfection.RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA from cell lines and mouse tissues was extracted using Tri reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Before performing RT-PCR, RNA concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry to ensure equal total RNA input (typically 50 ng per reaction). RT-PCR reactions were performed using the AccessQuick kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol on a Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research). Primers for PDILT were designed to detect human, mouse, and rat homologues: catcgttggcttcttccag (exon 4) and tattttggaatctcttcactgg (exon 9). The control actin primers were ccacaccttctacaatgagc and actcctgcttgctgatccac. The resultant PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels.Construction of PDILT and Myc-tagged PDILT Vectors—The original cDNA was obtained from the IMAGE consortium. The PDILT cDNA was cloned into the BamHI/NotI restriction site of pcDNA3 and verified by DNA sequencing. The PDILT sequence corresponds to gi:28372543 and differs by three amino acids from gi:21757251.To create a Myc-tagged version of PDILT, fusion PCR was used to insert a Myc tag between amino acids Q574 and K575 of PDILT, upstream of the KEEL sequence. In a first PCR round, fragments of the 5′ part of PDILT with a 3′ Myc tag and a 3′ part of PDILT with a 5′ Myc tag were generated. These two fragments were used in a second round PCR to generate PDILT-Myc using the extreme 5′ and 3′ primers and the Myc overlap from both first round PCR fragments.In Vitro Transcription—In vitro transcription of pcDNA3 PDILT constructs was performed using 5 μg of DNA linearized with MluI. T7 RNA polymerase-driven transcription reactions were performed using the Promega riboprobe system, according to manufacturer's instructions.Metabolic Labeling—All procedures were at 37 °C unless otherwise stated. Cells in 6-cm dishes were starved for 20 min in minimum Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cysteine (ICN) but supplemented with 2 mm glutamax and 20 mm Hepes. Cells were biosynthetically labeled with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min. For pulse-labeling, the pulse was stopped by washing the cells twice with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mm NEM to trap disulfide-linked complexes. For pulse-chase, cells were washed once after the pulse with complete growth medium supplemented with 5 mm cysteine and methionine and 1 mm cycloheximide (chase medium) and then maintained in chase medium for the indicated times. Pulse-chased cells were then treated as for pulse-only cells. All cells were lysed at 4 °C in 300 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) supplemented with freshly added 20 mm NEM and 10 μg/ml protease inhibitors (chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and antipain; Sigma). Post-nuclear supernatants were generated by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and subjected to immunoprecipitation at 4 °C for 1 h using antibodies immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer before boiling for 5 min in sample buffer in the presence or absence of 50 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were subsequently analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE.Western Blotting—Post-nuclear cell lysates or comparable amounts of mouse tissues were directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE or subjected to immunoprecipitation before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) at 150 mA for 2 h, and the membranes were blocked in 8% milk, Tris-buffered saline Tween for 30 min. The primary anti-Myc, anti-Ero1α, anti-ERp57, anti-calnexin, anti-ERp72, and PDI antibodies were used at 1:1000, anti-PDILT was used at 1:333, and anti-BiP was used at 1:100 dilution. After washing 3 times with Tris-buffered saline Tween, membranes were incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies (DAKO) at a 1:2500 dilution for 1 h, washed extensively, and visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Protein markers were from Bio-Rad.Endoglycosidase H Treatment—Post-nuclear supernatants were subjected to endoglycosidase H treatment according to the manufacturers protocol (New England Biolabs). Briefly, β2-mercaptoethanol-reduced SDS-denatured samples were incubated in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, for 10 h at 37 °C and taken up into sample buffer before analysis by 8% SDS-PAGE.Confocal Microscopy—Transfected HeLa cells were grown on coverslips (VWR) and washed twice in PBS before fixing in ice-cold methanol for 10 min. The coverslips were blocked in 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min and then incubated with primary antibodies in 0.2% bovine serum albumin, PBS for 1 h. After washing twice in PBS, the coverslips were incubated with the relevant TRITC- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO). Finally, the coverslips were washed twice in PBS before mounting with Vectashield (Vector laboratories) and analyzed with a Zeiss laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510 META).RESULTSIdentification of a Novel PDI Relative with an Unusual Active Site Motif—The function and specificity of many PDI homologues in the mammalian ER is not fully understood. We were particularly interested in investigating the importance of the PDI CGHC motif for partner/substrate selection and redox control. We set about identifying putative uncharacterized PDI proteins to help us understand this motif in more detail. When PDI was used as an input sequence, the BLAST search engine (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) readily identified known PDI homologues including PDIp, ERdj5, ERp57, Erp72, P5, PDIR, and ERp44. We also identified a number of interesting, uncharacterized sequences that were closely related to PDI. One of these was the hypothetical protein gi:28372543/gi:21757251 (abbreviated to GI28/21). GI28/21 shared 27% identity (48% similarity) with PDI and occupied a distinct branch of the PDI family tree (Fig. 1A). Orthologues of this hypothetical human protein can be found in several other species (Fig. 1B). Direct homologues of GI28/21 were not found in other non-vertebrate genomes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), and Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress).Fig. 1Sequence of a novel human PDI-related protein.A, phylogram of a selection of PDI-related sequences obtained from the NCBI BLAST search engine. Hypothetical proteins are indicated by their gi number.

Note that the G. gallus sequence used to draw the phylogram is not full-length but contains the SXXS/SXXC motifs characteristic for the human protein. Other sequences are novel predicted genes. C, sequence alignment of PDI with the hypothetical protein gi:28372543. The thioredoxin-domain active sites of PDI and the corresponding SKQS/SKKC motifs of gi:28372543 are boxed. The KDEL sequences are underlined. D, exon-intron structure of gi:28372543 and PDI. PDI exons 1-11 correspond to PDILT exons 2-12. The arrangement of the exons is similar, except that gi:28372543 initiates translation from exon 2. The positions of the nucleotide regions coding for the CXXC motifs are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GI28/21 has two predicted thioredoxin domains between amino acids 42-153 and 389-493, corresponding to the a and a′ domains of PDI, respectively. Notably, GI28/21 lacks the two classical redox-active CXXC motifs of PDI within the thioredoxin domains. Instead, GI28/21 has an SSKQS sequence that aligns with the WCGHC PDI a domain and a WSKKC sequence that aligns with the PDI a′ domain (Fig. 1C). The a′ domain is most strongly conserved between PDI and GI28/21, sharing 48% identity. In addition, GI28/21 has a short N-terminal insertion and a C-terminal extension, giving rise to a putative 67-kDa protein, ∼10 kDa larger than PDI itself. These additional sequences have no homology with other known proteins. Furthermore, GI28/21 contains a C-terminal KEEL sequence likely to function in ER retention/retrieval and nine putative glycosylation sites. A signal peptide was predicted by the Signal P prediction server (22Bendtsen J.D. von Nielsen H. Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5606) Google Scholar).A database analysis of the exon-intron structure of GI28/21 (www.ensembl.org) suggested that it was not a pseudogene and had 12 exons, initiating in exon 2, but otherwise with a similar overall exon structure to PDI (Fig. 1D). GI28/21, thus, represents a gene with a b′ domain that is more closely related to PDI than ERp57 or ERp72 but with very different predicted “active site” residues. Given the representation of GI28/21 in different EST databases, its predicted expression in other species, and its unusual thioredoxin motifs, we extensively characterized GI28/21.GI28/21 mRNA Is Specifically Expressed in the Testis—Most mammalian PDI family members are widely, if not ubiquitously expressed. To establish whether and where GI28/21 was expressed, we designed GI28/21-specific primers spanning exons 4-9 and used RT-PCR to detect any GI28/21 mRNA. First, we verified the assay. RT-PCR was performed on DNase-treated, in vitro transcribed mRNA (derived from GI128/21 cDNA). The RT-PCR gave a product of the expected size only in the presence of reverse transcriptase (Fig. 2A). This showed that the PCR product was derived from GI128/21 mRNA and not from any contaminating cDNA. Next, RNA extracted from a panel of different mouse tissues was used in an RT-PCR experiment to investigate the tissue-specific expression of GI28/21 (Fig. 2B). Of all tissues examined, only RNA extracted from the testis gave a product (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Actin was used as a positive control to demonstrate equal RNA input (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Note that no product was obtained when the reverse transcriptase was omitted from the reaction (Fig. 2B, last lane).Fig. 2PDILT is specifically expressed in the testis.A, RT-PCR using primers specific for gi:28372543 was performed on in vitro transcribed, DNase-treated mRNA. An mRNA specific product of the expected size (624 base pairs) was obtained. B, RT-PCR on RNA extracted from various mouse tissues using gi:28372543-specific primers (upper panel) and actin primers as a positive control (lower panel). gi:28372543 mRNA was only expressed in the testis. C, RT-PCR on RNA extracted from HT1080, SK-11, and GC-1 cell lines using gi:28372543 and actin primers (upper and lower panels, respectively). The RT-PCR on testis RNA serves as a positive control. Expression of gi:28372543 could not be detected in the cell lines tested.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Several human cell lines were negative when screened for GI28/21 expression, including HT1080 (Fig. 2C), HeLa, HEK293, and MelJuSo cells (data not shown). Neither the testis-derived Sertoli SK11 cells nor the spermatogonia-like GC-1 cells expressed GI28/21 (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrated that GI28/21 was genuinely expressed but was restricted to testis. The absence of GI28/21 in SK11 cells and GC-1 cells suggested either that it may be expressed in a small subset of testicular cells or that expression was switched off in immortalized cell monolayers. Because of its similarity to PDI, we have named the protein PDILT (protein disulfide isomerase-like protein of the testis).PDILT Is a Glycosylated ER Resident Protein—The predicted signal peptide and the C-terminal KEEL sequence suggest that PDILT is an ER resident protein. Because no cell lines expressing endogenous PDILT are available, we created a Myc-tagged construct to ask whether PDILT was indeed localized to the ER. To ensure that the Myc tag did interfere with PDILT behavior, we used in vitro translation experiments with semi-permeabilized cells. The behavior of the tagged and untagged translation products was identical, except for the expected difference in molecular weight (not shown, but also see Fig. 5). To determine the intracellular localization of PDILT-Myc, HeLa cells were transfected with constructs encoding PDILT-Myc and the known ER resident protein Ero1α (Fig. 3A, upper panel) or with PDILT-Myc alone (Fig. 3A, lower panel) and were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Immunostaining for PDILT-Myc showed a reticular pattern characteristic of the ER (Fig. 3A, left). Both Ero1α and endogenous PDI exhibited a similar distribution pattern (Fig. 3A, middle) and co-localized with PDILT-Myc in the ER (Fig. 3A, right).Fig. 3PDILT is an ER resident glycoprotein.A, HeLa cells transfected with PDILT-Myc and Ero1α (top panel) or PDILT-Myc (bottom panel) were fixed in methanol and analyzed by confocal microscopy after immuno-staining with αMyc and D5 (αEro1α; top panel) or αMyc and αPDI (bottom panel). Single channel images for each staining are shown in the left and middle panels; the overlay in the right panels shows co-localization in yellow. Both PDI and Ero1α co-localize with PDILT in the ER. B, lysates of HeLa PDILT-Myc transfectants were digested or mock digested with endoglycosidase H (endo H) and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. PDILT is fully digested by endoglycosidase H and is, therefore, resident in the ER. WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further demonstrate that PDILT was an ER resident protein, we took advantage of the fact that PDILT has nine putative glycosylation sites (NX(S/T), which could potentially be modified upon translocation into the ER. To determine the glycosylation status of PDILT, lysates were treated with endoglycosidase H. Endoglycosidase H digests immature N-glycans but is unable to remove these sugars once they have been modified in the Golgi. Lysates of HeLa cells transfected with PDILT-Myc were subjected to endoglycosidase H digestion and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Endoglycosidase H digestion results in an increased mobility of the entire pool of PDILT-Myc from ∼76 kDa to around 65 kDa (Fig. 3B). The 65-kDa band corresponds to the predicted molecular mass of the mature PDILT-Myc protein without its signal sequence. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PDILT is an ER resident glycoprotein.PDILT Forms Intermolecular, Disulfide-dependent Complexes during Its Biosynthesis and at Steady State—PDI forms transient intermolecular bonds with substrate proteins and with the disulfide donor Ero1α (20Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether PDILT also engages in disulfide-bonded complexes, we performed pulse-chase and Western-blotting experiments. HeLa cells mock-transfected or transfected with PDILT-Myc were metabolically labeled or labeled and chased for the indicated times and lysed in the presence of NEM to trap any disulfide-bonded intermediates. Post-nuclear supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with αMyc and analyzed by non-reducing (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-5) or reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A, lanes 6-10). PDILT-Myc clearly had a relatively long half-life in HeLa cells of ∼24 h. The monomeric form of PDILT-Myc resolved as several discrete bands, probably because of variable usage of glycosylation sites in HeLa cells.Fig. 4PDILT forms intermolecular disulfide-bonded complexes.A, HeLa cells mock transfected (-) or transfected with PDILT-Myc were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min without (chase 0) or with a 30-, 60-, and 240-min chase. Cells were lysed in the presence of NEM followed by immunoprecipitation (IP) with αMyc. Immunoprecipitations were analyzed by 8% non-reducing (NR, lanes 1-5) or reducing (R, lanes 6-10) SDS-PAGE. PDILT forms intermolecular (*) but not intramolecular disulfide-dependent complexes during biosynthesis. B, HeLa cells transfected with PDILT-Myc were lysed in the presence of NEM and analyzed by 8% reducing (R) or non-reducing (NR) SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (WB). Excess NEM was added after reduction of the reduced sample (R) to prevent in-gel diffusion of excess dithiothreitol. PDILT forms intermolecular (*) but not intramolecular disulfide-dependent complexes at steady state.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds makes proteins more compact and causes them to migrate more rapidly in non-reducing gels compared with reducing gels. No changes in the migration of the monomeric PDILT-Myc were observed, suggesting that the solitary non-thioredoxin domain cysteine at position 135 does not form an intramolecular disulfide with the C-terminal cysteine of the a′ domain SXXC motif.Anti-Myc immunoprecipitations analyzed under non-reducing conditions showed some higher molecular weight complexes in addition to the monomeric PDILT-Myc (Fig. 4A, lanes 2-5). These complexes disappeared when the samples were reduced with dithiothreitol, demonstrating that PDILT-Myc engaged in disulfide-dependent intermolecular linkages with other proteins.

Glycosyltransferase A (GTA) uses UDP-GalNAc as a donor to transfer a monosaccharide residue to Fucα1-2Galβ-R (H)-terminating acceptors. Similarly, glycosyltransferase B (GTB) catalyzes the transfer of a monosaccharide residue from UDP-Gal to the same acceptors. These are highly homologous enzymes differing in only four of 354 amino acids, Arg/Gly-176, Gly/Ser-235, Leu/Met-266, and Gly/Ala-268. Blood group O usually stems from the expression of truncated inactive forms of GTA or GTB. Recently, an O2 enzyme was discovered that was a full-length form of GTA with three mutations, P74S, R176G, and G268R. We showed previously that the R176G mutation increased catalytic activity with minor effects on substrate binding. Enzyme kinetics and high resolution structural studies of mutant enzymes based on the O2 blood group transferase reveal that whereas the P74S mutation in the stem region of the protein does not appear to play a role in enzyme inactivation, the G268R mutation completely blocks the donor GalNAc-binding site leaving the acceptor binding site unaffected.

The human A and B blood groups are produced by two closely related glycosyltransferase enzymes (1Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S.

EC 2.4.1.40) that transfers GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to Fucα1-2Galβ-R (H)-terminating acceptors producing the A antigen GalNAcα1-3[Fucα1-2]Galβ-R. The B-synthesizing α1-3 galactosyltransferase (GTB, EC 2.4.1.37) transfers Gal from UDP-Gal to the same acceptors, producing the B antigen Galα1-3[Fucα1-2]Galβ-R. Individuals with blood type O do not express enzymes capable of modifying the H antigen (1Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). GTA and GTB exhibit characteristic mammalian glycosyltransferase topologies; they are type II integral membrane proteins with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a proteolytically sensitive stem region, and a catalytic domain (4Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GTA and GTB are highly homologous enzymes differing in only 4 of 354 amino acids, Arg/Gly-176, Gly/Ser-235, Leu/Met-266, and Gly/Ala-268 (1Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 5Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19257-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of these four critical amino acids converts the donor specificity from that of GTA to that of GTB. Recently, single crystal x-ray diffraction studies of soluble forms of GTA and GTB in complex with H acceptor and UDP have provided a structural basis for substrate recognition (6Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The critical residue Leu/Met-266 dominates donor selection with Gly/Ala-268 having a significant but lesser effect. The origin of blood group O was initially shown to be a deletion or mutation in the GTA or GTB gene that gave inactive truncated enzyme (1Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). More recently, an O2 enzyme (O03) was discovered that was a full-length form of GTA with three substitutions, P74S, R176G, and G268R (7Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Hakomori S. Bromilow I.M.

Carneiro F. Clausen H. Vox Sang. 2000; 79: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since the P74S mutation is distant from the active site and the R176G mutation in GTA increases enzyme turnover (10Seto N.O.L. Palcic M.M. Hindsgaul O. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14133-14138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it is presumably the replacement of glycine with arginine at position 268 that adversely affects enzyme activity (6Patenaude S.I.

For comparison, we also report the structure of the GTA R176G mutant enzyme, which was earlier shown to have an enzyme turnover rate greater than that of wild-type GTA (10Seto N.O.L. Palcic M.M.

All chimeric GTA/GTB enzymes are referred to by a series of four letters corresponding to the origin of each of the four residues where AAAA is GTA and BBBB is GTB. We reported earlier the interesting kinetics and donor specificity of the chimeric enzyme BAAA (aa 54-354, Gly-176, Gly-235, Leu-266, Gly-268) (10Seto N.O.L. Palcic M.M. Hindsgaul O. Bundle D.R.

Truncation of a further 10 amino acids from the N terminus gave higher expression levels and solubility; therefore, all mutants in this study are derived from wild-type GTA and GTB enzymes (both corresponding to aa 63-354). Cloning of GTA Arg-176 —GTA R176, also denoted as BAAA (aa 63-354), was made by PCR amplification using the BAAA (aa 54-354) gene as template together with the forward primer MIN-2 (5′-A TAT GAATTC ATG GTT TCC CTG CCG CGT ATG GTT TAC CCG CAG CCG AA), which introduced an EcoRI site (underlined) in the 5′ end, and the reverse primer PCR-3B (5′-ATA ATT AAGCTT CTA TCA CGG GTT ACG AAC AGC CTG GTG GTT TTT), which introduced a HindIII site (underlined) in the 3′ end. The following PCR profile was used for the construction of all the clones: 94 °C, 3 min (94 °C, 30 s, 55 °C, 30 s, 72 °C, 1 min) for 30 cycles. After gel purification, the PCR products were digested with EcoRI and HindIII for 2 h at 37 °C and were ligated into pCWΔlac vector (17Gegner J.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) opened with EcoRI/HindIII for 1 h at room temperature. Each ligation was transformed into BL21 competent cells (Novagen). All insert and plasmid purifications were made by Qiagen Plasmid Purification System (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). All ligations were made by the use of T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) at room temperature overnight. The clones were characterized by triplicate DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding region. Cloning of BAAA P74S—The BAAA P74S mutant was constructed by PCR using BAAA (aa 63-354) described above as a template and the forward primer HJL01 (5′-A TAT GAA TTC ATG GTT TCC CTG CCG CGT ATG GTT TAC CCG CAG TCC AAA GTT CTG ACC CCA TGC CG-3′), which was designed with a single codon substitution (CCG → TCC) at codon 74 and an EcoRI site at the 5′ end and the reverse primer PCR-3B. The amplified genes were digested by restriction enzymes (EcoRI and HindIII) and cloned as described above. Cloning of BAAA G268R—The BAAA G268R mutant was constructed by recombinant PCR using the BAAA (aa 63-354) clone as a template. The first PCR was performed using the outside forward primer MIN2 together with the internal reverse primer HJL02 (5′-ACC GAA GAA ACG ACC CAG GTA GTA GAA GTC ACC-3′) that contains a single codon substitution (ACC → AGC) at codon 268. A second PCR was performed using the internal forward primer HJL03 (5′-C CTG GGT CGT TTC TTC GGT GGT TCC GTT CAG-3′) that contains a single codon substitution (GGT → CGT) at codon 268 together with the outside reverse primer PCR-3B. The outside forward and reverse primers included the EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites. The two overlapping PCR products were annealed together and amplified by PCR with the outside primers MIN2 and PCR-3B, digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and cloned as described above. Cloning of P74S/G268R—The BAAA P74S/G268R mutant was constructed by PCR using the BAAA G268R clone as a template together with the forward primer HJL01 and the reverse primer PCR-3B. The amplified gene was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and HindIII and cloned as described above. Protein Purification—Mutant enzymes were purified from E. coli as described previously (18Seto N.O.L. Compston C.A. Szpacenko A. Palcic M.M. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 324: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Marcus S.L. Polakowski R. Seto N.O.L. Leinala E. Borisova S. Blancher A. Roubinet F. Evans S.V. Palcic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12403-12405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Expression levels for all of the mutants were good, and the yields of final purified proteins ranged from 26 mg/liter for the G268R mutant to 108 mg/liter for the P74S/G268R double mutant. Protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit based on the Bradford method (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine γ-globulin as a standard. Kinetic Characterization—Kinetic characterizations were carried out on all mutant enzymes using a Sep-Pak radiochemical assay with the hydrophobic acceptor Fucα1-2Galβ-O(CH2)7CH3 (21Palcic M.M. Heerze L.D. Pierce M. Hindsgaul O. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out at 37 °C in a total volume of 15 μl containing substrates and enzyme in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, with 20 mm MnCl2 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Seven different concentrations of the donor or acceptor were used, at a high concentration of the alternate substrate. The amount of substrate consumed was less than 15% to ensure linear initial reaction rates. The kinetic parameters Vmax and Km were derived from the best fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation by using nonlinear regression with the GraphPad PRISM 3.0 program. Crystallography—All mutants related to O2 enzyme were crystallized using conditions similar to the native GTA and GTB enzymes (6Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Data were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS4++ area detector at distances of 72 and 100 mm and exposure times between 4.0 and 5.0 min for 0.5° oscillations. X-rays were produced by an MM-002 generator (Rigaku/MSC) coupled to Osmic “Blue” confocal x-ray mirrors with power levels of 30 watts (Osmic). The crystals were frozen and maintained under cryogenic conditions at a temperature of -160 °C using a CryoStream 700 crystal cooler (Oxford). All structures were solved by using molecular replacement techniques with wild-type GTA or GTB (Protein Data Bank accession codes 1LZ0 and 1LZ7, respectively) as a starting model and were subsequently refined using the program CNS (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Graphics. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). In this study, a series of mutant blood group glycosyltransferases were produced and characterized to determine the effect of each modification on enzyme structure and function. These mutants are based on the gene sequence for an O2 enzyme discovered in blood banking laboratories that yields a triple mutant of GTA with arginine 176 replaced with glycine, proline 74 replaced with serine, and glycine 268 replaced with arginine. These enzymes were all cloned as soluble truncated proteins (aa 64-354) of the catalytic domain and expressed in E. coli. The purification by successive ion-exchange and affinity chromatography on a donor-based UDP-hexanolamine resin was straightforward for all constructs, suggesting no impairment of UDP binding. Kinetic constants were determined for each purified enzyme at a high concentration of the alternate substrate (Table I). The kcat for BAAA enzyme (R176G) was larger than that of wild-type GTA, consistent with our report for an enzyme with the same mutation but with 10 additional amino acids on the N terminus (10Seto N.O.L.

Except for the P74S mutant, which was comparable with that of the wild-type GTA, the purified enzymes with mutations corresponding to the human glycosyltransferase O2 showed very low activity. The kcat for the G268R mutant was 4 × 104 times less than that of GTA and 3.3 × 104 times less than that of the P74S mutant. The P74S/G268R mutant showed the lowest activity of all, with a kcat of only 3.4 × 10-5 s-1.Table IKinetic constants for mutant glycosyltransferasesEnzymeKAaKA is the Michaelis-Menten constant Km for the acceptor (Fuca1-2Galβ-O-(CH2)7CH3) determined at 1 mm donor.KBbKB is the Michaelis-Menten constant Km for the donor UDP-GalNAc determined at high concentrations of acceptor 0.4-0.8 mm.kcatkcat/KAkcat/KBμmμms-1mm-1s-1mm-1s-1AAAA (GTA)cData are from Ref. 19.9.98.717.517702010BAAA (R176G)dThe name BAAA indicates that the first critical residue on GTA (Arg-176) has been mutated to the corresponding residue in GTB (Gly).48354810001370BAAA P74SeAll mutations were based on the BAAA clone as a template.7511014.6195133BAAA G268R1577000.000440.00280.00063BAAA P74S/G268R4223000.0000340.000810.000015a KA is the Michaelis-Menten constant Km for the acceptor (Fuca1-2Galβ-O-(CH2)7CH3) determined at 1 mm donor.b KB is the Michaelis-Menten constant Km for the donor UDP-GalNAc determined at high concentrations of acceptor 0.4-0.8 mm.c Data are from Ref. 19Marcus S.L.

Open table in a new tab The O2 mutant enzymes also showed an increase in the Km values for both acceptor and donor (listed in Table I as KA and KB, respectively) over the wild-type GTA and the BAAA enzymes. For the P74S mutant, the Km for donor was 7-fold higher than GTA, whereas the effect on acceptor was less. The P74S/G268R mutant showed a large increase in Km for donor and a minor effect on acceptor Km (Table I). The presence of even these low turnover numbers suggests that the observed activity arises from either the target mutant enzyme or revertants (24Ly H.D. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 487-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar); the observation of an elevated donor Km suggests that the activity that is observed is not due to wild-type enzyme. Details of the data collection and refinement results for the enzymes in the unliganded and liganded forms are shown in Tables II and III, respectively.

Open table in a new tab In this report, the catalytic domain corresponding to the human blood group O2 glycosyltransferase was produced and characterized. The O2 enzyme is a triple mutant of GTA with arginine 176 replaced with glycine, proline 74 replaced with serine, and glycine 268 replaced with arginine. Except for the P74S mutant, the purified mutants for human glycosyltransferase O2 from E. coli showed very low enzymatic activity. To determine the effect of each mutation on the transferase activity, three mutants (P74S, G268R, and P74S/G268R) derived from BAAA were prepared, purified, and analyzed by enzyme kinetics and single crystal x-ray diffraction. All enzymes were mutated from and compared with the BAAA “super-A” enzyme, which has higher A activity than the wild-type. The crystal structure of the BAAA mutant (not shown) unfortunately does not reveal any details as to why this mutant shows significantly increased A activity, as next to the R176G mutation site lies a polypeptide loop adjacent to the active site of the enzyme that is observed to be disordered in almost every GTA/GTB native and mutant enzyme structure. The crystal structure of both enzymes containing the G268R mutation, including the P74S/G268R triple mutant responsible for conferring blood type O, immediately reveals the reason for the inactivation of the transferase, as Arg-268 completely obstructs the donor sugar recognition site. In the wild-type and BAAA structures the critical amino acids Leu/Met-266 directly recognize their respective donors by forming complementary interactions between the corresponding acetamido and hydroxyl groups substituted on C-2 of GalNAc and Gal. The second critical residue involved in donor recognition, Gly/Ala-268, is not thought to contact the donor sugar in GTA, whereas it excludes the bulkier A donor in GTB (6Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The G268R mutation renders this delicate recognition mechanism moot by completely blocking donor-sugar access to the active site (Figs. 1a and 2). In contrast to the donor, unambiguous electron density was observed for the H-antigen disaccharide acceptor, showing that the G268R mutation does not exclude this substrate from the binding site (Fig. 1b). These results are consistent with the Km values observed for all G268R mutants, which show KA values that are larger than wild-type GTA enzyme, but comparable with BAAA values, and KB values that are dramatically higher. Fig. 2 shows the severe conflicts between the GalNAc of donor and Arg-268 that limits its access to the active site. The G268R mutant enzyme also showed very low activity with a value of kcat 4.0 × 104-fold lower than that of the wild-type GTA, confirming that the Arg-268 mutation was mainly responsible for the deactivation of the enzyme. G268R displays Km values for the donor that are significantly higher than the wild-type and BAAA enzymes, whereas Km values for acceptor are not as elevated. The KA value was 16-fold higher than GTA and 3.3 times higher than the BAAA, whereas the KB value was 80 times higher than GTA and 20 times higher than BAAA. This indicates that although the mutation at residue 268 mainly affects donor binding, it affects acceptor binding as well. The observation in the crystal structure that the Arg-268 mutation completely blocks the donor sugar site indicates that the physical event corresponding to the observed KB value is the binding of the UDP moiety. This is supported by the fact that the enzyme clearly binds the UDP-hexanolamine affinity column during purification. However, UDP was not observed bound to the enzyme in the crystal structure despite using crystallization conditions similar to those that led to the observation of bound UDP in the structures of the native GTA and GTB enzymes (6Patenaude S.I.

Most surprisingly, the drastic G268R mutation does not significantly affect acceptor orientation, as this substrate is observed to form the same sets of interactions in the mutant as the wild-type enzyme. However, both the Leu-266 and Arg-268 side chains become disordered upon binding of the acceptor, whereas they are ordered in the unliganded mutant enzyme (Fig. 1). Most interestingly, the P74S mutation also shows significant impact on the reaction kinetics. The P74S mutation alone causes a 3-fold reduction in kcat of that in BAAA, bringing it to levels comparable with the wild-type GTA. The same mutation in BAAA G268R causes a 13-fold reduction in kcat in an enzyme that is already 40,000 times less active than the wild type. Although it is clear that the mutation at Arg-268 is the primary contributor to nonfunctionality of the O2 enzyme, the effect of the P74S mutation is notable as this residue lies in the stem region of the enzyme and not in the catalytic domain and is more than 30 Å distant from the active site. An examination of the crystal structure reveals a potential reason for this effect, as the stem regions of adjacent molecules in the crystal lattice are observed to interact to form dimers (Fig. 3). The dimer interface involves the first 15 N-terminal residues of the stem region and is situated such that residues adjacent to Pro-74 in one-half of the dimer are in contact with residues close to the active site in the other half of the dimer. Although the P74S mutation does not induce any significant change in crystal structures of the enzyme or change the topology of the active site and characteristic acceptor contacts (6Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the mutation from proline to serine would alter its flexibility and causes some rearrangement in the hydrogen bonding patterns. The dimerization observed for the soluble construct of O2 mutant enzyme is also observed in the wild-type GTA and GTB structures. An examination of glycosyltransferases with related folds with known structure shows that this dimerization through the N-terminal residues is not a general feature but is specific to the crystal packing of GTA, GTB, and their mutants. Nevertheless, soluble fragments of GTA and GTB are known to circulate in sera where they would have the opportunity to form dimers. Evidence that the dimerization observed in the crystal lattice is also present in solution comes from electrophoresis experiments. SDS-PAGE of a purified sample shows a single band of appropriate molecular weight; however, the removal of SDS and dithiothreitol from the running buffer results in the appearance of a second band at higher molecular weight corresponding to a GTA dimer. N-terminal sequencing of the band confirmed it was GTA. In summary, the primary effect of the G268R mutation in O2 glycosyltransferase is restriction of the access of the monosaccharide GalNAc of donor in the enzyme active site. Substrate turnover is extremely slow, with kcat values orders of magnitude lower than wild-type glycosyltransferase A. Acceptor binding is also affected as reflected in an increase in Km for H-acceptor; however, its orientation in the active site is unchanged from that of wild-type GTA. Although low levels of GTA activity have been reported in the pooled serum of blood type O individuals, ultra-sensitive enzyme assays on a single O2 serum sample will be required for confirmation of the weak activity observed for our recombinant protein.

https://openalex.org/W1999052332,"The T1 recognition domains of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel subunits form tetramers and acquire tertiary structure while still attached to their individual ribosomes. Here we ask when and in which compartment secondary and tertiary structures are acquired. We answer this question using biogenic intermediates and recently developed folding and accessibility assays to evaluate the status of the nascent Kv peptide both inside and outside of the ribosome. A compact structure (likely helical) that corresponds to a region of helicity in the mature structure is already manifest in the nascent protein within the ribosomal tunnel. The T1 domain acquires tertiary structure only after emerging from the ribosomal exit tunnel and complete synthesis of the T1-S1 linker. These measurements of ion channel folding within the ribosomal tunnel and its exit port bear on basic principles of protein folding and pave the way for understanding the molecular basis of protein misfolding, a fundamental cause of channelopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2048105864,"In pancreatic β-cells, glucose causes a rapid increase in the rate of protein synthesis. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood. In this report, we demonstrate, in the pancreatic β-cell line MIN6, that glucose stimulates the recruitment of ribosomes onto the mRNA, indicative of an increase in the rate of the initiation step of protein synthesis. This increase in the rate of initiation is not mediated through an increase in the availability of the initiation complex eIF4F, because glucose is unable to stimulate eIF4F assembly or, in the absence of amino acids, modulate the phosphorylation status of 4E-BP1. Moreover, in MIN6 cells and isolated islets of Langerhans, rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, only partially inhibited glucose-stimulated protein synthesis. However, we show that glucose stimulates the dephosphorylation of eIF2α in MIN6 cells and the assembly of the translational ternary complex, eIF2-GTP·Met-tRNAi, in both MIN6 cells and islets of Langerhans. The changes in the phosphorylation of eIF2α are not mediated by the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum eIF2α kinase (PERK), because PERK is not phosphorylated at low glucose concentrations and overexpression of a dominant negative form of PERK has no significant effect on either glucose-stimulated protein synthesis or the phosphorylation of eIF2α. Taken together, these results indicate that glucose-stimulated protein synthesis in pancreatic β-cells is regulated by a mechanism largely independent of the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin, but which is likely to be dependent on the availability of the translational ternary complex, regulated by the phosphorylation status of eIF2α.

However, the mechanism by which glucose regulates protein synthesis in pancreatic β-cells is poorly understood. One key step in the regulation of protein synthesis is the recruitment of the 40 S ribosome to the mRNA.

Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). An important mechanism regulating eIF4F assembly involves a family of eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs, archetype 4E-BP1) (12Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C.

Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). In their hypophosphorylated forms, 4E-BP1 competes with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E and can therefore inhibit eIF4F complex formation. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 leads to its dissociation from eIF4E, therefore allowing eIF4E to bind eIF4G, potentially leading to an increase in mRNA translation (14Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 15Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2121-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a step considered a prerequisite for eIF4F assembly. Another important rate-limiting step in the regulation of protein synthesis is the binding of the methionyl-initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi) to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, regulated by the availability of the translational ternary complex (eIF2-GTP·Met-tRNAi), consisting of the heterotrimeric eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), GTP, and Met-tRNAi (21Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). The binding of the Met-tRNAi to the 40 S ribosomal subunit is dependent on the formation of the translational ternary complex that assembles only when eIF2 is in its GTP-bound state (21Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar, 22Webb B.L. Proud C.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The 40 S ribosomal subunit, in association with a number of initiation factors (including the eIF4F complex), delivers the eIF2-GTP-bound Met-tRNAi to the AUG start codon. This is followed by the joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit, leading to the formation of the 80 S ribosome. The GTP bound to eIF2 is then hydrolyzed to GDP and Pi, yielding the inactive eIF2·GDP complex, which is unable to bind Met-tRNAi. The recycling of the inactive eIF2·GDP complex to the active eIF2·GTP complex is catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B (21Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar, 23Price N. Proud C. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). eIF2B plays a crucial role in ternary complex formation and is regulated in response to a wide range of conditions by several mechanisms, including phosphorylation, allosteric regulation, and competitive inhibition by the phosphorylated form of the α-subunit of eIF2 (eIF2α) (21Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). Interestingly, eIF2B activity is transiently up-regulated in isolated islets of Langerhans in response to glucose (20Gilligan M. Welsh G.I. Flynn A. Bujalska I. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2121-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, glucose may be an important modulator of ternary complex formation and hence protein synthesis in pancreatic β-cells. Competitive inhibition of eIF2B by the phosphorylated form of eIF2α is the most studied and best characterized example by which eIF2B activity is modulated. Several eIF2 kinases have been identified in mammals: the double-stranded RNA-dependent eIF2 kinase (PKR), the mammalian orthologue of the yeast GCN2 protein kinase (mGCN2), the heme-regulated eIF2 kinase (HRI), and the eIF2 kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). These kinases respond to different physiological stimuli. For example, PKR is induced by interferon and regulated by double-stranded RNA (24Clemens M.J. Int. J. Biochem.

Additionally, islets isolated from pre-diabetic PERK knock-out mice have increased glucose-stimulated proinsulin synthesis (32Harding H.P. Zeng H. Zhang Y. Jungries R. Chung P. Plesken H. Sabatini D.D. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), indicating that eIF2α phosphorylation may play a role in the specific regulation of proinsulin synthesis. In this report, we demonstrate that glucose-stimulated protein synthesis in pancreatic β-cells is accompanied by an increase in the rate of initiation. This increase is not mediated through an increase in the assembly of the eIF4F complex and is only partially dependent on the activity of mTOR. However, we show that glucose stimulates an increase in the availability of the translational ternary complex and the dephosphorylation of eIF2α. Therefore, taken together, glucose-stimulated protein synthesis in pancreatic β-cells is likely the result of an increase in the rate of initiation mediated through an increase in the availability of the translational ternary complex, brought about by the dephosphorylation of eIF2α. Chemicals and Materials—Rapamycin was purchased from Calbiochem. m7GTP-Sepharose and RNAguard™ were from Amersham Biosciences. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glucose (DMEM) and fetal calf serum were obtained from Invitrogen. All other chemicals (unless stated) were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture and Treatment—In this study, MIN6 cells (kindly provided by Prof. Jun-Ichi Miyazaki) were used between passages 16 and 35 at ∼80% confluence. MIN6 cells were grown in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose (DMEM full media) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin sulfate, and 75 μm β-mercaptoethanol, equilibrated with 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Prior to treatment, the medium was removed and the cells washed twice with either HEPES-balanced Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (KRB buffer) or DMEM minus glucose (DMEM). The cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in KRB buffer or DMEM containing 2 mm glucose (unless otherwise stated) prior to incubation in KRB buffer or DMEM containing 2 or 20 mm glucose for a further hour (unless otherwise stated). Full details of treatments are provided in the figure legends. After treatment, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were lysed by the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm sodium fluoride. The lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatants were kept, and total protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The protein lysates were stored at –80 °C until further analysis. Sedimentation Gradients and Polysome Analysis—MIN6 cells were incubated for 1 h in either KRB or DMEM supplemented with 2 mm glucose prior to the cells being incubated for a further 1 h in either KRB or DMEM supplemented with either 2 or 20 mm glucose. Cycloheximide was added for the last 5 min to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. After treatment, the cells were scraped into polysome extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 130 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml heparin, 1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μl/ml RNA-guard) and lysed using 15 strokes of a potter homogenizer. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C to remove nuclei and cellular debris. The supernatants were then layered onto 7–47% sucrose gradients (sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 130 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml heparin, 1 mg/ml cyclohexamide, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and centrifuged for 2 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C in a TH64.1 rotor (Sorvall). The gradients were pumped, by upward displacement, through a UV monitor, and the absorbance was read at 254 nm using an ISCO gradient collector. Islet Isolation and Culturing—Pancreatic islets were isolated from 200- to 250-g female Wistar rats by collagenase digestion and Histopaque density gradient centrifugation as previously described (3Guest P.C. Rhodes C.J. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Islets were either used immediately or were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 5.6 mm glucose with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (see figure legends for details). Prior to treatment, islets were washed twice with either KRB buffer or DMEM minus glucose. The cells were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in KRB buffer or DMEM containing 2 mm glucose prior to incubation in KRB buffer or DMEM containing 2 or 20 mm glucose for the times indicated in the figure legends (full details of treatments are provided in the figure legends). After treatment, islets were collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 16,000 × g and lysed by the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer. Adenovirus Generation and Adenoviral Infection—cDNA encoding the firefly luciferase reporter downstream of the 5′-UTR of ATF4 and cDNA encoding amino acids 1–583 of PERK (PERKΔC) were subcloned from the plasmids TK::ATF4UTR::LUC (30Harding H.P.

Recombinant adenoviruses expressing ATF4 luciferase (Ad-ATF4luc) and PERKΔC (Ad-PERKΔC) were then prepared using the Ad-easy system (33He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar) as previously described (34Gomez E. Pritchard C. Herbert T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48146-48151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The adenoviral and shuttle vectors were provided by Prof. Tong-Chuan He, Howard Hughes Medical Institute & Johns Hopkins Oncology Center. Recombinant adenoviruses containing EGFP (Ad-emptyEGFP) were a gift from Dr. Jo Carter (University of Leicester). To infect MIN6 cells or islets of Langerhans, the recombinant adenoviruses were mixed with culture medium, and cells were exposed to the viruses with a 100–200 multiplicity of infection for 24–48 h prior to the experiment. Under these conditions, >90% of cells were infected, as determined by EGFP expression. Protein Synthesis Measurements—Protein synthesis measurements were performed as described previously (35Herbert T.P. Kilhams G.R. Batty I.H. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11249-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the cell treatments were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine for 1 h. All treatments were stopped by washing the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysing them in ice-cold extraction buffer (as described under “Cell Culture and Treatment”). Cell lysates were prepared, and equal amounts of protein (about 20 μg) were spotted onto 3MM Whatman filters. The filters were then washed by boiling them for 1 min in 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.1g/liter methionine. This was repeated three times. The filters were then dried and immersed in scintillant before determining radioactivity by scintillation counting. SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, and Immunoprecipitation—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (35Herbert T.P. Kilhams G.R. Batty I.H. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11249-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The anti-eIF2α, anti-4E-BP1, anti-eIF4G1, anti-eIF4A, and anti-poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) antibodies were generous gifts from Chris Proud (Dundee University), Adri Thomas (Utrecht University), Simon Morley (Sussex University), H. Trachsel (Bern University), and Amelia Nieto (Centro Nacional de Biotecnología Cantoblanco, Madrid), respectively. Anti-phospho (Ser-65 and Thr-36/45) 4E-BP1, anti-eIF4E, anti-phospho (Thr-980) PERK, anti-phospho (Ser-235/236) ribosomal protein S6 and anti-Erk2 antisera were purchased from New England Biolabs. Anti-luciferase antiserum was purchased from Chemicon. Anti-phospho (Ser-51) eIF2α was purchased from Biosource. Detection was by horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit/mouse secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, immunoprecipitations of luciferase were performed as follows. Anti-luciferase antibody was coupled to Protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at room temperature. The bound antibody/protein G complexes were then added to [35S]methionine-labeled MIN6 protein lysates and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the bound proteins were finally eluted into Laemmli sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar) prior to being separated by SDS-PAGE. The [35S]methionine-labeled luciferase was then visualized by autoradiography. m7GTP-Sepharose Chromatography—m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography was performed as described previously (37Herbert T.P. Tee A.R. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11591-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of protein (0.3–0.4 mg) were incubated with 30 μl of m7GTP-Sepharose CL-6B for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times in lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by immunoblotting using anti-sera against eIF4E, eIF4G1, 4E-BP1, eIF4A, and PABP. Glucose-stimulated Protein Synthesis Is Mediated through an Increase in the Rate of Initiation—To investigate the mechanism by which glucose regulates protein synthesis in pancreatic β-cells, we initially determined the rates of protein synthesis at either low or high glucose concentrations in the pancreatic β-cell line MIN6, a cell line that synthesizes and secretes insulin in response to physiologically relevant glucose concentrations (6Skelly R.H. Schuppin G.T. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 37-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.I. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). MIN6 cells were preincubated for 1 h in either KRB or DMEM (i.e. in the absence or presence of amino acids) containing 2 mm glucose and then further incubated for 1 h at either 2 or 20 mm glucose in the presence or absence of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin-D. Increasing glucose concentration from 2 to 20 mm led to a significant increase in [35S]methionine incorporation into total protein in cells incubated in either KRB or DMEM. These increases were unaffected by the addition of actinomycin-D, demonstrating that glucose-stimulated protein synthesis is mediated by a post-transcriptional mechanism (Fig. 1). These results are in agreement with and extend previous findings in MIN6 cells (6Skelly R.H. Schuppin G.T. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 37-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To establish which step in protein synthesis may be important in glucose-stimulated protein synthesis, we determined the polysome profile of MIN6 cells incubated at both 2 and 20 mm glucose in either KRB or DMEM (Fig. 2). In cells incubated in either KRB or DMEM, increasing glucose concentration from 2 to 20 mm led to a decrease in the 80 S monosomal peak along with an increase in the number of polysomes, indicative of an increase in the rate of the initiation phase of protein synthesis. Additionally, the polysome to monosome ratio at either low or high glucose concentrations is greater when cells are incubated in DMEM compared with those incubated in KRB. This indicates that the basal rates of protein synthesis are higher in cells incubated in DMEM than those incubated in KRB. The Role of mTOR in Glucose-stimulated Protein Synthesis in MIN6 Cells—Amino acids and glucose have been shown to influence the rate of protein synthesis in a number of cell types through the modulation of the phosphorylation status of 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase via a mechanism that is dependent on mTOR. We therefore investigated the role of mTOR in glucose-stimulated protein synthesis in MIN6 cells. MIN6 cells were preincubated for 1 h in either KRB or DMEM supplemented with 2 mm glucose and then further incubated for 1 h in the same medium (KRB or DMEM) at either 2 mm or 20 mm glucose in the presence or absence of rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR (Fig. 3). Increasing glucose concentration in cells incubated in KRB (i.e. in the absence of amino acids) had no effect on the phosphorylation of either p70 S6 kinase or 4E-BP1 as assessed by determining: 1) the mobility of both 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase on SDS-PAGE; 2) the phosphorylation of specific residues within 4E-BP1, Thr-36/45 and Ser-65; and 3) the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, a substrate for p70 S6 kinase (Fig. 3a). In contrast, in MIN6 cells incubated in DMEM, an increase in glucose concentration led to: 1) an increase in the phosphorylation of both 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase, demonstrated by their decrease in mobility on SDS-PAGE; 2) the phosphorylation of residues Thr-36/45 and Ser-65 within 4E-BP1; and 3) an increase in the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 at Ser-235/236 (Fig. 3a). In this latter condition (i.e. in the presence of amino acids), rapamycin completely blocked both the basal and glucose-stimulated phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase, 4E-BP1, and S6, indicating that mTOR plays an important role in these events (Fig. 3a). Indeed, it has been previously demonstrated that amino acids are required for glucose-stimulated phosphorylation of downstream targets of mTOR in the pancreatic β-cell line RINm5F cells and in islets (39Xu G. Kwon G. Marshall C.A. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28178-28184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and this explains why glucose cannot stimulate the phosphorylation of the downstream targets of mTOR in KRB. Because the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 can lead to its release from eIF4E, an increase in eIF4F complex assembly (i.e. an increase in the association of eIF4G and eIF4A with eIF4E) and hence the rate of initiation, we therefore examined the effect of glucose on eIF4F assembly by pulling down eIF4E and associated proteins using 7mGTP-Sepharose beads (Fig. 3b). In KRB (i.e. in the absence of amino acids), an increase in glucose concentration from 2 to 20 mm had no detectable effect on the dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E, on eIF4F assembly, or on the association of PABP with the eIF4F c"
https://openalex.org/W2077648822,"Several molecular mechanisms for cleavage of the oxalate carbon-carbon bond by manganese-dependent oxalate decarboxylase have recently been proposed involving high oxidation states of manganese. We have examined the oxalate decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis by electron paramagnetic resonance in perpendicular and parallel polarization configurations to test for the presence of such species in the resting state and during enzymatic turnover. Simulation and the position of the half-field Mn(II) line suggest a nearly octahedral metal geometry in the resting state. No spectroscopic signature for Mn(III) or Mn(IV) is seen in parallel mode EPR for samples frozen during turnover, consistent either with a large zero-field splitting in the oxidized metal center or undetectable levels of these putative high-valent intermediates in the steady state. A narrow, featureless g = 2.0 species was also observed in perpendicular mode in the presence of substrate, enzyme, and dioxygen. Additional splittings in the signal envelope became apparent when spectra were taken at higher temperatures. Isotopic editing resulted in an altered line shape only when tyrosine residues of the enzyme were specifically deuterated. Spectral processing confirmed multiple splittings with isotopically neutral enzyme that collapsed to a single prominent splitting in the deuterated enzyme. These results are consistent with formation of an enzyme-based tyrosyl radical upon oxalate exposure. Modestly enhanced relaxation relative to abiological tyrosyl radicals was observed, but site-directed mutagenesis indicated that conserved tyrosine residues in the active site do not host the unpaired spin. Potential roles for manganese and a peripheral tyrosyl radical during steady-state turnover are discussed.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7659-7669Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A previously published electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of the enzyme in the resting state confirmed the presence of Mn(II) but did not address the question of higher valence states under turnover conditions (2Tanner A. Bowater L. Fairhurst S.A. Bornemann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43627-43634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The current work addresses the valence of the manganese center that predominates in the resting state and after oxalate addition with perpendicular and parallel mode electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition, the identity of an observed radical species appearing shortly after oxalate addition was established using isotopically edited oxalate, O2, solvent, and protein. The time course of radical production and decay was estimated by kinetic simulation using a simple model, and compared with the overall rate of enzyme turnover. Finally, the power saturation and temperature response of the radical species were explored, and line shape features compared with known enzymatic species in order to propose an identity for the observed species. Materials—Potassium oxalate, oxalic acid, and Amicon ultrafiltration membranes were obtained from Fisher. d4-l-Tyrosine, the ProteoProfile Trypsin In-Gel Digest Kit, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES), and piperazine were from Sigma-Aldrich. The sodium salt of [13C]oxalic acid was obtained from Isotec/Sigma-Aldrich. 17O2 at 28.8% isotopic enrichment was obtained from Icon Isotopes (Summit, NJ). All chemicals were used without further purification. Site-directed mutagenesis of YvrK active site tyrosyl residues Tyr-200 (N-terminal site) and Tyr-340 (C-terminal site) to phenylalanine was carried out using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the construct sequence verified using the services of the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research. Mutagenic primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc (Coralville, IA). Preparation of Native and d4-Tyr-labeled Oxalate Decarboxylase— Isotopically neutral YvrK protein was overexpressed, purified, and assayed as described (4Reinhardt L.A. Svedruzic D. Chang C.H. Cleland W.W. Richards N.G.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1244-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Lowry (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of ring-deuterated tyrosine was achieved by growing cells in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 50 mg/liter phenylalanine, 35 mg/liter tryptophan, 5 mg/liter tyrosine, and 1 g/liter N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine (glyphosate) to inhibit de novo biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (13Kim H.W. Perez J.A. Ferguson S.J. Campbell I.D. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 34-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The culture was initiated with a limiting concentration of unlabeled tyrosine rather than the isotopically labeled form in order to minimize the possibility of deuterium incorporation into other amino acids through metabolic scrambling during biomass accumulation. Medium was inoculated with a freshly transformed single colony of bacterial cells and shaken at 250 rpm at 37 °C. When the cell culture started to leave the exponential growth phase, because of limiting tyrosine (OD600 ∼0.8), 50 mg/liter of l-4-hydroxyphenyl-2,3,5,6-d4-alanine (d4-tyrosine) was added. Since the yield of expression and specific activity of OxDC depends on the ability of cells to express heat shock proteins before induction (2Tanner A. Bowater L. Fairhurst S.A. Bornemann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43627-43634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the culture was allowed to reach exponential growth phase again (OD600 ∼ 1.2) before heat-shocking at 42 °C for 18 min and subsequent addition of isopropyl β-d-galactothiopyranoside and MnCl2 to final concentrations of 1 and 5 mm, respectively. Addition of MnCl2 caused formation of a white precipitate, most likely the manganous glyphosate complex. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation after 3 h of induction at 37 °C, and enzyme manipulated and purified as for the unlabeled protein. Tryptic Digestion and Mass Spectroscopy—d4-Tyrosine incorporation was verified by tryptic digestion of labeled YvrK and mass spectral analysis of the fragments. Purified OxDC (18 μg) was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and prepared according to protocols supplied with the ProteoProfile kit. The mass profile of the peptide mixture thus prepared was analyzed on a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DE-PRO matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer at the Protein Chemistry Core Facility, Biotechnology Program, University of Florida. Preparation of Samples for EPR Spectroscopy—Unless otherwise noted, EPR sample pH was buffered with 50 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.2. Enzyme preparations were dialyzed, chromatographed over G-25 size exclusion resin, or diafiltered to remove free manganese. Reactions were initiated by addition of oxalate or an analog of oxalate, if present. After transfer of the necessary reaction components to the EPR sample tubes, samples were frozen within 1–2 s by immersion into an isopentane bath prepared by cooling with a secondary liquid nitrogen bath until rapid nitrogen boiling subsided. Aerobically prepared samples were sealed with clay or wax in order to prevent condensation of liquid oxygen in the sample tube during spectral acquisition. 17O2 was received from the supplier in breakseal flasks. A working stock of gas was prepared by attaching via needle-terminated Tygon tubing the breakseal flask along with a small stainless steel bearing to a round-bottomed flask of approximately equal volume sealed with a rubber septum (Supplemental Fig. S1A). The receiving flask and Tygon tubing were evacuated with a second needle attached to the vacuum manifold and inserted through the rubber septum. After this second needle was removed, the glass seal was broken by a sharp blow with the bearing. 17O2 was condensed into the round bottom flask by cooling with liquid nitrogen. After transfer, the needle and tubing were removed and the sealed flask warmed back to room temperature. To make a gas mix resembling an aerobic environment, four volumes of nitrogen gas and one volume of enriched 17O2 were syringed into an evacuated flask of appropriate volume (Supplemental Fig. S1B). For anaerobic samples or those containing 17O2, enzyme was mixed aerobically with all reagents except oxalate and 17O2, transferred to a 3-mm inner diameter EPR tube, and flash-frozen by liquid nitrogen immersion before attachment to a vacuum/argon double manifold by a short length of standard rubber vacuum tubing (Supplemental Fig. S1C). The EPR tube headspace was exchanged for argon by three pump-vent cycles. Enzyme solution was allowed to degas by thawing under argon. This procedure was performed three times before addition of other reagents. 17O2 was transferred to the degassed enzyme solution by first flame-sealing the EPR tube containing frozen and evacuated enzyme + buffer, then attaching this tube to vacuum tubing connected to a sealed round-bottom flask containing either 17O2 (28.8% enriched) or 20% 17O2/80% N2 (Supplemental Fig. S1C). Subsequent breakage of the EPR tube by gentle pressure with pliers permitted exposure of the frozen enzyme solution to the alternative gas mixture (Supplemental Fig. S1D). Enzyme was thawed and left to equilibrate with the headspace for 30 min before freezing and transfer back to the manifold. Oxalate was added by disconnecting the EPR tube from the manifold under argon flow, adding the necessary volume of degassed oxalate stock solution by syringe, temporarily sealing the tube and shaking all liquid to the bottom of the EPR tube to mix, then quickly reattaching the tube to the manifold, and freezing to quench the reaction. The headspace was then evacuated and the tube flame-sealed for spectral analysis. Samples to test the effects of D2O on the radical spectrum were prepared with buffer and substrate stock solutions containing 99% isotopically enriched D2O instead of H2O. The hydrogen ion concentration of buffer and oxalate stock solutions was adjusted with HCl or NaOH, however. The equivalent sample pD should thus be 5.6 because of the equilibrium deuterium isotope effect on protonation and the use of protium at the reference electrode (14Glasoe P.K. Long F.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1960; 64: 188-190Crossref Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). This difference is expected to be relevant only for quantitation, not the qualitative line shape analyses performed here as discussed under “Results” for isotopically neutral samples at pH 7. Enzyme was diafiltered into deuterated storage buffer (20 mm hexamethylenetetraamine, pD 6.4; 0.5 m NaCl) through a Microcon YM30 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). We estimate the exchange efficiency and final deuterium enrichment to be ≥98%. Temporal Evolution of the YvrK Radical Signal under Turnover Conditions—A 5-ml reaction mixture was prepared containing 2 mg/ml YvrK, 50 mm potassium acetate buffer pH 5.2. The reaction was begun by addition of potassium oxalate to 100 mm final concentration. Aliquots (500 μl) were quenched at different times by cryogenic flash-freezing for EPR samples, or by adding NaOH to 0.1 m final concentration for oxalate consumption measurements. Radical Quenching in the Frozen State—To measure the lability of the observed radical in the temperature range used for “high-temperature” spectral acquisition, a sample of enzyme undergoing turnover was flash-frozen 2 min after introduction of substrate oxalate. The temperature was raised to 100 K, a reference spectrum taken, and radical intensity monitored for 30 min at each temperature 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 180, and 200 K. Single scans were acquired at 0.6 milliwatts with a 10 G modulation amplitude and a 10.5 s sweep time. To rule out temperature broadening or reversible chemical processes as the cause of the decreased signal intensity, after acquiring the last scan at 200 K, cryostat temperature was lowered to 100 K and a spectrum acquired under the same conditions as at the beginning of the experiment. The sample was then thawed briefly and refrozen to test for continued turnover. The presence of an intensified radical signal relative to that seen in the final 200 K scan confirmed the presence of oxalate in the solution, showing that the enzyme was initially frozen under turnover conditions prior to complete consumption of substrate. Spectral Acquisition and Analysis—CW perpendicularly polarized X-band spectra were acquired on either a Bruker Elexsys model E580 spectrometer operating in TE101 mode, or a Bruker model ECS106 with a dual-mode cavity operating in TE102 mode. Temperature control on both instruments was maintained with an Oxford Instruments model ESR900 helium flow cryostat coupled to an Oxford ITC 503 temperature controller. Parallel polarization spectra were measured in the ECS106 operating in TE012 mode. Simulations were done with the EasySpin toolbox (15Stoll, S. (2003) Spectral Simulations in Solid-state EPR. Ph.D. thesis, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ZürichGoogle Scholar) in combination with the MATLAB computing environment (The MathWorks, Natick, MA), and with programs written by one of the authors (A. O.). Time course data for the development and decay of the YvrK radical were numerically simulated to test potential kinetic models using the program package Gepasi (16Mendes P. Comput. Appl.

The rate constants thus derived were compared with the turnover number in EPR samples, which was calculated based on the initial slope of a plot of [formate] versus time. Resolution enhancement of the high temperature radical signal was performed with software written in the Reed laboratory (19Reed G.H. Ballinger M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 362-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For measurement of P½, the radical signal intensity was taken as the magnitude of the peak-to-trough difference. Data were transformed and plotted to fit parameters of the standard Equation 1 (20Rupp M. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Cammack R. Biochim. Biophys.

The Manganese Centers in B. subtilis Oxalate Decarboxylase—The OxDC from B. subtilis has been previously demonstrated to be a manganoenzyme as purified from an Escherichia coli overexpression system (2Tanner A.

Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7659-7669Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) As expected, the X-band spectrum of the resting state enzyme in perpendicular mode shown in Fig. 1, A–C displays a sextet pattern centered at g = 2.003 characteristic of the hyperfine-split MS = –½ ⇆ +½ central-field transition of Mn(II). The shoulders on the main central field sextet at magnetic fields of ∼3060 G and 3700 G arise from transitions between fine structure sublevels other than the central field transition, and are broadened relative to the central field line due to the greater anisotropy of transitions between outer MS levels (23Whiting A.K. Boldt Y.R. Hendrich M.P. Wackett L.P. Que L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Simulation of these and other broad lines apparent in the spectrum shown in Fig. 1, A–C assuming only an axial zero-field splitting component provides an estimate for D of 0.023 cm–1 (Fig. 1B). In addition, observation of the distinctive sextet feature present near g = 4.3, which we attribute to a half-field transition (24Abragam A. Bleaney B. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance of Transition Metal Ions. Clarendon Press, Oxford1970: 454-518Google Scholar), implies modest zero-field splitting well below the X-band energy of 0.3 cm–1. The hyperfine splitting of the half-field transition was measured as 94 G, essentially the same as that seen for the central field line (93 G). The presence of the half-field line and the magnitude of the hyperfine splittings are consistent with a single environment of octahedral coordination of manganese; we note that a second binding environment for manganese to account for the half-field line is not necessary, as was suggested earlier (2Tanner A. Bowater L. Fairhurst S.A. Bornemann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43627-43634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Likewise, the apparent splitting of the hyperfine lines of the g ∼ 2 signal evident in Fig. 1A is well precedented, and understood to arise in a single molecular environment from forbidden {ΔMS =±1, ΔMI =±1} transitions that gain intensity through the small axial zero-field splitting coupling to the hyperfine transition intensity in second and third order perturbation theory (25Reed G.H. Markham G.D. Berliner L.J. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. 6. Plenum Press, New York1984: 73-142Google Scholar, 26Morrissey S.R. Horton T.E. DeRose V.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3473-3481Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Notably, the intensity of the higher-field hyperfine line (sharp peak just below 3600 G in the spectrum of Fig. 1A) is slightly greater than the others immediately downfield. This may be compared with the identical feature seen for Mn(II) bound to the hammerhead ribozyme as contrasted with free Mn(H2O)62+, the latter complex showing a more equitable distribution of intensities across this high field hyperfine triplet (26Morrissey S.R. Horton T.E. DeRose V.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3473-3481Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Vogt M. DeRose V.J. Telser J. Paramagnetic Resonance of Metallobiomolecules. 858. Oxford University Press, Washington, D. C.2003: 193-211Google Scholar). This observation supports protein-bound rather than freely solvated manganous ions as the source of the EPR signals reported herein. Manganic ion often exhibits parallel mode EPR signals at apparent free electron g-values near 8–9 (∼800 G at X-band), as can be seen in the spectra of salicylidenato Mn(III) and acetylacetonato Mn(III) (28Campbell K.A. Lashley M.R. Wyatt J.K. Nantz M.H. Britt R.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5710-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 29Krzystek J. Yeagle G.J. Park J-H. Britt R.D. Meisel M.W. Brunel L.-C. Telser J. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 42: 4610-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and in the spectrum of oxidized manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (30Campbell K.A. Yikilmaz E. Grant C.V. Gregor W. Miller A-F. Britt R.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 4714-4715Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). When OxDC is mixed anaerobically with oxalate, such that no turnover may occur, a variety of lines in the parallel mode spectrum with the characteristic sextet splitting of manganese are evident below fields of ∼1500 G (Fig. 1D), which may be attributed to greater transition intensity of the half-field line when B1 ∥ B0. In some cases, the presence of oxygen together with oxalate leads to an additional sextet at ∼800 G (Fig. 1E), suggestive of manganic ion. It was noticed that during the time between preparation and EPR analysis of the two samples used to obtain these spectra (Fig. 1, D and E), quenching of the organic radical species (observed in freshly prepared samples) took place after overnight storage at 77 K, with the concomitant appearance of a sextet at ∼800 G. From these observations, we conclude that slow radical quenching at 77 K is associated with formation of Mn(III) under these conditions. The absence of a spectral signature for manganic ion in freshly prepared, aerobic samples can be explained by the hypothesis that Mn(III) intermediates at physiological temperatures are either short-lived or not formed during steady-state catalytic turnover. Another possibility is that Mn(III)-containing enzyme has zero-field splittings that are too large to allow observation at X-band frequencies (see below). Overnight incubation of enzyme and substrate under aerobic conditions prior to freezing and immediate spectral acquisition led to the spectra shown in Fig. 2. The perpendicular mode spectrum (Fig. 2A) shows an intense g = 4.30 feature lacking obvious sextet splitting. This feature is also seen in samples that are incubated for shorter times, but which are annealed at 120–160 K prior to spectral acquisition at lower temperatures (4–10 K). In contrast, the parallel mode spectrum (Fig. 2B) is devoid of features in this spectral region. Besides the g = 4.30 feature, the perpendicularly polarized spectrum of the manganese signal in enzyme incubated overnight with oxalate shows a dramatic change in the central field region near g = 2. A much broader signal with its peak and trough centered at 2500 and 4000 G, respectively, can be observed, and the hyperfine-split central field transition seen in resting enzyme samples has been replaced with a narrower, almost featureless line at g = 2.06 (Fig. 2A). The peak-to-peak width of 120 G differs from that of the g = 4.30 feature (80 G), suggesting that the latter may not be a half-field transition related to the former consistent with the relative intensities of the two lines; half-field lines should be less intense than the main line. Rhombic g = 4.3 signals have been widely observed at liquid helium temperatures, and are usually attributed to junk iron, or Fe(III) in unknown, generalized ligand fields (31Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The enhancement of this signal in our samples could therefore reflect an oxidation process either adventitious over the extended incubation times, or specific because of oxidizing species arising from enzymatic catalysis. However, the concomitant degradation of the manganese central field sextet and appearance of this g = 4.3 line suggest the two processes may be linked, and that a change in the manganese ligation environment occurs over the extended incubation times and with the non-physiological oxalate concentrations used here. Radical Formation upon Oxalate Exposure—A sharp g = 2.0 signal with a peak-to-trough width of ∼23 G is formed upon exposure of enzyme to oxalate, as shown in Fig. 3. The signal width is too narrow to arise from a transition metal-associated signal, implying that an organic radical is formed during oxalate turnover. Generation of this species required the simultaneous presence of enzyme, oxalate, and oxygen, and was not observed in any of the isolated reaction components. The requirement for the simultaneous presence of O2, enzyme, and oxalate for both activity (2Tanner A. Bowater L. Fairhurst S.A. Bornemann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43627-43634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and radical formation strongly suggests that the observed species is related to enzymatic catalysis, although not necessarily on the main catalytic pathway. Quantitation against a DPPH standard sample at power levels well below the calculated P½ (see below) allow"

We demonstrate here that the NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B are not routinely expressed in cultured spinal neurons and that transfection with NR2A or NR2B reconstitutes the synaptic targeting of NMDA receptors and confers on exogenous application of the immediate early gene product Narp the ability to cluster both AMPA and NMDA receptors. The use of dominant-negative mutants of GluR2 further showed that the synaptic targeting of NMDA receptors is dependent on the presence of synaptic AMPA receptors and that synaptic AMPA and NMDA receptors are linked by Stargazin and a MAGUK protein. This system of AMPA receptor-dependent synaptic NMDA receptor localization was preserved in hippocampal interneurons but reversed in hippocampal pyramidal neurons."

The primary role of AVP involves the regulation of water and solute excretion from the kidney (1Ruggles B.T. Murayama N. Werness J.L. Gapstur S.M. Bentley M.D. Dousa T.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

The other physiological functions of AVP include control of blood pressure, platelet aggregation, liver glycogenolysis and neoglucogenesis, adrenocorticotropin release from the adenohypophysis, and aldosterone secretion from the adrenal gland (3Johnston C.I.

AVP is also implicated in interneuronal communication in the central nervous system and modulates several behavioral functions such as feeding, memory, thermoregulation, and the control of adaptive, social, and sexual processes (7de Wied D. Diamant M. Fodor M. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1993; 14: 251-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 8Alescio-Lautier B. Soumireu-Mourat B. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 119: 501-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vasotocin (VT; [Ile3]AVP) is the AVP counterpart in most nonmammalian vertebrates including lungfishes, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. In amphibians, VT is expressed in both hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic cell bodies (9González A. Smeets W.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1992; 315: 53-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), indicating that VT acts both as a neurohormone and neurotransmitter as reported for AVP in mammals. At the periphery, VT regulates osmotic and electrolyte balance (10Pang P.K. Sawyer W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: F151-F155PubMed Google Scholar, 11Warburg M.R. Zool.

In mammals, the actions of AVP are mediated through three different AVP receptors: V1aR, V1bR, and V2R (16Thibonnier M. Berti-Mattera L.N. Dulin N. Conarty D.M. Mattera R. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 119: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All these receptor subtypes belong to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily but differ in their tissue distribution, their relative affinity for synthetic analogs, and their signaling mechanisms (17Barberis C. Mouillac B. Durroux T. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 156: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 18Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 629-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar). All three types of receptors are expressed in the central nervous system (19Peter J. Burbach H. Adan R.A.

Nature. 1992; 357: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Upon ligand stimulation, V1aR and V1bR trigger the phospholipase C/protein kinase C signaling pathway, while V2R activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A pathway (24Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 629-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar). We have recently isolated and characterized a V1aR-type vasotocin receptor (VT1R) in the frogs Rana catesbeiana and Rana esculenta (25Acharjee S. Do-Rego J.L. Oh D.Y. Moon J.S. Ahn R.S. Lee K.S. Vaudry H. Kwon H.B. Seong J.Y. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 293-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Frog VT1R exhibits the highest sequence identity (58%) with mammalian V1aR among the AVP receptor subtypes and preferentially couples to the phospholipase C/protein kinase C signaling pathway as does V1aR. Frog VT1R shows a high sensitivity to VT but a very poor sensitivity to AVP. It is of interest to note that V1aR exhibits relatively high sensitivity to both AVP and VT, although AVP is slightly more potent than VT. Mutational studies coupled with computational modeling have demonstrated that the VT/AVP binding sites are localized within a narrow cleft delimited by most of the transmembrane regions, 15 Å deep from the extracellular surface of rat V1aR, and that these binding sites may be common to V1bR, V2R, and VTR as these receptors show high conservation of residues responsible for ligand binding (26Mouillac B.

In the present study, using a well defined chimeric receptor approach and site-directed mutagenesis (32Seong J.Y. Wang L. Oh D.Y. Yun O. Maiti K. Li J.H. Soh J.M. Choi H.S. Kim K. Vaudry H. Kwon H.B.

Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we attempted to determine the amino acid residues in rat V1aR and bullfrog VT1R (bfVT1R) that account for selective ligand sensitivity to AVP and VT. Peptides—Synthetic peptides including AVP, oxytocin (OT), VT, mesotocin (MT), the V1 agonist [Phe2,Orn8]OT, the V2 agonist [deamino-Cys1,Val4,d-Arg8]-AVP, the V1a antagonist [d(CH2)51,Tyr(Me)2]AVP, the V2 antagonist [d(CH2)51, d-Ile2,Ile4]AVP, and the OT antagonist [d(CH2)51,Tyr(Me)2,Thr4,Orn8,des-Gly-NH29]VT were purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). The OT agonist [Thr4,Gly7]OT was purchased from Sigma. Plasmids—The pcDNA3 expression vector was purchased from Invitrogen. The pCMVβ-Gal vector was obtained from Clontech. The c-fos-luc vector, containing the -711 ∼ +45 sequence of the human c-fos promoter constructed in the pFLASH vector, was a kind gift from Dr. R. Prywes, Columbia University. The full-length bfVT1R cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector at the EcoRI and XhoI enzyme sites as mentioned earlier (25Acharjee S. Do-Rego J.L. Oh D.Y. Moon J.S. Ahn R.S. Lee K.S. Vaudry H. Kwon H.B. Seong J.Y. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 293-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The rat V1aR cDNA was amplified through PCR from rat liver tissue and inserted at the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3. Constructions of Chimeras and Mutants—For domain swapping between bfVT1R and rat V1aR, individual cDNA fragments of interest were amplified through PCR by using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and two specific primers, one corresponding to the 5′ or the 3′ end of the receptor cDNAs and another corresponding to the region of overlap between the two receptors. The two fragments, one from bfVTR1 and the other from rat V1aR, were subjected to a second round of PCR to generate the chimeric cDNA. All the chimeric constructs were cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector at the EcoRI and XhoI sites. The single and double mutants were constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and then cloned into pcDNA3. The DNA sequences of the chimeras and mutants were analyzed by the dideoxy chain termination method using the DNA Sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) to confirm the accuracy of the constructions. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assays—CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. For luciferase assays, cells were plated in 24-well plates 1 day before transfection and transfected with SuperFect reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with the respective ligands for 6 h. For c-fos promoter-driven luciferase assay, cells were maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 16–18 h before treatment with the ligand as described previously (32Seong J.Y. Wang L. Oh D.Y. Yun O. Maiti K. Li J.H. Soh J.M. Choi H.S. Kim K. Vaudry H. Kwon H.B. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 454-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 6 h after ligand treatment, and luciferase activity in cell extracts was determined using a luciferase assay system according to the standard method in a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (EB & G Berthold, Germany). The luciferase values were normalized by the β-galactosidase values. Transfection experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Molecular Modeling—The rat V1aR was built by MODELLER 6v2 (34Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10284) Google Scholar) based on the crystal structure of the bovine rhodopsin (35Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) as a template. AVP was docked into the putative binding site of the rat V1aR constrained by previously known interactions. The models for rat V1aR/VT, triple V1aR/AVP mutant, and triple V1aR/VT mutant were built by mutating corresponding residues in the rat V1aR/AVP model, and the models went through energy minimization and molecular dynamics annealing simulations in the MODELLER program. The final geometry was confirmed by PROCHECK (36Laskowski R.A. Macarther M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The contacts between ligands and receptors were analyzed using Ligplot (37Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4174) Google Scholar). The figures of the models were drawn using Visual Molecular Dynamics (38Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35651) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Data analysis was performed using nonlinear regression, and data were expressed using sigmoid dose-response curves. Agonist or antagonist concentrations inducing half-maximal stimulation (EC50) or half-maximal inhibition (IC50) and maximal fold increase (Emax) were calculated using GraphPad PRISM2 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni test. Data were considered significant if p < 0.05. Fragment of TMDs VI to VII Confers Differential Ligand Selectivity—Differential ligand selectivity of rat V1aR and bfVT1R was examined using a c-fos promoter-driven luciferase assay (25Acharjee S. Do-Rego J.L. Oh D.Y. Moon J.S. Ahn R.S. Lee K.S. Vaudry H. Kwon H.B. Seong J.Y. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 293-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 39Oh D.Y. Wang L. Ahn R.S. Park J.Y. Seong J.Y. Kwon H.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 205: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rat V1aR had higher sensitivity toward AVP than VT as revealed by EC50 value (Fig. 1A and Table I). The bfVT1R showed a high sensitivity to VT but very low sensitivity toward AVP (Fig. 1B and Table I). VT differs from AVP by a single amino acid at position 3 (Phe for AVP and Ile for VT). Thus, it is likely that some critical amino acids responsible for interacting with Phe3 of AVP or Ile3 of VT are differentially arranged between V1aR and bfVT1R. As an initial step toward identifying selectivity-conferring regions, large segments of TMDs, intracellular loops (ICLs), and extracellular loops (ECLs) were swapped between rat V1aR and bfVT1R, and a series of reciprocal chimeras were constructed (Table I). The first set of chimeric receptors is composed of the amino-terminal fragment of bfVT1R in rat V1aR and vice versa (V1aR/VT1R(N) and VT1R/V1aR(N)). The second set includes the region from the amino terminus to half of ICL2 of one receptor followed by the sequence of the other receptor (V1aR/VT1R(N-ICL2) and VT1R/V1aR(N-ICL2)). The third set contains a substitution of the TMD VI to the carboxyl-terminal tail (C-tail) of one receptor with the other (V1aR/VT1R(TMD6-C) and VT1R/V1aR(TMD6-C)). The EC50 values of AVP and VT for the different chimeric receptors are indicated in Table I. Replacement of the amino-terminal domain of rat V1aR by that of bfVT1R (V1aR/VT1R(N)) led to a decrease in sensitivity to both AVP and VT. However, no significant changes in ligand sensitivity were observed in the reciprocal chimera, VT1R/V1aR(N). The V1aR/VT1R(N-ICL2) chimera showed a reduced sensitivity to both AVP and VT, while the VT1R/V1aR(N-ICL2) chimera showed an increased sensitivity to VT. Interestingly V1aR/VT1R(TMD6-C) showed a great decrease in sensitivity to AVP but a marked increase in sensitivity to VT, resulting in a reverse ligand selectivity (Table I and Fig. 2A). The opposite VT1R/V1aR(TMD6-C) chimera showed a great increase in sensitivity to AVP but a modest increase in sensitivity to VT (Table I and Fig. 2B). This result indicates that the residues determining ligand selectivity lie mainly in the sequences between TMDs VI and C-tail.Table IAVP and VT selectivities of chimeric receptors The plasmids containing the wild-type and chimeric receptors were cotransfected with the c-fos-luc reporter vector into CV-1 cells along with β-galactosidase as an internal control.

To further dissect the subdomains responsible for the ligand selectivity, three additional bfVT1R chimeras were constructed: VT1R with a fragment from ECL-3 to C-tail of rat V1aR (VT1R/V1aR(ECL3-C)), VT1R with TMD VII to C-tail of rat V1aR (VT1R/V1aR(TMD7-C)), and VT1R with the C-tail of rat V1aR (VT1R/V1aR(C)) (Table II). Compared with VT1R/V1aR(TMD6-C), VT1R/V1aR(ECL3-C) exhibited a lowered sensitivity to AVP. VT1R/V1aR(TMD7-C) showed a significantly decreased sensitivity to AVP. Moreover VT1R/V1aR(C) revealed a marked decrease in sensitivity to AVP such that it had an EC50 value for AVP similar to that of wild type bfVT1R. These results strongly suggest that the fragment between TMD VI to TMD VII is crucial for the ligand selectivity of mammalian and nonmammalian V1a-type receptors to AVP and VT.Table IIAVP and VT selectivities of VT1R chimeric receptorsa Versus wild type bfVT1R (p < 0.05).b Versus VTR/V1a(TMD6-C) (p < 0.05).

Identification of Individual Amino Acids Important for Determining Ligand Selectivity—To further identify the molecular determinants underlying such a differential ligand selectivity, the amino acid sequences of TMD VI to TMD VII within V1a-type receptors were analyzed (Fig. 3). As it has been demonstrated previously that nonapeptide hormones bind into a cleft 15 Å deep defined by the upper halves of TMDs (26Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25771-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), these regions were examined more carefully. In addition, the sequence of chicken VT1R was also considered as it shows a relatively high sensitivity to AVP among nonmammalian VT1Rs (40Tan F.L. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Saito N. MacLeod V. Baeyens D.A. Mayeux P.R. Jones S.M. Cornett L.E. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Three individual amino acid residues Phe313(6.51), Ile315(6.53), and Pro334(7.33) in the rat V1aR were chosen and mutated to those in bfVT1R. Phe307(6.51) in the hV1aR is known to be important for the interaction with antagonists but not agonists (41Cotte N. Balestre M.N. Aumelas A. Mahe E. Phalipou S. Morin D. Hibert M. Manning M. Durroux T. Barberis C. Mouillac B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4253-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, mutation of Phe6.51 → Tyr in rat V1aR led to a drastic decrease in the AVP sensitivity, while the sensitivity for VT remained unchanged (Fig. 4, A and B, and Table III). Mutation of Ile6.53 to Thr in rat V1aR did not significantly alter sensitivity for AVP but increased sensitivity for VT (Fig. 4, A and B, and Table III). This mutation increased receptor efficacy for both VT and AVP (Fig. 4, A and B, and Table III). Interestingly the Pro7.33 → Thr mutation led to a significant decrease in sensitivity to AVP, but this mutation did not alter sensitivity to VT (Fig. 4, A and B, and Table III). Based on these results we constructed a triple rat V1aR mutant (F6.51Y/I6.53T/P7.33T) to further explore the combined effect of these amino acids. This F6.51Y/I6.53T/P7.33T mutant showed approximately a 1000-fold reduced sensitivity for AVP, while it had a similar sensitivity for VT compared with the wild type receptor (Fig. 4C). This result is consistent with that obtained with the V1aR/VT1R(TMD6-C) chimera that showed a drastic decrease (about 1000-fold) in AVP sensitivity.Table IIIAVP and VT selectivities of mutant V1a and VT1 receptorsReceptors and mutantsEC50EmaxAVPVTAVPVTlog, mluc-fold activityRat V1aR wt-9.34 ± 0.19-8.70 ± 0.206.73 ± 0.305.38 ± 0.27Rat V1aR (F6.51Y)-7.28 ± 0.27aVersus wild type rat V1aR (p < 0.05)-8.64 ± 0.137.01 ± 0.718.55 ± 0.34Rat V1aR (I6.53T)-9.36 ± 0.16-9.21 ± 0.15aVersus wild type rat V1aR (p < 0.05)11.63 ± 0.1615.98 ± 0.66Rat V1aR (P7.33T)-8.10 ± 0.12aVersus wild type rat V1aR (p < 0.05)-8.60 ± 0.1211.58 ± 0.4912.51 ± 0.12Rat V1aR (I6.53T/P7.33T)-8.30 ± 0.14aVersus wild type rat V1aR (p < 0.05)-8.58 ± 0.103.41 ± 0.102.98 ± 0.07Rat V1aR (F6.51Y/I6.53T/P7.33T)-6.59 ± 0.09aVersus wild type rat V1aR (p < 0.05)-8.32 ± 0.11aVersus wild type rat V1aR (p < 0.05)16.39 ± 0.6717.82 ± 0.68bfVT1R wt-6.65 ± 0.14-8.71 ± 0.1219.38 ± 0.9718.43 ± 0.70bfVT1R (Y306(6.51)F)-6.70 ± 0.11-8.76 ± 0.1622.97 ± 1.0125.39 ± 1.26bfVT1R (T308(6.53)I)ND-8.25 ± 0.18bVersus wild type bfVT1R (p < 0.05)ND9.11 ± 0.51bfVT1R (N320(7.26)I)-6.09 ± 0.11-8.71 ± 0.0810.53 ± 1.0849.38 ± 1.15bfVT1R (I322(7.28)T)-6.58 ± 0.05-9.73 ± 0.0922.62 ± 0.7945.55 ± 1.06bfVT1R (T327(7.33)P)-7.45 ± 0.15bVersus wild type bfVT1R (p < 0.05)-9.71 ± 0.2817.83 ± 0.9622.79 ± 1.54bfVT1R (Y6.51F/T7.33P)-8.95 ± 1.83bVersus wild type bfVT1R (p < 0.05)-9.85 ± 0.17bVersus wild type bfVT1R (p < 0.05)54.74 ± 1.8358.83 ± 2.68bfVT1R (Y6.51F/T6.53I/T7.33P)-9.27 ± 0.16bVersus wild type bfVT1R (p < 0.05)-10.50 ± 0.16bVersus wild type bfVT1R (p < 0.05)33.01 ± 1.30439.99 ± 1.78a Versus wild type rat V1aR (p < 0.05)b Versus wild type bfVT1R (p < 0.05) Open table in a new tab In bfVT1R, individual reciprocal amino acids, Tyr306(6.51), Thr308(6.53), and Thr327(7.33), were replaced by those of rat V1aR. The Tyr6.51 → Phe mutation resulted in a slight increase in AVP sensitivity. The Thr6.53 → Ile mutation led to a significant decrease in both VT and AVP sensitivity. Interestingly the Thr7.33 → Pro mutation resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity to AVP (Fig. 5, A and B, and Table III). Three other mutants were constructed to determine the relative importance of the Thr304(6.49), Asn320(7.26), and Ile322(7.28) residues in bfVTR. The Thr6.49 → Ala mutation led to an impairment of receptor activity (data not shown). The Asn320(7.26) → Ile and the Ile322(7.28) → Thr mutations in ECL-3 had no effect in AVP sensitivity (Table III). As we observed increased ligand sensitivity for AVP in the Y6.51F and T7.33P mutants, we generated the double mutant Y6.51F/T7.33P. This double mutant showed a 100-fold increase in AVP sensitivity and a 10-fold increase in VT sensitivity (Fig. 5C). This is also comparable with that of the chimeric VT1R/V1a(TMD6-C) receptor. To examine the effect of Thr308(6.53) together with the Y6.51F and T7.33P mutations we constructed a triple bfVT1R mutant (Y6.51F/T6.53I/T7.33P). This mutant did not display significant change in AVP and VT sensitivity compared with the double bfVT1R mutant Y6.51F/T7.33P. Taken together, these results suggest that Ile/Thr6.53 in TMD VI is involved in VT selectivity, whereas the Phe/Tyr6.51 in TMD VI and Pro/Thr7.33 in TMD VII are important for the interaction with AVP. Ligand Sensitivity of Mutant Receptors for Agonists and Antagonists—To further elucidate the role of the Phe/Tyr6.51, Ile/Thr6.53, and Pro/Thr7.33 residues in differential ligand sensitivity, the sensitivity of wild type and mutant receptors for agonists and antagonists was also examined. First we studied the effects of the natural ligands OT and MT that act as partial agonists on V1aR and bfVT1R. The triple rat V1aR mutant F6.51Y/I6.53T/P7.33T showed reduced sensitivity to OT compared with wild type rat V1aR, but its sensitivity to MT remained unchanged (Fig. 6A and Table IV). On the other hand, the double bfVT1R mutant Y6.51F/T7.33P showed remarkably high sensitivity to OT and relatively higher sensitivity to MT compared with wild type bfVT1R (Fig. 6B and Table IV). Next we examined the relative activities of mammalian AVP/OT agonists and antagonists. The V1 agonist [Phe2,Orn8]OT and the V2 agonist [deamino-Cys1,Val4,d-Arg8]AVP activated wild type rat V1aR with similar potency, while the OT agonist [Thr4,Gly7]OT failed to activate rat V1aR in agreement with our previous result (25Acharjee S. Do-Rego J.L. Oh D.Y. Moon J.S. Ahn R.S. Lee K.S. Vaudry H. Kwon H.B. Seong J.Y. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 293-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast to rat V1aR, only [Phe2,Orn8]OT was potent to activate bfVT1R. Interestingly, like bfVT1R, the triple rat V1aR mutant F6.51Y/6.53T/P7.33T responded only to [Phe2,Orn8]OT (Fig. 6C and Table IV). Agonist selectivity of the double bfVT1R mutant Y6.51F/T7.33P was very similar to that of wild type bfVT1R (Fig. 6D and Table IV).Table IVAgonist and antagonist bindin"
https://openalex.org/W1978107156,"Around 50 mammalian and 15 yeast proteins are known to contain the phox (PX) domain, the majority (about 30) of which is classified as sorting nexins (SNXs). The PX domain, a hallmark of these proteins, is a conserved stretch of about 120 amino acids and is recently shown to mediate phosphoinositide binding. A few PX domain proteins (including some SNXs) have been shown to participate in diverse cellular processes such as protein sorting, signal transduction, and vesicle fusion. In this report, we present our results supporting a role of human IRAS to act as a SNX. The mouse homologue, previously identified as Nischarin, has been shown to interact with the α5 subunit of integrin and inhibit cell migration (Alahari, S. K., Lee J. W., and Juliano R. L. (2000) J. Cell Biol. 51, 1141-1154). Its human homologue (imidazoline receptor antisera-selected (IRAS)), on the other hand, contains an NH2-terminal extension and is a larger protein of 1504 amino acids consisting of an NH2-terminal PX domain, 5 putative leucine-rich repeats, a predicted coiled-coil domain, and a long COOH-terminal region. We show that it has the ability to homo-oligomerize via its coiled-coil region. The PX domain of IRAS is essential for association with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-enriched endosomal membranes. However, the PX domain of IRAS alone is insufficient for its localization to endosomes, unless the coiled-coil domain was included or it is artificially dimerized by glutathione S-transferase. Interaction of human IRAS with α5 integrin is not affected by the NH2-terminal extension, and overexpression of IRAS could cause a redistribution of surface α5 integrin to intracellular endosomal structures.

Regulation of vesicular trafficking, cell proliferation, receptor signaling, and other cellular functions may be exerted by controlling the recruitment of cytosolic proteins to their respective intracellular membrane compartments, via various protein domains capable of interaction with phosphorylated derivatives of phosphoinositides (PtdIns). 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphoinositide; PtdIns-3-P, phosphoinositide 3-phosphate; PX, phox domain; SNX, sorting nexin; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; IRAS, imidazoline receptor antisera-selected; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EEA1, early endosome autoantigen 1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescence protein; BFA, brefeldin A; HEK, human embryonic kidney; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; C-C, coiled-coil; PAK, p21-activated kinase; aa, amino acid(s); PE, phycoerythrin. 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphoinositide; PtdIns-3-P, phosphoinositide 3-phosphate; PX, phox domain; SNX, sorting nexin; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; IRAS, imidazoline receptor antisera-selected; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EEA1, early endosome autoantigen 1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescence protein; BFA, brefeldin A; HEK, human embryonic kidney; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; C-C, coiled-coil; PAK, p21-activated kinase; aa, amino acid(s); PE, phycoerythrin. This is mediated primarily by direct lipid-protein interaction with a large number of down-stream effector proteins containing specific lipid binding modules, such as the pleckstrin homology domain, the FYVE (for Fablp, YOTB, Vac1p, and EEA1) zinc finger, ENTH domain (Epsin NH2-terminal homology), and PX domain. The PX domain, consisting of 100-130 amino acids, was first identified from the sequence analysis of two SH3 domain-containing cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase, p47phox and p40phox (1Alahari S.K.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) The majority of proteins containing the PX domain have been classified as Sorting Nexins (SNXs) (2Ponting C.P.

SNX1 was isolated from a yeast two-hybrid screen using the cytoplasmic tail of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as bait (5Xu Y. Seet L-F. Hanson B. Hong W. Biochem. J. 2001; 15: 513-530Crossref Google Scholar). Searches of sequence databases with various PX domains have revealed the existence of more related proteins (3Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

So far, about 30 SNXs have been identified in mammalian cells (2Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 4Teasdale R.D. Loci D. Houghton F. Karlsson L. Gleeson P.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recent studies on SNXs have uncovered the roles of several of these proteins in membrane trafficking of plasma membrane receptors. SNX1 is involved in the down-regulation of EGFR (5Xu Y. Seet L-F.

Zhou Y. Szabo K. Haft C.R. Trejo J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1965-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe our characterization of human IRAS. IRAS was firstly isolated as an imidazoline-1 receptor candidate cloned by imidazoline receptor antisera-selected (IRAS) cDNA approach (9Wang Y. Zhou Y. Szabo K. Haft C.R. Trejo J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1965-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and was independently shown to be an interacting partner for insulin receptor substrate 4 (10Piletz J.E. Ivanov T.R. Sharp J.D. Ernsberger P. Chang C.H. Pickard R.T. Gold G. Roth B. Zhu H. Jones J.C. Baldwin J. Reis D.J. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). IRAS was recently reported to protect transfected PC12 cells from apoptosis (11Sano H. Liu S.C. Lane W.S. Piletz J.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19439-19447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), whereas its mouse homologue, Nischarin, which lacks the NH2-terminal PX domain, was identified as a cytosolic interacting protein for α5 integrin and shown to inhibit cell migration by inhibiting the ability of PAK1 to phosphorylate substrates (12Dontenwill M. Pascal G. Piletz J.E. Chen M. Baldwin J. Ronde P. Dupuy L. Urosevic D. Greney H. Takeda K. Bousquet P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 933-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Alahari S.K. Nasrallah H. Biochem. J. 2003; 377: 449-457Crossref Google Scholar). However, the basic cellular mechanism underlying the action of human IRAS is unknown, and our biochemical and cell biological characterizations of IRAS reveal its intrinsic property to associate with the endosomal compartments. The NH2-terminal PX domain binds specifically to PtdIns-3-P and is necessary for targeting to the early/sorting and recycling endosomes, a process dependent on homo-oligomerization mediated by a downstream C-C region. Furthermore, it associates with endogenous α5 integrin and causes a redistribution of this receptor for fibronectin from the cell surface to endosomal structures. These results suggest that human IRAS could function as an endosomal SNX regulating trafficking of proteins such as integrin. Plasmids and Recombinant Protein—Full-length human IRAS was obtained by PCR amplification of the entire coding region from human cDNA clone KIAA0975 (kindly provided by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute), using Primers I-1RCP1 and I-1RCP2 (Table I). The resulting 4512-bp PCR product was digested with XhoI and EcoRV, prior to ligation to the vector pDMyc-neo (14Seet L-F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and pre-cut with XhoI and SmaI. This led to the construction of pDmyc-IRAS. Similarly, pDmyc-IRASΔPX was constructed by PCR amplification of coding region from nucleotides 870 to 4585 of IRAS using Primers I-1RCP3 and I-1RCP2 (Table I) and ligated into XhoI- and SmaI-digested pDMyc-neo and pEGFPC3. Other myc epitope-tagged deletion mutants, including pD-myc-PX (nucleotides 1-399, pDmyc-PXext, pDmyc-PX-LRR, pDmyc-PX-CC, and pDmyc-PX-α5BD, were constructed by in a similar fashion except that downstream primers: I-1RCP4, I-1RCP6, I-1RCP8, I-1RCP10, and I-1RCP12, respectively, were used for amplification. The fragments were then subjected to XhoI and MluI digestion before cloning into XhoI and MluI-digested pDmycneo. pDmyc-PX was subjected to XhoI and SmaI digestion to yield a fragment of ∼400 bp fragment, which was subsequently cloned into XhoI/SmaI-digested pXJ-GST vector (15Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutation was introduced into the PX domain of IRAS using PCR products from I-1RCP1/RYVV2 and RYVV1/I-1RCP6 as templates for a second round of amplification with I-1RCP1/I-1RCP6. The resulting fragment was subjected to digestion with XhoI and SacI, before it was ligated to pDmyc-IRASΔPX digested with XhoI and EcoRV and cloned into XhoI and SmaI-digested pDMyc-neo and pEGFPC3. As for construction of plasmids for GST fusion proteins, PCR fragment encoding PX domain was generated using I-1RCPPX1 and I-1RCP6 and was digested with NcoI and SacI (position 397) before it was ligated into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences) cut with NcoI and SacI. DH5α cells were used for transformation and GST fusion proteins expression. Purification of GST fusion proteins was performed as described previously (16Lowe S.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 209-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides were ordered from Genset (Singapore).

For immunoprecipitation studies, 293T cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to 80% confluency and transfected with 2.4 μg of appropriate plasmids with Effectene Transfection Reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). For immunofluorescence studies, human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells), A431, and HeLa cells were typically grown on 22-mm2 coverslips overnight to 60% confluency and transfected as mentioned above. Antibodies—Rabbit anti-myc was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA), while mouse anti-GFP (B2), rabbit anti-α5 integrin (H-104) and rabbit anti-GST (Z5) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat polyclonal anti-GST antibody was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Antibodies against EEA1 (early endosome autoantigen 1), SNX2, GM130, and anti-CD49e were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-transferrin receptor hybridoma (OKT9) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The monoclonal antibody against human LAMP1 and CD63, developed by J. T. August and J. E. K. Hildreth, respectively, was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the University of Iowa (Department of Biological Science, Iowa City, IA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immuno-globulin (IgG) and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were all purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—After 18- to 24-h incubation, untransfected or transfected cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBSCM), and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4°C. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBSCM for 15 min at room temperature. All primary and secondary antibodies incubations were performed for 1 h at room temperature and were used at a 1:100 dilution in fluorescence dilution buffer (PBSCM with 5% normal goat serum, 5% fetal calf serum, and 2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6). The immunostained cells were viewed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Nikon) attached to a Radiance 2000 imaging system (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Transfected 293T cells were washed twice with PBS and spun down at 800 × g for 10 min. 1.2 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) was then added to the cells and left to lyse for 15 min on ice. Cell lysates were precleared at 13,000 rpm on a tabletop centrifuge. Typically, immunoprecipitation was carried out overnight at 4°C with 5 μg of anti-myc or anti-GFP antibody in the presence of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B or Protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. The beads were then washed six times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 150 mm NaCl. Proteins bound to beads were subjected to 4-min boiling in the presence of with Laemmli sample buffer. Meanwhile, 5% of cell lysate was used as input control. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto Hybond C+ nitrocellulose. Blots (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated in blocking buffer (5% skimmed milk and 10% fetal calf serum in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) for at least 1 h, before they were subjected to 1-h room temperature incubation with the appropriate primary antibodies, followed by three washes with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20). Antibodies bound to the blots were subsequently detected using Protein A-horseradish peroxidase (BD Transduction Laboratories) or peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies and the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescence Substrate (Pierce). Preparation of Total Cytosol and Membrane Fractions—Transfected 293T cells were harvested as mentioned above. 650 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgOAc, 1 mm dithio-threitol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) were added. 10 strokes of homogenization were applied to the ice-cold cells, using a 27-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe. Unlysed cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 4,500 rpm twice, and the precleared lysates were spun at 85,000 × g for 45 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer. Equal amounts of total cytosol and total membrane fractions were loaded into a 7% SDS-PAGE. Anti-GRP78 and anti-β-actin were used as membrane and cytosol makers, respectively. Protein/Lipid Overlay Assay—The protein/lipid overlay assays were performed as described previously (18Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol.

(Salt Lake City, UT) were pre-blocked overnight at 4°C with GST-PX domain fusion proteins (10 μg/ml) in PBST (0.05% Tween 20) with 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich). The next day, the strips were washed 6 times in PBST for 10 min each, and then incubated with a goat polyclonal anti-GST antibody for 1 h at room temperature, after which they were washed in PBST for 6 times again. The bound proteins were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. The strips were finally subjected to 12 washes in PBST before they were visualized using ECL-SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Flow Cytometric Analysis—A431 cells, grown and transfected with either pEGFPC3 vector or pEGFP-IRAS, were starved for 4 h and washed twice with PBS, before they were harvested. 1 × 106 cells were incubated on ice with 20 μl of R-PE-conjugated CD49e. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS before they were subjected to flow cytometry and analyzed using FACSVantage™ SE system (BD Biosciences) equipped with a 488-nm argon laser. Human IRAS Has an NH2-terminal PX Domain That Contributes to Its Membrane Association—SNXs are characterized by the presence of a PX domain (4Teasdale R.D. Loci D. Houghton F. Karlsson L. Gleeson P.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5Xu Y. Seet L-F. Hanson B. Hong W. Biochem. J. 2001; 15: 513-530Crossref Google Scholar). Some SNXs also possess one or more coiled-coil regions or other domains (3Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 5Xu Y. Seet L-F. Hanson B. Hong W. Biochem. J. 2001; 15: 513-530Crossref Google Scholar). One potential SNX, a PX domain-containing protein, is imidazoline-1 receptor candidate protein or IRAS (5Xu Y. Seet L-F. Hanson B. Hong W. Biochem. J. 2001; 15: 513-530Crossref Google Scholar, 10Piletz J.E. Ivanov T.R. Sharp J.D. Ernsberger P. Chang C.H. Pickard R.T. Gold G. Roth B. Zhu H. Jones J.C.

Takeda K. Bousquet P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 933-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison shows that the amino acid sequence of IRAS (12Dontenwill M. Pascal G. Piletz J.E. Chen M. Baldwin J. Ronde P. Dupuy L. Urosevic D. Greney H. Takeda K. Bousquet P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 933-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is about 80% identical to that of a previously identified mouse Nischarin (1Alahari S.K. Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 51: 1141-1154Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A illustrates the presence of an additional 244 amino acids in the NH2 terminus of the human protein in relation to the mouse protein. Coincidentally, these 244 amino acids were predicted to make up a PX domain at the NH2-terminal portion. Searching mouse and human genome sequences with Nischarin and IRAS suggests that these two proteins represent the same protein (IRAS/Nischarin) of different species. In addition, there exist many mouse expressed sequence tag clones that encode this NH2-terminal extension, suggesting that Nischarin could represent a truncated version of IRAS. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that endogenous Nischarin has a larger size than the polypeptide encoded by the Nischarin clone (1Alahari S.K. Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 51: 1141-1154Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to examine IRAS in the context of intact protein and to reconcile the results derived from truncated IRAS in the new context. Based on the fact that PX domain mediates interaction with endosomal PtdIns-3-P (3Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 5Xu Y. Seet L-F. Hanson B. Hong W. Biochem. J. 2001; 15: 513-530Crossref Google Scholar), we have first tested the importance of the additional NH2 terminus in subcellular distribution of human IRAS. We made constructs encoding the full-length IRAS from KIAA0975, as well as one that excludes the conserved sequence of the PX domain: IRASΔPX (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C shows the subcellular distribution of the full-length myc-tagged IRAS, and IRASΔPX. Immunofluorescence of the full-length protein exhibits a vesicular staining, whereas the PX domain-deleted version has a cytosolic staining, as does the mouse Nischarin (1Alahari S.K. Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 51: 1141-1154Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate that the PX domain is important for binding to membranes, total cytosol and membrane fractions were prepared from 293T cells expressing full-length and ΔPX forms. Fig. 1D shows that the full-length protein is found in both the cytosol as well as membrane fractions, whereas ΔPX could only be detected in the cytosolic fraction. These observations suggest that the membrane association and vesicular distribution of IRAS is dependent on the presence of a PX domain at its NH2 terminus.Fig. 1The NH2-terminal extension of human IRAS contains a Phox (PX) domain. A, the amino acid sequences of human IRAS and mouse Nischarin are aligned. Identical or conserved residues are shown in yellow. The pink box indicates the PX domain, while the second boxed region indicates the integrin α5 binding domain. Dashed lines indicate region missing in each protein. B, schematic representation of various domains in human (KIAA0975) and mouse (AF315344) IRAS predicted by the SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) program (21Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar). PX refers to the PX domain; LRR refers to leucine-rich repeats; CC refers to coiled-coil region; and α5-BD refers to the α5 integrin binding domain. Numbers represent amino acid positions. Schematic representation of a human IRAS mutant (IRASΔPX) with truncation of the PX domain is included in this diagram. C, the PX domain of human IRAS is required for targeting to punctate structures in mammalian cells. A431 cells were transfected with myc-IRAS or myc-IRASΔPX expressing constructs. As shown, full-length myc-IRAS resides to the punctate vesicular structures, whereas IRASΔPX exhibits cytosolic distribution. Bar, 10 μm. D, human IRAS exists in both cytosolic and membrane pools. Lysates of cells expressing myc-IRAS (lanes 1 and 2) or myc-IRASΔPX (lanes 3 and 4) were fractionated into cytosolic (C) (lanes 1 and 3) and membrane (M) (lanes 2 and 4) fractions. Approximately 30% of myc-IRAS is associated with membranes and the rest in the cytosolic fraction, while myc-IRASΔPX is detected only in the cytosol. The fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis for detection of the myc-tagged proteins (upper panel); GRP78 (luminal protein of the endoplasmic reticulum serving as a control for membrane fraction (38Patterson C.E. Schaub T. Coleman E.J. Davis E.C. Mol. Biol.

Western blots of cell lysates with anti-IRAS antibody (Fig. 2B) demonstrated the detection of a 190-kDa protein species from total lysates of untransfected (lane 1), untagged (lane 2), and myc-IRAS (lane 3) transfected 293 cells using anti-IRAS. Similarly, immunoprecipitation and detection of untransfected 293 cell lysates using anti-IRAS could pull down a protein of ∼190 kDa (lane 4), which also corresponds to the protein species precipitated from both untagged (lane 5) and myc-tagged (lane 6) IRAS. Immunoprecipitation of the same lysates using rabbit control IgG (lanes 7-9) did not result in the detection of any protein species. This indicates that IRAS exists in HEK 293 cells as a 190-kDa protein, which corresponds to the predicted size of the full-length IRAS. Human IRAS Is Enriched in the Early/Sorting and Recycling Endosomes—To investigate in which subcellular compartments human IRAS resides, HEK 293 cells (Fig. 3A, panels A, D, G, J, and M) were double-labeled with rabbit anti-IRAS with the following markers: EEA1 and SNX-2 (early/sorting endosomes; Fig. 3A, panels B and E), transferrin receptor (sorting and recycling endosomes, panel H); LAMP1 (late endosomes and lysosomes; panel K) and GM130 (cis-Golgi; panel N). Fig. 3A indicates that endogenous IRAS is localized in the early endosomal compartment, as indicated by EEA1 (panel C) and SNX2 (panel F) as well as recycling endosomal compartments, as indicated by internalized transferrin receptor (panel I). IRAS does not seem to co-localize with late endosome/lysosomal markers LAMP1 (panel L) and GM130 (panel O). To further support our observations on the subcellular localization, we transfected HeLa cells (which are flatter and larger than HEK 293 cells) with pDmyc-IRAS (panels A, E, I, M, and Q) and double-labeled myc-IRAS with the following markers: EEA1 and SNX-2 (early/sorting endosomes; panels B and F), transferrin receptor (sorting and recycling endosomes, panel J); LAMP1 (late endosomes and lysosomes, panel N), and GM130 (cis-Golgi, panel R). Fig. 3B shows that a significant population of myc-IRAS (panels C and G) was localized in the same compartment as EEA1 and SNX2, whereas some of the IRAS proteins are in the same structures as the internalized transferrin receptor, which represents the recycling endosomes (panel K). myc-IRAS seems to be best co-localized with SNX2 (panel H). On the other hand, poor co-localization with late endosome/lysosomal marker LAMP1 (panel O) was observed, whereas IRAS and GM130 seemed to be in different compartments (panel S). These observations suggest that a significant amount of myc-IRAS resides in early/sorting and recycling endosomes. Because some myc-IRAS is also localized to vesicular structures that are not marked by any of these endosomal/lysosomal markers, myc-IRAS may also reside in other domains/structures of the endosomes.Fig. 3Human IRAS is targeted to early/sorting and recycling endosomes but not to late endosomes/lysosomes or the Golgi apparatus. A, human embryonic kidney 293 cells grown on coverslips were processed for double-labeling using anti-IRAS antibodies and anti-EEA1 (A-C), anti-IRAS and anti-SNX2 (D-F), anti-IRAS and anti-transferrin receptor (G-I), myc-tag and LAMP1 (J-L), or myc-tag and GM130 (39Nakamura N.

We found that at the center of the fault, two sides of the fault surface coupled completely before the earthquake, with a coefficient of friction of 0.6, which is equivalent to strong crust.

https://openalex.org/W2117703525,"We find that phorbol ester (PE) treatment of K562 cells greatly stimulates promoters (T cell receptor beta, myeloperoxidase, macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor) containing AML1 transcription factor binding sites. This stimulation of AML1c transcriptional activity is mediated by direct phosphorylation of the AML1c molecule on multiple phosphorylation sites. Eleven AML1c (S/T)P sites in the transcriptional activating domain are phosphorylated at a basal level in untreated K562 cells; treatment of the K562 cells with PE results in increased phosphorylation at five of these sites (serines 276, 293, 303, 462, and threonine 300). Mutation of these five sites to alanine inhibits PE-induced transcriptional activity; mutation of the sites to an acidic amino acid, aspartic acid, stimulates constitutive activity. Single mutations in four amino acids or double mutations (serines 276 and 293 or threonine 300 and serine 303) have little effect on AML1c transcriptional activity. Inhibitor assays suggest that the ERK family of protein kinases is activated by PEs to phosphorylate the (S/T)P sites within the AML1c molecule and markedly enhance the transcriptional activity of AML1c."

Two cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies revealed large conformational changes upon binding of the RF2 to the ribosome (6Klaholz B.P. Pape T. Zavialov A.V. Myasnikov A.G. Orlova E.V. Vestergaard B. Ehrenberg M. van Heel M. Nature. 2003; 421: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 7Rawat U.B. Zavialov A.V. Sengupta J. Valle M. Grassucci R.A. Linde J. Vestergaard B. Ehrenberg M. Frank J. Nature. 2003; 421: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The separation between SPF and GGQ in RF2 extended to 61 Å in one cryo-EM study (6Klaholz B.P. Pape T. Zavialov A.V. Myasnikov A.G. Orlova E.V. Vestergaard B. Ehrenberg M. van Heel M. Nature. 2003; 421: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and to 73 Å in another cryo-EM study (7Rawat U.B. Zavialov A.V. Sengupta J. Valle M. Grassucci R.A. Linde J. Vestergaard B. Ehrenberg M. Frank J. Nature. 2003; 421: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The overall binding of the RF2 does not mimic tRNA, and it appears that the functional mimicry of the protein and the RNA is more convincing than a simple structural mimicry (2Nakamura Y. Ito K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 99-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Brodersen D.E. Ramakrishnan V. Nat. Struct.

Still, the distances between the two RNA signal binding motifs have to be around 73 Å for the Class I release factors. It was suggested that the eRF1 structure should also be adjusted to fit this range (6Klaholz B.P. Pape T. Zavialov A.V. Myasnikov A.G. Orlova E.V. Vestergaard B. Ehrenberg M. van Heel M. Nature. 2003; 421: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The question is then how do the termination release factors change their conformations to achieve conformity in their reversible ribosome binding? If the termination of protein synthesis involves similar mechanisms across species, there should probably be a similar mechanism controlling the conformational changes of Class I release factors. Here we have carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at room temperature to investigate the driving force of the conformational changes for the eRF1 and RF2. The simulations show remarkable differences between the conformational behavior with neutral and with protonated histidine (n-His and p-His) residues for both eRF1 and RF2. Sequence analysis indicates that these histidines are highly conserved. Our results clearly show that the conformations of both eRF1 and RF2 tend to keep near their respective crystal structures when the histidines are neutral. On the other hand, they change to their functional (cryo-EM) ribosome-bound forms when the histidines are protonated. Although the extent and direction of the conformational changes required for the eRF1 (shrinking from 97.5 to 73 Å) and RF2 (elongating from 33 to 73 Å) are very different, they nevertheless have a common underlying mechanism. Relaxed eRF1 has a shape remarkably similar to the ribosome-bound RF2, which encourages us to quantitatively assess the shape similarities among related molecules, including the RRF, the enlongation factor (EF-G and EF-Tu-tRNA complex), and eRF3. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the Charmm package (17Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13880) Google Scholar) and Charmm 27 force field (18MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S.

Long range electrostatic interactions were calculated with the PME method (19Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Physics. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20472) Google Scholar). The systems were kept in constant pressure ensembles (NPT) with the Hoover temperature control (20Hoover W.G. Phys. Rev. A. 1985; 31: 1695-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (15842) Google Scholar). The reference pressure was 1 atm, and the temperature was 300 K unless specified. The temperature of the simulation of eRF1 with neutral histidines was raised from 300 to 310 K after 3.6 ns in order to accelerate the conformational change. Still, the NIKS-GGQ separation is larger in the n-His form than in the p-His form of eRF1. The time step used was 2 fs, with a SHAKE constraint on all bonds containing hydrogen atoms. The protein crystal structures were used as starting point for the simulations. Sodium atoms were added to the water to make the overall simulation system free of net charge, which is required to properly compute electrostatic effects using the particle mesh Ewald method. The eRF1 structure (Protein Data Bank code 1dt9) has missing residues (positions 1–4, 334–342, 359–369, and 423–437), which were added into the system as random coils. The N-terminal (positions 1–4) and C-terminal (positions 423–437) residues are randomly extended from existing backbone coordinates. The missing loop (positions 334–342 and 359–369) residues are added, restricted by the loop connectivity, and minimized with the rest of the protein fixed. The simulated eRF1 systems include residues 1–437 and 21,143 TIP3 water molecules. The RF2 system includes the protein (Protein Data Bank code 1gqe) solvated with 14,125 water molecules. The crystal waters were included in the initial systems for both the eRF1 and RF2 simulations. Protein sequences were retrieved using the NCBI Blast server (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST), searching against the eRF1 and RF2 sequences. Sequences with identity higher than 90% were discarded in order to obtain a balanced conservation among the various species. The final sequences for eRF1 and RF2 (with an identity range of 25–90%) were realigned with ClustalX (21Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). The eRF1 is partitioned into three large domains and a hinge region (Fig. 1). Domain 1 contains residues 8–141, domain 2 includes residues 145–275, and domain 3 has residues 276–437. The hinge region is composed of residues 1–7 and 142–144. The interactions between two domains, domain A and domain B, are calculated as follows.ΔG(A, B)=(Ecol(A+B)+Esol(A+B))−(Ecol(A)+Esol(A))−(Ecol(B)+Esol(B))(Eq. 1) The protonation contribution of the domain interactions is evaluated according to the equation, ΔΔG(protonation)=ΔG(protonated histidine A, B)−ΔG(neutral histidine A, B)(Eq. 2) where Ecol is the coulombic interaction energy, and the Esol is the electrostatic contribution to the solvation energy. The solvation energies are calculated using the Generalized Born method with (standard) molecular volume (GBMV) (22Lee M.S. Feig M. Salsbury Jr., F.R. Brooks III, C.L. J. Comput. Chem. 2003; 24: 1348-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the interaction as accurately as possible, no distance cut-off is used, and the grid-based GBMV module is used. In the GBMV calculation, the dielectric constant of water is set to 80, and the Debye-Huckel ionic term is 0.2 to reflect the salt effect. The molecular similarity distance is evaluated using procedures adapted from Ankerst et al. (23Ankerst M. Kastenmuller G. Kriegel H.P. Seidl T. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1999; : 34-43PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The molecules are partitioned using combined models of shells and sectors (23Ankerst M. Kastenmuller G. Kriegel H.P. Seidl T. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1999; : 34-43PubMed Google Scholar). The atomic positions are converted to a polar coordinate system. The shell radius Ri is calculated by the equation, Ri=R*iS(Eq. 3) where R is the radius of the overall system, and S is the shell number. We use five and 10 shells. R is the distance from the average center to the most distant point in the molecular system. The angular space is 20° for 18*18 sectors and 10° for the 36*36 sectors. Therefore, the whole system is partitioned into 5*18*18 or 10*36*36 bins. Then the similarity distance is calculated using the quadratic form distance function as follows, SimDis(x,y)2=∑i=1,N∑j=1,Nαij(Xi−yi)(Xj−yj)(Eq. 4) aij=e−σd(i,j)(Eq. 5) d(i,j)=dr2(i,j)+dθ2(i,j)+dφ2(i,j)(Eq. 6) where X and Y are the number of heavy atoms in each bin for two molecules X and Y. It was reported that σ can range from 1 to 10. Here we used 10. The relative positions between two aligned molecules are optimized with a ste size of 1 Å of translation and 1° of rotation to minimize the similarity distance. The final similarity distance is normalized by the number of heavy atoms to allow comparison between various molecules. The Conformational Changes of eRF1—The structure of eRF1 has three domains (4Song H. Mugnier P. Das A.K. Webb H.M. Evans D.R. Tuite M.F. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Cell. 2000; 100: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1 and 3A). The NIKS motif locates in domain 1, in a loop linking two α-helices. The GGQ motif locates at the tip of domain 2, connecting a strand and a helix. Domains 1 and 2 are connected by a hinge around residue Asp142. N-terminal residues 1–7 also link domain 1 and contact with domain 2. Thus, the hinge area includes residues 1–7 and 142–144. Domain 3 is less structured than domains 1 and 2, with missing loops around residue His356 and the C terminus. Domain 3 connects with domain 2 via a kinked helix 8 (Fig. 3A). The separation of the NIKS and GGQ motifs in the eRF1 crystal structure is 97.5 Å, measured from the Ile-Cα to Gln-Ca. In our simulations in aqueous solutions, eRF1 with either neutral or charged histidine groups shows considerable conformational changes compared with the crystal conformation (Figs. 3 and 4). Domains 1 and 2 tend to bend closer to each other; however, the extent of bending depends on the charged states of the histidine groups. For eRF1 with n-His, the distance between the NIKS and GGQ motifs fluctuates around 90 Å (Figs. 3B and 4A, red line). For the p-His form, the separation may shrink to 70–75 Å (Figs. 3C and 4A, green line), which fits into the range needed for its functional binding with the ribosome (73 Å). The structural features that accompany the large fluctuations of domains 1 and 2 are very interesting. Consistent with the large separation of the NIKS-GGQ motif, the conformation of the n-His form (Fig. 4B, red line) is closer to the crystal structure, with a smaller r.m.s. deviation. Although the p-His form (Fig. 4B, green line) of eRF1 has much larger global motions than the eRF1 n-His, the change in the individual domains in the p-His form is similar to that of the n-His or even less (Supplementary Fig. 1). Domain 1 is very rigid for both n-His and p-His eRF1, with the r.m.s. deviation being around 1.5–2.0 Å (Supplemental Fig. 1A). Notably, domain 2 has a larger structural change in the n-His eRF1 (r.m.s. deviation 3 Å) than in the p-His eRF1 (r.m.s. deviation 2 Å; Supplemental Fig. 1B). Domain 3 has a large disordered region and is flexible in both (r.m.s. deviation 5 Å; Supplemental Fig. 1C). A “spring breaker” mechanism restricts the hinge motion of domain 2 in the n-His form of eRF1, as indicated in Fig. 3. Structurally, the motion of domain 2 is controlled by two flexible regions, one in the hinge strand of residues 140–143 and another in the middle of helix 8. The hinge strand is insensitive to the protonation of histidines, since it has similar dynamic behavior for both neutral and protonated forms (Supplemental Fig. 1E). In the crystal, helix 8 has a large kink in the middle, resulting in a bent helix. However, the distorted helix 8 gradually restores its perfect helical conformation in the neutral histidine form (Fig. 3B), effectively locking the hinge. The stretched helix now acts as a spring breaker to restrict the conformational fluctuation of the domain motion. If the histidines are protonated, the kinked region remains in the distorted state and functions as a flexible linker (Fig. 3C). The Conformational Changes of RF2—In contrast to the expanded binding epitopes of eRF1, the crystal structure of the bacterial polypeptide release factor RF2 is tightly packed (5Vestergaard B. Van L.B. Andersen G.R. Nyborg J. Buckingham R.H. Kjeldgaard M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1375-1382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Domain 1 of RF2 contains only a helical bundle. Domains 2 and 4 are one integrated unit with β-sheets wrapped around helix 5. Domain 3 is well packed with the core domain. The anticodon motif SPF and the peptidyltransferase center binding motif GGQ are located at the tips of the core domain and domain 3, respectively. We measure the separation of SPF and GGQ using the distance between Pro-Cα and Gln-Cα (32 Å). The nearest contact between the two motifs, measured between the side chain of Phe207 and Gly250, is only 23 Å. Simulation of the RF2 with neutral histidines leads to an even more compact conformation (Fig. 5B). Initially, there is a slight increase in the SPF-GGQ distance. However, it shrinks from 40 to 25 Å and fluctuates around the 30-Å range (Fig. 4C, red line). The crystal structure of the GGQ loop (residues 247–257) was modeled based on crystal packing, due to the poor electron density resolution (5Vestergaard B. Van L.B. Andersen G.R. Nyborg J. Buckingham R.H. Kjeldgaard M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1375-1382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The fluctuation observed in our MD simulations could reflect its native state property. Other parts of the RF2 are quite stable, with only a slight twist away from the crystal structure. Again, a profound structural change occurs for the RF2, when the histidines are protonated (Fig. 5C). The SPF-GGQ distance constantly increases from the beginning of the simulation and reaches 50 Å in about 2.5 ns (Fig. 4C, green line). There is a simultaneous change in the SPF-GGQ distance and a large twist of domain 1 at around 1 ns (Supplemental Fig. 2). The final shape of the extended RF2 is halfway between the crystal structure (5Vestergaard B. Van L.B. Andersen G.R. Nyborg J. Buckingham R.H. Kjeldgaard M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1375-1382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and the structure observed in the cryo-EM (6Klaholz B.P. Pape T. Zavialov A.V. Myasnikov A.G. Orlova E.V.

Nature. 2003; 421: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), as indicated in the superposition of the three structures in Fig. 6 (crystal structure (blue ribbon), cryo-EM structure (green ribbon), and structure from MD (red ribbon)). The structural extension of the SPF-GGQ observed in our simulation is achieved mainly through a large flip of the loop containing the GGQ motif. The helix arm is twisted only slightly and keeps its compact contact with the core domain. The movement of domain 1 is achieved mainly by bending the α1, α2, and α4 helices. A large kink links α1 and α2. The α4 helix is hinge-linked with the core domain. Thus, in our MD simulations, α2 and half of α3 still keep their original position, whereas α1, α4, and half of α3 move to the conformation observed in the cryo-EM (6Klaholz B.P. Pape T. Zavialov A.V.

Conservation of Histidine in eRF1 and RF2—The conformational sensitivity of eRF1 and RF2 to the protonation state of histidine may be traced to their enrichment in charged residues. 27% of the eRF1 residues are charged. For RF2, charged residues constitute as much as 32%. The charge distributions in the proteins are uneven. The eRF1 domain 1 and the GGQ minidomain are positive, whereas part of domain 2 and most of domain 3 have a larger number of negative charges (Fig. 1). RF2 domain 1 is highly negative. Sequential alignments of the RF1 and RF2 proteins indicate that many of the charged residues are conserved (Fig. 7). The highly uneven charge distribution between the domains indicates that the interdomain electrostatic interactions may affect the proteins' function (24Frolova L.Y. Merkulova T.I. Kisselev L.L. RNA. 2000; 6: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is known that mutating a conserved Glu changes the function of the release factors (25Uno M. Ito K. Nakamura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1819-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, the protonation state of histidines can be crucial, by modulating the charge distributions in the domains. Indeed, sequence alignments show that certain critical histidines within the charged residues' environments are conserved in both RF1 and RF2 (Fig. 7). For RF1, three are highly conserved (Figs. 1 and 3A). His132 is located in the center of domain 1. His180 and His189 are near the GGQ motif in domain 2. His180 is only two residues away from the Gly183-Gly184-Gln185 motif. The less conserved His170 is also in domain 2. Domain 3 has three unconserved His residues located in the disordered region. Histidines are even more conserved in the RF2. All five histidines in the RF2 are highly conserved (Fig. 5A) and are located near the two critical SPF and GGQ motifs. Again, GGQ is directly connected to a histidine (His253). Histidine conservation suggests direct functional roles, and it was postulated that His132 in eRF1 may be involved in codon binding as well (26Inagaki Y. Blouin C. Doolittle W.F. Roger A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we propose that conserved histidines may also modulate the protein conformation. Mechanism of Conformational Change of eRF1: Electrostatic Analysis of a Molecular Machine—To understand the mechanism and driving force of the conformational changes, we compute the histidine protonation energies and the interaction energies among the domains of eRF1 (Figs. 1 and 8, 9, 10). We choose 170 structures from our MD trajectory of eRF1 with protonated histidines, to sample the conformational distributions from the open to the closed forms. Among these conformations, there are 52 open conformers (with NIKS-GGQ distance of >90 Å), 58 intermediates (with NIKS-GGQ distances between 80 and 90 Å), and 60 closed conformers (with NIKS-GGQ distance of <80 Å). For each structure, we compute the effect of protonation on the overall energy, the electrostatic contribution to the domain-domain interaction (ΔG; Equation 1), and the protonation effect on the interdomain interaction (ΔΔG; Equation 2). We also studied 49 conformations from the MD trajectory of eRF1 with neutral histidines, for which most of the structures are in the open state (Fig. 3B).Fig. 9Electrostatic contributions to the domain 1-domain 2 interaction in eRF1. Neutral histidine forms are shown as follows: coulombic interaction (A); solvation contribution (B); overall electrostatic interaction, ΔG = ΔEcoulombic + ΔEsolvation (C).

https://openalex.org/W2159109033,"Metal ion transport by DCT1, a member of the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein family, is driven by protons. The stoichiometry of the proton to metal ion is variable, and under optimal transport conditions, more than 10 protons are co-transported with a single metal ion. To understand this phenomenon better, we used site-directed mutagenesis of DCT1 and analyzed the mutants by complementation of yeast suppressor of mitochondria import function-null mutants and electrophysiology with Xenopus oocytes. The mutation F227I resulted in an increase of up to 14-fold in the ratio between metal ions to protons transported. This observation suggests that low metal ion to proton transport of DCT1 resulting from a proton slippage is not a necessity of the transport mechanism in which positively charged protons are driving two positive charges of the metal ion in the same direction. It supports the idea that the proton slippage has a physiological advantage, and the proton slip was positively selected during the evolution of DCT1.

Xenopus oocytes have a very low metal ion uptake background, which makes them the ideal heterologous expression system for metal ion transporters. In addition to the uptake measurements of the various divalent cations, it is possible to analyze the electrophysiological parameters generated by imposed potentials in the transporter-expressing oocyte as compared with control (10Wright E.M. Loo D.D. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Lostao M.P. Hirayama B.H. Mackenzie B. Boorer K. Zampighi G. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 197-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The studies of DCT1 and Smf1p demonstrated that both of them function as general divalent metal ion transporters and that a proton gradient is the driving force for the metal ion transport (8Gunshin H.

However, the transport of protons and metal ions is “loosely coupled” because the process exhibits a variable stoichiometry. At pH 7 and membrane potentials of –90 to –30 mV, DCT1 transports one Fe2+ ion with one H+. At high proton concentration (low pH), the number of H+ ions transported with one Fe2+ ion increased to 10 (8Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2666) Google Scholar). Moreover, on changing the membrane potential from +10 to –80 mV at this low pH, the number of H+ ions transported with one Fe2+ ion increased from 3 to ∼18 (9Chen X-Z. Peng J.-B. Cohen A. Nelson H. Nelson N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35089-35094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In DCT1, this phenomenon was defined as a metal ion-dependent proton slippage (1Nelson N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4361-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 9Chen X-Z. Peng J.-B. Cohen A.

Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast to DCT1, Smf1p showed a metal ion-independent sodium slip through the proton-translocating pathway (9Chen X-Z.

Biol. 2001; 204: 1053-1061PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of this phenomenon is not well characterized, and the sites on the transporters that generate it are not known. In this work, we addressed the coupling between proton and metal ion transport, and report on a mutation in DCT1 that exhibits an ∼14-fold increase in the ratio of metal ion to proton transport. Site-directed Mutagenesis of DCT1—Oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis was performed by overlapping nucleotides with the mutation using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method (13Noumi T. Beltrán C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The DCT1 cDNA was cloned into pSPORT1 plasmid and was used as a template for PCR mutagenesis. NdeI and SpeI restriction sites were introduced at positions 145 and 1719 of the DCT1 reading frame (12Sacher A. Cohen A. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1053-1061PubMed Google Scholar). This resulted in the substitutions G50M, S573T, and V574S, which did not change the properties of DCT1. The mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis. The cRNAs of DCT1 and the mutants were synthesized by in vitro transcription from their cDNAs. Oocytes were injected with 50 μl of water containing 50 ng of cRNA. Oocyte Preparation and Uptake Measurements—Xenopus laevis oocytes were handled as described previously (12Sacher A. Cohen A. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1053-1061PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake experiments were performed 1–4 days following injections. The uptake solution for radiotracer experiments contained 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm Mes, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm l-ascorbic acid, and the pH was adjusted to 5.5 with Tris base. Usually, 20 oocytes were incubated in 0.5 ml of a solution containing 55FeCl2, 54MnCl2, 65ZnCl2, or 60CoCl2. The radioactive tracer was usually mixed with 7–20 μm unlabeled metal ion, and the uptake was followed for 30 min. The numbers given under “Results” are background-corrected and expressed in specific activity (pmol/oocyte/h). Electrophysiological Experiments—Experiments utilizing the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique were performed as described previously (14Loo D.D. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M.

Biol. 2001; 204: 1053-1061PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the pre-steady-state currents, the current traces were fitted to I(t) = I1 exp(–t/τ1) + I2 exp(–t/τ2) + Iss, where I1 is a capacitative current with time constant τ1 associated with the oocyte plasma membrane (τ1 is also observed in non-injected control oocytes), I2 is a transient current associated with DCT1 expression with time constant t2, and Iss is the steady-state current. The parameters τ1, τ2, I1, I2, and Iss were allowed to vary in all fits. The transient charge movements Q were obtained from the time integrals of Itransient (t) = I2 exp(–t/τ2) during the on and off responses for all depolarizing and hyperpolarizing potentials and fitted by the Boltzmann equation, Q = Qmax/{1 + exp[(V – V0.5)zF/RT]} + Qhyp, where Qmax represents the total charge movement, z represents the effective valence, V0.5 represents the midpoint of the charge distribution, and Qhyp represents the charge movement for extreme hyperpolarizing potentials (14Loo D.D.

Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). R, T, and F are the usual thermodynamic constants. Simultaneous Voltage-clamped Tracer and Current Measurements— Before the start of tracer uptake, the oocyte was clamped at –50 mV and perfused (washed) with substrate-free solution (that described above). After the perfusion was stopped, 50 μl of the uptake solution containing 55Fe2+ (55FeCl2 mixed with 20 μm unlabeled FeCl2 to a final concentration of 26 μm) were added manually using a pipette, which washed out the substrate-free solution. The uptake lasted 3 min in the chamber, which volume was ∼50 μl. To avoid dehydration, 1.5 min after the uptake began, another 50 μl of uptake solution was added. The uptake was terminated by perfusing the oocyte with the substrate-free solution. Currents were continuously measured during uptake. The oocyte was then dissolved in 50 μl of 10% SDS mixed with 4.5 ml of scintillation mixture, and the uptake activity was measured. The transported charge was calculated by integrating the Fe2+-evoked current over the uptake period (3 min). Next, the charge:uptake and the metal ion to proton ratios were calculated. The transported charge (C, coulomb) was converted to the number of electric charges (1 C = 6.24 × 1018e–) and the uptake (pmol/oocyte/3 min) was converted to the number of Fe2+ ions that were transported (multiplying by Avogadro's number). It has been shown that DCT1 and Smf1p function as general divalent metal ion transporters in mammals and yeast, respectively. Both use protons as their motive force to transport a broad-range of the same divalent metal ions and exhibit similar affinities for their various substrates (8Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V.

A. 2003; 100: 10694-10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The null mutant smf1Δ is unable to grow in the presence of EGTA. Expression of Smf1p or the mammalian transporter DCT1 suppresses the above phenotype and allows growth of the yeast mutant in the presence of EGTA (18Cohen A. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33388-33394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Despite the relatively high homology, there are a few known differences between DCT1 and Smf1p. The most striking one is in the slips generated by the transporters, H+ slip through DCT1 and Na+ slip through Smf1p (11Nelson N. Sacher A. Nelson H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The differences between the two homologues have to be due to the non-conserved amino acids in both proteins. Consequently, to locate the sites on the transporters responsible for this phenomenon, we substituted amino acids in DCT1 for the corresponding ones residing in Smf1p (19Cohen A. Nevo Y. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10694-10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been found that a mutation in the conserved glycine at position 216 (G216R) in the putative TM4 of DCT1 causes microcytic anemia in mk–/– mice and Belgrade rats (20Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C. II I Su M.A. Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrew N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). This mutation was subsequently shown to result in loss of Fe2+ transport ability (21Fleming M.D. Romano M.A. Su M.A. Garrick L.M. Garrick M.D. Andrews N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). This suggests that the TM4 may have an important biological function. Therefore, we mutated the Phe-227 of DCT1, located in the same TM, to the corresponding isoleucine residue of Smf1p. The properties of the mutant were analyzed by expression in Xenopus oocytes, where measurements of uptake activity and electrophysiological parameters of the oocytes expressing the mutated transporter were recorded. In addition, the DCT1 mutant was tested for complementation of EGTA sensitivity of the Smf1p null mutants. Metal Ion Uptake Activity of DCT1 and F227I Mutant—The uptake activity of Zn2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ into the Xenopus oocytes expressing DCT1 and the F227I mutant is exhibited in Fig. 1. The data are representative of three experiments with oocytes from different frogs. The mutation did not result in any significant changes in uptake activity or specificity to the different metal ions, except for a small decrease in Co2+ uptake. Therefore, it was not surprising that the F227I mutant retained the capability to suppress the growth arrest of the yeast null mutant smf1Δ in the presence of EGTA. 2A. Cohen, unpublished results. We generated more than thirty amino acid substitutions in DCT1, none of which exhibited the properties of F227I substitution described below. Pre-steady-state Currents of DCT1 and the Mutation F227I—At pH 5.5 and a millisecond time scale, oocytes expressing DCT1 exhibited pre-steady-state currents, mainly at positively imposed potentials (8Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2666) Google Scholar, 19Cohen A. Nevo Y. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10694-10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Pre-steady-state currents are an excellent indication of the expression level of transporters in Xenopus oocytes (10Wright E.M. Loo D.D. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Lostao M.P. Hirayama B.H. Mackenzie B. Boorer K. Zampighi G. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 197-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The magnitude of the pre-steady-state currents recorded in oocytes injected with cRNA of native DCT1 or the mutant F227I (Fig. 2, A and C) indicated similar expression levels of the two transporters. To characterize the features of the F227I mutant, we subtracted the capacitative and steady-state currents to yield the transient current (Q) (Fig. 3B). At each applied voltage, time integration of the off transients yielded the charge moved. The charge-voltage (Q-V) relationship obtained (data not shown) was fitted to a single Boltzmann function (see “Materials and Methods”), and Qmax of 43 nC and V0.5 of 42 mV were determined. Similar Qmax of 43 nC and a little higher V0.5 of 49 mV were determined for native DCT1 (Fig. 3A). The time constant τ of the pre-steady-state current decay in F227I, in the potential jump from –25 to +50 mV, was 35 ms for the on response and 23 ms for the off response, and in DCT1, τ was 43 and 26 ms, respectively. According to the Qmax, ∼2.5 × 1011 transporters were expressed on the plasma membrane of each oocyte expression DCT1 or F227I mutant. This calculation was made based on the mechanistic concept of transient charge movements in ion-coupled transporters that was proposed by Wright and co-workers (14Loo D.D. Hazama A. Supplisson S.

Essentially, the pre-steady-state current results from imposed potential induction of occlusion and release of protons by DCT1 in the absence of substrate (1Nelson N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4361-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The small decrease in V0.5 and in τon of the mutation could indicate a small decrease in the affinity of the transporter to protons.Fig. 3Pre-steady-state charge movements were obtained from the total currents shown inFig. 2by subtraction of the capacitative and steady-state currents, using the fitted method (see “Materials and Methods”).

At pH 5.5 and –80 mV, the coupling between H+ and Fe2+ is interrupted, and the charge:uptake ratio is ∼18 (9Chen X-Z. Peng J.-B. Cohen A. Nelson H. Nelson N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35089-35094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The steady-state currents in those conditions are therefore mainly because of the protons transported (8Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2666) Google Scholar, 9Chen X-Z. Peng J.-B. Cohen A. Nelson H. Nelson N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35089-35094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The addition of Mn2+ to oocytes expressing the mutation F227I did abolish the pre-steady-state currents and generated only small steady-state currents compared with DCT1 (Fig. 2, B and D). At –125 mV, the addition of 0.1 mm Mn2+ induced an inward positive current of ∼350 nA for DCT1 and a current of ∼20 nA for the F227I mutant. Simultaneous Measurement of Iron-induced Currents and Uptake Activity in DCT1 and the Mutation F227I—To further investigate these findings, we simultaneously measured the iron-induced currents and 55Fe2+ uptake. First, the pre-steady-state currents were recorded in DCT1 and F227I expression oocytes that were bathed in substrate-free solution, pH 5.5 (Fig. 4A and C). The wild-type DCT1 and F227I mutant exhibited similar pre-steady-state currents. Addition of solution containing 20 μm of FeCl2 resulted in the disappearance of the pre-steady-state currents and induced a steady-state current (Fig. 4, B and D). Fig. 5D shows the currents generated at different imposed potentials on DCT1 and its F227I mutant by the addition of FeCl2. At –125 mV, the addition of Fe2+ induced a steady-state current of ∼650 nA for DCT1 and only 75 nA for F227I mutant. Similar phenomenon was recorded between –25 and –125 mV. To analyze the amounts of charge movement in relation to metal ion uptake, we simultaneously traced the charge movement and 55Fe2+ uptake in oocytes clamped at –50 mV. Fig. 5 shows the results of five different oocytes injected with DCT1 or F227I mutant. The charges that were transported during the 3-min exposure to 26 μm Fe2+ were 25 μC and 2.3 μC, and the uptake activities were 7.25 pmol/oocyte/3 min and 5.4 pmol/oocyte/3 min for DCT1 and F227I, respectively. The charge:uptake ratio under these conditions (pH 5.5 and membrane potential of –50 mV) was calculated (see “Materials and Methods”) to be 36 for DCT1 and 4.4 for the F227I mutant. Because each Fe2+ contributes two charges and each proton one charge, the number of protons transported with each metal ion is 34 for DCT1 and 2.4 for the F227I mutation. Hence, the mutation exhibits a 14-fold increase in the ratio of metal ion to proton transported. These observations suggest that the mutation F227I almost abolished the proton slip through DCT1 without statistically significant change in the metal ion transport activity.Fig. 5Simultaneous measurement of iron-induced currents and uptake activity into X. laevis oocytes expressing DCT1 and the F227I mutant.

Moreover, Zn2+ inhibits Fe2+ and Mn2+ uptakes in oocytes expressing DCT1 or Smf1p and in yeast cells expression Smf1p (5Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, in previous studies, we could not detect 65Zn2+ uptake into Xenopus oocytes expressing DCT1 or Smf1p (12Sacher A. Cohen A. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1053-1061PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cohen A. Nevo Y. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10694-10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These observations were in line with results from other studies with DCT1 expressed in Caco-2 TC7 cells, which suggest that Zn2+ is not transported by DCT1 (23Tandy S. Williams M. Leggett A. Lopez-Jimenez M. Dedes M. Ramesh B. Srai S.K. Sharp P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We therefore concluded that Zn2+ binds to the transporter, probably to the same site as the other metal ions, and generates the proton slip through DCT1 but does not transport. In this work, we contradicted our previous findings, since we recently detected 65Zn2+ uptake into oocytes expressing DCT1, in agreement with the recently published data by Marciani et al. (24Marciani P. Trotti D. Hediger M.A. Monticelli G. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 197: 92-99Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As depicted in Figs. 1 and 6A, the values of 65Zn2+ uptake activity were ∼10 pmol/oocyte/h. We measured the uptake activity of Fe2+ and Zn2+ during various days after the injection of DCT1 cRNA to the oocytes (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6C, the ratio between Zn2+ and Fe2+ uptake was altered during the various days, from ∼3% on the first day to ∼30% on the fourth day. The ratio between Mn2+ and Fe2+ was also altered, from 30% on the first day to 116% on the fourth day (data not shown). Although Fe2+ uptake activity reached steady-state 2 days after injection, Zn2+ and Mn2+ uptake activities continued to rise even 4 days after injection. The data are representative of four experiments with oocytes from different frogs. Reduction of the amount of cRNA that was injected into the oocytes, to an amount that is under the saturation level, did indeed reduce the uptake activity but did not change these ratios (data not shown). This phenomenon did not occur when we measured the uptakes of two substrates, GABA and betaine, by the GABA transporter GAT3. 3E. Kfir, unpublished results. These results can be explained either by oligomerization or by conformation changes in DCT1 that occur during the time of its presence in the plasma membrane, which altered the specificity of the transporter to the various substrates. The family of NRAMP metal ion transporters plays a major role in metal ion homeostasis (2Forbes J.R. Gros P. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 3Van Ho A. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Annu. Rev.

A. 1995; 92: 10089-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We developed a concerted approach to the study of Smf1p and DCT1. It employs yeast null mutants lacking the SMF metal ion transporters (18Cohen A. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33388-33394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and Xenopus oocytes as an expression system for Smf1p and DCT1 (12Sacher A. Cohen A. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1053-1061PubMed Google Scholar). Using this approach, we investigated the first external loop of DCT1. The properties of various mutants in this region suggest that loop 1 is involved in the metal ion binding and its coupling to the proton-driving force (19Cohen A. Nevo Y. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10694-10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One of the prominent mechanistic properties of these transporters is the proton slip through DCT1 and the Na+ slip through Smf1p (11Nelson N. Sacher A. Nelson H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Under conditions of neutral pH and/or neutral membrane potential, DCT1 would be in the coupled state; that is, the stoichiometry of proton:metal ion transport would be close to 1:1. Increasing the driving force, by either reducing the pH or increasing the negative potential, generates a proton slip, which maintains the levels of substrate transport at rates that are close to the “normal” rates of the coupled state. However, it simultaneously increases the rate of proton movement through the transporter. A similar mechanism applies to Smf1p-mediated slippage, except that here the ion that slips is Na+. Metal ion transport by Smf1p is also driven by proton motive force, and inhibition of the latter by Na+ results in reduced metal ion uptake. The physiological significance of this phenomenon in metal ion transporters could be protection of cells against the excessive transporting of these elements. Such a mechanism is necessary when cells are exposed to conditions of abundant metals and acidic environment. The mechanism of this phenomenon is not well characterized, and the sites on the transporters generating this phenomenon are not known. To locate these sites, we attempted to gain control over the slippage magnitude by reciprocal amino acid substitution between DCT1 and Smf1p. We managed to diminish the proton slip through DCT1 by substituting a single amino acid (F227I). This mutation did not generate any Na+ slip, and the transporter properties were not influenced by the removal of Na+ from the medium (not shown). The amino acid Phe-227 is located in the putative TM4 of DCT1 that may be situated in close proximity to the proton pathway of the transporter. This notion is in line with a previous study that demonstrated the importance of TM4 for the function of the transporter (20Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C. II I Su M.A. Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrew N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 21Fleming M.D. Romano M.A. Su M.A. Garrick L.M. Garrick M.D. Andrews N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The mutation F227I did not result in any significant changes in the uptake activity or specificity of the different metal ions, except for a small decrease in Co2+ uptake. It was therefore not surprising that the F227I mutant retained the capability to suppress the growth arrest of smf1Δ in a medium containing EGTA. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the Qmax value of the F227I mutant was comparable with that of native DCT1, indicating that the expression levels of the mutant are similar to those of the native DCT1. The coupling between the driving force and substrate transport may be modulated by different physiological conditions (11Nelson N. Sacher A. Nelson H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, for most of the transporters studied so far, a fixed number of driving ions are reported to cross the transmembrane per the single substrate molecule that is transported (26McGivan J.D. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 27Inoue K. Fei Y.J. Zhuang L. Gopal E. Miyauchi S. Ganapathy V. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 86-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Even for proliferated families of transporters, such as the Na+/Cl– neurotransmitter transporters, stoichiometric amounts of Na+, Cl–, and substrate are reported (30Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 31Keynan S. Suh Y-J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G.

Different transporters in this family operate with unique stoichiometries, and some of them even utilize K+ as part of the driving force (34Rudnick G. Nelson P.J.

In contrast, transporters such as the Escherichia coli lactose permease were reported to operate with a fixed stoichiometry of 1 for the symport of proton and lactose (37Sahin-Tóth M. Karlin A. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10729-10732Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Studies involving site-directed mutagenesis yielded numerous mutants in which the properties of proton and/or the substrate transport were modified (19Cohen A. Nevo Y. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10694-10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Kaback H.R. Sahin-Toth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Mol.

One of these mutants, E269D, is of particular interest to this discussion (40Weinglass A.B. Whitelegge J.P. Hu Y. Verner G.E. Faull K.F. Kaback H.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1467-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 41Franco P.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7379-7386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ujwal M.L.

This delicate mutation, which changed the position of a carboxylic acid by 1.5 A, led to a few changes in the transport properties of lactose permease. The changes included reduction of the coupling between proton to lactose transport, such that ∼10 protons had to cross the transporter for each lactose. This proton slippage is comparable with the native slip of DCT1. The mild mutation F227I in DCT1 resulted in marked reduction in the proton slip through DCT1 and essentially mimicked the reversal of the E269D mutation in lactose permease (40Weinglass A.B.

The effect of the F227I mutation may also be analogous to the one of E269D, except that in the former it may induce a conformational change that cancels the slip that was evolutionarily selected for the benefit of the physiology of metal ion transport in the mammalian duodenum (11Nelson N. Sacher A. Nelson H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to identify the proton translocation pathway that was influenced by the F227I mutation in DCT1."
https://openalex.org/W2164727209,"Activins and inhibins compose a heterogeneous subfamily within the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of growth and differentiation factors with critical biological activities in embryos and adults. They signal through a heteromeric complex of type II, type I, and for inhibin, type III receptors. To characterize the affinity, specificity, and activity of these receptors (alone and in combination) for the inhibin/activin subfamily, we developed a cell-free assay system using soluble receptor-Fc fusion proteins. The soluble activin type II receptor (sActRII)-Fc fusion protein had a 7-fold higher affinity for activin A compared with sActRIIB-Fc, whereas both receptors had a marked preference for activin A over activin B. Although inhibin A and B binding was 20-fold lower compared with activin binding to either type II receptor alone, the mixture of either type II receptor with soluble TGF-β type III receptor (TβRIII; betaglycan)-Fc reconstituted a soluble high affinity inhibin receptor. In contrast, mixing either soluble activin type II receptor with soluble activin type I receptors did not substantially enhance activin binding. Our results support a cooperative model of binding for the inhibin receptor (ActRII·sTβRIII complex) but not for activin receptors (type II + type I) and demonstrate that a complex composed of activin type II receptors and TβRIII is both necessary and sufficient for high affinity inhibin binding. This study also illustrates the utility of this cell-free system for investigating hypotheses of receptor complex mechanisms resulting from crystal structure analyses.

Activins A and B, members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; ActR, activin receptor; TβR, TGF-β receptor; ECD, extracellular domain; s, soluble; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein. superfamily of growth and differentiation factors, have a variety of actions in both embryonic and adult tissues, including tissue fate determination in vertebrate embryos, regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone biosynthesis in pituitary gonadotrophs, and regulation of gametogenesis in ovaries and testes (reviewed in Ref. 1Welt C. Sidis Y. Keutmann H. Schneyer A. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 724-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Although five vertebrate activin genes have been identified (βA–βE), only activins A (βA subunit homodimer) and B (βB subunit homodimer) have experimental evidence supporting biological roles in vivo (2Chang H. Brown C.W. Matzuk M.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 787-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), although a role for activin C was recently proposed in the liver (3Wada W. Maeshima A. Zhang Y.Q. Hasegawa Y. Kuwano H. Kojima I. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E247-E254Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When examined in vitro, recombinant activins A and B appear to have similar biological activities (4Mason A.J. Berkemeier L.M. Schmelzer C.H. Schwall R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1352-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 5Sidis Y. Tortoriello D.V. Holmes W.E. Pan Y. Keutmann H.T. Schneyer A.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, in vivo, disruption of the mouse βA gene results in early neonatal lethality with craniofacial defects and lack of whiskers, suggesting that activin A is critical for normal mammalian development (6Matzuk M.M. Kumar T.R. Vassilli A. Bickenbach R.R. Roop D.R. Jaenisch R. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 374: 354-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In contrast, disruption of the βB gene is not lethal but results in fertility defects in homozygous knockout females related to inability to nurse newborn pups (7Vassalli A. Matzuk M.M. Gardner H.A. Lee K.F. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 414-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Interestingly, replacement of the βA mature coding sequence with that from the βB gene, resulting in activin B production wherever activin A or B would be synthesized in wild-type animals, rescues many of the skeletal abnormalities of the activin A knockout but still results in fertility defects and growth retardation, indicating that activin B cannot completely compensate for activin A even when expressed in an identical fashion (8Brown C.W. Li L. Houston-Hawkins D.E. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2404-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Brown C.W. Houston-Hawkins D.E. Woodruff T.K. Matzuk M.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that the two activins subserve at least some non-overlapping functions in the adult, although the mechanism whereby this differential activity is manifested remains unclear. One possible explanation is that distinct subsets of activin receptors may differentially bind activins A and B, at least in some tissues. The wide distribution of activin A and B expression in the adult suggests that they primarily act as autocrine or paracrine signals. On the other hand, inhibin, a heterodimeric molecule composed of one of the activin βA or βB subunits linked to a distantly related α subunit to produce inhibin A or B, respectively, was originally discovered as an endocrine regulator of follicle-stimulating hormone biosynthesis, being synthesized primarily in gonadal tissues and acting on pituitary gonadotrophs (reviewed in Ref. 10Vale W. Rivier C. Hsueh A. Campen C. Meunier H. Bicsak T. Vaughan J. Corrigan A. Bardin W. Sawchenko P. Spiess J. Rivier J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1988; 44: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar). Specific assays for human dimeric inhibins A and B indicate that they are differentially produced during the menstrual cycle and that alterations of inhibin concentrations are inversely associated with changes in follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations in a variety of fertility abnormalities in both men and women (reviewed in Ref. 1Welt C. Sidis Y. Keutmann H. Schneyer A. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 724-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In addition, animal studies have indicated that inhibin may also have autocrine/paracrine activities within the gonads, including influencing steroidogenesis and gametogenesis (11Woodruff T.K. Lyon R.J. Hansen S.E. Rice G.C. Mather J.P. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, disruption of the inhibin α subunit in the mouse, which would be expected to delete both inhibins A and B, results in the appearance of aggressive gonadal tumors that kill most animals before reproductive defects can be fully assessed (12Matzuk M.M. Finegold M.J. Su J.J. Hsueh A.J.W. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 360: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activin A and B levels are severely exaggerated in these mice (13Matzuk M.M. Finegold M.J. Mather J.P. Krummen L. Lu L. Bradley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8817-8821Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that inhibin acts as a tumor suppressor and may also regulate, at least to some degree, activin biosynthesis and release, emphasizing the complex interrelationship between inhibin and activin biosynthesis and action in numerous tissues and physiological systems. Like other TGF-β superfamily members, activins signal via a heteromeric complex of type II and type I receptors. Activin binds directly to one of two identified type II receptors, ActRII or ActRIIB, which recruits one of two type I receptors, ActRIA or ActRIB (also known as Alk2 (activin-like kinase-2) and Alk4, respectively). Following ligand binding, the type I receptors are phosphorylated by the type II receptors to initiate the intracellular signaling cascade (reviewed in Refs. 14Mathews L.S. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 310-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar and 15Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). Although inhibin can bind to activin type II receptors, this binding is at least 10-fold lower compared with activin (16Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) and thus does not appear to be sufficient to account for the endocrine activity of inhibin. This situation was recently clarified when a high affinity inhibin receptor comprising ActRII and the TGF-β type III receptor (TβRIII; betaglycan) was proposed (17Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Presumably, when ActRII is complexed with inhibin and TβRIII, ActRII is inhibited from associating with activin and ActRI, thereby disrupting activin signaling. However, because these studies were conducted in transfected cells, they could not exclude the participation of other as yet uncharacterized cell-surface proteins in this binding complex. Thus, determination of the affinity and specificity for each possible activin- or inhibin-binding complex would benefit from pure soluble receptors that could be analyzed individually or in complexes, thereby clarifying results from cell-based experiments. We have recently shown that a purified fusion protein containing the TβRII extracellular domain (ECD) linked to human Fc is a useful tool to explore receptor complex specificity and ligand binding affinity (18del Re E. Babitt J.L. Pirani A. Schneyer A.L. Lin H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22765-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have now created soluble (s) ActRII and ActRIIB ECD-Fc fusion proteins (sActRII-Fc and sActRIIB-Fc, respectively) and explored their affinity and specificity for activin and inhibin. In addition, purified sTβRIII-Fc fusion protein in combination with sActRII-Fc or sActRIIB-Fc formed high affinity inhibin-binding complexes in solution, confirming earlier cell-based studies. Finally, in contrast to TGF-β receptors, we did not observe any potentiation of activin binding to sActRII-Fc or sActRIIB-Fc by soluble activin type I receptors, consistent with the non-cooperative model proposed from the crystal structure of ActRIIB (19Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P. Wiater E. Kwiatkowski W. Vale W. Choe S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus, our studies using purified soluble receptors demonstrate the specific requirements for high affinity binding of activins and inhibins to different complexes of activin type II and type I and TGF-β type III receptors, without the confounding variables that whole cell systems necessarily confer. Production of Soluble Receptors—The ECDs of ActRII (residues 1–135) (20Donaldson C.J. Mathews L.M. Vale W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 184: 310-316Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and ActRIIB (residues 1–134) (21Hilden K. Tuuri T. Eramaa M. Ritvos O. Blood. 1994; 83: 2163-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame with the Fc tag of a modified Signal pIgplus vector (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as described previously for sTβRII-Fc (18del Re E.

The Fc tail of Signal pIgplus contains a free cysteine so that the resulting proteins are secreted as dimers (see “Results”). The receptor-Fc plasmids were transfected into 293 cells, which were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). All transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stably transfected cells were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% ultra-low IgG fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in 175-cm2 multifloor flasks (TPP, Transadingen). Recombinant receptor-Fc fusion proteins were purified by protein A affinity chromatography. Tissue culture medium (1 liter/batch) was adjusted to pH 8.2 and applied to a HiTrap rProtein A FF column (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) previously equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After protein loading, the column was washed with PBS to remove nonspecifically bound proteins and eluted in 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 3.0). Eluted fractions were immediately neutralized by addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The concentration of eluted protein was determined by bovine serum albumin protein assay (Pierce) and confirmed by amino acid analysis. Protein purity was assessed by 4–12% SDS-PAGE using precast gels (Invitrogen) followed by silver staining (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturers' protocol. Receptor-Fc proteins were also analyzed by Western blotting. Each preparation was separated on 4–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). After transfer, the membrane was washed with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked overnight in 8% dry milk in PBST. The membrane was incubated with goat anti-ActRII, anti-ActRIIB, or anti-TβRIII antibody (R&D Systems) or with anti-human Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Chemiluminescence detection was performed with Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescent reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mouse ActRIA-Fc and ActRIB-Fc proteins were purchased from R&D Systems. Iodination—Human activins A and B (R&D Systems) were iodinated by the lactoperoxidase method and purified by electrophoresis as described previously (5Sidis Y. Tortoriello D.V. Holmes W.E. Pan Y. Keutmann H.T. Schneyer A.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Inhibins A and B (R&D Systems) were iodinated using the reduced chloramine-T method described previously for TGF-β (23Ruff E. Rizzino A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as adapted for inhibin (24Vaughan J.M. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2038-2050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by gel filtration chromatography. Ligand Binding Assays—Soluble recombinant human receptors were diluted in Tris-buffered saline/casein blocking buffer (BioFX, Owings Mills, MD) and incubated overnight on protein A-coated 96-well plates (Pierce) at 4 °C. Plates were then washed with wash buffer (BioFX) and blocked for 2 h at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline/casein blocking buffer. For competition binding assays, fixed amounts of radioligand (50,000–10,0000 cpm) was added to the receptor-coated plates together with increasing amounts (2 pm to 500 nm) of homologous or heterologous nonradioactive ligands as described under “Results” and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with wash buffer, wells were separated and counted in a γ-counter. To allow inhibin receptor proteins to form complexes prior to binding assays, these experiments were performed with soluble binding assays. sActRII-Fc or sActRIIB-Fc with or without (control) sTβRIII-Fc proteins (as indicated in the figures) was diluted in Tris-buffered saline/casein blocking buffer and incubated overnight with a fixed amount of 125I-inhibin A or B (∼ 100,000 cpm) and increasing amounts (2 pm to 500 nm) of unlabeled inhibin at 4 °C. The samples were then plated on protein A-coated plates, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and counted as described above. The same protocol was employed to perform ActRII·ActRI complex binding experiments, except that iodinated activin A or B was used as radioligand. Assessment of Biological Activity—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed in 24-well trays using Effectene (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) and a total of 200 ng of DNA, including 80 ng of the Smad-responsive reporter CAGA-Luc (a gift from Dr. S. Dennler) (25Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar), 20 ng of pRL-TK (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and 100 ng of nonspecific plasmid DNA. Following 16 h of post-transfection incubation, cells were treated with fresh medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.18 nm activin alone or preincubated (60 min) with ActRIIA-Fc, ActRIIB-Fc, or FST288 (follistatin 288; obtained from the National Hormone and Peptide Program, National Institutes of Health) as indicated for an additional 16 h in duplicates. Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp.). Each experiment was repeated three times. To evaluate the effect of the activin type I receptors on the activity of the activin type II receptors, 0.2 μg of commercially purchased ActRIA-Fc or ActRIB-Fc was preincubated with or without equal amounts of each of the type II receptors before addition to the cells as described above. Removal of the Fc Tag—To determine whether the presence of the Fc tag altered biological activity, sActRII-Fc or sActRIIB-Fc (0.5 μg) was incubated with or without 0.1 μg of Factor Xa (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly MA) in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 6 h at 23 °C. Cleavage was verified by resolving 10 ng of the Factor Xa- or mock-treated receptors on a 12% Ready-Gel (Bio-Rad) under reducing conditions, followed by Western blotting as described above. Receptor Deglycosylation—To determine whether the reduced activity of sActRIIB-Fc relative to sActRII-Fc was due to the presence of carbohydrates, sActRIIA-Fc or sActRIIB-Fc (5 μg) was treated with or without 500 units of peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs Inc.) at 37 °C for 1 h. The completion of the deglycosylation reaction was confirmed by resolving 0.1 μg of the treated material on a Ready-Gel as described above and staining with Silver Stain Plus (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's protocol. Data Analysis—Binding data were analyzed by the NIHRIA program (26Rodbard D. Munson P.J. Delean A. Radioimmunoassay and Related Procedures in Medicine. 1. International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna1978: 469-504Google Scholar) for parallelism and relative potency (ED50). For homologous assays, dissociation constants were determined by Scatchard analysis using the LIGAND program (27Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 107: 220-228Crossref Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Each curve was also analyzed by Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), which gave nearly identical results. Data shown in tables and all dissociation constant estimates were derived from the LIGAND analysis, whereas Figs. 2 and 7 were produced by Prism. Results shown in figures are representative experiments, and data in tables represent the means ± S.E. of at least three replicates. Significance of differences in radiolabeled activin binding to mixtures of activin type II and type I receptors was assessed by Student's t test with p < 0.05 used to indicate significance. Results from bioassay experiments are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three replicates.Fig. 7Reconstitution of soluble high affinity inhibin receptors. A, investigation of radiolabeled inhibin A binding to sActRII-Fc, sTβRII (TBR II)-Fc, sTβRIII-Fc, and combinations of these receptors at the doses shown. Whereas 2000 cpm bound to sActRII-Fc alone, only 1000 cpm bound to sTβRIII-Fc alone or to TβRII used as a control (i.e. indicates nonspecific binding). When sActRII-Fc was mixed with increasing amounts of sTβRIII-Fc, substantial increases in inhibin binding were observed at doses above 13 nm. When sTβRII-Fc was substituted for sActRII-Fc, only nonspecific binding was observed, indicating that inhibin binding is specific for activin type II receptors complexed with TβRIII. B, binding competition curves and Scatchard analysis for sActRII-Fc·sTβRIII-Fc complexes showing high affinity binding for this soluble complex similar to affinities reported for the membrane-bound complex (17Lewis K.A.

C, competitive binding curves and Scatchard analysis for sActRIIB-Fc·TβRIII-Fc complexes showing 2-fold higher affinity for this combination than observed for sActRII-Fc·TβRIII-Fc complexes in B. The data shown are representative of three experiments, the means of which are shown in Table III. Inh A, inhibin A; Inh B, inhibin B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Characterization of Soluble Activin Receptors—Recombinant sActRII-Fc and sActRIIB-Fc fusion proteins purified from conditioned medium were analyzed by silver staining of reduced SDS-polyacrylamide gels and found to be >95% pure. sActRII-Fc ran as a single band of ∼55,000 Da, whereas sActRIIB-Fc appeared as a doublet of ∼53,000 and 57,000 Da (Fig. 1A). sTβRIII-Fc was also a single band under reducing conditions with an apparent molecular mass of ∼120,000 Da (Fig. 1B); and consistent with deletion of glycosaminoglycans, none of the typical heterogeneity of molecular mass was observed. To characterize the multimeric nature of these recombinant proteins, they were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-human Fc antibody under reducing (Fig. 1C) and nonreducing (Fig. 1D) conditions. Although the relative molecular mass of each receptor-Fc fusion protein agrees with that obtained from the silver-stained gel when reduced (Fig. 1C), the fusion proteins are clearly dimeric under nonreducing conditions, most likely via disulfide bonding between the Fc chains. Affinity and Specificity of the Soluble Activin Receptor Fusion Proteins—The affinities of sActRII-Fc and sActRIIB-Fc for 125I-activin A or B were determined by Scatchard analysis, with representative experiments shown in Fig. 2 and means of at least three replicates shown in Table I. The affinity of sActRII-Fc for activin A was surprisingly high, averaging 49 pm (Table I) compared with 150–400 pm for the natural membrane-anchored receptor (28Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Fischer W.H. Donaldson C. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28036-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and 2–7 nm for the soluble receptor ECD with no tag (29Donaldson C.J. Vaughan J.M. Corrigan A.Z. Fischer W.H. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1760-1766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, this affinity was >60-fold greater than for activin B (3.2 nm) (Fig. 2 and Table I). In contrast, the affinity of sActRIIB-Fc for activin A (326 pm) was ∼7-fold lower than that of sActRII-Fc (Table I), but closer to that observed for the membrane-bound form of 100–380 pm (30Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 68: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 31Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Receptor. 1993; 3: 173-181PubMed Google Scholar). Like sActRII-Fc, the affinity of sActRIIB-Fc for activin B was lower than for activin A (1.9 nm) but higher than the affinity of sActRII-Fc for activin B (Table I). These results demonstrate that the activin type II receptor-Fc fusion proteins are capable of high affinity binding to activin and are selective for activin A over activin B. Moreover, sActRII-Fc binds activin A at an affinity surpassing that of the intact membrane-anchored form of ActRII.Table IAffinity of sActRII-Fc and sActRIIB-Fc for activin A or BReceptorRadioligandCompetitorKd ± S.E.pmsActRII-FcActivin AActivin A49.3 ± 25sActRII-FcActivin BActivin B3240 ± 224sActRIIB-FcActivin AActivin A326 ± 134sActRIIB-FcActivin BActivin B1900 ± 370 Open table in a new tab The relative potencies of activins A and B compared with inhibins A and B were investigated for sActRII-Fc. When activin A was the radioligand (Fig. 3A and Table II), unlabeled activin A was the most potent competitor (ED50 = 0.73 ± 0.09 ng), whereas the potency of activin B was ∼4-fold lower (ED50 = 3.26 ± 1.29 ng). Inhibins A and B were 20-fold (ED50 = 15.8 ± 0.39 ng) and >30-fold (ED50 = 23.7 ± 2.59 ng) less potent, respectively, than activin A in competing with radiolabeled activin A. When radiolabeled activin B was examined in this system (Fig. 3B and Table II), unlabeled activin A was 8-fold more potent compared with unlabeled activin B (ED50 = 3.75 ± 1.02 ng), indicating that the difference in binding activity between activins A and B for each radioligand was not due to alterations from the iodination process, but was more likely related to aspects of ligand structure that are differentially recognized by sActRII-Fc and sActRIIB-Fc. Consistent with our observations using radiolabeled activin A, inhibins A and B were >20-fold less potent than unlabeled activin A in competing with radiolabeled activin B. These results indicate that sActRII-Fc is selective for activin A, followed by activin B (3–10-fold less) and inhibins A and B (20–30-fold less), similar to what was reported for the membrane-bound form of the receptor (28Harrison C.A.

As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment with 0.18 nm activin A resulted in >30-fold stimulation of reporter activity. This stimulation was inhibited dose-dependently by sActRII-Fc, which was 2-fold more active than the high affinity activin-neutralizing protein FST288. Interestingly, sActRIIB-Fc was ∼5-fold less effective in inhibiting activin A-stimulated reporter activity compared with sActRII-Fc. When the cells were treated with 0.12 nm activin B, the neutralization activity of the soluble receptors was similar to that observed for activin A (Fig. 4B), except that FST288 was less effective in inhibiting activin B compared with activin A as observed previously (32Schneyer A. Schoen A. Quigg A. Sidis Y. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the soluble receptor-Fc fusion proteins are effective inhibitors of activin action in vitro. Moreover, given that both soluble activin receptors were purified to similar degrees (Fig. 1A), the difference in inhibitory potency of sActRII-Fc versus sActRIIB-Fc for activins A and B in this biological assay likely results from the difference in activin binding affinity (Table I). Effect of the Fc Tag and Glycosylation on ActRIIA/B Biological Activity—To determine whether the differences in the affinity and biological potencies of sActRII-Fc and sActRIIB-Fc reflect actual structural differences in the binding domains of the fusion proteins or differential effects of the Fc tag, we examined the effect of removing the tag on biological a"
https://openalex.org/W2081666004,"The intermolecular electron transfer from Achromobacter cycloclastes pseudoazurin (AcPAZ) to wild-type and mutant Alcaligenes xylosoxidans nitrite reductases (AxNIRs) was investigated using steady-state kinetics and electrochemical methods. The affinity and the electron transfer reaction constant (kET) are considerably lower between AcPAZ and AxNIR (Km = 1.34 mm and kET = 0.87 × 105m-1 s-1) than between AcPAZ and its cognate nitrite reductase (AcNIR) (Km = 20 μm and kET = 7.3 × 105m-1 s-1). A negatively charged hydrophobic patch, comprising seven acidic residues around the type 1 copper site in AcNIR, is the site of protein-protein interaction with a positively charged hydrophobic patch on AcPAZ. In AxNIR, four of the negatively charged residues (Glu-112, Glu-133, Glu-195, and Asp-199) are conserved at the corresponding positions of AcNIR, whereas the other three residues are not acidic amino acids but neutral amino acids (Ala-83, Ala-191, and Gly-198). Seven mutant AxNIRs with additional negatively charged residues surrounding the hydrophobic patch of AxNIR (A83D, A191E, G198E, A83D/A191E, A93D/G198E, A191E/G198E, and A83D/A191E/G198E) were prepared to enhance the specificity of the electron transport reaction between AcPAZ and AxNIR. The kET values of these mutants become progressively larger as the number of mutated residues increases. The Km and kET values of A83D/A191E/G198E (Km = 88 μm and kET = 4.1 × 105m-1 s-1) are 15-fold smaller and 4.7-fold larger than those of wild-type AxNIR, respectively. These results suggest that the introduction of negatively charged residues into the docking surface of AxNIR facilitates both the formation of electron transport complex and the electron transfer reaction.

These results suggest that the introduction of negatively charged residues into the docking surface of AxNIR facilitates both the formation of electron transport complex and the electron transfer reaction. Electron transfer is a key reaction in biological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration (1Sigel H. Sigel A.

The specificity of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between proteins is important for electron transport complex formation in intermolecular electron transfer.

The effect of electrostatic interaction between green CuNIR and PAZ was well investigated in a kinetic analysis of the intermolecular electron transfer reaction between mutant proteins (10Kukimoto M.

Biol. 2002; 315: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) of the PAZ-CuNIR complex. The hydrophobic patch centered at the type 1 copper site of AcNIR is surrounded by many negatively charged residues (Asp89, Glu118, Glu139, Glu197, Glu201, Glu204, and Asp205) (Fig. 1A) that electrostatically interact with the positively charged Lys residues surrounding the hydrophobic patch of the type 1 copper site of its cognate, PAZ (Fig. 1B). In the blue AxNIR, four of the negatively charged residues (Glu112, Glu133, Glu195, and Asp199) are conserved at the corresponding positions of AcNIR, whereas the other three residues are not acidic amino acids but neutral amino acids (Ala-83, Ala-191, and Gly-198). Therefore, the electrostatic interaction between AxNIR and AcPAZ would not be very effective in the electron transport complex formation. In this paper we report that the specificity of the electron transfer reaction between AxNIR and AcPAZ is enhanced by the introduction of acidic amino acid residues surrounding the hydrophobic patch around the type 1 copper of AxNIR. We have prepared seven AxNIR mutants (A83D, A191E, G198E, A83D/A191E, A83D/G198E, A191E/G198E, and A83D/A191E/G198E). The electron transport from AcPAZ to altered AxNIRs was investigated using steady-state kinetics and electrochemical methods. We discuss how the electrostatic interaction between acidic and basic amino acid side chains on protein surfaces controls the rate of the intermolecular electron transfer reaction between CuNIR and PAZ. Materials—The plasmid vector pMAL-c2X was purchased from New England Biolabs. A TaqDNA polymerase, restriction endonucleases, and other modifying enzymes were obtained from Takara Bio and TOYOBO. A Taq dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) was used for sequence determination. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Recombinant AcPAZ and the plasmid pMAxNIR for the expression of AxNIR as a fusion protein with the maltose-binding protein were prepared as reported previously (14Kataoka K. Kondo A. Yamaguchi K. Suzuki S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 27Kataoka K. Furusawa H. Takagi K. Yamaguchi K. Suzuki S. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the PCR method. For single mutant AxNIRs, we performed a two-step PCR (27Kataoka K. Furusawa H. Takagi K. Yamaguchi K. Suzuki S. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-88Crossref Google Scholar) using oligonucleotide primers containing the same mutation (underlined), i.e. 5′-TGGTCAACCCGGACACCAACGCC-3′ and 5′-CGTTGGTGTCCGGGTTGACC-3′ (A83D forward and reverse, respectively), 5′-CAAGGACTACGAACGCTGGCCG-3′ and 5′-GGCCAGCGTTTCGTAGTCC-3′ (A191E forward and reverse, respectively), or 5′-CCGAAAGCTATGAAGACACGGTGCAGG-3′ and 5′-GCACCGTGTCTTCATAGCTTTCGGC-3′ (G198E forward and reverse, respectively) with pMAxNIR as a template. The mutated DNA fragments were digested with restriction enzymes (EcoRI and BamHI for A83D and BamHI and HindIII for A191E and G198E) and exchanged with the corresponding fragment of pMAxNIR. For double mutant AxNIRs (A83D/A191E and A83D/G198E), the mutated A83D gene fragment digested with restriction enzymes (EcoRI and BamHI) was ligated into pMAxNIR-A191E and pMAxNIR-G198E vector fragments, respectively. For the A191E/G198E double mutant, we carried out the PCR mutagenesis with G198E forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers and pMAxNIR-A191E as a template. For the triple mutant A83D/A191E/G198E AxNIR, the mutated A191E/G198E gene fragment digested with restriction enzymes (BamHI and HindIII) was ligated into the pMAxNIR-A83D vector fragment. The mutant AxNIR genes (pMAxNIR-A83D, pMAxNIR-A191E, pMAxNIR-G198E, pMAxNIR-A83D/A191E, pMAxNIR-A83D/G198E, pMAxNIR-A191E/G198E, and pMAxNIR-A83D/A191E/G198E) were sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 as recombinant proteins. Wild-type and mutant AxNIRs were purified as described previously (27Kataoka K. Furusawa H. Takagi K. Yamaguchi K. Suzuki S. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Spectral and Electrochemical Measurements—The electronic absorption spectra of wild-type and mutant AxNIRs were measured at room temperature with a Shimadzu UV-2200 spectrometer. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of frozen protein samples were recorded at 77 K with a JEOL JES-FE1X X-band spectrometer. The concentration of copper was determined with a Nippon Jarrel Ash AA-880 Mark-II atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetric analyses were carried out using a Bioanalytical Systems Model CV-50W voltammetric analyzer with a three-electrode system consisting of a silver/silver chloride reference electrode, a gold wire counter electrode, and a bis(4-pyridyl) disulfide modified gold working electrode under an argon atmosphere at 25 °C. The intermolecular electron transfer rate constants between the PAZ and AxNIR mutants were obtained in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7) at 25 °C. Kinetic Analysis—The kinetic analyses of mutant AxNIRs and AcPAZ were carried out as follows. Reduced AcPAZ was prepared by the addition of 1.2 eq of ascorbate as a reducing reagent to the solution of the protein, and then the excess reducing reagent was removed by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration under argon atmosphere in a glove box. The reaction mixture contained 2 mm NaNO2 and 20–1,000 μm reduced AcPAZ in a 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7). The reaction was started by adding appropriate amounts of mutant AxNIR to the reaction mixture, and the increase in absorbance of oxidized AcPAZ at 593 nm was monitored under anaerobic conditions at 25 °C. The molar extinction constant of oxidized AcPAZ (ϵ = 3,700 m-1 cm-1 at 593 nm) was used to calculate kinetic parameters. Spectroscopic Properties of Mutant AxNIRs—Seven mutant AxNIRs (A83D, A191E, G198E, A83D/A191E, A83D/G198E, A191E/G198E, and A83D/A191E/G198E) were prepared as described “Experimental Procedures.” The ratio of type 2 copper to type 1 copper in the mutants was estimated to be 0.60 ∼ 0.72 from the atomic absorption spectra of the holo and type 2 copper-depleted mutants. Visible electronic absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of mutant AxNIRs were almost the same as those of wild-type AxNIR (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2, available in the on-line version of this article). The absorption spectra of wild-type and mutant AxNIRs exhibited one intense band at 593 nm (ϵ = ∼3,800 m-1 cm-1) and two broad bands at 470 and 775 nm. The visible absorption bands were assigned to S(Cys) → Cu(II) charge transfer transitions of the type 1 copper. EPR signals of wild-type and mutant AxNIRs displayed the parameters g// = ∼2.21, A// = ∼6.7 mT, and g⊥ = ∼2.06 for the type 1 copper and g// = ∼2.31 and A// = ∼11.7 mT for the type 2 copper. The spectral data indicate that the coordination structures of the type 1 and 2 copper sites in all the mutants are almost the same as those in the wild-type AxNIR (g// = 2.22, A// = 6.9 mT, and g⊥ = 2.05 for the type 1 copper and g// = 2.32 and A// = 12.8 mT for the type 2 copper) (29Suzuki S. Deligeer Yamaguchi K. Kataoka K. Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. Kohzuma T. Shidara S. Iwasaki H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 265-274Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mutations of Ala-83 to Asp, Ala-191 to Glu, and Gly-198 to Glu in AxNIR had little effect on the coordination structure of the type 1 and 2 copper sites. The positions of Ala-83, Ala-191, and Gly-198 in AxNIR correspond to those of Asp-89, Glu-197, and Glu-204 in AcNIR, which are the negatively charged residues around the hydrophobic patch centered at the type 1 copper (Fig. 1A). Other negatively charged residues (Glu-112, Glu-133, Glu-195, and Asp-199) around the hydrophobic patch in AxNIR are conserved in AcNIR (Glu-118, Glu-139, Glu-201, and Asp-205), and, hence, A83D/A191E/G198E would have a docking surface environment quite similar to that of AcNIR. Kinetic Analysis—We determined the apparent electron transfer kinetic parameters between PAZ and wild-type and mutant AxNIRs using steady-state kinetics. The kcat and Km values are shown in Table I. The Km values of mutant AxNIRs decreased in proportion to the number of mutated residues, indicating the increasing affinity of mutant AxNIRs for PAZ. The single mutants of AxNIR, A83D, A191E, and G198E exhibited 1.3-, 1.4-, and 2.7-fold smaller Km values, respectively, than that of the wild-type AxNIR. The double mutants of AxNIR, A83D/A191E, A83D/A198E, and A191E/G198E showed 4.2-, 5.4-, and 5.6-fold smaller Km values, respectively. Furthermore, the simultaneous replacement of three of these residues (Ala-83, Ala-191, and Gly-198) caused a significant increase in affinity (Km = 88 μm), which is considerably similar to that of AcNIR (Km = 20 μm). These results suggest that the negatively charged altered residues (Asp-83, Glu-191, and Glu-198) and the conserved acidic residues (Glu-112, Glu-133, Glu-195, and Asp-199) form the negatively charged docking surface in A83D/A191E/G198E and are involved in the formation of the electron transport complex, with AcPAZ having the positively charged docking surface.Table IKinetic parameters (Km and kcat) of wild-type and mutant CuNIRs for AcPAZCuNIRsKmk cat10-4ms-1Wild-type AxNIR13.4±0.8172±25A83D10.1±0.6193±31A191E9.6±0.4185±20G198E4.9±0.5167±22A83D/A191E3.2±0.2193±30A83D/G198E2.5±0.2198±33A191E/G198E2.4±0.3165±22A83D/A191E/G198E0.88±0.06157±24AcNIR0.20±0.01163±34 Open table in a new tab Interestingly, the kcat values in Table I are not significantly different within the group of mutations. The findings suggest that the rate-limiting step is not the electron transfer from PAZ to the enzymes but might be the reduction of NO2− by AxNIR in the steady-state assay system. Intermolecular Electron Transfer Reactions between PAZ and CuNIRs—Fig. 2 depicts the scheme for voltammetric experiments in which the following events take place: 1) PAZ is reduced at the electrode surface; 2) the reduced PAZ transfers an electron to CuNIR; and 3) the reduced CuNIR is reoxidized by NO2-. In the reduction of NO2− to NO, the direction of the electron transfer process is electrode → PAZ → CuNIR → NO2−. We have previously evaluated the various rate constants for intermolecular electron transfer (kET) from electron donor proteins to CuNIRs using cyclic voltametry (4Suzuki S. Kataoka K. Yamaguchi K.

Commun. 2003; 303: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The kET from AcPAZ to AcNIR has been evaluated to be 7.3 × 105m-1 s-1 at pH 7 (15Kohzuma T. Takase S. Shidara S. Suzuki S. Chem. Lett. 1993; : 149-152Crossref Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 3 are the cyclic voltammograms of PAZ alone (a), PAZ in the presence of wild-type AxNIR (b), A191E (c), A83D/A191E (d), and A83D/A191E/G198E (e), and AcNIR (f) in the presence of nitrite at pH 7. The voltammetric response is little affected by the addition of nitrite to the solution of PAZ (Fig. 3a), suggesting that there is no direct electron transport from the reduced PAZ to nitrite. Upon the addition of CuNIR to the PAZ solution containing nitrite, however, the shape of the voltammogram changed dramatically, and the sigmoidal cathodic current-potential curve (catalytic current) was enhanced (Fig. 3, b–f). The appearance of the catalytic current indicates the regeneration of oxidized PAZ by the electron transport from reduced PAZ to CuNIR in the diffusion layer. The catalytic current heights reflect the reaction rates, and the steady-state catalytic current (iss) is exressed as shown in Equation 1 (30Nicholson R.S. Shain I. Anal.

This expression predicts a scan rate-independent, steady-state current that is proportional to the PAZ concentration and the square root of the concentration of CuNIR (30Nicholson R.S. Shain I. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 706-723Crossref Scopus (5284) Google Scholar, 31Suzuki S. Nakamura N. Yamaguchi K. Kataoka K. Inoue T. Nishio N. Kai Y. Tobari J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 749-758PubMed Google Scholar). The kET values calculated with Equation 1 are shown in Table II. Wild-type AxNIR can slowly accept one electron from AcPAZ (kET = 0.87 × 105m-1 s-1), suggesting that only four negatively charged residues (Glu-112, Glu-133, Glu-195, and Asp-199) around the hydrophobic patch in AxNIR (Fig. 1A) will interact electrostatically with the Lys ring in PAZ (Fig. 1B). The electron transfer reaction between wild-type AxNIR and AfPAZ has also been reported (13Murphy L.M. Dodd F.E. Yousafzai F.K. Eady R.R. Hasnain S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase can accept electrons from a range of structurally different donors, including pseudoazurin, azurin, cytochrome c551, and cytochrome c550. These results can be construed in terms of the concept of “pseudospecificity” to mean that different combinations and orientations should be possible between redox partner proteins through intrinsically small specific hydrophobic patches and by stabilizing complementary electrostatic interactions rather than through strictly specific protein-protein interactions (32Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Leung Y.C. Chan C. Moir J.W.B. Howlett G. Fergusson S.J. Radford S.E. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 33Impagliazzo A. Ubbink M. J.

Because the affinity of mutant AxNIRs for PAZ is also increased in proportion to the number of mutated residues, the observed electron transfer rates are probably associated with the electron transport complex formation. Although A83D and A191E show slightly larger kET values (0.99 × 105m-1 s-1) than wild-type AxNIR, G198E shows a 2.6-fold larger kET value (Table II) and a 2.7-fold smaller Km value for PAZ (Table I) than the wild-type enzyme. It has been proposed that Glu-204 of AfNIR, corresponding to Gly-198 of AxNIR, interacts with Lys-38 of AfPAZ in the electron transport complex (10Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Ohnuki T. Turley S. Adman E.T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas Glu-204 of AcNIR interacts with Lys-10 and Arg-114 of AcPAZ (12Murphy M.E.P. Turley S. Adman E.T. Canters G.W. Vijgenboom E. Biological Electron Transfer Chains: Genetics, Composition, and Mode of Operation. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 115-128Google Scholar). Although the basic amino acid residue of AcPAZ interacting with the Glu-198 residue of G198E can not be specified, the electrostatic interaction between Glu-198 of AxNIR and a positively charged residue of PAZ enhances the electron transport complex formation and the electron transfer reaction. The double mutant A83D/A191E has a 3-fold larger kET value (2.6 × 105m-1 s-1) than wild-type AxNIR. These findings suggest that Asp-83 and Glu-191 in A83D/A191E interact cooperatively with PAZ. The introduction of other negatively charged residues into AxNIR (A83D/G198E and A191E/G198E) also enhances the electron transport complex formation and the electron transfer reaction. It has been reported that Glu-197 of AfNIR, corresponding to Ala-191 of AxNIR, interacts with Lys-10 of AfPAZ (10Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Ohnuki T. Turley S. Adman E.T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the negatively charged Asp-89 residue of AfNIR and AcNIR, corresponding to Ala-83 of AxNIR, has been reported not to interact with any positively charged residues of AfPAZ and AcPAZ, Asp-89 might cooperatively contribute to the electrostatic interaction with PAZ. Moreover, the simultaneous replacement of all of the three residues (Ala-83, Ala-191, and Gly-198) results in a 4.7-fold increase in the kET value compared with that of wild-type AxNIR. The Km value of the triple mutant is 15.2-fold smaller than that of wild-type AxNIR, which implies that the electrostatic interaction between AxNIR and PAZ is important for the enhancement of specific docking between the redox partners. It should be noted that the kET value between PAZ and A83D/A191E/G198E (4.1 × 105m-1 s-1) is almost the same as that between cytochrome c551 from A. xylosoxidans and AxNIR (4.0 × 105m-1 s-1) (9Deligeer Kataoka K. Yamaguchi K. Suzuki S. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 2000; 73: 1839-1840Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but still smaller than that between PAZ and AcNIR (7.3 × 105m-1 s-1)(15Kohzuma T. Takase S. Shidara S. Suzuki S. Chem. Lett. 1993; : 149-152Crossref Google Scholar). The redox potential of the type 1 copper in AxNIR (+290 mV at pH 6) is similar to that in AcNIR (+270 mV at pH 6), and the intramolecular electron transfer rate constant of AxNIR from the type 1 copper to the type 2 copper (2100 s-1 at pH 6) is the same as that of AcNIR (2100 s-1 at pH 6) (4Suzuki S. Kataoka K. Yamaguchi K. Inoue T. Kai Y. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1999; (245-265): 190-192Google Scholar). The four negatively charged residues, Glu-112, Glu-133, Glu-195, and Asp-199 of AxNIR are conserved in AcNIR (Glu-118, Glu-139, Glu-201, and Asp-205), as shown in Fig. 1A. Therefore, A83D/A191E/G198E has the same negative charge distribution on the surface near the type 1 copper as that of AcNIR. However, six of sixteen amino acid residues that constitute the hydrophobic patch around the type 1 copper of AxNIR are different from those of AcNIR. It has been proposed that the hydrophobic patch in blue copper proteins like plastocyanin is important for the formation of an active electron transport complex, and a high degree of complementarity between the interacting surfaces is required for the fast electron transfer (34Jansson H. Ökvist M. Jacobson F. Ejdebäck M. Hansson Ö. Sjölin L Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1607: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, the smaller kET value of A83D/A191E/G198E, as compared with that of AcNIR, would be due to the different structure of the hydrophobic patch between A83D/A191E/G198E and AcNIR. Although it is difficult to display the exact structure of the electron transport complex between PAZ and A83D/A191E/G198E, it would be very similar to that of the electron transport complex between PAZ and AcNIR. The computer simulation of protein docking between AfNIR and AfPAZ has been reported to be the most favorable, and the next best eight models show similar hydrophobic interactions but with a rotation about the β-barrel axis of PAZ (13Murphy L.M. Dodd F.E. Yousafzai F.K. Eady R.R. Hasnain S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A similar protein docking model can also be proposed for the electron transport complex between PAZ and A83D/A191E/G198E. Conclusions—We have investigated the intermolecular electron transfer from AcPAZ to wild-type and seven mutant AxNIRs (A83D, A191E, G198E, A83D/A191E, A93D/G198E, A191E/G198E, and A83D/A191E/G198E) in comparison with AcNIR using spectroscopic and electrochemical methods. The pseudospecific interaction between AcPAZ and wild-type AxNIR was observed, and the specificity of AxNIR was enhanced by the introduction of negative charges into the protein surface. The three mutated amino acid residues with the four negatively charged residues (Glu-112, Glu-133, Glu-195, and Asp-199) form a “negatively charged ring” surrounding the hydrophobic surface of the type 1 copper site of AxNIR, which interacts electrostatically with the positively charged hydrophobic surface of PAZ. This is the first example of the enhancement of both the electron transport complex formation and electron transfer reaction between PAZ and CuNIR mutated by protein engineering.

https://openalex.org/W2051869814,"The cytochrome bd quinol oxidase is one of two respiratory oxidases in Escherichia coli. It oxidizes dihydroubiquinol or dihydromenaquinol while reducing dioxygen to water. The bd-type oxidases have only been found in prokaryotes and have been implicated in the survival of some bacteria, including pathogens, under conditions of low aeration. With a high affinity for dioxygen, cytochrome bd not only couples respiration to the generation of a proton motive force but also scavenges O2. In the current work, the role of a highly conserved arginine residue is explored by site-directed mutagenesis. Four mutations were made: R391A, R391K, R391M, and R391Q. All of the mutations except R391K result in enzyme lacking ubiquinol oxidase activity. Oxidase activity using the artificial reductant N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine in place of ubiquinol was, however, unimpaired by the mutations, indicating that the catalytic center where O2 is reduced is intact. UV-visible spectra of each of the mutant oxidases show no perturbations to any of the three heme components (heme b558, heme b595, and heme d). However, spectroelectrochemical titrations of the R391A mutant reveal that the midpoint potentials of all of the heme components are substantially lower compared with the wild type enzyme. Since Arg391 is close to Met393, one of the axial ligands to heme b558, it is to be expected that the R391A mutation might destabilize the reduced form of heme b558. The fact that the midpoint potentials of heme d and heme b595 are also significantly lowered in the R391A mutant is consistent with these hemes being physically close together on the periplasmic side of the membrane. The cytochrome bd quinol oxidase is one of two respiratory oxidases in Escherichia coli. It oxidizes dihydroubiquinol or dihydromenaquinol while reducing dioxygen to water. The bd-type oxidases have only been found in prokaryotes and have been implicated in the survival of some bacteria, including pathogens, under conditions of low aeration. With a high affinity for dioxygen, cytochrome bd not only couples respiration to the generation of a proton motive force but also scavenges O2. In the current work, the role of a highly conserved arginine residue is explored by site-directed mutagenesis. Four mutations were made: R391A, R391K, R391M, and R391Q. All of the mutations except R391K result in enzyme lacking ubiquinol oxidase activity. Oxidase activity using the artificial reductant N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine in place of ubiquinol was, however, unimpaired by the mutations, indicating that the catalytic center where O2 is reduced is intact. UV-visible spectra of each of the mutant oxidases show no perturbations to any of the three heme components (heme b558, heme b595, and heme d). However, spectroelectrochemical titrations of the R391A mutant reveal that the midpoint potentials of all of the heme components are substantially lower compared with the wild type enzyme. Since Arg391 is close to Met393, one of the axial ligands to heme b558, it is to be expected that the R391A mutation might destabilize the reduced form of heme b558. The fact that the midpoint potentials of heme d and heme b595 are also significantly lowered in the R391A mutant is consistent with these hemes being physically close together on the periplasmic side of the membrane. The cytochrome bd respiratory oxidase has a very high affinity for O2 (in nm range) and is found in many prokaryotes (1Jünemann S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 107-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 2Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 3Mogi T. Tsubaki M.

Acta. 1999; 1410: 32-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The bd-type oxidases are being increasingly recognized as physiologically significant. Frequently, these respiratory oxidases are induced under conditions of very low aeration, either to generate a proton motive force by reducing O2 to water or by scavenging O2 to protect the cell (5Hill S. Viollet S. Smith A.T. Anthony C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2071-2078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Juty N.S. Moshiri F. Merrick M. Anthony C. Hill S. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2673-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For example, cytochrome bd was recently found in what were previously identified as strict anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis (7Baughn A.D. Malamy M.H. Nature. 2004; 427: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and Desulfovibrio gigas (8Lemos R.S. Gomes C.M. Santana M. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Teixeira M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 40-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which allowed these organisms to grow aerobically with very low concentrations of O2. Mutations in the enzyme have been implicated in reduced virulence in some pathogens (9Way S.S. Sallustio S. Magliozzo R.S. Goldberg M.B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Endley S. McMurray D. Ficht T.A. J. Bacteriology. 2001; 183: 2454-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although cytochrome bd catalyzes the twoelectron oxidation of either ubiquinol or menaquinol and the reduction of O2 to water, cytochrome bd is completely unrelated to the proton-pumping heme/copper superfamily of respiratory oxidases. Indeed, the bd-type oxidases do not pump protons, although they do generate a proton motive force (11Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14003-14008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Koland J.G. Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It appears that quinol oxidation occurs near the periplasmic surface (13Dueweke T.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3401-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Dueweke T.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4273-4277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhang J. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. FEBS Lett. 2004; 561: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) but that the protons used to form water are taken from the bacterial cytoplasm. Hence, the reaction is coupled to transmembrane charge separation and the generation of a membrane potential. The best characterized bd-type oxidase is from E. coli (1Jünemann S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 107-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 2Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a heterodimer with one copy each of two subunits (CydA and CydB). There are three heme prosthetic groups but no copper. Heme b558 is ligated to His186 and Met393 in CydA (see Fig. 1) (16Fang H. Lin R-J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8026-8032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kaysser T.M. Ghaim J.B. Georgiou C. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13491-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and appears to be directly involved in the oxidation of quinol (18Jünemann S. Wrigglesworth J.M. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9323-9331Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Heme b595 and heme d are both high spin hemes that appear to form a binuclear center where O2 is reduced to water (19Hill J.J. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5863-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is known that O2 binds to ferrous heme d and, in the absence of additional reducing equivalents, forms a stable heme d Fe2+-O2 adduct. The axial ligand of heme b595 has been identified as His19 in CydA (20Hirota S. Mogi T. Anraku Y. Gennis R.B. Kitagawa T. Biospectroscopy. 1995; 1: 305-311Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Sun J. Kahlow M.A. Kaysser T.M. Osborne J.P. Hill J.J. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. Gennis R.B. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2403-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), but the nature and location of the axial ligand to heme d are not known. In the current work, the role of Arg391 in the CydA subunit of the Escherichia coli oxidase is investigated. This arginine is very highly conserved and is only two residues away from Met393, one of the axial ligands to heme b558 (Fig. 1). It was expected, therefore, that this residue might play either a structural or functional role related to heme b558 or the putative quinol binding site that is proposed to be adjacent to this heme (1Jünemann S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 107-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 22Jünemann S. Wrigglesworth J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Four site-directed mutants were made: R391K, R391A, R391Q, and R391M. The R391K mutant oxidase is partially active as a quinol oxidase (25% of wild type activity), but the other three uncharged amino acid substitutions all result in eliminating quinol oxidase activity. The optical spectrum of each of the enzymes is normal, indicating that the hemes are properly assembled and there is no major conformational change. All of the mutants are active using an alternative artificial substrate TMPD, 1The abbreviations used are: TMPD, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; NHE, normal hydrogen electrode. 1The abbreviations used are: TMPD, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; NHE, normal hydrogen electrode. which has previously been characterized as utilizing a different site from that of ubiquinol (23Lorence R.M. Carter K. Gennis R.B. Matsushita K. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 11: 5271-5276Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). This indicates that the O2 binding site and catalytic function are not perturbed by the Arg391 mutants. The major effect of the R391A mutation (and presumably the R391Q and R391M substitutions) is to decrease the electrochemical midpoint potential of heme b558, which is sufficient to explain the lack of quinol oxidase activity. The positive charge on Arg391 appears to stabilize the reduced form of heme b558 in the E. coli oxidase by about 210 mV (+80 mV versus –130 mV). Substitution by another amino acid residue, other than lysine, makes it much harder to reduce heme b558 and inactivates the enzyme. Remarkably, the R391A mutant also results in a lower potential for both heme b595 and heme d. If this is due simply to an electrostatic effect, all of the hemes must be physically close to Arg391. A local conformational change due to the R391A mutation cannot be ruled out as the cause of the lower midpoint potentials of hemes b595 and d. However, this is unlikely, since the optical and EPR spectra appear unperturbed, and the TMPD oxidase activity is unimpaired. Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strain GO105 (cyd AB::kan, cyo, recA), which lacks both cytochrome bo3 and cytochrome bd quinol oxidases (17Kaysser T.M. Ghaim J.B. Georgiou C. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13491-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), was used as the host strain for expressing both the wild type and mutant cytochrome bd from a plasmid. To obtain wild type cytochrome bd, plasmid pTK1 (24Zhang J. Hellwig P. Osborne J.P. Huang H. Moënne-Loccoz P. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Bichemistry. 2001; 40: 8548-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was introduced into the strain. Mutants of cytochrome bd were expressed using pTK1 plasmid as well. Phagemid pZG1 was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis. This phagemid, prepared by Dr. Tamma Zuberi, was generated by ligating the cydA gene into phagemid pT7T3 19u using two unique restriction sites HindIII and SalI. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Expression, and Complementation Test of the Mutant Cytochrome bd—Plasmid pZG1 (see above) was used as template. The oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by the University of Illinois Biotechnology Center and purified using oligonucleotide purification cartridges with melting temperature around 80 °C based on the Stratagene formula. The mutagenesis was performed as described (24Zhang J. Hellwig P. Osborne J.P. Huang H. Moënne-Loccoz P. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Bichemistry. 2001; 40: 8548-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Once the mutant sequences were confirmed from DNA sequencing (CBI Inc.), the mutant plasmids were digested by restriction endonuclease SalI and HindIII. The digestions were then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. The bands containing DNA of cydA were cut from the gel, and DNA was extracted using “GenElute minus EtBr” columns (Sigma) and ligated to vector pTK1 that had been pretreated with the same restriction endonucleases. The resulting mutant cydAB operon was again confirmed from DNA sequencing (CBI Inc.). Complementation was tested as described previously (24Zhang J. Hellwig P. Osborne J.P. Huang H. Moënne-Loccoz P. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Bichemistry. 2001; 40: 8548-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cell Growth and Protein Sample Preparation—Large scale cell growth of strains that grow aerobicallly (i.e. expressing wild type or R391K mutant) was carried out in 24 2-liter flasks shaking at 230 rpm 37 °C using an Innova 4330 incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific). Strains expressing the inactive mutants (e.g. R391A) could not be grown aerobically and were, therefore, grown in a 20-liter fermenter anaerobically at the Fermentation Facility at the University of Illinois using LB containing 100 μg/ml Amp, 50 μg/ml Kan, and 0.3% glucose, pH 7, at 37 °C. The mutant cytochrome bd oxidases were purified as described previously (24Zhang J. Hellwig P. Osborne J.P. Huang H. Moënne-Loccoz P. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Bichemistry. 2001; 40: 8548-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The pooled fractions were concentrated using an Amicon concentrator with a 50-kDa molecular weight cut-off filter and then dialyzed three times against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.9, containing 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% N-lauroylsarcosine. Both wild type and mutant cytochrome bd samples were then examined, using the same dialysis buffer for appropriate dilution unless specified otherwise. All of these assays were carried out as described in Ref. 24Zhang J. Hellwig P. Osborne J.P. Huang H. Moënne-Loccoz P. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B. Bichemistry. 2001; 40: 8548-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. UV-visible Spectroscopic Measurements—All of the absorbance spectra in the UV-visible region were obtained with a DW2000 spectrophotometer (Aminco) or UV-2101PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) using a 1-cm path length cuvette. The absorbance spectra for midpoint potential measurements were obtained using an ultrathin layer spectroelectrochemical cell (25Moss D. Nabedryk E. Breton J. Mäntele W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) with the UV-2101PC scanning spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). EPR Spectroscopic Measurements—X-band (9.09-GHz) EPR spectra were acquired on a Varian E-122 spectrometer with a modulation amplitude of 5 gauss at 100 kHz at 9 K. Samples were prepared as frozen glasses in 3-mm inner diameter tubes using an Air Product Helitran cryostat. The magnetic field was calibrated with a Varian NMR gauss meter, and the microwave frequency was determined by an EIP frequency meter (San Jose, CA). Spectra were recorded with ferricyanide-oxidized samples of the R391A mutant oxidase (30 μm) at 9 K and a power of 1 milliwatt. Difference Spectroscopy Showing Binding of CO—The R391A mutant oxidase (2.3 μm) was made anaerobic by purging with argon gas for 1 h and was then reduced by adding fresh dithionite solution. The absorption spectrum of the reduced enzyme was recorded and taken as a base line. The sample was then purged with CO gas flow for 5 min, following which the absorbance spectrum was taken. The difference spectrum was generated by subtracting the spectrum of reduced enzyme from the one after binding CO. Redox Titrations of Wild Type Cytochrome bd and the R391A Mutant—Both wild type and the Arg391 mutant oxidases were prepared as described above. The redox titration was carried out using the ultrathin layer spectroelectrochemical cell for UV-visible spectroscopy as previously described (25Moss D. Nabedryk E. Breton J. Mäntele W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The gold grid working electrode was chemically modified by 2 mm cysteamine solution as reported before (26Hellwig P. Ostermeier C. Michel H. Ludwig B. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In order to accelerate the redox reaction, 15 different mediators were added, as reported in Ref. 26Hellwig P. Ostermeier C. Michel H. Ludwig B. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, to a total concentration of 40 μm each. At this concentration and with the path length below 10 μm, no spectral contribution from the mediators in the visible region could be detected in the control experiment with samples lacking the protein. As a supporting electrolyte, 100 mm KCl was added. Approximately 25–30 μl of the protein sample was used to fill the spectroelectrochemical cell. Absorbance changes were monitored at multiple wavelengths using a UVPC-2101 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The equilibration time was less than 15 min under the conditions described above. Redox titrations were performed by stepwise setting the potentials and recording the spectra after sufficient equilibrations. All measurements were obtained at 10 °C and were repeated at least twice. For the wild type enzyme, absorbance changes at 429, 560, and 628 nm were used to generate the heme titration curves. For the R391A mutant, due to the dilute concentration, absorbance changes at 628 nm were too small to generate an accurate curve. The midpoint potentials (Em) were obtained by interactive fitting to a Nernst equation using the program offered by Origin (Microcal). FTIR Measurements—Purified wild type enzyme (grown anaerobically) and the R391A mutant (20 μm) were concentrated using a microconcentrator (Amicon, 50-kDa cut-off filter) by centrifugation using 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.3, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% N-lauroyl sarcosine. FTIR and visible difference spectra as a function of the applied potential were obtained simultaneously from the same sample with a setup combining an IR beam from the interferometer (modified IFS 25; Bruker, Germany) for the 4000 to 1000 cm–1 range and a dispersive spectrometer for the 400–900-nm range. Electrochemically induced difference spectra were recorded and processed as previously described in Ref. 25Moss D. Nabedryk E. Breton J. Mäntele W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar. In all experiments, the protein solution was first equilibrated at the initial potential of the electrode, and single beam spectra in the IR range were recorded. Then a potential step toward the final potential was applied, and the single beam spectrum of this state was again recorded after equilibration. Subsequently, difference spectra, as presented in this work, were calculated from the two single beam spectra with the initial single beam spectrum taken as the reference. The equilibration at the applied potential generally took less than 5– 6 min in the potential range from –0.3 to 0.7 V. Typically, 5 × 128 scans were co-added, and 10–20 spectra were averaged. No smoothing or deconvolution procedures were applied. The noise level in the difference spectra was estimated to be around 30–50 × 10–6 absorbance units in the spectral range under consideration except for the region of the strongly absorbing water bending and protein amide I modes at ∼1650 cm–1, where the noise was slightly higher. HPLC Analysis of Quinone Content—Membranes from different growth conditions were isolated as previously described (27Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9159-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and small aliquots were homogenized using a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (disodium salt), pH 7.5. Either this membrane suspension or, alternatively, purified protein was prepared to contain 3– 6 nmol of cytochrome bd in 500 μl. Quinone was extracted by vortex-mixing 500 μl of the sample with 3 ml of methanol/petroleum ether (v/v ratio 3:2) and centrifuged to collect the supernatant. The vortex and centrifuge step were repeated three times to ensure complete extraction of quinone. Supernatant containing extracted quinone was dried under nitrogen gas flow and quinone was redissolved in 100 μl of ethanol just prior to HPLC injection. A BIO-CAD Sprint™ (PerSeptive Biosystems) HPLC and Microsorb-MV 100A HPLC column (Varian Analytical Instruments) were used. The running phase was 100% ethanol, and eluted material was monitored at 278 nm. The peak area was calculated, and the amount of quinone bound to the sample was obtained by comparing with the standard peak, in which the amount of UQ-10 added was known. The extraction efficiency was also taken into account to get the real amount of quinone bound to the sample. To obtain the extraction efficiency factor, a known amount of UQ-10 (Sigma) was added both to the protein sample for extraction and directly to an HPLC column. Anaerobic Reduction of the Enzyme by Ubiquinol-1—Enzyme solutions (about 5 μm) were made anaerobic by purging the vapor phase with water-saturated argon gas for 1 h in a homemade anaerobic cuvette with a small stir bar stirring at the bottom. The reaction was initiated by the injection of a mixture of dithiothreitol and ubiquinol-1 to the cuvette to final concentrations of 2 mm and 400 μm, respectively. A series of absorbance spectra were taken starting either before or right after the mixing using a photodiode array detector (from the BioSequential SX-17MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer; Applied Photophysics Ltd.) until no further changes could be observed. Aerobic Reduction of the Enzyme by Menadiol—Enzyme solutions (about 10 μm) were diluted 10-fold with the same dialysis buffer used for purification. The reaction was initiated by injecting a mixture of menadione and dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 330 μm and 13.5 mm, respectively. A series of absorbance spectra were taken right before the mixing using an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) with a cycling time of 0.5 s until no further changes could be observed. CO Photolysis of the CO Adduct of Fully Reduced Enzyme—The purified wild type and R391A oxidases (about 5 μm) were reduced by incubation with 100% carbon monoxide gas and dithionite solution. A gas mixture consisting of 1% CO and 99% argon was introduced to the gas-tight cuvette, which held the reduced sample until the 100% CO gas was fully replaced. A flash with a duration of several ms was obtained with a camera flash unit, followed immediately by recording of the UV-visible spectral changes of the sample using the photodiode array detector of the BioSequential SX-17MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics) until no further changes were observed. Data were analyzed using the Matlab 6.1 program with 3.3 nm/point. The global multiexponential fittings for spectral changes between 300 and 800 nm were generated by the SplMod program (28Provencher S.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 27-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) with the equation A (t, λ) = C0 (λ) + C1 (λ)e–k1t + C2 (λ)e–k2t + C3 (λ)e–k3t..., assuming a one-, two-, or three-phase process each time. Oxidation of the Reduced Enzyme with O2—The purified R391A protein sample (about 5 μm) was made anaerobic by purging with argon gas for 1 h in a gas-tight cuvette and was then was reduced by an equivalent amount of freshly made dithionite dissolved in the same buffer as used for the enzyme. Oxygen gas was introduced to the cuvette for 18 s once the sample was fully reduced. A series of spectra was taken during the reduction and oxidation using the photodiode array detector of the stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics Ltd.). Catalytic Activity, UV-visible, and EPR Spectroscopy—The R391A, R391Q, and R391M mutant oxidases were unable to sustain aerobic growth when expressed in a strain (GO105) lacking the wild type respiratory oxidases, and the purified oxidases had no ubiquinol oxidase activity (see Table I). In contrast, the R391K mutant oxidase was able to support aerobic growth on plates as the only respiratory oxidase, and the purified enzyme exhibited 25% of the quinol oxidase activity compared with the wild type cytochrome bd (Table I). In liquid culture, the aerobic growth of cells relying on the R391K mutant oxidase (i.e. expressed in the cyo–, cyd– strain) was very poor. Although lysine could partially substitute for arginine at this position in the structure, it is clear that simply having a positive charged residue at position 391 is not sufficient for robust growth.Table ICharacteristics of the Arg391 mutants of subunit I of E. coli cytochrome bdSample nameComplementation testUQH2-1 oxidase activityTMPD oxidase activityHeme b/d ratio%%Wild typeYes1001002-2.5R391ANo<0.11702.85R391KYes251402.15R391MNo<0.51003.16R391QNo<0.11002.15 Open table in a new tab Interestingly, the steady state oxidase activity using TMPD as the electron donor in place of ubiquinol was virtually unaffected by the mutations. It has been previously shown that TMPD donates electrons to the oxidase from a site distinct from that used by ubiquinol (23Lorence R.M. Carter K. Gennis R.B. Matsushita K. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 11: 5271-5276Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The fact that TMPD oxidase activity is not impaired by the mutations demonstrates that the active site for the reduction of O2 (i.e. heme b595/heme d binuclear center) is fully functional in these mutants. The heme analysis and the UV-visible reduced minus oxidized difference spectra of each of the purified mutant oxidases indicate no substantial differences compared with the wild type enzyme (Table I and Fig. 2). The R391A mutant was selected as representative of the set of mutants and subjected to more detailed examination. The EPR spectrum of the fully oxidized R391A mutant oxidase was found to be essentially identical to the spectrum of the wild type oxidase (not shown). This similarity includes the unusual highly asymmetric low spin spectral feature near g = 3.5 arising from the low spin heme b558 component of the oxidase (29Spinner F. Cheesman M.R. Thomson A.J. Kaysser T. Gennis R.B. Peng Q. Peterson J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These studies show that the mutations do not perturb the assembly of the enzyme or result in a gross conformational change of the enzyme and do not perturb the local structure around any of the three heme prosthetic groups to the extent that the EPR or UV-visible spectra are altered. CO Binding to Heme d—Another useful probe of perturbations caused by the Arg391 mutants is the binding of CO to the oxidase. CO binds to the ferrous heme d component of the enzyme. Spectroscopic changes to the hemes were monitored upon titrating CO into a solution of the dithionite-reduced R391A and wild type oxidases. The changes induced by CO binding are identical for the two enzymes (not shown). In addition, CO was photodissociated from the enzyme, and the recombination kinetics was examined. In each case, the recombination kinetics (not shown) are biphasic, with rates of 266 s–1 (k1) and 15.5 s–1 (k2) for the wild type cytochrome bd and 133 s–1 (k1) and 6 s–1 (k2) for the R391A mutant. It is concluded that there is no substantial perturbation by the R391A mutant, confirming that the active site for O2 binding (heme b595/heme d binuclear center) is essentially unchanged by the mutation. FTIR Oxidized Minus Reduced Difference Spectroscopy—The oxidized minus reduced (–0.3 to +0.7 V) FTIR difference spectrum (1800 to 1200 cm–1) of the wild type, R391K, and R391A mutant oxidases were recorded and compared. Fig. 3 compares the difference spectra of the wild type and R391A oxidases. The amplitudes have been normalized based on spectra measured in the visible spectral range. The spectra of both mutants are very similar to that of the wild type enzyme, consistent with the conclusion that the mutations do not result in any large conformational changes. The bands previously assigned (30Zhang J. Oettmeier R. Gennis R.B. Hellwig P. Bichemistry. 2002; 41: 4612-4617Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to menaquinone (1264 cm–1) and ubiquinone (1295 cm–1) are both present in the spectra of the mutants (arrows in Fig. 3). Small variations indicate differences in quinone ratio in accordance with Ref. 30Zhang J. Oettmeier R. Gennis R.B. Hellwig P. Bichemistry. 2002; 41: 4612-4617Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar. The quinones were extracted from the isolated wild type and R391A oxidases and analyzed by HPLC chromatography. The results were consistent with the FTIR spectroscopy and indicated that both ubiquinone and menaquinone co-purify with the enzymes (data not shown). Potentiometric Titrations of the Wild Type and R391A Oxidases—The electrochemical properties of the oxidase are greatly perturbed by the R391A mutation. This can be seen in Fig. 4, which shows the UV-visible difference spectra for the enzymes at different redox cuts at pH 8.3. For the wild type oxidase (Fig. 4A), the enzyme is fully reduced at –342 mV (NHE) and at 0 mV (NHE). The enzyme is fully oxidized at +558 mV (NHE), as shown by the difference spectrum. The R391A mutant behaves very diffe"
https://openalex.org/W2098004876,"In the haloarchaea <i>Haloferax volcanii</i>, ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm and membrane-bound at similar levels. Transformation of <i>H. volcanii</i> to express chimeras of the translocon components SecY and SecE fused to a cellulose-binding domain substantially decreased ribosomal membrane binding, relative to non-transformed cells, likely due to steric hindrance by the cellulose-binding domain. Treatment of cells with the polypeptide synthesis terminator puromycin, with or without low salt washes previously shown to prevent <i>in vitro</i> ribosomal membrane binding in halophilic archaea, did not lead to release of translocon-bound ribosomes, indicating that ribosome release is not directly related to the translation status of a given ribosome. Release was, however, achieved during cell starvation or stationary growth, pointing at a regulated manner of ribosomal release in <i>H. volcanii</i>. Decreased ribosomal binding selectively affected membrane protein levels, suggesting that membrane insertion occurs co-translationally in Archaea. In the presence of chimera-incorporating sterically hindered translocons, the reduced ability of ribosomes to bind in the transformed cells modulated protein synthesis rates over time, suggesting that these cells manage to compensate for the reduction in ribosome binding. Possible strategies for this compensation, such as a shift to a post-translational mode of membrane protein insertion or maintained ribosomal membrane-binding, are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1998108337,"The integrin αvβ3 has been shown to exist in low and high affinity conformations. Activation to the high affinity state is thought to depend on the “switchblade-like” opening, from a low affinity bent conformation with a closed headpiece to an extended form of the integrin with an open headpiece. Activation has been shown to depend on separation of the cytoplasmic domains. How cytoplasmic domain separation is related to separation of the transmembrane domains is unknown, and the distance of separation of the transmembrane domains required for activation has not been defined. A constrained secreted form of αvβ3 was engineered that introduced a 50-Å separation of the integrin C-terminal tails of the extracellular domains of the αv and β3 subunits. Receptor binding and recognition by ligand-induced binding state (LIBS) monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that the mutant receptor was locked into a low affinity state that was likely in a partially extended conformation but with a closed headpiece. In the presence of RGD peptide, the constrained receptor was able to fully extend, as determined by full exposure of LIBS epitopes. In the presence of the appropriate LIBS antibody, high affinity ligand binding of the constrained receptor was achieved. The results support the existence of transient intermediate activation states of secreted αvβ3. Furthermore, these results with the secreted αvβ3 receptor support a model for the full-length membrane-bound form of αvβ3, whereby a 50-Å lateral separation of the integrin αv and β3 transmembrane domains would be sufficient to enforce the switchblade-like opening to the extended conformation but insufficient for full receptor activation.

A low affinity state is maintained by a “highly bent” conformation with the integrin headpiece, which contains the ligand binding site, oriented toward the cell membrane. An extensive interface between the headpiece and the legs is observed in the x-ray structure of αvβ3, which reveals a bent conformation assumed to correspond to this low affinity state (3Xiong J.P.

Presumably, inside-out signaling proceeds by separation of the α and β legs, which leads to structural rearrangements in the integrin headpiece (i.e. priming). Conversely, ligand binding would lead to structural rearrangements of the headpiece that would then lead to conformational alteration of the α and β legs (i.e. activation). However, the role of separation of the α and β legs and the sequence of conformational events leading to integrin receptor priming and activation remain to be elucidated.In this report, we have used crystallographic data of integrin αvβ3 and placental alkaline phosphatase to design an integrin fusion protein that directly tests the role of a defined spatial separation (50-Å) of the integrin α and β legs in mediating long range global changes in conformation of the αvβ3 integrin. We have shown that this 50-Å separation is sufficient to expose β3 tail domain activation epitopes but insufficient to induce high affinity ligand binding. We demonstrated that full activation of the secreted receptor requires further conformational changes, most likely localized in the integrin headpiece. These data with a secreted form of αvβ3 provide a model of receptor activation for membrane-bound αvβ3, whereby separation of the α and β tail domains exposes the headpiece-tailpiece interface leading to an extended conformer priming the receptor for ligand engagement.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstructs, Antibodies, and Reagents–The αv extracellular domain alkaline phosphatase (αv-AP) 1The abbreviations used are: AP, alkaline phosphatase; LIBS, ligand-induced binding state; tr, truncated; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; M-, monomeric; D-, dimeric. fusion was constructed from αv-pCDM8 (14Weinacker A.

Alkaline phosphatase activity was quantified by luminometry using Phosphalight™ (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Receptor samples were normalized by diluting as appropriate in TBS. Equal amounts and concentrations of receptors were added in the presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+ and 0.5 mm Mg2+ (TBS-CaMg) with or without LIBS-1, -2, or -6 (10 μg/μl), 1.0 mm Mn2+ (TBS-Mn), or GRGDNP (50 μg/ml; BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA) to individual wells of 96-well plates precoated with 10 μg/μl vitronectin, fibronectin, collagen I, fibrinogen (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), LIBS-1, -2, or -6, mouse anti-αv (8B8), or mouse anti-alkaline phosphatase. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) (A3803, Sigma). After incubation for 3 h at 23 °C, individual wells of the plates were washed extensively with TBS-CaMg or TBS-Mn, depending on the assay, and then treated with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). Bound receptor was determined by absorbance (A405) of the test sample minus absorbance (A405) of a duplicate well coated only with bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml). All assays were performed at least in triplicate.Statistical Analysis–Analysis of variance (for parametric data) or the Kruskal-Wallis test (for non-parametric data) was used for more than 2 data sets. Tukey's or Dunn's test was used for parametric or non-parametric data, respectively, to determine where the differences lay. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. Data are shown as means ± 1 S.E., unless otherwise noted.

We fused the C termini of the integrin αv (αv-AP) and β3 (β3-AP) subunits to the N terminus of the mature secreted form of human placental alkaline phosphatase to create a C-terminally constrained integrin (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the crystal structure of human placental alkaline phosphatase (Protein Data Bank code 1EW2) reveals a homodimeric molecule where the N termini are separated 50 Å by an interfacial wedge-shaped crown domain composed of 60 residues from each monomer (20Le Du M.H. Stigbrand T. Taussig M.J. Menez A. Stura E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9158-9165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The extreme N termini embrace the opposite monomer and are thus likely involved in dimerization and are also likely involved in enzymatic activity, because they are in direct contact with residues involved in allostery (20Le Du M.H. Stigbrand T. Taussig M.J. Menez A. Stura E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9158-9165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the αvβ3-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein, the N termini of placental alkaline phosphatase would be expected to rigidly constrain the C termini of the integrin subunits in a fixed 50-Å separation. Furthermore, the wedge-shaped crown domain of placental alkaline phosphatase would intercalate between the αv and β3 subunit legs, further encouraging the separation of the α and β legs (Fig. 1C). Co-transfection of the β3 subunit-placental alkaline phosphatase fusion construct with the truncated αv construct without a placental alkaline phosphatase fusion (αv-tr) was predicted to result in a dimer of heterodimers of αvβ3 (D-αvβ3) integrins (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, co-transfection of the αv (αv-AP) and β3 (β3-AP) constructs with placental alkaline phosphatase fused to both C termini was predicted to result in a simple heterodimer of the αvβ3 (hereafter referred to as “monomeric” or M-αvβ3) integrin (Fig. 1, B and C). Indeed, no evidence of αv or β3 subunit homodimer formation was found, because only 293 cells transiently co-transfected with αv-AP and β3-AP or αv-tr and β3-AP led to significant increases in secreted alkaline phosphatase activity, and 293 cells transfected with the αv-AP or β3-AP constructs alone failed to produce any detectable alkaline phosphatase activity in the cell supernatant (data not shown). Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of supernatant from 293 cells stably co-transfected with αv-tr and β3-AP or αv-AP and β3-AP constructs revealed two bands co-migrating at ∼140 and ∼150 kDa or migrating at 200 and 150 kDa, corresponding to the predicted migrations of αv-tr and β3-AP or αv-AP and β3-AP subunits, respectively (Fig. 1D). Heterodimer formation was confirmed because the same two bands could be immunoprecipitated by anti-αv, anti-β3, or anti-alkaline phosphatase antibodies (Fig. 1D). The identity of the bands was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-alkaline phosphatase antibodies, which revealed a single band migrating at 150 kDa and two bands migrating at 150 and 200 kDa from supernatants from 293 cells transfected with αv-tr and β3-AP or αv-AP and β3-AP, respectively (Fig. 1D). D- and M-αvβ3 were assessed by analytical gel filtration to determine the extent of receptor aggregation and to determine whether the position of the elution peaks was consistent with the proposed assembly of D- and M-αvβ3. Both receptors eluted in single major peaks, with M-αvβ3 eluting in a sharp peak from 11 to 12.5 ml and d-αvβ3 eluting in a broader peak from 8.5 to 11.5 ml (Fig. 1E). The peak elution fractions corresponded to molecular masses of 1488 and 663 kDa for D- and M-αvβ3, respectively, when compared with the molecular mass markers of globular protein standards (Fig. 1E, inset). The discrepancies in molecular mass as estimated by gel filtration from molecular mass as estimated by SDS-PAGE (550 kDa for D-αvβ3 and 340 kDa for M-αvβ3) are consistent with a dramatic increase in axial asymmetry as would be expected both for a fusion protein and also for secreted αvβ3 in an extended conformation (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). There was no evidence of massive aggregate formation because no significant amount of either receptor could be found in the void volume. However, a minor peak at 10 ml was found with M-αvβ3, which may correspond to a small amount of multimeric M-αvβ3 (Fig. 1E). This miniscule amount of multimeric M-αvβ3 was unlikely to confound functional studies, because the vitronectin binding activity of M-αvβ3 closely corresponded to the position of the major elution peak, and minimal vitronectin binding activity was detected in the 10-ml fraction (Fig. 1F). The presence of the β3-AP subunit in the peak elution fractions of D-αvβ3 and of both the αv-AP and β3-AP subunits in peak elution fractions of M-αvβ3 was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1F, inset). For the integrin-alkaline phosphatase fusions, it appears that the integrin α and β subunit association determines pairing rather than alkaline phosphatase monomer association. Therefore, the dimeric and monomeric integrin-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins are expressed and secreted and pair to form proper integrin heterodimers, which are correctly folded with respect to antibody epitopes and functional activity.Monomeric αvβ3 Integrin-Alkaline Phosphatase Fusion Protein Is in a Low Affinity State and Is Fully Active in the Presence of Mn2+–The effect of a 50-Å separation of the extracellular domain C termini of αvβ3 on receptor function was tested in solid phase ligand binding assays. Constrained monomeric αvβ3 was inactive in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, because it did not bind to its physiological ligands, vitronectin (VN), fibronectin (FN), and fibrinogen (Fb) (Fig. 2, A-C). However, monomeric αvβ3 (M-αvβ3) bound as well as dimeric αvβ3 (D-αvβ3) to VN, FN, and Fb in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 2, A-C). In the presence of Mn2+, both monomeric and dimeric αvβ3 bound well to VN and less well to FN and Fb, consistent with known αvβ3 ligand binding preferences (21Mehta R.J. Diefenbach B. Brown A. Cullen E. Jonczyk A. Gussow D. Luckenbach G.A. Goodman S.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A-C). This binding was specific, because no binding to an irrelevant ligand (Col I) was seen (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, no binding of control receptors, dimeric αvβ8 (D-αvβ8) and monomeric αvβ8 (M-αvβ8), was seen to VN, FN, Fb, or Col I (Fig. 2), consistent with known solid phase binding preferences of αvβ8 (15Mu D. Cambier S. Fjellbirkeland L. Baron J.L. Munger J.S. Kawakatsu H. Sheppard D. Broaddus V.C. Nishimura S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The dimeric form of αvβ3 was likely in a fully active state, because Mn2+ did not increase binding to VN, FN, or Fb (Fig. 2, A-C). Thus, Mn2+ induced a fully active state of monomeric spatially constrained αvβ3, because it bound to its ligands as well as the dimeric form of αvβ3 (Fig. 2, A-C). Therefore, a 50-Å separation of the C termini of the integrin αv and β3 extracellular domains does not constrain the receptor in a default-active conformation, nor does it constrain the receptor in a low affinity state, because Mn2+ can fully activate it.Fig. 2Monomeric αvβ3 integrin-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein is in a low affinity state and is fully active in the presence of Mn2+. A-D, solid phase receptor binding assays were prepared using immobilized physiologic ligands for αvβ3. As a control, dimeric and monomeric forms of αvβ8 were used that do not bind these same ligands in solid phase assays (15Mu D. Cambier S. Fjellbirkeland L. Baron J.L. Munger J.S. Kawakatsu H.

The binding of equal amounts of monomeric αvβ3 (M-αvβ3), dimeric αvβ3 (d-αvβ3), monomeric αvβ8 (M-αvβ8), or dimeric αvβ8 (D-αvβ8) to each ligand in the presence of Mg2+ (0.5 mm) and Ca2+ (0.5 mm) or Mn2+ (1 mm) was measured using alkaline phosphatase activity (A405).

Monoclonal antibodies, which only recognize integrins in a ligand-bound conformation, are designated as LIBS antibodies (18Frelinger A.L. II I Cohen I. Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Roberts J. Lam S.C.

We used LIBS antibodies directed against the β3 integrin subunit tail domain to investigate the structure of monomeric spatially constrained and dimeric αvβ3-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins. We found that monomeric and dimeric αvβ3 both bound well to LIBS-2 (anti-β3; residues 602-690 (22Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R. Ruggeri Z. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol.

The monomeric receptor bound almost as well as the dimeric receptor to LIBS-2, whereas both receptors bound equally to LIBS-6 (Fig. 3, A and B). Binding of monomeric and dimeric receptors were unchanged in the presence of RGD, indicating that LIBS epitopes were maximally exposed (Fig. 3, A and B).Fig. 3A 50-Å constraint of the C termini of the extracellular domains of monomeric αvβ3 exposes LIBS epitopes of the β3 tail domain but does not fully expose a LIBS epitope spanning the β3 head and tail domains.

Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10215-10221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) in the absence of RGD (Fig. 3C). However, binding of monomeric αvβ3 to LIBS-1 increased, in the presence of RGD, to similar levels as dimeric αvβ3 (Fig. 3C). The binding to LIBS was specific, as no binding to a monomeric αvβ8-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein was seen (Fig. 3, A-C). Furthermore, the increased binding of monomeric αvβ3 to LIBS-1 in the presence of RGD was likely to be significant because no such increases were seen using a non-LIBS anti-αv antibody, 8b8 (Fig. 3D) or an anti-alkaline phosphatase antibody (Fig. 3E).In solid phase binding assays, in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, LIBS-1 (but not LIBS-2 or -6) could increase monomeric αvβ3 binding to VN to similar levels as dimeric αvβ3. Dimeric αvβ3 binding to VN was not affected by the addition of LIBS-1, -2, or -6 (Fig. 3F).DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have created novel spatially constrained secreted integrin αvβ3 heterodimers and have provided evidence that a 50-Å separation of the C-terminal tails of the α and β extracellular domains is sufficient to cause the “bent” inactive conformation of αvβ3 to “extend” to an intermediate activation state.The extracellular domains of αv and β3, when fused to the N termini of placental alkaline phosphatase (a homodimeric, stable, easily quantifiable, and sensitive reporter)"

https://openalex.org/W2038159128,"Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)/TR6/M68 is a soluble receptor that binds to the Fas ligand LIGHT and TL1A. Elevated levels of DcR3 expression have been found in many tumors. We report an unexpected effect of DcR3 by sensitizing Jurkat and U937 cells to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Cell death triggered by anti-Fas and tumor necrosis factor was unaffected by DcR3. DcR3 by itself did not stimulate apoptosis. The ability to augment TRAIL-initiated cell death was not observed with soluble lymphotoxin β receptor or soluble death receptor 3, indicating that binding to LIGHT or TL1A alone is insufficient to trigger TRAIL sensitivity. Incubation with DcR3 did not increase the surface expression of TRAIL receptor, and the level of Fas-associated death domain protein and cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein was not altered. Instead, in the presence of DcR3, TRAIL engagement resulted in an increased activation of caspase-8, an elevated cleavage of Bid, and enhanced release of Smac and cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol compared with TRAIL alone. This led to increased activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. The unusual ability of DcR3 to promote TRAIL-triggered death may be used to potentiate TRAIL efficacy during treatment tumors overexpressing DcR3."
