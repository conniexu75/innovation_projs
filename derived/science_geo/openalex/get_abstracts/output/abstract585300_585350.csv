https://openalex.org/W2607506319,"Class B G-protein-coupled receptors are major targets for the treatment of chronic diseases, such as osteoporosis, diabetes and obesity. Here we report the structure of a full-length class B receptor, the calcitonin receptor, in complex with peptide ligand and heterotrimeric Gαsβγ protein determined by Volta phase-plate single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The peptide agonist engages the receptor by binding to an extended hydrophobic pocket facilitated by the large outward movement of the extracellular ends of transmembrane helices 6 and 7. This conformation is accompanied by a 60° kink in helix 6 and a large outward movement of the intracellular end of this helix, opening the bundle to accommodate interactions with the α5-helix of Gαs. Also observed is an extended intracellular helix 8 that contributes to both receptor stability and functional G-protein coupling via an interaction with the Gβ subunit. This structure provides a new framework for understanding G-protein-coupled receptor function. Volta phase-plate cryo-electron microscopy reveals the structure of the full-length calcitonin receptor in complex with its peptide ligand and Gαsβγ. The use of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in structural biology has exploded in recent years as it provides structural information at near atomic resolution without the need for crystallization. However, cryo-EM has typically been limited to proteins larger than 200 kDa because of issues with low contrast. Patrick Sexton and colleagues report the structure of the full-length calcitonin receptor in complex with its peptide ligand and Gαsβγ protein by Volta phase-plate single-particle cryo-EM. This is the first G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structure to be solved at high resolution by cryo-EM, the first full-length class B GPCR reported and only the second in complex with the full heterotrimeric G protein. The structure shows the GPCR in the active state and reveals key information about the conformational changes associated with peptide agonist binding and G-protein coupling in class B receptors."

Although the specifics of what constitutes a better life vary from generation to generation, one constant is that children expect to do better—or at least to have a good chance at doing better—than their parents. Chetty et al. show that this dream did come true for children born in the middle of the 20th century, but only for half of children born in 1984 (see the Policy Forum by Katz and Krueger). A more even distribution of economic growth, rather than more growth, would allow more children to fulfill their dreams. Science , this issue p. 398 ; see also p. 382"
https://openalex.org/W2607541615,"In recent years, various studies have been conducted on the prediction of crime occurrences. This predictive capability is intended to assist in crime prevention by facilitating effective implementation of police patrols. Previous studies have used data from multiple domains such as demographics, economics, and education. Their prediction models treat data from different domains equally. These methods have problems in crime occurrence prediction, such as difficulty in discovering highly nonlinear relationships, redundancies, and dependencies between multiple datasets. In order to enhance crime prediction models, we consider environmental context information, such as broken windows theory and crime prevention through environmental design. In this paper, we propose a feature-level data fusion method with environmental context based on a deep neural network (DNN). Our dataset consists of data collected from various online databases of crime statistics, demographic and meteorological data, and images in Chicago, Illinois. Prior to generating training data, we select crime-related data by conducting statistical analyses. Finally, we train our DNN, which consists of the following four kinds of layers: spatial, temporal, environmental context, and joint feature representation layers. Coupled with crucial data extracted from various domains, our fusion DNN is a product of an efficient decision-making process that statistically analyzes data redundancy. Experimental performance results show that our DNN model is more accurate in predicting crime occurrence than other prediction models."
https://openalex.org/W2609087776,"Background Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established clinical therapy and computational models have played an important role in advancing the technology. Patient-specific DBS models are now common tools in both academic and industrial research, as well as clinical software systems. However, the exact methodology for creating patient-specific DBS models can vary substantially and important technical details are often missing from published reports. Objective Provide a detailed description of the assembly workflow and parameterization of a patient-specific DBS pathway-activation model (PAM) and predict the response of the hyperdirect pathway to clinical stimulation. Methods Integration of multiple software tools (e.g. COMSOL, MATLAB, FSL, NEURON, Python) enables the creation and visualization of a DBS PAM. An example DBS PAM was developed using 7T magnetic resonance imaging data from a single unilaterally implanted patient with Parkinson’s disease (PD). This detailed description implements our best computational practices and most elaborate parameterization steps, as defined from over a decade of technical evolution. Results Pathway recruitment curves and strength-duration relationships highlight the non-linear response of axons to changes in the DBS parameter settings. Conclusion Parameterization of patient-specific DBS models can be highly detailed and constrained, thereby providing confidence in the simulation predictions, but at the expense of time demanding technical implementation steps. DBS PAMs represent new tools for investigating possible correlations between brain pathway activation patterns and clinical symptom modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2605316699,"Purpose The aim of this study is to explore differences between male and female patients entering a rehabilitation program at a pain clinic in order to gain a greater understanding of different approaches to be used in rehabilitation. Method 1371 patients referred to a specialty pain rehabilitation clinic, completed sociodemographic and pain related questionnaires. They rated their pain acceptance (CPAQ-8), their kinesiophobia (TSK), the impact of pain in their life (MPI), anxiety and depression levels (HAD) and quality of life scales: the SF-36, LiSat-11, and the EQ-5D. Because of the large sample size of the study, the significance level was set at the p ≤.01. Results Analysis by t-test showed that when both sexes experience the same pain severity, women report significantly higher activity level, pain acceptance and social support while men report higher kinesiophobia, mood disturbances and lower activity level. Conclusion Pain acceptance (CPAQ-8) and kinesiophobia (TSK) showed the clearest differences between men and women. Pain acceptance and kinesiophobia are behaviorally defined and have the potential to be changed."
https://openalex.org/W2607556181,"Pericytes regulate key neurovascular functions of the brain. Studies in pericyte-deficient transgenic mice with aberrant signaling between endothelial-derived platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) in pericytes have contributed to better understanding of the role of pericytes in the brain. Here, we studied PdgfrβF7/F7 mice, which carry seven point mutations that disrupt PDGFRβ signaling causing loss of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the developing brain. We asked whether these mice have a stable or progressive vascular phenotype after birth, and whether both pericyte and VSMCs populations are affected in the adult brain. We found an early and progressive region-dependent loss of brain pericytes, microvascular reductions and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, which were more pronounced in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum than in the thalamus, whereas VSMCs population remained unaffected at the time when pericyte loss was already established. For example, compared to age-matched controls, PdgfrβF7/F7 mice between 4-6 and 36-48 weeks of age developed a region-dependent loss in pericyte coverage (22-46, 24-44 and 4-31%) and cell numbers (36-49, 34-64 and 11-36%), reduction in capillary length (20-39, 13-46 and 1-30%), and an increase in extravascular fibrinogen-derived deposits (3.4-5.2, 2.8-4.1 and 0-3.6-fold) demonstrating BBB breakdown in the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, respectively. Capillary reductions and BBB breakdown correlated with loss of pericyte coverage. Our data suggest that PdgfrβF7/F7 mice develop an aggressive and rapid vascular phenotype without appreciable early involvement of VSMCs, therefore providing a valuable model to study regional effects of pericyte loss on brain vascular and neuronal functions. This model could be a useful tool for future studies directed at understanding the role of pericytes in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders associated with pericyte loss such as vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke and human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurocognitive disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2609721436,"Intestinal barrier dysfunction plays an important role in acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis was involved in intestinal barrier failure. Paneth cells protect intestinal barrier and are associated with intestinal microbiota. Here, we investigated changes in intestinal microbiota and antimicrobial peptides of Paneth cells in ileum during ANP.Rats with ANP were established by retrograde injection of 3.5% sodium taurocholate into biliopancreatic duct and sacrificed at 24h and 48h, respectively. Injuries of pancreas and distal ileum were evaluated by histopathological score. Intestinal barrier function was assessed by plasma diamine oxidase activity (DAO) and D-lactate. Systemic and intestinal inflammation was evaluated by TNFα, IL-1β and IL-17A concentration by ELISA, respectively. 16S rRNA high throughput sequencing on fecal samples was used to investigate the changes in intestinal microbiota in the ANP group at 48h. Lysozyme and α-defensin5 were measured by real-time PCR, western blot and immunofluoresence.ANP rats had more severe histopathological injuries in pancreas and distal ileum, injured intestinal barrier and increased expression of TNFα, IL-1β and IL-17A in plasma and distal ileum compared with those of the sham-operated (SO) group. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed structural segregation between the SO and ANP groups. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) number and ACE index revealed decreased microbiota diversity in the ANP group. Taxonomic analysis showed dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota structure. At phyla level, Saccharibacteria and Tenericutes decreased significantly. At genus level, Escherichia-Shigella and Phascolarctobacterium increased significantly, while Candidatus_Saccharimonas, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-001, Ruminiclostridium_5 and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-008 decreased significantly. Lysozyme and α-defensin5 mRNA expression levels decreased significantly in ANP group at 48h. Protein expression of lysozyme decreased in ANP groups at 24h and 48h. Meanwhile, the relative abundance of Escherichia-Shigella correlated inversely with the decrease in lysozyme.The disorder in intestinal microbiota and decreases of Paneth cell antimicrobial peptides might participate in the pathogenesis of intestinal barrier dysfunction during ANP."
https://openalex.org/W2609840303,"Mortality associated with breast cancer is attributable to aggressive metastasis, to which TNFα plays a central orchestrating role. TNFα acts on breast tumor TNF receptors evoking the release of chemotactic proteins (e.g. MCP-1/CCL2). These proteins direct inward infiltration/migration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), T-regulatory cells (Tregs), T helper IL-17-producing cells (Th17s), metastasis-associated macrophages (MAMs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Tumor embedded infiltrates collectively enable immune evasion, tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In the current study, we investigate the potential of apigenin, a known anti-inflammatory constituent of parsley, to downregulate TNFα mediated release of chemokines from human triple-negative cells (MDA-MB-231 cells). The results show that TNFα stimulation leads to large rise of CCL2, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), IL-1α and IL-6, all suppressed by apigenin. While many aspects of the transcriptome for NFkB signaling were evaluated, the data show signaling patterns associated with CCL2 were blocked by apigenin and mediated through suppressed mRNA and protein synthesis of IKBKe. Moreover, the data show that the attenuation of CCL2 by apigenin in the presence TNFα paralleled the suppression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK 1/ 2). In summary, the obtained findings suggest that there exists a TNFα evoked release of CCL2 and other LSP recruiting cytokines from human breast cancer cells, which can be attenuated by apigenin."
https://openalex.org/W2609431142,"Recent studies evaluating horses in training and considered free from lameness by their owners have identified a large proportion of horses with motion asymmetries. However the prevalence, type and magnitude of asymmetries when trotting in a straight line or on the lunge have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to objectively investigate the presence of motion asymmetries in riding horses in training by identifying the side and quantifying the degree and type (impact, pushoff) of forelimb and hind limb asymmetries found during straight line trot and on the lunge. In a cross-sectional study, vertical head and pelvic movement symmetry was measured in 222 Warmblood type riding horses, all without perceived performance issues and considered free from lameness by their owners. Body-mounted uni-axial accelerometers were used and differences between maximum and minimum head (HDmax, HDmin) and pelvic (PDmax, PDmin) vertical displacement between left and right forelimb and hind limb stances were calculated during straight line trot and on the lunge. Previously reported symmetry thresholds were used. The thresholds for symmetry were exceeded in 161 horses for at least one variable while trotting in a straight line, HDmin (n = 58, mean 14.3 mm, SD 7.1), HDmax (n = 41, mean 12.7 mm, SD 5.5), PDmax (n = 87, mean 6.5 mm, SD 3.10), PDmin (n = 79, mean 5.7 mm, SD 2.1). Contralateral and ipsilateral concurrent forelimb and hind limb asymmetries were detected in 41 and 49 horses, respectively. There was a linear association between the straight line PDmin values and the values on the lunge with the lame limb to the inside of the circle. A large proportion (72.5%) of horses in training which were perceived as free from lameness by their owner showed movement asymmetries above previously reported asymmetry thresholds during straight line trot. It is not known to what extent these asymmetries are related to pain or to mechanical abnormalities. Therefore, one of the most important questions that must be addressed is how objective asymmetry scores can be translated into pain, orthopedic abnormality, or any type of unsoundness."
https://openalex.org/W2609560535,"Immunoglobulin E and its interactions with receptors FcϵRI and CD23 play a central role in allergic disease. Omalizumab, a clinically approved therapeutic antibody, inhibits the interaction between IgE and FcϵRI, preventing mast cell and basophil activation, and blocks IgE binding to CD23 on B cells and antigen-presenting cells. We solved the crystal structure of the complex between an omalizumab-derived Fab and IgE-Fc, with one Fab bound to each Cϵ3 domain. Free IgE-Fc adopts an acutely bent structure, but in the complex it is only partially bent, with large-scale conformational changes in the Cϵ3 domains that inhibit the interaction with FcϵRI. CD23 binding is inhibited sterically due to overlapping binding sites on each Cϵ3 domain. Studies of omalizumab Fab binding in solution demonstrate the allosteric basis for FcϵRI inhibition and, together with the structure, reveal how omalizumab may accelerate dissociation of receptor-bound IgE from FcϵRI, exploiting the intrinsic flexibility and allosteric potential of IgE."
https://openalex.org/W2610086359,"Maternal obesity is known to predispose offspring to metabolic and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. While the mechanisms underlying these phenomena are unclear, high fat diets dramatically alter intestinal microbiota, and gut microbiota can impact physiological function. To determine if maternal diet-induced gut dysbiosis can disrupt offspring neurobehavioral function, we transplanted high fat diet- (HFD) or control low fat diet-associated (CD) gut microbiota to conventionally-housed female mice. Recipient mice were then bred and the behavioral phenotype of male and female offspring was tracked. While maternal behavior was unaffected, neonatal offspring from HFD dams vocalized less upon maternal separation than pups from CD dams. Furthermore, weaned male offspring from HFD dams had significant and selective disruptions in exploratory, cognitive, and stereotypical/compulsive behavior compared to male offspring from CD dams; while female offspring from HFD dams had increases in body weight and adiposity. 16S metagenomic analyses confirmed establishment of divergent microbiota in CD and HFD dams, with alterations in diversity and taxonomic distribution throughout pregnancy and lactation. Likewise, significant alterations in gut microbial diversity and distribution were noted in offspring from HFD dams compared to CD dams, and in males compared to females. Regression analyses of behavioral performance against differentially represented taxa suggest that decreased representation of specific members of the Firmicutes phylum predict behavioral decline in male offspring. Collectively, these data establish that high fat diet-induced maternal dysbiosis is sufficient to disrupt behavioral function in murine offspring in a sex-specific manner. Thus these data reinforce the essential link between maternal diet and neurologic programming in offspring and suggest that intestinal dysbiosis could link unhealthy modern diets to the increased prevalence of neurodevelopmental and childhood disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2608753911,"Cytokines, including receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) and TNF, induce increased osteoclast (OC) formation and bone loss in postmenopausal osteoporosis and inflammatory arthritides. RANKL and TNF can independently induce OC formation in vitro from WT OC precursors via TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) adaptor proteins, which bind to their receptors. Of these, only TRAF6 is required for RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. Here we report that RANKL induced the formation of bone-resorbing OCs from TRAF6−/− OC precursors when cultured on bone slices but not on plastic. The mechanisms involved increased TNF production by TRAF6−/− OC precursors resulting from their interaction with bone matrix and release of active TGFβ from the resorbed bone, coupled with RANKL-induced autophagolysosomal degradation of TRAF3, a known inhibitor of OC formation. Consistent with these findings, RANKL enhanced TNF-induced OC formation from TRAF6−/− OC precursors. Moreover, TNF induced significantly more OCs from mice with TRAF3 conditionally deleted in myeloid lineage cells, and it did not inhibit RANKL-induced OC formation from these cells. TRAF6−/− OC precursors that overexpressed TRAF3 or were treated with the autophagolysosome inhibitor chloroquine formed significantly fewer OCs in response to TNF alone or in combination with RANKL. We conclude that RANKL can enhance TNF-induced OC formation independently of TRAF6 by degrading TRAF3. These findings suggest that preventing TRAF3 degradation with drugs like chloroquine could reduce excessive OC formation in diseases in which bone resorption is increased in response to elevated production of these cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2608791215,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale membrane-derived vesicles that serve as intercellular messengers carrying lipids, proteins, and genetic material. Substantial evidence has shown that cancer-derived EVs, secreted by tumor cells into the blood and other bodily fluids, play a critical role in modulating the tumor microenvironment and affecting the pathogenesis of cancer. Here we demonstrate for the first time that squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) EVs were enriched with the C-terminal fragment of desmoglein 2 (Dsg2), a desmosomal cadherin often overexpressed in malignancies. Overexpression of Dsg2 increased EV release and mitogenic + fibroblasts. Furthermore, SCC EVs activated Erk1/2 and Akt signaling and enhanced fibroblast cell proliferation. In vivo, Dsg2 was highly up-regulated in the head and neck SCCs, and EVs isolated from sera of patients with SCC were enriched in Dsg2 C-terminal fragment and epidermal growth factor receptor. This study defines a mechanism by which Dsg2 expression in cancer cells can modulate the tumor microenvironment, a step critical for tumor progression.—Overmiller, A. M., Pierluissi, J.

https://openalex.org/W2609584975,"Knowing the reproductive characteristics of a species is essential for the appropriate conservation and management of wildlife. In this study, we investigated the demographic parameters, including age of primiparity, litter size, inter-birth interval, reproductive rate, and cub survival rate, of Hokkaido brown bears (Ursus arctos yesoensis) in the Rusha area on the Shiretoko Peninsula, Hokkaido, Japan, based on a long-term, individual-based monitoring survey. A total of 15 philopatric females were observed nearly every year from 2006 to 2016, and these observations were used to estimate reproductive parameters. The mean age of primiparity was 5.3 ± 0.2 (SE) years (n = 7, 95% CI = 5.0–5.6). We observed 81 cubs in 46 litters from 15 bears. Litter size ranged from one to three cubs, and averaged 1.76 ± 0.08 (SE) cubs/litter (95% CI = 1.61–1.91). Inter-birth intervals ranged from 1 to 4 years, and the mean value was estimated as 2.43 (95% CI = 2.16–2.76) and 2.53 (95% CI = 2.26–2.85) years in all litters and in litters that survived at least their first year, respectively. The reproductive rate was estimated from 0.70 to 0.76 young born/year/reproductive adult female, depending on the method of calculation. The cub survival rate between 0.5 and 1.5 years ranged from 60 to 73%. Most cub disappearances occurred in July and August, suggesting that cub mortality is mainly due to poor nutrition in the summer. All reproductive parameters observed in the Rusha area on the Shiretoko Peninsula fell within the range reported in Europe and North America, and were among the lowest or shortest age of primiparity, litter size, and inter-birth intervals, and ranked at a high level for reproductive rate."

Thermal radiation and non-uniform heat source/sink are considered. The convective boundary conditions at surface are imposed. Nonlinear expressions of momentum, energy and concentration are transformed into dimensionless systems. Convergent homotopic solutions of the governing systems are worked out by employing homotopic procedure. Impact of physical variables on the velocity, temperature and concentration distributions are sketched and discussed. Numerical computations for skin friction coefficient, local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are carried out. It is concluded that velocity field enhances for Deborah number while reverse situation is observed regarding ratio of relaxation to retardation times. Temperature and heat transfer rate are enhanced via larger thermal Biot number. Effect of Schmidt number on the concentration and local Sherwood number is quite reverse."
https://openalex.org/W2607900962,"This study examined the role of route previewing strategies on climbing fluency and on exploratory movements of the limbs, in order to understand whether previewing helps people to perceive and to realize affordances. Eight inexperienced and ten experienced climbers previewed a 10 m high route of 5b difficulty on French scale, then climbed it with a top-rope as fluently as possible. Gaze behavior was collected from an eye tracking system during the preview and allowed us to determine the number of times they scanned the route, and which of four route previewing strategies (fragmentary, ascending, zigzagging, and sequence-of-blocks) they used. Five inertial measurement units (IMU) (3D accelerometer, 3D gyroscope, 3D magnetometer) were attached to the hip, both feet, and forearms to analyze the vertical acceleration and direction of each limb and hip during the ascent. We were able to detect movement and immobility phases of each IMU using segmentation and classification processes. Depending on whether the limbs and/or hip were moving, five states of behavior were detected: immobility, postural regulation, hold exploration, hold change, and hold traction. Using cluster analysis we identified four clusters of gaze behavior during route previewing depending on route preview duration, number of scan paths, fixations duration, ascending, zigzagging, and sequence-of-blocks strategies. The number of scan paths was positively correlated with relative duration of exploration and negatively correlated with relative duration of hold changes during the ascent. Additionally, a high relative duration of sequence-of-blocks strategy and zigzagging strategy were associated with a high relative duration of immobility during the ascent. Route previewing might help to pick up functional information about reachable, graspable, and usable holds, in order to chain movements together and to find the route. In other words, route previewing might contribute to perceiving and realizing nested affordances."
https://openalex.org/W2608563336,"It is assumed that salinity enhances the concentration of valuable metabolites in halophytes. The objective was to find a salt concentration and a point in time at which the yield for the valuable metabolites was maximal. Therefore, three different halophyte species were grown under different salinities and harvested over a period from shortly after stress induction up to three weeks. Various reaction patterns were found in the metabolite composition of the analyzed plant material. Halimione portulacoides showed a “short term response”, indicated by an increase in all metabolites analyzed after a few hours, whereas Crithmum maritimum showed a “long term response” through accumulation of proline starting after days. Triglochin maritima did not change in metabolite concentration, but like the other plant species the biomass was reduced by salinity. Generally, a higher production in secondary metabolites by higher salinity was outbalanced by a reduction in biomass production. Concentrations of analyzed antioxidants showed a similar reaction and correlated with each other."
https://openalex.org/W2609934552,"Pluripotent stem cells (PSC) hold great promise for the treatment of human skeletal muscle diseases. However, it remains challenging to convert PSC to skeletal muscle cells, and the mechanisms by which the master regulatory transcription factor, Pax7, promotes muscle stem (satellite) cell identity are not yet understood. We have taken advantage of PSC-derived skeletal muscle precursor cells (iPax7), wherein the induced expression of Pax7 robustly initiates the muscle program and enables the in vitro generation of precursors that seed the satellite cell compartment upon transplantation. Remarkably, we found that chromatin accessibility in myogenic precursors pre-figures subsequent activation of myogenic differentiation genes. We also found that Pax7 binding is generally restricted to euchromatic regions and excluded from H3K27 tri-methylated regions in muscle cells, suggesting that recruitment of this factor is circumscribed by chromatin state. Further, we show that Pax7 binding induces dramatic, localized remodeling of chromatin characterized by the acquisition of histone marks associated with enhancer activity and induction of chromatin accessibility in both muscle precursors and lineage-committed myoblasts. Conversely, removal of Pax7 leads to rapid reversal of these features on a subset of enhancers. Interestingly, another cluster of Pax7 binding sites is associated with a durably accessible and remodeled chromatin state after removal of Pax7, and persistent enhancer accessibility is associated with subsequent, proximal binding by the muscle regulatory factors, MyoD1 and myogenin. Our studies provide new insights into the epigenetic landscape of skeletal muscle stem cells and precursors and the role of Pax7 in satellite cell specification."
https://openalex.org/W2608745823,"The biosynthesis of multiple secondary metabolites in the phytopathogenic ascomycete Fusarium fujikuroi is strongly affected by nitrogen availability. Here, we present the first genome-wide transcriptome and proteome analysis that compared the wild type and deletion mutants of the two major nitrogen regulators AreA and AreB. We show that AreB acts not simply as an antagonist of AreA counteracting the expression of AreA target genes as suggested based on the yeast model. Both GATA transcription factors affect a large and diverse set of common as well as specific target genes and proteins, acting as activators and repressors. We demonstrate that AreA and AreB are not only involved in fungal nitrogen metabolism, but also in the control of several complex cellular processes like carbon metabolism, transport and secondary metabolism. We show that both GATA transcription factors can be considered as master regulators of secondary metabolism as they affect the expression of more than half of the 47 putative secondary metabolite clusters identified in the genome of F. fujikuroi. While AreA acts as a positive regulator of many clusters under nitrogen-limiting conditions, AreB is able to activate and repress gene clusters (e.g. bikaverin) under nitrogen limitation and sufficiency. In addition, ChIP analyses revealed that loss of AreA or AreB causes histone modifications at some of the regulated gene clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2607716350,"Migration is one of the risk factors for the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). The increasing influx of migrants challenges local health care systems. To provide evidence for both hospital hygiene measure and empirical antibiotic therapy, we analysed all cultures performed in asylum seekers between January 1st 2014 and December 31st 2015 for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and for multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDRE). We compared these with cultures from the Dutch patient population with risk factors for carriage of MDRO. A total of 7181 patients were screened for MRSA. 7357 S. aureus were isolated in clinical cultures. Of 898 screened asylum seekers, almost 10% were MRSA positive. Of 118 asylum seekers with S. aureus in clinical cultures almost 19% were MRSA positive. The general patient population had a 1.3% rate of MRSA in S. aureus isolates. A higher rate of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) positive strains (RR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.6-3.4) was found in asylum seekers compared to the general patient population. In 33475 patients one or more Enterobacteriaceae were obtained. More than 21% of the asylum seekers were carrier of MDRE, most of them producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (20.3%). 5.1% of the general patient population was MDRE carrier. It can be concluded that asylum seekers present with higher rate of MDRO compared to the general patient population. These results justify continued screening of asylum seekers to anticipate multidrug-resistant organisms during hospital care of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2609911374,"Ethanol is a teratogen, inducing a variety of structural defects in developing humans and animals that are exposed in utero. Mechanisms of ethanol teratogenicity in specific defects are not well understood. Oxidative metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase or cytochrome P450 2E1 has been implicated in some of ethanol’s teratogenic effects, either via production of acetaldehyde or competitive inhibition of retinoic acid synthesis. Generalized oxidative stress in response to ethanol may also play a role in its teratogenicity. Among the developmental defects that ethanol has been implicated in is holoprosencephaly, a failure to define the midline of the forebrain and midface that is associated with a deficiency in Sonic hedgehog pathway function. Etiologically, holoprosencephaly is thought to arise from a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors. We have developed a gene-environment interaction model of holoprosencephaly in mice, in which mutation of the Sonic hedgehog coreceptor, Cdon, synergizes with transient in utero exposure to ethanol. This system was used to address whether oxidative metabolism is required for ethanol’s teratogenic activity in holoprosencephaly. We report here that t-butyl alcohol, which is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenases or Cyp2E1, is a potent inducer of holoprosencephaly in Cdon mutant mice. Additionally, antioxidant treatment did not prevent ethanol- or t-butyl alcohol-induced HPE in these mice. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that ethanol itself, rather than a consequence of its metabolism, is a holoprosencephaly-inducing teratogen."
https://openalex.org/W2608890285,"Cancer is sometimes depicted as a reversion to single cell behavior in cells adapted to live in a multicellular assembly. If this is the case, one would expect that mutation in cancer disrupts functional mechanisms that suppress cell-level traits detrimental to multicellularity. Such mechanisms should have evolved with or after the emergence of multicellularity. This leads to two related, but distinct hypotheses: 1) Somatic mutations in cancer will occur in genes that are younger than the emergence of multicellularity (1000 million years [MY]); and 2) genes that are frequently mutated in cancer and whose mutations are functionally important for the emergence of the cancer phenotype evolved within the past 1000 million years, and thus would exhibit an age distribution that is skewed to younger genes. In order to investigate these hypotheses we estimated the evolutionary ages of all human genes and then studied the probability of mutation and their biological function in relation to their age and genomic location for both normal germline and cancer contexts. We observed that under a model of uniform random mutation across the genome, controlled for gene size, genes less than 500 MY were more frequently mutated in both cases. Paradoxically, causal genes, defined in the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census, were depleted in this age group. When we used functional enrichment analysis to explain this unexpected result we discovered that COSMIC genes with recessive disease phenotypes were enriched for DNA repair and cell cycle control. The non-mutated genes in these pathways are orthologous to those underlying stress-induced mutation in bacteria, which results in the clustering of single nucleotide variations. COSMIC genes were less common in regions where the probability of observing mutational clusters is high, although they are approximately 2-fold more likely to harbor mutational clusters compared to other human genes. Our results suggest this ancient mutational response to stress that evolved among prokaryotes was co-opted to maintain diversity in the germline and immune system, while the original phenotype is restored in cancer. Reversion to a stress-induced mutational response is a hallmark of cancer that allows for effectively searching “protected” genome space where genes causally implicated in cancer are located and underlies the high adaptive potential and concomitant therapeutic resistance that is characteristic of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2609205512,"The CRISPR-Cas systems provide invader defense in a wide variety of prokaryotes, as well as technologies for many powerful applications. The Type III-A or Csm CRISPR-Cas system is one of the most widely distributed across prokaryotic phyla, and cleaves targeted DNA and RNA molecules. In this work, we have constructed modules of Csm systems from 3 bacterial species and heterologously expressed the functional modules in E. coli. The modules include a Cas6 protein and a CRISPR locus for crRNA production, and Csm effector complex proteins. The expressed modules from L. lactis, S. epidermidis and S. thermophilus specifically eliminate invading plasmids recognized by the crRNAs of the systems. Characteristically, activation of plasmid targeting activity depends on transcription of the plasmid sequence recognized by the crRNA. Activity was not observed when transcription of the crRNA target sequence was blocked, or when the opposite strand or a non-target sequence was transcribed. Moreover, the Csm module can be programmed to recognize plasmids with novel target sequences by addition of appropriate crRNA coding sequences to the module. These systems provide a platform for investigation of Type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems in E. coli, and for introduction of programmable transcription-activated DNA targeting into novel organisms."

Existing metaheuristic tuning methods have been proven to be quite successful but there were observable areas that need improvements especially in terms of the system’s gain overshoot and steady steady state errors. Using the ABO algorithm where each buffalo location in the herd is a candidate solution to the Proportional-Integral-Derivative parameters was very helpful in addressing these two areas of concern. The encouraging results obtained from the simulation of the PID Controller parameters-tuning using the ABO when compared with the performance of Genetic Algorithm PID (GA-PID), Particle-Swarm Optimization PID (PSO-PID), Ant Colony Optimization PID (ACO-PID), PID, Bacteria-Foraging Optimization PID (BFO-PID) etc makes ABO-PID a good addition to solving PID Controller tuning problems using metaheuristics."
https://openalex.org/W2609702809,"The conserved protein complex known as Mediator conveys transcriptional signals by acting as an intermediary between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. As a result, Mediator subunits play multiple roles in regulating developmental as well as abiotic and biotic stress pathways. In this report we identify the head domain subunits MEDIATOR18 and MEDIATOR20 as important susceptibility factors for Fusarium oxysporum infection in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutants of MED18 and MED20 display down-regulation of genes associated with jasmonate signaling and biosynthesis while up-regulation of salicylic acid associated pathogenesis related genes and reactive oxygen producing and scavenging genes. We propose that MED18 and MED20 form a sub-domain within Mediator that controls the balance of salicylic acid and jasmonate associated defense pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2607906390,"Rice-rice system and rice fallows are no longer productive in Southeast Asia. Crop and varietal diversification of the rice based cropping systems may improve the productivity and profitability of the systems. Diversification is also a viable option to mitigate the risk of climate change. In Eastern India, farmers cultivate rice during rainy season (June-September) and land leftovers fallow after rice harvest in the post-rainy season (November-May) due to lack of sufficient rainfall or irrigation amenities. However, in lowland areas, sufficient residual soil moistures are available in rice fallow in the post-rainy season (November-March), which can be utilized for raising second crops in the region. Implementation of suitable crop/varietal diversification is thus very much vital to achieve this objective. To assess the yield performance of rice varieties under timely and late sown conditions and to evaluate the performance of dry season crops following them, three different duration rice cultivars were transplanted in July and August. In dry season several non-rice crops were sown in rice fallow to constitute a cropping system. The results revealed that tiller occurrence, biomass accumulation, dry matter remobilization, crop growth rate, and ultimately yield were significantly decreased under late transplanting. On an average, around 30% yield reduction obtained under late sowing may be due to low temperature stress and high rainfall at reproductive stages of the crop. Dry season crops following short duration rice cultivars performed better in terms of grain yield. In the dry season, toria was profitable when sown earlier and if sowing was delayed greengram was suitable. Highest system productivity and profitability under timely sown rice may be due to higher dry matter remobilization from source to sink. A significant correlation was observed between biomass production and grain yield. We infer that late transplanting decrease the tiller occurrence and assimilate remobilization efficiency, which may be responsible for the reduced grain yield."

Tongue malformations such as aglossia, microglossia, and ankyloglossia are congenital birth defects, greatly affecting individuals' quality of life. However, the molecular basis of the tissue-tissue interactions that ensure tissue morphogenesis to form a functional tongue remains largely unknown. Here we show that ShhCre-mediated epithelial deletion of Wntless (Wls), the key regulator for intracellular Wnt trafficking, leads to lingual hypoplasia in mice. Disruption of epithelial Wnt production by Wls deletion in epithelial cells led to a failure in lingual epidermal stratification and loss of the lamina propria and the underlying superior longitudinal muscle in developing mouse tongues. These defective phenotypes resulted from a reduction in epithelial basal cells positive for the basal epidermal marker protein p63 and from impaired proliferation and differentiation in connective tissue and paired box 3 (Pax3)- and Pax7-positive muscle progenitor cells. We also found that epithelial Wnt production is required for activation of the Notch signaling pathway, which promotes proliferation of myogenic progenitor cells. Notch signaling in turn negatively regulated Wnt signaling during tongue morphogenesis. We further show that Pax7 is a direct Notch target gene in the embryonic tongue. In summary, our findings demonstrate a key role for the lingual epithelial signals in supporting the integrity of the lamina propria and muscular tissue during tongue development and that a Wnt/Notch/Pax7 genetic hierarchy is involved in this development.

https://openalex.org/W2608267042,"Sex discordance in asthma prevalence has been previously reported, with higher prevalence in males before puberty, and in females after puberty; the adolescent “switch”. However, cross-sectional studies have suggested a narrowing of this discordance in recent decades. We used a combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal modelling to examine sex differences in asthma, wheeze and longitudinal wheezing phenotypes in two UK birth cohorts, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; born 1991–92 with data from age 0–18 years) and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS; born 2000–02 with data from age 3–10 years). We derived measures of asthma and wheeze from questionnaires completed by mothers and cohort children. Previously-derived ALSPAC wheezing phenotype models were applied to MCS. Males had a higher prevalence of asthma at 10.7 years in ALSPAC (OR 1.45 95%CI: 1.26, 1.66 n = 7778 for current asthma) and MCS (OR 1.42 95%CI: 1.29, 1.56 n = 6726 for asthma ever) compared to females, decreasing in ALSPAC after puberty (OR 0.94 95%CI: 0.79, 1.11 n = 5023 for current asthma at 16.5 years). In longitudinal models using restricted cubic splines, males had a clear excess for asthma in the last 12 months and wheeze in the last 12 months up until 16.5 years of age in ALSPAC. Males had an increased risk of all derived longitudinal wheezing phenotypes in MCS when compared to never wheeze and no evidence of being at lower risk of late wheeze when compared to early wheeze. By comparing data in two large, contemporary cohorts we have shown the persistence of sex discordance in childhood asthma, with no evidence that the sex discordance is narrowing in recent cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2608084115,"The functional role of Langerhans cells (LCs) in ocular surface inflammation and nerve damage in dry eye (DE) disease has yet to be determined. This study was performed to investigate this relationship through both clinical study on DE patients and in vivo mouse models with induced DE disease. In a cross-sectional case-control study (54 eyes of DE patients; 34 eyes of control patients), average cell density, area, and process length of LCs were measured using confocal microscopy. Data were analyzed to determine whether changes in LCs are correlated with subbasal nerve plexus (SNP) parameters (nerve density, beading, and tortuosity). In DE patients, SNP density marginally decreased and nerve beading and tortuosity were significantly increased compared to the control group. The total number of LCs significantly increased in DE patients, and some LCs with elongated processes were found to be attached to nerve fibers. Interestingly, nerve loss and deformation were correlated with inactivation of LCs. In an in vivo experiment to elucidate the role of LCs in ocular surface inflammation and corneal nerve loss, we used a genetically modified mouse model (CD207-DTR) that reduced the population of CD207 (Langerin) expressing cells by injection of diphtheria toxin. In CD207-depleted mice with DE disease (CD207-dDTR+DE), corneal nerves in the central region were significantly decreased, an effect that was not observed in wild-type (WT)+DE mice. In CD207-dDTR+DE mice, infiltration of CD4+, CD19+, CD45+, and CD11b+ cells into the ocular surface was increased, as confirmed by flow cytometry. Increased IL-17 and IFN-γ mRNA levels, and decreased expression of neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitters, were also found in the CD207-dDTR+DE mice. These data support a functional role for LCs in negatively regulating ocular surface inflammation and exhibiting a neuroprotective function in DE disease."
https://openalex.org/W2609681689,"To evaluate the association of acromial morphology and subacromial impingement.Bilateral shoulder computed tomography was performed in 138 patients who received shoulder arthroscopy. Measured parameters included: acromial tilt (AT), modified acromial tilt (mAT), acromial slope (AS), acromiohumeral interval (AHI), lateral acromial angle (LAA), acromial index (AI), critical shoulder angle (CSA), acromial anterior protrusion (AAP), and acromial inferior protrusion (AIP). Acromial morphological characteristics were compared between groups. Side-to-side differences were assessed between affected and non-affected shoulders. Intra- and inter-observer agreements for each parameter were calculated.AT (25.90 vs. 29.41°), mAT (18.88 vs. 22.64°), and AHI (5.46 vs. 6.47 mm) were significantly smaller in impinged patients. The impingement group demonstrated significantly larger AI (63.50 vs. 59.84%), CSA (31.78 vs. 28.74°), AAP (7.13 vs. 5.32 mm), and AIP (5.51 vs. 4.04 mm). Regarding side-to-side comparison, the acromial morphology was significantly different between the affected and non-affected shoulders in impinged patients, while the difference was slight and insignificant in control patients. All, except AS and LAA, measured parameters demonstrated good intra- and inter-observer agreements.Three-dimensional reconstructed CT scan is a reliable method to measure shoulder morphology. The acromial morphological variation is related with sub acromial impingement, however, the causal relationship of them should be further explored."

Proteins including DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1) and dysbindin-1B are found in insoluble forms within brain homogenates from such patients. We recently identified TRIOBP-1 (Trio-binding protein 1, also known as Tara) to be another such protein through an epitope discovery and proteomics approach by comparing post-mortem brain material from schizophrenia patients and control individuals. We hypothesized that this was likely to occur as a result of a specific subcellular process and that it, therefore, should be possible to identify a region of the TRIOBP-1 protein that is essential for its aggregation to occur. Here, we probe the domain organization of TRIOBP-1, finding it to possess two distinct coiled-coil domains: the central and C-terminal domains.

This was based on the hypothesis that disrupted protein homeostasis in post-mitotic neurons is likely to characterize subtypes of chronic mental illness (7Korth C. Aggregated proteins in schizophrenia and other chronic mental diseases: DISC1opathies.Prion. 2012; 6: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this manner, an antibody against TRIOBP-1 was found to show specificity for the pooled purified insoluble protein fractions of post-mortem brain samples from schizophrenia patients compared with an equivalent preparation prepared from brain samples of control individuals (8Bradshaw N.J.

The specific roles of TRIOBP-1 in the brain are not well studied; however, more generally it is known to be a critical promoter of actin polymerization, binding directly to polymerized fibers of F-actin (3Seipel K.

The latter occurs through its interaction with nuclear distribution element-like 1 (NDEL1) (11Hong J.-H. Kwak Y. Woo Y. Park C. Lee S.-A. Lee H. Park S.J. Suh Y. Suh B.K. Goo B.S. Mun D.J. Sanada K.

Small, but statistically significant, increases in TRIOBP transcript expression have also been detected in post-mortem brain tissue of schizophrenia patients from two independent samples (13Maycox P.R.

The misassembly of TRIOBP-1 protein into insoluble aggregates in mental illness could arise either because the protein is naturally “sticky,” with a tendency to self-interact in a nonspecific manner or as the result of a specific physiological mechanism. Such mechanisms could include, for example, the addition or removal of a protein-binding partner, a post-translational modification, interaction with a small molecule, or an error during protein folding. We hypothesized that, were a specific mechanism involved, it should be possible to isolate individual regions of the protein that were involved in this process (either small motifs or entire folded domains) and that are, therefore, required for aggregation of TRIOBP-1. In this manuscript we, therefore, investigate the domain structure of TRIOBP-1 and establish that such an aggregation-critical region exists that can be narrowed down to a stretch of just 25 amino acids (aa), strongly supporting the idea that a specific mechanism exists by which TRIOBP-1 forms insoluble aggregates. Previous predictions have suggested that TRIOBP-1 (RefSeq accession number NP_008963.3) contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain near its N terminus, whereas the majority of its C-terminal half forms α-helices, most likely in the form of coiled-coil domains (3Seipel K.

Keating A.E. Berger B. Paircoil2: improved prediction of coiled coils from sequence.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In this manner we predicted the existence of six distinct putative coiled coils (Fig. 1D) in human TRIOBP-1, which will be referred to as CC1-CC6. Of these, CC3, CC4, and CC5 are comparatively long stretches (running from approximately aa 395–465, aa 473–550, and aa 566–617, respectively), whereas CC1, CC2, and CC6 are shorter (aa 303–322, aa 352–372, and aa 623–642 respectively).

Amino acid numbers quoted here for the 652-aa protein can, therefore, be converted directly to positions in the 593-aa protein considered elsewhere by subtracting 59. We chose to include this additional 59-aa N-terminal region in the amino acid numbering system as it is relatively well conserved and maintaining its reading frame throughout mammalian species (Fig. 2A). Nevertheless, TRIOBP-1 species containing this region appear to represent a minority in cells (Fig. 2B) and, therefore, arise either from a less common translation event or else they represent the approximate position of a “pro” domain, which is normally cleaved off in the cell. This 59-aa N-terminal region is rich in both prolines and positively charged residues and localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus when expressed in neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 2C). To determine which regions have the potential to exist as distinct folded domains in vivo, different fragments of TRIOBP-1 were expressed as recombinant proteins. This was based on the premise that compactly folded protein domains are more likely to form soluble recombinant proteins, with distinct oligomeric states, both in bacteria and in vitro. In contrast, constructs encoding only part of such a region would instead be more likely to either degrade or form insoluble aggregates. In support of this idea, we began by investigating the strongly predicted PH domain at the N terminus of TRIOBP-1. Expression of the whole PH domain (aa 60–189) led to a soluble recombinant protein that stably formed a dimer (apparent molecular mass of ≈30 kDa compared with a predicted molecular mass of 17.3 kDa) as analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC, Fig. 3A). Circular dichroism (CD) analysis confirmed this protein to be structured, with a high β-sheet content, ∼50% as predicted in DichroWeb using the CDSSTR method and SMP180 dataset (21Whitmore L.

In contrast, expression of a shorter construct lacking the N-terminal-most predicted β-strand of the PH domain (aa 93–189) led to an unstable recombinant protein. Specifically, the protein formed a high-oligomeric-state void-volume species (Fig. 3A), excepting for a portion of the protein that instead broke down to yield a smaller soluble product (Fig. 3C). Based on the principle that solubility and stability of a recombinant protein fragment in vitro can indicate the presence of distinct and complete folded domains in vivo, as exemplified here by the PH domain, the structure of the C-terminal half of TRIOBP-1 was investigated. When this whole coiled-coil region (aa 281–652) was expressed, it broke down within the bacteria into a number of discrete species (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that the coiled-coil regions consists of at least two distinctly folded domains. Based on the sizes of the fragments detected with antibodies raised against different regions of the coiled-coil region, a break between CC4 and CC5 was predicted. In agreement with this, expression of the extreme two C-terminal coiled coils of TRIOBP-1 (CC5 and CC6, aa 556–652) led to a single stable monomeric protein (Fig. 4C, observed molecular mass ≈20 kDa, predicted molecular mass 14 kDa; the discrepancy likely arising from coiled-coil protein forming an elongated structure), which has a predominantly α-helical structure as determined by CD (Fig. 4D). In contrast, inclusion of CC4 in the construct (CC4-CC6, aa 467–652) led to an unstable protein that broke down before purification (Fig. 4E). Together this implies that CC5–6 constitutes a distinctly folded structure that we refer to as the “C-terminal domain.” Expression of CC1-CC4 instead led to a predominant multimeric species with an apparent molecular mass of ∼200 kDa (Fig. 5A, aa 281–555, predicted molecular mass for a monomer: 34.2 kDa), suggestive of a hexamer. CD demonstrated it to be principally α-helical (Fig. 5B). This multimer was prone to precipitation at high concentrations, and there was some evidence of degradation of the protein (80–100 ml in Fig. 5A, also visible in Fig. 6E), suggesting that this protein fragment was largely, but not completely, stable in vitro. A further truncated recombinant protein containing CC1-CC3 was highly stable even at concentrations of >10 mg/ml and existed as seemingly the same single oligomeric species as the CC1-CC4 protein (Fig. 5C, aa 281–466, apparent molecular mass ≈160 kDa; predicted molecular mass of a monomer 24 kDa, again suggestive of a hexamer) and also had a high helical content (Fig. 5D). Although these in vitro analyses may not necessarily completely reflect the situation in vivo, they strongly suggest that CC1-CC3 of TRIOBP-1 forms a folded “central domain,” potentially also including CC4 but distinct from the C-terminal domain of CC5 and CC6.Figure 6The oligomeric state of the central domain, analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation.

The left two panels were stained from one membrane, and the right two panels were from another displaying identical samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When only the short CC1 and CC2 coiled regions were expressed, the ensuing protein appeared to be either a trimer or an extended dimer (Fig. 5E, aa 281–382, apparent molecular mass ≈40 kDa, predicted molecular mass for a monomer 14.1 kDa) and to be reasonably stable, although less so than the CC1-CC3 protein and with a lower α-helix content (Fig. 5F). Expression of CC2 and CC3 led to a similarly stable trimeric protein (Fig. 5G, aa 349–466, apparent molecular mass ≈55 kDa, predicted molecular mass for a monomer 16.2 kDa), which consisted almost entirely of α-helical structure (Fig. 5H). To further investigate the oligomeric state of the central domain, these constructs were investigated using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). AUC sedimentation velocity experiments showed the CC1-CC2 fragment to exist predominantly as a species with an estimated molecular mass of 26.0 kDa (Perrin factor, s20,w = 1.15 S; Fig. 6, A and B), consistent with a dimer. It had a frictional ratio of 1.61, indicative of an extended conformation. Under the same experimental circumstances, most of the CC2-CC3 construct adopted an oligomeric state consistent with a monomer, and only 1.8% of the protein remained as a species matching the one seen by SEC, with a predicted molecular mass of 49.4 kDa (s20,w = 3.46 S; Fig. 6, A and C). This region was even more elongated that CC1-CC2, with a frictional ratio of 1.82, consistent with an extended coiled coil structure. When CC1-CC3 was similarly examined it did not maintain the same high-order oligomeric state seen by SEC, with an apparent trimer being the largest species (observed molecular mass of 76.3 kDa, compared with a theoretical molecular mass of 23.9 kDa; Fig. 6, A and D). This was also highly elongated (frictional ratio: 1.63). It, therefore, appears that the central domain trimerizes through interactions of CC2-CC3 but is also capable of forming higher order oligomers, most likely hexamers, through the additional dimer-forming capacity contained within CC1-CC2. The nature of all soluble TRIOBP-1 constructs used here could be confirmed by Western blot using anti-TRIOBP antibodies raised against different sections of the protein (Fig 6E). After identification of two distinct coiled-coil domains of TRIOBP-1, in addition to the previously predicted PH domain, initial experiments were carried out to investigate their functions in the cell, the results of which are summarized in Table 1.Table 1Summary of functional assays performed on isolated domains of TRIOBP-1PH domainCentral domainC-terminal domainLocation on TRIOBP-1Amino acids60–189281–555556–652Coiled coilsN/A1–45–6Actin assaySegregates with F-actinNoYesYesSegregates with G-actinYesYesYesEffect on F-actin depolymerizationNo effectInhibitionTrend inhibitionEffect on G-actin polymerizationNo effectNo effectTrend promotionNeurite assayEffect on neurite numberIncreaseDecreaseNo effectEffect on longest neurite lengthTrend increaseNo effectNo effect Open table in a new tab The canonical role of TRIOBP-1 is as a modulator of actin polymerization, leading to increased fibular F-actin compared with globular G-actin (3Seipel K.

The effect of the individual domains of TRIOBP-1 on actin polymerization was, therefore, investigated. NLF neuroblastoma cells were transfected with constructs encoding the PH domain, central domain (CC1–4), and C-terminal domain (CC5–6) of TRIOBP-1 and lysed in a buffer that stabilizes polymerized F-actin (26Cenni V.

The ensuing lysates were then separated by ultracentrifugation into an F-actin containing pellet and a G-actin containing supernatant (Fig. 7A). The supernatant was incubated under conditions that promote polymerization before being separated once again by ultracentrifugation into F- and G-actin-containing fractions and determining how much of the G-actin had re-polymerized in the presence of each TRIOBP-1 construct.

In the Mediterranean Sea, forty-seven oncaeid species occur, of which eleven in the Gulf of Naples. In this Gulf, several Oncaea species were morphologically analysed and described at the end of the XIX century by W. Giesbrecht. In the same area, oncaeids are being investigated over seasonal and inter-annual scales at the long-term coastal station LTER-MC. In the present work, we identified six oncaeid species using the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS rDNA) and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI). Phylogenetic analyses based on these two genomic regions validated the sisterhood of the genera Triconia and the Oncaea sensu stricto. ITS1 and ITS2 phylogenies produced incongruent results about the position of Oncaea curta, calling for further investigations on this species. We also characterised the ITS2 region by secondary structure predictions and found that all the sequences analysed presented the distinct eukaryotic hallmarks. A Compensatory Base Change search corroborated the close relationship between O. venusta and O. curta and between O. media and O. venusta already identified by ITS phylogenies. The present results, which stem from the integration of molecular and morphological taxonomy, represent an encouraging step towards an improved knowledge of copepod biodiversity: The two complementary approaches, when applied to long-term copepod monitoring, will also help to better understanding their genetic variations and ecological niches of co-occurring species."
https://openalex.org/W2949557729,"In most vertebrate neurons, spikes initiate in the axonal initial segment (AIS). When recorded in the soma, they have a surprisingly sharp onset, as if sodium (Na) channels opened abruptly. The main view stipulates that spikes initiate in a conventional manner at the distal end of the AIS, then progressively sharpen as they backpropagate to the soma. We examined the biophysical models used to substantiate this view, and we found that spikes do not initiate through a local axonal current loop that propagates along the axon, but through a global current loop encompassing the AIS and soma, which forms an electrical dipole. Therefore, the phenomenon is not adequately modeled as the backpropagation of an electrical wave along the axon, since the wavelength would be as large as the entire system. Instead, in these models, we found that spike initiation rather follows the critical resistive coupling model proposed recently, where the Na current entering the AIS is matched by the axial resistive current flowing to the soma. Besides demonstrating it by examining the balance of currents at spike initiation, we show that the observed increase in spike sharpness along the axon is artifactual and disappears when an appropriate measure of rapidness is used; instead, somatic onset rapidness can be predicted from spike shape at initiation site. Finally, we reproduce the phenomenon in a two-compartment model, showing that it does not rely on propagation. In these models, the sharp onset of somatic spikes is therefore not an artifact of observing spikes at the incorrect location, but rather the signature that spikes are initiated through a global soma-AIS current loop forming an electrical dipole."
https://openalex.org/W2607722102,"Due to recently proposed changes in the Common Rule regarding the collection of research preferences, there is an increased need for efficient methods to document opt-in research preferences at a population level. Previously, our institution developed an opt-out paper-based workflow that could not be utilized for research in a scalable fashion. This project was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing an electronic health record (EHR)-based active opt-in research preferences program. The first phase of implementation required creating and disseminating a patient questionnaire through the EHR portal to populate discreet fields within the EHR indicating patients’ preferences for future research study contact (contact) and their willingness to allow anonymised use of excess tissue and fluid specimens (biobank). In the second phase, the questionnaire was presented within a clinic nurse intake workflow in an obstetrical clinic. These permissions were tabulated in registries for use by investigators for feasibility studies and recruitment. The registry was also used for research patient contact management using a new EHR encounter type to differentiate research from clinical encounters. The research permissions questionnaire was sent to 59,670 patients via the EHR portal. Within four months, 21,814 responses (75% willing to participate in biobanking, and 72% willing to be contacted for future research) were received. Each response was recorded within a patient portal encounter to enable longitudinal analysis of responses. We obtained a significantly lower positive response from the 264 females who completed the questionnaire in the obstetrical clinic (55% volunteers for biobank and 52% for contact). We demonstrate that it is possible to establish a research permissions registry using the EHR portal and clinic-based workflows. This patient-centric, population-based, opt-in approach documents preferences in the EHR, allowing linkage of these preferences to health record information."

Methods Patients with biopsy-proven primary MCD, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy (60, 52 and 52 respectively) and 18 control subjects had urinary and serum Angptl4 measured by Elisa. Frozen kidney tissue sections were stained for Angptl4. Results Angptl4 was not identified in glomeruli of MCD patients in relapse. Urinary Angptl4 levels were elevated in MCD in relapse as well as in patients with massive proteinuria due to other glomerular diseases. Conclusion Neither serum nor urine Angptl4 appear to be good biomarkers in MCD. Elevated urinary Angptl4 n glomerular disease appears to reflect the degree of proteinuria rather than any specific disease."

We examined the relationships between leukocyte telomere length and cardiovascular and renal function in a Japanese cohort. Participants and methods We enrolled 770 subjects who each had at least one cardiovascular risk factor. The mean age was 59.5 ± 12.2 years; mean BMI was 25.1 ± 4.6 kg/m2. We measured leukocyte telomere length (LTL) by quantitative PCR (T/S ratio), and measured other biomarkers from blood and urine samples. In addition, we assessed surrogate markers of arterial stiffness, cardiovascular organ damage and kidney function, including flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), pulse wave velocity (PWV), carotid artery augmentation index (CAAI), and urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) and eGFR. Results Leukocyte telomere length (T/S ratio) was inversely associated with age (r = -0.194, P<0.001), and was lower in men (1.13 ± 0.29%) than in women (1.20 ± 0.31%, P = 0.002). T/S ratio was positively associated with BMI in women (r = 0.11, P = 0.047), but not in men. LTL did not show a significant relationship to cardiovascular surrogate markers, including arterial stiffness, FMD, and PWV, but did show some relationship to CAAI, which was inversely associated with T/S ratio only in men (r = -0.159, P = 0.015). LTL did show a significant positive association with renal function measured by eGFR (r = 0.16, P<0.001) both in men and women. Conclusions In this Japanese sample of persons with increased cardiovascular risk, telomere length showed a relationship of longer telomere length to better renal function, but did not overall show convincing association with cardiovascular measures of arterial stiffness and target organ damage."

The observed specificity of Gi/o-GPCR coupling and the high rate of Gi/o signal transduction have been hypothesized to be enabled by the existence of stable associates between Gi/o proteins and their cognate GPCRs in the inactive state (Gi/o-GPCR preassembly). To test this hypothesis, we applied the recently developed technique of two-photon polarization microscopy (2PPM) to Gαi1 subunits labeled with fluorescent proteins and four GPCRs: the α2A-adrenergic receptor, GABAB, cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R), and dopamine receptor type 2. Our experiments with non-dissociating mutants of fluorescently labeled Gαi1 subunits (exhibiting impaired dissociation from activated GPCRs) showed that 2PPM is capable of detecting GPCR-G protein interactions. 2PPM experiments with non-mutated fluorescently labeled Gαi1 subunits and α2A-adrenergic receptor, GABAB, or dopamine receptor type 2 receptors did not reveal any interaction between the Gi1 protein and the non-stimulated GPCRs. In contrast, non-stimulated CB1R exhibited an interaction with the Gi1 protein. Further experiments revealed that this interaction is caused solely by CB1R basal activity; no preassembly between CB1R and the Gi1 protein could be observed.

This study evaluated the effect of the c.662A>G SNP on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oseltamivir in humans.A single oral dose of oseltamivir at 75 mg was administered to 20 healthy subjects, 8 heterozygous c.662A>G carriers (c.662AG) and 12 non-carriers (c.662AA). The concentrations of oseltamivir and its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, were measured in plasma and urine using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. The PK parameters were calculated using a noncompartmental method. The geometric mean ratios (GMR, c.662AG to c.662AA) of the PK parameters and their 90% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.The systemic exposure to oseltamivir, as assessed by the AUC0-48h of oseltamivir, was increased by 10% in c.662AG subjects, whereas the AUC0-48h of oseltamivir carboxylate was 5% lower in c.662AG subjects. The GMR and 90% CI of the metabolic ratio (AUC0-48h, Oseltamivir carboxylate/AUC0-48h, Oseltamivir) was 0.87 (0.66-1.14). The amount of unchanged oseltamivir excreted in the urine was increased by 15% in subjects with the c.662AG genotype.This result suggests that CES1 enzymatic activity may be decreased in these heterozygous allele carriers, although further studies are warranted to investigate the clinical implications of this genetic variation on CES1 substrate drugs.ClinicalTtrials.gov NCT01902342."
https://openalex.org/W2610010525,"Temporal index decomposition analysis and spatial index decomposition analysis were applied to understand the driving forces of the emissions embodied in China’s exports and net exports during 2002–2011, respectively. The accumulated emissions embodied in exports accounted for approximately 30% of the total emissions in China; although the contribution of the sectoral total emissions intensity (technique effect) declined, the scale effect was largely responsible for the mounting emissions associated with export, and the composition effect played a largely insignificant role. Calculations of the emissions embodied in net exports suggest that China is generally in an environmentally inferior position compared with its major trade partners. The differences in the economy-wide emission intensities between China and its major trade partners were the biggest contribution to this reality, and the trade balance effect played a less important role. However, a lower degree of specialization in pollution intensive products in exports than in imports helped to reduce slightly the emissions embodied in net exports. The temporal index decomposition analysis results suggest that China should take effective measures to optimize export and supply-side structure and reduce the total emissions intensity. According to spatial index decomposition analysis, it is suggested that a more aggressive import policy was useful for curbing domestic and global emissions, and the transfer of advanced production technologies and emission control technologies from developed to developing countries should be a compulsory global environmental policy option to mitigate the possible leakage of pollution emissions caused by international trade."

GPI anchored proteins have diverse roles in cell adhesion, signaling, metabolism and complement regulation. Over 30 enzymes are required for GPI anchor biosynthesis and PIGA is involved in the first step of this process. A hypomorphic mutation in the X-linked PIGA gene (c.1234C>T) causes multiple congenital anomalies hypotonia seizure syndrome 2 (MCAHS2), indicating that even partial reduction of GPI anchored proteins dramatically impairs central nervous system development, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we established a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) model containing the PIGAc.1234C>T mutation to study the effects of a hypomorphic allele of PIGA on neuronal development. Neuronal differentiation from neural progenitor cells generated by EB formation in PIGAc.1234C>T is significantly impaired with decreased proliferation, aberrant synapse formation and abnormal membrane depolarization. The results provide direct evidence for a critical role of GPI anchor proteins in early neurodevelopment. Furthermore, neural progenitors derived from PIGAc.1234C>T hiPSCs demonstrate increased susceptibility to complement-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting that defective complement regulation may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2609462228,"The biological effects of chronic ionizing radiation exposure can be difficult to study, but important to understand in order to protect the health of occupationally-exposed persons and victims of radiological accidents or malicious events. They include targeted effects (TE) caused by ionizations within/close to nuclear DNA, and non-targeted effects (NTE) caused by damage to other cell structures and/or activation of stress-signaling pathways in distant cells. Data on radiation damage in animal populations exposed over multiple generations to wide ranges of dose rates after the Chernobyl nuclear-power-plant accident are very useful for enhancing our understanding of these processes. We used a mechanistically-motivated mathematical model which includes TE and NTE to analyze a large published data set on chromosomal aberrations in pond snail (Lymnaea stagnalis) embryos collected over 16 years from water bodies contaminated by Chernobyl fallout, and from control locations. The fraction of embryo cells with aberrations increased dramatically (>10-fold) and non-linearly over a dose rate range of 0.03-420 μGy/h (0.00026-3.7 Gy/year). NTE were very important for describing the non-linearity of this radiation response: the TE-only model (without NTE) performed dramatically worse than the TE+NTE model. NTE were predicted to reach ½ of maximal intensity at 2.5 μGy/h (0.022 Gy/year) and to contribute >90% to the radiation response slope at dose rates <11 μGy/h (0.1 Gy/year). Internally-incorporated 90Sr was possibly more effective per unit dose than other radionuclides. The radiation response shape for chromosomal aberrations in snail embryos was consistent with data for a different endpoint: the fraction of young amoebocytes in adult snail haemolymph. Therefore, radiation may affect different snail life stages by similar mechanisms. The importance of NTE in our model-based analysis suggests that the search for modulators of NTE-related signaling pathways could be a promising strategy for mitigating the deleterious effects of chronic irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2608013976,"The mode of action of trans-resveratrol, a promising lead compound for the development of neuroprotective drugs, is unknown. Data from a functional genomics study were retrieved with the aim to find differentially expressed genes that may be involved in the benefits provided by trans-resveratrol. Genes that showed a significantly different expression (p<0.05, cut-off of a two-fold change) in mice fed with a control diet or a control diet containing trans-resveratrol were different in cortex, heart and skeletal muscle. In neocortex, we identified 4 up-regulated (Strap, Pkp4, Rab2a, Cpne3) and 22 down-regulated (Actn1, Arf3, Atp6v01, Atp1a3, Atp1b2, Cacng7, Crtc1, Dbn1, Dnm1, Epn1, Gfap, Hap, Mark41, Rab5b, Nrxn2, Ogt, Palm, Ptprn2, Ptprs, Syn2, Timp2, Vamp2) genes upon trans-resveratrol consumption. Network analysis of gene products provided evidence of plakophilin 4 up-regulation as a triggering factor for down-regulation of events related to synaptic vesicle transport and neurotransmitter release via underexpression of dynamin1 and Vamp2 (synaptobrevin 2) as node-gene drivers. Analysis by RT-qPCR of some of the selected genes in a glioma cell line showed that dynamin 1 mRNA was down-regulated even in acute trans-resveratrol treatments. Taken all together, these results give insight on the glial-neuronal networks involved in the neuroprotective role of trans-resveratrol."
https://openalex.org/W2608368654,"Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent functional MRI (BOLD fMRI) during electrical paw stimulation has been widely used in studies aimed at the understanding of the somatosensory network in rats. However, despite the well-established anatomical connections between cortical and subcortical structures of the sensorimotor system, most of these functional studies have been concentrated on the cortical effects of sensory electrical stimulation. BOLD fMRI study of the integration of a sensorimotor input across the sensorimotor network requires an appropriate methodology to elicit functional activation in cortical and subcortical areas owing to the regional differences in both neuronal and vascular architectures between these brain regions. Here, using a combination of low level anesthesia, long pulse duration of the electrical stimulation along with improved spatial and temporal signal to noise ratios, we provide a functional description of the main cortical and subcortical structures of the sensorimotor rat brain. With this calibrated fMRI protocol, unilateral non-noxious sensorimotor electrical hindpaw stimulation resulted in robust positive activations in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex and bilaterally in the sensorimotor thalamus nuclei, whereas negative activations were observed bilaterally in the dorsolateral caudate-putamen. These results demonstrate that, once the experimental setup allowing necessary spatial and temporal signal to noise ratios is reached, hemodynamic changes related to neuronal activity, as preserved by the combination of a soft anesthesia with a soft muscle relaxation, can be measured within the sensorimotor network. Moreover, the observed responses suggest that increasing pulse duration of the electrical stimulus adds a proprioceptive component to the sensory input that activates sensorimotor network in the brain, and that these activation patterns are similar to those induced by digits paw's movements. These findings may find application in fMRI studies of sensorimotor disorders within cortico-basal network in rodents."
https://openalex.org/W2608026886,"Understanding the processes that influence species diversity is still a challenge in ecological studies. However, there are two main theories to discuss this topic, the niche theory and the neutral theory. Our objective was to understand the importance of environmental and spatial processes in structuring bird communities within the hydrological seasons in dry forest areas in northeastern Brazil. The study was conducted in two National Parks, the Serra da Capivara and Serra das Confusões National Parks, where 36 areas were sampled in different seasons (dry, dry/rainy transition, rainy, rainy/dry transition), in 2012 and 2013. We found with our results that bird species richness is higher in the rainy season and lower during the dry season, indicating a strong influence of seasonality, a pattern also found for environmental heterogeneity. Richness was explained by local environmental factors, while species composition was explained by environmental and spatial factors. The environmental factors were more important in explaining variations in composition. Climate change predictions have currently pointed out frequent drought events and a rise in global temperature by 2050, which would lead to changes in species behavior and to increasing desertification in some regions, including the Caatinga. In addition, the high deforestation rates and the low level of representativeness of the Caatinga in the conservation units negatively affects bird communities. This scenario has demonstrated how climatic factors affect individuals, and, therefore, should be the starting point for conservation initiatives to be developed in xeric environments."
https://openalex.org/W2609285472,"Introduction Under-five mortality estimates are increasingly used in low and middle income countries to target interventions and measure performance against global development goals. Two new methods to rapidly estimate under-5 mortality based on Summary Birth Histories (SBH) were described in a previous paper and tested with data available. This analysis tests the methods using data appropriate to each method from 5 countries that lack vital registration systems. SBH data are collected across many countries through censuses and surveys, and indirect methods often rely upon their quality to estimate mortality rates. Methods and findings The Birth History Imputation method imputes data from a recent Full Birth History (FBH) onto the birth, death and age distribution of the SBH to produce estimates based on the resulting distribution of child mortality. DHS FBHs and MICS SBHs are used for all five countries. In the implementation, 43 of 70 estimates are within 20% of validation estimates (61%). Mean Absolute Relative Error is 17.7.%. 1 of 7 countries produces acceptable estimates. The Cohort Change method considers the differences in births and deaths between repeated Summary Birth Histories at 1 or 2-year intervals to estimate the mortality rate in that period. SBHs are taken from Brazil’s PNAD Surveys 2004–2011 and validated against IGME estimates. 2 of 10 estimates are within 10% of validation estimates. Mean absolute relative error is greater than 100%. Conclusions Appropriate testing of these new methods demonstrates that they do not produce sufficiently good estimates based on the data available. We conclude this is due to the poor quality of most SBH data included in the study. This has wider implications for the next round of censuses and future household surveys across many low- and middle- income countries."

We conducted a series of replicated exposure trials using a single Global Pandemic Lineage Bd isolate from Panama (JEL 310) and concentrations of NaOCl ranging from 0.006% to 0.6% for exposure times ranging from 30 seconds to 15 minutes to determine the minimum lethal concentration of NaOCl for this isolate of Bd. Sodium hypochlorite completely killed Bd at a concentration of 0.03% during a 15-minute exposure time, while 0.12% NaOCl was effective at all exposure times (30s-15min)."
https://openalex.org/W2608845405,"Sauger (Sander canadensis) and walleye (S. vitreus) are percid fishes that naturally co-occur throughout much of the eastern United States. The native range of sauger extends into the upper Missouri River drainage where walleye did not historically occur, but have been stocked as a sport fish. Sauger populations have been declining due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and competition with non-native species, such as walleye. To effectively manage sauger populations, it is necessary to identify areas where sauger occur, and particularly where they co-occur with walleye. We developed quantitative PCR assays that can detect sauger and walleye DNA in filtered water samples. Each assay efficiently detected low quantities of target DNA and failed to detect DNA of non-target species with which they commonly co-occur."
