https://openalex.org/W2905735807,"Patients with atrial fibrillation are known to have a high risk of mortality. There is a paucity of population-based studies about the impact of atrial fibrillation on the mortality risk stratified by age, sex, and detailed causes of death.A total of 15,411 patients with atrial fibrillation from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort were enrolled, and causes of death were identified according to codes of the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases.From 2002 to 2013, a total of 4,479 (29%) deaths were confirmed, and the crude mortality rate for all-cause death was 63.3 per 1,000 patient-years. Patients with atrial fibrillation had a 3.7-fold increased risk of all-cause death compared with the general population. The standardized mortality ratio for all-cause death was the highest in young patients and decreased with increasing age (standardized mortality ratio 21.93, 95% confidence interval 7.60-26.26 in patients aged <20 years; standardized mortality ratio 2.77, 95% confidence interval 2.63-2.91 in patients aged ≥80 years). Women with atrial fibrillation exhibited a greater excess mortality risk than men (standardized mortality ratio 3.81, 95% confidence interval 3.65-3.98 in women; standardized mortality ratio 3.35, 95% confidence interval 3.21-3.48 in men). Cardiovascular disease was the leading cause of death (38.5%), and cerebral infarction was the most common specific disease. Patients with atrial fibrillation had an about 5 times increased risk of death due to cardiovascular disease compared with the general population.Patients with atrial fibrillation had a 4 times increased risk of mortality compared with the general population. However, the impact of atrial fibrillation on mortality decreased with age and in men. Cerebral infarction was the most common cause of death, and more attention should be paid to reducing the risk of stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2907076238,"The ability of Trichoderma harzianum (strain OMG-08) as plant growth promoting fungus (PGPF), was tested on Zea mays plants grown in soil pots added with different inorganic (triple superphosphate and rock phosphate) and organic (cow and horse manure composts) P fertilizers. The effect of treatments was evaluated by following the variations of plants dry biomass and nutrient content, as well as the metabolic changes in plant leaves by both GC-MS and NMR spectroscopy. A synergic effect was observed in treatments with both composts and fungus inoculation, in which not only plant growth and P uptake were enhanced, but also the expression of different metabolites related to an improved photosynthetic activity. Conversely, the combination of Trichoderma with inorganic fertilizers was less effective and even showed a reduction of plants shoot biomass and N content. The corresponding plant metabolome revealed metabolic compounds typical of biotic or abiotic stresses, which may be attributed to a reduced capacity of inorganic fertilizers to provide a sufficient P availability during plant growth. Our findings also indicate that the molecular composition of compost differentiated the Trichoderma activity in sustaining plant growth. The positive effects of the combined Trichoderma and compost treatment suggest that it may become an alternative to the phosphorus mineral fertilization."

This study investigates the factors associated with institutional deliveries among women aged 15–49 years in two regions of the Lake Zone. Data were extracted from a cross-sectional household survey of 1,214 women aged 15–49 years who had given birth in the 2 years preceding the survey in Mara and Kagera regions. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the influence of various factors on giving birth in a facility. About two-thirds (67.3%) of women gave birth at a health facility. After adjusting for possible confounders, six factors were significantly associated with institutional delivery: region (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54 [0.41–0.71]), number of children (aOR, 95% CI: 0.61 [0.42–0.91]), household wealth index (aOR, 95% CI: 1.47 [1.09–2.27]), four or more antenatal care visits (aOR, 95% CI: 1.97 [1.12–3.47]), knowing three or more pregnancy danger signs (aOR, 95% CI: 1.87 [1.27–2.76]), and number of birth preparations (aOR, 95% CI: 6.09 [3.32–11.18]). Another three factors related to antenatal care were also significant in the bivariate analysis, but these were not significantly associated with place of delivery after adjusting for all variables in an extended multivariable regression model. Giving birth in a health facility was associated both with socio-demographic factors and women’s interactions with the health care system during pregnancy. The findings show that national policies and programs promoting institutional delivery in Tanzania should tailor interventions to specific regions and reach out to low-income and high-parity women. Efforts are needed not just to increase the number of antenatal care visits made by pregnant women, but also to improve the quality and content of the interaction between women and service providers."
https://openalex.org/W2907378333,"The current marketing landscape, apart from conventional approaches, consists of campaigns designed especially for launching information diffusion processes within online networks. Associated research is focused on information propagation models, campaign initialization strategies and factors affecting campaign dynamics. In terms of algorithms and performance evaluation, the final coverage represented by the fraction of activated nodes within a target network is usually used. It is not necessarily consistent with the real marketing campaigns using various characteristics and parameters related to coverage, costs, behavioral patterns and time factors for overall evaluation. This paper presents assumptions for a decision support system for multi-criteria campaign planning and evaluation with inputs from agent-based simulations. The results, which are delivered from a simulation model based on synthetic networks in a form of decision scenarios, are verified within a real network. Last, but not least, the study proposes a multi-objective campaign evaluation framework with several campaign evaluation metrics integrated. The results showed that the recommendations generated with the use of synthetic networks applied to real networks delivered results according to the decision makers’ expectation in terms of the used evaluation criteria. Apart from practical applications, the proposed multi-objective approach creates new evaluation possibilities for theoretical studies focused on information spreading processes within complex networks."
https://openalex.org/W2908365581,"Recent studies have shown that autophagy exhibits a renoprotective role in various models of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, its role in vancomycin (Van)-induced AKI remains largely unclarified. This study was the first to indicate that autophagy was rapidly activated in both human kidney-2 cells and renal tissues, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was inactivated via the suppression of ERK1/2 and mTOR during Van treatment. Interestingly, for both in vitro and in vivo experiments, the suppression of autophagy via chloroquine and PT-Atg7-KO significantly ameliorated Van-induced kidney injury and renal tubular cell apoptosis. Global gene expression analysis indicated that the expression levels of 6159 genes were induced by Van treatment in the kidney cortical tissues of PT-Atg7 wild-type mice, and 18 of them were notably suppressed in PT-Atg7-KO mice. These 18 genes were further classified as programmed cell death, protein binding, signal transduction, E3 ubiquitin ligase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity, and E1-like activating enzyme. Unexpectedly, following Van treatment, PKC-δ expression was found to be highest among the 4 genes related to cell death, which was remarkably suppressed in vitro and in PT-Atg7-KO mice. In addition, Atg7 could induce renal cell apoptosis during Van treatment via binding to PKC-δ. Likewise, the inhibition of PKCδ ameliorated Van-induced apoptosis in human kidney-2 cells and kidney tissues. Furthermore, the data showed that PT-Atg7-KO exerted a renoprotective effect against Van-induced nephrotoxicity, but this effect was lost after injection with myc-tagged PKCδ. Taken altogether, these results indicate that Van induces autophagy by suppressing the activation of the ERK1/2 and mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, Atg7 mediates Van-induced AKI through the activation of PKCδ. In sum, autophagy inhibition may serve as a novel therapeutic target for treating nephrotoxic AKI induced by Van.-Xu, X., Pan, J., Li, H., Li, X., Fang, F., Wu, D., Zhou, Y., Zheng, P., Xiong, L., Zhang, D. Atg7 mediates renal tubular cell apoptosis in vancomycin nephrotoxicity through activation of PKC-δ."
https://openalex.org/W2906457918,"Accumulating evidence indicates that a wide range of E3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in the development of many human diseases. Searching for small-molecule modulators of these E3 ubiquitin ligases is emerging as a promising drug discovery strategy. Here, we report the development of a cell-based high-throughput screening method to identify modulators of E3 ubiquitin ligases by integrating the ubiquitin-reference technique (URT), based on a fusion protein of ubiquitin located between a protein of interest and a reference protein moiety, with a Dual-Luciferase system. Using this method, we screened for small-molecule modulators of SMAD ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (SMURF1), which belongs to the NEDD4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and is an attractive therapeutic target because of its roles in tumorigenesis. Using RAS homolog family member B (RHOB) as a SMURF1 substrate in this screen, we identified a potent SMURF1 inhibitor and confirmed that it also blocks SMURF1-dependent degradation of SMAD family member 1 (SMAD1) and RHOA. An in vitro auto-ubiquitination assay indicated that this compound inhibits both SMURF1 and SMURF2 activities, indicating that it may be an antagonist of the catalytic activity of the HECT domain in SMURF1/2. Moreover, cell functional assays revealed that this compound effectively inhibits protrusive activity in HEK293T cells and blocks transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in MDCK cells, similar to the effects on these processes caused by SMURF1 loss. In summary, the screening approach presented here may have great practical potential for identifying modulators of E3 ubiquitin ligases."
https://openalex.org/W2906694638,"Ischemia reperfusion injury is associated with tissue damage and inflammation, and is one of the main factors causing flap failure in reconstructive microsurgery. Although ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a well-studied aspect of flap survival, its biological mechanisms remain to be elucidated. To better understand the biological processes of ischemia reperfusion injury, and to develop further therapeutic strategies, the main objective of this study was to identify the gene expression pattern and histological changes in an I/R injury animal model. Fourteen rats (n = 7/group) were randomly divided into control or ischemia-reperfusion group (8 hours of ischemia). Microsurgical anastomoses were objectively assessed using transit-time-ultrasound technology. Seven days after surgery, flap survival was evaluated and tissue samples were harvested for anatomopathological and gene-expression analyses.The I/R injury reduced the survival of free flaps and histological analyses revealed a subcutaneous edema together with an inflammatory infiltrate. Interestingly, the Arginase 1 expression level as well as the ratio of Arginase 1/Nitric oxide synthase 2 showed a significant increase in the I/R group. In summary, here we describe a well-characterized I/R animal model that may serve to evaluate therapeutic agents under reproducible and controlled conditions. Moreover, this model could be especially useful for the evaluation of arginase inhibitors and different compounds of potential interest in reconstructive microsurgery."
https://openalex.org/W2908196804,"The present study was aimed to develop a liposomal formulation of thymoquinone (Lip-TQ) to treat Candida albicans infection in diabetic mice. Streptozotocin (STZ) was injected to induce hyperglycemia and on day 3 post STZ administration, mice were intravenously infected with C. albicans. Various doses (2, 5 and 10 mg/kg) of Free or Lip-TQ were administered in C. albicans infected diabetic mice. The effect of Lip-TQ was also determined on the organ indices, liver and kidney function parameters. Lip-TQ at a dose of 10 mg/kg significantly reduced the level of the blood glucose and alleviated the systemic C. albicans infection in diabetic mice. C. albicans infected diabetic mice treated with Lip-TQ at a dose of 10 mg/kg showed the survival rate of 70% as compared to that of 20% in the group treated with free TQ. The treatment with Lip-TQ resulted in the recovery of the organ indices, liver inflammation, kidney functioning and pancreas regeneration in diabetic mice. Moreover, TQ formulations also showed the direct therapeutic effect against candidiasis in the untreated or metformin-treated diabetic mice. Therefore, the findings of the present study support the use of Lip-TQ in the treatment of candidiasis in the diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2908238196,"Leprosy remains a major stigmatizing condition. Stigma is a dynamic process resulting from the interaction between physical attributes caused by leprosy and the existing stereotypes in a community. Leprosy has pervasive impacts on all areas of life including psychosocial burden to an individual, social interaction, marriage, and employment. These impacts vary and are largely dependent on a particular culture and community. The main objective of this study was to explore the perceived stigma of leprosy amongst community members and health care providers in Lalitpur district of Nepal.A total of six focused group discussions (FGDs) with 43 participants from a community living close to Anandaban Leprosy Hospital and ten semi structured interviews (SSIs) with health care providers were conducted between October and December 2016. An interview guide was used for the FGDs and SSIs. All qualitative data were transcribed and translated into English and were thematically analyzed using Atlas.ti software.Visible deformities due to leprosy was one of the major contributing factors for stigma. Stigma was further exacerbated by an attitude to conceal the disease due to perceived fear of potential discrimination. While over the years, stigma was felt to be decreasing, various aspects of life were still affected by leprosy stigma including marriage, employment and social interaction. This was largely attributed to leprosy and its consequences, specifically the disability and deformity caused by leprosy.Leprosy was still perceived to be feared and concealed because of potential discrimination, even within the community that was close to a long established leprosy hospital. Various aspects such as marriage, employment and social interaction were still affected by the stigma which was strongly associated with visible deformities. In addition to ongoing rehabilitation and stigma reduction programs, integrating strategies such as community engagement wherein community and leprosy affected person jointly take a role in stigma reduction programs can be helpful."
https://openalex.org/W2907002983,"Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is a wide-spread fungus that is a potent allergen in hypersensitive individuals but also an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients. It reproduces asexually by releasing airborne conidiospores (conidia). Upon inhalation, fungal conidia are capable of reaching the airway epithelial cells (AECs) in bronchial and alveolar tissues. Previous studies have predominantly used submerged monolayer cultures for studying this host-pathogen interaction; however, these cultures do not recapitulate the mucocililary differentiation phenotype of the in vivo epithelium in the respiratory tract. Thus, the aim of this study was to use well-differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) grown at the air-liquid interface (ALI) to determine their transcriptomic and proteomic responses following interaction with A. fumigatus conidia. We visualized conidial interaction with HBECs using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and applied NanoString nCounter and shotgun proteomics to assess gene expression changes in the human cells upon interaction with A. fumigatus conidia. Western blot analysis was used to assess the expression of top three differentially expressed proteins, CALR, SET and NUCB2. CLSM showed that, unlike submerged monolayer cultures, well-differentiated ALI cultures of primary HBECs were estimated to internalize less than 1% of bound conidia. Nevertheless, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed numerous differentially expressed host genes; these were enriched for pathways including apoptosis/autophagy, translation, unfolded protein response and cell cycle (up-regulated); complement and coagulation pathways, iron homeostasis, nonsense mediated decay and rRNA binding (down-regulated). CALR and SET were confirmed to be up-regulated in ALI cultures of primary HBECs upon exposure to A. fumigatus via western blot analysis. Therefore, using transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, ALI models recapitulating the bronchial epithelial barrier in the conductive zone of the respiratory tract can provide novel insights to the molecular response of bronchial epithelial cells upon exposure to A. fumigatus conidia."
https://openalex.org/W2907505736,"In pancreatic β-cells, mitochondria generate signals that promote insulin granule exocytosis. Here we study how lysine acetylation of mitochondrial proteins mechanistically affects metabolism-secretion coupling in insulin-secreting cells. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified lysine acetylation sites in rat insulinoma cell line clone 1E cells. In cells lacking the mitochondrial lysine deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), several matrix proteins are hyperacetylated. Disruption of the SIRT3 gene has a deleterious effect on mitochondrial energy metabolism and Ca2+ signaling. Under resting conditions, SIRT3 deficient cells are overactivated, which elevates the respiratory rate and enhances calcium signaling and basal insulin secretion. In response to glucose, the SIRT3 knockout cells are unable to mount a sustained cytosolic ATP response. Calcium signaling is strongly reduced and the respiratory response as well as insulin secretion are blunted. We propose mitochondrial protein lysine acetylation as a control mechanism in β-cell energy metabolism and Ca2+ signaling.-De Marchi, U., Galindo, A. N., Thevenet, J., Hermant, A., Bermont, F., Lassueur, S., Domingo, J. S., Kussmann, M., Dayon, L., Wiederkehr, A.

Many people are turning to use TM as a complementary or integrative treatment. The aim of this study is to present the first nationwide report describing the use of TM in two countries (South Korea and Taiwan).To present the TM utilization patterns between South Korea and Taiwan, we analyzed data from the National Health Insurance cohorts in each country, each of which has approximately one million inhabitants.In total, 261,478 (25.5%) of 1,025,340 people in South Korea and 260,529 (26.8%) of 970,866 people in Taiwan used TM services at least once under the National Health Insurance in 2011. Using multivariable logistic regression, TM users in South Korea were significantly more likely to be female, 61-80 years of age and individuals with a high income, and those in Taiwan were significantly more likely to be female, 21-40 years of age and individuals with a middle income. The two countries showed similar utilization patterns in visit seasons. People visited TM clinics more frequently than TM hospitals in both countries. The most common TM treatment in South Korea was acupuncture, whereas in Taiwan, various powdered Chinese herbal preparations were the most commonly used treatment. The most common diseases for people seeking TM services were musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases in South Korea and Symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions in Taiwan.According to the National Health Insurance database, about one fourth of the NHI beneficiaries of South Korea and Taiwan had TM use in 2011. Different TM utilization patterns existed between South Korea and Taiwan, which might be due to the differences in insurance coverage between the two countries."

Despite the significance of estrogen hormones for regulation of glucose metabolism, little is known about the roles of endogenous estrogen metabolites in modulating pancreatic β-cell function. In this study, we evaluated the effects of major natural estrogen metabolites, catechol estrogens, on insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. We show that catechol estrogens, hydroxylated at positions C2 and C4 of the steroid A ring, rapidly potentiated glucose-induced insulin secretion via a nongenomic mechanism. 2-Hydroxyestrone, the most abundant endogenous estrogen metabolite, was more efficacious in stimulating insulin secretion than any other tested catechol estrogens. In insulin-secreting cells, catechol estrogens produced rapid activation of calcium influx and elevation in cytosolic free calcium. Catechol estrogens also generated sustained elevations in cytosolic free calcium and evoked inward ion current in HEK293 cells expressing the transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1) cation channel. Calcium influx and insulin secretion stimulated by estrogen metabolites were dependent on the TRPA1 activity and inhibited with the channel-specific pharmacological antagonists or the siRNA. Our results suggest the role of estrogen metabolism in a direct regulation of TRPA1 activity with potential implications for metabolic diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2908411370,"O-GlcNAcylation is a post-translational modification of a protein serine or threonine residue catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) in the nucleus and cytoplasm. O-GlcNAcylation plays important roles in the cellular signaling that affect the different biological functions of cells, depending upon cell type. However, whether or not O-GlcNAcylation regulates cell adhesion and migration remains unclear. Here, we used the doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) system to establish an OGT knockdown (KD) HeLa cell line and found that O-GlcNAcylation is a key regulator for cell adhesion, migration, and focal adhesion (FA) complex formation. The expression levels of OGT and O-GlcNAcylation were remarkably suppressed 24 h after induction of doxycycline. Knockdown of OGT significantly promoted cell adhesion, but it suppressed the cell migration on fibronectin. The immunostaining with paxillin, a marker for FA plaque, clearly showed that the number of FAs was increased in the KD cells compared with that in the control cells. The O-GlcNAcylation levels of paxillin, talin, and focal adhesion kinase were down-regulated in KD cells. Interestingly, the complex formation between integrin β1, focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and talin was greatly increased in KD cells. Consistently, levels of active integrin β1 were significantly enhanced in KD cells, whereas they were decreased in cells overexpressing OGT.

On the other hand, the suppression of OGT expression in breast or liver cancer cell lines decreases cell motility, which suggests that O-GlcNAcylation could be involved in cell migration (10Gu Y.

Cell migration is a highly integrated multistep process that includes the development of cytoplasmic protrusions, attachment, and spreading (16Franz C.M. Jones G.E. Ridley A.J. Cell migration in development and disease.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2 (11832241): 153-15810.1016/S1534-5807(02)00120-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The migratory capacity of cancer cells is initially mediated by alterations in the expression of cell surface molecules known as integrins (17Hood J.D. Cheresh D.A.

It is becoming increasingly clear that integrins are crucial for cell migration in the tumor microenvironment (18Guo W. Giancotti F.G. Integrin signalling during tumour progression.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5 (15459662): 816-82610.1038/nrm1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Following ligand binding, integrins cluster into focal contacts that contain different focal adhesion (FA)-associated proteins, such as α-actinin, vinculin, talin, FAK, and paxillin, which link the integrins to the actin cytoskeleton (19Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Schwartz M.A. Cell adhesion: integrating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular tension.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 (20729930): 633-64310.1038/nrm2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). The processes of adhesion formation and disassembly drive the migration cycle through ligand binding, which in turn regulates integrin activity and cytoskeletal complex formation as well as adhesion dynamics (20Webb D.J. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Adhesion assembly, disassembly and turnover in migrating cells: over and over and over again.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4 (11944043): E97-E10010.1038/ncb0402-e97Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAcylation appears to occur in actin cytoskeletal regulatory proteins, such as paxillin (21Kwak T.K. Kim H. Jung O. Lee S.A. Kang M. Kim H.J. Park J.M. Kim S.H. Lee J.W.

The cytoskeletal protein talin is O-glycosylated.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (1629228): 14424-14428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in microtubule assembly proteins, such as tubulin (23Ji S. Kang J.G. Park S.Y. Lee J. Oh Y.J. Cho J.W. O-GlcNAcylation of tubulin inhibits its polymerization.Amino Acids. 2011; 40 (20665223): 809-81810.1007/s00726-010-0698-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and in microtubule-associated proteins (24Ding M. Vandré D.D. High molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins contain O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine.J. Biol.

However, whether and how O-GlcNAcylation impacts cell migration remains unclear. In the present study, we used the doxycycline shRNA-inducible system to knock down the OGT gene to identify the biological functions of O-GlcNAcylation and its regulatory mechanisms in cell adhesion and migration. We found that the knockdown of OGT aberrantly increased cell adhesion, FA formation, and integrin β1 activation, which in turn decreased cell migration. Thus, our findings may provide new insight into integrin-mediated cell migration and explain why O-GlcNAcylation is usually highly expressed in some malignant cancers. A growing number of studies have shown that O-GlcNAcylation plays a critical role in the regulation of tumor cell growth (11Caldwell S.A. Jackson S.R. Shahriari K.S. Lynch T.P. Sethi G. Walker S. Vosseller K. Reginato M.J.

To investigate the effects of O-GlcNAc expression on cell adhesion and migration, we used the DOX-dependent inducible shRNA KD system to establish OGT KD HeLa cells. In this cellular system, OGT and O-GlcNAc were expressed at normal levels in the absence of DOX, whereas both expressions were drastically suppressed in the presence of DOX in the culture medium at the indicated concentrations, as shown in Fig. 1A. Furthermore, similar suppression levels were observed even following incubation at the lowest concentration of 0.1 μg/ml after 24 h (Fig. 1B), suggesting an effective KD of OGT and a rapid turnover of O-GlcNAc levels in HeLa cells. After culture for 48 h, elongated cell shapes were converted to a more-rounded morphology, and the KD cells showed significantly increased cell spreading areas compared with those in the control cells (Fig. 1C). These observations suggest the impact that O-GlcNAcylation exerts on cell morphology. Next, we used a fibronectin (FN)-coated dish to investigate the effects of OGT KD on cell adhesion, FA formation, and cell motility. To verify the initial stage of cell adhesion, we performed a 20-min cell adhesion assay on FN. Interestingly, the number of adhered cells was drastically increased in the KD cells compared with that in the control cells (Fig. 2A). During cell adhesion, integrins and cytoplasmic proteins such as paxillin, talin, and FAK become clustered in the plane of the cell membrane and in well-developed aggregates, the so-called FA plaque, which can be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy (27Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Integrin signaling.Science. 1999; 285 (10446041): 1028-103210.1126/science.285.5430.1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (3814) Google Scholar). Consistent with their enhancement of cell adhesion, in the present study, OGT KD cells also promoted an increase in FA formation, by comparison with the activity in control cells (Fig. 2B). By contrast, the KD cells showed a significant reduction in cell motility, as observed by video microscopy (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that a loss of O-GlcNAcylation promotes cell adhesion and focal contact formation while suppressing cell migration. Previous studies have revealed that some forms of protein FA plaque, such as paxillin and talin, are modified by O-GlcNAc (21Kwak T.K. Kim H. Jung O. Lee S.A. Kang M. Kim H.J. Park J.M. Kim S.H. Lee J.W. Glucosamine treatment-mediated O-GlcNAc modification of paxillin depends on adhesion state of rat insulinoma INS-1 cells.J. Biol.

The cytoskeletal protein talin is O-glycosylated.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (1629228): 14424-14428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated whether O-GlcNAc modification of those target proteins also occurred in HeLa cells in this system. Consistent with previous studies, O-GlcNAc modifications were detected on both paxillin and talin, whereas O-GlcNAcylation levels for both proteins were significantly decreased in KD cells, compared with that seen in control cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Importantly, we also found that FAK, a key molecule for integrin-mediated signaling, was also a target protein for O-GlcNAcylation, which was decreased in the KD cells (Fig. 3C). The suppression of O-GlcNAcylation on FAK and talin was also confirmed in DOX-induced OGT KD 293T cells (data not shown). To further establish the occurrence of O-GlcNAcylation in these proteins, we conducted a chemoenzymatic labeling assay using an azido-GalNAc sugar, as described under “Experimental procedures.” Clearly, talin, FAK, and paxillin were labeled, which proved that they are O-GlcNAcylated proteins (Fig. 4, A–C). These results suggest that O-GlcNAcylation may affect both integrin β1–mediated complex formation and FA formation, which confirms this process as a regulator of cell adhesion and migration.Figure 4.Confirmation of O-GlcNAcylation on talin, FAK, and paxillin. Cell lysates of 293T cells transfected with talin (A), FAK (B), or WT HeLa cells (C) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-GFP, anti-VSV, or anti-paxillin antibodies, respectively, followed by click chemistry labeling of O-GlcNAc residues with (+) or without (−) GalT and UDP-GalNAz, and were detected using an ABC kit, as described under “Experimental procedures.” Experiments were independently repeated at least two times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FAK is a key component of the signal transduction pathways triggered by integrins. When cells bind to the extracellular matrix (ECM), FAK is usually recruited to integrin-mediated nascent FA, because it interacts directly through the cytoskeletal proteins talin and paxillin, with the cytoplasmic tail of integrin β1 (28Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T. Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Guan J.L. Interaction of focal adhesion kinase with cytoskeletal protein talin.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (7622520): 16995-1699910.1074/jbc.270.28.16995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the ability of control and KD cells to form FA complexes. As shown in Fig. 5A, the complexes immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibody showed higher levels of paxillin in KD cells than in control cells. Consistently, KD cells demonstrated a greater number of complex formations composed of both β1 integrin and talin (Fig. 5B) and talin and FAK (Fig. 5C). A similar phenomenon was also confirmed in OGT-KD 293T cells (data not shown). Given the increase in FA complex formation in KD cells, it is reasonable to speculate that OGT-KD may affect integrin activation. Integrin-mediated adhesion can recruit FA proteins to form FA plaque and then trigger conformational activation, so-called inside-out signaling, of integrin β1 in the ectodomain, which then can be recognized by a specific antibody (29Valdembri D. Serini G. Regulation of adhesion site dynamics by integrin traffic.Curr. Opin.

The expression levels of active β1 in immunostaining (Fig. 6A) or cell lysates (Fig. 6B) were clearly up-regulated in the KD cells compared with control cells. In contrast to KD cells, the expression levels of active β1 were suppressed in the OGT-overexpressing HeLa cells, which further suggested that O-GlcNAcylation negatively regulates integrin-mediated inside-out signaling. Thus, we were convinced that OGT could be a novel regulator for FA complex formation and integrin activation by dynamically regulating cell adhesion and migration. In the present study, we clearly showed that O-GlcNAcylation negatively regulates integrin-mediated cell adhesion and FA complex formation as well as integrin activation, which results in the control of cell migration on the ECM (Fig. 7). Our findings are the first to demonstrate that OGT may function as a key regulator of FA complex formation during cell–ECM adhesion. These results provide clues to understanding the roles of O-GlcNAcylation in cell migration. Cell migration is a central process in the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms (16Franz C.M. Jones G.E. Ridley A.J. Cell migration in development and disease.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2 (11832241): 153-15810.1016/S1534-5807(02)00120-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although the detailed mechanisms underlying cell migration remain unclear, it is reasonable to postulate that integrin-mediated cell adhesion could regulate migration, which would allow communication between cell–ECM contact and the actin cytoskeleton through focal adhesions (31Collins C. Nelson W.J. Running with neighbors: coordinating cell migration and cell-cell adhesion.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2015; 36 (26201843): 62-7010.1016/j.ceb.2015.07.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The dynamic balance between adhesion receptors and the binding of ECM ligands provides FA turnover that regulates adhesion formation and disassembly (32Wolfram T. Spatz J.P. Burgess R.W. Cell adhesion to agrin presented as a nanopatterned substrate is consistent with an interaction with the extracellular matrix and not transmembrane adhesion molecules.BMC Cell Biol. 2008; 9 (19055842): 6410.1186/1471-2121-9-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the framework of this model, an imbalance in the processes of attachment and detachment leads to conformational changes that mediate abnormal adhesion (19Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Schwartz M.A. Cell adhesion: integrating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular tension.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 (20729930): 633-64310.1038/nrm2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). In the present study, we clearly demonstrated that the suppression of O-GlcNAcylation inhibited HeLa cell migration, whereas it enhanced cell–ECM adhesion (Fig. 2), which indicated that O-GlcNAcylation is involved in the regulation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Consistently, FAK serves as a key regulator of FA assembly and disassembly processes that are fundamental for efficient cell migration (33Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Focal adhesion kinase: a regulator of focal adhesion dynamics and cell movement.Oncogene. 2000; 19 (11114741): 5606-561310.1038/sj.onc.1203877Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Indeed, there were more stress fibers and focal adhesions in FAK-deficient cells, whereas cell motility was inhibited (34Ilić D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Reduced cell motility and enhanced focal adhesion contact formation in cells from FAK-deficient mice.Nature. 1995; 377 (7566154): 539-54410.1038/377539a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Aberrant cell–ECM adhesiveness is likely to suppress cell migration, and proper cell adhesion is an important determinant for cell migration (35Hang Q. Isaji T. Hou S. Wang Y. Fukuda T. Gu J. A key regulator of cell adhesion: identification and characterization of important N-glycosylation sites on integrin α5 for cell migration.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2017; 37 (28167607): e00516-e0055810.1128/MCB.00558-16Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, our data are reasonable in that the knockdown of O-GlcNAcylation aberrantly increased cell adhesion, as well as spreading and FA complex formation, which in turn decreased cell migration. Consistently, a loss of paxillin phosphorylation at Ser-250 markedly inhibits focal adhesion turnover and cell migration (36Quizi J.L. Baron K. Al-Zahrani K.N. O'Reilly P. Sriram R.K. Conway J. Laurin A.A. Sabourin L.A. SLK-mediated phosphorylation of paxillin is required for focal adhesion turnover and cell migration.Oncogene. 2013; 32 (23128389): 4656-466310.1038/onc.2012.488Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We were intrigued as to why a knockdown of OGT would enhance integrin activation. Integrins are the major cell surface receptors used to assemble and recognize a functional ECM and to facilitate cell signaling and migration (37Anthis N.J. Campbell I.D. The tail of integrin activation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36 (21216149): 191-19810.1016/j.tibs.2010.11.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The organization of cell adhesions is complex and includes a number of cytoplasmic proteins, such as paxillin, talin, FAK, vinculin, and α-actinin (29Valdembri D. Serini G. Regulation of adhesion site dynamics by integrin traffic.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2012; 24 (22981739): 582-59110.1016/j.ceb.2012.08.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Integrin activation is associated with an array of biological and pathological conditions involving both outside-in and inside-out signaling (38Wolfenson H. Lavelin I. Geiger B. Dynamic regulation of the structure and functions of integrin adhesions.Dev. Cell. 2013; 24 (23484852): 447-45810.1016/j.devcel.2013.02.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Accumulating data have indicated that the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β1 subunit cooperatively promotes integrin activation through the binding of talin (39Shattil S.J. Kim C. Ginsberg M.H. The final steps of integrin activation: the end game.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 (20308986): 288-30010.1038/nrm2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Consequently, our results clearly showed the interaction of integrin β1 with talin, and the association of FAK, paxillin, and/or talin both were greatly increased in the KD cells, which suggests that the KD of OGT promotes inside-out signaling (Fig. 5). A reciprocal relationship between O-GlcNAcylation and O-phosphorylation has been observed in the specific serine or threonine residue of particular proteins (40Comer F.I. Hart G.W. O-Glycosylation of nuclear and cytosolic proteins: dynamic interplay between O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate.J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2017; 18 (28488703): 452-46510.1038/nrm.2017.22Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and, therefore, how O-GlcNAcylation affects the O-phosphorylation of FA complex proteins is worthy of clarification. The O-GlcNAcylation of FAK is noteworthy. Integrins do not possess enzymatic activity; rather, they associate with a number of cytoplasmic protein kinases, such as FAK and Src. Tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK is well-known to be a promoter of interactions with various Src homology 2– and 3–containing proteins and to initiate enzymatic cascades via these associated kinases that ultimately lead to changes in cell behavior (42Mitra S.K. Hanson D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Focal adhesion kinase: in command and control of cell motility.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6 (15688067): 56-6810.1038/nrm1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). By contrast, serine or threonine phosphorylation on FAK is not well-understood. FAK phosphorylation at either Ser-732 or Ser-722 has recently been recognized as important for microtubule organization, nuclear movement, and neuronal migration during cell adhesion (43Xie Z. Sanada K. Samuels B.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Serine 732 phosphorylation of FAK by Cdk5 is important for microtubule organization, nuclear movement, and neuronal migration.Cell. 2003; 114 (12941275): 469-48210.1016/S0092-8674(03)00605-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 44Bianchi M.

In the present study, a total of 56 putative WRKY genes were identified in melon, which were randomly distributed on their respective chromosomes. A multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis using melon, cucumber and watermelon predicted WRKY domains indicated that melon WRKY proteins could be classified into three main groups (I-III). Our analysis indicated that no recent duplication events of WRKY genes were detected in melon, and strong purifying selection was observed among the 85 orthologous pairs of Cucurbitaceae species. Expression profiles of CmWRKY derived from RNA-seq data and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses showed distinct expression patterns in various tissues, and the expression of 16 CmWRKY were altered following powdery mildew infection in melon. Besides, we also found that a total of 24 WRKY genes were co-expressed with 11 VQ family genes in melon. Our comparative genomic analysis provides a foundation for future functional dissection and understanding the evolution of WRKY genes in cucurbitaceae species, and will promote powdery mildew resistance study in melon."
https://openalex.org/W2907177031,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) contacts are dynamic structures with important roles in the regulation of calcium (Ca2+) and lipid homeostasis. The extended synaptotagmins (E-Syts) are ER-localized lipid transport proteins that interact with PM phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in a Ca2+-dependent manner. E-Syts bidirectionally transfer glycerolipids, including diacylglycerol (DAG), between the 2 juxtaposed membranes, but the biologic significance of this transport is still unclear. Using insulin-secreting cells and live-cell imaging, we now show that Ca2+-triggered exocytosis of insulin granules is followed, in sequence, by PM DAG formation and E-Syt1 recruitment. E-Syt1 counteracted the depolarization-induced DAG formation through a mechanism that required both voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release from the ER. E-Syt1 knockdown resulted in prolonged accumulation of DAG in the PM, resulting in increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We conclude that Ca2+-triggered exocytosis is temporally coupled to Ca2+-triggered E-Syt1 PM recruitment and removal of DAG to negatively regulate the same process.-Xie, B., Nguyen, P.

https://openalex.org/W2906528689,"Neuroendocrine-type ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels are metabolite sensors coupling membrane potential with metabolism, thereby linking insulin secretion to plasma glucose levels. They are octameric complexes, (SUR1/Kir6.2)4, comprising sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1 or ABCC8) and a K+-selective inward rectifier (Kir6.2 or KCNJ11). Interactions between nucleotide-, agonist-, and antagonist-binding sites affect channel activity allosterically. Although it is hypothesized that opening these channels requires SUR1-mediated MgATP hydrolysis, we show here that ATP binding to SUR1, without hydrolysis, opens channels when nucleotide antagonism on Kir6.2 is minimized and SUR1 mutants with increased ATP affinities are used. We found that ATP binding is sufficient to switch SUR1 alone between inward- or outward-facing conformations with low or high dissociation constant, KD, values for the conformation-sensitive channel antagonist [3H]glibenclamide ([3H]GBM), indicating that ATP can act as a pure agonist. Assembly with Kir6.2 reduced SUR1's KD for [3H]GBM. This reduction required the Kir N terminus (KNtp), consistent with KNtp occupying a “transport cavity,” thus positioning it to link ATP-induced SUR1 conformational changes to channel gating. Moreover, ATP/GBM site coupling was constrained in WT SUR1/WT Kir6.2 channels; ATP-bound channels had a lower KD for [3H]GBM than ATP-bound SUR1. This constraint was largely eliminated by the Q1179R neonatal diabetes-associated mutation in helix 15, suggesting that a “swapped” helix pair, 15 and 16, is part of a structural pathway connecting the ATP/GBM sites. Our results suggest that ATP binding to SUR1 biases KATP channels toward open states, consistent with SUR1 variants with lower KD values causing neonatal diabetes, whereas increased KD values cause congenital hyperinsulinism. Neuroendocrine-type ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels are metabolite sensors coupling membrane potential with metabolism, thereby linking insulin secretion to plasma glucose levels. They are octameric complexes, (SUR1/Kir6.2)4, comprising sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1 or ABCC8) and a K+-selective inward rectifier (Kir6.2 or KCNJ11). Interactions between nucleotide-, agonist-, and antagonist-binding sites affect channel activity allosterically. Although it is hypothesized that opening these channels requires SUR1-mediated MgATP hydrolysis, we show here that ATP binding to SUR1, without hydrolysis, opens channels when nucleotide antagonism on Kir6.2 is minimized and SUR1 mutants with increased ATP affinities are used. We found that ATP binding is sufficient to switch SUR1 alone between inward- or outward-facing conformations with low or high dissociation constant, KD, values for the conformation-sensitive channel antagonist [3H]glibenclamide ([3H]GBM), indicating that ATP can act as a pure agonist. Assembly with Kir6.2 reduced SUR1's KD for [3H]GBM.

https://openalex.org/W2907972922,"Background The chronic remitting and relapsing intestinal inflammation characteristic of Crohn’s disease frequently leads to fibrosis and subsequent stenosis of the inflamed region. Approximately a third of all Crohn’s disease patients require resection at some stage in their disease course. As the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease associated fibrosis is largely unknown, a strong necessity exists to better understand the pathophysiology thereof. Methods In this study, we investigated changes of the DNA methylome and transcriptome of ileum-derived fibroblasts associated to the occurrence of Crohn’s disease associated fibrosis. Eighteen samples were included in a DNA methylation array and twenty-one samples were used for RNA sequencing. Results Most differentially methylated regions and differentially expressed genes were observed when comparing stenotic with non-inflamed samples. By contrast, few differences were observed when comparing Crohn’s disease with non-Crohn’s disease, or inflamed with non-inflamed tissue. Integrative methylation and gene expression analyses revealed dysregulation of genes associated to the PRKACA and E2F1 network, which is involved in cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and bile metabolism. Conclusion Our research provides evidence that the methylome and the transcriptome are systematically dysregulated in stenosis-associated fibroblasts."

CRLs are activated by the attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8 (NEDD8) to the cullin subunits. This cullin neddylation is essential for a plethora of CRL-regulated cellular processes and is vital for life. In mammals, neddylation is promoted by the five co-E3 ligases, defective in cullin neddylation 1 domain-containing 1–5 (DCNL1–5); however, their functional regulation within the CRL complex remains elusive. We found here that the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain–containing DCNL1 is monoubiquitylated when bound to CRLs and that this monoubiquitylation depends on the CRL-associated Ariadne RBR ligases TRIAD1 (ARIH2) and HHARI (ARIH1) and strictly requires the DCNL1's UBA domain. Reconstitution of DCNL1 monoubiquitylation in vitro revealed that autoubiquitylated TRIAD1 mediates binding to the UBA domain and subsequently promotes a single ubiquitin attachment to DCNL1 in a mechanism previously dubbed coupled monoubiquitylation. Moreover, we provide evidence that DCNL1 monoubiquitylation is required for efficient CRL activity, most likely by remodeling CRLs and their substrate receptors. Collectively, this work identifies DCNL1 as a critical target of Ariadne RBR ligases and coupled monoubiquitylation of DCNL1 as an integrated mechanism that affects CRL activity and client–substrate ubiquitylation at multiple levels.

https://openalex.org/W2907633818,"Snow is important for local to global climate and surface hydrology, but spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the extent of snow cover make accurate, fine-scale mapping and monitoring of snow an enormous challenge. We took 184,453 daily near-surface images acquired by 133 automated cameras and processed them using crowdsourcing and deep learning to determine whether snow was present or absent in each image. We found that the crowdsourced data had an accuracy of 99.1% when compared with expert evaluation of the same imagery. We then used the image classification to train a deep convolutional neural network via transfer learning, with accuracies of 92% to 98%, depending on the image set and training method. The majority of neural network errors were due to snow that was present not being detected. We used the results of the neural networks to validate the presence or absence of snow inferred from the MODIS satellite sensor and obtained similar results to those from other validation studies. This method of using automated sensors, crowdsourcing, and deep learning in combination produced an accurate high temporal dataset of snow presence across a continent. It holds broad potential for real-time large-scale acquisition and processing of ecological and environmental data in support of monitoring, management, and research objectives."

Yet, such databases are scarce in comparison to others portraying adult models, and validation procedures are typically restricted to emotional recognition accuracy. This work presents subjective ratings for a sub-set of 283 photographs selected from the Child Affective Facial Expression set (CAFE [1]). Extending beyond the original emotion recognition accuracy norms [2], our main goal was to validate this database across eight subjective dimensions related to the model (e.g., attractiveness, familiarity) or the specific facial expression (e.g., intensity, genuineness), using a sample from a different nationality (N = 450 Portuguese participants). We also assessed emotion recognition (forced-choice task with seven options: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and neutral). Overall results show that most photographs were rated as highly clear, genuine and intense facial expressions. The models were rated as both moderately familiar and likely to belong to the in-group, obtaining high attractiveness and arousal ratings. Results also showed that, similarly to the original study, the facial expressions were accurately recognized. Normative and raw data are available as supplementary material at https://osf.io/mjqfx/."

We conducted a qualitative analysis to identify sources of disagreements on an annotation experiment which used a subset of SNOMED CT with some restrictions. A corpus of 20 English clinical text fragments from diverse origins and languages was annotated independently by two domain medically trained annotators following a specific annotation guideline. By following this guideline, the annotators had to assign sets of SNOMED CT codes to noun phrases, together with concept and term coverage ratings. Then, the annotations were manually examined against a reference standard to determine sources of disagreements. Five categories were identified. In our results, the most frequent cause of inter-annotator disagreement was related to human issues. In several cases disagreements revealed gaps in the annotation guidelines and lack of training of annotators. The reminder issues can be influenced by some SNOMED CT features."
https://openalex.org/W2908298188,"Rest contributes a large part of animals' daily life, and animals usually rest in two ways, standing or in recumbence. Small or medium sized ungulates bed to rest in most cases, and standing rest is very rare and hardly seen. Here we described a standing rest behavior of Tibetan antelopes (Pantholops hodgsonii) living on the Tibet Plateau which has not been reported before. We named the standing rest behavior Puppet behavior, since the antelope stand still for a certain time. Of the 304 individuals observed, 48.3% (98/203) of adult and sub-adult males expressed the Puppet behavior, whereas only 6.3% (6/96) of females did, indicating an obvious sexual difference. Puppet behavior occurred more frequently at noon and in the afternoon on sunny and cloudy days, meaning that daytime and weather were both influential factors. Puppet behavior was usually accompanied with rumination and sometimes ended with leg-shaking. Our results suggest that Puppet behavior may be an adaptive form of rest, which may serve a thermoregulatory and anti-predation function, and may be simpler and safer than recumbent rest."
https://openalex.org/W2907598743,"Within this paper we explore the idea of a critical value representing the proportion of majority members within a group that affects dramatic changes in influence targets’ conformity. We consider the threshold q-voter model when the responses of the Willis-Nail model, a well-established two-dimensional model of social response, are used as a foundation. Specifically, we study a generalized threshold q-voter model when all basic types of social response described by Willis-Nail model are considered, i.e. conformity, anticonformity, independence, and uniformity/congruence. These responses occur in our model with complementary probabilities. We introduce independently two thresholds: one needed for conformity, as well as a second one for anticonformity. In the case of conformity, at least r individuals among q neighbors have to share the same opinion in order to persuade a voter to follow majority’s opinion, whereas in the case of anticonformity, at least w individuals among q neighbors have to share the same opinion in order to influence voters to take an opinion that goes against that of their own reference group. We solve the model on a complete graph and show that the threshold for conformity significantly influences the results. For example, there is a critical threshold for conformity above which the system behaves as in the case of unanimity, i.e. displays continuous and discontinuous phase transitions. On the other hand, the threshold for anticonformity is almost irrelevant. We discuss our results from the perspective of theories of social psychology, as well as the philosophy of agent-based modeling."

A further picture emerging from these studies is that regulation of DAT function occurs through integration of multiple post-translational inputs. For example, transport kinetic capacity is established by reciprocal phosphorylation of Ser-7 and palmitoylation of Cys-580 (18Moritz A.E. Rastedt D.E. Stanislowski D.J. Shetty M. Smith M.A. Vaughan R.A. Foster J.D. Reciprocal phosphorylation and palmitoylation control dopamine transporter kinetics.J. Biol.

Interaction of these effects could occur at the level of the enzyme pathways for phosphorylation (kinases and phosphatases) and palmitoylation (protein acyltransferases and acyl protein thioesterases) (19Rastedt D.E. Vaughan R.A. Foster J.D. Palmitoylation mechanisms in dopamine transporter regulation.J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2017; 83 (28115272): 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which could be regulated by distinct signaling cascades. Alternatively, modification status could be regulated through accessibility of the sites, which may be affected by transporter activity, interactome alterations, or N-terminal conformation. Identification of enzymes that catalyze modification of these sites and determining how they are regulated or have access to DAT domains is thus crucial for elucidating DAT regulatory mechanisms. Reversible protein phosphorylation is mediated by coordinated control of protein kinases and protein phosphatases (PPs). Most studies on DAT regulation by phosphorylation have focused on kinase inputs, with less known regarding dephosphorylation mechanisms. It has previously been shown that okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of PP1/2A, down-regulates DAT activity and increases DAT phosphorylation level by reducing dephosphorylation (8Gorentla B.K.

Interactions between DAT and PP2Ac in the rat caudate putamen were increased by cocaine self-administration followed by 3 weeks of abstinence (23Samuvel D.J. Jayanthi L.D. Manohar S. Kaliyaperumal K.

However, the phosphorylation sites regulated by these enzymes remain unknown. To investigate these issues, we aimed at identifying DAT-associated protein phosphatases and characterize their respective phosphorylation sites. Here, we demonstrate that PP1 and PP2A were complexed with both mouse striatal DAT (mDAT) and heterologously expressed human DAT (hDAT) and that pharmacological inhibition of PP1/2A increased phosphorylation of hDAT at Thr-48, a previously unknown DAT phosphorylation site. Functional analysis of this site via site-directed mutagenesis revealed a role for its involvement in DA uptake and reciprocal palmitoylation events in hDAT. To screen for DAT association with PPs, we applied co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) followed by LC-coupled tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to confirm the association between DAT and PP2Ac, as well as to screen for association of any other protein phosphatases with DAT. DAT protein complexes were isolated from striatal synaptosomes prepared from WT and DAT−/− knockout (KO) mice by immunoprecipitation with anti-DAT antibody. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE with colloidal blue staining. Each lane was excised and divided into 12 pieces each for in-gel tryptic digestion, and the resulting tryptic peptides were subjected to LC-MS/MS. Specific associations were determined by comparison of proteins from the WT and KO samples (Fig. 1A). MS identified 39 representative DAT peptides in the immunopurified protein complex from the WT mouse striatum, which covered 34.89% of the mouse DAT sequence (Fig. 1B and Table S1). In the same protein complex from the WT striatum, MS identified three peptides for PP1 α, β, and/or γ catalytic subunits (Table 1). In addition, PP2A regulatory subunits A and B as well as PP2A catalytic subunit α/β were identified as co-immunoprecipitated proteins with DAT exclusively in the WT striatum (Table 1 and Fig. 1 (C–E)). The association between DAT and PP2A regulatory subunit Aα was confirmed by co-IP coupled with immunoblotting for mouse striata and HEK293 cells stably expressing YFP-tagged hDAT (YhDAT-HEK cells) (Fig. 2). Immunoreactivities of PP2A regulatory subunit Aα were observed in immunopurified DAT complexes from WT striata and YhDAT-HEK cells but not KO mouse striata and parent HEK293 cells, which do not express DAT (Fig. 2). PP1α catalytic subunit was also co-purified with DAT in YhDAT-HEK cells (Fig. 2B). MS identified co-purified PP2B with 24 peptides in the mouse WT striata, but parallel MS analysis also detected five peptides in the KO mouse striata (Table S2). Moreover, this association was not verified in a heterologous cell system examined in parallel (Fig. S1), and thus, we excluded this protein for further studies.Table 1Identification of PP1 and PP2A in mouse DAT complex by MSMascot ions scoreaThe ions score for an MS/MS match is based on the calculated probability, p, that the observed match between the experimental data and the database sequence is a random event.

Open table in a new tab We detected phosphorylation of DAT residue Thr-53 in the mouse striatum by LC-MS/MS (Fig. S2), confirming previous findings obtained by immunoblotting with a Thr-53–phosphospecific antibody (16Foster J.D.

However, because this identification could not provide any evidence for PP1/2A-responsive phosphorylation sites, we stably expressed hDAT in LLC-PK1 cells in the presence or absence of a PP1/2A inhibitor OA to determine which phosphorylation sites were affected. After immunopurification of hDAT from cell lysates, we repeated the MS analyses as applied for mouse DAT proteins. MS identified DAT from three different gel regions (Fig. 3, A and B), which corresponded to three immunoreactive YFP-DAT bands (Fig. 2B, left). MS identified a few phosphopeptides in hDAT under basal conditions, but treatment with various concentrations of OA increased the MS identification rate for hDAT phosphopeptides, especially the sequence 36EQNGVQLTSSTLTNPR51 (Table 2). We manually confirmed these phosphopeptides with a peak representing neutral loss of phosphoric acid, a signature of phosphopeptides, in MS/MS spectra. This tryptic peptide contains two serine (Ser-44 and -45) and three threonine (Thr-43, -46, and -48) residues that could represent potential phosphoacceptor sites, and the Mascot database search also indicated probabilities for phosphorylation at Ser-45, Thr-46, or Thr-48.Table 2Increased number of phosphopeptides containing Thr-48 by inhibition of PP1/2APeptide sequenceNo treatmentOkadaic acidhDAT WT (LLC-PK1)28EVELILVKEQNGVQLTSSTLTNPR510:19aThe values in boldface type denote the sum of the two different recovered phosphopeptide sequences displayed in the second column versus the sum of the two corresponding unphosphorylated peptides recovered in three individual experiments using three different concentrations of OA.2:11 (0.25 μm, 2 h)36EQNGVQLTSSTLTNPR510:2811:29 (0.5 μm, 2 h)3:386:12 (1.0 μm, 2 h)a The values in boldface type denote the sum of the two different recovered phosphopeptide sequences displayed in the second column versus the sum of the two corresponding unphosphorylated peptides recovered in three individual experiments using three different concentrations of OA. Open table in a new tab To determine the identity of the phosphorylation site, we mutated Thr-48 to Ala to prevent phosphorylation and expressed the T48A hDAT mutant in heterologous cells under OA treatment. MS analysis showed no phosphorylation of this peptide in either basal or OA-stimulated conditions (Tables S3 and S4). Therefore, we concluded that Thr-48 is a PP1/2A-responsive phosphorylation site in hDAT (Fig. 3C). As an additional control, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of this peptide derived from rDAT, which contains isoleucine rather than threonine at position 48 (Fig. S3), although several other Ser and Thr residues are present in this sequence. The resulting tryptic peptide also showed no phosphorylation, providing further support for the specific regulation of Thr-48 phosphorylation status by PP1/2A inhibition. OA-inhibited hDAT dephosphorylation was indicated by the increased number of phosphopeptides isolated (Table 2). To determine the relative increase in Thr-48 phosphorylation mediated by OA, we applied “stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture” (SILAC), which distinguishes peptides derived from different conditions by the stable isotope-introduced mass tag (24Ong S.E. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Kristensen D.B. Steen H. Pandey A. Mann M. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, SILAC, as a simple and accurate approach to expression proteomics.Mol.

The LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing hDAT were cultured in media containing either Lys-0/Arg-0 (“Light”) or Lys-6/Arg-10 (“Heavy”) in the presence or absence of OA (0.5 μm for 1 h). Because the doubly charged (2+)-peptide 36EQNGVQLTSSTLTNPR51 contains one Arg and Lys-6/Arg-10 labeling would increase its mass by 5 Da (m/z = 10 Da/2+), we could compare the identified phosphopeptide peak with the peak that is located at +5 or −5 Da according to the labeling of the identified phosphopeptides. SILAC certainly indicated increased levels of phosphopeptide for Thr-48 in the presence of OA (Fig. 4A, left and middle). When treated with OA in both Light and Heavy culture media, MS identified comparable phosphopeptides for Thr-48 in the Light- and Heavy-labeled DAT at a different m/z of 5 Da (Fig. 4A, right). However, the increase of tryptic peptide peaks by OA was not observed in the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide 36EQNGVQLTSSTLTNPR51 (Fig. 4B) and the hDAT 591LAYAIAPEKDR601 peptide (Fig. 4C). To investigate the functional effect of Thr-48 dephosphorylation, we examined DA uptake mediated by the dephosphomimetic T48A mutant. The construct was transiently expressed in LLC-PK1 cells and showed plasma membrane expression comparable with that of the WT DAT by surface biotinylation analysis (p > 0.05; Fig. 5A). To validate that our cell surface analysis was within the linear range of detection and not saturated, we determined a NeutrAvidin binding curve using increasing amounts of cell lysate (25–200 μg of protein) from our cell surface biotinylation assay (Fig. S4). We found that our assessment of DAT surface levels was within the linear range of our assay. In saturation analyses performed in parallel and normalized to DAT surface levels, there was no difference in Km (WT, 1.7 ± 0.6 μm; T48A, 1.7 ± 0.5 μm; p > 0.05), but Vmax was significantly increased in T48A-DAT (WT, 558 ± 72 pmol/min/mg; T48A, 847 ± 142 pmol/min/mg; p < 0.01, n = 5) (Fig. 5B). Enhanced activity in the dephosphomimetic mutant suggests that uptake is reduced by phosphorylation of the site and returns to basal levels by PP1/2A-mediated dephosphorylation. The lower Vmax in the WT protein than in the T48A form is presumably driven by basal phosphorylation of this site. Other phosphorylation sites, including Ser-7, are regulated by PKC and PP1/2A (17Moritz A.E. Foster J.D. Gorentla B.K. Mazei-Robison M.S. Yang J.W. Sitte H.H. Blakely R.D. Vaughan R.A.

Hence, in order to determine whether Thr-48 mediates transport regulation by PP1/2A or PKC, we performed DA uptake analyses in the absence or presence of OA, the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or both compounds together. DA uptake activity in WT and T48A-DATs was significantly decreased in all three conditions (Fig. 5C). In the WT protein, levels of down-regulation induced by OA and PMA (17 ± 11% and 29 ± 8%, respectively) were similar to that seen in previous studies (12Vaughan R.A. Huff R.A. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J.

In animals and plants, sperm and pollen competition have yielded many interesting adaptations for improved mating success. In fungi, similar processes have not been shown directly yet. We test the hypothesis that sexual selection can increase competitive fitness during mating, using experimental evolution in the mushroom-forming fungus Schizophyllum commune (Basidiomycota). Mating in mushroom fungi occurs by donation of nuclei to a mycelium. These fertilizing ‘male’ nuclei migrate through the receiving ‘female’ mycelium. In our setup, an evolving population of nuclei was serially mated with a non-evolving female mycelium for 20 sexual generations. From the twelve tested evolved lines, four had increased and one had decreased fitness relative to an unevolved competitor. Even though only two of those five remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons, for all five lines we found a correlation between the efficiency with which the female mycelium is accessed and fitness, providing additional circumstantial evidence for fitness change in those five lines. In two lines, fitness change was also accompanied by increased spore production. The one line with net reduced competitive fitness had increased spore production, but reduced fertilisation efficiency. We did not find trade-offs between male reproductive success and other fitness components. We compare these findings with examples of sperm and pollen competition and show that many similarities between these systems and nuclear competition in mushrooms exist."

In Taiwan, such crashes typically occur when the motorcyclist is travelling alongside a row of parallel-parked cars, and a driver suddenly opens the door in front of or next to the motorcycle without determining whether it is safe to do so. Injuries resulting from motorcycle door crashes tend to be severe. This study examined the factors that contribute to motorcycle door crashes.By using linked data from the National Traffic Crash Dataset and Emergency Medical Service for Taipei City for the years 2010-2015, this study estimated a mixed multinomial logit model to predict the likelihood of three types of door crashes: driver-door crashes, left passenger-door crashes, and right passenger-door crashes.Data on 8237 motorcycle door crashes were extracted from the two datasets and matched. The results from the mixed multinomial logit model revealed that illegal parking, older car occupants, teenage car occupants, intoxicated car occupants and motorcyclists, and motorcycle speeding contribute to driver-door crashes; and female passengers and taxis as the type of vehicle involved in crash are associated with left passenger-door crashes.Our study suggested that controlling motorcycle speed, and prosecuting illegal parking and drink driving/riding may constitute effective countermeasures. The ""Dutch Reach"" intervention measure, which is commonly adopted in Europe for bicycle door crashes, should be applied in Taiwan to curb motorcycle door crashes, especially for elderly car occupants."

https://openalex.org/W2907656466,"The Nile rat (Arvicanthis niloticus) is an emerging laboratory model of type 2 diabetes. When fed standard rodent chow, the majority of males progress from hyperinsulinemia by 2 months to hyperglycemia by 6 months, while most females remain at the hyperinsulinemia-only stage (prediabetic) from 2 months onward. Since diabetic cardiomyopathy is the major cause of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-related mortality, we examined whether sexual dimorphism might entail cardiac functional changes. Our ultimate goal was to isolate the effect of diet as a modifiable lifestyle factor.Nile rats were fed either standard rodent chow (Chow group) or a high-fiber diet previously established to prevent type 2 diabetes (Fiber group). Cardiac function was determined with echocardiography at 12 months of age. To isolate the effect of diet alone, only the small subset of animals resistant to both hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia were included in this study.In males, Chow (compared to Fiber) was associated with elevated heart rate and mitral E/A velocity ratio, and with lower e'-wave velocity, isovolumetric relaxation time, and ejection time. Of note, these clinically atypical types of diastolic dysfunction occurred independently of body weight. In contrast, females did not exhibit changes in cardiovascular function between diets.The higher prevalence of T2DM in males correlates with their susceptibility to develop subtle diastolic cardiac dysfunction when fed a Western style diet (throughout most of their lifespan) despite no systemic evidence of metabolic syndrome, let alone T2DM."

Its expression is induced by a specific regulator NhaR, which is also responsible for osmC and pgaA regulation. Here I report that the NhaR regulator affects the carbon storage regulatory Csr system. I found that the expression of all major components of the Csr system–CsrA regulator, CsrB and CsrC small RNAs, and the CsrB and CsrC stability were indirectly affected by nhaR mutation under stress conditions. Using a combination of experimental and in silico analyses, I concluded that the mechanism of regulation included direct and indirect activation of a two-component system (TCS) response regulator–UvrY. NhaR regulation involved interactions with the regulators H-NS and SdiA and was affected by a naturally occurring spontaneous IS5 insertion in the promoter region. A regulatory circuit was proposed and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2908437352,"Sexually dichromatic birds often show delayed plumage maturation, but second-year (SY) males may or may not be distinguishable from females. In competitive contexts, SY males receive a reduced amount of adult males’ aggression, either by mimicking females or through signaling their sex and inexperience as subordinate males. To the human eye, reproductive dull SY male Saffron Finches are indistinguishable from females, whereas after second-year (ASY) males are golden yellow. Our aim is to establish whether SY males are sexually dichromatic with females to the eye of conspecifics. We describe plumage variation in females, SY and ASY males and, in particular, analyze assortative mating by color by comparing a previously disregarded yellow feather patch shared by the three groups. We measured plumage reflectance of the forehead, breast, belly, and axillaries, and used a two-step avian visual model analysis to estimate the ability of Saffron Finches to distinguish between SY males and females. We find that those groups are indistinguishable to conspecifics by color. Furthermore, we find non-significant evidence of assortative mating directly related to the coloration of comparable feather patches between females and each type of male, though body condition of SY males is associated to that of their mates. Our results are compatible with both the female-mimicry and the status signaling hypotheses of evolution and maintenance of delayed plumage maturation. However, the singing behavior of males reveals their presence within the breeding site; the combined effect of song and dull coloration suggest that SY males are honestly revealing their sex and status to conspecifics."
https://openalex.org/W2950528562,"Placental dysfunction is implicated in many pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia and preterm birth (PTB). While both these syndromes are influenced by environmental risk factors, they also have a substantial genetic component that is not well understood. Precisely controlled gene expression during development is crucial to proper placental function and often mediated through gene regulatory enhancers. However, we lack accurate maps of placental enhancer activity due to the challenges of assaying the placenta and the difficulty of comprehensively identifying enhancers. To address the gap in our knowledge of gene regulatory elements in the placenta, we used a two-step machine learning pipeline to synthesize existing functional genomics studies, transcription factor (TF) binding patterns, and evolutionary information to predict placental enhancers. The trained classifiers accurately distinguish enhancers from the genomic background and placental enhancers from enhancers active in other tissues. Genomic features collected from tissues and cell lines involved in pregnancy are the most predictive of placental regulatory activity. Applying the classifiers genome-wide enabled us to create a map of 33,010 predicted placental enhancers, including 4,562 high-confidence enhancer predictions. The genome-wide placental enhancers are significantly enriched nearby genes associated with placental development and birth disorders and for SNPs associated with gestational age. These genome-wide predicted placental enhancers provide candidate regions for further testing in vitro, will assist in guiding future studies of genetic associations with pregnancy phenotypes, and aid interpretation of potential mechanisms of action for variants found through genetic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2908074322,"Internal and external quality control (QC) of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is important to increase reliability of RDTs currently used to diagnose malaria. However, cross-checking of used RDTs as part of quality assurance can rarely be done by off-site personnel because there is no guarantee of retaining visible test lines after manufacturers' recommended reading time. Therefore, this study examined the potential of using Fionet™ technology for remote RDT quality monitoring at seven clinics, identifying reasons for making RDT processing and interpretation errors, and taking corrective actions for improvement of diagnosis and consequently improved management of febrile patients.The study was conducted at seven military health facilities in Mainland Tanzania and utilized RDTs capable of detecting Plasmodium falciparum specific Histidine-rich protein 2 (Pf-HRP2) and the genus specific Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) for other species of plasmodium (P. vivax, P. malariae or P. ovale; pan-pLDH). Patients' data and images of processed RDTs from seven clinics were uploaded on a Fionet web portal and reviewed regularly to monitor preparation procedures and visual interpretation of test results compared to automated analysis using the Deki reader of RDT. Problems detected were rapidly communicated to remote laboratory personnel at the clinic for corrective action and follow-up of patients who were falsely diagnosed as negative and missed treatment. Factors contributing to making errors in visual interpretation of RDT results were analyzed during visits to the health facilities.A total of 1,367 (1.6%) out of 83,294 RDT test images uploaded to the Fionet portal had discordant test results of which 822 (60.1%) and 545 (39.9%) were falsely reported as negative and positive, respectively. False negative and false positive test results were common for a single test line in 515 (62.7%) and 741 (54.2%) tests, respectively. Out of 1,367 RDT images assessed, 98 (7.2%) had quality problems related to preparation procedures of which 95(96.9%) errors were due to putting too much blood on the sample well or insufficient buffer in the respective wells. The reasons for discrepant results included, false reporting of none existent lines in 526 (38.5%) tests, missing a faint positive line in 493 (36.1%), missing a strong positive line in 248(18.1%) and errors caused by poorly processed RDTs in 96 (7.2%) tests. Among the false negative tests (n = 822), 669 (48.9%) patients were eligible for follow-up and only 339 (48.5%) were reached and 291 (85.8%) received appropriate anti-malaria therapy.Fionet technology enabled remote monitoring of RDT quality issues, identifying reasons contributing to laboratory personnel making errors and provided a rapid method to implement corrective actions at remote sites to improve malaria diagnosis and consequently improved health care management of febrile patients infected with malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2908185336,"Background The indication to bilateral nephrectomy in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney scheduled for kidney transplantation is controversial. Indeed, the progressive enlargement of cysts may increase the risk of complications and the need for nephrectomy. However, very few studies investigated the change in kidney volume after kidney transplantation. Material and methods In this prospective cohort study, the change in native kidney volume in polycystic patients was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging. Forty patients were included in the study. Kidney diameters and total kidney volume were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging in patients who underwent simultaneous nephrectomy and kidney transplantation and in patients with kidney transplant alone, before transplantation and 1 year after transplantation. Results There was a significant reduction of kidney volume after transplantation, with a mean degree of kidney diameters reduction varying from 12.24% to 14.43%. Mean total kidney volume of the 55 kidney considered in the analysis significantly reduced from 1617.94 ± 833.42 ml to 1381.42 ± 1005.73 ml (P<0.05), with a mean rate of 16.44% of volume decrease. More than 80% of patients had a volume reduction in both groups. Conclusions Polycystic kidneys volume significantly reduces after kidney transplantation, and this would reduce the need for prophylactic bilateral nephrectomy in asymptomatic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2906756595,"Background High sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates in the South, especially among young black men who have sex with men (YB MSM), make STI testing imperative for public health. Purpose To identify STI testing preferences in this population to improve testing delivery and utilization. Methods YB MSM ages 16–35 in Birmingham, Alabama participated in focus groups (FG). A trained qualitative researcher coded transcripts after each FG and added questions to explore emerging themes. Results Between September 2017 and January 2018, 36 YB MSM participated in 5 focus groups. Median age was 25.5 (Interquartile range 22–30). Participants preferred STI testing at doctors’ offices conducted by physicians but they also preferred having options related to testing locations, frequency, and timing to address diverse needs. Participants did not prefer testing by non-physician staff or home self-testing. Conclusion A variety of options, including varied locations, personnel, and methods (self-collected and provider collected) are needed to make patient-preferred STI testing a reality among YB MSM in the Deep South. Further, the desire to be tested by a trusted physician highlights the need for access to primary care providers. Results suggest that newer home-based tests and self-collected tests are less preferable to YB MSM in the South, which deserves further study as these tests are rapidly integrated into clinical care."
https://openalex.org/W2906968878,"Introduction In this study we developed the Disability Beliefs Scale to assess Veterans’ beliefs that engaging in treatment, as well as other behaviors, would affect the likelihood of a Veteran’s being awarded disability-related benefits. We posited that Veterans with stronger beliefs that attending mental health treatment would facilitate a service-connection award would be more likely to attend PTSD treatment before their compensation and pension examinations for PTSD. Methods Electronic health records for 307 post-9/11-era Veterans applying for compensation and pension for service-connected PTSD and engaging in a clinical trial of a treatment-referral intervention were analyzed for PTSD-specific and more general mental health treatment use around the time of their compensation examinations. All participants completed the Disability Beliefs Scale and other baseline assessments. Multilevel models assessed change in treatment use as a function of time relative to the C&P exam, compensation examination status (before or after), and the interaction between examination status and beliefs about treatment benefits. Results No main effects of time or examination status were observed. As hypothesized, beliefs about treatment benefits moderated the effect of examination status on PTSD treatment use. Veterans believing more strongly that mental health treatment would help a claim differentially attended PTSD treatment before the examination than after. The effect was not observed for general mental health treatment use. Conclusion The association between Veterans’ use of PTSD treatment and their service-connection examination status was moderated by beliefs that receiving treatment affects the service-connection decision. This suggests that factors reported to motivate seeking service-connection—finances, validation of Veterans’ experiences, and the involvement of significant others—might also help motivate Veterans’ use of effective PTSD treatments. However, the results reflect correlations that could be explained in other ways, and service-connection was one of many factors impacting PTSD treatment engagement."
https://openalex.org/W2908077115,"Northwestern China, an important part of the Silk Road, was the birthplace of the Zhouzu farming culture. The domestication of cattle as an important aspect of farming culture has had a long history in northwestern China. In this study, we assessed the maternal structure and phylogeny of cattle by analyzing the mitochondrial DNA hypervariable segment I (HVS-I) in 698 native cattle from eight areas of northwestern China. The phylogenetic analyses revealed two highly divergent mtDNA clades: clade T, which had four sub-clades (Ta-Td), and clade I. The cattle domesticated from Bos taurus showed a clear dominant distribution pattern in northwestern China. The nucleotide diversity of the Bos indicus clade was lower than that of clades from Bos taurus. In summary, our results suggest that the native cattle of northwestern China were domesticated from two different maternal ancestors, Bos taurus and Bos indicus, which migrated to the central plains of China from the north and south, respectively, with Bos taurus remaining at the edges of the region. The population expansion of the cattle domesticated from Bos taurus occurred in the Longdong region of Gansu Province, and these cattle formed four relatively independent evolutionary branches. Subsequent to this expansion event, Bos indicus migrated from southern to northern China."
https://openalex.org/W2905809421,"This study attempts to develop empirical correlations between average penetration resistance (), averaged velocities over depth up to bedrock depth () and 30 m () for shallow depth sites (having bedrock at a depth less than 25 m). A total of 63 shallow sites were assessed for penetration resistance values up to the bedrock from Standard Penetration Tests (SPT) and dynamic soil property analysis, i.e., Shear Wave Velocity (VS) from Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves. The study shows that 30 m averaged shear wave velocities are more than the average velocity up to bedrock depth in shallow bedrock sites because of inclusion of rock site velocity. Furthermore, averaged SPT-N() and average VS () up to bedrock depth were correlated with the 30 m average() values. This is the first attempt in developing empirical relationships of this kind for seismic site classification. These correlations can be made useful for seismic site classification of sites in regions with Standard Penetration Test (NSPT) values and limited VS values. Further surface and bedrock motion recordings of 12 selected KiK-net shallow depth sites were collected and amplifications were estimated with the respective peak ground acceleration, spectral acceleration and thereby related to the average shear wave velocity up to bedrock and 30 m. The results show that the amplification is better correlated to the than for shallow depth sites, and more data can be added to strengthen this correlation."
https://openalex.org/W2907743955,"This study was designed to examine the potential involvement of reactive oxygen species in skeletal muscle dysfunction linked with stretching in a mouse model and to explore the effects of combined antioxidant intake on peripheral leukocyte apoptosis following eccentrically-biased downhill runs in human subjects. In the mouse model, diaphragmatic muscle was stretched by 30% of its optimal length, followed by 5-min contraction. Muscle function and extracellular reactive oxygen species release was measured ex vivo. In human models, participants performed two trials of downhill running either with or without antioxidant supplementation, followed by apoptotic assay of inflammatory cells in the blood. The results showed that stretch led to decreased muscle function and prominent ROS increase during muscle contraction. In human models, we observed an elevation in circulating leukocyte apoptosis 24-48 hours following acute downhill runs. However, there is an attenuated leukocyte apoptosis following the second bout of downhill run. Interestingly, the combination of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and α-tocopherol (vitamin E) supplementation attenuated the decrease in B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) at 24 hours following acute downhill running. These data collectively suggest that significant ROS formation can be induced by muscle-lengthening associated with eccentric exercise, which is accompanied by compromised muscle function. The combination of antioxidants supplementation appears to have a protective role via the attenuation of decrease in anti-apoptotic protein."
https://openalex.org/W2907927681,"Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) is a transcription factor trimer binding to the functionally important CCAAT box, present in promoters of growth-promoting and cell cycle-regulated genes. The regulatory nuclear factor YA (NF-YA) subunit confers sequence-specificity to the histone-like nuclear factor YB/YC dimer. NF-YA harbors 2 serines—Ser320 and Ser326—shown to be phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 2. High-throughput proteomics data indicate that they are phosphorylated in vivo. Specifically, Ser320 makes structural contacts with the DNA phosphate backbone; Ser320-P is the major NF-YA phosphorylation isoform following overexpression in HeLa cells, increasing upon mitotic arrest. EMSA with recombinant Ala and Glu mutants confirm a role of Ser320, but not Ser326, in stabilization of DNA binding. Transactivation assays of the CCAAT-dependent MDR1 and RHOB promoters show loss in transcription function for Ser320Glu and Ser320Ala NF-YA mutants. Phylogenetic analysis of NF-YA proteins indicates that Ser320 is indeed evolutionarily conserved. We conclude that phosphorylation of this residue belongs to the core mechanisms of DNA-binding control, possibly driven by the necessity to unfasten binding of or to evict NF-Y from CCAAT sites under specific conditions of growth regulation.—Bernardini, A., Lorenzo, M., Nardini, M., Mantovani, R., Gnesutta, N.

https://openalex.org/W2792842311,"Recent tobacco taxation research suggests that excise tax structure plays an important role in the effectiveness of increasing taxes in reducing consumption. However, evidence on excise tax structures of alcoholic beverages is scarce. We linked price variability measures for beer, wine, and liquor in the US derived using Economist Intelligence Unit city data from 2003 to 2016 with state-level excise tax structures from the Alcohol Policy Information System. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions were performed to assess the associations between excise tax structures and price variability, for beer, wine, and liquor (spirits), respectively. Results suggest that, compared with a specific excise beer tax structure based on volumes, a mixed structure with both specific and ad valorem components was associated with 38% (p≤0.01) greater beer price variability. In addition, a mixed excise tax structure for liquor was associated with 60-77% (p≤0.01) greater liquor price variability. However, these associations do not imply a causal link between tax structures and price variability. In summary, a mixed excise tax structure is associated with greater variability in beer and liquor prices, an indicator for tax avoidance opportunities. Future research is needed to identify the causal impact of tax structures on price variability."
https://openalex.org/W2907077759,"HIV-1 co-infection is a leading cause of susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB), with the risk of TB being increased at all stages of HIV-1 infection. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) is the most effective way to reduce the risk of TB in HIV-1 co-infected people. Studying protective, ART-induced, immune restoration in HIV-1 infected individuals sensitised by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can thus help identify mechanisms of protection against TB. In order to understand ART-mediated prevention of TB in HIV-1 infected adults, we investigated the expression of 30 genes in whole blood from HIV-1 infected patients during the first 6 months of ART-induced immune reconstitution. The 30 selected genes were previously described to be differentially expressed between sorted Mtb specific central and effector memory CD4 T cells. HIV-1 infected persons sensitised by Mtb were recruited in Khayelitsha, South Africa, when initiating ART. RNA was extracted from whole blood at initiation and 1, 3 and 6 months of ART. qRT-PCR was used to determine gene expression and three reference ‘housekeeping’ genes were used to calculate the fold change in the expression of each gene relative to day 0 of ART. Results were assessed longitudinally. We observed a decrease in the expression of a number of genes at 6 months of ART, reflecting a decrease in immune activation. However, following correction for multiple comparisons and increasing CD4 counts, only the decrease in CD27 gene expression remained statistically significant. While not statistically significant, a number of genes also showed increased expression at various timepoints, illustrating the broad regeneration of the T cell pool in HIV-1 infected adults on ART. Our findings generate hypotheses underlying ART- induced protective immune reconstitution and may pave the way for future studies to evaluate ART mediated prevention of TB in HIV-1 infected persons."
https://openalex.org/W2907358952,"Introduction The majority of newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients are followed initially by watch and wait (WAW). Clinical practice varies and the value of frequent follow-up visits remains unclear. Thus, in this study we investigated the clinical value of follow-up visits for patients with CLL. Methods We collected data from diagnosis and follow-up visits for patients diagnosed with CLL and managed by WAW in the North Denmark Region between 2007–2014. High- and low-risk group patients were determined by Binet stage, IgVH status, and cytogenetics at diagnosis. The effect of risk group allocation on the probability of receiving CLL-directed treatment within two years was included in a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for age and blood test results. Results 273 patients were included in the study with a median follow-up of 3 years (IQR: 1.6–5.4). Overall, the median interval between follow-up visits was 98 days (95% CI: 96–100) (high-risk patients: 91 days [95% CI: 86–95] vs. low-risk patients: 105 days [95% CI: 100–110]). Among 2,312 follow-up visits, only 387 (17%) were associated with interventions. At the following time points: 6 months, 1 year, and 1.5 years, patients with low-risk CLL had significantly lower odds of initiating treatment compared to patients with high-risk CLL. Conclusion WAW plays an important role in managing CLL. Interventions at follow-up visits were infrequent and low-risk patients had significantly lower risk of treatment initiation. We question the value of routine follow-up in CLL in the absence of changes in symptoms and/or blood test results."
https://openalex.org/W2907470956,"Antibody array analysis of labeled proteomes has high throughput and is simple to perform, but validation remains challenging. Here, we used differential detergent fractionation and size exclusion chromatography in sequence for high-resolution separation of biotinylated proteins from human primary keratinocytes and leukocytes. Ninety-six sample fractions from each cell type were analyzed with microsphere-based antibody arrays and flow cytometry (microsphere affinity proteomics; MAP). Monomeric proteins and multi-molecular complexes in the cytosol, cytoplasmic organelles, membranes and nuclei were resolved as discrete peaks of antibody reactivity across the fractions. The fractionation also provided a two-dimensional matrix for assessment of specificity. Thus, antibody reactivity peaks were considered to represent specific binding if the position in the matrix was in agreement with published information about i) subcellular location, ii) size of the intended target, and iii) cell type-dependent variation in protein expression. Similarities in the reactivity patterns of either different antibodies to the same protein or antibodies to similar proteins were used as additional supporting evidence. This approach provided validation of several hundred proteins and identification of monomeric proteins and protein complexes. High-resolution MAP solves many of the problems associated with obtaining specificity with immobilized antibodies and a protein label. Thus, laboratories with access to chromatography and flow cytometry can perform large-scale protein analysis on a daily basis. This opens new possibilities for cell biology research in dermatology and validation of antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2908509737,"Exotic invasive fish species, when introduced into pristine natural environments, threaten the survival of many endemic species. Management challenges associated with controlling their further spread and protecting endemic species can be exacerbated when the same exotic fish species also provide gastronomical benefits to humans. Local human populations can switch their consumption preferences toward the exotic fish species, leading to an increase in their spread rate and control costs. Using the example of the African Catfish invasion in a freshwater lake, we develop a bioeconomic model of its optimal control, which also incorporates the behavioral challenges arising from a gastronomical preference for the exotic fish species. In particular, the cost of catfish control increases with its consumption demand, which, through altering the inter-species dynamics, threatens the survival of endemic fish species. The manager has at his disposal the market and non-market values of the endemic fish species to invest toward their preservation efforts. The non-market value of the endemic species is further modeled as endogenous to the community's preference switching. Results suggest that a late detection of the exotic fish species in freshwater bodies can increase their control costs enough to make their eradication challenging, especially when the manager faces financial resource constraints. The presence of behavioral effects adds to this challenge - directly, through increasing the control costs, and indirectly, through lowering the non-market value of the endemic fish species."
https://openalex.org/W2908399260,"Background We have used a previously reported rabbit model of fetal growth restriction (FGR), reproducing perinatal neurodevelopmental and cardiovascular impairments, to investigate the main relative changes in cerebral and cardiac metabolism of term FGR fetuses during nutrient infusion. Methods FGR was induced in 9 pregnant New Zealand rabbits at 25 days of gestation: one horn used as FGR, by partial ligation of uteroplacental vessels, and the contralateral as control (appropriate for gestation age, AGA). At 30 days of gestation, fasted mothers under anesthesia were infused i.v. with 1-13C-glucose (4 mothers), 2-13C-acetate (3 mothers), or not infused (2 mothers). Fetal brain and heart samples were quickly harvested and frozen down. Brain cortex and heart apex regions from 30 fetuses were studied ex vivo by HRMAS at 4°C, acquiring multinuclear 1D and 2D spectra. The data were processed, quantified by peak deconvolution or integration, and normalized to sample weight. Results Most of the total 13C-labeling reaching the fetal brains/hearts (80–90%) was incorporated to alanine and lactate (cytosol), and to the glutamine-glutamate pool (mitochondria). Acetate-derived lactate (Lac C2C3) had a slower turnover in FGR brains (~ -20%). In FGR hearts, mitochondrial turnover of acetate-derived glutamine (Gln C4) was slower (-23%) and there was a stronger accumulation of phospholipid breakdown products (glycerophosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine, +50%), resembling the profile of non-infused control hearts. Conclusions Our results indicate specific functional changes in cerebral and cardiac metabolism of FGR fetuses under nutrient infusion, suggesting glial impairment and restricted mitochondrial metabolism concomitant with slower cell membrane turnover in cardiomyocytes, respectively. These prenatal metabolic changes underlie neurodevelopmental and cardiovascular problems observed in this FGR model and in clinical patients, paving the way for future studies aimed at evaluating metabolic function postnatally and in response to stress and/or treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2906305439,"Since the use of language is a core aspect of psychotherapy, its study requires instruments that allow for further research. The aim of this study is to present an observational instrument capable of analyzing the language used in psychotherapeutic settings, both by therapists and clients. The SICOLENTE instrument was applied to two different samples: The Three Approaches to Psychotherapy film and a naturalistic sample. 7710 utterances from 31 sessions (three from the demonstration film and 28 from a naturalistic setting) were coded. Two studies were conducted: in the first study, inter and intra coder reliability (dimension and category levels) and Generalizability theory analyzes were assessed, whilst in the second study, construct validity was tested with several hypotheses. The final instrument resulted in 20 categories with three dimensions: Conversational Act (7 categories), Therapeutic topic (6 categories) and Content (7 categories). The three dimensions showed excellent inter and intra coder reliability and the generalizability coefficients were excellent. Out of the 24 validity hypothesis proposed,19 were accepted. The finding suggests that the SICOLENTE is a reliable and valid instrument that can be applied to investigate the performance of various theoretical models. Its three dimensional structure gives it the flexibility to be able to carry out macroscopic or microscopic language research."
https://openalex.org/W2907359614,"Recognizing what physicians know and do not know about a particular disease is one of the keys to designing clinical decision support systems, since these systems can fulfill complementary role by recognizing this boundary. To our knowledge, however, no study has attempted to quantify how many diseases physicians actually know and thus the boundary is unclear. This study explores a method to solve this problem by investigating whether the vocabulary assessment techniques developed in the linguistics field can be applied to assess physicians' knowledge.The test design required us to pay special attention to disease knowledge assessment. First, to avoid imposing unnecessary burdens on the physicians, we chose a self-assessment questionnaire that was straightforward to fill out. Second, to prevent overestimation, we used a ""pseudo-word"" approach: fictitious diseases were included in the questionnaire, and positive responses to them were penalized. Third, we used paper-based tests, rather than computer-based ones, to further prevent participants from cheating by using a search engine. Fourth, we selectively used borderline diseases, i.e., diseases that physicians might or might not know about, rather than well-known or little-known diseases, in the questionnaire.We collected 102 valid answers from 109 physicians who attended the seminars we conducted. On the basis of these answers, we estimated that the average physician knew of 2008 diseases (95% confidence interval: (1939, 2071)). This preliminary estimation agrees with the guideline for the national license examination in Japan, suggesting that this vocabulary assessment was able to evaluate physicians' knowledge. The survey included physicians with various backgrounds, but there were no significant differences between subgroups. Other implication for researches on clinical decision support and limitation of the sampling method adopted in this study are also discussed, toward more rigorous estimation in future surveys."
https://openalex.org/W2908444454,"Genetic maps order genetic markers along chromosomes. They are, for instance, extensively used in marker-assisted selection to accelerate breeding programs. Even for the same species, people often have to deal with several alternative maps obtained using different ordering methods or different datasets, e.g. resulting from different segregating populations. Having efficient tools to identify the consistency and discrepancy of alternative maps is thus essential to facilitate genetic map comparisons. We propose to encode genetic maps by bucket order, a kind of order, which takes into account the blurred parts of the marker order while being an efficient data structure to achieve low complexity algorithms. The main result of this paper is an O(n log(n)) procedure to identify the largest agreements between two bucket orders of n elements, their Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), providing an efficient solution to highlight discrepancies between two genetic maps. The LCS of two maps, being the largest set of their collinear markers, is used as a building block to compute pairwise map congruence, to visually emphasize maker collinearity and in some scaffolding methods relying on genetic maps to improve genome assembly. As the LCS computation is a key subroutine of all these genetic map related tools, replacing the current LCS subroutine of those methods by ours –to do the exact same work but faster– could significantly speed up those methods without changing their accuracy. To ease such transition we provide all required algorithmic details in this self contained paper as well as an R package implementing them, named LCSLCIS, which is freely available at: https://github.com/holtzy/LCSLCIS."
