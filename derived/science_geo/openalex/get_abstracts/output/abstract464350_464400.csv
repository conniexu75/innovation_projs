Lukas and Clutton-Brock (p. 526 ; see the Perspective by Kappeler ) examined data from over 2500 mammalian species across 26 orders containing 60 evolutionary transitions to monogamy. In every case, the ancestral condition was one where females were solitary and where male infanticide was unusual. Monogamy appears to arise not as a response to a need for paternal care, but largely as a mate-guarding strategy."
https://openalex.org/W1967434207,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are critical in the control of gene expression, and dysregulation of their activity has been implicated in a broad range of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) employing different zinc chelating functionalities such as hydroxamic acids and benzamides have shown promising results in cancer therapy. Although it has also been suggested that HDACi with increased isozyme selectivity and potency may broaden their clinical utility and minimize side effects, the translation of this idea to the clinic remains to be investigated. Moreover, a detailed understanding of how HDACi with different pharmacological properties affect biological functions in vitro and in vivo is still missing. Here, we show that a panel of benzamide-containing HDACi are slow tight-binding inhibitors with long residence times unlike the hydroxamate-containing HDACi vorinostat and trichostatin-A. Characterization of changes in H2BK5 and H4K14 acetylation following HDACi treatment in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y revealed that the timing and magnitude of histone acetylation mirrored both the association and dissociation kinetic rates of the inhibitors. In contrast, cell viability and microarray gene expression analysis indicated that cell death induction and changes in transcriptional regulation do not correlate with the dissociation kinetic rates of the HDACi. Therefore, our study suggests that determining how the selective and kinetic inhibition properties of HDACi affect cell function will help to evaluate their therapeutic utility."

Although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reduced ER-to-Golgi protein trafficking have been implicated, the exact mechanisms whereby saturated fatty acids trigger β-cell death remain elusive. Using mass spectroscopic lipidomics and subcellular fractionation, we demonstrate that palmitate pretreatment of MIN6 β-cells promoted ER remodeling of both phospholipids and sphingolipids, but only the latter was causally linked to lipotoxic ER stress. Thus, overexpression of glucosylceramide synthase, previously shown to protect against defective protein trafficking and ER stress, partially reversed lipotoxic reductions in ER sphingomyelin (SM) content and aggregation of ER lipid rafts, as visualized using Erlin1-GFP. Using both lipidomics and a sterol response element reporter assay, we confirmed that free cholesterol in the ER was also reciprocally modulated by chronic palmitate and glucosylceramide synthase overexpression. This is consistent with the known coregulation and association of SM and free cholesterol in lipid rafts. Inhibition of SM hydrolysis partially protected against ATF4/C/EBP homology protein induction because of palmitate. Our results suggest that loss of SM in the ER is a key event for initiating β-cell lipotoxicity, which leads to disruption of ER lipid rafts, perturbation of protein trafficking, and initiation of ER stress."

Some HDAC inhibitors are widely considered as promising anticancer therapeutics. A major obstacle for development of HDAC inhibitors as highly safe and effective anticancer therapeutics is that our current knowledge on the contributions of different HDACs in various cancer types remains scant. Here we report that the expression level of HDAC10 was significantly lower in patients exhibiting lymph node metastasis compared with that in patients lacking lymph node metastasis in human cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Forced expression of HDAC10 in cervical cancer cells significantly inhibited cell motility and invasiveness in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, HDAC10 suppresses expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and 9 genes, which are known to be critical for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. At the molecular level, HDAC10 binds to MMP2 and -9 promoter regions, reduces the histone acetylation level, and inhibits the binding of RNA polymerase II to these regions. Furthermore, an HDAC10 mutant lacking histone deacetylase activity failed to mimic the functions of full-length protein. These results identify a critical role of HDAC10 in suppression of cervical cancer metastasis, underscoring the importance of developing isoform-specific HDAC inhibitors for treatment of certain cancer types such as cervical squamous cell carcinoma.Background: Aberrant expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been found in several kinds of cancer.Results: HDAC10, a class IIb HDAC, can suppress cervical cancer metastasis.Conclusion: Unlike most other HDACs, which promote carcinogenesis, HDAC10 serves as a tumor suppressor in cervical cancer.Significance: Isoform-specific HDAC inhibitors could be indicated in the clinical treatment of cervical cancer.

Conclusion: Unlike most other HDACs, which promote carcinogenesis, HDAC10 serves as a tumor suppressor in cervical cancer. Significance: Isoform-specific HDAC inhibitors could be indicated in the clinical treatment of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a common gynecologic malignant neoplasm. The occurrence of invasion and distant metastasis are important events that affect the prognosis and treatment of cervical cancer. For the earliest stage of cervical cancer, more than 90% of women survive at least 5 years after diagnosis. However, later stages of cervical cancer with invasion or metastasis have a significantly worse outlook. Fewer than 20% of women with stage IV cervical cancer survive for 5 or more years (1.The Merck Manual Home Health Handbook (2013) Cervical Cancer, www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/cancers_of_the_female_reproductive_system/cervical_cancer.html.Google Scholar). Some of the cervical cancer cells can metastasize through lymph nodes or blood circulation and form a secondary cancer. They most often spread to the liver, lungs, and bones. Prognosis drops deeply in patient with metastasis as treatment of local lesions is generally more effective than whole body treatments (2.Armenian Medical Network (2013) Cervical Cancer, www.health.am/cr/cervical-cancer/.Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cell invasion and metastasis is critical for developing effective cervical cancer therapies and improving patient survival rate. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 3The abbreviations used are: MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseHDAChistone deacetylaseTIMPtissue inhibitor of metalloproteinaseDACdeacetylaseLRDleucine-rich domainNOD-SCIDnonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficientTNMtumor node metastasis. are closely associated with the pathogenesis and progression of cancer. They are zinc-dependent endopeptidases, which are capable of degrading the extracellular matrix (3.Boothello, R., (2011) Matrix Metalloproteinases: Its Implications in Cardiovascular Disorders, pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/11/matrix-metalloproteinases-its-implications-in-cardiovascular-disorders/.Google Scholar). They play important roles in many cell behaviors such as cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, differentiation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. MMP2 and -9 are two widely studied matrix metalloproteinases that can regulate cell migration and invasion of cancer cells and are linked to the process of metastasis (4.Wang X.X. Cheng Q. Zhang S.N.

The MMPs are inhibited by specific endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which form tight 1:1 complexes with MMPs and block their function. MMP2 is specifically inhibited by TIMP2, whereas MMP9 is specifically inhibited by TIMP1 (13.Vasala K.

Aberrant expression of HDACs is often associated with carcinogenesis and cancer clinical prognosis (14.Weichert W. HDAC expression and clinical prognosis in human malignancies.Cancer Lett. 2009; 280: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The main function of HDACs is to remove acetyl groups from the N-acetyllysines on histone and thus modify the chromatin structure and modulate gene transcription (15.Sengupta N. Seto E. Regulation of histone deacetylase activities.J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). HDACs can regulate the expression of cancer-relevant genes, so they are targets of a promising class of anticancer drugs. Several HDAC inhibitors (e.g. suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, valproic acid, and trichostatin A) have been used for cancer treatment clinically or are under clinical trials (14.Weichert W. HDAC expression and clinical prognosis in human malignancies.Cancer Lett. 2009; 280: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). They inhibit carcinogenesis through multiple mechanisms including inhibiting cancer cell proliferation (16.Venkataramani V. Rossner C. Iffland L. Schweyer S. Tamboli I.Y. Walter J. Wirths O.

Classes I, II, and IV contain 11 family members, which are called classical HDACs, whereas the seven class III family members are referred to as sirtuins (20.Witt O. Deubzer H.E. Milde T. Oehme I. HDAC family: what are the cancer relevant targets?.Cancer Lett. 2009; 277: 8-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). HDAC10 is a class IIb HDAC, which, unlike the other class IIb HDAC HDAC6 that has two tandem deacetylase domains, has one deacetylase (DAC) domain and one additional catalytically inactive leucine-rich domain (LRD) (21.Tong J.J. Liu J. Bertos N.R. Yang X.J. Identification of HDAC10, a novel class II human histone deacetylase containing a leucine-rich domain.Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It has been reported that HDAC10 can relieve repression on the melanogenic program (22.Lai I.L. Lin T.P. Yao Y.L. Lin C.Y. Hsieh M.J. Yang W.M.

However, compared with many other HDACs, the function of HDAC10 in cancer is largely unknown. In this study, we show that HDAC10 is inversely related to lymph node metastasis in human patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HDAC10 inhibits cervical cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Additionally, we found that HDAC10 binds to the promoter regions of MMP2 and -9, deacetylates histones H3 and H4 in these regions, blocks the binding of RNA polymerase II, and consequently down-regulates MMP2 and -9 expression. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that HDAC10 acts as a suppressor of cancer metastasis. Below, we present our data leading to the findings and discuss the significance and implication of our study on the design of HDAC inhibitor-based anticancer therapy. The human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa-S3 and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The human cervical carcinoma cell line Caski was purchased from the Cell Bank at the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences. HeLa-S3 and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen). Caski cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To express FLAG-tagged HDAC10, the coding region of HDAC10 (a gift from Wen-Ming Yang; Ref. 22.Lai I.L. Lin T.P. Yao Y.L. Lin C.Y. Hsieh M.J. Yang W.M.

Deletion mutations of HDAC10 were made in this laboratory using restriction enzymes and PCR. HeLa cells and HEK293T cells were transfected with X-tremeGENE HP (Roche Applied Science) or ExcellGene DNA transfection reagent. To generate lentivirus particles, lentiviral vector fugw, which contains the target gene, was co-transfected with a helper plasmid encoding gag, pol, and env into HEK293T cells, and virus was obtained 48 h after transfection. HeLa cells were transfected with DNA vectors or siRNA duplexes. 48 h after transfection, cells were collected, and cell migration ability was analyzed using Transwell chambers (Corning catalog number 3422). For migration, HeLa cells were suspended in DMEM with 1% FBS and added to the upper chambers (5 × 104cells/well). Then the chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. After that, cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed. The membranes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and cells on the undersurface were stained with Hoechst 33342. The chambers were observed under a fluorescence microscope, and cells from five randomly fields were counted. For invasion, the chambers were precoated with matrigel (BD Biosciences; 50 mg/ml; 1:8) at 37 °C for 4 h. After cells were added (1 × 105cells/well), the chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. The experimental conditions for Caski cells were as follows: 1 × 105 cells/well, 16 h for migration and 1 × 105 cells/well, 24 h for invasion. Anti-HDAC10 (H3413), anti-MMP9 (HPA001238), and anti-FLAG (F7425) antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-GAPDH (sc-47724) and anti-p65 (sc-372) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-AP1 (9165) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-TIMP1 (BS1697), anti-TIMP2 (BS1366), and anti-MMP2 (BS1236) antibodies were purchased from Bioworld. For Western blotting, cells were lysed with 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged. Then an equal amount of protein was loaded for 10% SDS-PAGE. Signals were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). siRNAs recognizing HDAC10 were purchased from Sigma. The sequences of these two siRNAs are as follows: CGGAGUCAGUGUGCAUGACAGUACA and UCACUGCACUUGGGAAGCUCCUGUA. To generate virus, shRNA against the second site was cloned into pLKO.1 lentivirus vector. Total RNA of the cells was extracted using RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with TaKaRa PrimeScript RT reagent kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. Real time PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) on a Stratagene Mx3000P (Stratagene). Data were collected and analyzed. The expression level of each gene was normalized to actin expression and further normalized to the control group. The primer sequences were as follows: for MMP2, 5′-CCGTCGCCCATCATCAAGTT-3′ and 5′-CTGTCTGGGGCAGTCCAAAG-3′; for MMP9, 5′-GGGACGCAGACATCGTCATC-3′ and 5′-TCGTCATCGTCGAAATGGGC-3′; for TIMP1, 5′-GGGACACCAGAAGTCAACCA-3′ and 5′-GGCTTGGAACCCTTTATACATC-3′; for TIMP2, 5′-AAAGCGGTCAGTGAGAAGGA-3′ and 5′-CTTCTTTCCTCCAACGTCCA-3′; and for β-actin, 5′-GACCTGTACGCCAACACAG-3′ and 5′-CTCAGGAGGAGCAATGATC-3′. Cervical cancer tissue microarrays were purchased from the National Engineering Center for BioChips in Shanghai, China. Institutional Review Board permission for the use of samples was obtained. The evaluation of expression was made blindly by two independent observers simultaneously, and a consensus score was recorded. MMP2 (sc-10736) and MMP9 (sc-21733) antibodies used in staining were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The staining was scored according to the staining intensity and the percentage of cells stained. Staining intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weakly positive), 2 (strongly positive), and 3 (very strongly positive). The percentages of cells stained were scored into five categories: 0 (0%), 1 (1–25%), 2 (26–50%), 3 (51–75%), and 4 (76–100%). The final staining scores were calculated by staining intensity × percentage of stained cells. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was carried out according to a published procedure (25.Im H. Grass J.A. Johnson K.D. Boyer M.E. Wu J. Bresnick E.H. Measurement of protein-DNA interactions in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 284: 129-146PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the non-treated and HDAC10-transfected HeLa cells were sonicated and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. Then the chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific to HDAC10 (Sigma), acetyl-H3 (Millipore), acetyl-H4 (Millipore), RNA polymerase II (Millipore), or control rabbit IgG (Millipore) at 4 °C overnight. After DNAs were dissociated from immunoprecipitated chromatin, the amounts of the specific DNA fragments were quantified by real time PCR and normalized against the genomic DNA preparation from the same cells. Ten 6–8-week-old male nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice were injected with 5 × 106 control or HDAC10-overexpressng HeLa cells (five mice per group). Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS and injected through the lateral tail vein of the mice (200 μl/mouse). 4 weeks after injection, mice were euthanized, and lungs were isolated and photographed. The number of surface metastases per lung was counted and recorded. All experiments were carried out at the Laboratory Animal Center of Tongji University with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval in accordance with institutional guidelines. To establish this model, 30 BALB/c nude mice (15 per group) were anesthetized, and their right hind limb foot pads were slowly injected with 50 μl of control or HDAC10-overexpressing HeLa cell suspension at a concentration of 8 × 104/μl. 4, 6, and 8 weeks after injection, mice were euthanized (n = 5), and their right popliteal, inguinal, and common iliac lymph node tissues were fixed and analyzed by H&E staining. Plasmids encoding FLAG-HDAC10 was transfected into HEK293T cells. 48 h after transfection, cells were collected and lysed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors). Then the cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG mAb M2-agarose beads (Sigma) for 4 h. The beads were washed with lysis buffer three times, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies as specified. To evaluate the clinical relevance of HDAC10 in cervical cancer patients, we analyzed cervical cancer microarrays with HDAC10 antibody. The cervical cancer microarrays that we used contain 60 patients. A sample of cancer tissue and a corresponding normal tissue from each patient were included. The clinical information of these patients is shown in Table 1. HDAC10 expression was detected in normal cervical tissues as well as cervical squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 1, A–D). Furthermore, HDAC10 was expressed in both the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. There was no difference in the level of HDAC10 between normal and carcinoma tissues (Fig. 1E). However, we found that in carcinoma tissues the level of HDAC10 in patients with lymph node metastasis was significantly lower than those lacking lymph node metastasis (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, the HDAC10 expression level was significantly higher in patients with TNM stages I and II than those with stages III and IV (Fig. 1G, I and II versus III and IV). These results suggest that the expression level of HDAC10 is inversely correlated with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage in cervical cancer.TABLE 1Clinical and pathologic characteristics of patient with cervical cancer (n = 60)Characteristicsn = 60HDAC10 scorep valueAge<40 years16 (28–38 years)4.3130.814≥40 years44 (40–73 years)4.182Tumor size<4 cm444.1360.5879≥4 cm164.438Lymph node metastasisNegative235.0870.038Positive373.676TNM stageI-II224.9550.0193III-IV383.789 Open table in a new tab The inverse relationship between HDAC10 and lymph node metastasis that we observed in human cervical cancer patients prompted us to test whether HDAC10 plays a role in regulation of cervical cancer cell migration and invasion, processes that are critical for metastasis. To do this, we transiently transfected human HeLa cervical cancer cells with plasmids containing HDAC10 cDNA and two different siRNAs targeting HDAC10, respectively. Western blotting confirmed that the level of HDAC10 was increased in cells transfected with HDAC10 cDNA expression vector but reduced in cells transfected with HDAC10 siRNAs (Fig. 2A). As the second siRNA is more efficient, we designed an shRNA according to this target sequence and cloned it into a pLKO.1 lentivirus vector. Lentivirus particles containing HDAC10 cDNA or this shRNA were used to infect the human cervical cancer cell line Caski, which has low transient transfection efficiency. The infection efficiency is shown in Fig. 2B. Next, we tested whether cell migration was altered in response to a change in HDAC10 expression with a Transwell assay. The results showed that overexpression of HDAC10 significantly reduced the migration of these two cervical cancer cell lines (Fig. 2, C and D, upper panels). In contrast, depletion of HDAC10 significantly increased cell migration (Fig. 2, C and D, lower panels). We next tested the effect of HDAC10 on cervical cancer cell invasion. To do this, Transwell chambers were precoated with matrigel. The detailed steps are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results showed that cell invasion of these two cell lines was dramatically inhibited by HDAC10 overexpression. Conversely, HDAC10-deficient cells exhibited a much stronger invasive activity than control cells (Fig. 2, E and F). Next, we analyzed the proliferation rate of HeLa cells expressing different levels of HDAC10. Depletion or overexpression of HDAC10 does not significantly alter cervical cancer cell proliferation. Consistent with this, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis showed that the proportion of the cells in G1, S, and G2 phases was not influenced by the level of HDAC10 (data not shown). Similarly, neither elevating nor reducing the expression level of HDAC10 induced cancer cell apoptosis (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that HDAC10 plays an important and specific role in regulation of cervical cell migration and invasion but not proliferation or apoptosis. Previous studies have shown that MMP2 and -9 are pivotal for cervical cancer invasion (26.Kato Y. Yamashita T. Ishikawa M. Relationship between expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 and invasion ability of cervical cancer cells.Oncol. Rep. 2002; 9: 565-569PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether HDAC10, which suppresses cervical cancer cell migration and invasion (Fig. 2), plays a role in regulation of MMP2 and -9, we analyzed the effects of HDAC10 on MMP2 and -9 expression levels. In HeLa cells, both the mRNA level (Fig. 3, A and B) and protein level (Fig. 3E) of MMP2 and -9 were decreased in response to increased HDAC10 expression. Conversely, depletion of HDAC10 significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of MMP2 and -9 (Fig. 3, A, B, and E). Although alteration of HDAC10 expression regulates the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, it does not affect MMP11 (Fig. 3E). Previous studies have shown that MMP2 can interact with TIMP2 and be specifically inhibited by it, whereas MMP9 can be specifically inhibited by TIMP1 (13.Vasala K. Matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 and MMP-9 and their inhibitors TIMP-1 And TIMP-2 in bladder carcinoma.Acta Univ. Oul. D. 2008; 983Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed the expression levels of TIMP1 and TIMP2 in response to alterations of HDAC10 expression in HeLa cells. The results showed that increased expression of HDAC10 up-regulated whereas depletion of HDAC10 down-regulated the levels of TIMP1 and TIMP2 (Fig. 3, C–E). To confirm the function of HDAC10 in regulating these genes, we replicated these experiments in the cervical cancer cell line Caski and obtained similar results (Fig. 3F). Next, we further investigated the relationship between the expression level of HDAC10 and MMP2 and -9 in clinical cervical cancer patients. Microarrays shown in Fig. 1 were analyzed with MMP2 and MMP9 antibodies. Patients were divided into two groups according to HDAC10 score. The results of microarrays reveal that there is an inverse correlation between the expression of HDAC10 and MMP2 or MMP9 (Fig. 3, G and H) in cervical cancer patients. HDAC10 contains one DAC domain in the N-terminal region and one catalytically inactive LRD in the C-terminal region (Fig. 4A) (21.Tong J.J. Liu J. Bertos N.R. Yang X.J. Identification of HDAC10, a novel class II human histone deacetylase containing a leucine-rich domain.Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the histone deacetylase activity is required for its regulation of MMP2 and -9 expression, we used PCR to generate two plasmids, each of which encodes either the DAC domain or the LRD (Fig. 4B). Real time PCR and Western blotting showed that the DAC domain, but not the LRD, can mimic the effects of full-length HDAC10 on regulating the mRNA level of MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1, and TIMP2 (Fig. 4, C–F) and the protein level of these genes (Fig. 4, G and H), suggesting that the histone deacetylase activity of HDAC10 is required in this process. Because the HDAC10-mediated suppression of MMP2 and -9 transcription requires its histone deacetylase domain (Fig. 4, C and D), we hypothesized that HDAC10 might interact with the promoter regions of MMP2 and -9 and alter the acetylation level of histone in these regions, resulting in suppression of MMP2 and -9 expression. To test this hypothesis, we first used a ChIP assay to investigate whether HDAC10 binds to the MMP2 and MMP9 promoter regions. The primers used in the ChIP assay were designed according to the binding site of transcriptional factors in these regions (27.Chernov A.V. Sounni N.E. Remacle A.G. Strongin A.Y.

These serum proteins include vitellogenins, which are egg yolk precursors and pathogen pattern recognition receptors, and apolipoprotein B, which is an anti-inflammatory cholesterol carrier. In the honey bee, vitellogenin acts as an antioxidant, and elevated vitellogenin titer is linked to prolonged life span in this animal. Here, we show that vitellogenin has cell and membrane binding activity and that it binds preferentially to dead and damaged cells. Vitellogenin binds directly to phosphatidylcholine liposomes and with higher affinity to liposomes containing phosphatidylserine, a lipid of the inner leaflet of cell membranes that is exposed in damaged cells. Vitellogenin binding to live cells, furthermore, improves cell oxidative stress tolerance. This study can shed more light on why large lipid transfer proteins have a well conserved α-helical domain, because we locate the lipid bilayer-binding ability of vitellogenin largely to this region. We suggest that recognition of cell damage and oxidation shield properties are two mechanisms that allow vitellogenin to extend honey bee life span."
https://openalex.org/W2034934091,"Background Overweight and obesity in adulthood are established risk factors for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but the contribution of overweight in childhood to later cardiovascular risk is less clear. Evidence for a direct effect of childhood overweight would highlight early life as an important target for cardiovascular disease prevention. The aim of this study was to assess whether overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence contribute to excess cardiovascular risk in adults. Methods and findings Data from three British birth cohorts, born in 1946, 1958 and 1970, were pooled for analysis (n = 11,447). Individuals were categorised, based on body mass index (BMI), as being of normal weight or overweight/obese in childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Eight patterns of overweight were defined according to weight status at these three stages. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess the associations of patterns of overweight with self-reported type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart disease (CHD) in adulthood (34–53 years). Compared to cohort members who were never overweight, those who were obese in adulthood had increased risk of all outcomes. For type 2 diabetes, the odds ratio was higher for obese adults who were also overweight or obese in childhood and adolescence (OR 12.6; 95% CI 6.6 to 24.0) than for those who were obese in adulthood only (OR 5.5; 95% CI 3.4 to 8.8). There was no such effect of child or adolescent overweight on hypertension. For CHD, there was weak evidence of increased risk among those with overweight in childhood. The main limitations of this study concern the use of self-reported outcomes and the generalisability of findings to contemporary child populations. Conclusions Type 2 diabetes and to a lesser extent CHD risk may be affected by overweight at all stages of life, while hypertension risk is associated more strongly with weight status in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2032464837,"Hedgehog signaling pathway activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of NASH. Despite this concept, hedgehog pathway inhibitors have not been explored. Thus, we examined the effect of vismodegib, a hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitor, in a diet-induced model of NASH. C57BL/6 mice were placed on 3-month chow or FFC (high saturated fats, fructose, and cholesterol) diet. One week prior to sacrifice, mice were treated with vismodegib or vehicle. Mice fed the FFC diet developed significant steatosis, which was unchanged by vismodegib therapy. In contrast, vismodegib significantly attenuated FFC-induced liver injury as manifested by reduced serum ALT and hepatic TUNEL-positive cells. In line with the decreased apoptosis, vismodegib prevented FFC-induced strong upregulation of death receptor DR5 and its ligand TRAIL. In addition, FFC-fed mice, but not chow-fed animals, underwent significant liver injury and apoptosis following treatment with a DR5 agonist; however, this injury was prevented by pre-treatment with vismodegib. Consistent with a reduction in liver injury, vismodegib normalized FFC-induced markers of inflammation including mRNA for TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and a variety of macrophage markers. Furthermore, vismodegib in FFC-fed mice abrogated indices of hepatic fibrogenesis. In conclusion, inhibition of hedgehog signaling with vismodegib appears to reduce TRAIL-mediated liver injury in a nutrient excess model of NASH, thereby attenuating hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. We speculate that hedgehog signaling inhibition may be salutary in human NASH."
https://openalex.org/W1987974483,"Extracellular adenosine, a key regulator of physiology and immune cell function that is found at elevated levels in neonatal blood, is generated by phosphohydrolysis of adenine nucleotides released from cells and catabolized by deamination to inosine. Generation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) in blood is driven by cell-associated enzymes, whereas conversion of AMP to adenosine is largely mediated by soluble enzymes. The identities of the enzymes responsible for these activities in whole blood of neonates have been defined in this study and contrasted to adult blood. We demonstrate that soluble 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) mediate conversion of AMP to adenosine, whereas soluble adenosine deaminase (ADA) catabolizes adenosine to inosine. Newborn blood plasma demonstrates substantially higher adenosine-generating 5'-NT and AP activity and lower adenosine-metabolizing ADA activity than adult plasma. In addition to a role in soluble purine metabolism, abundant AP expressed on the surface of circulating neonatal neutrophils is the dominant AMPase on these cells. Plasma samples from infant observational cohorts reveal a relative plasma ADA deficiency at birth, followed by a gradual maturation of plasma ADA through infancy. The robust adenosine-generating capacity of neonates appears functionally relevant because supplementation with AMP inhibited whereas selective pharmacologic inhibition of 5'-NT enhanced Toll-like receptor-mediated TNF-α production in neonatal whole blood. Overall, we have characterized previously unrecognized age-dependent expression patterns of plasma purine-metabolizing enzymes that result in elevated plasma concentrations of anti-inflammatory adenosine in newborns. Targeted manipulation of purine-metabolizing enzymes may benefit this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W2070249223,"Mechanosensitive channels are detected in all cells and are speculated to play a key role in many functions including osmoregulation, growth, hearing, balance, and touch. In prokaryotic cells, a direct gating of mechanosensitive channels by membrane tension was clearly demonstrated because the purified channels could be functionally reconstituted in a lipid bilayer. No such evidence has been presented yet in the case of mechanosensitive channels from animal cells. TREK-1, a two-pore domain K(+) channel, was the first animal mechanosensitive channel identified at the molecular level. It is the target of a large variety of agents such as volatile anesthetics, neuroprotective agents, and antidepressants. We have produced the mouse TREK-1 in yeast, purified it, and reconstituted the protein in giant liposomes amenable to patch clamp recording. The protein exhibited the expected electrophysiological properties in terms of kinetics, selectivity, and pharmacology. Negative pressure (suction) applied through the pipette had no effect on the channel, but positive pressure could completely and reversibly close the channel. Our interpretation of these data is that the intrinsic tension in the lipid bilayer is sufficient to maximally activate the channel, which can be closed upon modification of the tension. These results indicate that TREK-1 is directly sensitive to membrane tension."
https://openalex.org/W1977056770,"Defective clearance of apoptotic cells is frequently associated with perpetuation of inflammatory conditions. Our results show a rapid activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) in macrophages upon exposure to apoptotic cells or lysophosphatidylcholine, a specific phospholipid that is produced and released from dying cells. AMPK activation resulted from inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP production and further depended on Ca2+ mobilization and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation. Once activated, AMPK increased microtubule synthesis and chemokinesis and provided adaptation to energy demand during tracking and engulfment. Uptake of apoptotic cells was increased in lungs of mice that received lysophosphatidylcholine. Furthermore, inhibition of AMPK diminished clearance of apoptotic thymocytes in vitro and in dexamethasone-treated mice.

There are several specialized receptors, such as phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells or TAM family (MER or Tyro3) receptors on phagocytes that are responsible for binding to apoptotic cells. In addition, bridging molecules, including MFG-E8 or GAS6, facilitate docking of apoptotic cells to macrophages (9.Hanayama R. Tanaka M. Miwa K. Shinohara A. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Identification of a factor that links apoptotic cells to phagocytes.Nature. 2002; 417: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). However, less is known about the regulatory mechanisms that affect the ability of macrophages to find apoptotic cells. For example, activation of the G-coupled receptors G2A, P2Y2, S1P-R, or CX3R have recently been proposed to initiate the migration of macrophages toward dying cells (3.Nagata S. Hanayama R. Kawane K.

AMP-activated protein kinase is an important sensor of energy status and regulator of metabolism at the cellular and organism level. AMPK is a heterotrimeric enzyme consisting of two regulatory β and γ and one catalytic α subunit.

In the second step, such conformational changes make the α subunit available for Thr-172 phosphorylation by upstream kinases, including liver kinase B1 (LKB) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) (17.Hardie D.G.

Cytoskeletal reorganization induced by AMPK-dependent effects on actin and tubulin dynamics has been proposed recently as a relevant mechanism for the enhancement of cell migration and efferocytosis. For example, AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of CLIP-170 increases the rate of microtubule formation in epithelial cells and in macrophages (23.Bae H.B. Zmijewski J.W. Deshane J.S. Tadie J.M.

Interestingly, the regulation of the AMPK pathway is intimately linked to cellular bioenergetics, and it has also been shown that lyso-PC-dependent cell signaling involves the production of mitochondrial ROS (29.Watanabe N.

On the basis of these data, we hypothesized that mitochondrial function plays a key role in the signaling pathways controlling efferocytosis.

Antibodies to AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). β-Actin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. α-tubulin antibody and PKH26 were from Sigma-Aldrich. FITC-conjugated anti-CD11b was from BD Biosciences. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), rotenone, antimycin A, and thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Emulsion oil solution containing DAPI was from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA), and Hoechst dye and JC-1 were from Invitrogen. HEMA3 was from Fisher Scientific (Kalamazoo, MI). Peritoneal macrophages were collected 4 days after intraperitoneal injection of 4% Brewer thioglycollate and seeded on plates in RPMI 1640 medium. After 2 h, the plates were washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium to remove non-adherent cells. Macrophages were further cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (FBS 5%) and used for experiments within 5 days. Macrophages were incubated with specific siRNA (1 μm) to AMPKα1, as described previously (23.Bae H.B. Zmijewski J.W. Deshane J.S. Tadie J.M. Chaplin D.D. Takashima S. Abraham E. AMP-activated protein kinase enhances the phagocytic ability of macrophages and neutrophils.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 4358-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 105/well) in 12-well plates were incubated in Accell medium (serum-free) containing scrambled siRNA (1 μm) or to AMPKα1 for 72 h. Cells were then subjected to AMPK Western blot analysis or trans-well migration assay. The bioenergetics of macrophages was determined using the XF24 analyzer from Seahorse Bioscience, which measures O2 consumption and proton production (pH) in intact cells, as performed previously (30.Dranka B.P. Benavides G.A. Diers A.R. Giordano S. Zelickson B.R. Reily C. Zou L. Chatham J.C. Hill B.G. Zhang J. Landar A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Assessing bioenergetic function in response to oxidative stress by metabolic profiling.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 51: 1621-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In particular, the O2 consumption rate (OCR) is correlated with oxidative phosphorylation, and proton production (extracellular acidification rate) can be related to glycolysis. Measurements were performed using macrophages (2 × 106) that were plated on XF24 plates, after which they were treated with the compounds of interest. The plate was then washed with XF assay buffer (DMEM, 5% FBS supplemented with 5.5 mm, D-glucose, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm pyruvate (pH 7.4)) and incubated in XF buffer for 30–60 min before the assay. After the assay, the cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and protein concentration was determined by DC Lowry assay. All results were corrected to protein levels in individual wells. A trans-well migration assay was performed using 24-well cell plate BD FalconTM cell culture inserts with 8.0-μm pore size of the membrane matrix (translucent polyethylene terephthalate membrane, BD Biosciences). Briefly, peritoneal macrophages or Raw 264.7 cells (106 cells/well) in 300 μl of DMEM (8% FBS) were added to the upper chamber, whereas lyso-PC (0 or 50 μm) in culture medium was placed in the lower reservoir. The migration assay was conducted for 2.5 or 5 h. Next, cells were scraped off from the upper side of the membrane, whereas cells remaining on the lower membrane surface were stained with HEMA3 and then subjected to microscopy. The cell number was determined by a blinded observer by counting for eight to 10 fields on the lower side of the membrane. Bright light images were acquired using a Leica microscope (magnification ×20, Leica Microsystems Inc.). In selected experiments, cells were preincubated with compound C (20 μm), NAC (20 mm), or anti-G2A antibody (5 mg/ml) for 30 min before inclusion of the cells into the upper chamber. The intracellular level of superoxide generation by macrophages was measured using mitoSOX or a dichlorofluorescein-diacetate probe in conjunction with confocal microscopy, as described previously (29.Watanabe N.

Each experiment was carried out two or more times using peritoneal macrophages obtained from separate groups of mice. Peritoneal macrophages were seeded in a 4-well chambered coverslip until 70–80% confluent. The cells were treated with lyso-PC (0 or 50 μm) for 60 min. JC-1 dye (10 μm) in RPMI medium was added to the cell culture for 60 min. Microscopy was performed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (model LSM 710 confocal microscope, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Jena, Germany). Images and three-dimensional graphs that show fluorescent intensity were processed using IPLab Spectrum. In additional experiments, mitochondrial membrane potential was also measured using the JC-1 probe in conjunction with flow cytometry (35.Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Rabinowich H.

Cells were subsequently incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 4 min. Next, cells were incubated with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h, followed by the addition of α-tubulin-specific antibody for 60 min and then fluorescent anti-mouse antibody (Alexa Fluor 555) for an additional 60 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, cells were mounted with emulsion oil solution containing DAPI to visualize the nuclei. Microscopy was performed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (model LSM 710 confocal microscope, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) provided by the high-resolution imaging facility at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. An in vitro scratch assay was performed as described previously, with minor modifications (36.Huang Q.Q. Hossain M.M. Wu K. Parai K. Pope R.M. Jin J.P.

Isolated peritoneal macrophages were cultured in DMEM (5% FBS) and plates (60 mm) at 4 × 106 cells/well to allow for high-density cell adhesion. After 2 h of incubation, floating cells were removed, and adherent cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. The cell monolayer (∼85% confluent) was scratched with a thin pipette tip, and then images were acquired using a phase-contrast microscope (magnification ×5, Leica Microsystems Inc.). Macrophage motility was determined using video microscopy as described previously (28.Nakano A. Kato H. Watanabe T. Min K.D. Yamazaki S. Asano Y. Seguchi O. Higo S. Shintani Y. Asanuma H. Asakura M.

In brief, peritoneal macrophages were cultured in coverglass-bottomed wells that were placed in a humid, CO2- and temperature-controlled chamber (Pathology Devices, Inc., Westminster, MD). Images were acquired using time-lapse, phase-contrast microscopy (magnification ×10, Nikon Eclipse Ti). The subsequent images were taken with 10-min intervals for a total of 1.5 h and after inclusion of compound C (20 μm) for an additional 1.5 h. Cell velocity was determined using NIS Element software (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY). A series of time-lapse images were converted to video format.

https://openalex.org/W1985056244,"Ligand-induced ubiquitylation of EGF receptor (EGFR) is an important regulatory mechanism that controls endocytic trafficking of the receptor and its signaling potential. Here we report that tetraspanin CD82/KAI1 specifically suppresses ubiquitylation of EGFR after stimulation with heparin-binding EGF or amphiregulin and alters the rate of recruitment of the activated receptor to EEA1-positive endosomes. The suppressive effect of CD82 is dependent on the heparin-binding domain of the ligand. Deletion of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of CD82 (CD82ΔC mutant) inhibits endocytic trafficking of the tetraspanin and compromises its activity toward heparin-binding EGF-activated EGFR. Reduced ubiquitylation of EGFR is accompanied by PKC-dependent increase in serine phosphorylation of c-Cbl in cells expressing elevated levels of CD82. Furthermore, phosphorylation of threonine 654 (PKC phosphorylation site) in the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is considerably increased in CD82-expressing cells. These results describe previously unsuspected links between tetraspanin proteins and ubiquitylation of their molecular partners (e.g., EGFR). Our data identify CD82 as a new regulator of c-Cbl, which discriminatively controls the activity of this E3 ubiquitin ligase toward heparin-binding ligand-EGFR pairs. Taken together, these observations provide an important new insight into the modulatory role of CD82 in endocytic trafficking of EGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1978199907,"Photosynthetic CO2 assimilation is the carbon source for plant anabolism, including amino acid production and protein synthesis. The biosynthesis of leaf proteins is known for decades to correlate with photosynthetic activity but the mechanisms controlling this effect are not documented. The cornerstone of the regulation of protein synthesis is believed to be translation initiation, which involves multiple phosphorylation events in Eukaryotes. We took advantage of phosphoproteomic methods applied to Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes harvested under controlled photosynthetic gas-exchange conditions to characterize the phosphorylation pattern of ribosomal proteins (RPs) and eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). The analyses detected 14 and 11 new RP and eIF phosphorylation sites, respectively, revealed significant CO2-dependent and/or light/dark phosphorylation patterns and showed concerted changes in 13 eIF phosphorylation sites and 9 ribosomal phosphorylation sites. In addition to the well-recognized role of the ribosomal small subunit protein RPS6, our data indicate the involvement of eIF3, eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4G and eIF5 phosphorylation in controlling translation initiation when photosynthesis varies. The response of protein biosynthesis to the photosynthetic input thus appears to be the result of a complex regulation network involving both stimulating (e.g. RPS6, eIF4B phosphorylation) and inhibiting (e.g. eIF4G phosphorylation) molecular events."
https://openalex.org/W1988206115,"Trypanosoma brucei is the causing agent of African trypanosomiasis. These parasites possess a unique thiol redox system required for DNA synthesis and defense against oxidative stress. It includes trypanothione and trypanothione reductase (TryR) instead of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems of mammalian hosts. Here, we show that the benzisothiazolone compound ebsulfur (EbS), a sulfur analogue of ebselen, is a potent inhibitor of T. brucei growth with a favorable selectivity index over mammalian cells. EbS inhibited the TryR activity and decreased non-protein thiol levels in cultured parasites. The inhibition of TryR by EbS was irreversible and NADPH-dependent. EbS formed a complex with TryR and caused oxidation and inactivation of the enzyme. EbS was more toxic for T. brucei than for Trypanosoma cruzi, probably due to lower levels of TryR and trypanothione in T. brucei. Furthermore, inhibition of TryR produced high intracellular reactive oxygen species. Hydrogen peroxide, known to be constitutively high in T. brucei, enhanced the EbS inhibition of TryR. The elevation of reactive oxygen species production in parasites caused by EbS induced a programmed cell death. Soluble EbS analogues were synthesized and cured T. brucei brucei infection in mice when used together with nifurtimox. Altogether, EbS and EbS analogues disrupt the trypanothione system, hampering the defense against oxidative stress. Thus, EbS is a promising lead for development of drugs against African trypanosomiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2051155897,"Shank/ProSAP proteins are major scaffold proteins of the postsynaptic density; mutations in the human SHANK3 gene are associated with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorders. We have analyzed the functional relevance of several SHANK3 missense mutations affecting the N-terminal portion of the protein by expression of wild-type and mutant Shank3 in cultured neurons and by binding assays in heterologous cells. Postsynaptic targeting of recombinant Shank3 was unaltered. In electrophysiological experiments, both wild-type and L68P mutant forms of Shank3 were equally effective in restoring synaptic function after knockdown of endogenous Shank3. We observed that several mutations affected binding to interaction partners of the Shank3 ankyrin repeat region. One of these mutations, L68P, improved binding to both ligands. Leu-68 is located N-terminal to the ankyrin repeats, in a highly conserved region that we identify here as a novel domain termed the Shank/ProSAP N-terminal (SPN) domain. We show that the SPN domain interacts with the ankyrin repeats in an intramolecular manner, thereby restricting access of either Sharpin or α-fodrin. The L68P mutation disrupts this blockade, thus exposing the Shank3 ankyrin repeat region to its ligands. Our data identify a new type of regulation of Shank proteins and suggest that mutations in the SHANK3 gene do not necessarily induce a loss of function, but may represent a gain of function with respect to specific interaction partners."
https://openalex.org/W2123117858,"Earlier we identified wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) chromosome 3A as a major determinant of grain yield and its component traits. In the present study, a high-density genetic linkage map of 81 chromosome 3A-specific markers was developed to increase the precision of previously identified yield component QTLs, and to map QTLs for biomass-related traits. Many of the previously identified QTLs for yield and its component traits were confirmed and were localized to narrower intervals. Four novel QTLs one each for shoot biomass (Xcfa2262-Xbcd366), total biomass (wPt2740-Xcfa2076), kernels/spike (KPS) (Xwmc664-Xbarc67), and Pseudocercosporella induced lodging (PsIL) were also detected. The major QTLs identified for grain yield (GY), KPS, grain volume weight (GVWT) and spikes per square meter (SPSM) respectively explained 23.2%, 24.2%, 20.5% and 20.2% of the phenotypic variation. Comparison of the genetic map with the integrated physical map allowed estimation of recombination frequency in the regions of interest and suggested that QTLs for grain yield detected in the marker intervals Xcdo549-Xbarc310 and Xpsp3047-Xbarc356 reside in the high-recombination regions, thus should be amenable to map-based cloning. On the other hand, QTLs for KPS and SPSM flanked by markers Xwmc664 and Xwmc489 mapped in the low-recombination region thus are not suitable for map-based cloning. Comparisons with the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomic DNA sequence identified 11 candidate genes (CGs) for yield and yield related QTLs of which chromosomal location of two (CKX2 and GID2-like) was confirmed using wheat aneuploids. This study provides necessary information to perform high-resolution mapping for map-based cloning and for CG-based cloning of yield QTLs."
https://openalex.org/W2065071616,"Prion diseases are characterized by tissue accumulation of a misfolded, β-sheet-enriched isoform (scrapie prion protein (PrP(Sc))) of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). At variance with PrP(C), PrP(Sc) shows a partial resistance to protease digestion and forms highly aggregated and detergent-insoluble polymers, two properties that have been consistently used to distinguish the two proteins. In recent years, however, the idea that PrP(Sc) itself comprises heterogeneous species has grown. Most importantly, a putative proteinase K (PK)-sensitive form of PrP(Sc) (sPrP(Sc)) is being increasingly investigated for its possible role in prion infectivity, neurotoxicity, and strain variability. The study of sPrP(Sc), however, remains technically challenging because of the need of separating it from PrP(C) without using proteases. In this study, we have systematically analyzed both PK resistance and the aggregation state of purified PrP(Sc) across the whole spectrum of the currently characterized human prion strains. The results show that PrP(Sc) isolates manifest significant strain-specific differences in their PK digestion profile that are only partially explained by differences in the size of aggregates, suggesting that other factors, likely acting on PrP(Sc) aggregate stability, determine its resistance to proteolysis. Fully protease-sensitive low molecular weight aggregates were detected in all isolates but in a limited proportion of the overall PrP(Sc) (i.e. <10%), arguing against a significant role of slowly sedimenting PK-sensitive PrP(Sc) in the biogenesis of prion strains. Finally, we highlight the limitations of current operational definitions of sPrP(Sc) and of the quantitative analytical measurements that are not based on the isolation of a fully PK-sensitive PrP(Sc) form."
https://openalex.org/W2056712012,"The cuticle of certain insect body parts can be hardened by the addition of metals, and because niche separation may require morphological adaptations, inclusion of such metals may be linked to life history traits. Here, we analysed the distribution and enrichment of metals in the mandibles and ovipositors of a large family of gall-inducing wasps (Cynipidae, or Gall-Wasps) (plus one gall-inducing Chalcidoidea), and their associated wasps (gall-parasitoids and gall-inquilines) (Cynipidae, Chalcidoidea and Ichneumonoidea). Both plant types/organs where galls are induced, as well as galls themselves, vary considerably in hardness, thus making this group of wasps an ideal model to test if substrate hardness can predict metal enrichment. Non-galler, parasitic Cynipoidea attacking unconcealed hosts were used as ecological “outgroup”. With varying occurrence and concentration, Zn, Mn and Cu were detected in mandibles and ovipositors of the studied species. Zn tends be exclusively concentrated at the distal parts of the organs, while Mn and Cu showed a linear increase from the proximal to the distal parts of the organs. In general, we found that most of species having metal-enriched ovipositors (independently of metal type and concentration) were gall-invaders. Among gall-inducers, metals in the ovipositors were more likely to be found in species inducing galls in woody plants. Overall, a clear positive effect of substrate hardness on metal concentration was detected for all the three metals. Phylogenetic relationships among species, as suggested by the most recent estimates, seemed to have a weak role in explaining metal variation. On the other hand, no relationships were found between substrate hardness or gall-association type and concentration of metals in mandibles. We suggest that ecological pressures related to oviposition were sufficiently strong to drive changes in ovipositor elemental structure in these gall-associated Hymenoptera."
https://openalex.org/W2074996957,"Cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are critical protein kinases in regulating cell cycle progression. Among them, cyclin D1/Cdk4 exerts its function mainly in the G1 phase. By using the tandem affinity purification tag approach, we identified a set of proteins interacting with Cdk4, including NDR1/2. Interestingly, confirming the interactions between NDR1/2 and cyclin D1/Cdk4, we observed that NDR1/2 interacted with cyclin D1 independent of Cdk4, but NDR1/2 and cyclin D1/Cdk4 did not phosphorylate each other. In addition, we found that NDR1/2 did not affect the kinase activity of cyclin D1/Cdk4 upon phosphorylation of GST-Rb. However, cyclin D1 but not Cdk4 promoted the kinase activity of NDR1/2. We also demonstrated that cyclin D1 K112E, which could not bind Cdk4, enhanced the kinase activity of NDR1/2. To test whether cyclin D1 promotes G1/S transition though enhancing NDR1/2 kinase activity, we performed flow cytometry analysis using cyclin D1 and cyclin D1 K112E Tet-On inducible cell lines. The data show that both cyclin D1 and cyclin D1 K112E promoted G1/S transition. Importantly, knockdown of NDR1/2 almost completely abolished the function of cyclin D1 K112E in promoting G1/S transition. Consistently, we found that the protein level of p21 was reduced in cells overexpressing cyclin D1 K112E but not when NDR1/2 was knocked down. Taken together, these results reveal a novel function of cyclin D1 in promoting cell cycle progression by enhancing NDR kinase activity independent of Cdk4."

https://openalex.org/W1995000618,"Adipocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy in obesity can lead to many changes in adipose tissue, such as hypoxia, metabolic dysregulation, and enhanced secretion of cytokines. In this study, hypoxia increased the expression of Wnt10b in both human and mouse adipogenic cells, but not in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α-deficient adipogenic cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that HIF-2α, but not HIF-1α, bound to the Wnt10b enhancer region as well as upstream of the Wnt1 gene, which is encoded by an antisense strand of the Wnt10b gene. Hypoxia-conditioned medium (H-CM) induced phosphorylation of lipoprotein-receptor-related protein 6 as well as β-catenin-dependent gene expression in normoxic cells, which suggests that H-CM contains canonical Wnt signals. Furthermore, adipogenesis of both human mesenchymal stem cells and mouse preadipocytes was inhibited by H-CM even under normoxic conditions. These results suggest that O2 concentration gradients influence the formation of Wnt ligand gradients, which are involved in the regulation of pluripotency, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1998121268,"Asperger syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental condition within the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) characterized by specific difficulties in social interaction, communication and behavioural control. In recent years, it has been suggested that ASD is related to a dysfunction of action simulation processes, but studies employing imitation or action observation tasks provided mixed results. Here, we addressed action simulation processes in adolescents with AS by means of a motor imagery task, the classical hand laterality task (to decide whether a rotated hand image is left or right); mental rotation of letters was also evaluated. As a specific marker of action simulation in hand rotation, we assessed the so-called biomechanical effect, that is the advantage for judging hand pictures showing physically comfortable versus physically awkward positions. We found the biomechanical effect in typically-developing participants but not in participants with AS. Overall performance on both hand laterality and letter rotation tasks, instead, did not differ in the two groups. These findings demonstrated a specific alteration of motor imagery skills in AS. We suggest that impaired mental simulation and imitation of goal-less movements in ASD could be related to shared cognitive mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2029770050,"An eight-amino acid segment is known to be responsible for the marked difference in the rates of degradation of the EGF receptor (ErbB1) and ErbB2 upon treatment of cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. We have scrambled the first six amino acids of this segment of the EGF receptor (EGFR), which lies in close association with the ATP binding cleft and the dimerization face. Scrambling these six amino acids markedly reduces EGFR stability, EGF-stimulated receptor dimerization, and autophosphorylation activity. Two peptides were synthesized as follows: one containing the wild-type sequence of the eight-amino acid segment, which we call Disruptin; and one with the scrambled sequence. Disruptin inhibits Hsp90 binding to the EGFR and causes slow degradation of the EGFR in two EGFR-dependent cancer cell lines, whereas the scrambled peptide is inactive. This effect is specific for EGFR versus other Hsp90 client proteins. In the presence of EGF, Disruptin, but not the scrambled peptide, inhibits EGFR dimerization and causes rapid degradation of the EGFR. In contrast to the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, Disruptin inhibits cancer cell growth by a nonapoptotic mechanism. Disruptin provides proof of concept for the development of a new class of anti-tumor drugs that specifically cause EGFR degradation.Background: An eight-amino acid segment lying within the αC-β4 loop region of many protein kinases determines sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors.Results: A peptide comprised of this segment of the EGFR inhibits both Hsp90 binding and EGF-dependent EGFR dimerization.Conclusion: The peptide selectively degrades EGFR versus other Hsp90 clients.Significance: This peptide represents a unique approach to the therapy of EGFR-driven tumors.

Disruptin inhibits Hsp90 binding to the EGFR and causes slow degradation of the EGFR in two EGFR-dependent cancer cell lines, whereas the scrambled peptide is inactive. This effect is specific for EGFR versus other Hsp90 client proteins. In the presence of EGF, Disruptin, but not the scrambled peptide, inhibits EGFR dimerization and causes rapid degradation of the EGFR. In contrast to the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, Disruptin inhibits cancer cell growth by a nonapoptotic mechanism. Disruptin provides proof of concept for the development of a new class of anti-tumor drugs that specifically cause EGFR degradation. Background: An eight-amino acid segment lying within the αC-β4 loop region of many protein kinases determines sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors. Results: A peptide comprised of this segment of the EGFR inhibits both Hsp90 binding and EGF-dependent EGFR dimerization. Conclusion: The peptide selectively degrades EGFR versus other Hsp90 clients. Significance: This peptide represents a unique approach to the therapy of EGFR-driven tumors.

https://openalex.org/W1988536788,"The biology of the malignant plasma cells (PCs) in multiple myeloma (MM) is highly influenced by the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in which they reside. More specifically, BM stromal cells (SCs) are known to interact with MM cells to promote MM cell survival and proliferation. By contrast, it is unclear if innate immune cells within this same space also actively participate in the pathology of MM. Our study shows for the first time that eosinophils (Eos) can contribute to the biology of MM by enhancing the proliferation of some malignant PCs. We first demonstrate that PCs and Eos can be found in close proximity in the BM. In culture, Eos were found to augment MM cell proliferation that is predominantly mediated through a soluble factor(s). Fractionation of cell-free supernatants and neutralization studies demonstrated that this activity is independent of Eos-derived microparticles and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), respectively. Using a multicellular in vitro system designed to resemble the native MM niche, SCs and Eos were shown to have non-redundant roles in their support of MM cell growth. Whereas SCs induce MM cell proliferation predominantly through the secretion of IL-6, Eos stimulate growth of these malignant cells via an IL-6-independent mechanism. Taken together, our study demonstrates for the first time a role for Eos in the pathology of MM and suggests that therapeutic strategies targeting these cells may be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W1994099538,"Glia maturation factor (GMF) is a member of the actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family. ADF/cofilin promotes disassembly of aged actin filaments, whereas GMF interacts specifically with Arp2/3 complex at branch junctions and promotes debranching. A distinguishing feature of ADF/cofilin is that it binds tighter to ADP-bound than to ATP-bound monomeric or filamentous actin. The interaction is also regulated by phosphorylation at Ser-3 of mammalian cofilin, which inhibits binding to actin. However, it is unknown whether these two factors play a role in the interaction of GMF with Arp2/3 complex. Here we show using isothermal titration calorimetry that mammalian GMF has very low affinity for ATP-bound Arp2/3 complex but binds ADP-bound Arp2/3 complex with 0.7 μM affinity. The phosphomimetic mutation S2E in GMF inhibits this interaction. GMF does not bind monomeric ATP- or ADP-actin, confirming its specificity for Arp2/3 complex. We further show that mammalian Arp2/3 complex nucleation activated by the WCA region of the nucleation-promoting factor N-WASP is not affected by GMF, whereas nucleation activated by the WCA region of WAVE2 is slightly inhibited at high GMF concentrations. Together, the results suggest that GMF functions by a mechanism similar to that of other ADF/cofilin family members, displaying a preference for ADP-Arp2/3 complex and undergoing inhibition by phosphorylation of a serine residue near the N terminus. Arp2/3 complex nucleation occurs in the ATP state, and nucleotide hydrolysis promotes debranching, suggesting that the higher affinity of GMF for ADP-Arp2/3 complex plays a physiological role by promoting debranching of aged branch junctions without interfering with Arp2/3 complex nucleation."
https://openalex.org/W2054060824,"Background Non-hormonal contraception methods have been widely used, but their effects on colonization by vaginal lactobacilli remain unclear. Objective To determine the association between non-hormonal contraception methods and vaginal lactobacilli on women’s reproductive health. Methods The cross-sectional study included 164 healthy women between 18–45 years of age. The subjects were divided into different groups on the basis of the different non-hormonal contraception methods used by them. At the postmenstrual visit (day 21 or 22 of the menstrual cycle), vaginal swabs were collected for determination of Nugent score, quantitative culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of vaginal lactobacilli. The prevalence, colony counts and 16S rRNA gene expression of the Lactobacillus strains were compared between the different groups by Chi-square and ANOVA statistical analysis methods. Results A Nugent score of 0–3 was more common in the condom group (93.1%) than in the group that used an interuterine device(IUD) (75.4%), (p = 0.005). The prevalence of H2O2-producing Lactobacillus was significantly higher in the condom group (82.3%) than in the IUD group (68.2%), (p = 0.016). There was a significant difference in colony count (mean ± standard error (SE), log10colony forming unit (CFU)/ml) of H2O2-producing Lactobacillus between condom users (7.81±0.14) and IUD users (6.54±0.14), (p = 0.000). The 16S rRNA gene expression (mean ± SE, log10copies/ml) of Lactobacillus crispatus was significantly higher in the condom group (8.09±0.16) than in the IUD group (6.03±0.18), (p = 0.000). Conclusion Consistent condom use increases the colonization of Lactobacillus crispatus in the vagina and may protect against both bacterial vaginosis (BV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)."
https://openalex.org/W2018887860,"There is considerable evidence from our lab and others for a functional link between β-adrenergic receptor and insulin receptor signaling pathways in retina. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this link may contribute to lesions similar to diabetic retinopathy in that the loss of adrenergic input observed in diabetic retinopathy may disrupt normal anti-apoptotic insulin signaling, leading to retinal cell death. Our studies included assessment of neural retina function (ERG), vascular degeneration, and Müller glial cells (which express only β1 and β2-adrenergic receptor subtypes). In the current study, we produced β2-adrenergic receptor knockout mice to examine this deletion on retinal neurons and vasculature, and to identify specific pathways through which β2-adrenergic receptor modulates insulin signaling. As predicted from our hypothesis, β2-adrenergic receptor knockout mice display certain features similar to diabetic retinopathy. In addition, loss of β2-adrenergic input resulted in an increase in TNFα, a key inhibitor of insulin receptor signaling. Increased TNFα may be associated with insulin-dependent production of the anti-apoptotic factor, Akt. Since the effects occurred in vivo under normal glucose conditions, we postulate that aspects of the diabetic retinopathy phenotype might be triggered by loss of β2-adrenergic receptor signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2050580841,"Seagrass meadows play an important role in marine ecosystems. A part of seagrass production is also exported to adjacent coastal terrestrial systems, possibly influencing their functioning. In this work we experimentally analyzed the effect of Posidonia oceanica beach-cast on plant germination, growth, and nutrient uptake of two plant species (Cakile maritima and Elymus farctus) that grow on upper beaches and fore dunes along the Mediterranean coasts. We compared plants growing in simple sand (control) with those growing in a substrate enriched with P. oceanica wrack (treatment) in laboratory. P. oceanica wrack doubled the N substrate pool and kept the substrate humid. Plants growing in the treated substrate grew faster, were twice as large as those growing in the control substrate, while tissues were enriched in N and P (Cakile by the 1.3 fold in N and 2.5 fold in P; Elymus by 1.5 fold in N and 2 fold in P). Our results suggest a positive effect of seagrass litter for the enhancing of dune species, highlighting its role for the conservation of coastal dune ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2018469625,"Mitochondrial-encoded Cox1p, one of the three core subunits of yeast cytochrome oxidase (COX), was previously shown to associate with regulatory proteins and nuclear-encoded subunits into five high molecular weight complexes that were proposed to constitute the pathway for biogenesis of the Cox1p assembly module. One of the intermediates (D5) was inferred, but not directly shown to exist. In the present study mitochondria of strains expressing C-terminal-tagged subunits of COX that had not been looked at previously were pulse-labeled and analyzed for the presence of newly translated Cox1p in the immunoprecipitates. These studies revealed that of the eight nuclear-encoded COX subunits, only Cox5ap, Cox6p, and Cox8p are present in the Cox1p module. Both Cox5ap and Cox8p share interfaces with Cox1p in the holoenzyme, whereas Cox6p interacts indirectly through Cox5ap. These results suggest that the subunit contacts in the holoenzyme are probably established during biogenesis of the Cox1p module. To confirm the existence of the largest Cox1p intermediates (D5), which was only inferred previously, radiolabeled Cox1p with a C-terminal tag was expressed in COX-deficient pet111 and pet494 mutants. Pulldown assays confirmed the presence of newly translated Cox1p in D5, which in wild type cannot be demonstrated directly because of its co-migration with COX in the native electrophoresis system used to separate the intermediates.

Conclusion: The composition of the Cox1p module reflects the subunit interactions in the holoenzyme. Significance: Cytochrome oxidase is assembled from several rather than a single linear pathway. Cytochrome oxidase (COX) is the terminal complex of mitochondrial and bacterial respiratory chains. The catalytic core of COX consists of Cox1p, Cox2p, and Cox3p, which are products of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in fungi and animal mitochondria (1Barrientos A. Barros M.H. Valnot I. Rötig A. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Cytochrome oxidase in health and disease.Gene. 2002; 286: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition to the core subunits, the mitochondrial enzyme contains eight other subunits that are absent in bacteria. This group of proteins is encoded in nuclear DNA, translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes, and routed to the appropriate mitochondrial compartments. Although the functions of the latter proteins are not known, studies in yeast indicate that with a few exceptions, they are required for assembly and stability of an optimally active enzyme (2McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. Nuclear functions required for cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Characterization of mutants in 34 complementation groups.J. Biol.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the rate of Cox1p translation is adjusted to its utilization during assembly of the holoenzyme (4Barrientos A. Zambrano A. Tzagoloff A.

Inventory control. Cytochrome c oxidase assembly regulates mitochondrial translation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The regulation depends on several accessory proteins. Foremost is Mss51p, a Cox1p-specific translational activator that interacts not only with the COX1 mRNA to initiate translation but also with the protein product itself (8Perez-Martinez X. Broadley S.A. Fox T.D. Mss51p promotes mitochondrial Cox1p synthesis and interacts with newly synthesized Cox1p.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The Cox14p-Coa3p complex and Coa1p also play important roles in translational regulation by stabilizing the Cox1p-Mss51p interaction (4Barrientos A. Zambrano A. Tzagoloff A.

Tzagoloff A. Stabilization of Cox1p intermediates by the Cox14p-Coa3p complex.FEBS Lett. 2013; 587: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Sequestration of Mss51p in this complex prevents it from exercising its function as a translational activator of the mRNA until it is released during recruitment of Cox1p for COX assembly. Five assembly intermediates (D1-D5) have been detected by immunoprecipitation of tagged Cox1p from digitonin extracts of yeast mitochondria pulse-labeled in vitro with radioactive amino acids (12McStay G.P. Su C.H. Tzagoloff A. Modular assembly of yeast cytochrome oxidase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The complexes differ both in size and abundance and in pulse-chase experiments display a precursor-product relationship with COX. Several approaches have been used to study the compositions of Cox1p intermediates (6Fontanesi F. Soto I.C. Horn D. Barrientos A.

Based on pulse-chase analysis of the intermediates in isolated mitochondria, we proposed that COX is assembled from three different modules, each containing one of the core proteins with its own unique complement of nuclear-encoded subunits and/or regulatory/assembly factors (12McStay G.P. Su C.H. Tzagoloff A. Modular assembly of yeast cytochrome oxidase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The present studies were undertaken to answer several questions related to the Cox1p assembly module. The first was to determine if in addition to Cox5ap and Cox6p, this module contained other nuclear-encoded subunits for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the relationship between the composition of the Cox1p intermediate(s) and the known subunit contacts Cox1p makes in the holoenzyme. Second, we examined if the mutation in these subunits affected the steady-state distribution of Cox1p in the different Cox1p intermediates. Last, we sought to obtain additional evidence for the existence of the largest Cox1p intermediate (D5), which was inferred to exist but was not demonstrated directly in the prior study (12McStay G.P.

Mitochondria were labeled with a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (3000 Ci/mmol, MP Biochemicals, Solon, OH) (19Rak M. Gokova S. Tzagoloff A. Modular assembly of yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and tagged proteins were extracted and purified on protein C antibody beads (Roche Applied Sciences) as described previously (12McStay G.P.

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on different concentrations of polyacrylamide gels in the buffer system described by Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar).

Schägger H. Blue native PAGE.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). The second dimension in SDS-PAGE was run on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Western blots were treated with antibodies against the appropriate proteins followed by a second reaction with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Proteins were detected with the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L.

Yeast expressing a subset of COX subunits and assembly factors tagged at their C termini with HA followed by the protein C epitope were previously used to examine the compositions of different Cox1p intermediates (12McStay G.P. Su C.H. Tzagoloff A. Modular assembly of yeast cytochrome oxidase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The intermediates were analyzed by native gel electrophoresis of the tagged proteins immuno-adsorbed from digitonin extracts of isolated mitochondria labeled in organello with radioactive amino acids. The same approach was used in this study to analyze Cox1p intermediates for the presence of Cox8p, the only nuclear-encoded subunit other than Cox5ap in direct contact with Cox1p in the holoenzyme (26Tsukihara T.

W303/COX8-HAC, a cox8 null mutant harboring a chromosomally integrated copy of COX8-HAC, was verified to express Cox8p with a C-terminal HAC tag and, based on its growth on rich glycerol/ethanol, in-gel enzyme activity, and spectra of mitochondrial cytochromes, to contain normal amounts of COX (Fig. 1, A–D). Mitochondria of this strain were labeled with [35S]methionine plus cysteine. After extraction with digitonin, Cox8p-HAC was purified on protein C antibody beads. The same protocol was used with mitochondria expressing Cox1p-HAC in the respiratory-competent haploid strain MRSIo/COX1-HAC and in the cox8 mutant aW303ΔCOX8/COX1-HAC. Labeled mitochondrial gene products associated with Cox8p-HAC and Cox1p-HAC in the fractions eluted from the antibody beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by BN-PAGE. The eluates from mitochondria with either tagged Cox8p or Cox1p were enriched for newly translated Cox1p, Cox2p, and Cox3p (Fig. 2A). The one-dimensional BN-PAGE showed the expected radiolabeled intermediates D1-D5 in the eluates from the two strains with double-tagged Cox1p-HAC (Fig. 2B). The two-dimensional gels of the eluates from these strains were very similar except that there was less newly translated Cox3p in COX and the supercomplex bands of the cox8 null mutant, indicating reduced COX assembly (Fig. 2C). This is consistent with the growth property, the in-gel COX assay, and the cytochrome spectrum of mitochondria of this strain (Fig. 1, A, C, and D). The decrease of COX in the cox8 null mutant suggests that C-terminal modification of Cox1p renders it less assembly-competent in the absence of Cox8p or reduces the stability of the holoenzyme.FIGURE 2Cox8p is a component of the Cox1p module. A, mitochondria were prepared from the wild type W303-1B and the respiratory competent haploid strains MRSIo/COX1-HAC and W303/COX8-HAC expressing, respectively, Cox1p and Cox8p with C-terminal HAC tags and from the cox8 null mutant aW303ΔCOX8/COX1-HAC harboring mtDNA with COX1-HAC. Mitochondria were labeled for 20 min as described under “Materials and Methods,” and samples of the digitonin extracts and the fraction eluted from the protein C antibody beads (PC eluate) were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 17% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to x-ray film. The radiolabeled mitochondrial gene products are identified in the margins. B, the protein C eluates obtained in A were separated by BN-PAGE on a 4–13% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and exposed to x-ray film. The bands corresponding to the supercomplexes, COX, and the D1-D5 Cox1p intermediates identified previously (12McStay G.P. Su C.H. Tzagoloff A. Modular assembly of yeast cytochrome oxidase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) are indicated in the margin. C, the protein C antibody eluates obtained in A were separated in the first dimension as in B. A slice of the gel containing the separated proteins was equilibrated with stacking gel buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), layered on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and separated by SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and exposed to x-ray film. The radiolabeled bands separated under native conditions are identified above the gels and in the denaturing gel on the left margins. As discussed previously, the non-stoichiometric incorporation of newly radiolabeled Cox1p into the supercomplexes is probably a consequence of dilution by the large steady-state concentrations of unlabeled Cox1p intermediates present in mitochondria (12McStay G.P.

Variables associated with hospital mortality were selected using logistic regressions. Based on the regression coefficients, a score for each PIRO component was developed and a classification tree was used to stratify patients into four stages of increased risk of hospital mortality. The final clinical staging system was then validated using an independent cohort (n = 186).Factors significantly associated with hospital mortality were • for Predisposition: age, sex, previous antibiotic therapy, chronic hepatic disease, chronic hematologic disease, cancer, atherosclerosis and a Karnofsky index<70; • for Insult/Infection: type of infection • forabnormal temperature, tachypnea, hyperglycemia and severity of infection and • for Organ dysfunction: hypotension and SOFA score≥1. The area under the ROC curve (CI95%) for the combined PIRO model as a predictor for mortality was 0.85 (0.82-0.88). Based on the scores for each of the PIRO components and on the cut-offs estimated from the classification tree, patients were stratified into four stages of increased mortality rates: stage I: ≤5%, stage II: 6-20%, stage III: 21-50% and stage IV: >50%. Finally, this new clinical staging system was studied in a validation cohort, which provided similar results (0%, 9%, 31% and 67%, in each stage, respectively).Based on the PIRO concept, a new clinical staging system was developed for hospitalized patients with infection, allowing stratification into four stages of increased mortality, using the different scores obtained in Predisposition, RESPONSE, Infection and Organ dysfunction. The proposed system will likely help to define inclusion criteria in clinical trials as well as tailoring individual management plans for patients with infection."
https://openalex.org/W2030341901,"Marine ecosystem is a complex nonlinear system. However, ecosystem health assessment conventionally builds on a linear superposition of changes in ecosystem components and probably fails to evaluate nonlinear interactions among various components. To better reflect the intrinsic interactions and their impacts on ecosystem health, an ecosystem coordination index, defined as the matching level of ecosystem structure/services, is proposed and incorporated into the ecosystem health index for a systematic diagnosis in the Pearl River Estuary, China. The analysis results show that the ecosystem health index over the last three decades decreased from 0.91 to 0.50, indicating deteriorating from healthy to unhealthy status. The health index is 3–16% lower than that calculated using the common method without considering ecosystem coordination. Ecosystem health degradation in the Pearl River Estuary manifested as significant decreases in structure/services and somewhat mismatching among them. Overall, the introduction of coordination in ecosystem health assessment could improve the understanding of the mechanism of marine ecosystem change and facilitate effective restoration of ecosystem health."
https://openalex.org/W2040677394,"T cell antigen receptor γδ (TCRγδ) and natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) are two crucial receptors for γδT cell cytotoxicity. Compelling evidences suggest that γδT cell cytotoxicity is TCRγδ-dependent and can be co-stimulated by NKG2D. However, the molecular mechanism of underlying TCRγδ-dependent activation of γδT cells remains unclear. In this study we demonstrated that TCRγδ but not NKG2D engagement induced lytic granule polarization and promoted γδT cell cytotoxicity. TCRγδ activation alone was sufficient to trigger Vav1-dependent phospholipase C-γ1 signaling, resulting in lytic granule polarization and effective killing, whereas NKG2D engagement alone failed to trigger cytotoxicity-related signaling to overcome the inhibitory effect of Cbl-b; therefore, NKG2D engagement alone could not induce effective killing. However, NKG2D ligation augmented the activation of γδT cell cytotoxicity through the Vav1-phospholipase C-γ1 pathway. Vav1 overexpression or Cbl-b knockdown not only enhanced TCRγδ activation-initiated killing but also enabled NKG2D activation alone to induce γδT cell cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results suggest that the activation of γδT cell cytotoxicity requires a strong activation signal to overcome the inhibitory effect of Cbl-b. Our finding provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of γδT cell cytotoxicity and likely implications for optimizing γδT cell-based cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2114485302,"The piggyBac transposon is one of the most attractive nonviral tools for mammalian genome manipulations. Given that piggybac mobilizes in a “cut-and-paste” fashion, integrant remobilization could potentially damage the host genome. Here, we report a novel piggyBac transposon system with a series of recombinant transposases. We found that the transposition activity of wild-type (PBase) and hyperactive (hyPBase) piggyBac transposases can be significantly increased by peptide fusions in a cell-type dependent fashion, with the greatest change typically seen in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The two most potent recombinant transposases, TPLGMH and ThyPLGMH, give a 9- and 7-fold increase, respectively, in the number of integrants in HEK293 compared with Myc-tagged PBase (MycPBase), and both display 4-fold increase in generating induced pluripotential stem cells. Interestingly, ThyPLGMH but not TPLGMH shows improved chromosomal excision activity (2.5-fold). This unique feature of TPLGMH provides the first evidence that integration activity of a transposase can be drastically improved without increasing its remobilization activity. Transposition catalyzed by ThyPLGMH is more random and occurs further from CpG islands than that catalyzed by MycPBase or TPLGMH. Our transposon system diversifies the mammalian genetic toolbox and provides a spectrum of piggyBac transposases that is better suited to different experimental purposes.—Meir, Y.-J.

https://openalex.org/W1964076310,"The toxic role of amyloid β peptides in Alzheimer's disease is well documented. Their generation is via sequential β- and γ-secretase cleavage of the membrane-bound amyloid precursor protein (APP). Other APP metabolites include the soluble ectodomains sAPPα and sAPPβ and also the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD). In this study, we examined whether APP is involved in the regulation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is a key protein of the cholinergic system and has been shown to accelerate amyloid fibril formation and increase their toxicity. Overexpression of the neuronal specific isoform, APP695, in the neuronal cell lines SN56 and SH-SY5Y substantially decreased levels of AChE mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity. Although similar decreases in mRNA levels were observed of the proline-rich anchor of AChE, PRiMA, no changes were seen in mRNA levels of the related enzyme, butyryl-cholinesterase, nor of the high-affinity choline transporter. A γ-secretase inhibitor did not affect AChE transcript levels or enzyme activity in SN56 (APP695) or SH-SY5Y (APP695) cells, showing that regulation of AChE by APP does not require the generation of AICD or amyloid β peptide. Treatment of wild-type SN56 cells with siRNA targeting APP resulted in a significant up-regulation in AChE mRNA levels. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the observed transcriptional repression of AChE is mediated by the E1 region of APP, specifically its copper-binding domain, but not the C-terminal YENTPY motif. In conclusion, AChE is regulated in two neuronal cell lines by APP in a manner independent of the generation of sAPPα, sAPPβ, and AICD."
https://openalex.org/W1980653064,"A recent genome-wide SNP association study identified IRF4 as a major susceptibility gene for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Moreover, the SNPs located in the 3' UTR of the IRF4 gene have been linked to a down-regulation of IRF4. However, whether a low level of IRF4 is critical for CLL development remains unclear. New Zealand Black (NZB) mice are a naturally occurring, late-onset mouse model of CLL. To examine the role of a reduced level of IRF4 in CLL development, we generated, through breeding, IRF4 heterozygous mutant mice in the NZB background (NZB IRF4(+/-)). Our results show that CLL development is accelerated dramatically in the NZB IRF4(+/-) mice. The average onset of CLL in NZB mice is 12 months, but CLL cells can be detected in NZB IRF4(+/-) mice at 3 months of age. By 5 months of age, 80% of NZB IRF4(+/-) mice developed CLL. CLL cells are derived from B1 cells in mice. Interestingly, NZB IRF4(+/-) B1 cells exhibit prolonged survival, accelerated self-renewal, and defects in differentiation. Although NZB IRF4(+/-) CLL cells are resistant to apoptosis, high levels of IRF4 inhibit their survival. High levels of IRF4 also reduce the survival of MEC-1 human CLL cells. Our analysis further reveals that high levels of IRF4 suppress Akt activity and can do so without the IRF4 DNA binding domain. Thus, our findings reveal a causal relationship between a low level of IRF4 and the development of CLL and establish IRF4 as a novel regulator in the pathogenesis of CLL."
https://openalex.org/W2013978920,"Although alterations in stimulus-induced degradation of PKC have been implicated in disease, mechanistic understanding of this process remains limited. Evidence supports the existence of both proteasomal and lysosomal mechanisms of PKC processing. An established pathway involves rate-limiting priming site dephosphorylation of the activated enzyme and proteasomal clearance of the dephosphorylated protein. However, here we show that agonists promote down-regulation of endogenous PKCα with minimal accumulation of a nonphosphorylated species in multiple cell types. Furthermore, proteasome and lysosome inhibitors predominantly protect fully phosphorylated PKCα, pointing to this form as a substrate for degradation. Failure to detect substantive dephosphorylation of activated PKCα was not due to rephosphorylation because inhibition of Hsp70/Hsc70, which is required for re-priming, had only a minor effect on agonist-induced accumulation of nonphosphorylated protein. Thus, PKC degradation can occur in the absence of dephosphorylation. Further analysis revealed novel functions for Hsp70/Hsc70 and Hsp90 in the control of agonist-induced PKCα processing. These chaperones help to maintain phosphorylation of activated PKCα but have opposing effects on degradation of the phosphorylated protein; Hsp90 is protective, whereas Hsp70/Hsc70 activity is required for proteasomal processing of this species. Notably, down-regulation of nonphosphorylated PKCα shows little Hsp70/Hsc70 dependence, arguing that phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated species are differentially targeted for proteasomal degradation. Finally, lysosomal processing of activated PKCα is not regulated by phosphorylation or Hsps. Collectively, these data demonstrate that phosphorylated PKCα is a direct target for agonist-induced proteasomal degradation via an Hsp-regulated mechanism, and highlight the existence of a novel pathway of PKC desensitization in cells."

https://openalex.org/W2084619511,"Most rivers worldwide are highly regulated by anthropogenic activities through flow regulation and water pollution. Environmental flow regulation is used to reduce the effects of anthropogenic activities on aquatic ecosystems. Formulating flow alteration-ecological response relationships is a key factor in environmental flow assessment. Traditional environmental flow models are characterized by natural relationships between flow regimes and ecosystem factors. However, food webs are often altered from natural states, which disturb environmental flow assessment in such ecosystems. In ecosystems deteriorated by heavy anthropogenic activities, the effects of environmental flow regulation on species are difficult to assess with current modeling approaches. Environmental flow management compels the development of tools that link flow regimes and food webs in an ecosystem. Food web approaches are more suitable for the task because they are more adaptive for disordered multiple species in a food web deteriorated by anthropogenic activities. This paper presents a global method of environmental flow assessment in deteriorated aquatic ecosystems. Linkages between flow regimes and food web dynamics are modeled by incorporating multiple species into an ecosystem to explore ecosystem-based environmental flow management. The approach allows scientists and water resources managers to analyze environmental flows in deteriorated ecosystems in an ecosystem-based way."
https://openalex.org/W2140856698,"Four different type IV secretion systems are variously represented in the genomes of different Helicobacter pylori strains. Two of these, encoded by tfs3 and tfs4 gene clusters are contained within self-transmissible genomic islands. Although chromosomal excision of tfs4 circular intermediates is reported to be dependent upon the function of a tfs4-encoded XerD tyrosine-like recombinase, other factors required for transfer to a recipient cell have not been demonstrated. Here, we characterize the functional activity of a putative tfs4-encoded VirD2-like relaxase protein. Tfs4 VirD2 was purified as a fusion to maltose-binding protein and demonstrated to bind and nick both supercoiled duplex DNA and oligonucleotides in vitro in a manner dependent upon the presence of Mg(2+) but independently of any auxiliary proteins. Unusually, concentration-dependent nicking of duplex DNA appeared to require only transient protein-DNA interaction. Although phylogenetically distinct from established relaxase families, site-specific cleavage of oligonucleotides by Tfs4 VirD2 required the nick region sequence 5'-ATCCTG-3' common to transfer origins (oriT) recognized by MOBP conjugative relaxases. Cleavage resulted in covalent attachment of MBP-VirD2 to the 5'-cleaved end, consistent with conventional relaxase activity. Identification of an oriT-like sequence upstream of tfs4 virD2 and demonstration of VirD2 protein-protein interaction with a putative VirC1 relaxosome component indicate that transfer initiation of the tfs4 genomic island is analogous to mechanisms underlying mobilization of other integrated mobile elements, such as integrating conjugative elements, requiring site-specific targeting of relaxase activity to a cognate oriT sequence."

Myocardially-derived vascular endothelial growth factor-a (Vegfa) regulates embryonic coronary angiogenesis through vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor 2 (Vegfr2) expressed in the endocardium. In this study, we investigated the role of endocardially-produced soluble Vegfr1 (sVegfr1) in the coronary angiogenesis. We deleted sVegfr1 in the endocardium of the developing mouse heart and found that this deletion resulted in a precocious formation of coronary plexuses. Using an ex vivo coronary angiogenesis assay, we showed that the Vegfr1-null ventricular endocardial cells underwent excessive angiogenesis and generated extensive endothelial tubular networks. We also revealed by qPCR analysis that expression of genes involved in the Vegf-Notch pathway was augmented in the Vegfr1-null hearts. We further showed that inhibition of Notch signaling blocked the formation of coronary plexuses by the ventricular endocardial cells. These results establish that Vegfr1 produced in the endocardium negatively regulates embryonic coronary angiogenesis, possibly by limiting the Vegf-Notch signaling."

In the present study the secretome of alginate-encapsulated limbal epithelial stem cells is investigated. Conditioned medium was generated from limbal epithelial stem cells encapsulated in 1.2% (w/v) calcium alginate gels. Conditioned medium proteins separated by 1-D gel electrophoresis were visualized by silver staining. Proteins of interest including secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, profilin-1, and galectin-1 were identified by immunoblotting. The effect of conditioned medium (from alginate-encapsulated limbal epithelial stem cells) on corneal epithelial cell proliferation was quantified and shown to significantly inhibit (P≤0.05) their growth. As secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine was previously reported to attenuate proliferation of epithelial cells, this protein may be responsible, at least in part, for inhibition of corneal epithelial cell proliferation. We conclude that limbal epithelial stem cells encapsulated in alginate gels may regulate corneal epithelialisation through secretion of inhibitory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2047575295,"In Escherichia coli and the majority of β- and γ-proteobacteria, the fourth step of lipid A biosynthesis, i.e. cleavage of the pyrophosphate group of UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN, is carried out by LpxH. LpxH has been previously suggested to contain signature motifs found in the calcineurin-like phosphoesterase (CLP) family of metalloenzymes; however, it cleaves a pyrophosphate bond instead of a phosphoester bond, and its substrate contains nucleoside diphosphate moieties more common to the Nudix family rather than to the CLP family. Furthermore, the extent of biochemical data fails to demonstrate a significant level of metal activation in enzymatic assays, which is inconsistent with the behavior of a metalloenzyme. Here, we report cloning, purification, and detailed enzymatic characterization of Haemophilus influenzae LpxH (HiLpxH). HiLpxH shows over 600-fold stimulation of hydrolase activity in the presence of Mn(2+). EPR studies reveal the presence of a Mn(2+) cluster in LpxH. Finally, point mutants of residues in the conserved metal-binding motifs of the CLP family greatly inhibit HiLpxH activity, highlighting their importance in enzyme function. Contrary to previous analyses of LpxH, we find HiLpxH does not obey surface dilution kinetics. Overall, our work unambiguously establishes LpxH as a calcineurin-like phosphoesterase containing a Mn(2+) cluster coordinated by conserved residues. These results set the scene for further structural investigation of the enzyme and for design of novel antibiotics targeting lipid A biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2082288472,"The production of chemicals from renewable resources is gaining importance in the light of limited fossil resources. One promising alternative to widespread fermentation based methods used here is Synthetic Cascade Biomanufacturing, the application of minimized biocatalytic reaction cascades in cell free processes. One recent example is the development of the phosphorylation independent conversion of glucose to ethanol and isobutanol using only 6 and 8 enzymes, respectively. A key enzyme for this pathway is aldehyde dehydrogenase from Thermoplasma acidophilum, which catalyzes the highly substrate specific oxidation of d-glyceraldehyde to d-glycerate. In this work the enzyme was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Using matrix-assisted refolding of inclusion bodies the yield of enzyme production was enhanced 43-fold and thus for the first time the enzyme was provided in substantial amounts. Characterization of structural stability verified correct refolding of the protein. The stability of the enzyme was determined by guanidinium chloride as well as isobutanol induced denaturation to be ca. −8 kJ/mol both at 25°C and 40°C. The aldehyde dehydrogenase is active at high temperatures and in the presence of small amounts of organic solvents. In contrast to previous publications, the enzyme was found to accept NAD+ as cofactor making it suitable for application in the artificial glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1967244246,"Phosphorylation of Ser-639 in loop-2 of the catalytic motor domain of the heavy chain of Acanthamoeba castellanii myosin-2 and the phosphomimetic mutation S639D have been shown previously to down-regulate the actin-activated ATPase activity of both the full-length myosin and single-headed subfragment-1 (Liu, X., Lee, D. Y., Cai, S., Yu, S., Shu, S., Levine, R. L., and Korn, E. D. (2013) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 110, E23–E32). In the present study we determined the kinetic constants for each step in the myosin and actomyosin ATPase cycles of recombinant wild-type S1 and S1-S639D. The kinetic parameter predominantly affected by the S639D mutation is the actin-activated release of inorganic phosphate from the acto myosin·ADP·Pi complex, which is the rate-limiting step in the steady-state actomyosin ATPase cycle. As consequence of this change, the duty ratio of this conventional myosin decreases. We speculate on the effect of Ser-639 phosphorylation on the processive behavior of myosin-2 filaments.Background: Actin-activated ATPase activity of Acanthamoeba myosin-2 is inhibited by phosphorylation of Ser-639.Results: Kinetic constants for each step of the ATPase cycle were determined for wild-type myosin and the phosphomimetic mutant S639D.Conclusion: Ser-639 phosphorylation reduces actin-activated phosphate-release and hence the steady-state ATPase activity of the myosin.Significance: This is the first example of regulation of a myosin by covalent modification of loop-2.

Conclusion: Ser-639 phosphorylation reduces actin-activated phosphate-release and hence the steady-state ATPase activity of the myosin. Significance: This is the first example of regulation of a myosin by covalent modification of loop-2. Cytoplasmic myosin-2 (AM2) 2The abbreviations used are: AM2, A. castellanii myosin-2; mant, N-methylanthraniloyl; d-mant, deoxy-mant; MDCC-PiBP, MDCC-labeled PiBP, N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide-labeled phosphate-binding protein; S1, subfragment-1; AM, actomyosin; M, myosin. is the only filament forming myosin in the model system Acanthamoeba castellanii. As an actin-based molecular motor, AM2 generates retraction forces that are indispensable for cell mechanics and directed cell migration. At the molecular level, AM2 has the classical composition of a conventional myosin consisting of two heavy chains and two sets of light chains (1Maruta H. Korn E.D. Acanthamoeba myosin II.J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6501-6509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pollard T.D. Stafford W.F. Porter M.E. Characterization of a second myosin from Acanthamoeba castellanii.J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4798-4808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heavy chain is subdivided into an N-terminal motor domain that communicates the allosteric interaction between ATP hydrolysis and F-actin binding, an intermediate neck region that non-covalently associates with one set of light chains, and an α-helical tail domain that terminates in a short non-helical tailpiece. Structural studies showed that, as for other class-2 myosins, the tail domains of two adjacent heavy chains form a coiled-coil and the hexameric myosin holoenzyme self-assembles into higher-order arrays (3Pollard T.D.

In vivo, myosin filaments undergo dynamic assembly/disassembly transitioning from octameric minifilaments to thick filaments and vice versa in a spatiotemporal manner (5Kong H.H. Pollard T.D.

In contrast to eukaryotic muscle and nonmuscle myosin-2s, filament assembly and actin-activated ATPase activity of AM2 are regulated by phosphorylation of heavy chain serines (6Liu X. Lee D.Y. Cai S.

Furthermore, phosphorylation of Ser-639 also inhibits the activity of recombinant single-headed subfragment-1 (S1), and the recombinant phosphomimetic S1 mutant, S639D, has similarly low actin-activated ATPase activity (6Liu X. Lee D.Y. Cai S. Yu S. Shu S. Levine R.L. Korn E.D. Regulation of the actin-activated MgATPase activity of Acanthamoeba myosin II by phosphorylation of serine 639 in motor domain loop 2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E23-E32Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To determine which kinetic step of the myosin catalytic cycle (Scheme 1) is affected by Ser-639 phosphorylation, we have now determined all accessible rate and equilibrium constants of recombinant wild-type (WT) S1 and the phosphomimetic mutant S639D. Comparative analysis reveals that the S639D mutation reduces the rate of phosphate release from the actomyosin·ADP·Pi complex, the rate-limiting step in the steady-state ATPase cycle, thereby impacting the overall kinetic behavior and the duty ratio of the myosin molecule. Standard chemicals were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 2′-Deoxy-mant nucleotides were from BioLog. Recombinant WT and S639D AM2 S1s comprising heavy chain residues 1–900 and the two AM2 light chains were overproduced in Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) insect cells and purified to homogeneity via FLAG affinity chromatography as described previously (6Liu X.

For the transient kinetic studies, apyrase treatment (0.1 units/ml) of F-actin was carried out to ensure rigor conditions when required. Steady-state ATPase assays were conducted at 30 °C with the radiometric ATPase assay, as described previously, in buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.12 μm S1 (6Liu X.

Stopped-flow assays were conducted at 20 °C in a SF-61DX2 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Hi-Tech Scientific) equipped with a 75-watt mercury-xenon arc lamp in buffer containing 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 unless stated otherwise. Intrinsic protein fluorescence was excited at 297 nm, and the emission at 348 nm was monitored through a WG320 long-pass filter. 2′-Deoxy-mant-derivatives of ATP and ADP (d-mantATP or d-mantADP) were directly exited at 365 nm or via energy transfer from intrinsic tryptophan residues (excitation at 297 nm), and the emitted light at 446 nm was monitored after passage through a 390-nm long-pass filter. Pyrene was excited at 365 nm, and the emitted light at 407 nm was monitored through a 390-nm long-pass filter. Changes in light scattering were monitored at 90° to the incident light by using an excitation wavelength of 320 or 420 nm. F-actin binding assays were carried out at a myosin:F-actin molar ratio of 1:5 to 1:7.5 in assay buffer containing 2.5 mm KCl. The same buffer was used for F-actin release assays. Phosphate release assays were conducted with the fluorescently labeled phosphate binding protein (MDCC-PiBP) under single-turnover conditions according to the method of Brune et al. (10Brune M.

Pi contaminants were removed from solutions and the stopped-flow apparatus before the assay with Pi scavenging solution containing 0.1 units/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase and 0.1 mm 7-methylguanosine. MDCC-PiBP fluorescence was excited at 430 nm and monitored after passing a 455-nm cut-off filter. The final KCl concentration post-mixing was 25 mm, and the final MDCC-PiBP concentration 10 μm.

M refers to myosin, AM refers to actomyosin, and Pi refers to inorganic phosphate. Dissociation equilibrium constants were calculated as Kx = k−x/k+x. The steady-state ATPase activities of S1 fragments of WT and S639D were determined with the radiometric ATPase assay (6Liu X. Lee D.Y. Cai S. Yu S. Shu S. Levine R.L. Korn E.D.

F-actin efficiently activated the steady-state ATPase activity of WT ∼94-fold from a basal value of 0.05 s−1 to a calculated kcat of 4.68 ± 0.73 s−1 (Fig. 1, Table 1). The concentration of F-actin required for half-saturation of the steady-state ATPase (Kapp) was extrapolated to be 428 ± 97 μm. The addition of F-actin more weakly activated the steady-state ATPase activity of S639D in the concentration range up to 270 μm. The data shown in Fig. 1 for S639D were best described by a linear fit. At the highest concentration of F-actin used, 270 μm, S639D showed a steady-state ATPase rate of 0.77 ± 0.08 s−1. In comparison, the catalytic activity of WT at 270 μm was with 1.85 ± 0.13 s−1 around 2.5 times faster. S1 fragments of mammalian nonmuscle myosin-2A, -2B, and -2C also had a weak apparent affinity for actin, and actin titration curves did not saturate under the actin concentrations used in those studies (13Heissler S.M.

Open table in a new tab The low net charge of loop-2, +1 for WT and 0 for S639D (see “Discussion”) prompted us to repeat the steady-state ATPase assay under low salt conditions to strengthen the actomyosin interaction. When performing the assay under low ionic strength (2.5 mm KCl), the Kapp decreased for WT, whereas the calculated kcat increased (Kapp = 133 μm, kcat = 5.14 s−1). In contrast, only a slight increase in the steady-state rates of S639D was observed, and the F-actin concentration dependence of the steady-state ATPase activity of S639D remained linear with a Kapp >270 μm (data not shown). The interaction between ATP and myosin was assayed by mixing both components under pseudo-first order conditions in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The monitored time-dependent change in tryptophan fluorescence was fitted to single exponentials according to the equation I(t)=A⋅e−kobst+C(Eq. 1) For both proteins, the observed rate constants kobs depended hyperbolically on the ATP concentration (Fig. 2A). The data are described by a two-step binding reaction mechanism (Scheme 2), M + ATP⇌K1 M⋅ATP⇌k+2M*⋅ATP⇌k−3k+3M**⋅ADP⋅PiSCHEME 2 According to this model, ATP binding to myosin results in the formation of a binary collision complex, M·ATP (K1) followed by a conformational change of the protein to an intrinsically high fluorescent complex, M*·ATP (k+2), which leads to a reversible ATP hydrolysis step by M**·ADP·Pi (k+3 + k−3). ATP hydrolysis is accompanied by further enhancement of the intrinsic protein fluorescence, as indicated by the asterisks. The parameters of a hyperbolic fit to the data sets shown in Fig. 2A gave maximum values of 19.0 ± 0.5 and 19.7 ± 0.5 s−1 for WT and S639D, respectively (Table 2), which by analogy to skeletal muscle myosin-2 we propose is the maximum rate constant of ATP hydrolysis (k+3 + k−3) (12Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. Woodward S.K.

Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 2B, linear fits of the data sets up to 7.5 μm ATP define the apparent second-order rate constants, K1k+2, for ATP binding to WT and S639D as 1.33 ± 0.04 and 1.56 ± 0.07 μm−1s−1, respectively (Table 2). From the corresponding y intercepts the apparent dissociation rate constants k−2 of 1.65 ± 0.21 s−1 and 1.23 ± 0.35 s−1 were obtained for WT and S639D (Table 2). In agreement, K1k+2 values of 1.93 ± 0.02 and 1.33 ± 0.04 μm−1s−1 were obtained for WT and S639D when performing the assay with the fluorescent substrate analog d-mantATP (Fig. 2C and Table 2). A representative transient of the interaction between S639D and d-mantATP is shown in Fig. 2D. As in the presence of the substrate ATP, the obtained stopped-flow records were fitted to single exponentials according to Equation 1. ATP binding to the actoS1 complexes was conducted by rapidly mixing pyrene-actoS1 with increasing concentrations of ATP. The allosteric displacement of F-actin by ATP resulted in the dissociation of the actoS1 complex and was modeled as a two-step mechanism according to Scheme 3, A⋅M + ATP⇌K1A⋅M⋅ATP⇌k+2A+M⋅ATPSCHEME 3 This model of the second-order binding reaction describes the formation of the collision complex (K1) followed by a conformational change that results in the dissociation of the rigor complex (k+2). Experimentally, the time-dependent increase in pyrene fluorescence upon S1 detaching from F-actin resulted in single-exponential fits to the data for both WT and S639D (Fig. 3A, inset). A secondary plot of the observed rate constants kobs versus ATP concentration is depicted in Fig. 3A. For WT, the parameters of a hyperbolic fit to the data set defined a k+2 of 779.6 ± 24.9 s−1 and a 1/K1 of 651.3 ± 68.4 μm (Table 2). Similar kinetic parameters, k+2 = 645.2 ± 16 s−1 and 1/K1 = 561.3 ± 53 μm, were obtained for S639D (Table 2). Linear fit parameters of the data set up to 12.5 μm ATP defined the apparent second-order rate constants K1k+2 of 2.11 ± 0.03 μm−1s−1 and K1k+2 as 1.51 ± 0.02 μm−1s−1 for WT and S639D, respectively (Fig. 3B, Table 2). The ATP binding properties were independently confirmed by determining the interaction between d-mantATP and actomyosin (Fig. 3C). The fluorescence transients obtained upon mixing actomyosin with increasing substrate concentrations were single-exponential, as depicted in Fig. 3D. In a secondary plot the observed rate constants, kobs, showed a linear dependence on the concentration of d-mantATP. Linear fits to the data sets determined the apparent second order binding rate constants, K1k+2, of 0.73 ± 0.02 μm−1s−1 and 0.81 ± 0.01 μm−1s−1 for WT and S639D (Fig. 3C), respectively. A comparison of the determined rate constants with those from other conventional myosins is provided in Table 2. Binding of d-mantADP to WT and S639D was assayed by rapidly mixing the reactants under pseudo-first order conditions in a stopped-flow apparatus. The time-dependent changes in the fluorescence signals were fitted to single-exponentials according to Equation 1, suggesting a one-step binding mechanism (Scheme 4), M+ADP⇌k−Dk+DM⋅ADP*SCHEME 4 In this scheme the asterisk denotes the enhanced fluorescence state of d-mantADP. Plotting of the observed rate constants kobs as a function of d-mantADP concentration resulted in a linear dependence up to 12.5 μm (Fig. 4A). The parameter k+D = 0.5 ± 0.03 μm−1s−1, describing the second-order rate constant for d-mantADP binding to WT, was deduced from the slope of a fit to the data set. The ordinate intercept defined the corresponding d-mantADP dissociation rate constant k−D as 2.29 ± 0.2 s−1 (Table 2). Independently, the ADP displacement from myosin was determined directly by chasing the myosin·d-mantADP complex with excess ATP. A single-exponential fit to the fluorescence decay resulted in a k−D of 1.53 ± 0.01 s−1. A similar value (k−D of 1.68 ± 0.02 s−1) was obtained when probing the change in intrinsic fluorescence upon ATP binding to myosin·ADP (Table 2, Fig. 4B). In comparison, d-mantADP binding to S639D was around three times faster than to WT (k+D = 1.43 ± 0.17 μm−1s−1; Fig. 4A, Table 2), whereas the assayed dissociation rate constant k−D was comparable to those assayed for WT (Table 2). Calculation of the dissociation equilibrium constant for ADP binding from the corresponding binding and release rate constants (KD = k−D/k+D) gave a KD of 4.58 ± 0.49 μm for WT and 0.95 ± 0.26 μm for S639D, indicating tight ADP affinity of both proteins in the absence of F-actin. The ADP binding kinetics to actoS1 could not be assayed directly with mant-labeled ADP as neither WT nor S639D showed a change in fluorescence or FRET signal after mixing the reactants in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Therefore, the affinity of ADP for actoS1 was indirectly assayed in nucleotide competition experiments by rapidly mixing 50 μm ATP with an equilibrated mixture of pyrene-actoS1·ADP. The transient increase in pyrene-fluorescence was fitted to single-exponentials according to Equation 1. The plot of the ratio of the observed rate constants in the presence and absence of ADP kobs/k0 versus ADP concentration is shown in Fig. 5A. The solid lines are hyperbolic fits of the data sets to the following equation, kob"
https://openalex.org/W2092448879,"The striated muscle thin filament comprises actin, tropomyosin, and troponin. The Tn complex consists of three subunits, troponin C (TnC), troponin I (TnI), and troponin T (TnT). TnT may serve as a bridge between the Ca(2+) sensor (TnC) and the actin filament. In the short helix preceding the IT-arm region, H1(T2), there are known dilated cardiomyopathy-linked mutations (among them R205L). Thus we hypothesized that there is an element in this short helix that plays an important role in regulating the muscle contraction, especially in Ca(2+) activation. We mutated Arg-205 and several other amino acid residues within and near the H1(T2) helix. Utilizing an alanine replacement method to compare the effects of the mutations, the biochemical and mechanical impact on the actomyosin interaction was assessed by solution ATPase activity assay, an in vitro motility assay, and Ca(2+) binding measurements. Ca(2+) activation was markedly impaired by a point mutation of the highly conserved basic residue R205A, residing in the short helix H1(T2) of cTnT, whereas the mutations to nearby residues exhibited little effect on function. Interestingly, rigor activation was unchanged between the wild type and R205A TnT. In addition to the reduction in Ca(2+) sensitivity observed in Ca(2+) binding to the thin filament, myosin S1-ADP binding to the thin filament was significantly affected by the same mutation, which was also supported by a series of S1 concentration-dependent ATPase assays. These suggest that the R205A mutation alters function through reduction in the nature of cooperative binding of S1."
https://openalex.org/W2040716340,"PTP-PEST is a cytosolic ubiquitous protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that contains, in addition to its catalytic domain, several protein-protein interaction domains that allow it to interface with several signaling pathways. Among others, PTP-PEST is a key regulator of cellular motility and cytoskeleton dynamics. The complexity of the PTP-PEST interactome underscores the necessity to identify its interacting partners and physiological substrates in order to further understand its role in focal adhesion complex turnover and actin organization. Using a modified yeast substrate trapping two-hybrid system, we identified a cytosolic adaptor protein named Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein 55 homologue (SKAP-Hom) as a novel substrate of PTP-PEST. To confirm PTP-PEST interaction with SKAP-Hom, in vitro pull down assays were performed demonstrating that the PTP catalytic domain and Proline-rich 1 (P1) domain are respectively binding to the SKAP-Hom Y260 and Y297 residues and its SH3 domain. Subsequently, we generated and rescued SKAP-Hom-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with WT SKAP-Hom, SKAP-Hom tyrosine mutants (Y260F, Y260F/Y297F), or SKAP-Hom SH3 domain mutant (W335K). Given the role of PTP-PEST, wound-healing and trans-well migration assays were performed using the generated lines. Indeed, SKAP-Hom-deficient MEFs showed a defect in migration compared with WT-rescued MEFs. Interestingly, the SH3 domain mutant-rescued MEFs showed an enhanced cell migration corresponding potentially with higher tyrosine phosphorylation levels of SKAP-Hom.

https://openalex.org/W2087199768,"The CD40/CD40L dyad is deemed to play a central role in several inflammatory processes, including atherosclerosis. As CD40 is overexpressed in atherosclerotic lesions, it constitutes a promising candidate for targeted imaging approaches. Here we describe the design of a novel, selective peptide ligand for CD40 by phage display. A synthetic peptide corresponding with the phage insert NP31 displayed nanomolar affinity for CD40. Affinity was further enhanced by mutimeric presentation of NP31. An essential 11-mer peptide motif was identified by truncation and alanine scan studies. Enriched phage selectively bound human CD40 and homed to inflammatory joints in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis. NP31 ablated VEGF and IL-6 transcriptional activation and partially inhibited IL-6 production by CD40L-activated endothelial cells. Notably, NP31 did not only alter the biodistribution profile of a streptavidin scaffold but also markedly increased accumulation of the carrier in atherosclerotic aortic lesions of aged ApoE(-/-) mice in a CD40-dependent manner. This potent and selective peptide ligand has potential for targeted imaging and drug delivery approaches in CD40-dependent inflammatory disorders such as atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1995383665,"Background The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous regulators, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs 1–4) are responsible for the physiological remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Among all TIMPs, TIMP3 appears to play a unique role since TIMP3 is a secreted protein and, unlike the other TIMP family members, is tightly bound to the ECM. Moreover TIMP3 has been shown to be able to induce apoptotic cell death. As little is known about the underlying mechanisms, we set out to investigate the pro-apoptotic effect of TIMP3 in human mesenchymal cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Lentiviral overexpression of TIMP3 in mesenchymal cells led to a strong dose-dependent induction of ligand-independent apoptosis as reflected by a five-fold increase in caspase 3 and 7 activity compared to control (pLenti6/V5-GW/lacZ) or uninfected cells, whereas exogenous TIMP3 failed to induce apoptosis. Concordantly, increased cleavage of death substrate PARP and the caspases 3 and 7 was observed in TIMP3 overexpressing cultures. Notably, activation of caspase-8 but not caspase-9 was observed in TIMP3-overexpressing cells, indicating a death receptor-dependent mechanism. Moreover, overexpression of TIMP3 led to a further induction of apoptosis after stimulation with TNF-alpha, FasL and TRAIL. Most interestingly, TIMP3-overexpression was associated with a decrease in phosphorylation of cRaf, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk1/2), ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK1) and Akt and serum deprivation of TIMP3-overexpressing cells resulted in a distinct enhancement of apoptosis, pointing to an impaired signaling of serum-derived survival factors. Finally, heparinase treatment of heparan sulfate proteoglycans led to the release of TIMP3 from the surface of overexpressing cells and to a significant decrease in apoptosis indicating that the binding of TIMP3 is necessary for apoptosis induction. Conclusion The results demonstrate that exclusively cell surface-bound endogenous TIMP3 induces apoptosis in mesenchymal Cal78 cells through ligand-independent activation of death receptor signaling and blockade of survival signaling pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1980469155,"The DNA recombination and repair machinery of Mycoplasma pneumoniae is composed of a limited set of approximately 11 proteins. Two of these proteins were predicted to be encoded by neighboring open reading frames (ORFs) MPN340 and MPN341. Both ORFs were found to have sequence similarity with genes that encode proteins belonging to the DNA helicase superfamily 1 (SF1). Interestingly, while a homolog of the MPN341 ORF is present in the genome of Mycoplasma genitalium (ORF MG244), MPN340 is an M. pneumoniae-specific ORF that is not found in other mycoplasmas. Moreover, the length of MPN340 (1590 base pairs [bp]) is considerably shorter than that of MPN341 (2148 bp). Examination of the MPN340-encoded amino acid sequence indicated that it may lack a so-called 2B subdomain, which is found in most SF1 DNA helicases. Also, the MPN340-encoded amino acid sequence was found to differ between subtype 1 strain M129 and subtype 2 strain FH at three amino acid positions. Both protein variants, which were termed PcrA(s) M129 and PcrA(s) FH, respectively, as well as the MPN341- and MG244-encoded proteins (PcrA Mpn and PcrA Mge , respectively), were purified, and tested for their ability to interact with DNA. While PcrA Mpn and PcrA Mge were found to bind preferentially to single-stranded DNA, both PcrA(s) M129 and PcrA(s) FH did not demonstrate significant DNA binding. However, all four proteins were found to have divalent cation- and ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity. The proteins displayed highest activity on partially double-stranded DNA substrates carrying 3' single-stranded extensions."
