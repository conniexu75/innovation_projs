https://openalex.org/W3012284084,"Estimation of the prevalence and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. Here, we use observations of reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model, and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. We estimate that 86% of all infections were undocumented [95% credible interval (CI): 82-90%] before the 23 January 2020 travel restrictions. The transmission rate of undocumented infections per person was 55% the transmission rate of documented infections (95% CI: 46-62%), yet, because of their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the source of 79% of the documented cases. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate that containment of this virus will be particularly challenging."
https://openalex.org/W3012193510,"Frequently referred to as the 'magic methyl effect', the installation of methyl groups-especially adjacent (α) to heteroatoms-has been shown to dramatically increase the potency of biologically active molecules1-3. However, existing methylation methods show limited scope and have not been demonstrated in complex settings1. Here we report a regioselective and chemoselective oxidative C(sp3)-H methylation method that is compatible with late-stage functionalization of drug scaffolds and natural products. This combines a highly site-selective and chemoselective C-H hydroxylation with a mild, functional-group-tolerant methylation. Using a small-molecule manganese catalyst, Mn(CF3PDP), at low loading (at a substrate/catalyst ratio of 200) affords targeted C-H hydroxylation on heterocyclic cores, while preserving electron-neutral and electron-rich aryls. Fluorine- or Lewis-acid-assisted formation of reactive iminium or oxonium intermediates enables the use of a mildly nucleophilic organoaluminium methylating reagent that preserves other electrophilic functionalities on the substrate. We show this late-stage C(sp3)-H methylation on 41 substrates housing 16 different medicinally important cores that include electron-rich aryls, heterocycles, carbonyls and amines. Eighteen pharmacologically relevant molecules with competing sites-including drugs (for example, tedizolid) and natural products-are methylated site-selectively at the most electron rich, least sterically hindered position. We demonstrate the syntheses of two magic methyl substrates-an inverse agonist for the nuclear receptor RORc and an antagonist of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1-via late-stage methylation from the drug or its advanced precursor. We also show a remote methylation of the B-ring carbocycle of an abiraterone analogue. The ability to methylate such complex molecules at late stages will reduce synthetic effort and thereby expedite broader exploration of the magic methyl effect in pursuit of new small-molecule therapeutics and chemical probes."

Consequently, the search for a more cost-effective (reagent-free), non-invasive and specific diabetes monitoring method is of great interest. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy has been used in diagnosis of several diseases, however, applications in the monitoring of diabetic treatment are just beginning to emerge. Here, we used ATR-FTIR spectroscopy to evaluate saliva of non-diabetic (ND), diabetic (D) and insulin-treated diabetic (D+I) rats to identify potential salivary biomarkers related to glucose monitoring. The spectrum of saliva of ND, D and D+I rats displayed several unique vibrational modes and from these, two vibrational modes were pre-validated as potential diagnostic biomarkers by ROC curve analysis with significant correlation with glycemia. Compared to the ND and D+I rats, classification of D rats was achieved with a sensitivity of 100%, and an average specificity of 93.33% and 100% using bands 1452 cm-1 and 836 cm-1, respectively. Moreover, 1452 cm-1 and 836 cm-1 spectral bands proved to be robust spectral biomarkers and highly correlated with glycemia (R2 of 0.801 and 0.788, P < 0.01, respectively). Both PCA-LDA and HCA classifications achieved an accuracy of 95.2%. Spectral salivary biomarkers discovered using univariate and multivariate analysis may provide a novel robust alternative for diabetes monitoring using a non-invasive and green technology."

While previous work has surveyed specific and singular types of agricultural irrigation water for bacterial pathogens, few studies have simultaneously surveyed different water sources repeatedly over an extended period of time. This study quantified S. enterica and L. monocytogenes levels (MPN/L) at 6 sites, including river waters: tidal freshwater river (MA04, n = 34), non-tidal freshwater river, (MA05, n = 32), one reclaimed water holding pond (MA06, n = 25), two pond water sites (MA10, n = 35; MA11, n = 34), and one produce wash water site (MA12, n = 10) from September 2016-October 2018. Overall, 50% (84/168) and 31% (53/170) of sampling events recovered S. enterica and L. monocytogenes, respectively. Results showed that river waters supported significantly (p < 0.05) greater levels of S. enterica than pond or reclaimed waters. The non-tidal river water sites (MA05) with the lowest water temperature supported significantly greater level of L. monocytogenes compared to all other sites; L. monocytogenes levels were also lower in winter and spring compared to summer seasons. Filtering 10 L of water through a modified Moore swab (MMS) was 43.5 (Odds ratio, p < 0.001) and 25.5 (p < 0.001) times more likely to recover S. enterica than filtering 1 L and 0.1 L, respectively; filtering 10 L was 4.8 (p < 0.05) and 3.9 (p < 0.05) times more likely to recover L. monocytogenes than 1L and 0.1 L, respectively. Work presented here shows that S. enterica and L. monocytogenes levels are higher in river waters compared to pond or reclaimed waters in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., and quantitatively shows that analyzing 10 L water is more likely recover pathogens than smaller samples of environmental waters."
https://openalex.org/W3012102028,"3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (MPST) catalyzes the desulfuration of 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP) and transfers sulfane sulfur from an enzyme-bound persulfide intermediate to thiophilic acceptors such as thioredoxin and cysteine. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a signaling molecule implicated in many physiological processes, can be released from the persulfide product of the MPST reaction. Two splice variants of MPST, differing by 20 amino acids at the N terminus, give rise to the cytosolic MPST1 and mitochondrial MPST2 isoforms. Here, we characterized the poorly-studied MPST1 variant and demonstrated that substitutions in its Ser–His–Asp triad, proposed to serve a general acid–base role, minimally affect catalytic activity. We estimated the 3-MP concentration in murine liver, kidney, and brain tissues, finding that it ranges from 0.4 μmol·kg−1 in brain to 1.4 μmol·kg−1 in kidney. We also show that N-acetylcysteine, a widely-used antioxidant, is a poor substrate for MPST and is unlikely to function as a thiophilic acceptor. Thioredoxin exhibits substrate inhibition, increasing the KM for 3-MP ∼15-fold compared with other sulfur acceptors. Kinetic simulations at physiologically-relevant substrate concentrations predicted that the proportion of sulfur transfer to thioredoxin increases ∼3.5-fold as its concentration decreases from 10 to 1 μm, whereas the total MPST reaction rate increases ∼7-fold. The simulations also predicted that cysteine is a quantitatively-significant sulfane sulfur acceptor, revealing MPST's potential to generate low-molecular-weight persulfides. We conclude that the MPST1 and MPST2 isoforms are kinetically indistinguishable and that thioredoxin modulates the MPST-catalyzed reaction in a physiologically-relevant concentration range. 3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (MPST) catalyzes the desulfuration of 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP) and transfers sulfane sulfur from an enzyme-bound persulfide intermediate to thiophilic acceptors such as thioredoxin and cysteine.

https://openalex.org/W3011083572,"The left and right foot representation area is located within the interhemispheric fissure of the sensorimotor cortex and share spatial proximity. This makes it difficult to visualize the cortical lateralization of event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) during left and right foot motor imageries. The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of using ERD/ERS in the mu, low beta, and high beta bandwidth, during left and right foot dorsiflexion kinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI), as unilateral control commands for a brain-computer interface (BCI). EEG was recorded from nine healthy participants during cue-based left-right foot dorsiflexion KMI tasks. The features were analysed for common average and bipolar references. With each reference, mu and beta band-power features were analysed using time–frequency (TF) maps, scalp topographies, and average time course for ERD/ERS. The cortical lateralization of ERD/ERS, during left and right foot KMI, was confirmed. Statistically significant features were classified using LDA, SVM, and KNN model, and evaluated using the area under ROC curves. An increase in high beta power following the end of KMI for both tasks was recorded, from right and left hemispheres, respectively, at the vertex. The single trial analysis and classification models resulted in high discrimination accuracies, i.e. maximum 83.4% for beta ERS, 79.1% for beta ERD, and 74.0% for mu ERD. With each model the features performed above the statistical chance level of 2-class discrimination for a BCI. Our findings indicate these features can evoke left-right differences in single EEG trials. This suggests that any BCI employing unilateral foot KMI can attain classification accuracy suitable for practical implementation. Given results stipulate the novel utilization of mu and beta as independent control features for discrimination of bilateral foot KMI in a BCI."
https://openalex.org/W3011371696,"The rapid emergence and dissemination of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains poses a major threat to public health. MRSA possesses an arsenal of secreted host-damaging virulence factors that mediate pathogenicity and blunt immune defenses. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and α-toxin are exotoxins that create lytic pores in the host cell membrane. They are recognized as being important for the development of invasive MRSA infections and are thus potential targets for antivirulence therapies. Here, we report the high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of both PVL and α-toxin in their soluble, monomeric, and oligomeric membrane-inserted pore states in complex with n-tetradecylphosphocholine (C14PC). The structures revealed two evolutionarily conserved phosphatidylcholine-binding mechanisms and their roles in modulating host cell attachment, oligomer assembly, and membrane perforation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the soluble C14PC compound protects primary human immune cells in vitro against cytolysis by PVL and α-toxin and hence may serve as the basis for the development of an antivirulence agent for managing MRSA infections."
https://openalex.org/W3011766333,"To assess i) whether there is an independent association between HIV-prevalence and settlement types (urban formal, urban informal, rural formal, rural informal), and, ii) whether this changes over time, in South Africa. We draw on four (2002; 2005; 2008; 2012) cross-sectional South African household surveys. Data is analysed by sex (male/female), and for women by age categories (15-49; and 15-24; 25-49) at all-time points, for men in 2012 data is analysed by age categories (15-24; 25-49). By settlement type and sex/age combinations, we descriptively assess the association between socio-demographic and HIV-risk factors; HIV-prevalence; and trends in HIV-prevalence by time. Relative risk ratios assess unadjusted and adjusted risk for HIV-prevalence by settlement type. All estimates are weighted, and account for survey design. In all survey years, and combinations of sex/age categorisations, HIV-prevalence is highest in urban informal settlements. For men (15-49) an increasing HIV-prevalence over time in rural informal settlements was seen (p = 0.001). For women (15-49) HIV-prevalence increases over time for urban informal, rural informal, rural formal, and women (15-24) decreases in urban formal and urban informal, and women (25-49) increases urban informal and rural informal settlements. In analyses adjusting for potential socio-demographic and risk factors, compared to urban formal settlements, urban informal settlements had consistently higher relative risk of HIV for women, in all age categorisations, for instance in 2012 this was RR1.89 (1.50, 2.40) for all women (15-49), for 15-24 (RR1.79, 1.17-2.73), and women 25-49 (RR1.91, 1.47-2.48). For men, in the overall age categorization, urban informal settlements had a higher relative risk for HIV in all years. In 2012, when this was disaggregated by age, for men 15-24 rural informal (IRR2.69, 1.28-5.67), and rural formal (RR3.59, 1.49-8.64), and for men 25-49 it was urban informal settlements with the highest (RR1.68, 1.11-2.54). In 2012, rural informal settlements also had higher adjusted relative risk for HIV-prevalence for men (15-49) and women (15-49; 15-24; 25-49). In South Africa, HIV-prevalence is patterned geographically, with urban informal settlements having a particularly high burden. Geographical targeting of responses is critical for the HIV-response."
https://openalex.org/W2976455918,"Failing to mitigate propagation of disease spread can result in dire economic consequences for agricultural networks. Pathogens like Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus, can quickly spread among producers. Biosecurity is designed to prevent infection transmission. When considering biosecurity investments, management must balance the cost of protection versus the consequences of contracting an infection. Thus, an examination of the decision making processes associated with investment in biosecurity is important for enhancing system wide biosecurity. Data gathered from digital field experiments can provide insights into behavioral strategies and inform the development of decision support systems. We created an online digital experiment to simulate outbreak scenarios among swine production supply chains, where participants were tasked with making biosecurity investment decisions. In Experiment One, we quantified the risk associated with each participant's decisions and delineated three dominant categories of risk attitudes: risk averse, risk tolerant, and opportunistic. Each risk class exhibited unique approaches in reaction to risk and disease information. We also tested how information uncertainty affects risk aversion, by varying the amount of visibility of the infection as well as the amount of biosecurity implemented across the system. We found evidence that more visibility in the number of infected sites increases risk averse behaviors, while more visibility in the amount of neighboring biosecurity increased risk taking behaviors. In Experiment Two, we were surprised to find no evidence for differences in behavior of livestock specialists compared to Amazon Mechanical Turk participants. Our findings provide support for using digital field experiments to study how risk communication affects behavior, which can provide insights towards more effective messaging strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3011184144,"Introduction Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are the major killer diseases globally. They share the common risk factors such as smoking, harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity, and low fruits/vegetable consumption. The clustering of these risk factors multiplies the risk of developing NCDs. NCDs affect women inequitably causing significant threats to the health of women and future generations. But, the distribution and clustering of NCDs risk factors among Nepalese women are not adequately explored yet. This study aimed to assess the clustering and socio-demographic distribution of major NCD risk factors in Nepalese women. Methods We used the data of 6,396 women age 15 to 49 years from the recent Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). The survey applied a stratified multi-stage cluster sampling method to select the eligible women participants from across Nepal. We analyzed data using the multiple Poisson regression and reported the adjusted prevalence ratio (APR). Results A total of 8.9% of participants were current smokers, 22.2% were overweight and obesity and 11.5% of the participants were hypertensive. Around 6% of participants had co-occurrence of two NCDs risk factors. Smoking, overweight and obesity and hypertension were significantly associated with age, education, province, wealth index, and ethnicity. Risk factors were more likely to cluster in women of age40-49 years (ARR = 2.95, 95%CI: 2.58–3.38), widow/separated (ARR = 3.09; 95% CI:2.24–4.28) and among Dalit women (ARR = 1.34; 95% CI:1.17–1.55). Conclusion This study found that NCDs risk factors were disproportionately distributed by age, education, socio-economic status and ethnicity and clustered in more vulnerable groups such as widow/separated women and the Dalit women."
https://openalex.org/W3011666184,"Soil biodiversity plays a key regulation role in the ecosystem services that underpin regenerative sustainable agriculture. It can be impacted by agricultural management techniques, both positively (through measures such as compost application) and negatively (through, for example, application of synthetic nitrogen). As one of the most numerous members of the soil biota, nematodes are well established as indicators for the soil food web. However, compost application also includes the addition of nematodes present in compost and their subsequent survival in soil is unknown. Nematode communities within the compost applied to soil, and nematode communities in the soil of a multi-year rotational cropping field trial in Melle (Belgium) were studied using morphological and metabarcoding techniques. Compost (C) and nitrogen fertilizer (NF) treated plots were compared. Three replicate plots were investigated for each of the following treatments: C application only; C and NF application; NF only; no C and no NF (control). Plots were sampled six times between 2015-2017, before and after C or NF were added each spring and after crop harvest (except for 2017). NF treatment resulted in a significant decrease of fungal feeding and predatory nematodes, while herbivorous nematodes were positively affected. Remarkably, we did not find compost addition to exert any noticeable effects on the soil nematode community. The morphological and metabarcoding data resulted in different results of the nematode community composition. However, trends and patterns in the two data sets were congruent when observed with NMDS plots and using the nematode maturity index. Metabarcoding of individual compost nematode taxa demonstrated that nematodes originating from compost did not persist in soil."
https://openalex.org/W3011695199,"Traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes do not explain the increased CVD burden in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The oxidized-LDL receptor, LOX-1, is an inflammation-induced receptor implicated in atherosclerotic plaque formation in acute coronary syndrome, and here we evaluated its role in SLE-associated CVD. SLE patients have increased sLOX-1 levels which were associated with elevated proinflammatory HDL, oxLDL and hsCRP. Interestingly, increased sLOX-1 levels were associated with patients with early disease onset, low disease activity, increased IL-8, and normal complement and hematological measures. LOX-1 was increased on patient-derived monocytes and low-density granulocytes, and activation with oxLDL and immune-complexes increased membrane LOX-1, TACE activity, sLOX-1 release, proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes, and triggered the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps which can promote vascular injury. In conclusion, perturbations in the lipid content in SLE patients’ blood activate LOX-1 and promote inflammatory responses. Increased sLOX-1 levels may be an indicator of high CVD risk, and blockade of LOX-1 may provide a therapeutic opportunity for ameliorating atherosclerosis in SLE patients."
https://openalex.org/W3011022295,"Oocyte in vitro maturation can be improved by mimicking the intra-follicular environment. Oocyte, cumulus cells, granulosa cells, and circulating factors act as meiotic regulators in follicles and maintain oocyte in the meiotic phase until oocyte becomes competent and ready to be ovulated. In a randomized experimental design, an ovine model was used to optimize the standard in vitro maturation media by Granulosa secreted factors. At first, the development capacity of oocyte derived from medium (>4 to 6 mm) and small (2 to ≤4 mm) size follicles was determined. Differential gene expression of granulosa secreted factors and their receptors were compared between the cumulus cells of the two groups. Then, the best time and concentration for arresting oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage by natriuretic peptide type C (CNP) were determined by nuclear staining in both groups. Oocyte quality was further confirmed by calcein uptake and gene expression. The developmental competence of cumulus oocyte complexes derived from small size follicles that were cultured in the presence of CNP in combination with amphiregulin (AREG) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) for 24 h was determined. Finally, embryo quality was specified by assessing expressions of NANOG, SOX2, CDX2, OCT4, and TET1. The cumulus oocyte complexes derived from small size follicles had a lower capacity to form blastocyst in comparison with cumulus oocyte complexes derived from medium size follicles. Prostaglandin E receptor 2 and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 had significantly lower expression in cumulus cells derived from small size follicles in comparison with cumulus cells derived from medium size follicles. Natriuretic peptide type C increased the percentage of cumulus oocyte complexes arresting at the germinal vesicle stage in both oocytes derived from medium and small follicles. Gap junction communication was also improved in the presence of natriuretic peptide type C. In oocytes derived from small size follicles; best blastocyst rates were achieved by sequential exposure of cumulus oocyte complexes in [TCM+CNP (6 h), then cultured in TCM+AREG+PGE2 (18h)] and [TCM+CNP (6 h), then cultured in conventional IVM supplements+AREG+PGE2 (18h)]. Increased SOX2 expression was observed in [TCM+CNP (6 h), then cultured in TCM+AREG+PGE2 (18h)], while decreased OCT4 expression was observed in [TCM+CNP (6 h), then cultured in conventional IVM supplements+AREG+PGE2 (18h)]. It seems that the natriuretic peptide type C modulates meiotic progression, and oocyte development is probably mediated by amphiregulin and prostaglandin E2. These results may provide an alternative IVM method to optimize in vitro embryo production in sheep and subsequently for humans."
https://openalex.org/W3011444443,"Evidence suggests that older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) might not receive evidence-based treatments. We explored the impact of patient MCI on physician decision-making and recommendations for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a pilot concurrent mixed-methods study of physicians recruited from one academic center. The mailed survey included a clinical vignette of AIS or AMI where the patient cognitive status was randomized (normal cognition, MCI, or early-stage dementia). The primary outcome was a composite summary measure of the proportion of guideline-concordant treatments recommended. Linear regression compared the primary outcome across patient cognition groups adjusting for physician characteristics. Semi-structured interviews done with 18 physicians (4 cardiologists, 9 neurologists, 5 internists) using a standard guide. Survey response rate was 72% (82/114) (49/61 neurologists; 33/53 cardiologists). As patient cognition worsened, neurologists recommended less guideline-concordant treatments after AIS (Ptrend<0.001 across patient cognition groups). Cardiologists did not after AMI (Ptrend = 0.11) in adjusted analyses. Neurologists' recommendation of guideline-concordant treatments after AIS was non-significantly lower in patients with MCI (composite measure, 0.13 points lower; P = 0.14) and significantly lower in patients with early-stage dementia (0.33 points lower; P<0.001) compared to cognitively normal patients. Interviews identified themes that may explain these findings including physicians assumed patients with MCI, compared with cognitively normal patients, have limited life expectancy, frailty and poor functioning, prefer less treatment, might adhere less to treatment, and have greater risks or burdens from treatment. These results suggest that patient MCI influences physician decision-making and recommendations for AIS and AMI treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3011814030,"Hospitalizations for certain chronic conditions are considered avoidable for adult Canadians given effective and timely primary care management. Individual-level risk factors such as income and health behaviours are not routinely collected in most hospital databases and as a result, are largely uncharacterized for avoidable hospitalization at the national level. The aim of this study was to identify and describe demographic, socioeconomic, and health behavioural risk factors for avoidable hospitalizations in Canada using linked data. A national retrospective cohort study was conducted by pooling eight cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey (2000/2001-2011) and linking to hospitalization records in the Discharge Abstract Database (1999/2000–2012/2013). Respondents who were younger than 18 years and older than 74 years of age, residing in Quebec, or pregnant at baseline were excluded yielding a final cohort of 389,065 individuals. The primary outcome measure was time-to index avoidable hospitalization. Sex-stratified Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to determine effect sizes adjusted for various factors and their associated 95% confidence intervals. Demographics, socioeconomic status, and health behaviours are associated with risk of avoidable hospitalizations in males and females. In fully adjusted models, health behavioural variables had the largest effect sizes including heavy smoking (Male HR 2.65 (95% CI 2.17–3.23); Female HR 3.41 (2.81–4.13)) and being underweight (Male HR 1.98 (1.14–3.43); Female HR 2.78 (1.61–4.81)). Immigrant status was protective in both sexes (Male HR 0.83 (0.69–0.98); (Female HR 0.69 (0.57–0.84)). Adjustment for behavioural and clinical variables attenuated the effect of individual-level socioeconomic status. This study identified several risk factors for time-to-avoidable hospitalizations by sex, using the largest national database of linked health survey and hospitalization records. The larger effect sizes of several modifiable risk factors highlights the importance of prevention in addressing avoidable hospitalizations in Canada."
https://openalex.org/W3010766244,"Humans do not respond to the pain of all humans equally; physical appearance and associated group identity affect how people respond to the pain of others. Here we ask if a similar differential response occurs when humans evaluate different individuals of another species. Beliefs about pain in pet dogs (Canis familiaris) provide a powerful test, since dogs vary so much in size, shape, and color, and are often associated with behavioral stereotypes. Using an on-line survey, we asked both the general public and veterinarians to rate pain sensitivity in 28 different dog breeds, identified only by their pictures. We found that both the general public and veterinarians rated smaller dogs (i.e. based on height and weight) as being more sensitive to pain; the general public respondents rated breeds associated with breed specific legislation as having lower pain sensitivity. While there is currently no known physiological basis for such breed-level differences, over 90% of respondents from both groups indicated belief in differences in pain sensitivity among dog breeds. We discuss how these results inform theories of human social discrimination and suggest that the perception of breed-level differences in pain sensitivity may affect the recognition and management of painful conditions in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3011351121,"Introduction Adolescents have a higher incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) than persons of older age groups. The WHO emphasises the need to adopt specific and comprehensive prevention programmes aimed at this age group. The objective of this work was to analyse the prevalence of HIV/STIs among adolescents and to identify the sociodemographic, clinical and behavioural markers associated with these infections, in order to promote specific preventive strategies. Methodology Retrospective descriptive study of adolescents, aged 10–19 years, who were attended to for the first consultation between 2016 and 2018 in a reference STI clinic in Madrid. All adolescents were given a structured epidemiological questionnaire where information on sociodemographic, clinical and behavioural characteristics was collected. They were screened for human inmmunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The processing and analysis of the data was done using the STATA 15.0 statistical package. Results The frequency of HIV/STIs detected among all adolescents was: gonorrhoea 21.7%, chlamydia 17.1%, syphilis 4.8% and HIV 2.4%. After conducting a multivariate analysis, the independent and statistically significant variables related to the presence of an STI were having first sexual relations at a young age and having a history of STIs. Latin American origin was just below the level of statistical significance (p = 0.066). Discussion/Conclusions Adolescents who begin sexual relations at an early age or those who have a history of HIV/STIs are at higher risk of acquiring STIs. Comprehensive prevention programmes aimed specifically at adolescents should be implemented, especially before the age of 13 years."
https://openalex.org/W3012475555,"TNNI3 encoding cTnI, the inhibitory subunit of the troponin complex, is the main target for mutations leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Here we investigate two cTnI-R170G/W amino acid replacements, identified in infantile RCM patients, which are located in the regulatory C-terminus of cTnI. The C-terminus is thought to modulate the function of the inhibitory region of cTnI. Both cTnI-R170G/W strongly enhanced the Ca2+-sensitivity of skinned fibres, as is typical for RCM-mutations. Both mutants strongly enhanced the affinity of troponin (cTn) to tropomyosin compared to wildtype cTn, whereas binding to actin was either strengthened (R170G) or weakened (R170W). Furthermore, the stability of reconstituted thin filaments was reduced as revealed by electron microscopy. Filaments containing R170G/W appeared wavy and showed breaks. Decoration of filaments with myosin subfragment S1 was normal in the presence of R170W, but was irregular with R170G. Surprisingly, both mutants did not affect the Ca2+-dependent activation of reconstituted cardiac thin filaments. In the presence of the N-terminal fragment of cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBPC-C0C2) cooperativity of thin filament activation was increased only when the filaments contained wildtype cTn. No effect was observed in the presence of cTn containing R170G/W. cMyBPC-C0C2 significantly reduced binding of wildtype troponin to actin/tropomyosin, but not of both mutant cTn. Moreover, we found a direct troponin/cMyBPC-C0C2 interaction using microscale thermophoresis and identified cTnI and cTnT, but not cTnC as binding partners for cMyBPC-C0C2. Only cTn containing cTnI-R170G showed a reduced affinity towards cMyBPC-C0C2. Our results suggest that the RCM cTnI variants R170G/W impair the communication between thin and thick filament proteins and destabilize thin filaments."
https://openalex.org/W3010957868,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most fatal form of leishmaniasis if left untreated and 50,000 to 90,000 new cases of VL occur worldwide each year. Although various vaccines had been studied in animal models, none of them was eligible to prevent human from infections. In this study, according to the silico analysis of Leishmania Amastin, Kmp-11 and Gp63 protein, dominant epitope sequences of these proteins were selected and linked to construct dominant multi-epitopes DNA and protein vaccines (Amastin-Kmp-11, Amastin-Gp63 and Kmp-11-Gp63) against VL. BALB/c mice were immunized with a DNA prime-protein boost immunization strategy and challenged with a new Leishmania parasite strain isolated from a VL patient. After immunization, the results including specific antibody titers, IL-4 and TNF-α levels, and CD4 and CD8 T cell proportion suggested the potent immunogenicity of the three vaccines. After infection, the results of spleen parasite burdens in the three vaccine groups were significantly lower than those of control groups, and the parasite reduction rates of Amastin-Kmp-11, Amastin-Gp63 and Kmp-11-Gp63 groups were 89.38%, 91.01% and 88.42%, respectively. Spleen smear observation and liver histopathological changes showed that all vaccine groups could produce significant immunoprotection against VL and Amastin-Gp63 vaccine was the best. In conclusion, our work demonstrated that the three dominant multi-epitopes Amastin-Kmp-11, Amastin-Gp63 and Kmp-11-Gp63 DNA prime-protein boost vaccines might be new vaccine candidates for VL, and the Amastin-Gp63 vaccine have best efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3011881026,"This paper examines how older individuals living in 9 European countries evaluate their chances of survival. We use survey data for the years 2004 and 2015 to construct population-level gender-specific subjective length of life (or subjective life expectancy) in people between 60 and 90 years of age. Using a specially designed statistical approach based on survival analysis, we compare people's estimated subjective life expectancies with those actually observed. We find subjective life expectancies to be lower than actual life expectancies for both genders in 2004. In 2015 men become more realistic in the sense that their subjective life expectancy is close to what was actually observed, while women retain their subjective expectations of a shorter than actual life expectancy. These results help to better understand how people might construct diverse decisions related to their remaining life course."
https://openalex.org/W3012201473,"Banana (Musa sp.) is cultivated worldwide and is one of the most popular fruits. The soil-borne fungal disease Fusarium wilt of banana (FWB), commonly known as Panama disease, is caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) and is a highly lethal vascular fungal disease in banana plants. Raman spectroscopy, an emerging laser-based technology based on Raman scattering, has been used for the qualitative characterization of biological tissues such as foodborne pathogens, cancer cells, and melamine. In this study, we describe a Raman spectroscopic technique that could potentially be used as a method for diagnosing FWB. To that end, the Raman fingerprints of Foc (including mycelia and conidia) and Foc-infected banana pseudostems with varying levels of symptoms were determined. Our results showed that eight, eleven, and eleven characteristic surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy peaks were observed in the mycelia, microconidia, and macroconidia of Foc, respectively. In addition, we constructed the Raman spectroscopic fingerprints of banana pseudostem samples with varying levels of symptoms in order to be able to differentiate Foc-infected bananas from healthy bananas. The rate at which FWB was detected in asymptomatic Foc-infected samples by using the spectral method was 76.2%, which was comparable to the rates previously reported for other FWB detection methods based on real-time PCR assays, suggesting that the spectral method described herein could potentially serve as an alternative tool for detecting FWB in fields. As such, we hope that the developed spectral method will open up new possibilities for the on-site diagnosis of FWB."

The levels of A3A and A3B mRNA transcripts were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Insertion and deletion PCR assays were performed to detect the A3B deletion allele. The serum concentrations of soluble programmed death-ligand 1 (sPD-L1) and interferon gamma were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.A3B mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in triple-negative breast cancers compared to hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancers. Older age of the patient and high ki-67 expression were associated with increased expression levels of A3A and A3B mRNA. Advanced tumor stage, presence of lymph node involvement, and high histological grade were associated with increased expression levels of A3A mRNA. The APOBEC3A/B deletion allele was found in 77 (55.8%) patients. TP53 and PIK3CA mutations were detected in 62 (44.9%) and 31 (22.5%) patients, respectively. The presence of a PIK3CA mutation was associated with lower A3A mRNA expression levels. There was a weak positive relationship between A3A mRNA expression levels and serum sPD-L1 levels.There was a difference in A3B mRNA expression levels according to breast cancer subtypes, and high levels of A3A and A3B mRNA expressions were associated with an aggressive phenotype. There was a high incidence of APOBEC3A/B deletion allele. Further studies are needed to identify the clinical significance of APOBEC in Asian patients with breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3011750488,"Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), a pleiotropic cytokine, belongs to the hematopoietic growth factor family. Recent studies have reported that G-CSF is a predictive biomarker of oocyte and embryo developmental competence in humans. The aim of our study was to determine whether CSF3 and its receptor (CSF3R) were expressed in porcine maternal reproductive tissues (oviduct and uterus), cumulus cells, and embryos and to investigate the effects of human recombinant G-CSF (hrG-CSF) supplementation during in vitro culture (IVC) on the developmental competence of pre-implantation embryos. To do this, we first performed reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Second, we performed parthenogenetic activation (PA), in vitro fertilization (IVF), and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) to evaluate the embryonic developmental potential after hrG-CSF supplementation based on various concentrations (0 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, and 100 ng/mL) and durations (Un-treated, Days 0-3, Days 4-7, and Days 0-7) of IVC. Finally, we examined transcriptional levels of several marker genes in blastocysts. The results of our study showed that CSF3 transcript was present in all samples we assessed. CSF3-R was also detected, except in cumulus cells and blastocysts from PA. Furthermore, 10 ng/mL and Days 0-7 were the optimal concentration and duration for the viability of in vitro embryonic development, especially for SCNT-derived embryos. The rate of blastocyst formation and the total cell number of blastocysts were significantly enhanced, while the number and index of apoptotic nuclei were significantly decreased in optimal condition groups compared to others. Moreover, the transcriptional levels of anti-apoptotis- (BCL2), proliferation- (PCNA), and pluripotency- (POU5F1) related genes were dramatically upregulated. In conclusion, for the first time, we demonstrated that CSF3 and CSF3R were expressed in porcine reproductive organs, cells, and embryos. Additionally, we determined that hrG-CSF treatment improved porcine embryonic development capacity in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3012266897,"Although a robust inflammatory response is needed to combat infection, this response must ultimately be terminated to prevent chronic inflammation. One mechanism that terminates inflammatory signaling is the production of alternative mRNA splice forms in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. Whereas most genes in the TLR pathway encode positive mediators of inflammatory signaling, several, including that encoding the MyD88 signaling adaptor, also produce alternative spliced mRNA isoforms that encode dominant-negative inhibitors of the response. Production of these negatively acting alternatively spliced isoforms is induced by stimulation with the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS); thus, this alternative pre-mRNA splicing represents a negative feedback loop that terminates TLR signaling and prevents chronic inflammation. In the current study, we investigated the mechanisms regulating the LPS-induced alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the MyD88 transcript in murine macrophages. We found that 1) the induction of the alternatively spliced MyD88 form is due to alternative pre-mRNA splicing and not caused by another RNA regulatory mechanism, 2) MyD88 splicing is regulated by both the MyD88- and TRIF-dependent arms of the TLR signaling pathway, 3) MyD88 splicing is regulated by the NF-κB transcription factor, and 4) NF-κB likely regulates MyD88 alternative pre-mRNA splicing per se rather than regulating splicing indirectly by altering MyD88 transcription. We conclude that alternative splicing of MyD88 may provide a sensitive mechanism that ensures robust termination of inflammation for tissue repair and restoration of normal tissue homeostasis once an infection is controlled."

Some members of the NadE family use l-glutamine as a nitrogen donor and are named NadEGln. Previous gene neighborhood analysis has indicated that the bacterial nadE gene is frequently clustered with the gene encoding the regulatory signal transduction protein PII, suggesting a functional relationship between these proteins in response to the nutritional status and the carbon/nitrogen ratio of the bacterial cell. Here, using affinity chromatography, bioinformatics analyses, NAD synthetase activity, and biolayer interferometry assays, we show that PII and NadEGln physically interact in vitro, that this complex relieves NadEGln negative feedback inhibition by NAD+. This mechanism is conserved in distantly related bacteria. Of note, the PII protein allosteric effector and cellular nitrogen level indicator 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) inhibited the formation of the PII-NadEGln complex within a physiological range. These results indicate an interplay between the levels of ATP, ADP, 2-OG, PII-sensed glutamine, and NAD+, representing a metabolic hub that may balance the levels of core nitrogen and carbon metabolites.

https://openalex.org/W3011885179,"Pregnant women with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at high risk for hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP). Women with poor control DM sometimes have heavy-for-dates infants. However, women with HDP sometimes have light-for-dates infants. We aim to clarify the relationship between glycemic control and fetal growth in women with DM and/or subsequent HDP. Of 7893 women gave singleton birth at or after 22 gestational weeks, we enrolled 154 women with type 1 DM (T1DM) or type 2 DM (T2DM) whose infants did not have fetal abnormalities. Among women with T1DM or T2DM, characteristics of the three groups (with HDP, without HDP, and with chronic hypertension [CH]) were compared. No women with T1DM had CH, but 19 (17.4%) of 109 with T2DM did. HDP incidence was similar between women with T1DM (22.2%) and T2DM without CH (16.7%). Among women with T1DM, the incidences of fetal growth restriction (FGR) with and without HDP were similar. However, among women with T2DM without CH, this incidence was significantly higher among those with HDP (33.3%) than among those without HDP (5.3%), was significantly more common with HbA1c levels at first trimester ≥ 7.2% (33.3%) than with those < 7.2% (5.6%), and significantly more numerous without pre-pregnancy therapies for DM (23.3%) than with them (3.3%). Among women with T2DM and HDP, those with FGR had smaller placenta SDs and higher insulin dosages at delivery than those without light-for-dates. In multivariate analysis, the presence of diabetic nephropathy was a predictor of T1DM and HDP (P = 0.0105), whereas HbA1c levels ≥ 7.2% before pregnancy was a predictor of T2DM and HDP (P = 0.0009). Insulin dosage ≥ 50U/day at delivery (P = 0.0297) and the presence of HDP (P = 0.0116) independently predicted T2DM, HDP, and FGR development. Insufficient pre-pregnancy treatment of DM increased the risk of HDP."

Yeasts diversity of Kuan Kreng (KK) and Rayong Botanical Garden (RBG) PSF, which are two secondary PSF in southern and in eastern Thailand, respectively, were investigated. Yeasts were isolated from soil and peat soil by the dilution plate and enrichment techniques. From six samples collected from KK PSF, 35 strains were obtained, and they were identified based on the sequence analysis of the D1/D2 region of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene 13 species in 12 genera, and one potential new species of the genus Galactomyces were detected. Thirty-two strains were obtained from six samples collected from RBG PSF and 26 strains were identified as 13 known yeast species in 11 genera, whereas six strains were found to represent two potential new species of the genera Papiliotrema and Moesziomyces. Among yeast strains isolated from KK PSF, the number of strains in the phylum Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were equal, whereas there were slightly fewer strains in Ascomycota than in Basidiomycota among the strains obtained from RBG PSF. The yeast strains were evaluated for their antagonistic activities against fungal pathogens which cause rice diseases (Fusarium moniliforme, Helminthosporium oryzae, Rhizoctonia solani, Curvularia lunata and Pyricularia grisea) and postharvest disease of fruits (Phytophthora palmivora, Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides). Twelve strains of seven species were found to be antagonistic yeast strains.

https://openalex.org/W2928833045,"Background An orally active synthetic adiponectin receptor agonist, AdipoRon has been suggested to ameliorate insulin resistance, and glucose tolerance. However, the chronic effect of AdipoRon in the vascular dysfunction in type 2 diabetes has not been studied yet. Thus, in this study, we examined whether AdipoRon improves vascular function in type 2 diabetes. Methods Type 2 diabetic (db-/db-) mice were treated with AdipoRon (10 mg/kg/everyday, by oral gavage) for 2 weeks. Body weight and blood glucose levels were recorded every other day during the experimental period. Diameter of mesenteric arteries was measured. And western blot analysis was performed with mesenteric arteries. Results Pressure-induced myogenic response was significantly increased while endothelium-dependent relaxation was reduced in the mesenteric arteries of db-/db- mice. Treatment of AdipoRon normalized potentiated myogenic response, whereas endothelium-dependent relaxation was not affected by treatment of AdipoRon. The expression levels of AdiR1, AdiR2, APPL1, and APPL 2 were increased in the mesenteric arteries of db-/db- mice and treatment of AdipoRon did not affect them. Interestingly, AdipoRon treatment increased the phospho-AMPK and decreased MYPT1 phosphorylation in db-/db- mice while there was no change in the level of eNOS phosphorylation. Conclusion The treatment of AdipoRon improves vascular function in the mesenteric arteries of db-/db- mice through endothelium-independent mechanism. We suggest that MLCP activation through reduced phosphorylation of MYPT1 might be the dominant mechanism in the AdipoRon-induced vascular effect."
https://openalex.org/W3010985447,"Human immunoglobulin G isotype 4 (IgG4) antibodies are suitable for use in either the antagonist or agonist format because their low effector functions prevent target cytotoxicity or unwanted cytokine secretion. However, while manufacturing therapeutic antibodies, they are exposed to low pH during purification, and IgG4 is more susceptible to low-pH-induced aggregation than IgG1. Therefore, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of IgG4 aggregation at low pH and engineered an IgG4 with enhanced stability. By swapping the constant regions of IgG1 and IgG4, we determined that the constant heavy chain (CH3) domain is critical for aggregate formation, but a core-hinge-stabilizing S228P mutation in IgG4 is insufficient for preventing aggregation. To identify the aggregation-prone amino acid, we substituted the CH3 domain of IgG4 with that of IgG1, changing IgG4 Arg409 to a Lys, thereby preventing the aggregation of the IgG4 variant as effectively as in IgG1. A stabilizing effect was also recorded with other variable-region variants. Analysis of thermal stability using differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the R409K substitution increased the Tm value of CH3, suggesting that the R409K mutation contributed to the structural strengthening of the CH3-CH3 interaction. The R409K mutation did not influence the binding to antigens/human Fcγ receptors; whereas, the concurrent S228P and R409K mutations in IgG4 suppressed Fab-arm exchange drastically and as effectively as in IgG1, in both in vitro and in vivo in mice models. Our findings suggest that the IgG4 R409K variant represents a potential therapeutic IgG for use in low-effector-activity format that exhibits increased stability."

It has been reported that treatments with JAs could increase the contents of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids in Amaryllidaceae plants. Jasmonate ZIM (zinc-finger inflorescence meristem) domain (JAZ) proteins are key components in JA signal processes. However, JAZ proteins have not been characterized in genus Lycoris. In this study, we identified and cloned seven differentially expressed JAZ genes (namely LaJAZ1–LaJAZ7) from Lycoris aurea. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that these seven LaJAZ proteins contain the ZIM domain and JA-associated (Jas, also named CCT_2) motif. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that these LaJAZ genes display different expression patterns in L. aurea tissues, and most of them are inducible when treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. Subcellular localization assay demonstrated that LaJAZ proteins are localized in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm. In addition, LaJAZ proteins could interact with each other to form homodimer and/or heterodimer. The findings in this study may facilitate further functional research of the LaJAZ genes, especially the potential regulatory mechanism of plant secondary metabolites including Amaryllidaceae alkaloids in L. aurea."
https://openalex.org/W3012060812,"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a potent neurotoxin that biomagnifies in marine food webs. Inorganic mercury (Hg) methylation is conducted by heterotrophic bacteria inhabiting sediment or settling detritus, but endogenous methylation by the gut microbiome of animals in the lower food webs is another possible source. We examined the occurrence of the bacterial gene (hgcA), required for Hg methylation, in the guts of dominant zooplankters in the Northern Baltic Sea. A qPCR assay targeting the hgcA sequence in three main clades (Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes and Archaea) was used in the field-collected specimens of copepods (Acartia bifilosa, Eurytemora affinis, Pseudocalanus acuspes and Limnocalanus macrurus) and cladocerans (Bosmina coregoni maritima and Cercopagis pengoi). All copepods were found to carry hgcA genes in their gut microbiome, whereas no amplification was recorded in the cladocerans. In the copepods, hgcA genes belonging to only Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were detected. These findings suggest a possibility that endogenous Hg methylation occurs in zooplankton and may contribute to seasonal, spatial and vertical MeHg variability in the water column and food webs. Additional molecular and metagenomics studies are needed to identify bacteria carrying hgcA genes and improve their quantification in microbiota."

The 10-valent protein conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PHiD-CV) was introduced into the childhood vaccination program in 2011. The aim of the study was to investigate the changes in antimicrobial susceptibility and serotype distribution of penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci (PNSP) in Iceland 2011-2017.All pneumococcal isolates identified at the Landspítali University Hospital in 2011-2017, excluding isolates from the nasopharynx and throat were studied. Susceptibility testing was done according to the EUCAST guidelines using disk diffusion with chloramphenicol, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and oxacillin for PNSP screening. Penicillin and ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were measured for oxacillin resistant isolates using the E-test. Serotyping was done using latex agglutination and/or multiplex PCR. The total number of pneumococcal isolates that met the study criteria was 1,706, of which 516 (30.2%) were PNSP, and declining with time. PNSP isolates of PHiD-CV vaccine serotypes (VT) were 362/516 (70.2%) declining with time, 132/143 (92.3%) in 2011 and 17/54 (31.5%) in 2017. PNSP were most commonly of serotype 19F, 317/516 isolates declining with time, 124/143 in 2011 and 15/54 in 2017. Their number decreased in all age groups, but mainly in the youngest children. PNSP isolates of non PHiD-CV vaccine serotypes (NVT) were 154/516, increasing with time, 11/14, in 2011 and 37/54 in 2017. The most common emerging NVTs in 2011 and 2017 were 6C, 1/143 and 10/54 respectively.PNSP of VTs have virtually disappeared from children with pneumococcal diseases after the initiation of pneumococcal vaccination in Iceland and a clear herd effect was observed. This was mainly driven by a decrease of PNSP isolates belonging to a serotype 19F multi-resistant lineage. However, emerging multi-resistant NVT isolates are of concern."

We developed an environmental assessment tool to evaluate the extent child and youth activity programs implement physical literacy across four domains: environment, programming, leaders and staff, and values and goals. The Physical Literacy Environmental Assessment (PLEA) tool was developed in 3 phases. First, the PLEA tool was created, content validity established, and physical literacy leaders were consulted. In the second phase, the PLEA tool was completed and tested by 83 child and youth programs and it was validated with individual physical literacy assessments completed on children in programs that scored in the top 10% and bottom 10% on the PLEA tool. Third, a National consultation was conducted, and program leaders provided feedback on the PLEA tool. In Phase 1, the PLEA tool was modified and shortened from 41 to 29 indicators, based on feedback from physical literacy content leaders. In Phase 2, participants in programs that scored in the top 10% had significantly higher scores on the upper body object control domain of PLAYfun (p = 0.018), and significantly higher PLAYself scores (p = 0.04) than participants in programs that scored in the bottom 10%. In Phase 3, over 80% of program leaders identified the PLEA tool was useful, and relevant to their areas of practice. The completed PLEA tool is a 20-item environmental assessment tool to evaluate to what degree child and youth programming implement physical literacy across four domains: environment, programming, leaders and staff, and values and goals. The application and validity of the PLEA tool beyond child and youth physical education, sport, dance and recreation sectors, such as in early years programs, should be investigated."

In Experiment 1 we examined foveal processing of the target word/nonword stimuli, and in Experiment 2 we examined parafoveal pre-processing. There were four participant groups–older teenagers with a history of dyslexia, older typically developing teenagers who were matched for age, younger typically developing teenagers who were matched for reading level, and younger teenagers with a history of dyslexia. All four participant groups showed a pseudohomophone advantage, both from foveal processing and parafoveal pre-processing, indicating that teenagers with a history of dyslexia engage in phonological recoding for lexical identification during silent sentence reading in a comparable manner to their typically developing peers."
https://openalex.org/W3011923049,"Background Although the high disease burden that results from cardiovascular complications of hypertension, factors related to the progression to hypertension in the normotensive population are not actively reported. The purpose of this study was to estimate the rate of the progression to hypertension and to reveal the associated risk factors. Methods The study included normotensive participants from the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort, and contained a 10% sample of all adults who received a national health screening test in either 2002 or 2003. At the end of the study in 2015, the patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not they progressed to hypertension. Cox proportional hazard modeling was performed to identify risk factors for progression. Subgroup analysis using logistic regression was employed to reveal factors influencing the different natural history of the progression. Results Among the 75,335 included participants, the progression rate to hypertension was 66.39% (50,013), with an adjusted incidence rate of 8.62 per 100 person-year in the aged 40–64 group and 12.68 in the aged 65 or above group. Age, BMI, hemoglobin, and family history of hypertension and other diseases were related to the progression. Among the progression group, 78.21% (39,116) participants skipped a pre-hypertensive status; this group consisted of older females with lower pulse pressure and more alcohol consumption compared to people who had pre-hypertensive status before the progression. Conclusion Substantial risk factors for the progression to hypertension should be carefully managed even in normotensive participants who receive health screening tests."

Based on this analysis, OVCA2 was confirmed as a serine hydrolase with a strong preference for long-chain alkyl ester substrates (>10-carbons) and high selectivity against a variety of short, branched, and substituted esters. Substitutional analysis was used to identify the catalytic residues of OVCA2 with a Ser117-His206-Asp179 classic catalytic triad. Comparison of the substrate specificity of OVCA2 to the model homologue FSH1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae illustrated the tighter substrate selectivity of OVCA2, but their overlapping substrate preference for extended straight-chain alkyl esters. Conformation of the overlapping biochemical properties of OVCA2 and FSH1 was used to model structural information about OVCA2. Together our analysis provides detailed substrate specificity information about a previously, uncharacterized human serine hydrolase and begins to define the biological properties of OVCA2."
https://openalex.org/W3012297226,"We present a two-tiered microchip system to capture and retrieve rare cells from blood samples with high purity. The first module of the system is a high throughput microfluidic interface that is used to immunomagnetically isolate targeted rare cells from whole blood, and discard > 99.999% of the unwanted leukocytes. The second module is a microwell array that furthers the purification by magnetically guiding each cell into a separate well concurrently, and allows individual retrieval of each cell. We demonstrate the design of the system as well as its characterization by experiments using model cell lines that represent circulating fetal trophoblasts. Our results show that single cells can be retrieved with efficiencies and purities as high as 100% within 145 mins."
https://openalex.org/W3011668810,"We investigated the influence of incorporating tartrazine on the dose response characteristics of radiochromic 3D dosimeters based on polyurethane resin. We use three types of polyurethane resins with different Shore hardness values: 30 A, 50 A, and 80 D. PRESAGE dosimeters are fabricated with different chemical components and concentrations. Tartrazine (Yellow No. 5) helps incorporate a yellow dye to fabricate the dosimeter. Elemental composition is analyzed with the Zeff. Three sets of six different PRESAGE dosimeters were fabricated to investigate the effects of incorporating yellow dye on the dose response characteristics of the dosimeter. The dose response curve was obtained by measuring the optical absorbance using a spectrometer and optical density using optical CT, respectively. The energy and dose rate dependences are evaluated for the dosimeter with the highest sensitivity. For the optical density measurement, significant sensitivity enhancements of 36.6% and 32.7% were achieved in polyurethane having a high Shore hardness of 80 D and 50 A by incorporating tartrazine, respectively. The same results were obtained in the optical absorbance measurements. The ratio of the Zeff of the dosimeter with 80 D Shore hardness to water was 1.49. The polyurethane radiochromic dosimeter with a Shore hardness of 80 D showed the highest sensitivity and energy and dose rate independence upon the incorporation of tartrazine."
https://openalex.org/W3012450584,"The Self-Image Scale is a self-report measure originally developed for use in women with cancer. Two subscales assess appearance satisfaction (self-acceptance) and perceptions of partners' acceptance of their appearance (partner-acceptance). This study aimed to increase the Self-Image Scale's utility by 1) confirming the two-factor structure of the German version of the Self-Image Scale, 2) testing measurement invariance across sex and age groups and validity, and 3) gathering general population normative data.Confirmatory factor analysis methods were used to examine the proposed two-factor model in a random sample of adults from the general German population (N = 1367). Measurement invariance, scale reliability, and validity were assessed.The original factor structure and measurement invariance across sexes and age groups were supported. Women showed significantly lower self-acceptance than men. Adolescent and young adult women showed higher self-acceptance than senior women. For both sexes, partner-acceptance lowered across successive age cohorts. Internal consistencies were good.Results support the use of the German version of the Self-Image Scale in research and clinical practice. Research directions include validation in further diseases, collecting normative data across countries, and dyadic research, particularly exploring partner-acceptance across the life span."
https://openalex.org/W3010677888,"To investigate the effects of urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin impregnation combined heat treatment (IMPG-HT) on the pyrolysis behavior of poplar wood, the chemical composition, pyrolysis characteristics, pyrolysis kinetics, and gaseous products released during pyrolysis of untreated (control), IMPG-HT, IMPG and HT woods were analyzed. The results demonstrate that IMPG-HT changes pyrolysis behavior of poplar wood significantly. Unlike the control and HT samples, the thermogravimetric / derivative thermogravimetric (TG/DTG) curves of IMPG wood shift toward lower temperature, and the shoulder on DTG curves weaken or even disappear. The maximum mass loss rate of IMPG-HT samples decreases, and carbon residual yield increases to 23% or more and activation energy (E) increases sharply after conversion rate (α) reaching 0.80. HT improves the thermal stability of IMPG wood, which is represented by the increase of decomposition temperature (Td) and DTG peak temperature (Tpeak) and the higher E value of IMPG-HT wood. For the pyrolysis gaseous products, IMPG-HT wood produces nitrogen-containing gases (HNCO and NH3) due to the presence of UF resin, but the amounts of these gases are less than that produced by IMPG wood because the heat treatment had removed part of N elements."
https://openalex.org/W3012440597,"The aim of the present study was to analyze the time series of team spread during futsal official matches in the frequency domain for different categories. Using an automatic tracking method, trajectories of 258 players (excluding goalkeepers) were obtained, composed of 79 players from the under-15 (U15) category, 86 from the under-18 (U18), and 93 from the professional. We calculated the team spread defined as the Euclidean norm of the distance-between-player vector as a function of time. We applied the Fast Fourier Transformation method and calculated the median frequency for each time series of spread. The results of mean ± SD of the median frequency of the time series of spread from the first to the second half were significantly different only for the U15 category (first half, 1.04 ± 0.46, second half 1.40 ± 0.34). The frequency values differed significantly between the categories. The younger categories presented a higher frequency of spread oscillation than the professional category, which reflects the dynamics of the game between attack and defense sequences. The results provide insights into the features of the sport and present a basis for appropriate training interventions for players in each category, planning for future transition to the following category."
https://openalex.org/W3010777839,"The aim of the study was to detect and genetically characterize Arcobacter butzleri in pet red-footed tortoises suspected for Campylobacter spp., using molecular techniques. A written consent from tortoise owners was obtained, after explaining the advantages of the research to tortoise owners of Grenada. Fecal samples were collected from 114 tortoises from five parishes of the country and cultured for Campylobacter spp. using selective culture techniques. A. butzleri was isolated from 4.39% of pet tortoises. Total thirteen isolates were obtained; all identified as A. butzleri by a universal and a species-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. Genetic characterization of these isolates was performed based on Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR (ERIC-PCR) that generated eight different genetic fingerprints with a discriminatory power of 0.91. Campylobacter species were not detected molecularly in any of the culture-positive samples. This is the first report of infection of pet tortoises in Grenada, West Indies with A. butzleri. This study emphasizes on the risk of zoonotic transmission of A. butzleri by exotic pets, which is a serious concern for public health."

https://openalex.org/W3011843140,"As part of a verification model of antibiotic therapy in cranioplasty, we evaluated the impregnation efficiency of interporous calcium phosphate materials with saline under atmospheric pressure and compared it to the efficiency of using the decompression method established by the Japanese Industrial Standard, under which pressure is reduced by 10 kPa. Five types of material formed in 1 mL cubes were selected as test samples: two consisting of hydroxyapatite (HAp) with 85% and 55% porosity and three of β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) with 75%, 67%, and 57% porosity. All test samples showed an impregnation ratio of more than 70%, except for the HAp sample with 55% porosity, which had a ratio of approximately 50%. These high ratios were achieved at only 15 min. The impregnation effects were likely dependent on porosity and were independent of base material, either HAp or β-TCP. Obtaining sufficient impregnation and antimicrobial efficacy in materials with low porosity, which are commonly used in cranioplasty, would require an increased volume of antibiotics rather than increased duration of impregnation. Our findings will enable the simple preparation of drug-impregnated calcium phosphate materials, even in operating rooms not equipped with a large decompression device."
https://openalex.org/W3011777095,"Intrinsic fluorescence of biological material, also called auto-fluorescence, is a well-known phenomenon and has in recent years been used for imaging, diagnostics and cell viability studies. Here we show that in addition to commonly observed auto-fluorescence, intrinsic anti-Stokes emission can also be observed under 560 nm or 633 nm excitation. The anti-Stokes emission is shown to be spatially located on/in the mitochondria. The findings presented here show that sensitive imaging experiments e.g. single molecule experiments or two-photon excitation imaging can be compromised if intracellular anti-Stokes emission is not accounted for. On the other hand, we suggest that this anti-Stokes emission could be exploited as an additional modality for mitochondria visualization and cell viability investigation even in systems that are already labeled with commonly used fluorophores that rely on normal Stokes-based detection."
