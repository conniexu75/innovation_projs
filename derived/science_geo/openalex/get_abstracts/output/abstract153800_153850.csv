One factor that plays an important role in the metabolic response to fasting is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). To gain more insight into the role of PPARα during fasting, and into the regulation of metabolism during fasting in general, a search for unknown PPARα target genes was performed. Using subtractive hybridization (SABRE) comparing liver mRNA from wild-type and PPARα null mice, we isolated a novel PPARα target gene, encoding the secreted protein FIAF (for fasting induced adipose factor), that belongs to the family of fibrinogen/angiopoietin-like proteins. FIAF is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and is strongly up-regulated by fasting in white adipose tissue and liver. Moreover, FIAF mRNA is decreased in white adipose tissue of PPARγ +/− mice. FIAF protein can be detected in various tissues and in blood plasma, suggesting that FIAF has an endocrine function. Its plasma abundance is increased by fasting and decreased by chronic high fat feeding. The data suggest that FIAF represents a novel endocrine signal involved in the regulation of metabolism, especially under fasting conditions.

Despite intensive research over the past decades, the knowledge about the metabolic derangements precipitating to and accompanying type II diabetes remains fragmentary. One factor that has limited progress of diabetes research has been a lack of clear understanding of the regulation of nutrient metabolism under normal, non-diabetic conditions. Indeed, much still needs to be learned about the genetics of metabolism during various physiological states, such as fasting. Fasting can be described as a state when food intake has been arrested for a significant amount of time. The absence of energy entering the body evokes a complex physiological response aimed at maintaining whole body homeostasis. A critical event in the fasting response is the liberation of fatty acids from the adipose tissue and their preferential use as an energy substrate in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver. The metabolic adaptations accompanying fasting are governed by numerous endocrine and cellular factors. Fasting results in pronounced changes in the plasma concentrations of important metabolic hormones such as insulin, glucocorticoids, leptin, and glucagon. In addition, fasting causes altered expression levels of important transcription factors, such as sterol response element-binding protein (1Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), c-Myc (2Corcos D. Vaulont S. Denis N. Lyonnet S. Simon M.P. Kitzis A. Kahn A. Kruh J. Oncogene Res. 1987; 2: 193-199Google Scholar), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)1 (3Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar), directing specific changes in the expression of metabolic enzymes. We and others (3Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 4Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) have recently shown the important role of PPARα in the fasting response. By stimulating the oxidation of fatty acids in liver, this transcription factor assures an efficient output of ketone bodies and glucose by the liver. Besides PPARα, two other PPARs (β and γ) are currently known (5Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). All belong to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, which encompasses a large collection of transcription factors that regulate transcription in response to small lipophilic compounds such as retinoic acid, vitamin D, thyroid hormone, and fatty acids (6Gronemeyer H. Laudet V. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1173-1308PubMed Google Scholar). Like other nuclear hormone receptor, PPARs bind to the promoter of target genes and stimulate transcription after binding of a specific ligand. In the case of PPARα, a variety of fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives have been shown to bind and activate PPARα. This includes long-chain unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid; branched, conjugated, and oxidized fatty acids such as phytanic acid and conjugated linoleic acid; and eicosanoids such as 8(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotriene B4 (5Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). Functionally, the PPARα and PPARγ isotypes have been relatively well characterized. For PPARα, it has been shown, both in vitro and in vivo, that this receptor plays an important role in the oxidation of fatty acids in the liver by activating the expression of many genes involved in this metabolic pathway (7Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar, 8Peters J.M. Aoyama T. Cattley R.C. Nobumitsu U. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1989-1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PPARα also mediates the effect of peroxisome proliferators on hepatic cell proliferation, as demonstrated by the observation that mice that lack PPARα are refractory to the effects of peroxisome proliferators (9Peters J.M.

Whereas PPARα functions in lipid catabolism, the role of PPARγ seems to be geared toward anabolic pathways, particularly in adipose tissue. Activation of PPARγ in preadipocytes is sufficient to direct the cell toward the adipocyte differentiation program (11Wu Z. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), leading to dramatic build-up of lipid inside the cell. Other tissues where PPARγ may play a role include the colon and monocytes/macrophages where PPARγ may play a role in cytokine production (12Ricote M. Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Glass C.K. J. Leukocyte. Biol. 1999; 66: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Studies with PPARα null mice have shown that PPARα becomes especially important during fasting (3Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 4Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). When fasted, these mice suffer from a defect in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, resulting in elevated plasma free fatty acid levels, hypoketonemia, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia. To gain more insight into the function of PPARα and to increase our understanding of the genetic regulation of metabolism during fasting, an unbiased subtractive hybridization assay was performed to search for unknown PPARα target genes. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel PPARα target gene, FIAF, for fasting-induced adipose factor, implicated in the metabolic response to fasting. Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room (23 °C) on a 10-h dark, 14-h light cycle. Pure-bred wild-type or PPARα-null mice on a sv129 background were used (7Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Animal experiments were approved by the animal authorization commission of the canton of Vaud (Switzerland). Fasted animals were deprived of food for 24 h, starting at the beginning of the light cycle. Fed animals were sacrificed at the end of the dark cycle. WY14643 was administered by dissolving it in the drinking water (0.1%) for 3 weeks. The high fat diet (39% fat energy) was high in saturated fat (coconut oil-based, ICN Research Diets) and followed for 15 weeks. Generation of the PPARγ +/− mice will be described elsewhere. Briefly, the A/B domain and the 5′-end of the first zinc finger were deleted, resulting in removal of the translation start site. Both wild-type and mutant mRNA can be detected in PPARγ +/− mice. SABRE (selective amplification via biotin and restriction-mediated enrichment) employs selective streptavidin-biotin affinity and restriction enzyme site reconstitution to enrich for cDNA species more abundant in one population than in another (13Lavery D.J. Lopez-Molina L. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6831-6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One male sv129 wild-type mouse and one male PPARα null mouse of about 8 months of age were sacrificed in the middle of the light cycle. Experimental details on preparation of cDNA and further analysis by SABRE will be described elsewhere. Total RNA was prepared from frozen livers, white adipose tissue, and brown adipose tissue using the RNeasy midikit (Qiagen) or from other tissues using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 15–30 μg of total RNA was loaded per lane. Electrophoresis, blotting, and hybridization were done according to standard protocols. The cDNA of the ribosomal protein L27 was used as a control probe. Labeling was carried out using a High Prime kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The full-length sequence of the cDNA of mouse FIAF was obtained by 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). The sequences of the primers used were: 5′-RACE, GGTCCCCACGGAGGTCATGGTCTTGG; 3′-RACE, GGGTGAGGACACAGCCTACAGCCTGC. Mouse liver cDNA was used as the template. The open reading frame of mouse FIAF was subcloned into the green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion vector pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH), which contains a strong cytomegalovirus promoter, to create the mFIAF-GFP fusion construct (GFP is located toward the C terminus). To obtain mFIAFnot fused to GFP, the termination codon of mFIAF was left intact. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with the vectors indicated above by calcium-phosphate precipitation. Immediately after transfection, medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without calf serum. 24 h after transfection, the medium was harvested, centrifuged to remove remaining cells, and stored at −20 °C. Protein was precipitated by adding 8 volumes of cold acetone and leaving the medium at −20 °C for several hours. Protein was pelleted by centrifugation and, after washing, redissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. SDS-PAGE was further performed according to standard procedures. The polyclonal antibody used was directed against the epitope CQGPKGKDAPFKDSE in the N-terminal region of FIAF. The peptide affinity-purified antibody was generated in rabbit and ordered via Eurogentec's customized antibody production service. Western blotting was carried out using an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000, the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG, Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:8000. All incubations were performed in TBS, pH 7.5, with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk, except for the final washings when the dry milk was omitted. A BamHI/EcoRI fragment was excised off a partial L27 cDNA and subcloned into pBluescript KS (Stratagene). The resulting vector, pBS-L27, was linearized by EcoRI and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase yielding a 200-base riboprobe and a protected fragment of 150 bp. A 300-bp fragment containing the 5′-end of FIAF was subcloned into pBluescript KS. A 356-base antisense riboprobe was synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase, resulting in a 300-bp protected fragment. For FIAF probe a ratio of 1:1 of [α32-P]UTP to cold UTP was used, whereas a 1:20 ratio was used for the L27 probe. Incorporation and specific activity of each probe was determined after purification via RNeasy Clean-Up (Qiagen). Direct lysate ribonuclease protection assay was carried out as described by the manufacturer (Ambion) with some modifications (14Haines D.S. Gillespie D.H. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 736-741PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in lysis/denaturation solution (2 mg/ml) and further clarified by centrifugation via a Qiashredder (Qiagen). 20 μl of lysate was hybridized to 10 ng of specific FIAF probe (1 × 109cpm/mg) and 10 ng of L27 probe (1 × 108cpm/mg). RNase digestion (10 units/ml RNase A; 400 units/ml RNase T1) was carried out for all probes at 37 °C for 20 min. The products of ribonuclease protection assay were resolved in a 6% electrolyte-gradient denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Blood was drawn by retro-orbital puncture. Blood was collected into heparinized tubes, kept on ice, and spun for 10 min to collect plasma. Plasma was kept at −70 °C. To search for unknown genes regulated by PPARα, we compared liver mRNA from wild-type and PPARα null mice by performing the subtractive hybridization assay SABRE described above (13Lavery D.J. Lopez-Molina L. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6831-6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One of the cDNA fragments isolated corresponded to an unknown gene (further referred to as FIAF for reasons explained below), whose differential expression between wild-type and PPARα null mice was evident by Northern blot (Fig. 1 A). To obtain the full-length mouse cDNA of FIAF, 5′- and 3′-RACE were carried out using internal primers of the 600-bp cDNA fragment (Fig. 1 B). Primer extension revealed that the 5′-RACE fragment stopped about 25 bp short of the transcriptional start site. The genomic sequence could be directly extracted from the GenBank™ data base (accession number AF110520.1), because the mouse FIAF gene happens to be located in the mouse major histocompatibility complex II locus on chromosome 17, in a region that has been completely sequenced. With the genomic sequence information, the core promoter containing a putative TATA box could be located. The mouse FIAF gene contains seven exons and six introns, spanning about 7 kb (Fig. 1 C). From the full-length cDNA an ORF of 1233 bp could be derived, giving rise to a protein of 410 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of around 46 kDa (Fig. 1 B). Further analysis of the primary sequence revealed similarity with a family of proteins that contain a so-called fibrinogen-like domain. In addition, a coiled-coil domain that typically precedes the fibrinogen-like domain was present. The highest similarity was found with a group of angiopoietins and with ficolin-A. Angiopoietins have been implicated in endothelial developmental processes, whereas ficolin seems to bind sugar residues on bacterial surfaces. However, the identity at the amino acid level did not exceed 24%, suggesting that the function of FIAF is likely to be different from the angiopoietins and from ficolin. In analogy with other fibrinogen-like proteins, a putative signal sequence was found at the N terminus of FIAF possibly directing secretion of the protein. To investigate whether the protein was indeed secreted, the ORF was subcloned behind a cytomegalovirus promoter and the vector was transfected into HEK293 cells. The ORF was also linked to green fluorescent protein to create a GFP fusion protein. A polyclonal antibody directed against a non-conserved peptide in the N-terminal region was synthesized. As shown in Fig.2, FIAF could be detected in the culture medium by Western blot, both as the GFP fusion protein (lane 2), and as the native protein (lane 3), indicating that FIAF is indeed secreted.Figure 2mFIAF is a secreted protein. HEK293 cells were transfected with an empty vector (lane 1), a vector expressing a fusion between mFIAF and green fluorescent protein (lane 2), or an expression vector for mFIAF alone (lane 3). 24 h after transfection the culture medium was collected and prepared for SDS-PAGE (170 μl of medium/lane). Western blotting was performed with a peptide-purified antibody directed against a specific epitope in the N-terminal region of mFIAF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although FIAF was cloned from a liver cDNA library, it is probably expressed elsewhere as well. To examine the expression profile of FIAF, Northern blot was performed using RNA from a variety of tissues. Interestingly, FIAF was very highly expressed in white adipose tissue and to a somewhat lesser extent in brown adipose tissue (Fig.3). Other tissues such as lung, kidney, and liver also expressed FIAF but at much lower levels. No signal could be detected in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. Taken together, the data show that FIAF encodes a secreted, angiopoietin/fibrinogen-like protein, primarily produced by the adipose tissue. Because FIAF was less expressed in liver of PPARα null mice than in wild-type mice, it is possible that FIAF is a target gene of PPARα and of synthetic PPARα ligands such as fibrates. To study the effect of PPARα on FIAF expression, mice were treated with the potent PPARα ligand WY14643. In wild-type mice but not in PPARα null mice, WY14643 increased expression of FIAF, providing further evidence that FIAF is a PPARα target gene in liver (Fig.4 A). To study the factors influencing the expression of FIAF and thereby provide some clues about the possible function of this protein, the effect of fasting was examined. Fasting was chosen because it is accompanied by an increase in PPARα expression (3Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Moreover, the effects of PPARα deletion become more manifest during fasting (3Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 4Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Interestingly, fasting caused a dramatic increase in FIAF expression in liver, but the PPARα dependence was completely lost (Fig. 4 B). A marked increase in FIAF expression was observed in white adipose tissue (WAT) as well. For this reason the protein was named FIAF, for fasting induced adipose factor. Remarkably, in WAT FIAF expression was higher in PPARα null mice than in wild-type mice. WAT contains very little PPARα (15Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). In contrast, the PPARγ isotype is very abundant in WAT (15Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). To examine whether expression of FIAF in adipose tissue is under control of PPARγ, FIAF mRNA was determined in WAT of heterozygous PPARγ mutant mice. Heterozygous PPARγ mutant mice were chosen, because homozygous null mice are embryonically lethal (16Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Satoh S. Nakano R. Ishii C. Sugiyama T. Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Okuno A. Murakami K. Sekihara H. Hasegawa G. Naito M. Toyoshima Y. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Kitamura T. Fujita T. Ezaki O. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Tobe K. Kimura S.

Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, mFIAF mRNA expression was down-regulated in PPARγ +/− mice. Because FIAF is a secreted protein, it was of interest to investigate whether it may be circulating in the blood plasma. Interestingly, using the purified antibody against FIAF in Western blotting, a band could be detected in plasma at exactly the same molecular weight as FIAF protein produced in cell culture, suggesting that it corresponds to FIAF (Fig.6 A). This band was also observed in liver, kidney, WAT, and brown adipose tissue (BAT), tissues where FIAF is produced (Fig. 6, A and B). In kidney, BAT, and WAT, another band was observed with a slightly higher molecular weight than the original band. Most likely, this slower moving band represents FIAF immediately after synthesis, with the signal sequence still attached. It is also possible that the two bands represent different glycosylated forms of the protein, which have been previously shown to occur for the angiopoietins. To corroborate that the band observed in plasma truly represented FIAF protein, the effect of fasting was examined. Fasting caused an approximate 2-fold increase in the intensity of the putative FIAF band, in accordance with the mRNA expression data showing an increased FIAF expression during fasting (Fig. 6 C). Interestingly, prolonged feeding of a high fat diet, which was accompanied by an average 2.2-fold increase in epididymal fat mass, decreased the intensity of the putative FIAF band by about 2-fold (Fig. 6 D). Modulation of FIAF abundance in plasma was, however, not associated with altered expression of mRNA levels in liver (Fig.7 A) or WAT (Fig.7 B).Figure 7mRNA expression of FIAF in liver and white adipose tissue is not affected by high fat feeding. A, Northern blot of liver RNA of mice fed a normal or high fat diet for 15 weeks. B, Northern blot of WAT RNA of mice fed a normal or high fat diet for 15 weeks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Besides being important for the storage and subsequent release of fatty acids, research over the past decade has shown that white adipose tissue also has an important endocrine function. Factors such as plasminogen activator inhibitor I, tumor necrosis factor α, and leptin are produced by the adipose tissue to exert effects elsewhere in the body. Here we describe the cloning of a novel fibrinogen/angiopoietin-like factor, primarily secreted from the adipose tissue, whose production is elevated during fasting and whose mRNA expression is stimulated by PPARα in liver and by PPARγ in WAT. In recent years, a wealth of data has accumulated about leptin, the product of the mouse ob gene. Initially viewed as a sensor of the fat stores that acts on the hypothalamus to inhibit food intake, leptin is now realized to have a much broader role in energy homeostasis (18Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4541) Google Scholar). This is exemplified by the observation that the expression of leptin in WAT is acutely reduced by fasting (19Trayhurn P. Thomas M.E. Duncan J.S. Rayner D.V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 488-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 20Vidal-Puig A. Jimenez-Linan M. Lowell B.B. Hamann A. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Flier J.S. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2553-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), suggesting that leptin is also involved in short term metabolic regulation. In contrast to leptin, expression of FIAF is up-regulated during fasting. Furthermore, the abundance of FIAF in plasma is decreased with high fat feeding and increased WAT mass, an effect directly opposite to that observed with leptin (18Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4541) Google Scholar). Finally, leptin is a negative target of PPARγ and is overexpressed in WAT of PPARγ +/− mice (16Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Satoh S. Nakano R. Ishii C. Sugiyama T. Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Okuno A. Murakami K. Sekihara H. Hasegawa G. Naito M. Toyoshima Y. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Kitamura T.

Briggs M.R. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), whereas FIAF mRNA is down-regulated in these mice. Although it remains speculative to suggest that FIAF and leptin have antagonistic functions, the opposite regulation between leptin and FIAF expression/production during various nutritional states and by PPARγ is nevertheless very interesting. Our data clearly show that the expression of FIAF is strongly increased during fasting in both liver and WAT. This, together with the observation that expression of FIAF is increased by PPARα, whose critical involvement in the adaptive response to fasting has been well established (3Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 4Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), suggests that FIAF is mainly important under fasting conditions. Interestingly, PPARα deletion had no effect on FIAF expression in the liver of fasted mice, a phenomenon that was previously observed for other PPARα target genes such as short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and carnitine palmitoyl acyl-transferase I, which are genes whose expression is strongly stimulated by fasting as well (3Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Most likely, the loss of PPARα dependence can be ascribed to other signaling pathways activated during fasting, which override the effect of PPARα. FIAF expression was found to be somewhat higher in WAT of PPARα null mice than wild-type mice (mainly evident in the fed state). This could either reflect a negative regulation of FIAF expression by PPARα in WAT (either directly or via other transcription factors) or a consequence of the metabolic derangements present in PPARα null mice. Increased expression levels of genes implicated in metabolism in WAT of PPARα null mice have been observed previously. 2S. Kersten and W. Wahli, unpublished data. Future research will have to establish more precisely what role FIAF plays in the metabolic response to fasting. The closest family members of FIAF, the angiopoietins, are secreted proteins that acts as ligands for receptor-like tyrosine kinases such as TIE2 (23Suri C. Jones P.F. Patan S. Bartunkova S. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar, 24Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A.

Similar to the angiopoietins, it is likely that FIAF exerts its effect distant from its site of production, probably by binding to some kind of receptor. The detection of FIAF in plasma suggests that FIAF's mode of action is endocrine, rather than autocrine or paracrine, although this remains to be proven. At the present time, no information is available regarding the molecular target of FIAF or about its target tissue(s). It was observed that the abundance of FIAF in plasma is decreased on a chronic high fat diet. Remarkably, this was not accompanied by changes in mRNA expression in two major FIAF-producing tissues, liver and WAT. Besides being possibly caused by post-transcriptional effects, it is also conceivable that a high fat diet lowers plasma FIAF abundance by increasing its rate of breakdown. In the absence of any information on the identity and location of the putative FIAF receptor, this hypothesis would be very difficult to test. It is remarkable that, despite much higher mRNA expression levels in WAT, FIAF protein seems to be more highly present in liver and kidney. One possibility that could explain this apparent discrepancy is that FIAF protein is stored in the latter tissues, whereas it is immediately secreted after synthesis in WAT. Alternatively, it is conceivable that the concentrated presence of FIAF protein in liver and kidney reflects uptake rather than production. Again, to test this hypothesis, more information about the target tissues of FIAF is needed. While this manuscript was in preparation, Kim et al. (25Kim I. Kim H.-G. Kim H. Kim H.-H. Park S.K. Uhm C.-S. Lee Z.L. Koh G.Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) reported on a hepatic fibrinogen/angiopoietin-related protein (HFARP) that is identical to our FIAF. As was found for FIAF, HFARP was secreted by COS-7 cells and was detected in circulating blood. The highest expression of HFARP was found in the liver, but WAT and BAT, where we found much higher expression levels, were omitted. According to these authors, HFARP acts as an apoptosis survival factor for vascular endothelial cells. It is not easy to reconcile this function with the predominant expression of FIAF/HFARP in adipose tissue and its marked up-regulation by fasting. Given the large divergence in sequence between FIAF and angiopoietins, these proteins are likely to have quite different functions. In conclusion, we have isolated a novel gene that is a PPARα target gene in liver, and probably a PPARγ target gene in WAT, that encodes the secreted protein FIAF. Its high expression in adipose tissue and its up-regulation by fasting suggest an involvement of FIAF in the metabolic response to fasting. Moreover, its plasma levels are reduced by chronic high fat feeding. Future studies are needed to establish more precisely the role of FIAF in energy homeostasis."

This superfamily is bound by similar primary and secondary predicted protein structures and hydropathy profiles. A PROSITE-formatted regular expression was generated that is highly predictive for identifying members of this superfamily using PHI-BLAST. The superfamily is named PID (proliferation,ion, and death) because prohibitins are involved in proliferation and cell cycle control, stomatins are involved in ion channel regulation, and the plant defense-related genes are involved in cell death. The plant defense gene family is named HIR (hypersensitive induced reaction) because its members are associated with hypersensitive reactions involving cell death and pathogen resistance. For this study, eight novel maize genes were introduced: four closely related to prohibitins (Zm-phb1, Zm-phb2, Zm-phb3, and Zm-phb4), one to stomatins (Zm-stm1), and three to a gene implicated in plant disease responses (Zm-hir1, Zm-hir2, and Zm-hir3). The maize Zm-hir3 gene transcript is up-regulated in a disease lesion mimic mutation (Les9), supporting a role in maize defense responses.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12094-12097Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The HR cell death phenomenon bears similarities to programmed cell death or apoptosis observed in animals (3Greenberg J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12094-12097Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). A group of tobacco genes were identified that caused the formation of HR-like lesions on tobacco leaves when ectopically expressed from a tobacco mosaic virus expression vector (4Karrer E.E. Beachy R.N. Holt C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One of these genes, represented by a cDNA called NG1, caused both HR-like lesion formation and induced expression of β-glucanase, a pathogenesis-related protein marker for defense activation. NG1 was thus interpreted to be a novel activator of the plant HR defense system (4Karrer E.E. Beachy R.N. Holt C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The predicted peptide for the cDNA NG1 was presented as 64 amino acids with no significant homology to any known proteins (4Karrer E.E. Beachy R.N. Holt C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Independently, an Arabidopsis NG1-like cDNA (gene 106) was reported to represent an mRNA induced by the plant defense activator isonicotinic acid (5Ryals, J. A., Alexander, D. C., Beck, J. J., Duesing, J. H., Goodman, R. M., Friedrich, L. B., Harms, C., Meins, F., Jr., Montoya, A., Moyer, M. B., Neuhaus, J.-M., Payne, G. B., Sperisen, C., Stinson, J. R., Uknes, S. J., Ward, E.

Ryals J. Stacey G. Keen N.T. Plant-Microbe Interactions. Chapman and Hall, Inc., New York1996: 81-106Google Scholar) and occurred independent of de novo protein synthesis (5Ryals, J.

Prohibitins are a group of highly conserved proteins that are thought to control the cell cycle, senescence, and tumor suppression (reviewed in Ref. 7McClung J.K. Jupe E.R. Dell'Orco R.T. Exp. Gerontol. 1995; 30: 99-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Prohibitins negatively control the cell cycle in the early G1 phase and specifically inhibit initiation of DNA synthesis (8Nuell M.J. Stewart D.A. Walker L. Friedman V. Wood C.M. Owens G.A. Smith J.R. Schneider E.L. Dell'Orco R. Lumpkin C.K. Danner D.B. McClung J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1372-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 9Roskams A.J.I. Friedman V. Wood C.M.

Prohibitin genes appear to be expressed in many tissues and organisms, but with some modulation of expression consistent with a role in the cell cycle (7McClung J.K. Jupe E.R. Dell'Orco R.T. Exp. Gerontol. 1995; 30: 99-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 8Nuell M.J. Stewart D.A. Walker L. Friedman V. Wood C.M. Owens G.A. Smith J.R. Schneider E.L. Dell'Orco R. Lumpkin C.K.

Reprod. 1993; 49: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutations or deletions of prohibitin are linked to some human breast and ovarian cancers, supporting the idea that prohibitin suppresses tumors as part of its antiproliferative function involving cell cycle control (11Legget B.

Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Prohibitins are also implicated in controlling senescence and aging, with which there may be a functional link to their antiproliferative function and cell cycle control (7McClung J.K. Jupe E.R. Dell'Orco R.T. Exp. Gerontol. 1995; 30: 99-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Prohibitins are localized largely in the mitochondria, especially in the inner mitochondrial membrane (7McClung J.K. Jupe E.R. Dell'Orco R.T. Exp. Gerontol. 1995; 30: 99-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) near the periphery (14Ikonen E. Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Rat and human prohibitins possess a short transmembrane helix near their N termini, which may be integrated into mitochondrial membranes (7McClung J.K. Jupe E.R. Dell'Orco R.T. Exp. Gerontol. 1995; 30: 99-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As mitochondrial inner membrane proteins often control ion transport and ATP production, it has been speculated that prohibitins may be involved in these processes, in particular in mitochondrial calcium efflux, which regulates ATP formation (7McClung J.K. Jupe E.R. Dell'Orco R.T. Exp. Gerontol. 1995; 30: 99-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Prohibitin and the prohibitin-like protein BAP37 (also called prohibitone) have also been localized to the plasma membrane of mouse lymphocytes, where they together interact with the IgM antigen receptor and may function in signaling apoptotic programmed cell death (15Terashima M. Kim K.-M. Adachi T. Nielsen P. Reth M. Kohler G. Lamers M.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3782-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Prohibitin and BAP37 interact directly with each other in animal mitochondria; and in yeast, they control replicative life span, possibly through control of mitochondrial membrane ionic potential (16Coates P.J. Jameison D.J. Smart K. Prescott A.R. Hall PA. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stomatin is an integral membrane protein found in red blood cells. In genetic disorders in which this protein is missing, a hemolytic anemia called stomatocytosis results. In stomatocytosis, the red blood cells experience high passive diffusion of univalent cations and are often overhydrated due to an abnormally high amount of intracellular sodium and low amounts of potassium. These red blood cells assume a mouth-like shape, thus stomatocytosis, from “stoma,” which is Greek for mouth (17Stewart G.W. Argent A.C. Dash B.C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1225: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Stomatin is thought to function as a negative regulator of univalent cation permeability. Stomatin has a single membrane-spanning region near its N terminus, with the rest of the protein thought to be cytoplasmic (18Stewart G.W. Hepworth-Jones B.E. Keen J.N. Dash B.C.J. Argent A.C. Casimir C.M. Blood. 1992; 79: 1593-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism for stomatin function is unknown, but its cytoplasmic portion has been suggested to act as a ball and chain tether that can directly plug ion channels and may also interact with the cytoskeleton (17Stewart G.W. Argent A.C. Dash B.C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1225: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Northern blots detect stomatin mRNA expression in many human tissues besides red blood cells (18Stewart G.W. Hepworth-Jones B.E. Keen J.N. Dash B.C.J. Argent A.C. Casimir C.M. Blood. 1992; 79: 1593-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we present eight novel full-length cDNA sequences from maize, four of which are closely related to prohibitins, three to the hypersensitive response-inducing protein NG1, and one to stomatins. We demonstrate that these eight novel plant genes, along with many animal, bacterial, plant, and fungal sequences representing prohibitins, NG1-like proteins, stomatins, and other membrane proteins, compose a novel protein superfamily. Although these genes are involved in diverse physiological processes, their structural similarity suggests that they possess a related biochemical function. The eight full-length maize cDNAs presented in this study were identified in the EST collection at Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. mRNA sources were from various tissues and treatments. The cDNA libraries were created at Pioneer Hi-Bred, and the ESTs were generated at Human Genome Sciences. The NG1 (HIR), prohibitin, and stomatin homologs were identified with the aid of the IRIS software package from Human Genome Sciences, which includes the BLAST algorithm, through which homology was indicated to tobacco NG1 (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number U66271), to prohibitins from various species, and to human stomatin (accession number U33925). Full-length insert sequences were produced at Pioneer Hi-Bred by primer walking using an ABI 377 sequencing machine. Sequences were assembled using SequencherTM Version 3.0 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and/or AssemblyLIGNTM (Eastman Kodak Co.) software. Initial public database searches were carried out using the BLASTP program (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70731) Google Scholar) with a chickpea HIR-like gene (NCBI Protein Database accession number gi 3928150) as a probe, followed by PSI-BLAST (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59923) Google Scholar) with default parameters (Blosum 62, gap existence cost 11, per residue gap cost 1, λ ratio = 0.85, expect threshold 10). About 24 sequences that appeared as significant hits, both in terms of statistical threshold and the type, were, along with the eight maize sequences presented herein, multiply aligned by the ClustalW program with default parameters (21Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55757) Google Scholar). The residues were reduced to a consensus sequence according to an 80% consensus generated using the CONSENSUS program of Nigel Brown (NIMR, London). To look for conserved motifs in the 32 members included in the multiple alignment, we applied the MEME algorithm, which resulted in the detection of three highly conserved motifs (26Grundy W.N. Bailey T.L. Elkan C.P. Baker M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Highly conserved residues based in part on the MEME motifs were identified to generate a PROSITE-formatted regular expression profile to perform further data base searches by the PHI-BLAST program (22Zhang Z. Schäffer A. Miller W. Madden T.L. Lipman D.J. Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3986-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis was carried out by using an option within ClustalW (23Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) to generate multiple alignments, followed by distance calculations and tree constructions with the PROTDIST and neighbor-joining program of the PHYLIP package (24Felsenstein J. PHYLIP Phylogeny Inference Package , Version 3.5c. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle1993Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions were carried out by the DSC algorithm using multiple sequence inputs (25King R.D. Saqi M. Sayle R. Sternberg M.J.E. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 473-474PubMed Google Scholar). Further structural analyses were carried out by hydropathy profiles using the Kyte-Doolittle method with a 19-residue sliding window. Plant material for mRNA expression analysis was produced from the following three maize families, each with the Les9 mutation (a disease lesion mutation of maize) segregating 1:1 among the progeny: family 1 (Mo95 18-15 × sibling wild-type +/Les9; background M14/Mo20W), family 2 (Mo94S 16-35 × sibling wild-type +/Les9; background M14W23/W23r), and family 3 (Mo95 24-3 × sibling wild-type +/Les9; background M14/W23). Of the three families, only family 1 with the Mo20W background suppresses the Les9 lesion mimic phenotype. For the Affymetrix GeneChip® analysis, wild-type andLes9 mutant plants from all three families were used. Plants were grown in soil in the greenhouse to the V8 stage, which is when the characteristic Les9 lesions normally begin to appear. The young, upper leaf of Les9 phenotype plants that did not yet express a lesion phenotype on that leaf and corresponding tissue from wild-type sibling plants were harvested. Using duplicate equal 2-g samples representing each of these six tissues, total RNA was isolated by the TriReagent® method according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Pooled tissue from three different plants formed one sample, and the plants used for each sample were distinct. For GeneChip® expression analysis, 1 mg of total RNA from each sample was used for poly(A)+ mRNA isolation by the OligoTex resin binding method according to the manufacturer's recommendations (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Protocols for preparing in vitro transcribed biotinylated cRNA probes from poly(A)+ mRNA for Affymetrix GeneChip® gene expression analysis were according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and have been described (27Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.-H. Lockhart D.J. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). In brief, 2 μg of poly(A)+mRNA/sample, described above in mRNA isolations, was used for the first strand cDNA synthesis. This involved a T7-(dT)24 oligonucleotide primer and reverse transcriptase SuperScript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). The second strand synthesis involved Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Life Technologies, Inc.). The double-stranded cDNA was then cleaned up using phenol/chloroform extraction and phase-lock gels (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), followed by ethanol precipitation. For thein vitro transcription to produce cRNA, biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP, in addition to all four NTPs, were used with T7 transcriptase (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). The in vitrotranscript product was cleaned up using RNeasy affinity resin columns (QIAGEN Inc.). In vitro labeled transcript yields ranged from 60 to 80 μg/sample. They were stored at −80 °C until used. The in vitro transcript products were fragmented in acetate buffer (pH 8.1) at 94 °C for 35 min prior to chip hybridization. Equal amounts (12 μg/sample) of in vitrolabeled transcript were used to probe each chip overnight. The biotinylated RNA hybridizing to the chips was labeled with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate and scanned using a confocal fluorescence microscope. Expression intensity was determined as described (27Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.-H. Lockhart D.J. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Comparisons of mRNA abundance (cRNA abundance) were made per repetition between the Les9 and wild-type samples. The average -fold change and S.E. for all the repetitions per family were calculated and are presented. The GeneChip® used in these experiments was constructed by Affymetrix using a set of 1501 maize cDNA ESTs, representing nearly as many genes. The genes used to produce this GeneChip®encompass many physiological processes; perhaps one-third could be defense-related based on their homology to known or suspected defense-related genes. Two of the 1501 ESTs representedZm-hir3 (ESTs CMSAR19R and CBPCC63R). Each cRNA GeneChip® probing was replicated two or three times (repetitions A, B, and C). In brief, the 1.28 × 1.28-cm GeneChip® contains a high density array of 20-mer oligonucleotides affixed to a silicon wafer. These oligonucleotides were synthesized in situ on the silicon wafer by a light-dependent combinatorial chemical synthesis (27Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.-H. Lockhart D.J. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide sequences are complementary to the sense strand of cDNA ESTs from Pioneer Hi-Bred. For each gene, there are up to 40 20-mer oligonucleotides synthesized. Twenty of these oligonucleotides are exact matches to different, although sometimes overlapping, regions of the EST. The other 20 oligonucleotides contain one base mismatch in the center, which changes hybridization efficiency. (For a minority of genes, there were <20 oligonucleotide probe pairs, but never <15 pairs per gene.) The perfect match and mismatch oligonucleotide probe pairs for each gene are tiled in adjacent regions of the GeneChip®. Comparisons of the hybridization intensities between different perfect match oligonucleotides for a given gene and between perfect match to mismatch hybridization intensities for an oligonucleotide pair are used to determine the overall hybridization to the gene and hence its level of mRNA abundance in the samples (27Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.-H. Lockhart D.J. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, tissues from wild-type and Les9mutant plants from family 3 were used. Plants were grown in soil in the greenhouse to the V8 stage. Leaf blades (minus midribs) that had developed Les9 lesions on the mature half of the leaf tissue were harvested and divided into the basal lesion-free zone; the transition zone, where lesions were starting to form; and the leaf tip, where lesions had reached a mature stage. Corresponding tissues from wild-type siblings were also harvested. Ten micrograms of total RNA was mixed with running dye containing ethidium bromide and electrophoresed at 60 V for 15 h on 0.8% agarose gels in MOPS containing formaldehyde essentially as described (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). The gels were blotted onto nylon-backed nitrocellulose membrane and probed with a 1.35-kilobase pair insert from the CMSAR19R cDNA representingZm-hir3. Three distinct maize cDNAs with high homology to the tobacco NG1 peptide (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession numberU66271) were identified in the EST collection at Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., and their complete full-length sequences were produced. These three genes were named Zm-hir1 (accession number AF236373), Zm-hir2 (accession number AF236374), andZm-hir3 (accession number AF236375) for Z ea m ays hypersensitiveinduced reaction genes 1,2, and 3, respectively. Initial searches of maize hir genes using the BLAST program (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70731) Google Scholar) against the public data bases indicated some similarity to prohibitins and stomatins, which prompted a search for maize cDNA clones related to prohibitins and stomatins from the same EST collection. Four distinct full-length prohibitin-like maize clones were identified and sequenced, namely Zm-phb1 (accession number AF236368),Zm-phb2 (accession number AF236369), Zm-phb3(accession number AF236370), and Zm-phb4 (accession numberAF236371). In addition, one full-length stomatin-like clone, namedZm-stm1 (accession number AF236372), was also identified and sequenced. Public data base searches did not reveal a previously reported plant stomatin-like gene. Pairwise alignments of the three maize HIR proteins showed high levels of similarity among themselves (>80% identity) and to HIR-like proteins from tobacco, chickpea, andArabidopsis (>80% identity). Pairwise amino acid similarities of plant HIR and HIR-like proteins with maize prohibitins were between 28 and 36%, and those with maize stomatinZm-stm1 were between 34 and 37%. This suggested that the maize HIR proteins were somewhat closer in amino acid sequence to stomatins than to prohibitins. The non-redundant protein data base at NCBI was searched using the PSI-BLAST program (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59923) Google Scholar) with a hypothetical protein from chickpea (accession number gi 3928150) as a probe, which has >90% amino acid similarity to the maize HIR proteins. This search identified many genes, including stomatins and integral membrane proteins (E < 10−16), prohibitins (E < 10−8), and HFLK/HFLC proteins (E < 10−6). Twenty-four of these public sequences, along with the eight maize sequences introduced above, were used to generate an unrooted dendogram (Fig. 1). This dendogram revealed a large superfamily with at least four constituent families. The stomatins and integral membrane proteins, including a mechanosensor protein from Caenorhabditis elegans (accession number gi 2493263), formed a large family containing sequences from diverse phyla. A second family was composed of HIR and HIR-like sequences from plants. The family consisting of stomatins and integral membrane proteins was most closely related to the HIR family. The third family was composed of prohibitins and related sequences from diverse phyla. The bacterial membrane proteins HFLK/HFLC formed a small fourth family. Amino acid sequences for 32 members of this superfamily were also multiply aligned to reveal shared and diverged features (Fig.2). The coding region lengths for the HIR proteins (242–286 amino acids) are comparable to those of prohibitins (272–289 amino acids) and many of the stomatins and other membrane-associated proteins (249–481 amino acids). Relative to prohibitins and stomatins, the HIR proteins are typically shorter at the N terminus. Several regions of the protein superfamily are highly conserved and aligned well with fewer gaps. Two residues, Asp and Ala (corresponding to amino acids 64 and 167, respectively, in Zm-HIR1, being used here as a reference superfamily member), are completely conserved among all the proteins, suggesting a critical role for these residues in the biological function of these proteins. Other amino acids and structural groups of amino acids are also conserved in the PID superfamily, as shown in the consensus sequence (Fig. 2). Also depicted in Fig. 2 are the consensus DSC predicted secondary structures of each of the families within the PID superfamily. Each of the four families within the PID superfamily share secondary structural features in the same general relative positions, further indicating a relationship between these proteins.Figure 2Fig. 2. Multiple sequence alignment and consensus and DSC secondary structure predictions for the PID superfamily. A multiple alignment of 32 amino acid sequences for representative members of the PID superfamily was constructed by the ClustalW program and then manually refined: HIR proteins (green bar), stomatins and membrane proteins (red bar), HFLK proteins (brown bar), and prohibitins (blue bar). Highlighted are identical (red) or similar (blue) residues shared by at least three families within the PID superfamily. The alignment was used to generate a consensus sequence, which spans the region corresponding to amino acids 1–253 on Zm-HIR1. The consensus sequence at the bottom was based on conservation of a residue at any given position in >80% of sequences. Amino acids conserved 80% or more are shown in uppercase red letters, and two 100% conserved amino acids (Asp and Ala) are shown in uppercase andred-underlined letters. The abbreviations for amino acid structural groups are in lowercase letters as follows: o, alcohol (Ser, Thr); l, aliphatic (Ile, Leu, Val); a, aromatic (Phe, Trp, Tyr);c, charged (Asp, Glu, His, Lys, Arg); h, hydrophobic (Ala, Cys, Phe, Gly, His, Ile, Lys, Leu); −, negative (Asp, Glu); p, polar (Cys, Asp, Glu, His, Lys, Asn, Gln, Arg, Ser, Thr); +, positive (His, Lys, Arg); s, small (Ala, Ser, Thr, Val); u, tiny (Ala, Gly, Ser); t, turn-like (Ala, Cys, Asp, Glu, Gly, His, Lys, Asn, Gln, Arg, Ser, Thr); and dot, any residue or gap. The location of the PID superfamily regular expression is identified by arrows. The location of the stomatin PROSITE signature is similarly indicated. Shown below the consensus sequence is the secondary structure predictions that were carried out using the latest version of the DSC algorithm (44Ross K.D. Sternberg M.J.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2298-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), the prediction accuracy of which is >72%: DSC_ALL, DSC_HIR, DSC_PHB, DSC_STM, and DSC_HFLK represent consensus predictions for all the PID superfamily sequences and all the members of the respective families of HIR proteins, prohibitins, stomatins, and HFLK proteins, respectively.

The MEME motifs have been indicated as reliable indicators of family membership (26Grundy W.N. Bailey T.L. Elkan C.P. Baker M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The search resulted in the identification of three conserved motifs (Fig. 2). Using Zm-HIR1 as reference again, the amino acid positions of these motifs are as follows: motif 1, 108–167; motif 2, 56–80; and motif 3, 23–88. The relative spatial positions of these three motifs in all these genes appear to be spatially well conserved, indicating the possibility for a similar structural orientation in three-dimensional space. Motif 2 is a subset of motif 3 and is conserved in all members in the alignment. All three motifs are present in all members of the superfamily, except the HFLK/HFLC proteins, which contain only motif 2. HFLK and HFLC are bacterial membrane proteins with protease activity and are involved in lysogenization. They ap"

We have recently shown that RGS proteins may be regulated on a post-translational level (Benzing, T., Brandes, R., Sellin, L., Schermer, B., Lecker, S., Walz, G., and Kim, E. (1999) Nat.

Binding of 14-3-3 is mediated by a conserved phosphoserine located in the Gα-interacting portion of the RGS domain; interaction with 14-3-3 inhibits the GAP activity of RGS7, depends upon phosphorylation of a conserved residue within the RGS domain, and results in inhibition of GAP function. Collectively, these data indicate that phosphorylation-dependent binding of 14-3-3 may act as molecular switch that controls the GAP activity keeping a substantial fraction of RGS proteins in a dormant state.

Here we show that RGS3 and RGS7 contain a functional 14-3-3-binding site within their RGS domains and that a significant fraction of both proteins normally exists bound to endogenous 14-3-3. The binding of RGS3 and RGS7 to 14-3-3 is phosphorylation-dependent; the primary 14-3-3-binding site in RGS7 involves serine 434, a region implicated in interactions with Gα subunits and displaying sequence conservation with other RGS family members. Furthermore, phosphorylation and subsequent interaction with 14-3-3 results in a progressive decline in the GAP activity of RGS proteins. Our data suggest that regulated phosphorylation/14-3-3 binding and dephosphorylation within the RGS domain could function as a molecular switch to turn off and on the GAP function of RGS proteins in vivo.

Kehrl) were generated by polymerase chain reaction and standard cloning techniques. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to insert mutations in RGS7. Point mutations were verified by sequence analysis. A GST.14-3-3τ, kindly provided by Dr. Y.-C. Liu, was utilized to generate Myc-, Flag-, and MBP-tagged versions. In some experiments, an extended Myc-tagged 14-3-3τ version was used to differentiate transfected from endogenous 14-3-3 protein; this construct contained eight additional amino acids (ERDSRGSL) at the COOH terminus. m2 muscarinic receptor (OB-m2) was a kind gift of Dr. Silvio Gutkind. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described (18Kim E. Arnould T. Sellin L. Benzing T. Comella N. Kocher O. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method. After incubation for 24 h, cells were washed twice and lysed in a 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. After centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 15 min, 4 °C) cell lysates containing equal amounts of total protein were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody followed by incubation with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (mouse monoclonal antibodies) or protein A-Sepharose (rabbit polyclonal antisera) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for approximately 3 h. The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer and bound proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA as indicated. After 24 h methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum was applied for 30 min, then 1 mCi of Tran35S-Label (ICN) containing [35S]methionine/cysteine was added for 6 h. Cells were harvested, lysates immunoprecipitated, and precipitates subjected to SDS-PAGE. Densitometric analysis of nonsaturating autoradiographs utilizing NIH image software was corrected for the number of incorporated methionines and cysteines of the respective proteins. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with F.RGS3. After incubation with staurosporine cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 15 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors for 15 min on ice. Following centrifugation the supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 6 μg of recombinant purified GST.14-3-3τ prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and RGS3 was visualized with anti-Flag antibody. Equal loading of GST.14-3-3τ was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. For preparation of brain protein extracts whole brains of female BALB/c mice (20 g in body weight, Charles River) were removed and homogenized in 4 ml of brain lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 40 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 15 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, containing protease inhibitor mixture and 44 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice. Following centrifugation and ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min), the supernatant was divided into 2 fractions and immunoprecipitated with specific anti-RGS7 antiserum and control antibody followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose. Resulting precipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-14-3-3 mAb (Santa Cruz) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antiserum and enhanced chemiluminescence. GST and GST.14-3-3τ fusion protein was immobilized on affinity chromatography minicolumns (Bio-Rad) using glutathione-Sepharose beads; columns were washed extensively and pre-equilibrated by three washes with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 50 mm NaF, 15 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) at 4 °C. Whole brains of healthy adult WKY rats were frozen in liquid nitrogen, homogenized in 4 ml of lysis buffer, incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 20 min. Supernatants were loaded on a GST or a GST.14-3-3τ column. Flow-through (identical volumes) was subjected SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-RGS7 antiserum, PKCα, and β-catenin antibodies. In vitro phosphorylation of GST.RGS7315–469 and MBP.RGS7315–469 was performed for 30 min at 37 °C in a 100-μl reaction in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 100 μm ATP, 20 μg/ml diacylglycerol, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.03% Triton X-100, and the indicated amount of recombinant RGS7 protein. The phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 0.5 units of recombinant protein kinase C-α (1850 units/mg, Panvera) in enzyme dilution buffer or enzyme dilution buffer alone (control). To monitor the incorporation of phosphate, the unlabeled ATP was supplemented with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and radiolabeled MBP.RGS7315–469 or GST.RGS7315–469 was visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or spotted on nitrocellulose filter and counted in a scintillation counter. For in vitrointeraction studies, purified recombinant protein (1 μg of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated GST.RGS7315–469 or GST alone) was immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with bacterial lysates containing 2.5 μg/ml recombinant MBP.14-3-3τ for 90 min in 450 μl of binding buffer containing 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. The washed precipitate was separated on a 10% SDS acrylamide gel. Bound MBP.14-3-3τ was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-MBP rabbit antiserum (New England Biolabs). For fluorescence polarization assays GST.14-3-3τ fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (19Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S.

Fluorescent peptides were synthesized usingN-α-Fmoc-protected amino acids and standard BOP/HOBt coupling chemistry on an ABI 431A Peptide BioSynthesizer, with fluorescein isothiocyanate connected to the peptide amino terminus via a β-alanine linker. Fluorescence polarization anisotropy was measured using a Panvera Beacon 2000 Variable Temperature Fluorescence Polarization System. Low fluorescence buffers and reagents (Panvera Corp.) were used throughout. Binding curves were measured independently in three separate experiments. 14-3-3 proteins were serially diluted (0–223 μm) to a final volume of 150 μl in phosphate-buffered saline in 6 × 50-mm borosilicate glass tubes. Fluorescein-tagged peptide was added (59 nm final concentration), mixed, and fluorescence polarization measured at 22 °C after a 120-s delay with a 16-s integration. Background fluorescence was measured for each sample prior to peptide addition. Binding data was analyzed by assuming that fluorescence polarization was a linear function of ligand binding (21Jameson D.M. Sawyer W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and that each 14-3-3 monomer contained a single peptide-binding site (19Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R.

Curves were fit to the equation: L B /L tot =L f /(k D + L f ), where L B is bound ligand,L tot is total ligand, L f is free ligand and k D is the dissociation constant, in closed form using nonlinear regression analysis (Kaleidograph). Single turnover GTPase activity measurements were carried out as described (22Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

Recombinant myristoylated Gαi1 subunits (Calbiochem, 250 nm) were loaded with [γ-32P]GTP (1.0 μm) for 20 min at 30 °C in 500 μl of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% Lubrol. The stoichiometry of GTP binding of Gαi1 subunits was 25–40%. For zero time point a 12.5-μl aliquot was removed and added to 375 μl of 5% (w/v) Norit in 50 mm NaH2PO4. GTP hydrolysis was initiated at 4 °C by adding 150 μl of the loaded Gαi1 subunits on ice to MgCl2 (15 mm final concentration) and unlabeled GTP (150 μm final concentration), with or without purified, phosphorylated or unphosphorylated MPB.RGS7315–469 (1.0 μm final concentration), that was preincubated with GST or GST.14-3-3τ (final concentration 5 μm, 30 min on ice) as indicated. Aliquots of 25 μl were removed from the hydrolysis reaction, mixed with 375 μl of 5% (w/v) Norit in 50 mmNaH2PO4 on ice, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Zero time values were subtracted from all experimental points. Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical and curve fitting functions of SigmaPlot 4.01 (Jandel Scientific). Hydrolysis rate constants were calculated according to Wang et al. (27Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To demonstrate statistical significance of differences in GTP hydrolysis, hydrolysis rate constants were normalized, expressed as fold increase of basal hydrolysis rate constant, and averages of these constants were depicted in a table. For the determination of ERK1/2 phosphorylation HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid DNA as indicated. After transfection cells were serum-starved overnight and incubated in the absence/presence of carbachol. After 15 min the stimulation was stopped by placing the cells on ice and exchange of the media with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were harvested, lysed in a 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 15 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and equal amounts of protein were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Dually phosphorylated ERK1/2 was visualized with phosphospecific antisera (New England Biolabs) that detects ERK1/2 only when phosphorylated at threonine 202 and tyrosine 204 (Thr(P)-E-Tyr(P) motif). Equal loading was confirmed by reprobing the membrane with β-actin and Amido Black staining. The degree of dual phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was quantitated by densitometric analysis of non-saturated radiographs with the NIH Image software. To test whether 14-3-3 binds and regulates RGS proteins we used RGS3, RGS7, 14-3-3τ, and 14-3-3β as model proteins. Both RGS3 and RGS7 specifically interacted with 14-3-3 proteins in transfected HEK 293T cells (Fig. 1). Epitope-tagged 14-3-3 co-precipitated with RGS3 and RGS7 but not with control proteins and vice versa. Truncations of RGS3 and RGS7 were generated to localize the site of interaction with 14-3-3 to the RGS domains (Fig. 1,a and e). To more quantitatively assess the amount of RGS3 complexed with 14-3-3 we labeled transiently transfected HEK 293T cells with [35S]methionine/cysteine. Immunoprecipitation from labeled cells revealed that approximately 70% of the immunoprecipitated RGS3 was complexed with 14-3-3τ (Fig.2 a). Since immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged 14-3-3τ immobilized only 15% of the RGS3, it appears that most of the RGS3 is bound to 14-3-3, whereas the majority of 14-3-3τ is complexed with other cellular proteins. 14-3-3 proteins generally recognize their ligands only following serine/threonine phosphorylation (19Yaffe M.B.

We therefore examined whether treatment of HEK 293T cells with staurosporine, a broad spectrum inhibitor of protein kinases, would prevent the phosphorylation of RGS proteins and their subsequent interaction with 14-3-3. Staurosporine nearly abrogated the interaction between RGS3 and 14-3-3 in vivoand in vitro. Only trace amounts of 14-3-3τ were co-immunoprecipitated in staurosporine-treated HEK 293T cells (Fig.2 b). Similarly, treatment of RGS3-expressing HEK 293T cells with staurosporine dramatically reduced binding of RGS3 to immobilized 14-3-3τ in vitro (Fig. 2 c). Note that the staurosporine treatment did not cause a nonspecific reduction in the cellular amounts of either RGS3 or 14-3-3τ (Fig. 2 b andc, lower panels). Similar experiments with RGS7 were precluded by the destabilization of RGS7 by staurosporine treatment. Both RGS7 and 14-3-3 are highly abundant in mouse brain. When we examined their endogenous interaction by co-immunoprecipitation of mouse brain lysates (Fig.3 a), 14-3-3 specifically co-precipitated with RGS7 indicating an endogenous in vivointeraction (Fig. 3 b). To quantitatively assess the capacity of endogenous RGS7 to interact with 14-3-3, we determined the fraction of endogenous RGS7 retained by a recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-14-3-3 fusion protein immobilized to a glutathione-Sepharose column. Unbound RGS7 was measured in the flow-through by immunoblotting; PKCα and β-catenin levels were used to correct for unspecific binding and equal loading (Fig.3 c). More than 50% of the RGS7 contained in brain lysates was retained on a GST.14-3-3τ column (Fig. 3 d). Collectively, these data indicate that RGS3 and RGS7 interact with 14-3-3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This interaction does not only occur in transfected cells but can also be demonstrated with endogenous proteins. Furthermore, the data suggest that a substantial fraction of RGS proteins is bound to 14-3-3 in vivo.Figure 2The interaction of RGS proteins with 14-3-3 is phosphorylation-dependent. a, autoradiograph after in vivo labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and immunoprecipitation of transiently transfected HEK 293T cells with anti-Flag or anti-Myc antibodies.

Replacement of the serine residue at position 434 of RGS7 by alanine completely abolished binding of 14-3-3τ to both full-length RGS7 and to the isolated RGS domain (RGS7315–469) (Fig. 1, d and e). To demonstrate that phosphorylation of serine 434 is required for the interaction of RGS7 and 14-3-3, the interaction of 14-3-3 with unphosphorylated and phosphorylated RGS7 was tested in vitro. As expected, no interaction was detectable between bacterially expressed, unphosphorylated RGS7315–469 fused to GST (GST.RGS7315–469) and 14-3-3τ fused to MBP (MBP.14-3-3τ) (Fig. 4 a), whereas phosphorylation by PKCα enabled GST.RGS7315–469to bind MBP.14-3-3τ. Replacement of serine 434 in RGS7 by aspartate to mimic serine phosphorylation facilitated a constitutive association between RGS7 and 14-3-3 that remained unaffected by subsequent phosphorylation with PKCα (data not shown), suggesting that serine 434 is the relevant PKCα phosphorylation site. Fluorescence polarization measurements confirmed that 14-3-3τ rapidly binds to a 14-mer phosphopeptide containing the serine 434 14-3-3-binding site of RGS7 with a k D of 15.9 μm (Fig. 4 b and c). Most published affinities for 14-3-3 interacting peptide sequences range from 0.1 to 2 μm, using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore); however, the interpretation of these affinities is complicated by an avidity effect since dimeric 14-3-3 may simultaneously bind to two phosphopeptides immobilized on the Biacore chip (19Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar), while the fluorescence polarization experiments were performed with solubilized molecules. Given the strong interaction of 14-3-3 with RGS7 and RGS3 in the co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments, this moderatek D suggests that additional factors such as dimerization of RGS proteins or tandem binding of 14-3-3 may contribute to the interaction of RGS proteins with 14-3-3 in vivo. Indeed, both RGS3 and RGS7 contain at least two additional potential 14-3-3-binding sites in close proximity within the RGS domain. Although our data clearly implicate serine 434 as a critical 14-3-3 binding residue in RGS7, it is conceivable that simultaneous binding to additional sites increases the affinity and stability of this interaction. Several 14-3-3 binding proteins such as c-Raf-1, Cbl, and BAD contain two 14-3-3 binding sequences separated by polypeptide segments of various length, and tandem binding to adjacent 14-3-3 sites has been shown to facilitate the formation of a high-affinity, bidentate complex (19Yaffe M.B.

Based on the resolution crystal structure of RGS4 complexed with activated Gαi subunits (26Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) the 14-3-3 binding site at serine 434 in RGS7 aligns with one of the three putative domains required for Gαi1 interaction and stimulation of GTPase activity of Gαi1 (Fig.5 c). To test whether binding of 14-3-3 interferes with the GTPase accelerating activity of RGS7, we measured the GAP activity of RGS7 in single-turnover GTP hydrolysis assays (22Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis follows a single exponential time course equivalent to a first-order reaction which can be expressed by means of the rate constant of a first-order reaction (27Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Addition of 14-3-3 reduced the hydrolysis rate constant of phosphorylated RGS7 from 10- to 3.5-fold (Fig. 5 a), while addition of 14-3-3 to unphosphorylated RGS7 or Gαi1 had no effect on the hydrolysis rate constant (data not shown). In order to more quantitatively assess the effect of phosphorylation and/or 14-3-3 interaction on GAP activity of RGS7 hydrolysis, rate constants of several experiments were averaged and expressed as fold increase of basal hydrolysis rate (Table I). Addition of 14-3-3 to phosphorylated RGS7 almost completely abrogated the GTPase stimulatory effect, suggesting that phosphorylation of serine 434 and the subsequent interaction with 14-3-3 dramatically interferes with binding of activated Gαi1. These findings suggest that a phosphorylation-dependent interaction between 14-3-3 and the RGS domain may regulate the GAP activity of RGS proteins; however, the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation in vivo has yet to be determined. RGS3 impairs MAP kinase activation by mammalian G protein-linked receptors in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells (28Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To illustrate the functional consequences of the interaction between 14-3-3 and RGS proteins, we co-transfected the Gαi-linked m2 cholinergic receptor with and without RGS3 and 14-3-3 into HEK cells expressing Rap1 and Rap1GAPII. Stimulation with carbachol (30 μm, 15 min) resulted in a strong dual phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 on threonine 202 and tyrosine 204 (Fig. 5 b). Dual phosphorylation of ERK1/2 within the T-E-Y motif leads to the activation of the kinase and represents a sensitive measure of ERK1/2 activity. RGS3 inhibited the carbachol-mediated MAP kinase phosphorylation. Co-expression of 14-3-3 rescued the Gαi-induced MAP kinase phosphorylation from this inhibitory effect of RGS3 (Fig. 5 b), but did not affect MAP kinase activation in the absence of RGS3 (data not shown). Equal protein loading was ensured by reprobing the blot against actin and by Amido Black staining. These data provide further evidence that binding of 14-3-3 counteracts the inhibitory effect of RGS proteins on G protein-initiated signaling.Table IPhosphorylation and interaction of RGS7 with 14–3-3 inhibits GAP activityIncrease in GTP hydrolysis rate-foldControl1RGS7 unphosphorylated11.5RGS7 phosphorylated9.4RGS7 phosphorylated + 14–3-32.2Hydrolysis rate constants were determined as described (27Wang J.

The average of the relative hydrolysis rate constants of these three experiments is shown in TableI. Alignment of the sequence bordering serine 434 in RGS7 with other RGS members reveals a putative 14-3-3 binding motif: (K/E)-(K/R)-D-pS-Y-P (Fig. 5 c) (19Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R.

Since the 14-3-3-binding site in RGS7 is conserved in other RGS members, we speculate that 14-3-3 binding may similarly regulate the GAP activity of other RGS proteins. It is unclear whether the reduction of RGS GAP activity depends upon a conformation change induced by 14-3-3 binding or on the physical impedance of the association of RGS and Gα. Our data suggest that phosphorylation-dependent interaction of RGS proteins with regulatory proteins such as 14-3-3 may rapidly and dynamically control RGS GAP activity without altering their expression.

The major G*-DNA glycosylase (OGG), namely, OGG1 in eukaryotes, or MutM inEscherichia coli, excises G* when paired in DNA with C, G, and T, but not A, presumably because removal of G* from a G*·A pair would be mutagenic. However, repair of G* will prevent mutation when it is incorporated in the nascent strand opposite A. This could be carried out by a second OGG, OGG2, identified in yeast and human cells. We have characterized a new OGG activity in E. coli and then identified it to be endonuclease VIII (Nei), discovered as a damaged pyrimidine-specific DNA glycosylase. Nei shares sequence homology and reaction mechanism with MutM and is similar to human OGG2 in being able to excise G* when paired with A (or G). Kinetic analysis of wild type Nei showed that it has significant activity for excising G* relative to dihydrouracil. The presence of OGG2 type enzyme in both E. coli and eukaryotes, which is at least as efficient in excising G* from a G*·A (or G) pair as from a G*·C pair, supports the possibility of G* repair in the nascent DNA strand. 8-Oxoguanine (G*), induced by reactive oxygen species, is mutagenic because it mispairs with A.

Furthermore, reactive oxygen species, which are formed both endogenously as by-products of respiration and during the inflammatory response, are the most pervasive cellular genotoxic agents (4Grisham M.B.

Reactive oxygen species-induced mutations have been implicated in the etiology of a wide variety of diseases including cancer and arthritis and in aging (6Kasai H. Nishimura S. Sies H.

In all organisms tested so far from Escherichia colito mammals, 8-oxoG in DNA is repaired primarily via the DNA base excision repair pathway, and repair is initiated by the action of 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG) (8Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 9Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Maidt L. Floyd R.A. Mitra S.

This DNA glycosylase/AP lyase excises the base lesion by breaking the glycosylic bond via formation of a covalent Schiff base with the amino group of Pro for theE. coli enzyme or the ε-NH2 group of an internal Lys for the eukaryotic enzymes. This results in cleavage of the DNA phosphodiester backbone because of β (or βδ for theE. coli enzyme) elimination (8Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem.

The transient covalent intermediate forms a stable product after its reduction by NaBH4 or NaCNBH3 and is called the “trapped complex” (8Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem.

The cleaved terminus upstream of the G* site contains a 3′-phospho-α, β-unsaturated aldehyde or 3′-phosphate resulting from the β or βδ reaction, respectively. Subsequent steps in repair involve removal of the 3′-blocking groups followed by DNA gap filling and ligation of the broken ends (12Mitra S. Hazra T.K. Roy R. Ikeda S. Biswas T. Lock J. Boldogh I. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 7: 305-312Google Scholar). The major OGG (OGG1) in yeast and mammals corresponds to the only one identified in E. coli, which was named MutM or formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (the product of themutM/fpg gene) in their substrate specificity. All of these enzymes were shown to excise G* from G*·C, G*·G, or G*·T pairs in duplex DNA but not from a G*·A pair. This observation, first made in E. coli, led to the postulation of the “GO system” (13Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.-H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4690-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 14Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6321-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 15Grollman A.P. Moriya M. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 246-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In this model, G* formed directly or after incorporation in DNA opposite C is repaired by MutM. However, unrepaired G* could pair with A during DNA replication. In such an event, MutY, a G* (G)·A-specific adenine-DNA glycosylase (8Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 14Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6321-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), removes the A residue and thus provides a second chance for restoring the original DNA sequence by removing G* in a subsequent step when a G*·C pair is formed after repair. It is obvious that mutation will result if G* from a G*·A pair is removed by MutM (14Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6321-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 15Grollman A.P. Moriya M. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 246-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). However, mutagenesis due to 8-oxoguanine is rather complex, because 8-oxoG is not only generated in DNA in situ but may also be incorporated into DNA from reactive oxygen species-induced 8-oxo-dGTP in the nucleotide pool (2Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). MutT, ubiquitous 8-oxo-dGTPase, prevents incorporation of 8-oxoG by degrading the triphosphate (2Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The fact that the spontaneous mutation frequency of the mutT E. coliis much higher than that of the mutM mutant (2Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) indicates that a significant potential for mutation because of 8-oxoG incorporation opposite A exists during DNA replication. Furthermore, removal of A by MutY in such a situation where 8-oxoG is incorporated in the nascent strand opposite A will fix rather than prevent mutation. This paradox suggests the need for differential removal of 8-oxoG when incorporated into DNA versus being generated in situ (9Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Maidt L. Floyd R.A. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5116-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A similar rationale for nascent strand-specific repair of incorporated bases was proposed earlier by Krokan et al. (8Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). A second OGG (OGG2), first discovered in yeast (16Bruner S.D. Nash H.M. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently in human cells (9Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Maidt L. Floyd R.A. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5116-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), was found to remove G* from a G*·A pair. This observation led us to propose that this enzyme, as well as MYH (eukaryotic homolog of MutY), act primarily on the G*·A pair in the nascent DNA strand in mammalian cells. Thus G* will be removed from DNA only by OGG2, when it is incorporated in the nascent strand from 8-oxodGTP during DNA replication (9Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Maidt L. Floyd R.A. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5116-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To test whether a similar possibility exists in the bacteria, we checked for the presence of a G*·A-specific DNA glycosylase inE. coli. Here we report the presence of such an OGG2 type enzyme in E. coli, which we then showed to be identical to endonuclease VIII (Nei). E. coliBH20(mutM:: kan r) and BW35 (nei:: Cm r) were generously provided by Drs. K. Tano and S. S. Wallace, respectively. E. coli DE884(mutM::kan r nei::Cm r) was constructed by P1 transduction using BH20 and BW35 as recipient and donor strains for thenei: Cm r allele, respectively. The T7 RNA polymerase gene was introduced in DE884 by using the lysogenization kit (Novagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol (17Izumi T. Malecki J. Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. Hill J.H. Lee J.C. Mitra S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All of the studies described here except in Fig. 6 involved a 31-mer oligonucleotide (Fig. 1,Seq. A) containing a single G* at position 16, which was characterized by mass spectroscopic analysis and purchased from Midland Certified Corp. (Midland, TX). Some subsequent studies were also carried out with a 43-mer (Operon Technologies) and another 31-mer G*-containing oligonucleotide (Midland Certified Corp.) of a different sequence as shown in Fig. 1. Oligos complementary to the G*-containing oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Recombinant DNA Laboratory at UTMB, and all oligos were gel-purified before use. Because only the βδ elimination product and no free AP site was detected during Nei reaction, as shown under “Results,” the DNA glycosylase activity of Nei was routinely measured by the strand incision assay. This assay was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 20 fmol of 32P-labeled 31-mer duplex oligo, crude extract (10 μg) or purified enzyme (amount as described in the figure legends) in a buffer containing 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl as described earlier (9Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Maidt L. Floyd R.A. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5116-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). After termination of the reaction by extraction of the mixture with phenol/chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation, the 15-mer cleaved product was separated by electrophoresis in a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, 90 mmTris-Borate (pH 8.3), and 2 mm EDTA. The radioactivity in the gels was quantitated by analysis in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). E. coli BH20 was grown in a 20L fermentor. Log-phase cells (150–200 g) were suspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then lysed in a French Press. The crude lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 120,000 ×g for 45 min, and the nucleic acids in the supernatant were removed by centrifugation after the addition of Polymin P to 1%. After fractional precipitation of the supernatant with 35–55% saturation of ammonium sulfate, the precipitate was dissolved and dialyzed in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol) containing 50 mm NaCl. The dialyzate was clarified by centrifugation and chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose with a 50–500 mm NaCl gradient in buffer A. The active fractions were pooled, diluted to 50 mm NaCl in buffer A, and applied to a 25-ml column of High Performance SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After elution with a 50–500 mm NaCl gradient, active fractions were pooled and concentrated by Amicon filtration and then loaded onto a 100-ml column of Superdex-75 equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mmNaCl. Active fractions were then pooled, concentrated by Amicon filtration, and then used for biochemical studies. The trapping reaction was carried out at room temperature for 4 h in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCNBH3, and 25 nmol of G*·G oligo substrate. A small amount (100 fmol) of 5′-32P-labeled G*·G oligo was included as a tracer. The 3′ terminus of the complementary strand in the duplex oligo was biotinylated (Midland Certified Corp.). After completion of the reaction, the substrate DNA was separated with streptavidin-containing magnetic beads (Dynal, Inc.), which were washed several times with TE (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 1 m NaCl and then with TE containing 1% SDS and 200 mm NaCl to remove nonspecific proteins. Finally the beads were boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample-loading buffer, and the trapped complex present in the supernatant was electrophoresed in 12% polyacrylamide/SDS gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for peptide sequencing. E. coli HB101 containing the neiexpression plasmid cloned into pET22b vector was a gift from Dr. Z. Hatahet (18Hatahet Z. Kow Y.W. Purmal A.A. Cunningham R.P. Wallace S.S. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18814-18820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid was extracted, and the wild type of thenei gene was confirmed by sequencing the coding region.E. coli DE884 (DE3) was transformed with the neiexpression plasmid and then grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of L broth containing 5 μm ZnCl2 and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. At A 550 of 0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 100 μm, and the culture was grown at 20 °C for 12 h. The cells were then pelleted by low speed centrifugation and sonicated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Nei was purified from sonicated extracts in a series of steps starting with the removal of nucleic acids with polymin P followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation to 60% saturation. The ammonium sulfate pellet was dialyzed in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) containing 100 mm NaCl. The dialysate was then applied to a 5-ml Hitrap-SP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After extensive washing with buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl, Nei was eluted with 100 ml of 0.1–0.5m NaCl gradient. The protein was eluted at 0.25–0.3m NaCl. Active fractions were then pooled and concentrated by Amicon-10 and then onto a 120-ml Superdex-75 equilibrated with buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. Active fractions were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80 °C for future studies. One nm Nei was incubated at 37 °C with 8-oxoG (31-mer, 20–100 nm) or DHU (5–20 nm) containing duplex oligonucleotide substrate for 10 and 5 min, respectively. We confirmed that the enzyme maintains linear kinetics for at least up to 20 min. The reaction buffer (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 25–30 fmol of 32P-labeled substrate. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of formamide/dye containing 10 mm NaOH and was resolved on a 20% polyacrylamide-urea gel. The radioactivity in the bands of the gel was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by using data analysis/graphics application program of KaleidaGraph. One hundred pmol of 8-oxoG-containing substrate DNA was incubated with 30–35 pmol of Nei or MutM for 4 h at 37 °C. The reaction buffer contained 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 100 mm KCl, and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin in a 100-μl reaction volume. As control, DNA substrates were incubated with inactivated enzyme or without the enzyme, and all the reactions were performed in duplicate. Inactivation of the enzyme was achieved by heating at 100 °C for 15 min, and the DNA samples were precipitated with 270 μl of ethanol. DNA pellets and supernatant fractions were separated. Supernatant fractions were freed from ethanol under vacuum in a SpeedVac and subsequently lyophilized for 18 h. Lyophilized fractions were derivatized and then analyzed by gas chromatography/isotope-dilution mass spectrometry with selected-ion monitoring (IDMS-SIM) as described (19Karakaya A. Jaruga P. Bohr W.A. Grollman A.P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar,20Doetsch P.W. Zastawny T.H. Martin A.M. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The discovery of a second OGG, OGG2, in yeast and human cells (9Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Maidt L. Floyd R.A. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5116-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Bruner S.D. Nash H.M. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) raised the possibility of the presence of a similar enzyme in bacteria including E. coli in which only one 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase, namely, MutM, was identified so far. Ten μg of crude extracts from wild type and mutM E. coli were incubated with 5′-labeled duplex oligos containing G* paired with G, C, and A, and the products were analyzed in a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The cleavage of G*·A oligo in the G* strand (Fig.2 A, lane 4) by extract of wild type E. coli suggested the presence of a second OGG in wild type E. coli, because MutM, the only known OGG, does not cleave this substrate (13Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.-H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4690-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). This possibility was further supported by the presence of OGG activity in the mutM E. coli extract (lanes 5–7); the oligos with G*·G and G*·A pairs were the preferred substrates for this enzyme (lanes 6 and 7). Because MutM does not remove G* from a G*·A pair (13Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.-H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4690-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), similar levels of activity were observed in extracts of the wild type and mutM E. coli for the oligo with the G*·A pair (lanes 4 and 7). We confirmed that the strand incision activity in E. coli extract was specific for the G*-containing strand because a control oligo, identical to the G* oligo except for substitution of G* with G, was not cleaved by the extract. At the same time, no cleavage of the complementary strand was observed when the strand containing the 32P label was used as the substrate (data not shown). Furthermore, the lack of detectable cleavage of the labeled G* strand in the G*·C duplex oligo by an excess human AP endonuclease or E. coli endonuclease IV indicated the lack of contamination of the G* oligo with an AP site (data not shown). We then examined the nature of the 3′ terminus of the cleaved product using a partially purified protein from mutM E. coli. Fig.2 B shows that the upstream fragment contained 3′-phosphate (lane 3), which was identical to the βδ-elimination product of MutM reaction with the same substrate (lane 2; 21). These results indicate that the second G*-removing enzyme inE. coli, like MutM, is an 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/AP lyase and carries out βδ elimination. We extensively purified 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase activity from mutM E. coli extract by assaying the cleaved product or the trapped complex. The ability of OGG to form a trapped complex with 32P-labeled substrate DNA helped us to identify the specific enzyme band. The trapped complex was purified by binding to streptavidin-containing beads, and the eluted proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Coomassie Blue staining of the membrane showed the presence of four to five major bands (Fig. 3 A), only one of which was radiolabeled (Fig. 3 B). Our initial attempt to determine the N-terminal peptide sequence failed suggesting that the N terminus of the intact protein may be blocked. We then digested the eluted radioactive band with endo Lys C, and the peptides were separated by capillary high pressure liquid chromatography for sequencing. The sequence analysis of two purified peptides were GKPLTDV and TTLSSRPF. These sequences are identical to the sequences of Nei from amino acid residues 20–26 and 248–255, respectively. We then purified Nei from mutM nei E. coli harboring the expression plasmid for Nei to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 4) and tested the enzyme for 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase activity. Nei had OGG activity, although, the DHU·A repair activity is significantly higher than G* repair (Fig. 5). Of the three G* base pairs, the G*·G pair was the preferred substrate for Nei. Nei, unlike MutM, could remove G* from the G*·A pair as well (Fig. 5,lane 3). In view of the possibility that the Nei activity on G*·A pair may be affected by the sequence context of the 8-oxoG in the substrate oligos used, we tested G*·A specific DNA glycosylase/AP lyase activity of several duplex oligos of different sequences and size. Fig.6 shows that with the same concentration of substrate and enzyme as used in the experiment described in Fig. 5, there was a significant difference in the amount of the cleavage product. In fact, the best substrate was the 43-mer oligo, which was not routinely used in this study. We also observed robust OGG activity with a 54-mer 8-oxoG duplex oligo of an entirely different sequence (data not shown). To confirm that Nei is indeed an 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase that releases 8-oxoG, we tested for the free base in the reaction mixture. After incubation of Nei with G*·G-containing oligonucleotide, purified Nei released a product that had the same retention time as the authentic G* as analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Forty-five pmol of G* was released from 100 pmol of substrate by 33 pmol of Nei (TableI), whereas in a duplicate, independent reaction about 50 pmol of strand incision product was generated (data not shown). In this experiment, MutM was used as a positive control, which is also active toward the G*·G-containing substrate. Furthermore, we made similar observations about the release of 8-oxoG from G*·A and G*·C-containing substrates (data not shown). We examined whether Nei excised 8-oxoG without further cleavage of the resulting AP site. However, lack of additional strand incision of the G*·G substrate oligo with E. coli endonuclease IV, an AP endonuclease, after Nei treatment indicated a concerted action of Nei in base release and βδ elimination (data not shown). Details are provided under “Experimental Procedures.” Kinetic properties of Nei using DHU·A and G*·N substrates were compared (TableII). This protein released DHU and G* in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The active enzyme concentration was determined to be 60%, as described previously (22Ikeda S. Biswas T. Roy R. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Kurosky A. Sarker A.H. Seki S. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).K m and k cat determination were carried out in the linear range of enzyme activity. All substrate oligo duplexes have identical sequence except for the DHU or G* residue at position 16. Other details are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The K m for the G*-substrates was almost 4–5-fold higher than for the DHU substrate. Furthermore, Nei was catalytically more efficient in releasing DHU than G* from substrates with identical sequence context. Our discovery of a second 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase activity in human cell extracts, which is antigenically distinct from the cloned OGG1, and which, unlike OGG1, preferentially excises 8-oxoguanine from DNA when paired with G and A, led us to propose a distinct role of this new enzyme, named OGG2, in excising G* from the nascent strand (9Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Maidt L. Floyd R.A. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5116-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recent studies showing that mouse cells lacking OGG1 are competent in slow but significant removal of 8-oxoG from DNA particularly in proliferating cells support the presence of a second OGG in mammalian cells (23Klungland A. Rosewell I. Hollenbach S. Larsen E. Daly G. Epe B. Seeberg E. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13300-13305Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 24Minowa O.

A. 2000; 11: 4156-4161Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This was further supported by the observation that transcription coupled repair of 8-oxoG was not significantly affected by inactivation of OGG1 2P. K. Cooper, personal communication. and is presumably carried out by the second OGG in mouse cells. A similar OGG2 activity was discovered earlier in yeast (16Bruner S.D. Nash H.M. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25de Oliveira R. van der Kemp P.A. Thomas D. Geiger A. Nehls P. Boiteus S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To establish that the dual mode of 8-oxoG repair exists in all organisms, we needed to show that an OGG2 type enzyme, which is distinct from MutM/formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase, also exists in bacteria such as E. coli. The apparent lack of earlier efforts to examine the presence of other G*-specific DNA glycosylase in mutM E. coli is surprising. In any event, we tested extracts of mutM E. coli and easily identified significant activity of an uncharacterized G*-specific DNA glycosylase/AP lyase. Because an AP lyase forms a trapped complex with the substrate in the presence of NaCNBH3, we purified the biotinylated trapped complex coupled to streptavidin-magnetic beads and then sequenced an internal peptide. De novo identification of this activity as Nei provided the initial evidence for the intrinsic OGG activity of this enzyme. Measurement of release of 8-oxoG in the reaction product of purified Nei confirmed its identity as an 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase. More importantly, when the G*·A containing substrate was used, the OGG activity was mostly contributed by Nei because MutM is inactive with this substrate (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 7). To provide genetic evidence for the Ogg activity of Nei, thenei gene was inactivated in mutM E. coli. It is interesting that a small amount of OGG type activity persisted even in the mutM nei E. coli (Fig. 7,lanes 5–7). The specific activity of the mutM E. coli extract was about 1 pmol of substrate (G*·G-containing oligo) cleavage/mg of protein/min at 37 °C compared with 0.25 pmol of substrate cleavage/mg of protein/min of the mutM nei E. coli extract. Thus Nei contributed about 70% of the OGG2 type activity. We were unsuccessful in purifying and thereby identifying this second, minor enzyme. Nei was identified earlier as the second DNA glycosylase, after Nth, specific for oxidized pyrimidines, e.g. thymine glycol and 5-hydroxycytosine, and also DHU (26Jiang D. Hatahet Z. Blaisdell J.O. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3773-3782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Saito Y. Uraki F. Nakajima S. Asaeda A. Ono K. Kubo K. Yamamoto K. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32230-32239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The substrate preferences of Nei and Nth are overlapping but not identical (26Jiang D. Hatahet Z. Blaisdell J.O. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3773-3782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite similar substrate preference, Nth and Nei have no sequence homology, nor similar functional motifs (26Jiang D. Hatahet Z. Blaisdell J.O. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3773-3782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Saito Y. Uraki F. Nakajima S. Asaeda A. Ono K. Kubo K. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3783-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For example, Nth is the prototype of the class of DNA glycosylase whose substrate binding is mediated by “helix-hairpin-helix” motif and which contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster also needed for DNA binding (29Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 30Augeri L. Lee Y.M. Barton A.B. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nei, on the other hand, has extensive sequence homology with MutM. The N-terminal Pro of MutM was identified to be the active site nucleophile of this enzyme (31Zharkov D.O. Rieger R.A. Iden C.R. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5335-5341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because the N-terminal Pro and five of the first six residues are identical in Nei and MutM, it is expected that the N-terminal Pro is also the active site nucleophile in Nei, which is covalently linked to the deoxyribose in the trapped complex (26Jiang D. Hatahet Z. Blaisdell J.O. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3773-3782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that we could not determine the N-terminal peptide sequence of the Nei trapped complex, as was the case for MutM (31Zharkov D.O. Rieger R.A. Iden C.R. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5335-5341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), supports this possibility. Furthermore, Nei behaves like MutM in carrying out βδ elimination and generating a 3′-phosphate terminus in the cleaved DNA oligo after excision of 8-oxoguanine. Nth, on the other hand, generates β elimination products (22Ikeda S. Biswas T. Roy R. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Kurosky A. Sarker A.H. Seki S. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Based on the similarities between MutM and Nei, it was not completely surprising that Nei possesses 8-oxoG excision activity. Conversely, several recent studies have shown that MutM could also excise oxidized pyrimidines such as uracil glycol, 5-hydroxycytosine, or 5-hydroxyuracil (18Hatahet Z. Kow Y.W. Purmal A.A. Cunningham R.P. Wallace S.S. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18814-18820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Purmal A.A. Lampman G.W. Bond J.P. Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10026-10035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus MutM and Nei may have a significant overlap in their substrate specificity. What is surprising, however, is the preference of Nei for G* when paired with purines and its relatively weak activity with the G*·C pair, the preferred substrate of MutM and eukaryotic OGG1 (9Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Maidt L. Floyd R.A. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5116-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 33Radicella J.P. Dherin C. Desmaze C. Fox M.S. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Sci. U.

A. 1997; 94: 8016-8020Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). While our manuscript was in preparation, Blaisdell et al. (36Blaisdell J.O. Hatahet J. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6396-6402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) published a paper in which they showed that Nei had weak OGG activity with a G*·C-containing duplex oligo, but no significant activity was observed with the G*·A pair-containing substrate. We are unable to explain the discrepancy between their results and ours. It is possible that the sequence context of the oligo substrate used in their study inhibited 8-oxoG excision by Nei. In fact, we have shown (Fig. 6) that the specific OGG activity of Nei varied 4–5-fold with the sequence context of the G*·A pair in the oligos we tested. In any case, we decided to eliminate a remote possibility that the nei gene was mutated somehow in our E. coli strain, which caused its altered substrate specificity. So we cloned the nei gene including its own promoter from mutM E. coli by PCR and confirmed the presence of wild type sequence in the clone by matching with the E. coli GenBankTM data base and then confirmed G*·A-specific G* excision activity of the expressed protein (data not shown). Using 31-mer oligonucleotide duplexes of identical sequence (Seq A) except for the presence of DHU or G* at position 16, we compared the kinetic parameters of Nei for various G* pairs and a DHU·A pair. It is evident that DHU was a better substrate for Nei than 8-oxoG, in regard to substrate affinity as judged by the K m values (Table II). However, the enzyme turnover for G* excision activity from a G*·A or G*·G pair was only 5–7-fold less than for DHU excision activity and thus should be physiologically significant. More importantly, the order of substrate preference for G*·G>G*·A>G*·C as observed with E. coli extract was the same as with the pure Nei protein. Recently two distinct OGGs from the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans have been characterized, one of which was active toward thymine glycol and appears to be a homolog of Nei (37Bauche C. Laval J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 262-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is somewhat puzzling that both human OGG2 and E. coli Nei prefer the G*·G pair to G*·A and other G* base pairs. However, it was shown earlier that G* can pair with G as a 6-enolate-8-keto tautomer (38Culp S.J. Cho B.P. Kadlubar F.F. Evans F.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MutY was shown to excise not only A but also G when paired with 8-oxoG (39Zhang Q.-M. Ishikawa N. Nakahara T. Yonei S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4669-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the G*·G pair could occur in vivo and is subject to repair by OGG2 or Nei. It is interesting to note in this context that yeast OGG2 was found to be identical to Ntg1, an oxidized pyrimidine-specific DNA glycosylase, which is similar to the Ntg2, the other glycosylase with a similar substrate range (16Bruner S.D. Nash H.M. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Doetsch P.W. Zastawny T.H. Martin A.M. Dizdaroglu M.

Whereas both Ntgs belong to the Nth family in regard to structural motifs, only Ntg1 has OGG2 type activity. This activity, as was found to be the case for Nei, appears to be weaker than its oxidized pyrimidine-specific DNA glycosylase activity. Taken together, our results support the prediction that OGG2 type activity, which excises G* from a G*·A pair, is ubiquitous and that it may have an important role in 8-oxoG repair in proliferating cells and in transcriptionally active genes.

American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1996: 687-694Google Scholar). The first step produces 4′-phosphopantothenic acid by phosphorylation of pantothenic acid. The subsequent formation of 4′-phosphopantetheine is a two-step process in which 4′-phosphopantothenate and cysteine are converted to 4′-phosphopantothenoyl-cysteine by formation of a peptide linkage followed by decarboxylation of the cysteine. In the final two steps, 4′-phosphopantetheine is adenylated to form dephospho-CoA, which in turn is phosphorylated at the 3′ position of ribose to form CoA. The first step of CoA biosynthesis catalyzed by pantothenate kinase (PanK)1 is a key regulatory point in CoA biosynthesis (3Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J.

Escherichia coli PanK (bPanK) is a homodimer of 36-kDa subunits, and the amino acid sequence contains an A-type ATP-binding consensus sequence, GXXXXGKS (10Song W.J. Jackowski S. J.

PanK activity is inhibited by nonesterified CoA and to a lesser extent by its thioesters, which competitively interfere with ATP binding (4Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

ADrosophila PanK has been identified as encoded by thefumble gene and may play a role in cell division (GenBankTM accession number AF221546). Comparison of the protein sequences predicted from these cDNAs with the bPanK amino acid sequence points out strong dissimilarity between prokaryotic and eukaryotic PanKs, although significant homology is found among the PanK sequences within each class (12Calder R.B.

This observation suggests that targeting the bacterial enzyme would be an effective therapeutic strategy for development of new anti-infective agents. We investigated the molecular basis for bPanK catalysis and regulation by determining the structures of binary complexes of bPanK and AMPPNP, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, and CoA. The CoaA gene encoding bPanK (10Song W.J. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6411-6417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into pET21a (Novagen, Inc.) and transformed intoE. coli B834(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, Inc.). The E. coli cells harboring the pET21-bPanK plasmid were grown in 4 liters of M9 minimal medium (6 g/liter Na2HPO4, 3 g/liter KH2 PO4, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, and 1 g/liter NH4 Cl) containing 0.4% glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.0005% thiamine, amino acid mixture (0.5 g/liter of each amino acid), 50 μg/ml of ampicillin, 34 μg/ml of chloramphenicol, and 0.1 g/liter of methionine at 37 °C. When the culture reached an absorbance of 0.7–0.8 at 600 nm, the cells were harvested and washed with the M9 minimal medium twice. The cells were resuspended in the M9 minimal medium containing 40 mg/l of seleno-l -methionine (Sigma). After induction with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cells were allowed to grow for another 3 h to be harvested. The harvested cell pellet was resuspended in 400 ml of disruption buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride) and lysed with sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was purified by Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography in which bPanK was eluted with an increasing NaCl gradient. Eluted factions containing bPanK were pooled and concentrated. The concentrated sample was then purified with a S-200 Superdex gel filtration column for the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The elution buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, and the flow rate was 60 ml/h. Fractions containing bPanK were pooled and dialyzed at 4 °C for 15 h against dialysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmEDTA). The dialyzed sample was concentrated to 20 mg/ml for crystallization trials. Co-crystals of selenomethionine bPanK and AMPPNP were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Before crystallization, AMPPNP was added to the protein to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The hanging drops containing the equal volume of the protein and the reservoir solution were equilibrated at 4 °C against the reservoir solution (11% polyethylene glycol 8,000 and 0.1m HEPES, pH 7.5). The trigonal crystals appeared after several days, which grew further for about 1 more week. These crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 40% glycerol, 15% polyethylene glycol 8,000, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm AMPPNP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1m HEPES at pH 7.5 for cryo-data collection. Crystals of bPanK in complex with CoA were grown at room temperature by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. To achieve the full occupancy of bound CoA, bPanK was mixed with CoA at the final concentration of 2 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 24 h at 4 °C. Equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir solution were combined. The reservoir solution consisted of 10% polyethylene glycol 4,000, 50 mm Li2SO4, 2% isopropanol, and 0.1m N-[2-acetamido]-2-iminodiacetic acid at pH 6.5. Rod-like crystals appeared after 1 week and grew for another 2–3 weeks. These crystals were frozen using a cryoprotectant solution containing 40% glycerol, 12% polyethylene glycol 4,000, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CoA, 2 mmMgCl2, 50 mm Li2SO4, and 0.1 m N-[2-acetamido]-2-iminodiacetic acid at pH 6.5 for cryo-data collection. Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data were measured from a single crystal of the AMPPNP-bound bPanK at beamline X12C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, equipped with a Q4 CCD detector (Brandeis) operating at 100 K. Three wavelengths near the selenium absorption edge, 0.95 Å (the remote), 0.9791 Å (the peak), and 0.9794 Å (the inflection point), were chosen by measuring the x-ray absorption spectrum of the protein crystal. The data set from each wavelength was integrated, reduced, and scaled by the programs DENZO and SCAPEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276A: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38565) Google Scholar). The crystals of the AMPPNP-bound enzyme belong to space group P3221 with unit cell dimensions ofa = 130.1 Å and c = 281.8 Å. The program SOLVE (15Terwilliger T. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was used to scale three wavelength data sets together, to locate selenium positions and to calculate the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phases. The statistics of data collection and phasing are summarized in TableI. The initial electron density map calculated at 3.0 Å resolution was improved by the noncrystallographic symmetry averaging method using the program DM (the CCP4 suite) (16Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19762) Google Scholar). The atomic model was built using the graphics programs O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M.

Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The refinement steps included rigid body, simulated annealing, conjugate gradient minimization, and individual B-factor refinement. A solvent mask was calculated with the bulk solvent correction routine in XPLOR (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR , , version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). During refinement, NCS restraints were imposed on the main chain atoms. The final structure contains four subunits of bPanK (6–316 residues in one subunit and 8–316 residues in the other three subunits).

Open table in a new tab Complete diffraction data from a single crystal of the CoA-bound bPanK were also measured at beamline X12C at the National Synchrotron Light Source. The programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276A: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38565) Google Scholar) were used to integrate and scale the data set. The crystals of the CoA-bound enzyme belong to space group P1 with unit cell dimensions ofa = 62.0 Å, b = 71.2 Å,c = 87.7 Å, α = 102.4°, β = 89.5°, and γ = 93.2°. The data collection statistics are summarized in Table I. The structure of the CoA-bound bPanK was determined by the molecular replacement method using one subunit of the AMPPNP-bound enzyme as a search model. The cross-rotation and translation functions and Patterson correlation refinement were calculated using the program XPLOR (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR , , version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Using the data between 15.0 and 4.0 Å, the rotation function, followed by Patterson correlation refinement, gave four outstanding solutions that correspond to four subunits of bPanK. Because any point can be taken as an origin in space group P1, rotation of the initial search model according to one of the four rotation function solutions determined the orientation and position of the first subunit. With fixing this orientation and position of the first subunit, the orientations of the other three subunits were determined by applying the corresponding noncrystallographic symmetry operations to the first subunit. The positions of the other three subunits were then determined by finding the relative x, y, andz translations of each of the three subunits with respect to the first subunit. The model including all four subunits was subjected to rigid body refinement at a resolution between 6. 0 and 4. 0 Å in the program XPLOR (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR , , version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The high resolution limit, which restricted the maximum shift of structure in the refinement, was set to 4. 0 Å resolution to provide a possible large shift of the structure up to 4.0 Å. The low resolution limit was set to 6.0 Å resolution below which the intensities of reflections were severely affected by the diffraction of solvent molecules in the crystal. The Rfactor at this stage was high (51.0%), suggesting that the conformation of the CoA-bound structure was different from that of the search model, the AMPPNP-bound structure. To consider the solvent contribution to the intensities of reflections at low resolution, the structure factor amplitudes of solvent molecules in the crystal were calculated using the bulk solvent correction routine in XPLOR (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR , , version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), and thus the low resolution limit could be extended to 50.0 Å resolution. Crystallographic refinement including simulated annealing, conjugate gradient minimization, and individual B-factor refinement was then performed at the resolution between 50.0 and 2.5 Å. After the first round of refinement, the quality of the structure was dramatically improved with a working R factor of 27.4% and a freeR factor of 30.1%. The F o −F c difference map showed continuous density for CoA, verifying the correct molecular replacement solution. Several iterations of model building in the program O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar) and the refinement in the program XPLOR (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR , , version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) further dropped both R factors. The final refinement statistics are shown in Table II. Because of the slight difference between four subunits, noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied to only 89% of total residues of each subunit. In the final model, residues 1–5 in subunit 1; residues 1–7 and 211–212 in subunit 2; residues 1–5 and 210–213 in subunit 3; and residues 1–7, 83–85, and 212–214 in subunit 4 are excluded because they are disordered in the crystal. In the structures of the AMPPNP-bound and the CoA-bound bPanKs, four identical subunits are found in an asymmetric unit. When the four subunits occupying an asymmetric unit of each structure are compared, the average RMSD of Cα atoms for the AMPPNP-bound and the CoA-bound enzymes are 0.46 and 0.34 Å, respectively. These values are consistent with estimated errors in their atomic coordinates. A subunit of bPanK adopts a mononucleotide-binding fold (20Schulz G.E. Curr. Biol. 1992; 2: 61-67Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar): a seven-stranded β-sheet (strands, 2, 3, and 8–11) is flanked by α-helices (D and E on one side and G and J on the other side) (Fig.1). An intervening loop between strand 2 and helix E, known as the P-loop, contains most of the residues that interact with phosphate oxygens of the AMPPNP. There are four small antiparallel β-strands (strands 4–7) that are not part of the main β-sheet (Fig. 1 a). Residues from helices H and I including their intervening loop are involved in binding CoA (Fig.1 a). The N-terminal region including strand 1, helices A and D, and a loop between helices A and B forms the major part of the dimer interface (Fig. 1 a). The Dali server (21Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) was used to search for known proteins structurally similar to bPanK. Applied to one subunit of bPanK, the best matches occurred with proteins containing a mononucleotide binding fold,i.e. phosphoribulokinase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Protein Data Bank code 1a7j, RMSD 1.9 Å, 185 residues), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase from rat (Protein Data Bank code 1bif, RMSD 1.7 Å, 96 residues), and adenylate kinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Protein Data Bank code 1zin, RMSD 2.1 Å, 110 residues). In light of the wide distribution of the mononucleotide binding fold, these findings are not surprising. However, the remarkable similarity of bPanK to R. sphaeroides phosphoribulokinase is unexpected because their sequence homology is limited to the P loop. Phosphoribulokinase catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of ribulose 5-phosphate to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate in the Calvin cycle (22Wolosiuk R.A. Ballicora M.A. Hagelin K. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 622-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Four subunits found in an asymmetric unit of the AMPPNP-bound enzyme are assembled to form two dimers, consistent with the fact that bPanK functions as a dimer in solution (11Song W.J. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27051-27058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dimerization interface occurs between two long α-helices from each of the subunits that form an extensive antiparallel coiled coil (Fig.2 a). The interface contact including this coiled coil buries 4118 Å2 of accessible surface area of each subunit. The physical makeup of the interface contact is slightly hydrophobic: 57% of nonpolar and 43% of polar/charged residues. By comparison, the dimer-dimer interface is not extensive. About 1790 Å2 of the accessible surface area of each dimer is buried. Most of the residues involved in this contact are predominantly hydrophilic: 27% nonpolar and 73% polar/charged residues. There are also two dimers in the asymmetric unit of the CoA-bound bPanK. However, the dimerization interface of the CoA-bound enzyme is not identical to that of the AMPPNP-bound enzyme resulting in a conformational change. The dimerization interface, depicted parallel to helix D of both subunits, shows a helical break where a couple of turns of helix D of one subunit, involving residues 68–73, are unwound (Fig. 2 b). This helical break is observed in both dimers. Consequently, the last two turns of helix D of the first subunit are shifted closer to helix D of the second subunit. This shift disturbs the dimerization interface to bring about an 18° rotation of the second subunit with respect to the first subunit, resulting in movement of the second subunit of as much as 15 Å (Fig.2 c). The altered interface contact buries 3004 Å2 of accessible surface area of each subunit. The two dimers also interact by burying of 2174 Å2 of each dimer surface. The electron density of AMPPNP is clearly defined in both dimers occupying an asymmetric unit of the AMPPNP-bound bPanK (Fig. 3 a). AMPPNP is bound in a groove formed by residues from the P-loop, the connecting loop of helices B and C, and the connecting loop of strands 10 and 11. AMPPNP with residues lining the binding site are shown in Fig.3 b. The adenine base is sandwiched by the side chains of Asn43 and His307, the latter side chain further interacting with the side chain of Trp239. The N6 nitrogen of the adenine base interacts via water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of Tyr55 and Thr104 and the amino group of Lys303, whereas its N1 nitrogen forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the amide nitrogen of Ser47. The ribose is hydrogen-bonded to the carboxyl group of Asp45. The α-phosphate interacts with the hydroxyl group and the amide nitrogen of Thr103. The β- and γ-phosphates interact with the amino group of Lys101 and the β-phosphate interacts with the amide nitrogens of Gly100, Lys101, and Ser102, whereas the γ-phosphate interacts with the amide nitrogen of Ala98 and the guanidinium group of Arg243. A magnesium ion is coordinated by β- and γ-phosphates on one side and the carboxyl group of Glu199 and the hydroxyl group of Ser102 on the other side. The well defined electron density for CoA is seen in both dimers occupying the asymmetric unit of the CoA-bound bPanK (Fig. 4 a). CoA is bound in the enzyme in a bent conformation in a deep pocket lined by residues from helix H, the P loop, the connecting loop of strands 5 and 6 and the connecting loop of helices H and I (Fig. 4 b). Because CoA is a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP and these two ligands share the ADP moiety, it was suggested that both ligands bind to the same site (4Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Song W.J. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27051-27058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the adenine base of CoA is inserted between the side chains of His177 and Phe247, whereas the adenine-interacting residues in the AMPPNP-bound enzyme are Asn43 and His307 (Fig.4 b). The α-phosphate of CoA is salt bridged to the guanidinium group of Arg243 and the amino group of Lys101 that also interacts with the β-phosphate of CoA (Fig. 4 b). The 3′-phosphate of CoA is hydrogen-bonded to the amide nitrogen of Ile42 and the hydroxyl group of Ser102 and salt bridged to the guanidinium group of Arg106 (Fig. 4 b). These interactions of the 3′-phosphate group may be essential for the inhibitory effect of CoA because dephospho-CoA is a significantly less potent inhibitor of bPanK activity (4Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By comparison, the same 3′-phosphate group in several CoA-binding proteins shows no interaction with the protein and is exposed to solvent (for review see Ref. 23Engel C. Wierenga R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The exceptions are acyl-CoA binding protein (24Kragelund B.B. Andersen K.V. Madsen J.C. Knudsen J. Poulsen F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1260-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the surfactin synthetase activating enzyme Sfp (25Reuter K. Mofid M.R. Marahiel M.A. Ficner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6823-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), in which the 3′-phosphate interacts with the protein residues such as His and Lys. Hydrophobic atoms of the pantothenate moiety of CoA form van der Waals' contacts with residues Leu130, Tyr175, and Ile281 (Fig. 4 b). The carbonyl oxygen of the pantothenate moiety near the β-mercaptoethylamine moiety is hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl group of Tyr240 and to the amide group of Asn282 (Fig. 4 b). The amide nitrogen of the β-mercaptoethylamine moiety is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group of Tyr180 (Fig. 4 b). Strikingly, the thiol group of the β-mercaptoethylamine moiety is tightly sealed from water molecules by interacting with four aromatic residues, Phe244, Phe252, Phe259, and Tyr262 and also by intra-molecular hydrogen bonding to the amino group of the adenine base (Fig. 4 b). The thiol group approaches the face of Phe259 at the distance"
https://openalex.org/W1533007641,"The β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) shows the resistance to agonist-induced internalization. As β-arrestin is important for internalization, we examine the interaction of β-arrestin with β1AR with three different methods: intracellular trafficking of β-arrestin, binding of in vitro translated β-arrestin to intracellular domains of β1- and β2ARs, and inhibition of βAR-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities by β-arrestin. The green fluorescent protein-tagged β-arrestin 2 translocates to and stays at the plasma membrane by β2AR stimulation. Although green fluorescent protein-tagged β-arrestin 2 also translocates to the plasma membrane, it returns to the cytoplasm 10–30 min after β1AR stimulation. The binding of in vitro translated β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 to the third intracellular loop and the carboxyl tail of β1AR is lower than that of β2AR. The fusion protein of β-arrestin 1 with glutathione S-transferase inhibits the β1- and β2AR-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities, although inhibition of the β1AR-stimulated activity requires a higher concentration of the fusion protein than that of the β2AR-stimulated activity. These results suggest that weak interaction of β1AR with β-arrestins explains the resistance to agonist-induced internalization. This is further supported by the finding that β-arrestin can induce internalization of β1AR when β-arrestin 1 does not dissociate from β1AR by fusing to the carboxyl tail of β1AR. The β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) shows the resistance to agonist-induced internalization.

Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Within seconds or minutes upon agonist stimulation, β2AR is phosphorylated by GRKs and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Subsequently, β-arrestin binds to the GRK-phosphorylated β2AR and inhibits coupling of β2AR with Gs. β2AR is also internalized (sequestered) from the plasma membrane to the intracellular endosome through clathrin-coated pits in a similar period of time to that of uncoupling. β-Arrestin plays a central role not only in uncoupling but also in the internalization of β2AR. The overexpression of β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 restored agonist-induced internalization of the internalization-defective mutant of β2AR (Y326F-β2AR), and the β-arrestin mutants (V53D-β-arrestin 1 and V54D-β-arrestin 2) inhibit internalization of β2AR (2Ferguson S.S.G.

After internalization, vesicular acidification leads to conformational changes of the phosphorylated β2AR and facilitates dephosphorylation by vesicle-associated phosphatase (4Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Then the dephosphorylated β2AR returns to the plasma membrane and responds to the new stimulus. In contrast to β2AR, much less is known about the mechanism of β1AR desensitization. Freedman et al. (5Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) reported that in transiently transfected HEK293 cells, the exposure to agonist for a short time leads to phosphorylation of β1AR by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and GRKs, and phosphorylation of β1AR decreases the responses to second isoproterenol stimulation. They also showed that overexpression of β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 enhances uncoupling of β1AR from Gs. These results indicate that β-arrestins are involved in the uncoupling of β1AR as well as β2AR. However, there is a significant difference in the rate of internalization between β1AR and β2AR. Upon agonist stimulation for a short time, β1AR undergoes only slight internalization, whereas β2AR internalizes rapidly in the same cellular environment (6Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T. Nantel F. Bonin H. Valiquette M. Frielle T. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar). Green and Liggett (7Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26215-26219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the transfer of the proline-rich region in the third intracellular loop of β1AR to the homologous site of β2AR attenuates internalization, and deletion of the same region from β1AR promotes internalization. They suggested that the differences in agonist-induced internalization between β1- and β2ARs are partially because of the proline-rich region in the third intracellular loop of β1AR. Thus, no study has been conducted to analyze the interaction of β1AR with β-arrestin explaining the resistance to agonist-induced internalization. We demonstrate in the present study that the weak interaction of β1AR with β-arrestins results in the resistance of β1AR to agonist-induced internalization. By analyzing chimeric receptors of β1- and β2ARs, we also demonstrate that the third intracellular loop and the carboxyl tail of these two receptors are major regions determining the difference in internalization behavior between β1- and β2ARs. DMEM and LipofectAMINE were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS).

J. Lefkowitz (Duke University). The plasmids encoding for human GRK5 and GRK6 were kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University). HEK293 cells were from TAKARA Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). Propranolol, (−)isoproterenol·hydrochloride, benzamidine, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were from Sigma. The plasmid pEGFP-N1 was from CLONTECH.l-[35S]methionine, HyperfilmTMMP, and glutathione-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Leupeptin was from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). [3H]CGP-12177 was from NEN Life Science Products. The 100-mm dishes, glass-bottomed 35-mm dishes, and collagen-coated 6-well plates were obtained from IWAKI GLASS (Chiba, Japan). TNT quick coupled transcription/translation system was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The constructs of the hemagglutinin-tagged β1- and β2ARs were described by Sato et al. (8Sato Y. Kurose H. Isogaya M. Nagao T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 315: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins of β1AR, β2AR, and β-arrestin 2 with EGFP molecule were constructed by a modification of method of Barak et al. (9Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 10Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). For construction of the β1- and β2AR fusion proteins with EGFP molecule, restriction sites (BamHI for β1AR and ApaI for β2AR) were introduced by PCR at the ends of the coding sequences of the respective βARs. Then, the entire coding regions of the receptors without stop codon were ligated into EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1 for β1AR or EcoRI and ApaI sites of pEGFP-N1 for β2AR. For the fusion protein of β-arrestin 2 with EGFP molecule, restriction sites (HindIII for amino-terminal and XbaI for carboxyl-terminal) were first introduced by PCR at each side of the coding sequence of β-arrestin 2. Then, the entire coding region of β-arrestin 2 was ligated intoHindIII and XbaI sites of pEGFP-N1. The resulting fusion proteins with EGFP were designated as β1AR·GFP, β2AR·GFP, or β-arrestin 2·GFP. The β1- and β2AR·β-arrestin 1 fusion proteins were constructed as follows. First, the entire coding region of β-arrestin 1 was amplified by two primers CGCGGGTACCATGGGCGACAAAGGGACACGAG and GCGCCTGCAGCTATCTGTTGTTGAGGTGTGG (underlines show restriction sites of KpnI or PstI). The identity of the sequence of PCR product was confirmed by thermal cycling sequencing kit from Perkin Elmer. Then the entire coding region of β-arrestin 1 was ligated with the abovementioned β1- or β2ARs without stop codon into EcoRI andPstI of pCMV5 by help of two oligonucleotides GATCCAGGTGGTGGAGGAGGTAC and CTCCTCCACCACCTG for β1AR or GGTGGTGGAGGAGGTAC and CTCCTCCACCACCGGCC for β2AR. Because of these oligonucleotides, there are extra amino acids between β-arrestin 1 and each of receptors (Gly-His-Pro-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Thr for β1AR and Gly-Ala-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Thr for β2AR). The fusion protein of β-arrestin 1 with GFP was also constructed by ligation of the abovementioned β-arrestin 1 with pEGFP-N1. However, we could not detect the β-arrestin 1·GFP fusion protein as assessed by Western blotting and confocal microscopy (data not shown). Therefore, β-arrestin 2·GFP was used for monitoring the intracellular trafficking of the β-arrestin molecule upon agonist stimulation. Chimeric receptors of β1- and β2ARs were constructed by PCR. The positions of the junctions in chimeric β1- and β2ARs are as follows (numbers refer to amino acid positions in human β1- and β2AR sequences): β1(1–2)/β2(3–7), β1Met1-Phe129/β2Trp105-Leu413; β2(1–2)/β1(3–7), β2Met1-Phe104/β1Phe130-Val477; β1(1–4)/β2(5–7), β1Met1-Arg200/β2Ala176-Leu413; β2(1–4)/β1(5–7), β2Met1-Arg175/β1Ala201-Val477; β1(1–5)/β2(6–7), β1Met1-Phe248/β2Gln224-Leu413; β2(1–5)/β1(6–7), β2Met1-Phe223/β1Arg249-Val477; β1(1–6)/β2(7), β1Met1-Ala348/β2Ile298-Leu413; β2(1–6)/β1(7), β2Met1-Val297/β1Phe349-Val477; β1(1–7)/β2(CT), β1Met1-Ser380/β2Pro330-Leu413; β2(1–7)/β1(CT), β2Met1-Ser329/β1Pro381-Val477. The identity of the sequences of PCR products was confirmed by thermal cycling sequencing kit from Perkin Elmer. Chimeric cDNAs were ligated into EcoRI andBamHI sites of pCMV5 or into NcoI andSalI sites of pEF/myc/cyto. The GST fusion proteins with the third intracellular loop of β1AR (Val247-Lys321), carboxyl tail of β1AR (Gly389-Val477), third intracellular loop of β2AR (Val222-Lys270), or carboxyl tail of β2AR (Arg328-Leu413) were used for determining the binding of in vitro translated β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2. For production of anti-β-arrestin antibody, the carboxyl tail of β-arrestin 1 (Phe349-Arg418) was amplified by PCR and ligated into pBluescript SK−. Oligonucleotides for PCR contained the restriction sites BamHI at the 5′-end or PstI at the 3′-end for facilitation of subcloning. After confirming the identity of the amplified sequence, the sequence was ligated intoBamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T vector. The GST fusion protein with the carboxyl tail of β-arrestin 1 was expressed, purified, and used for immunization against rabbits as described (11Kurose H. Arriza J.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 444-450PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody raised against the carboxyl tail of β-arrestin 1 recognized β-arrestin 1 but not β-arrestin 2 (data not shown). For production of antibodies recognizing GRK5 or GRK6, the regions (Ala471-Ser589 of GRK5 or Val477-Leu576 of GRK6) were amplified by PCR. The procedure similar to production of anti-β-arrestin antibody was used for expression and purification of GST fusion proteins and immunization. The entire coding region of β-arrestin 1 was amplified by the abovementioned two primers. As the sequence of β-arrestin 1 in pCMV5 has two restriction sites (KpnI at the 5′-end andPstI at the 3′-end), β-arrestin 1 was first ligated into the KpnI and XbaI sites in pTZ18R and then into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T1. The resulting fusion protein construct was used for transformation of the BL21(DE3)pLys strain. The fusion protein was then induced by the addition of 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 24 h at room temperature (12Furukawa H. Haga T. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was purified by the same method as that of other GST fusion proteins and was concentrated by Centricon-30. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. The cells were seeded at density of 2 × 105 cells for 6-well plates or 2 × 106 cells for 100-mm dishes before the day of transfection. Then appropriate amounts of plasmids (2 μg for 6-well plates or 8 μg for 100-mm dishes) were used for transfection with 5 or 20 μl of LipofectAMINE, according to the manufacture's instructions. Total amounts of plasmids were adjusted by the addition of vector DNA. The cells were used for assays two days after transfection. HEK293 cells in 6-well dishes that had been transiently transfected were incubated at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM with or without 10 μm isoproterenol for the indicated time. The cells were washed three times by ice-cold PBS and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 6 nm[3H]CGP-12177 in modified KRH buffer (136 mmNaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mmMgSO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After incubation, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and then the cell-associated radioactivities were counted. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 10 μmpropranolol. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Laser Scanning Confocal Imaging System from Bio-Rad Microscience using Nikon CFI PLN APOCHROMAT 60X WI lens. For monitoring the intracellular trafficking of β1- or β2AR upon the receptor activation, HEK293 cells transfected with the EGFP-tagged β1AR (β1AR·GFP) or β2AR (β2AR·GFP) as described above were plated on 35-mm glass bottom dishes. On the day of experiment, the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The β1AR- or β2AR·GFP fluorescent signals were collected sequentially using single line excitation (488 nm). The cells were stimulated with 100 μm isoproterenol for 10 min at room temperature. For monitoring the translocation of β-arrestin in living cells, HEK293 cells were transfected with β1- or β2ARs with β-arrestin 2·GFP. The medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4. The β-arrestin 2·GFP signals were collected sequentially using single line excitation (488 nm). The cells were stimulated with 100 μm isoproterenol for the indicated time at room temperature. CHO cell lines stably expressing β1AR or β2AR were established by Sato et al. (8Sato Y. Kurose H. Isogaya M. Nagao T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 315: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and used for the present experiment. The levels of expression of β1AR and β2AR were 247 ± 39 and 339 ± 43 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Adenylyl cyclase activities were determined by the method of Salomon et al. (13Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Samples containing 30 μg of membrane protein, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 11.6 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm EDTA, 0.12 mm [3H]ATP (50 μCi/ml), 50 μm GTP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 2.8 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 4 unit/ml pyruvate kinase, 20 unit/ml myokinase, and either GST·β-arrestin 1 or GST at the indicated concentrations, 10 μm forskolin or 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in total volume of 50 μl. Therefore, the concentration of β1AR or β2AR was about 0.15 or 0.20 nm, respectively. The reaction was stopped by placing the samples on ice and adding 1 ml of the solution containing 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mmcAMP, and [14C]cAMP (∼10,000 cpm/ml). The radiolabeled cAMP was separated by sequential chromatography (Dowex cation exchange resin and aluminum oxide), and the radioactivities were counted. The plasmids carrying the coding regions of β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 in pTZ18R were transcribed and translated in vitro using TNT quick coupled transcription/translation system in the presence of l-[35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instruction. GST fusion proteins (100 μg) with the third intracellular loop or the carboxyl tail of β1- or β2ARs were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (50 μl). The resulting Sepharose beads were incubated with in vitro translated β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 in 60 μl consisting of 30 μl of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100), 20 μl of 50% glycerol, and 10 μl of in vitro translated β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After being washed four times with binding buffer at 4 °C, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The radiolabeled β-arrestins were detected by autoradiography. We have examined agonist-induced internalization by measuring the numbers of β1- or β2ARs remaining at the cell surface after agonist stimulation. HEK 293 cells transiently expressing β1- or β2ARs were stimulated by isoproterenol for 5–45 min. The number of β2ARs remaining at the cell surface was decreased about 36% by isoproterenol stimulation for 45 min (Fig. 1). In contrast to β2AR, the number of β1ARs was not decreased by agonist stimulation. This result is consistent with the previous report (6Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T. Nantel F. Bonin H. Valiquette M. Frielle T. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar, 7Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26215-26219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To visualize the location of βARs, EGFP was fused to the carboxyl terminus of β1- or β2ARs. The βAR·GFP fusion proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells, and the fluorescence was monitored with confocal microscopy. Both β1- and β2ARs were localized at the plasma membrane in the resting state (Fig.2). β2AR·GFP appeared in membrane-associated vesicles as a result of agonist stimulation and then in endocytic vesicles that were randomly distributed throughout the cytosol of the cell (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to β2AR, β1AR remained at the plasma membrane even after agonist stimulation for 10 min (Fig. 2 A). β1AR changed neither its distribution nor concentration at any of the specialized regions of the cell surface upon agonist stimulation (Fig. 2 A). These results show that β1AR is resistant to the agonist-induced internalization under the cellular environment in which β2AR can internalize.Figure 2The subcellular distribution of EGFP-tagged β1- or β2ARs upon agonist stimulation.

All experiments were performed six times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been reported that overexpression of GRK2, β-arrestin 1, or β-arrestin 2 restores the agonist-induced internalization of an internalization-defective mutant Y326A-β2AR (2Ferguson S.S.G. Ménard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.-M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possibility that overexpression of GRKs or β-arrestins overcomes the resistance of β1AR to the agonist-induced internalization. β1AR alone or β1AR with β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, or one of the GRKs were expressed in HEK293 cells, and the number of β1ARs remaining at the cell surface after agonist stimulation were determined by the [3H]CGP-12177 binding method. Fig. 3 A shows that β1AR was internalized 10–20% by agonist stimulation even when β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, or various GRKs were overexpressed. In contrast to β1AR, agonist stimulation for 10 or 30 min decreased the number of the cell surface receptors of β2AR to 69.4 ± 5.8 or 59.5 ± 3.3%, respectively (Fig. 3 A). When β2AR was coexpressed with β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2, a slight increase in internalization of β2AR was observed upon receptor stimulation for 10 min but not 30 min. Overexpression of various GRKs and β-arrestin 1 was confirmed by Western blotting using polyclonal antibody to recognize each of the GRKs or β-arrestin 1 (Fig.3 B). Because the antibody raised against the carboxyl tail of β-arrestin 1 did not recognize β-arrestin 2, the expression of β-arrestin 2 was not confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). However, overexpression of β-arrestin 2 slightly enhanced the agonist-induced internalization of β1- and β2ARs. Therefore, we concluded that overexpression of GRK, β-arrestin 1, or β-arrestin 2 is not enough for β1AR to efficiently internalize upon agonist stimulation. To characterize the interaction of β1AR with β-arrestin in living cells, we expressed β-arrestin 2·GFP to visualize intracellular trafficking of β-arrestin 2 upon activation of β1- or β2ARs. The β-arrestin 2·GFP was functional as assessed by facilitation of agonist-induced internalization of β1- and β2ARs (Fig.3 A). The fluorescence of β-arrestin 2·GFP in the cells was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and did not show any apparent enhanced localization at the plasma membrane (Fig.4). This is consistent with the previous report (14Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). When β2AR was stimulated with isoproterenol, β-arrestin 2·GFP rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B). β-Arrestin 2·GFP appeared to localize diffusely at the plasma membrane at first and showed with time a clustered pattern at specific portions of the cell surface (possibly coated pits). However, β-arrestin 2·GFP translocating to the plasma membrane did not traffic along with activated β2AR into endocytic vesicles. In the case of β1AR, β-arrestin 2·GFP evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm in the absence of agonist stimulation and rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane upon β1AR stimulation (Fig. 4 A). However, activation of β1AR did not result in a punctate pattern of β-arrestin 2·GFP fluorescence, in contrast to activation of β2AR. Furthermore, β-arrestin 2·GFP translocating to the plasma membrane returned to the cytoplasm 10–30 min after agonist stimulation (Fig. 4 A). β-Arrestin 2·GFP did not translocate upon agonist stimulation when the cells were not transfected with β1- or β2ARs (data not shown). Therefore, these results demonstrate at the cellular level that β-arrestin 2 interacts transiently with β1AR upon agonist stimulation. To determine which region of β1- or β2ARs is responsible for differential behavior of agonist-induced internalization and intracellular trafficking of β-arrestin 2·GFP, we constructed and analyzed various chimeras of β1- and β2ARs. The structures of β1/β2 chimeric receptors are shown in Fig.5 A. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with one of these chimeric receptors were stimulated by 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min, and the numbers of receptors remaining at the cell surface were determined by binding assays. Fig.5 B shows the internalization behavior of the chimeras that replaced the various regions of β1AR with the corresponding regions of β2AR. The chimera (β1 (1Böhm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W.

However, the magnitude of agonist-induced internalization of this chimera was not the same as that of wild type β2AR. This result suggests that another region is necessary for full internalization of β2AR. The chimera (β1(1–5)/β2 (6Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T. Nantel F. Bonin H. Valiquette M. Frielle T. Bouvier M. Mol.

These results suggest that the third intracellular loop and the carboxyl tail of β2AR are major regions of agonist-induced internalization. The replacement of the carboxyl tail of β2AR with the corresponding region of β1AR resulted in the chimera (β2(1–7)/β1(CT)) that showed the decreased magnitude of agonist-induced internalization (Fig. 5 C). However, the magnitude of internalization of this chimera was still higher than that of wild type β1AR (p < 0.05 versus β1AR), suggesting that the carboxyl tail is not the sole determinant of internalization. The replacement of the third intracellular loop to the carboxyl tail of β2AR with the corresponding regions of β1AR further decreased the magnitude of internalization. These results suggest that the differences in the third intracellular loop and the carboxyl tail between β1AR and β2AR explain the differential behavior of agonist-induced internalization. To determine whether these regions are responsible for differential trafficking of β-arrestin 2·GFP upon agonist stimulation in living cells, two chimeras (β1(1–5)/β2 (6Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T.

In the chimera β1(1–5)/β2(6–7), β-arrestin 2·GFP translocated to the plasma membrane by agonist stimulation and stayed at the plasma membrane during agonist stimulation (Fig. 6 A). This trafficking behavior of β-arrestin 2·GFP is similar to that observed upon agonist stimulation of wild type β2AR. In chimera β2(1–5)/β1(6–7), β-arrestin 2·GFP translocated to the plasma membrane by agonist stimulation. However, β-arrestin 2·GFP returned to the cytoplasm even though the chimera was continuously stimulated by agonist (Fig. 6 B). This trafficking pattern of β-arrestin 2·GFP is similar to that of β1AR upon agonist stimulation. These results suggest that the intracellular third loop and the carboxyl tail determine the differential behavior of β-arrestin 2·GFP induced by agonist stimulation.Figure 6Translocation of β-arrestin 2· GFP fusion protein upon chimeric β1(1–5)/β2(6–7)- or β2(1–5)/β1(6–7)-AR activation in HEK293 cells.

We have shown that overexpression of one member of the family, protein targeting to glycogen (PTG), causes large increases in glycogen storage in isolated hepatocytes or intact rat liver. In the current study, we have compared the metabolic and regulatory properties of PTG (expressed in many tissues), with two other members of the gene family, GL (expressed primarily in liver) and GM/RGl (expressed primarily in striated muscle). Adenovirus-mediated expression of these proteins in hepatocytes led to the following key observations. 1) GLhas the highest glycogenic potency among the three forms studied. 2) Glycogen synthase activity ratio is much higher in GL-overexpressing cells than in PTG or GM/RGl-overexpressing cells. Thus, at moderate levels of GL overexpression, glycogen synthase activity is increased by insulin treatment, but at higher levels of GLexpression, insulin is no longer required to achieve maximal synthase activity. In contrast, cells with high levels of PTG overexpression retain dose-dependent regulation of glycogen synthesis and glycogen synthase enzyme activity by insulin. 3) GL- and GM/RGl-overexpressing cells exhibit a strong glycogenolytic response to forskolin, whereas PTG-overexpressing cells are less responsive. This difference may be explained in part by a lesser forskolin-induced increase in glycogen phosphorylase activity in PTG-overexpressing cells. Based on these results, we suggest that expression of either GL or GM/RGlin liver of diabetic animals may represent a strategy for lowering of blood glucose levels in diabetes.

PP1 causes stimulation of glycogen synthase and suppression of glycogen phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase activities by dephosphorylation of these enzymes. Glycogen-targeting subunits bind directly to the glycogen particle, and possibly to glycogen synthase, phosphorylase kinase, and glycogen phosphorylase (1Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePoali-Roach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W.

Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Based on these properties, it has been suggested that glycogen-targeting subunits function as a “scaffold” that assembles and facilitates the regulation of enzymes of glycogen metabolism (4Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 5Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Four members of the family of glycogen-targeting subunits of PP1 have been identified. The first to be characterized was a 126-kDa protein that is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle. The cDNA encoding this protein, initially termed RGl (for glycogen-binding regulatory subunit), was cloned from a rabbit muscle library (1Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePoali-Roach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This targeting subunit is also know as GM. Therefore, in what follows, it will be referred to as GM/RGl. Binding of GM/RGl to PP1 enhances dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase and causes activation of glycogenesis. The ability of GM/RGl to promote glycogen synthesis is hormonally regulated. Thus, glycogenolytic agents such as adrenaline cause phosphorylation of rabbit RGl at serine 67 (corresponding to serine 65 in the human isoform), and, in some reports, also serine 48 (corresponding to serine 46 in the human protein), resulting in dissociation and thus inactivation of the GM/RGl-PP1 complex (5Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 10Armstrong C.G. Browne G.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A second isoform, GL, is a 33-kDa protein that is expressed primarily in liver, and appears to be regulated allosterically by binding to phosphorylase a, but not by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (2Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Phosphorylase a binds to the C-terminal tail of GL, resulting in inhibition of the glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase phosphatase activities of PP1 (2Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A recently discovered 36-kDa isoform known as PTG (protein targeting to glycogen) (4Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), or PPP1R5 (3Doherty M.J. Young P.R. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) also activates glycogen synthesis, but is distinct from GL in that it has a wide tissue distribution. Finally, an isoform termed PPP1R6 has recently emerged, which, like PTG, is found in many tissues (10Armstrong C.G. Browne G.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Hepatic glycogen stores are reduced in concert with an increase in net hepatic glucose production in all forms of human diabetes studied to date (12Magnusson I. Rothman D.L. Katz L.D. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 13Cline G.W. Rothman D.L. Magnusson I. Katz L.D. Shulman G.I. J. Clin.

We have been investigating gene therapy strategies for repairing dysfunctional regulation of hepatic glucose disposal and production in type 2 diabetes. One approach that has been tried by our group and others is to increase the activity of the glucose phosphorylating enzyme glucokinase in liver (15O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D. Telemaque-Potts S. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 16Ferre T. Pujol A. Efren R. Bosch F. Valera A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Overexpression of glucokinase in rats (15O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D. Telemaque-Potts S. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or mice (16Ferre T.

Arbeeny C. et al.Diabetes. 1997; 46: 11-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) does in fact lower blood glucose levels and increase hepatic glycogen storage. However, in the rat studies, these effects were accompanied by a large increase in circulating free fatty acids and triglycerides (15O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D. Telemaque-Potts S. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), suggesting that this approach could exacerbate the hyperlipidemia typically found in type 2 diabetes. Increased expression of glycogen-targeting subunits could conceivably represent an alternative strategy, since these proteins should specifically enhance glucose disposal by activating glycogen synthesis. Consistent with this idea, we recently reported that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PTG in hepatocytes isolated from fasted rats results in profound activation of glycogen synthesis (6Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have also shown that overexpression of PTG in liver of normal rats enhances hepatic glucose disposal without affecting lipid homeostasis (18O'Doherty R. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, PTG-overexpressing liver cells were found to be largely refractory to glucagon or forskolin-mediated activation of glycogenolysis, raising concerns that overexpression of this protein could result in a glycogen storage disease. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether glycogen-targeting subunits of PP1 other than PTG might be more suitable candidates for improving hepatic glucose disposal. This was accomplished by construction of recombinant adenoviruses containing the cDNAs encoding PTG, GL, and GM/RGl and comparison of the metabolic and regulatory properties of the expressed gene products in isolated rat hepatocytes. Rat GLand rabbit GM/RGl (1Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePoali-Roach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cDNAs were cloned into the pACCMV-pLpA plasmid and recombinant adenoviruses (AdCMV-GL and AdCMV-GM/RGl) were produced using previously described methods (6Berman H.K.

The rat GL cDNA was prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a rat liver cDNA library using 5′-CGGGGTACC AAC TTC TCT TCA GGC TCT CCC ATG-3′ (sense, nucleotides 1–23) and 5′-CGCGGATCC CGC GTT CTC ACC TCC ACC TTG ATC-3′(antisense, nucleotides 980–1003) based on the published rat GLsequence (2Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Construction of a recombinant adenovirus containing the mouse PTG cDNA has been described elsewhere (6Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes were prepared from overnight fasted male Wistar rats by collagenase perfusion (20Massague J. Guinovart J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 543: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 nm insulin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 nmdexamethasone, 2 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma), and antibiotics (2 units/ml penicillin; 2 μg/ml streptomycin) and seeded onto collagen-coated plates at a cell density of 8 × 104 cells/cm2. After attachment (90 min at 37 °C), hepatocytes were treated for 1 h with AdCMV-PTG or AdCMV-GL, generally at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5, except where indicated in figure legends. Initial studies with AdCMV-GM/RGl indicated that expression of this glycogen-targeting subunit was less efficient than GL or PTG in hepatocytes. Thus, this virus was used at a m.o.i. of 15. Viruses were diluted in 2 ml of “culture medium” consisting of DMEM containing 1 mm glucose, 0.07% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 1 nm insulin, 10 nmdexamethasone, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. After viral treatment, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated, unless otherwise stated, for a further period of 24 h in culture medium containing variable glucose and other additives as indicated in figure legends. For longer incubation times, fresh medium was replenished after the first 24 h of culture. The procedure used was based on methods described previously (18O'Doherty R. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Jensen J. Serup P. Karlsen C. Nielsen T.F. Madsen O.D. J. Biol.

Total RNA was extracted from hepatocytes using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was diluted to 0.2 μg/μl in RNase-free water. First-strand cDNA was prepared using 1 μg of total RNA, using the Superscript RT kit and random hexamer primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was diluted 1:6 in distilled water, and PCR was carried out using 3 μl of the diluted cDNA and a PCR mix containing Taq DNA polymerase (2.5 units) and buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), dNTP mix (final concentrations of 40 mm amounts of each dNTP, except dCTP, which was present at 20 mm) (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1.25 μCi of [α-33P]dCTP (2000 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products) in a 25-μl reaction volume, following the instructions from Promega. Four primer sets (5 pmol of each primer) were included in each reaction. The first set, specific for mouse PTG (accession no. U89924), generates a 188-base pair PCR fragment, and the second set, specific for rat GL (accession no. S80360), generates a 232-base pair PCR as described previously (18O'Doherty R. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The third set, specific for rabbit GM/RGl (accession no. M65109; 5′-primer (5′-CTCAAAGGAAGATCTTATGCAAC-3′) and 3′-primer (5′-GTTTGCCAGTCATCTAAGGAC-3′)), generates a 162-base pair PCR fragment, and the fourth set, specific for α-tubulin (accession no. J00797; 5′primer (5′-GCGTGAGTGTATCTCCATCCA-3′) and 3′-primer (5′-GGTAGGTGCCAGTGCGAACTT-3′)), generates a 250-base pair PCR fragment and serves as an internal standard. PCR conditions were an initial incubation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 18 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The final PCR reactions were mixed with 98% formamide denaturing loading buffer and separated on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, containing 7m urea. The gel was subsequently dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and the resulting scan was analyzed using ImageQuant from Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA). To compare expression levels between the different glycogen-targeting subunits, we have accounted for differences in incorporation of [33P]dCTP for each amplified gene product. To do this, we divided the integrated volume for each band with the number of G and C nucleotides in the amplified sequence, which is 98 for PTG, 123 for GL, and 58 for GM/RGl. Glycogen content was measured by scraping cells into 30% KOH, boiling the extract for 15 min, and centrifuging at 5,000 × g for 5 min. Glycogen in the cleared supernatant was measured as described (22Newgard C.B. Hirsch L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content in the samples was determined by method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar), using the Bio-Rad assay kit. Glycogen synthase activity was assayed as described previously by measuring the incorporation of [14C]UDP-glucose into glycogen, in the presence or absence of 6.6 mm glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) (24Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The activity measured in the absence of Glc-6-P represents the active form of the enzyme, whereas the activity in the presence of 6.6 mm Glc-6-P represents total activity. The ratio of these two activities is known as the glycogen synthase “activity ratio” and is an estimate of the degree of activation of the enzyme. Activated glycogen phosphorylase (phosphorylase a) activity was assayed by measuring incorporation of [14C]glucose 1-phosphate into glycogen as described (25Coats W. Browner M. Fletterick R.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16113-16119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 200 μg of protein from a crude cell extract was added to 40 μl of assay mix containing 200 mm potassium fluoride, 1% glycogen, 10 mmcaffeine, 100 mm glucose 1-phosphate, and [14C]glucose 1-phosphate (3000 cpm/μl, specific activity of 234 mCi/mmol). PTG and GM/RGl protein levels were measured by immunoblot assay, using purified His-tagged PTG (containing 23 His residues) or a 67-kDa fragment of GM/RGl as internal standards for quantification and a previously described anti-PTG antibody (4Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) or an antibody raised against a purified fragment (amino acids 1–453) of GM/RGl. For determination of total glycogen phosphorylase or glycogen phosphorylase a levels by immunoblot analysis, hepatocytes were lysed at 4 °C in a buffer consisting of 50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitors (0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). For analysis of PP1 levels, extracts were prepared in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors as described above. Lysates were centrifuged at 600 × g, and the supernatants were collected. Extract aliquots containing 50 μg of protein were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking the membranes for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Igepal CA-630 and 4% nonfat dry milk, the blots were incubated with either an affinity-purified anti-phosphorylase a antibody at a 1:500 dilution, a crude antiserum that recognizes both phosphorylase a andb (measures total phosphorylase levels) at 1:1000 dilution, or an antibody that recognizes all forms of PP1 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) at a 1:1000 dilution at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were then incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit. The anti-phosphorylase a antibody was raised in rabbits against the peptide EKRRQI-pS-IRGIVG of the rat liver phosphorylase sequence, whereas the antibody against total glycogen phosphorylase (recognizing both the a and b forms) was raised against a peptide from the extreme N terminus of the rat liver glycogen phosphorylase sequence, MAKPLTDQEKRRQISIR. The latter antibody was found to be highly specific as a crude antiserum and was not affinity-purified. The anti-phosphorylase a antibody was diluted 1:1 with PBS, incubated with immobilized phosphopeptide, and eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5). After neutralization with 100 mm Tris (pH 8.8), the eluate was passed over immobilized EKRRQISIRGIVG peptide, to remove anti-phosphorylaseb antibody. The flow through, which contains the phosphorylase a-specific antibody, was collected and concentrated with an Amicon-10 filtration device. Both antibodies were then tested by immunoblot analysis against purified phosphorylasea and phosphorylase b (Sigma). In order to evaluate glycogen-targeting subunit expression, a multiplex PCR approach was used to measure the levels of GL, PTG, and GM/RGl mRNAs in rat hepatocytes 24 h after exposure to the various recombinant viruses, and glycogen content was measured in parallel hepatocyte samples. The studies depicted in the left-hand portions of Fig.1 (A–C) were conducted with viral titers of 5, 5, and 15 m.o.i. for AdCMV-PTG, AdCMV-GL, and AdCMV- GM/RGl, respectively. The left panel of Fig.1 A shows autoradiographs from four independent experiments, two with hepatocytes cultured at low glucose (1 mm) and two with hepatocytes at high glucose (20 mm). Since no significant effect of glucose concentration on adenovirus-mediated expression of any of the glycogen-targeting subunits was noted, densitometric data were combined for the four separate experiments and summarized quantitatively as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1 B. This analysis shows that the levels of PTG and GL expression achieved in AdCMV-GL and AdCMV-PTG-treated cells were equivalent. Endogenous GL was detectable in untreated rat hepatocytes, whereas endogenous PTG was not detected, since amplification of PTG was performed with primers specific to the mouse cDNA, which is the form contained in the AdCMV-PTG virus. Densitometric analysis reveals that GL is overexpressed by approximately 20-fold in AdCMV-GL expressing cells relative to untreated control cells. GM/RGl mRNA was expressed at approximately 35% the levels of GL or PTG, despite the fact that 3 times the number of AdCMV-GM/RGlviral particles were used relative to AdCMV-GL or AdCMV-PTG. At the levels of expression described in Fig. 1 (A andB), GL-overexpressing cells had significantly higher levels of glycogen than PTG-overexpressing cells, whereas AdCMV-GM/RGl treated cells contained only 11% and 7% of the glycogen in AdCMV-PTG or AdCMV-GL-treated cells respectively (Fig. 1 C, left). In order to determine whether the difference in glycogenic potency of GL and GM/RGl was due to intrinsic differences in biologic activities of the expressed proteins or simply related to different levels of transgene expression, we performed a second set of studies at a reduced level of GLoverexpression. As shown in the right-hand portions of Fig. 1 (A and B), treatment of hepatocytes with 1 m.o.i. of AdCMV-GL or 15 m.o.i. of AdCMV-GM/RGl caused GM/RGl RNA to be expressed at 3 times the level of GL. Despite this, glycogen content in GL-overexpressing hepatocytes was double that in GM/RGl-overexpressing cells (Fig.1 C). Thus, GL has a clearly enhanced intrinsic capacity to promote glycogen synthesis relative to GM/RGl. The low potency of GM/RGl for stimulation of glycogenesis was not overcome by adding even higher titers of AdCMV-GM/RGl virus up to 120 m.o.i. (data not shown). To determine if the limited glycogenic effect of increasing titers of the AdCMV-GM/RGl virus was related to a ceiling in production of the recombinant protein, immunoblot analysis was performed on cells overexpressing PTG or GM/RGl, using purified recombinant proteins as internal quantification standards. As shown in Fig.2 A, in cells treated with 15 m.o.i. of AdCMV-GM/RGl and 5 m.o.i. of AdCMV-PTG, GM/RGl is expressed at about one-third the level of PTG (when blots are normalized for sizes of recombinant and standard proteins), roughly confirming the results of the RT-PCR analysis in Fig. 1. Increasing the dose of AdCMV-PTG from 1 to 5 m.o.i. had a large effect on both PTG protein level and glycogen accumulation (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, increasing the dose of AdCMV-GM/RGl from 15 to 30 m.o.i. caused a clear increase in immunodetectable GM/RGl protein without an increase in glycogen content (Fig. 2 B). These experiments define an inherent limitation in glycogenic effect of overexpressed GM/RGl in hepatocytes that is independent of the level of expression of the recombinant protein. All experiments that follow in this study were conducted at levels of PTG, GL, and GM/RGl overexpression described in the left-hand portions of Fig. 1(A and B), except in Fig. 6 as noted.Figure 6Insulin regulation of glycogen synthase activity in hepatocytes overexpressing PTG , GL, or GM/RG1. Hepatocytes were isolated from fasted rats, treated with 5 m.o.i. (AdCMV-PTG, AdCMV-GL) or 2.5 m.o.i. (AdCMV-GL, half-dose) of the indicated adenoviruses for 1 h, and cultured in DMEM containing 20 mm glucose with or without 100 nm insulin for 24 h (see legend at left in the figure). Cells were then harvested, and glycogen synthase activity ratio was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Results represent the mean ± S.E. for three independent experiments, except for treatment with the half-dose of AdCMV-GL, which comprises one set of experiments performed in triplicate. The symbol * indicates that glycogen synthase activity ratio was higher in cells cultured with insulin than cells cultured in the absence of the hormone for a given viral treatment, with a significance of p< 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously shown that overexpression of PTG in hepatocytes results in enhanced glycogen synthesis at low glucose or even in its absence in the culture medium (6Berman H.K.

To determine whether this property is shared by other glycogen-targeting subunits, glycogen content was measured 24 h after viral treatment in cells cultured at different glucose concentrations. The time point for these experiments was chosen based on a comparison of cells harvested at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after viral treatment. These studies revealed that glycogen synthesis was in a linear phase at low glucose (1 mm), or approaching maximum at high glucose (20 mm) in cells overexpressing each of the glycogen-targeting subunits at the 24 h time point (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, GL and PTG overexpression caused significant accumulation of glycogen in the absence of glucose or at low concentrations, but also allowed potent activation of glycogen accumulation as glucose concentrations were raised. Glucose increased glycogen synthesis more effectively in GL-overexpressing cells than in cells overexpressing PTG, these effects becoming apparent at glucose concentrations of ≥3 mm. At 20 mmglucose, GL-overexpressing cells accumulated 54% more glycogen that PTG-overexpressing cells. In contrast to GLand PTG, overexpression of GM/RGl caused no significant increases in glycogen synthesis at low glucose, whereas high glucose induced a maximal increase of glycogen content of 3.3-fold relative to control cells, only 7.5% of the amount in GL-overexpr"
https://openalex.org/W1554441967,"The tectonics of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, are complex. This satellite probably hosts a subsurface water ocean, but the thickness of the outer ice crust is poorly constrained and the episodic presence of liquid water at the surface is debated. We argue that some surface features of Europa are formed by soft ice that is heated by viscous dissipation of tidal motion along faults, and do not depend on a shallow ocean. Our model suggests that transient pockets of liquid water or brine could form at shallow depths in the crust."

Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) and substance P (SP) were used to activate Gq/11, cyclopentyl adenosine (CPA) was used to activate Gi3, and acetylcholine (ACh) was used to activate both Gq/11 and Gi3 via m3 and m2 receptors, respectively. CCK-8 and SP increased only Gαq/11, and CPA increased only Gαi3 in caveolin immunoprecipitates; caveolin and other G proteins were not increased. ACh increased both Gαq/11 and Gαi3 in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion: only Gαq/11was increased in the presence of an m2 antagonist, and only Gαi3 was increased in the presence of an m3 antagonist. To determine whether transient G protein binding to caveolin affected subsequent responses mediated by the same G protein, PLC-β activity was measured in cells stimulated sequentially with two different agonists that activate either the same or a different G protein. After treatment of the cells with ACh and an m2 antagonist, the phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) response to CCK-8 and SP, but not CPA, was decreased; conversely, after treatment of the cells with ACh and an m3 antagonist, the PLC-β response to CPA, but not CCK-8 or SP, was decreased. Similarly, after treatment with CCK-8 or SP, the PLC-β response mediated by Gq/11 only was decreased, whereas after treatment with CPA, the PLC-β response mediated by Gi3only was decreased. A caveolin-binding Gαq/11 fragment blocked the binding of activated Gαq/11 but not Gαi3 to caveolin-3 and prevented desensitization of the PLC-β response mediated only by other Gq/11-coupled receptors. A caveolin-binding Gαi3 fragment had the reverse effect.

Muscle cell homogenates were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min, and the crude membranes were suspended in 20 mm HEPES medium (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm EDTA and 240 mmNaCl. The membranes were diluted 20-fold and incubated at 37 °C with 60 nm [35S]GTPγS in a medium containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 μm EDTA, and 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction was stopped with 10 volumes of 100 mm Tris-HCl medium (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 μm GTP, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h on ice in wells coated with specific G protein antibodies. The wells were washed with phosphate buffer solution containing 0.05% Tween 20, and the radioactivity from each well was counted. PLC-β activity was measured from the formation of total inositol phosphates in muscle cells prelabeled with myo-[3H]inositol as described previously (39Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G945-G951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 10 ml of cell suspension (2 × 106cell/ml) were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol (15 μCi/ml) for 3 h at 31 °C. The cells were centrifuged at 350 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 10 ml of fresh HEPES medium. The cells were treated with one agonist for 10 min and centrifuged again at 350 × g for 5 min. Various agonists were then added to 0.5 ml of cell suspension for 30 s, and the reaction was terminated with 940 μl of chloroform:methanol:HCl (50:100:1 v/v/v). After chloroform (310 μl) and water (310 μl) were added, the samples were vortexed, and the phases were separated by centrifugation at 1000 × gfor 15 min. The upper aqueous phase was applied to Dowex AG-1 × 8 columns. After washing, inositol phosphates were eluted with 5 ml of 0.8 m ammonium formate with 0.1 m formic acid, and the eluates were collected into scintillation vials and counted in gel phase after addition of 10 ml of scintillant. The results were expressed as cpm/106 cells. Smooth muscle cells (2–3 × 106cells/ml) were lysed by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 60 mm octyl glucoside, and the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was precleared by incubation with 0.1% albumin-coated protein A-Sepharose for 6 h at 4 °C and then incubated overnight with polyclonal caveolin-3 antibody at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml. Protein A-Sepharose was then added for 1 h, and the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and boiled in Laemmli buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% acrylamide gel, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose paper, and probed with antibodies to Gαi3, Gαq/11, or caveolin-3. After incubation with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, the proteins were visualized using the Super Signal ULTRA chemiluminescent substrate. The intensity of the protein band on Hyperfilm-ECL was determined by densitometry. Caveolin-enriched membrane fractions derived from intestinal smooth muscle were prepared by the method of Song et al. (9Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S.

Dispersed muscle cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 2 ml of 500 mmsodium carbonate (pH 11.0) containing 0.2 mm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 μg/ml of leupeptin and homogenized with a Polytron tissue grinder (three 10-s bursts) and by sonication (three 20-s bursts). The homogenate was adjusted to 45% sucrose in MBS (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, and 0.15 mNaCl), placed in an ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with two 4-ml layers of 35 and 5% sucrose in MBS containing 250 mmsodium carbonate. The gradient was centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 20 h. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected sequentially from the top and designated as fractions 1–12. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide gels); after transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies to caveolin-3 and various Gα subunits. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence assay. For protein immunoprecipitation from caveolin-enriched fractions, the purified membranes were diluted to 2 mg protein/ml in lysis buffer, incubated on ice for 1 h, and centrifuged. The lysate was precleared by 1-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose and then incubated overnight with caveolin-3 antibody and for 2 h with protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of 2-fold concentrated Laemmli buffer; after separation on SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblot analysis with caveolin-3 and Gα antibodies was performed. PIP2 was measured by thin layer chromatography in caveolar membranes as described previously (40Murthy K.S. Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J.

A 20-ml cell suspension (106 cells/ml) was incubated with 500 μCi of [32P]Pi at 31 °C for 3 h. Duplicate samples (106 cells/ml) were incubated at 31 °C with ACh (0.1 μm), cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8 1 nm), SP (1 μm), and CPA (1 μm) separately for 30 s. The reaction was terminated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min followed by addition of 1 ml of HEPES buffer (25 mm) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The mixture was incubated for 10 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatant and pellets were extracted with 1.8 ml of chloroform-methanol-HCl (100:200:2 v/v/v). The organic phase was analyzed for PIP2 by thin layer chromatography. The results were expressed as cpm/106cells. Binding of [3H]scopolamine to dispersed intestinal smooth muscle cells was done as described previously (37Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21317-21324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Muscle cells were suspended in HEPES medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Triplicate 0.5-ml aliquots (106 cells/ml) were incubated for 15 min with 1 nm[3H]scopolamine alone or with acetylcholine. Bound and free radioligand were separated by rapid filtration under reduced pressure through 5-μm polycarbonate Nucleopore filters and washed four times with 3 ml of ice-cold HEPES medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific binding (28 ± 6%) was calculated as the amount of radioactivity in the presence of 10 μmacetylcholine. [3H]Scopolamine binding was measured in control cells and in cells treated for 10 min with 1 nmCCK-8, 1 μm SP, 1 μm CPA, or 0.1 μm ACh. Two peptides corresponding to the caveolin-binding domains of Gαq/11, Tyr192–Ala206 (YPFDLQSVIFRMVDA) and Gαi3, Thr187–Val201(THFTFKELYFKMFDV) were synthesized by the solid phase method and purified (95–99%) by high performance liquid chromatography (Peptidogenic, CA). [2-3H]Inositol, [3H]scopolamine, [35S]GTPγS, and [32P]orthophosphate were obtained from NEN Life Science Products; Dowex AG-1 × 8 resin was from Bio-Rad; polyclonal Gαq/11, Gαi1/2, and Gαi3 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and caveolin-3 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). All other reagents were from Sigma. G protein activation was determined directly from the increase in agonist-stimulated binding of [35S]GTPγS to specific Gα subunits in solubilized intestinal smooth muscle cell membranes. CCK-8 and SP selectively activated Gq/11, whereas CPA selectively activated Gi3 (Table I). ACh activated both Gq/11 and Gi3 via m3 and m2 receptors, respectively, as shown previously (37Murthy K.S.

Immunoblot analysis of 12 fractions derived from intestinal smooth muscle cells showed that caveolin-3 was confined to low density fractions 5 and 6, whereas G proteins (Gαq, Gαi1/2, and Gαi3) were present in fractions 5 and 6, as well as in membrane fractions 9–12 (Fig. 1). The pattern was similar to that obtained in other cell types (15Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

A specific redistribution of G proteins to caveolin-enriched fractions (combined fractions 5 and 6) occurred upon treatment of smooth muscle cells with agonists. Treatment with CCK-8 (1 nm) for 10 min caused a significant increase of Gαq/11 (154 ± 18%; p < 0.01) but not Gαi3, Gαi2, or Gαi1 in caveolin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2). Conversely, treatment with CPA (1 μm) caused a significant increase of Gαi3 (168 ± 24%; p < 0.01), but not Gαq/11, Gαi2, or Gαi1, in caveolin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2). There was no change in caveolin-3 after treatment with either agonist (Fig.2). The increase in Gα binding to caveolin paralleled agonist-induced activation of the corresponding G protein (TableI). A similar pattern was obtained in caveolin immunoprecipitates derived from cell lysates. Treatment of muscle cells with CCK-8 or SP increased Gαq/11 in caveolin-3 immunoprecipitates by 187 ± 22% (p < 0.01) and 181 ± 24% (p < 0.01), respectively, but had no effect on Gαi3 (Fig.3). In contrast, treatment of muscle cells with CPA (1 μm) increased Gαi3 in caveolin-3 immunoprecipitates by 173 ± 18% (p < 0.01) but had no effect on Gαq/11 (Fig. 3). Gαi2 and Gαi1 are not activated by CCK-8, SP, or CPA (Table I) and did not increase in caveolin-3 immunoprecipitates upon treatment of muscle cells with all three agonists (Fig. 4). There was no increase in caveolin-3 in caveolin immunoprecipitates or in Gαq/11and Gαi3 immunoprecipitates after treatment with any agonist (Fig. 4).Figure 4Immunoblot analysis of Gαi1/2 and caveolin-3. Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with caveolin-3 antibody (A) and Gαi3 or Gαq/11antibody (B). Samples from caveolin immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with Gαi1/2 or caveolin-3 antibody; samples from Gαq/11 and Gαi3 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with caveolin-3 antibody. There was no increase in caveolin-3 or Gαi1/2 from basal levels after treatment with various agonists.

The increase in Gαq/11 was abolished by the m3 receptor antagonist, 4-DAMP, but was not affected by the m2 receptor antagonist, methoctramine, whereas the increase in Gαi3 was abolished by methoctramine but was not affected by 4-DAMP (Fig. 3). In these experiments also there was no increase in Gαi1 or Gαi2 in caveolin immunoprecipitates and no increase in caveolin-3 either in caveolin immunoprecipitates or Gαq/11 and Gαi3 immunoprecipitates (Fig.4). The m2 but not m3 receptors were detected in caveolin immunoprecipitates after treatment of muscle cells with ACh (Fig.4 C).

In vivo, the gain of the cochlear amplifier is regulated by the efferent neurotransmitter acetylcholine through the modulation of outer hair cell motility. Little is known, however, regarding the molecular mechanisms activated by acetylcholine. In this study, intracellular signaling pathways involving the small GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 have been identified as regulators of outer hair cell motility. Changes in cell length (slow motility) and in the amplitude of electrically induced movement (fast motility) were measured in isolated outer hair cells patch clamped in whole-cell mode, internally perfused through the patch pipette with different inhibitors and activators of these small GTPases while being externally stimulated with acetylcholine. We found that acetylcholine induces outer hair cell shortening and a simultaneous increase in the amplitude of fast motility through Rac1 and Cdc42 activation. In contrast, a RhoA- and Rac1-mediated signaling pathway induces outer hair cell elongation and decreases fast motility amplitude. These two opposing processes provide the basis for a regulatory mechanism of outer hair cell motility.

J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4575-4585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Damage of this mechanism, for instance by acoustic trauma, aminoglycoside antibiotics, or simply aging, is a common cause of sensory neural hearing loss afflicting millions of people around the world. At the core of the cochlear amplifier are the outer hair cells (OHCs).1 OHCs are specific to the mammalian cochlea, probably reflecting an adaptation to the frequency and dynamic range demands of mammalian hearing (2Lim D.J. Kalinec F. Kidney Int. 1998; 53 Suppl. 65: 104-113Google Scholar). They are cylindrical with lengths ranging between 10 and 100 μm and a rather constant diameter of ∼8 μm. Cochlear OHCs can reversibly change their length by two different mechanisms: slow and fast OHC motility (3Holley M.C. Dallos P. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. 8. Springer-Verlag, New York1996: 386-434Google Scholar). Slow OHC motility occurs in seconds and involves cytoskeletal reorganization (4Dulon D. Schacht J. Am. J. Otol. 1992; 13: 108-112PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, fast motility works in the microsecond range and is voltage-driven, with hyperpolarization causing elongation and depolarization shortening of the OHCs (5Brownell W.E. Bader C.R. Bertrand D. de Ribaupierre Y. Science. 1985; 227: 194-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar, 6Ashmore J.F. J. Physiol.

We and others have recently demonstrated that OHC fast motility is mediated by the concerted direct action of a large number of independent molecular motors embedded in the OHC lateral plasma membrane (8Holley M.C.

Kachar B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 569-580PubMed Google Scholar). Compelling evidence suggests that the gain of the cochlear amplifier is regulated in vivo through the modulation of OHC motility by acetylcholine (ACh) released from terminals of the medial efferent system (for review, see Refs. 13Wiederhold M.L. Altschuler R.A. Hoffman D.W. Bobbin R.P. Neurobiology of Hearing. Raven Press, New York1986: 349-371Google Scholar and 14Guinan J.J. Dallos P. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. 8. Springer-Verlag, New York1996: 435-502Google Scholar). Little is known, however, regarding the molecular mechanisms activated by ACh in OHCs. Several lines of evidence have led us to consider the involvement of members of the Rho (Ras homologous) family of small GTPases in this process. For instance, early studies have established that RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 play a crucial role in cytoskeletal reorganization and mediate different types of motility in nonauditory cell populations (for review see Refs. 15Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar and 16Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5106) Google Scholar). In addition, recent evidence has indicated that ACh activates Rho-mediated signaling pathways in neuroblastoma cells (17Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). More importantly, targets of Rho GTPases have been associated to sensorineural hearing loss. For example, a mutation in the Dia1 protein (a profilin ligand and target of Rho (18Watanabe N. Iwamura T. Shinoda T. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat.

King M.-C. Science. 1997; 278: 1315-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and mutations in another potential target of Rho, myosin VIIa, are responsible for human Usher syndrome type 1B (21Gibson F. Walsh J. Mburu P. Varela A. Brown K.A. Antonio M. Beisel K.W. Steel K.P. Brown S.D.M. Nature. 1995; 374: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 22Weil D. Blanchard S. Kaplan J. Guilford P.

The existence of a direct link between these pathways, OHC motility, and the physiology of the hearing system, however, remains unexplored. Thus, this is the first study to demonstrate that Rho proteins participate in the signaling cascade that ultimately regulates OHC motility in response to ACh. This finding is crucial for our understanding of a basic mechanism for both normal human hearing and deafness. Subcellular localization of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 was determined by confocal microscopy as described previously (24Kalinec F. Kalinec G. Negrini C. Kachar B. Hear. Res. 1997; 110: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Antibodies against RhoA were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and those against Rac1 and Cdc42 were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Samples were double-labeled with the actin probe rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and visualized using a Zeiss LSM-410 confocal microscope with objectives Plan-Apo 63X (numerical aperture = 1.4) and C-Apo 40X (numerical aperature = 1.2). For Western blot analysis, total cell homogenates from cochlea and brain of guinea pigs were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30 μg of protein/lane), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with the individual antibodies described above. The reaction was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using a peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). OHCs were isolated from cochleas of young (200–300 g) guinea pigs by microdissection and suspended in Leibowitz L-15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a perfusion chamber on an Axiovert 135 inverted microscope stage. Only cells that met established criteria for healthy OHCs were used in these studies (25Zajic G. Schacht J. Hear. Res. 1987; 26: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). L-15 medium was continuously renovated at a rate of 50 μl/min using a two-way perfusion system (KDS-120, KD Scientific, Boston, MA). OHCs were patch clamped (−70 mV rest potential; 4–5-megaohmΩ pipette access resistance) at or immediately above the nuclear region using an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) and a Patchman electronic micromanipulator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Patch pipettes were filled with internal perfusion buffer (120 mm KF, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES) adjusted with Trizma Base to pH 7.4 and with glucose to 300 mosm. Cells were perfused through the same patch pipette with the following compounds (either alone or combined) dissolved in perfusion buffer: 100 μm GDPβS, GTPγS, or exoenzyme C3 fromClostridium botulinum (specific RhoA inhibitor (26Udagawa T.

Silvio Gutkind, NIDCR, National Institutes of Health). Mutant proteins were prepared according to the method described by Grieco et al. (30Grieco F. Hay J.M. Hull R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 856-858PubMed Google Scholar) using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GTPγS (100 μm) was always co-perfused with the inhibitors and activators of Rho GTPases to reconstitute the cellular response to ACh as well as to favor mutant proteins in their competition with the endogenous Rho GTPases. In a few experiments, commercially available dominant negative and constitutively activated mutants of the small GTPases (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) were used with similar results. After being patch clamped, cells were permitted to stabilize in their new mechanical conditions for 8–10 min. Subsequently, Leibowitz L-15 and ACh (100 μm, Sigma) were delivered to the basolateral wall of the cells (∼0.15 μl/s) using a computer-controlled perfusion system (DAD-12, ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY). Cells were first perfused with L-15 during two consecutive periods of 73 s each to detect any response associated either with the experimental procedure or the stimulation of stretch-activated channels known to be present in the OHC lateral wall (31Iwasa K.H. Li M. Jia M. Kachar B. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 133: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). During this initial phase, OHCs were electrically stimulated four times with bursts of three depolarization (+50 mV)/hyperpolarization (−140 mV) cycles to elicit fast motility, a procedure that contributes to a faster mechanical stabilization of the cells. Next, cells were externally perfused for 98 s with either L-15 or ACh, and electrically stimulated as described above. Results plotted in Figs. 2 and 3correspond to the changes in cell length (slow motility) or fast motility amplitude induced by L-15 (Control) or ACh during this period. Finally, another electrical stimulation was performed during an additional perfusion with L-15 to test cell recovery. The osmolarity of every solution used in these experiments was controlled and adjusted to 300 ± 2 mosm with a μOsmette 5004 freezing-point osmometer (Precision Systems Inc., Natick, MA). Experiments were fully recorded on videotape and analyzed off-line using Adobe Photoshop 4.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc., San José, CA) and the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet). Changes in total cell length and fast motility amplitude were measured as described elsewhere (32Frolenkov G.I. Kalinec F. Tavartkiladze G.A. Kachar B. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1665-1672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with a resolution better than 0.1 μm. Values were expressed as percentages of total cell length (slow motility) or fast motility amplitude measured in the same cells immediately before external perfusion with L-15 (Control) or ACh. Arcsine transformed data from a total of 350 cells was statistically analyzed with ANOVA (analysisof variance) techniques by using the software StatView 4.1 and SuperAnova (Abacus, Berkeley, CA). The expression pattern of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in the guinea pig organ of Corti was investigated using Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy. Fig. 1 shows that the immunoreactivity for these proteins was more intense in OHCs than in other organ of Corti cell populations. In addition, there is a clear co-localization of these small GTPases with the actin cytoskeleton of OHCs, especially at the cuticular plate, infracuticular network, and basolateral wall. Subsequently, we explored the regulatory role of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 on OHC motility. Changes in cell length (slow motility) and in the amplitude of electrically induced movement (fast motility) were measured in isolated OHCs patch clamped in the whole-cell mode, internally perfused with different pharmacological and molecular inhibitors and activators of that small GTPases, and externally stimulated with ACh as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The involvement of G proteins in the modulation of OHC motility by ACh was suggested by preliminary results showing a progressive loss of response to ACh in patch clamped OHCs. Reversal of this trend by the addition of either GTP or GTPγS to the pipette buffer indicated that a relative depletion of endogenous GTP because of diffusion into the patch pipette may be occurring during the experimental procedure and that GTP was essential for the OHC response to ACh. In our experimental conditions, and in the presence of GTPγS in the patch pipette, ACh induced a significant shortening (equivalent to −0.6 ± 0.1% of the total cell length) in OHCs. In contrast, ACh did not induce any change in OHC motility either in absence of GTPγS or its replacement by GDPβS (Fig.2 A). Even though these results confirm the involvement of GTP-binding proteins in the response of OHC to ACh, they give no clues about their identity. In a subsequent experiment, however, we found that toxin B abolished the ACh-induced OHC shortening (Fig. 2 A). This result implicates Rho-mediated signaling cascades in this phenomenon and also demonstrates that if other G proteins that can be activated by GTPγS are involved in this signaling cascade, they should be upstream of the Rho GTPases. Subsequently, we tested the participation of individual members of the Rho family of GTPases in the ACh-activated pathway by using the inhibitor molecules dnRac1 and dnCdc42 and the exoenzyme C3 fromC. botulinum (Fig. 2 B). dnRac1 and dnCdc42, individually, abolished the ACh-induced cell shortening, suggesting that this response may be mediated by a signaling cascade involving both Rac1 and Cdc42. In contrast, inhibition of RhoA by C3 enhanced cell shortening (from −0.6 ± 0.1% to −1.1 ± 0.1%). Together, these results demonstrate that RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are crucial components of the molecular machinery that mediates ACh-induced slow motility and suggest that elongation signals mediated by RhoA counterbalance the cell shortening induced by the activation of a Rac1/Cdc42-mediated signaling cascade. To better define the functional interactions between these GTPases in mediating ACh-induced OHC motility, we perfused isolated cells with combinations of inhibitor molecules and measured changes in OHC length (Fig. 2 C). The inhibition of RhoA- and Cdc42-mediated signals by C3 and dnCdc42 resulted in a marked ACh-dependent shortening (−2.2 ± 0.4%) suggesting that Rac1 is a major mediator in this process. We also explored the contribution of Cdc42 to the ACh-induced OHC motility by inhibiting both RhoA and Rac1 using C3 and dnRac1. Under this experimental condition, we did not observe any change in the length of OHC in response to ACh. These data indicate that the participation of Cdc42 in ACh-induced OHC slow motility, detected using the dnCdc42 mutant alone, is not direct but likely mediated by Rac1. Subsequently, the inhibition of Rac1 and Cdc42 by dnRac1 and dnCdc42 was used to define the contribution of RhoA to this phenomenon. Interestingly, we did not observe any response to ACh under this condition. Because our previous observations using C3 alone indicated that RhoA stimulation by ACh should induce OHC elongation (Fig. 2 B), this lack of response to ACh suggests that RhoA may be working either upstream or downstream of Rac1. The described experiments do not permit to distinguish between these two possibilities. Next, we investigated the response to ACh of OHCs internally perfused with the constitutively activated mutants RhoAQL, Rac1QL, or Cdc42QL (Fig. 2 D). We did not observe ACh-induced changes in OHC slow motility in any of these three experimental conditions. These results suggest that the effect of the constant activation of one of the small GTPases may be counterbalanced by the internal activation of one or both of the others. An overstimulation of the full system by ACh should be not enough to shift the response away from equilibrium. Lastly, we measured the response of OHCs co-perfused with inhibitors and activators of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (Fig. 2 E). We found that co-perfusion of dnCdc42 and RhoAQL induced a significant, ACh-dependent OHC elongation (1.3 ± 0.1%) in contrast to the absence of response observed in cells perfused with dnCdc42 or RhoAQL alone. This result further support the existence of a RhoA-mediated signaling pathway that induces OHC elongation and suggests that it may be counterbalanced by a Cdc42-mediated shortening. The inhibition of this ACh-dependent, RhoAQL-mediated elongation by co-perfusion with dnRac1 and RhoAQL, in turn, supports the idea that RhoA-mediated signals may be under Rac1 control, with RhoA upstream of Rac1. Similarly, the shortening observed in cells co-perfused with dnCdc42 and Rac1QL (−0.9 ± 0.1%) and the lack of response to ACh in cells co-perfused with dnRac1 and Cdc42QL confirms the major role of Rac1 in this ACh-induced cell response and suggests that Cdc42 is also working upstream of Rac1. Interestingly, the inhibition of the C3-induced shortening by either Rac1QL or Cdc42QL suggests the existence of a negative feedback mechanism aimed at preventing overstimulation of the signaling pathway (Fig.2 F). Importantly, a similar coordination of signals between RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 has been proposed to explain cytoskeletal reorganization in neuroblastoma, fibroblast, and hematopoietic cells (17Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 33Moorman J.P. Luu D. Wickham J. Bobak D.A. Hahn C.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The effect of ACh on OHC fast motility was investigated using a similar experimental design to that described for slow motility. In this system, the internal perfusion of OHCs with dnRac1 resulted in an increase of 10 ± 1% in the amplitude of fast motility (Fig.3 B). This result suggests that Rac1 controls an ACh-activated pathway aimed at increasing the amplitude of fast motility. The simultaneous inhibition of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 by toxin B, on the other hand, abolished the increase in amplitude induced by the inhibition of Rac1 alone (Fig. 3 A). In consequence, this increase in amplitude must be mediated by RhoA, Cdc42, or both. Therefore, we examined the role of RhoA and Cdc42 in fast motility using C3 and dnCdc42. Interestingly, no ACh-dependent effects on the amplitude of OHC fast motility were detected in cells perfused with either of these inhibitors (Fig.3 B). Thus, these results suggest that the ACh-induced contributions of RhoA or Cdc42 to OHC fast motility are under Rac1 control. We next perfused OHCs with a combination of inhibitor proteins. As shown in Fig. 3 C, ACh increases the amplitude of fast motility by 11 ± 2% in cells co-perfused with dnRac1 and C3. This is similar to the response induced by dnRac1 alone. This result indicates that the increase in amplitude induced by ACh in cells perfused with dnRac1 is not mediated by RhoA but by Cdc42. This conclusion is further supported by the lack of response to ACh of OHCs co-perfused with dnRac1 and dnCdc42. In addition, ACh does not induces any response in cells co-perfused with C3 and dnCdc42, suggesting that Rac1 does not affect directly OHC fast motility. Subsequently, we investigated the response to ACh of OHCs internally perfused with constitutively activated mutants of Rho GTPases. As shown in Fig. 3 D, ACh significantly decreases fast motility amplitude in cells internally perfused with Cdc42QL (−14.6 ± 0.4%). This response can be made compatible with previous results suggesting that Cdc42 mediates the increase in fast motility amplitude, assuming that ACh stimulation induces a RhoA- and Rac1-mediated response aimed at counterbalancing the effect of Cdc42QL. In support of this hypothesis, we have found that internal perfusion of OHCs with Cdc42QL increases fast motility amplitude, independently of ACh, from 3.4 ± 0.2% (Control) to 4.4 ± 0.3% of the total cell length. 2M. Zhang and F. Kalinec, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, ACh should be contributing to the regulation of the system returning fast motility amplitude back to normal levels. In contrast to its effect on Cdc42QL-perfused cells, ACh does not induce significant changes in fast motility amplitude either in RhoAQL- or Rac1QL-perfused cells (Fig.3 D), suggesting that neither Rac1 nor RhoA affect directly OHC fast motility. Finally, we investigated the behavior of OHCs perfused with a combination of inhibitors and activators of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Co-perfusion of Cdc42QL and dnRac1 did not change the ACh-induced increase in the amplitude of fast motility observed in cells perfused with dnRac1 alone (9 ± 2%; compare Fig. 3, B andE). This result may also be described as a dnRac1-mediated inhibition of the regulatory mechanism counterbalancing the effect of Cdc42QL (compare Fig. 3, D and E). Both views are congruent with a model where Cdc42 mediates directly an ACh-induced increase in OHC fast motility, whereas Rac1 is the crucial component of the regulatory mechanism and controls the RhoA-mediated pathway. The proposed roles for Cdc42 and RhoA increasing and decreasing OHC fast motility amplitude, respectively, are further supported by the findings that ACh induces a significant decrease in the amplitude of fast motility in OHCs co-perfused with dnCdc42 and RhoAQL (−10.0 ± 0.3%, Fig. 3 E) but show a lack of effect on cells co-perfused with dnRac1 and RhoAQL. The crucial role of Rac1 is further emphasized by the observed effect of co-perfusing Rac1QL with either C3 or dnCdc42 (Fig. 3 E). Co-perfusion of dnCdc42 and Rac1QL resulted in an ACh-dependent increase in fast motility amplitude (9 ± 1%), whereas co-perfusion of C3 and Rac1QL induces a perceptible (even though not statistically significant) decrease in amplitude. These results suggest that inhibition of Cdc42 induces a Rac1-mediated down-regulation of the pathway that activates RhoA and the simultaneous stimulation of the pathway that activates Cdc42. Conversely, inhibition of RhoA should be able to induce a Rac1-mediated down-regulation of the pathway that activates Cdc42 and the simultaneous stimulation of the pathway that activates RhoA. This hypothesis is further supported by the lack of response to ACh observed in cells co-perfused with C3 and Cdc42QL. Therefore, Rac1 should be working as a master control of the ACh-activated pathway (Fig.3 E). By using specific activators and inhibitors of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, we have revealed the first evidence that modulation of OHC motility by ACh is mediated by Rho GTPases. Our results suggest that Rac1 is a crucial regulator of ACh-induced OHC motility. In cooperation with Cdc42, Rac1 mediates OHC shortening and a simultaneous increase in the amplitude of OHC fast motility. In contrast, in cooperation with RhoA, Rac1 mediates OHC elongation and a decrease in the amplitude of fast motility. Furthermore, these results indicate the existence of a Rac1-controlled feedback mechanism responsible for the fine tuning of OHC fast motility and able to rapidly revert the changes induced by ACh. These processes are essential for maintaining the homeostasis of the cochlear amplifier and thereby for normal hearing. In OHCs, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 co-localize with cytoskeletal structures. Immunolabeling was stronger at the cuticular plate, infracuticular network, and along the lateral wall of OHCs (Fig. 1). The cuticular plate is a dense meshwork of actin and spectrin in the OHC apex, thought to be a stiff nonflexible plate in which the stereocilia are anchored (35Drenckhahn D. Engel K. Höfer D. Merte C. Tilney L. Tilney M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The infracuticular network, in turn, is an expansion of the cuticular plate into the cytoplasm found only in OHCs from the apical end of the guinea pig cochlea (such as those illustrated in Fig.1) (36Raphael Y. Athey B.D. Wang Y. Lee M.K. Altschuler R.A. Hear. Res. 1994; 76: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The OHC lateral wall, on the other hand, is a unique structure composed of three distinct layers: the plasma membrane, the cortical cytoskeleton, and the lateral cisternae (3Holley M.C. Dallos P. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. 8. Springer-Verlag, New York1996: 386-434Google Scholar). The lateral cisternae are multiple, highly ordered layers (as many as twelve in guinea pig) lining up the lateral cytoplasmic surface of OHCs from the apical tight junction to the infranuclear region (37Gulley R.L. Reese T.S. Anat. Rec. 1977; 189: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 38Saito K. Cell Tissue Res. 1983; 229: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Whereas in OHCs the Golgi apparatus is small and confined to a restricted region in the apical, subcuticular area of the cell, specific labeling suggests that lateral cisternae membranes share characteristics of Golgi and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (39Pollice P.A. Brownell W.E. Hear. Res. 1993; 70: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 40Forge A. Zajic G. Li L. Nevill G. Schacht J. Hear. Res. 1993; 64: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This is particularly relevant, because localization analyses in other laboratories have shown association of Cdc42 with Golgi membranes (41Erickson J.W. Zhang C. Kahn R.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26850-26854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 42McCallum S.J. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22537-22544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cortical cytoskeleton, located in the narrow space (∼30 nm wide) between the plasma membrane and the outermost cisternal membrane, is a two-dimensional structure responsible for the shape and most of the mechanical properties of the OHCs (3Holley M.C. Dallos P. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. 8. Springer-Verlag, New York1996: 386-434Google Scholar, 12Holley M.C. Kalinec F. Kachar B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 569-580PubMed Google Scholar). It is composed essentially by roughly circumferential actin filaments up to 1 μm long, cross-linked by shorter (∼50 nm) spectrin tetramers (12Holley M.C. Kalinec F. Kachar B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 569-580PubMed Google Scholar). The actin filaments are connected to the plasma membrane through thousands of 25-nm-long, rod-like structures (pillars) placed about 40 nm from each other (12Holley M.C. Kalinec F. Kachar B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 569-580PubMed Google Scholar, 43Flock A. Flock B. Ulfendahl M. Arch. Otorhinolaryngol. 1986; 243: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 44Raphael Y. Wroblewski R. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. 1986; 18: 731-737PubMed Google Scholar). Even though no changes in the distribution of Rho GTPases or actin were detected in the lateral wall of OHC after stimulation with ACh, Rho-mediated changes in the cortical cytoskeleton remain one of the most attractive candidate mechanisms for the regulation of OHC motility. For instance, subtle biochemical changes in the OHC cortical cytoskeleton may be undetectable by the techniques used in the present work. Future detailed biochemical analyses of this phenomena will likely provide critical insights into the identity of the molecular targets of the Rho GTPases. OHC slow motility is an actin-mediated process. Thus, the putative involvement of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in its regulation should hardly be a surprise. OHC fast motility, on the other hand, is independent of ATP, Ca2+, and, presumptively, of any second messenger-mediated process (3Holley M.C. Dallos P. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. 8. Springer-Verlag, New York1996: 386-434Google Scholar, 7Kachar B. Brownell W.E. Altschuler R. Fex J. Nature. 1986; 322: 365-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 8Holley M.C. Ashmore J.F. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1988; 232: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The motor function is very robust, and neither drugs like cytochalasins, colchicine, and nocodazole nor complete disruption of cytoplasmic structures by internal perfusion of the cells with high concentrations of trypsin, can inhibit it (3Holley M.C. Dallos P. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. 8. Springer-Verlag, New York1996: 386-434Google Scholar, 8Holley M.C. Ashmore J.F. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

However, regulation does not imply inhibition, and OHC fast motility could be regulated without inhibition of the motor function. The mechanical load on the membrane-embedded motor proteins, for instance, could be modulated through changes in number and strength of the thousands of periodically distributed “pillars” that connect the cortical cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane in OHCs. Interestingly, the membrane cytoskeleton linkage through members of the 4.1/Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin protein family seems to be regulated by Rho GTPases (16Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5106) Google Scholar, 45Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 46Girault J.-A. Labesse G. Mornon J.-P. Callebaut I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 54-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and 4.1/Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin proteins have been associated with the pillars in guinea pig OHCs (47Kalinec F. Jaeger R. Kachar B. Duifhuis H. Horst J.W. Dijk P.v. Netten S.M.V. Biophysics of Hair Cell Sensory Systems. World Scientific, Singapore1993: 175-181Google Scholar). In nonauditory cell types, Rho GTPases have been associated with a variety of motile processes such as filopodia, lamellipodia, and stress fiber formation (15Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 16Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5106) Google Scholar). Mature OHCs, however, are terminally differentiated, highly specialized cells that do not migrate, divide, or form these structures. Therefore, it is likely that in OHCs, Rho proteins have adapted to regulate functions that are unique to these cells. The recent report that mutations in known targets of Rho GTPases result in deafness further substantiates this idea. In this regard, our results demonstrate that Rho GTPases are involved in the regulation of OHC motility by ACh, a crucial mechanism for acoustic signal amplification and frequency discrimination in the mammalian inner ear. The role of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in this process, however, may be much more complex than the work models depicted in Figs. 2 F and3 F suggest. For instance, dominant-negative mutants of Rho GTPases inhibit the catalytic domain of Rho-GEFs rather than Rho themselves (28Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Because it has been demonstrated that some of these GEFs may activate more than one Rho family member (48Zheng Y. Hart M.J. Cerione R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 49Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), dominant negative mutants might be interfering with the activation of other components of the family in addition to its normal counterpart, generating a more complex scenario for GTPase interplay. Future studies focused on identifying and characterizing the Rho targets in OHCs will undoubtedly help to refine these models as well as to provide critical insights into the basic mechanisms of both normal human hearing and deafness.

It is an entropically driven, inverse temperature transition caused by the interaction of the hydrophobic domains in the molecule. The coacervate is the favored form of tropoelastin under conditions found in the extracellular matrix (1Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and its water content of 60% is similar to that found in mature elastin (2Urry D.W. Ultrastruct. Pathol. 1983; 4: 227-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When viewed by electron microscopy, coacervates of α-elastin, tropoelastin, and polymeric models of the hydrophobic repeats appear as 5-nm wide, filamentous structures (3Cox B.A. Starcher B.C.

Filaments found in the coacervates of tropoelastin have been shown to associate laterally to form large aggregates with the amorphous appearance typical of tissue elastin (6Bressan G.M.

During elastogenesis, coacervation concentrates and aligns tropoelastin molecules prior to cross-linking by the enzyme lysyl oxidase (7Narayanan A.S. Page R.C. Kuzan F. Cooper C.G. Biochem.

Coacervation results in an increase in the amount of α-helical structure, and it has been suggested that this can be attributed to the alanine-rich cross-linking domains (8Urry D.W. Starcher B.

Coacervation is finely tuned to the conditions of the extracellular matrix, with optimal coacervation occurring at 150 mm NaCl, 37 °C, and pH 7–8 (1Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The coacervation characteristics of polymeric models of the repeat peptides VPGG, VPGVG, and APGVGV have been extensively studied (10Rapaka R.S. Urry D.W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1978; 11: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence is an important factor: poly(VPGG) and poly(VPGVG) coacervate reversibly, whereas poly(APGVGV) precipitates irreversibly (11Urry D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Polymeric models of elastin-like peptides, which lack the PG dipeptide, such as poly(VGGLG), are unable to coacervate (12Tamburro A.M. Guantieri V. Gordini D.D. J. Biomol. Struct.

Dyn. 1992; 10: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Urry D.W. Long M.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1977; 79: 685-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the PG-containing sequences, type II β-turns are formed with PG that are the corners of the bend. Proline stabilizes the β-turns of these domains because its φ angle is fixed at −60°, which is typical for an ideal β-turn (14Debelle L. Tamburro A.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Replacing proline with glycine would increase the flexibility of the molecule and reduce the stability of the β-turn. In tropoelastin, PG-containing hydrophobic repeats are found in the larger hydrophobic domains (up to 55 residues in length) near the center of the molecule, such as those encoded by exons 18, 20, 24, and 26. Proline-depleted hydrophobic domains, such as those encoded by exons 28, 30, and 32, are smaller (20–25 residues). Despite the extensive work done on polymeric models of the hydrophobic repeats, the roles of the individual hydrophobic domains in the native tropoelastin molecule remain unclear. Protease cleavage provides a direct probe of protein conformation, because it relies on direct interactions between the enzyme and individual peptide bonds in its target protein (15Gomes X.V. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5586-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Alonso M.C. van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J. Cross R.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We describe here kallikrein protease mapping of human tropoelastin that explores the surface composition of folded tropoelastin. Recognition of exposed residues is limited to two major sites that flank a 41-amino acid domain encoded by exon 26. We have previously shown that C-terminally truncated forms of tropoelastin, which contained as much as the first 25 domains from the N terminus, displayed deficient coacervation under physiological conditions of salt concentration and temperature (17Wu W.J. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Domain 26 is essential for the association of truncated tropoelastin molecules at 37 °C with a concomitant increase in β-structure. We propose that domain 26 is positioned to play a dominant role in tropoelastin assembly for elastogenesis. SHELΔ26A,1a human tropoelastin isoform lacking the 26A domain, was obtained by overexpression from the plasmid pSHELFΔ26A in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). pSHELFΔ26A was derived from the plasmid pSHELF (18Martin S.L. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 154: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) by deletion of the sequence encoding the 26A domain (19Wu W.J. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21719-21724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The purification method for SHELΔ26A was essentially the same as that described previously for SHEL (1Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), with minor changes to the reverse phase HPLC step. After lyophilizing from 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, the protein was loaded onto a reverse phase column (Delta-Pak C-18, 25 mm x 100 mm, Waters) and eluted along a linear gradient of 30–80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min. SHEL26C and SHEL26(Δ26A)C (Fig. 1 a) consist of domains 26–36 of human tropoelastin. SHEL26(Δ26A)C is identical to SHEL26C except that it lacks the 26A domain. SHEL26C and SHEL26(Δ26A)C were obtained by respective digestion of SHEL and SHELΔ26A with porcine pancreatic kallikrein (EC 3.4.21.35; Sigma). Digestion cleaves human tropoelastin on the C-terminal side of the final arginine residue of domain 25 (Table I). 10 mg/ml solutions of tropoelastin were prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, and porcine pancreatic kallikrein was added to a concentration of 0.1 unit/ml. Digestion was at 37 °C for 2 h. The digests were then loaded onto a reverse phase column (Delta-Pak C-18, 25 mm x 100 mm, Waters) and eluted along a linear gradient of 30–80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. SHEL26(Δ26A)C eluted at 46% acetonitrile and SHEL26C eluted at 44% acetonitrile.Table IN-terminal sequences of kallikrein-produced tropoelastin fragmentsSize1-aSizes of fragments were calculated from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and are approximate.

Open table in a new tab SHEL26.5C was prepared by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-GGA TCC ATC GAA GGT CGT TCC GCC ATG GGA GCT CTG GTA GGC CTG GGC GTA C-3′ and 5′-GCC CAG GCC TAC CAG AGC TCC CAT GGC GGA ACG ACC TTC GAT GGA TCC GTA C-3′ and ligating them into the KpnI site of the plasmid pSHELγ (18Martin S.L. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 154: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The 604-base pair NcoI-BamHI fragment of the resulting construct was excised and inserted into theNcoI-BamHI-digested expression vector pET-3d (20Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pSHELK, was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for expression of SHEL26.5C. Expression and purification conditions for SHEL26.5C were essentially the same as those described above for SHELΔ26A, except that expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm instead of 0.04 mm. The resulting protein has an N terminus corresponding to the central region of domain 26 (Fig. 1 b). The isolated domain 26 peptide was prepared by amplifying the sequence corresponding to human exon 26 from the plasmid pSHELFΔ26A using the primers 5′-GGA TCC GCA GCA GCT GGT CTG-3′ and 5′-GGA TCC TTA AGC ACC GAA ACC CGG-3′. The resulting 138-base pair polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced. The 132-base pair BamHI fragment containing the exon 26 sequence was subsequently excised from this clone and inserted into theBamHI site of the expression vector pGEX-2T (21Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pSHELex26, was expressed in E. coli DH5a cells as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The fusion protein was purified from the soluble fraction of the cells by affinity chromatography using a 10-ml glutathione-agarose column (Sigma). The domain 26 peptide was cleaved from the fusion protein by digestion with bovine thrombin (Sigma) at 37 °C. The released peptide was further purified by reverse phase HPLC using the method described above for SHELΔ26A. Coacervation was measured by monitoring light scattering at 300 nm using a Cary 3 spectrophotometer and software as described previously (1Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Protein samples were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). To determine the maximal rates of coacervation, first derivatives of the time courses of coacervation were obtained. The maximal rate of coacervation was defined as being the maximum slope of the coacervation curve. CD spectra of 100 μm solutions of the domain 26 peptide, in a 0.5-mm cell, were recorded on a Jasco J720 CD spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co. Ltd., Japan) using a Neslab RTE-111 waterbath to control the temperature of the cell. Scans of the peptide in water were obtained between 184 and 260 nm. Increasing amounts of human plasma kallikrein added to SHEL resulted in the production of three major fragments around 45, 22, and 18 kDa as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.2 a). The major bands at 45 and 18 kDa were resistant to further degradation, whereas the 22-kDa fragment eventually disappeared. In the case of SHELΔ26A, the pattern of degradation was somewhat different with the 22- and 18-kDa fragments being replaced by a 15-kDa fragment (Fig. 2 b). N-terminal sequencing of the fragments (Table I) showed that two sites within SHEL were susceptible to cleavage by human plasma kallikrein: the first occurring after Arg515 at the end of domain 25 and the second after Arg564 within domain 26A. The region of tropoelastin between these cleavage sites contains the entire domain 26 sequence (Fig. 2 c). The coacervation profiles of both SHELΔ26A (Fig.3 a) and SHEL26(Δ26A)C (Fig.3 b) were characterized by a lag phase of up to 2 min followed by a period of increasing turbidity and a plateau. No hysteresis was observed in either case as judged by subsequent cooling and heating. Compared with the coacervation profiles of SHEL and SHELΔ26A (1Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 19Wu W.J. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21719-21724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), a more gradual increase in turbidity characterized the coacervation of SHEL26(Δ26A)C. At 37 °C, coacervation of 5 mg/ml SHELΔ26A and SHEL26(Δ26A)C appeared to occur to a similar extent (Fig. 4). However, between 35 and 55 °C, SHEL26(Δ26A)C did not coacervate to the same extent as SHELΔ26A. At some points, the difference in temperatures required for the proteins to reach the same level of coacervation was as much as 10 °C. The difference in the abilities of the two proteins could be explained by the lower number of interacting hydrophobic domains in the smaller molecule, leading to a rise in coacervation temperature.Figure 4Comparison of the coacervation of truncated forms of tropoelastin. Absorbance changes at 300 nm over 10 min were measured for solutions of SHELΔ26A (▪, 5.0 mg/ml), SHEL26(Δ26A)C (▴, 5.0 mg/ml), SHEL26C (♦, 6.2 mg/ml), and SHEL26.5C (●, 8.8 mg/ml). Values were normalized to the level of coacervation of the SHELΔ26A sample at 60 °C and expressed as percentages.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A comparison of the maximal rates for SHEL26(Δ26A)C and SHELΔ26A revealed that the coacervation of SHEL26(Δ26A)C was less favorable kinetically (Fig. 5). The maximal rate for SHELΔ26A was found to increase rapidly over a small temperature interval. SHEL26(Δ26A)C, however, showed less temperature sensitivity, with the maximal rates increasing more gradually with increasing temperature. By 60 °C, the rate for SHEL26(Δ26A)C was only 34% the rate of SHELΔ26A. This effect correlates with a greater level of cooperativity in the coacervation of the full-length molecule because of the presence of additional interacting hydrophobic domains. Domains 26 and 26A are encoded by consecutive exons. For intact tropoelastin isoforms, the temperatures of coacervation are slightly lower for SHELΔ26A than for SHEL (19Wu W.J. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21719-21724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that domain 26A has an inhibitory effect. The effect of domain 26A was further examined by comparing SHEL26C, which contains domain 26A, with SHEL26(Δ26A)C, which lacks 26A (Fig. 4). SHEL26(Δ26A)C coacervated at 35 °C, but this did not proceed to completion until the temperature was ∼60 °C. Coacervation of SHEL26C did not occur at temperatures below ∼45 °C. Temperatures for SHEL26C were at least 10 °C higher than those required to reach the same extent using SHEL26(Δ26A)C, even though the concentration of SHEL26C used in the assay was higher than SHEL26(Δ26A)C. Domain 26A is a hydrophilic domain unique to human tropoelastin and is largely unstructured except for a single β-turn formed around the sequence REGD (22Bisaccia F. Castiglione-Morelli M.A. Spisani S. Ostuni A. Serafini- Fracassini A. Bavoso A. Tamburro A.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11128-11135Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Its effect on coacervation would be more obvious in the shorter fragments of tropoelastin studied here than in the full-length isoforms because it constitutes a larger proportion of the smaller molecule. Domain 26 is the largest hydrophobic domain in SHEL26C and SHEL26(Δ26A)C. SHEL26.5C is identical to SHEL26C, except that it lacks the N-terminal half of domain 26 (Fig.1 b). A comparison of the profiles of SHEL26.5C with those of SHEL26C and SHEL26(Δ26A)C (Fig. 4) showed that disruption of domain 26 disabled coacervation. This indicated a central role for domain 26 in the coacervation of SHEL26C and SHEL26(Δ26A)C and that the hydrophobic domains encoded by exons 28, 30, and 32 did not significantly contribute to the process. Isolated domain 26 peptide did not coacervate, revealing a contextual requirement. Solutions of the peptide, at concentrations up to 4 mg/ml, were examined at temperatures between 30 and 90 °C. As in the cases of full-length tropoelastin (1Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,19Wu W.J. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21719-21724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), coacervation of SHEL26(Δ26A)C was found to be concentration-dependent (Fig. 6). At 2.0 mg/ml, no effect was observed at temperatures below 40 °C, and the extent of coacervation correlated with temperature. At 9.5 mg/ml, coacervation occurred readily between 30 and 35 °C. At this concentration, further increases in temperature caused sharper rises compared with the 2.0 mg/ml sample. Between 46 and 50 °C, coacervation of the 2.0 mg/ml sample rose by 0.50 absorbance units, whereas between 35 and 37 °C, the extent of coacervation of the 9.5 mg/ml sample increased by 0.82 absorbance units. This sharpening of the curves suggested that this was a cooperative process for SHEL26(Δ26A)C. CD spectra of the peptide corresponding to domain 26 (Fig.7 a) revealed that it became more structured with increasing temperature. At 20 °C, the spectrum was characterized by an intense band of −8220 deg cm2dmol−1 at 195 nm, and a less intense band of −620 deg cm2 dmol−1 centered at 227 nm. With increasing temperature, the band at 195 nm changed to −6350 deg cm2dmol−1 at 50 °C, indicating a transition to a more ordered state. The band at 227 nm also changed to −1200 deg cm2 dmol−1 at 50 °C and shifted to 225 nm. An isodichroic point at 206 nm indicated that alterations in the CD spectrum were because of a single conformational transition over the temperature range examined. These changes are consistent with the appearance of β-structure. A temperature scan between 10 and 45 °C, measuring ellipticity at 200 nm, showed that the transition reached a plateau in the approach to 37 °C (Fig. 7 b). The increase in the secondary structure content of the peptide corresponding to domain 26 with increasing temperature could have been because of intra- or intermolecular interactions. To differentiate between these two possibilities, the ellipticities of solutions were measured with peptide concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 μm (not shown). There was no obvious trend in the data to indicate that intermolecular association of domain 26 molecules had occurred. CD spectra in 50% TFE (Fig. 8 a) were used to determine the effect of a nonpolar solvent on the secondary structure of the peptide. Compared with spectra in water, TFE caused a shift of the 195-nm band to 197 nm and altered intensity from −8200 deg cm2 dmol−1 to −3070 deg cm2dmol−1. The band centered at 227 nm changed from −620 deg cm2 dmol−1 to −1260 deg cm2dmol−1. A difference spectrum (Fig. 8 b), obtained by subtracting a water spectrum from a 50% TFE spectrum, indicated that the change was probably because of an increase in β-structure in the peptide in the presence of TFE (23Johnson Jr., W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 24Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). The roles of various hydrophobic repeat sequences, such as VPGG, VPGVG, and APGVGV, have been studied extensively using diverse synthetic models (10Rapaka R.S. Urry D.W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1978; 11: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Urry D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Urry D.W. Long M.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1977; 79: 685-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Polymeric models consisting of the VPGVG and VPGG repeats coacervate, whereas those consisting of APGVGV precipitate irreversibly (10Rapaka R.S. Urry D.W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1978; 11: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proline-depleted sequences lacking the PG dipeptide, such as VGGVG, are unable to coacervate (12Tamburro A.M. Guantieri V. Gordini D.D. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1992; 10: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Urry D.W. Luan C.H. Peng S.Q. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 192: 4-22PubMed Google Scholar) but play an important role in the elasticity of the elastic fiber (14Debelle L. Tamburro A.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Polymers of the human W4 sequence, which corresponds to the domain encoded by exon 18, are elastomeric and are able to coacervate at physiological temperature (26Gowda D.C. Luan C.H. Furner R.L. Peng S.Q. Jing N. Harris C.M. Parker T.M. Urry D.W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1995; 46: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The contextual roles of individual hydrophobic domains in the intact tropoelastin molecule and their associations with other hydrophobic domains are unclear. Protease mapping was used to examine if a specific hydrophobic region is located on the surface of tropoelastin. A preferred candidate for domain mapping in tropoelastin is plasma kallikrein, which is the major serum protease capable of degrading unprotected tropoelastin (27Romero N. Tinker D. Hyde D. Rucker R.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Human tropoelastin was degraded by human plasma kallikrein into discrete bands of 45, 22, and 18 kDa. To map sites precisely, fragments were N-terminally sequenced and assigned to regions of SHEL. One site immediately C-terminal to Arg515 was common to digestion by human serum, human plasma kallikrein, porcine pancreatic kallikrein, and thrombin (data not shown). The second major location cleaved by plasma kallikrein was in 26A as identified by sequencing. Remarkably, these exposed regions in SHEL flank a hydrophobic domain corresponding to that encoded by exon 26. A straightforward interpretation of the data is that the bracketed 41-amino acid domain 26 is exposed on the surface of tropoelastin. Its hydrophobic content precludes cleavage by kallikrein. Domain 26, AAAGLGAGIPGLGVGVGVPGLGVGAGVPGLGVGAGVPGFGA, is marked by four nonapeptide repeats punctuated by Pro residues and describes the longest unit repeat in this molecule (18Martin S.L. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 154: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Polymers of shorter similar structures are capable of association by coacervation because of strong interactions with bulk water (10Rapaka R.S. Urry D.W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1978; 11: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Urry D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Coacervation is an important step in the alignment and incorporation of tropoelastin molecules into the growing elastic fiber where it constitutes the major stage of elastin biosynthesis. We wanted to know if domain 26 plays a dominant role in the coacervation of tropoelastin at 37 °C. As this region is in the C-terminal quarter of the molecule, we examined the coacervation of derivatives of tropoelastin with variable N termini and a shared C terminus. SHEL26C and SHEL26(Δ26A)C consist of domains 26–36 with or without domain 26A. Both forms were found to coacervate. Coacervation of SHEL26(Δ26A)C was less efficient than the coacervation of the full-length tropoelastin isoform SHELΔ26A. Measurements of SHEL26(Δ26A)C coacervation showed that this molecule was less temperature-sensitive than SHELΔ26A, which showed a sharpening of its profile near the transition point. This effect is attributed to a cooperative process during coacervation with the induction of conformational changes. Similar observations were made in studies of α-elastin, poly(VPGG), and poly(VPGVG) (11Urry D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Urry D.W. Long M.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1977; 79: 685-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Kondo M. Nakashima Y. Kodama H. Okamoto K. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In contrast, temperature profiles for the polyhexapeptide poly(APGVGV), which does not coacervate, are characterized by a decrease in transition temperature at increasing concentrations with little or no increase in the steepness of the transition (11Urry D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The concentration dependence seen in the steepness of the coacervation curves of SHEL26(Δ26A)C confirmed the cooperative nature of the interaction. Domain 26A is adjacent to domain 26 but is often spliced out in tropoelastin. SHEL26C and SHEL26(Δ26A)C are identical except for the presence of domain 26A (Fig. 1 a). Comparison of the behavior of SHEL and SHELΔ26A (11Urry D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Wu W.J. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21719-21724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) indicated that the presence of 26A in intact tropoelastin had little effect. Domain 26A is unique to human tropoelastin (29Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Mecham R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1208-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and is unusual in that it contains a large proportion of charged and polar residues compared with other tropoelastin domains. Of the 14 Ser residues in the tropoelastin amino acid sequence, 8 are found within this region (18Martin S.L. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 154: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The unstructured, hydrophilic nature of this domain would be expected to increase the temperature at which coacervation occurs by increasing the hydration of the polypeptide (30Urry D.W. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 11007-11028Crossref Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The observed difference in the performance of SHEL26C and SHEL26(Δ26A)C would have been more obvious than between SHEL and SHELΔ26A because of the larger relative change in size of the smaller molecules. SHEL26C and SHEL26.5C differ by deletion of the first 19 amino acids of domain 26. This was sufficient to abolish coacervation. Preliminary experiments reveal no coacervation for SHEL27C, which consists of domains 27–36 (data not shown). Domain 26 has the longest repeat unit size of any of the repetitive hydrophobic domains of tropoelastin and consists of 4 repeats of the sequenceXGXGXGVPG, where Xis either A, L, V, or I. The formation of type II β-turns at the PG segments would be expected on the basis of structural studies of poly(VPGG), poly(VPGVG), and poly(APGVGV) (11Urry D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Domain 26 may form about 1.5 turns of a loose β-spiral of the type displayed by the polynonapeptide poly(VPGFGVGAG) (25Urry D.W. Luan C.H. Peng S.Q. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 192: 4-22PubMed Google Scholar). Among mammalian tropoelastins, domain 26 is relatively well conserved (31Boyd C.C. Christiano A.M. Pierce R.A. Stolle C.A. Deak S.B. Matrix. 1991; 11: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may have an important role. It is adjacent to cross-linking domain 25, which forms a desmosine cross-link with the lysines of domain 19 (32), in a potential role aligning tropoelastin molecules prior to cross-linking. The lack of coacervation displayed by SHEL26.5C suggests that domain 26 is required for the coacervation of SHEL26C and that the hydrophobic domains encoded by exons 28, 30, and 32 are unlikely to initiate coacervation. These domains are smaller than the central hydrophobic domains, such as those encoded by exons 18, 20, and 24, and lack the regularly repeating proline residues required for the formation of a β-spiral (14Debelle L. Tamburro A.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 33Broch H. Moulabbi M. Vasilescu D. Tamburro A.M. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1998; 15: 1073-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It was not clear whether domains 28, 30, and 32 are involved in intermolecular interactions through a cooperative process after the coacervation of SHEL26C and SHEL26(Δ26A)C is initiated by domain 26. CD spectroscopy of domain 26 revealed a disordered molecule with an increase in structure at elevated temperatures. Similar conformational changes were observed for peptides based on the sequence VPGVG (34Reiersen H. Clarke A.R. Rees A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). CD spectra of β-sheets often display a negative band in the 210–220 nm region and a positive band in the 190–200 nm region of the spectrum (23Johnson Jr., W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 24Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). The temperature-induced transition seen for domain 26 probably represented an increase in β-structure. Measurements of the ellipticity at 200 nm between 10 and 45 °C indicated that the transition reached a plateau at about 37 °C, which supports a model of the importance of domain 26 in coacervation at physiological temperature. Truncated forms of tropoelastin comprising the N-terminal 25 domains of the protein display coacervation only above 37 °C (19Wu W.J. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21719-21724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that one or more of the C-terminal domains are involved in coacervation. In the work presented here, SHEL26(Δ26A)C coacervated readily at 37 °C. In combination with the CD data demonstrating a conformational change in domain 26 by about 37 °C, these results support a model where domain 26 serves an important function in determining the behavior of intact tropoelastin at physiological temperature. Domain 26 should be considered functionally as part of the larger molecules. Isolated domain 26 is unlikely to self-associate as there was no evidence of a concentration-dependent conformational change in our CD data. This lack of self-association was confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation studies on the domain 26 peptide. 2P. Toonkool and A. S. Weiss, unpublished data.TFE was used to determine how the secondary structure of domain 26 may be affected by the hydrophobic environment of the coacervate. TFE induces a conformational change in α-elastin similar to that seen during coacervation (35Starcher B.C. Saccomani G. Urry D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We similarly find that TFE promotes a conformational change to a higher proportion of β-structure. We propose that domain 26 undergoes a temperature-induced conformational change that is enhanced by the hydrophobic environment of the coacervate. During coacervation of SHEL26C and SHEL26(Δ26A)C, interactions between domain 26 and domains 28, 30, and/or 32 may also occur. Domains 19 and 25 have been shown to be involved in the formation of a desmosine cross-link and that the polypeptide chains are aligned in an antiparallel arrangement (32Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Sloan C. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17778-17783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, domain 26 is ideally positioned to allow it to interact hydrophobically with domain 18 in the intact tropoelastin molecule."

SPRK is capable of activating MKK4 by phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, and mutant forms of MKK4 that lack the phosphorylation sites Ser254 and Thr258 block SPRK-induced JNK activation. A region of 63 amino acids following the kinase domain of SPRK is predicted to form a leucine zipper. The leucine zipper domain of SPRK has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for SPRK oligomerization, but its role in regulating activation of SPRK and downstream signaling remains unclear. In this study, we substituted a proposed stabilizing leucine residue in the zipper domain with a helix-disrupting proline to abrogate zipper-mediated SPRK oligomerization. We demonstrate that constitutively activated Cdc42 fully activates this monomeric SPRK mutant in terms of both autophosphorylation and histone phosphorylation activity and induces the same in vivo phosphorylation pattern as wild type SPRK. However, this catalytically active SPRK zipper mutant is unable to activate JNK. Our data show that the monomeric SPRK mutant fails to phosphorylate one of the two activating phosphorylation sites, Thr258, of MKK4. These studies suggest that zipper-mediated SPRK oligomerization is not required for SPRK activation by Cdc42 but instead is critical for proper interaction and phosphorylation of a downstream target, MKK4.

The MAPK pathways regulate many cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression. The best characterized MAPK pathways in mammalian cells are the extracellular signal-regulated kinase, the reactivating kinase (p38/RK), and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways (1Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 2Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). In MAPK pathways, extracellular signals lead to the phosphorylation and activation of a MAPK kinase kinase. An activated MAPK kinase kinase can productively bind, phosphorylate, and, hence, activate a dual specific MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), which in turn activates a MAPK by phosphorylating a threonine residue and a tyrosine residue within the conserved activation segment located between subdomains VII and VIII of its catalytic domain. Activating phosphorylation sites for the MAPKK family have also been identified within kinase subdomains VII and VIII (3Deacon K. Blank J.L. J. Biol.

For instance, the dual specific kinase, MAPK kinase-4 (MKK4/SEK1), which phosphorylates and activates JNK (6Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

Src homology 3 domain-containing proline-rich protein kinase (SPRK), a member of the mixed lineage kinase family (also called MLK-3), has been identified as an upstream activator of the JNK pathway (4Yan M.

SPRK is capable of activating MKK4 by phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, and mutant forms of MKK4 that lack the phosphorylation sites, Ser254 and Thr258, block SPRK-induced JNK activation (7Rana A.

SPRK is an intracellular serine/threonine kinase with a predicted molecular mass of 93 kDa (9Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the kinase domain, the sequence of SPRK encodes several domains that are predicted to be involved in protein-protein interactions, including an Src homology 3 domain, a leucine zipper domain, a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding motif and a COOH-terminal 220-amino acid region that is rich in proline, serine, and threonine residues. Recently, it has been demonstrated that SPRK can associate with an activated form of Cdc42 (10Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 11Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Coexpression of SPRK and activated Cdc42 in cells increases the catalytic activity of SPRK (11Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Interestingly, recombinant catalytically active SPRK is not activated further by the addition of purified GTP-bound Cdc42, suggesting the requirement of an additional cellular component for SPRK activation by Cdc42 (12Böck B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using in vivolabeling experiments and comparative two dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, we have shown that coexpression of SPRK with activated Cdc42 alters the in vivo phosphorylation pattern of SPRK (12Böck B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A region of 63 amino acids following the kinase domain of SPRK is predicted to be a leucine zipper domain. Leucine zippers mediate protein oligomerization by forming coiled coil structures. These structures are stabilized mainly by leucine residues spaced seven residues apart that interact at the interface of opposing helices (13O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 14Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T.

Taneja A.K. Kay C.M. Parker J.M. Mant C.T. Pept. Res. 1988; 1: 19-30PubMed Google Scholar). The heptad repeat is the name given to the notation of labeling the amino acids in the leucine zipper domain, athrough g, with leucine residues predominately found at position d (17Hodges R.S. Saund A.K. Chong P.C. St.-Pierre S.A. Reid R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1214-1224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, electrostatic interactions in the form of salt bridges may also contribute to coiled coil stability and specificity (18O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 699-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 19Hu J.C. Newell N.E. Tidor B. Sauer R.T. Protein. Sci. 1993; 2: 1072-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The leucine zipper domain of SPRK is necessary and sufficient to mediate homo-oligomerization (12Böck B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Based on deletion studies, others have suggested that zipper-mediated SPRK oligomerization is required for its activation (20Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We have examined the role of the leucine zipper of SPRK in more detail and arrive at a different conclusion. Rather than deleting the entire leucine zipper, we substituted a helix-disrupting proline for a leucine residue at one of the proposed d positions in the zipper motif of SPRK. Although this point mutant fails to oligomerize, constitutively activated Cdc42 fully activates this monomeric SPRK mutant in terms of both autophosphorylation and histone phosphorylation activity. Moreover, Cdc42 induces the same in vivo phosphorylation pattern of the SPRK zipper mutant and wild type SPRK. However, this catalytically active SPRK zipper mutant is unable to activate JNK. Our data show that SPRK oligomerization is necessary to phosphorylate Thr258, one of the two activating phosphorylation sites of MKK4. These studies suggest that zipper-mediated SPRK oligomerization is not required for the activation of SPRK by Cdc42 but is required for proper interaction and phosphorylation of a downstream target, MKK4. Construction of the cytomegalovirus-based expression vectors carrying the cDNAs for wild type SPRK (pRK5-sprk) has been described elsewhere (9Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression plasmid encoding NH2-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged constitutively active variant (pRK5-Nflag.cdc42 Val-12) of Cdc42 was kindly provided by Avi Ashkenazi (Genentech, Inc.). A variant of SPRK containing a point mutation in the leucine zipper domain (SPRK L410P) was constructed using the Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA.), with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CTTTTCCTTGGCTCGCGGCTCGTCGAAGAGACC-3′ and 5′-GGTCTCTTCGACGAGCCGCGAGCCAAGGAAAAG-3′. The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing using Sequenase enzyme (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the Sanger method. Construction of the COOH-terminal triple hemagglutinin (3HA) epitope-tagged variant (pRK5-C3HA.sprk) was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 3HA epitope from the CLN2T plasmid (21Tyers M. Tokiwa G. Nash R. Futcher B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1773-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CGTGAGGTACCGGAAGCGGGGCCTTACCCATACGATGTTCC-3′ and 5′-CGAGGTCTAGATTAGCACTGAGCAGCGTAATCTGG-3′, followed by subcloning of the amplified fragment into the pRK5-sprk vector usingNheI and XbaI. Dr. Ajay Rana (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) kindly provided the pEBG-sek/mkk4 expression plasmid encoding murine MKK4 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). Human fetal kidney 293 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium/low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mmglutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmids (10 μg each for 100-mm dishes) were used to transfect 293 cells using the calcium phosphate technique. Cell monolayers were incubated with the DNA precipitate for 4 h, then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured in the medium described above. Cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed as described previously (12Böck B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The following antibodies against the proteins of interest were prebound to protein A-agarose beads: SPRK antiserum (0.25 μg/μl slurry), M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak IBI) directed against the FLAG epitope (0.45 μg/μl slurry) and JNK C-17 antibody (Santa Cruz) (50 ng/μl slurry). Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously (9Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the GST pulldown experiment, 293 cells were transiently cotransfected with pEBG-sek/mkk4 or pEBG and expression vectors for SPRK variants. Clarified lysate (300 μl) was incubated with 20 μl of antibody bound protein A-agarose or 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose resin for 90 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates and the GST pulldowns were washed with HNTG buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). Immunoprecipitates used for kinase assays were washed three times with HNTG buffer containing 1 m LiCl, three times with HNTG buffer, and twice with kinase assay buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmMnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates and immunoprecipitates of proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted using SPRK antiserum (1 μg/ml), 16B12 HA monoclonal antibody (BabCo) (5 μg/ml), M2 FLAG monoclonal antibody (9 μg/ml), JNK C-17 antibody (0.5 μg/ml), MKK4 antibody (0.5 μg/ml), or phospo-MKK4 antibody (New England Biolabs) (0.5 μg/ml), followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.). Western blots were developed by chemiluminescence. Multiple exposures of the Western blots were developed, and densitometry (NIH Image) of unsaturated films was used to determine relative expression levels. Statistics were calculated using an unpaired Student's t test. A p value smaller that 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Kinase assays were performed in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). For the SPRK kinase assay 10 μg of mixed histones (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or 10 μg of murine GST-MKK4 was used as the substrate, and the reaction was carried out for 30 min at room temperature. GST-MKK4 was expressed from the pGEX-2T vector in Escherichia coli BL-21 cells and purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography. The reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) containing 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. JNK assays were performed as described previously, using GST-c-Jun as the substrate (12Böck B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The pGEX-c-jun () vector was kindly provided by Dr. Ajay Rana (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). GST-c-Jun was expressed in E. coli XL-1 Blue cells and purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography. Following the kinase assay, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, dried, and incorporation of radioactivity into kinase or substrates was determined by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). MBP fusion protein plasmid construction and protein expression were described previously (12Böck B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). MBP fusion proteins were purified by amylose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fractions containing the MBP-zips or MBP-zips L410P, as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, were pooled and concentrated to about 1 mg/ml using a Centriprep concentrator (Amicon). Gel filtration fast pressure liquid chromatography was used to analyze MBP-zips and MBP-zips L410P. The fusion proteins were applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (25 ml column volume) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The void volume of the column was determined using blue dextran (2000 kDa). The column was calibrated with cytochrome c (12 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), amylase (200 kDa), apoferritin (445 kDa), and thyroglobulin (700 kDa) (Sigma). The fusion proteins were eluted with 250 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 125 mm NaCl at room temperature. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the effluent was continuously monitored at 280 nm. Approximately 30 fractions of 1.0 ml each were collected, and the presence of MBP fusion proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. After a 24-h transfection with pRK5-sprk or pRK5-sprk L410P in the presence or absence of pRK5-Nflag.Cdc42Val-12, 293 cells were washed five times with phosphate-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were then incubated in phosphate-free medium containing 3 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products) for 4 h at 37 °C. Lysis and subsequent tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of labeled cells have been described in detail elsewhere (12Böck B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Following an in vitrokinase assay in which 10 μg of GST-MKK4 was used as a substrate, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Radiolabeled MKK4 bands were excised from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After washing three times with methanol and three times with water, the radioactive piece of membrane was incubated in 200 μl of 6 n HCl for 1 h at 100 °C. The hydrolyzed phosphoamino acids were concentrated in a SpeedVac. Unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards (Sigma) and xylene cyanol FF marker dye (Sigma) were added to each sample. The phosphoamino acids were separated by one-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis in pH 2.5 buffer (66.7% pH 3.5 buffer (glacial acetic acid/pyridine/water, 50:5:945 v/v/v) and 33.3% pH 1.9 buffer on 20 × 20 cm cellulose TLC plates at 0 °C and 500 V for 1.5 h. The unlabeled phosphoamino acids were visualized by ninhydrin staining, and the 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were visualized and quantitated by phosphorimaging. Previous studies have shown that SPRK with an intact zipper domain can self-associate and that large deletions in the zipper domain compromise the autophosphorylation activity of SPRK and abrogate its ability to activate JNK (12Böck B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To more carefully probe the function of the zipper domain of SPRK, a leucine residue at position 410, which is predicted to reside at a coiled coil interface (23Lupas A. Methods. Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was substituted with a proline residue using site-directed mutagenesis. The catalytic properties of this zipper mutant, SPRK L410P, were compared with those of wild type SPRK. Cells transiently expressing SPRK or SPRK L410P were lysed, and the SPRK proteins were immunoprecipitated and used in an in vitro kinase assay with a mixture of histones as a substrate. Data from a representative experiment are shown in Fig.1 A. Based on three independent experiments, SPRK L410P has 35% of the autophosphorylation activity and 30% of the histone phosphorylation activity of wild type SPRK. Although expression of wild type SPRK activates JNK in 293 cells, SPRK L410P fails to induce JNK activation (Fig. 1 B). These data suggest that the zipper domain of SPRK is important for its basal phosphorylation activity and for JNK activation. Leucine zipper domains commonly dimerize or form higher order oligomers. To test whether SPRK L410P in the context of its zipper domain can oligomerize, fusion proteins consisting of the monomeric MBP fromE. coli, and either the leucine zipper domain of wild type SPRK (MBP-zips) or that containing the proline mutation (MBP-zips L410P) were constructed and analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2 A). MBP-zips elutes as a high molecular mass complex corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 300 kDa. However, MBP-zips L410P elutes predominantly as a single peak corresponding to a molecular mass of about 55 kDa, the expected size for the monomeric protein. These data demonstrate that the leucine zipper domain of SPRK is capable of forming multimers of MBP and that a point mutation of one leucine residue is sufficient to disrupt the oligomerization of the leucine zipper domain of SPRK. To examine whether the zipper point mutation effects association with full-length SPRK, we examined whether SPRK L410P or wild type SPRK could associate with epitope-tagged SPRK. After transient coexpression of SPRK L410P or wild type SPRK, with HA-tagged SPRK (3HA-SPRK), cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with the HA antibody. The presence of associated untagged SPRK or SPRK L410P was assessed by Western blotting with a SPRK antibody (Fig. 2 B). The triple HA epitope adds 27 amino acids to the COOH terminus of SPRK, allowing it to be distinguished from untagged SPRK by its slower mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Although wild type SPRK associates with 3HA-SPRK, SPRK L410P cannot form a detectable complex with 3HA-SPRK. These results, coupled with the gel filtration experiments, indicate that SPRK L410P behaves as a monomer. The GTPase Cdc42 in its active form can associate with SPRK and increase its catalytic activity (11Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 12Böck B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This increased activity measured in vitro correlates with a change in the in vivo phosphorylation state of SPRK (12Böck B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of Cdc42Val-12, a mutant form of the GTPase that renders Cdc42 constitutively active, on the activity of SPRK L410P in an immunocomplex kinase assay. SPRK or SPRK L410P, expressed in the presence or absence of Cdc42Val-12, was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates of transiently transfected 293 cells and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using a mixture of histones as a substrate. After coexpression with Cdc42Val-12, the in vitro autophosphorylation and histone phosphorylation activities of SPRK L410P are the same as those of wild type SPRK coexpressed with Cdc42Val-12 (Fig.3, A, C, andD). To test the ability of the leucine zipper mutant to associate with activated Cdc42, SPRK L410P or wild type SPRK was coexpressed with FLAG-tagged Cdc42Val-12 in 293 cells. As shown in Fig.3 B, SPRK L410P coimmunoprecipitated with Cdc42Val-12, although to a lesser extent than did wild type SPRK. These data suggest that SPRK L410P can bind and be fully activated by Cdc42Val-12. Because coexpression with Cdc42Val-12renders SPRK L410P fully active in in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 3, A, C, and D), we tested whether this zipper mutant, when coexpressed with the GTPase, was competent in downstream signaling. Cells expressing SPRK or SPRK L410P, in the presence or absence of Cdc42Val-12, were lysed, and the activity of endogenous JNK was measured in an immune complexin vitro kinase assay using GST-c-Jun as a substrate. Wild type SPRK, upon overexpression, activates JNK (Fig.4, A and B,lane 2); Cdc42Val-12 expressed alone moderately activates JNK (lane 4). Coexpression of Cdc42Val-12 with SPRK further increases JNK activity (lane 5). However, SPRK L410P coexpressed with activated Cdc42 exhibits no increase in JNK activation over that of Cdc42Val-12 alone (lanes 4 and 6). Thus, SPRK L410P, when coexpressed with Cdc42Val-12, fails to activate endogenous JNK even though under these conditions it exhibits wild type phosphotransfer activity in vitro. These findings suggest a role for leucine zipper-mediated SPRK oligomerization in downstream signaling events. We recently reported that coexpression with Cdc42Val-12 induces a differential phosphorylation pattern of SPRK in vivo (12Böck B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of activated Cdc42 on the phosphorylation state of SPRK L410P in vivo, comparative two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide analyses of SPRK and SPRK L410P labeled in vivo, in the absence or in the presence of Cdc42Val-12, were performed. As shown in Fig.5, in the absence of Cdc42Val-12, SPRK and SPRK L410P have similar phosphopeptide patterns. Cdc42Val-12 induces a differentialin vivo phosphorylation state of both SPRK and SPRK L410P, and the phosphopeptide patterns are alike. The two new phosphopeptides observed after coexpression of Cdc42Val-12 with SPRK, and with SPRK L410P, are indicated by arrows in the lower panels of Fig. 5. These data strongly suggest that both SPRK and SPRK L410P undergo the same changes in phosphorylation upon coexpression with Cdc42Val-12. Furthermore, these changes in in vivo phosphorylation correlate with the increasedin vitro catalytic activity of both SPRK and SPRK L410P (Fig. 3). Coexpression with Cdc42Val-12 yields a fully active SPRK L410P as judged by in vitro catalytic activity (Fig. 3), yet SPRK L410P, even when coexpressed with Cdc42Val-12, fails to activate JNK (Fig. 4). To explore these disparate findings we examined whether SPRK L410P might be defective in phosphorylating an established physiological substrate, MKK4, which can directly phosphorylate and activate JNK. MKK4 was expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion and purified using a glutathione-Sepharose column. Primary data from an in vitr"

This is believed to require phosphorylation with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), although the mechanism by which PKA inhibits Raf is controversial. We investigated the requirement for PKA phosphorylation using Raf mutants expressed in HEK293 or NIH 3T3 cells. Phosphopeptide mapping of 32P-labeled Raf (WT) or a mutant lacking a putative PKA phosphorylation site (serine to alanine, S43A) confirmed that serine 43 (Ser43) was the major cAMP (forskolin)-stimulated phosphorylation site in vivo. Interestingly, the EGF-stimulated Raf kinase activity of the S43A mutant was inhibited by forskolin equivalently to that of the WT Raf. Forskolin also inhibited the activation of an N-terminal deletion mutant Δ5–50 Raf completely lacking this phosphorylation site. Although WT Raf was phosphorylated by PKA, phosphorylation did not inhibit Raf catalytic activity in vitro, nor did forskolin treatment inhibit the activity of an N-terminally truncated Raf protein (Raf 22W) or a full-length Raf protein (Raf-CAAX) expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. In contrast, forskolin inhibited the EGF-dependent activation of a Raf isoform (B-Raf), lacking an analogous phosphorylation site to Ser43. Thus, these results demonstrate that PKA exerts its inhibitory effects independently of direct Raf phosphorylation and suggests instead that PKA prevents an event required for the EGF-dependent activation of Raf.

Lawrence J.C.J. Trends Endocrinol. 1996; 7: 43-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect requires activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (20Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence J.C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Instead, considerable effort has focused on the serine/threonine kinase c-Raf-1 (c-Raf) as the target of inhibition, and c-Raf is consistently inhibited in cells after elevation of cAMP. PKA phosphorylates substrates containing tandem basic residues upstream of a phosphorylatable serine or threonine residue (24Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar).Although this model has been widely accepted, the requirement for Ser43 phosphorylation has not been directly tested in vivo, and alternative models have been proposed. The studies of Kolch and co-workers (27Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell.

However, this hypothesis has been difficult to test because the autophosphorylation of Ser621 is required for Raf kinase activity (5Thorson J.A., Yu, L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W.

However, in comparison with the consistent inhibition found with c-Raf, the influence of cAMP on the related enzyme B-Raf is more complex. There are examples of inhibition (29Vaillancourt R.R.

B-Raf lacks an analogous Ser43 phosphorylation as found in c-Raf but does contain a similar Ser621 phosphorylation site (35Sithanandam G. Kolch W. Duh F.M. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1775-1780PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to some of the studies on c-Raf (27Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13193-13197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The third Raf isoform, A-Raf, is not widely expressed in cells and may be resistant to the inhibitory effects of cAMP (36Bogoyevitch M.A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).The fact that no single consensus model appears sufficient to explain the regulation of Raf (c- or B-Raf) has led to the search for other targets. The Rap proteins (Rap 1a/b) are phosphorylated by PKA (37Siess W. Winegar D.A. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), can bind Raf, and block Ras signaling when overexpressed in cells (38Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, these proteins were originally proposed to be candidates for mediating the cAMP-dependent inhibition of Raf. However, recent studies suggest that Rap is not required for inhibition of MAPK signaling (40Zwartkruis F.J. Wolthuis R.M. Nabben N.M. Franke B. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that Rap 1b is activated by cAMP (41Altschuler D.L. Peterson S.N. Ostrowski M.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10373-10376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This appears to occur independently of the action of PKA (42Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar) and may play a mitogenic role (43Altschuler D.L. Ribeiro-Neto F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) through the cAMP-dependent activation of B-Raf (31Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar).Hence, the studies described herein were designed to resolve some of the remaining questions concerning Raf regulation by cAMP. Importantly, we find that deletion of the major PKA phosphorylation site (Ser43) does not impede the cAMP-dependent inhibition of Raf in vivo. Furthermore, we find no evidence for a cAMP-stimulated increase in the phosphorylation of Ser621 in vivo or a direct inhibitory effect of PKA on Raf either in vitro or on constitutively activated Raf kinases (Raf 22W, Raf-CAAX) expressed in vivo. Finally, examination of an alternative isoform (B-Raf) lacking an analogous Ser43 phosphorylation site demonstrated that forskolin prevented the EGF-dependent activation of this enzyme, consistent with PKA interrupting an event required for Raf activation rather than inhibiting Raf itself.DISCUSSIONInhibition of the MAPK cascade by cAMP and the consequential activation of PKA is a widely observed phenomenon in many different cell types (19Graves L.M. Lawrence J.C.J. Trends Endocrinol. 1996; 7: 43-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, despite this observation, the mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood and remains controversial. Of particular interest is whether phosphorylation of Raf is required to explain the inhibition of this kinase in vivo. Previous studies have suggested that phosphorylation of Ser43 is required for Raf inhibition (22Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5318-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); however, a direct test of this hypothesis has not been performed in vivo. By examining two different mutants of Raf (S43A or Δ5–50 Raf), our studies now clearly demonstrate that deletion of this region of Raf is dispensable for normal activation by EGF or for inhibition by cAMP. This is consistent with studies showing that the primary Ras binding domain of Raf includes amino acids 51–131 (see Ref. 12Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar and references therein) and would imply that Ser43 is outside the region required for Raf/Ras binding in vivo. These conclusions are further supported by our findings with B-Raf showing that cAMP inhibits activation of a related isoform lacking an analogous Ser43phosphorylation site. Although our phosphopeptide mapping results confirm that Ser43 is the major site of cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation in c-Raf in vivo (26Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the finding that removing Ser43 does not affect Raf regulation indicates that phosphorylation of this site remains an enigma.Previously it was suggested that phosphorylation of Raf on Ser621 was responsible for inhibition of c-Raf kinasein vivo (28Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although the authors demonstrated that PKA phosphorylated Raf on Ser621 in vitro, evidence for the forskolin or cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser621 in vivo was not presented. In our phosphopeptide mapping studies, we observed two constitutively phosphorylated peptides in Raf, one of which co-migrated with the synthetic Ser621 tryptic peptide, whereas the other most likely corresponds to the Ser259 autophosphorylation peptide as shown earlier (26Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found no evidence for increased phosphorylation of Ser621 in response to forskolin treatment of cells. Instead, this peptide was phosphorylated equally in both untreated and forskolin-treated cells, consistent with this amino acid being a major autophosphorylation site in vivo (26Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and arguing against Ser621 as a valid PKA phosphorylation sitein vivo. In addition, compared with the Ser43peptide, the Ser621 peptide lacks the optimal pair of basic residues (RSAS) and is a poor substrate for PKAin vitro. Phosphorylation of the Ser621 peptide occurred at a rate approximately 100 times lower than that observed with the Ser43 peptide in vitro. 2M. Sidovar, unpublished observations. Instead, Ser621 is efficiently phosphorylated by the AMP-activated protein kinase (50Sprenkle A.B. Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In other studies, phosphorylation of Ser621 has been shown to be required for both 14-3-3 binding and Raf activity (5Thorson J.A., Yu, L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Hence, it seems unlikely that a phosphorylation site that is essential for Raf activity would also be required for inhibition as suggested by Kolch and co-workers (28Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These observations combined with our in vivo phosphopeptide mapping studies strongly suggest that phosphorylation of Ser621 does not mediate the cAMP-dependent inhibition of Raf kinase in vivo.Although our data demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser43 was not required for the inhibition of Raf kinasein vivo, PKA might still prevent Raf/Ras association at the plasma membrane as suggested earlier (22Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Our experiments with Raf-CAAX were designed to test this hypothesis, and, consistent with this model, we find that this protein is completely resistant to inhibition by cAMP. Although these results may argue that the primary effect of PKA is to disrupt Ras/Raf association, there are other potential interpretations of these results. For instance, once activated, Raf may be resistant to the effects of PKA. Our results with the PKA phosphorylation of active Raf in vitro or forskolin treatment of the Raf 22W cells would support this model. Using either the baculovirus-expressed Raf, the EGF-activated WT, or S43A Raf from HEK cells, the truncated and active form of Raf expressed in NIH 3T3 cells or Raf-CAAX, we found no evidence for the direct inhibition of Raf kinase by PKA either in vitro or in vivo. In this regard, our results are in agreement with the studies of Whitehurst et al. (51Whitehurst C.E. Owaki H. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Geppert T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5594-5599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that the catalytic subunit of c-Raf is not directly inhibited by PKA.Instead, our findings would be consistent with cAMP inhibiting an event required for the activation of both B- and c-Raf. This hypothesis would be in agreement with earlier studies showing that cAMP inhibited the Ras-dependent activation of B-Raf (29Vaillancourt R.R. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6522-6530Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Peraldi P. Frodin M. Barnier J.V. Calleja V. Scimeca J.C. Filloux C. Calothy G. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and would be supported by our results demonstrating that forskolin prevents the EGF-dependent activation of both B- and c-Raf in GN4 cells. The lack of effect of forskolin on the basal activity of either B- or c-Raf in GN4 cells reiterates our findings showing that PKA does not directly inhibit the catalytic activity of Raf. Because the catalytic regions of both B-Raf and c-Raf are highly homologous (35Sithanandam G. Kolch W. Duh F.M. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1775-1780PubMed Google Scholar) and because other recent studies have found that B-Raf is resistant to inhibition by PKA (32MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13193-13197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we believe argues against a direct effect of PKA on the catalytic domain of Raf. Although these authors (32MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13193-13197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) did see a partial inhibitory effect of PKA on c-Raf (less than 50%), we do not believe that this incomplete effect accounts for the greater than 90% inhibition of c-Raf activity that we observed in vivo.Additional targets that were not investigated in this study include the Rap proteins. Although these proteins are phosphorylated by PKAin vivo (37Siess W. Winegar D.A. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and can physically antagonize the binding of c-Raf to Ras (52Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), the most recent studies suggest that PKA phosphorylation may diminish the inhibitory potential of these proteins (53Hu C.D. Kariya K. Okada T. Qi X. Song C. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 48-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, considerable evidence suggests that cAMP-dependent activation of Rap results in the activation of B-Raf (43Altschuler D.L. Ribeiro-Neto F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (31Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Although we did not observe a stimulatory effect of cAMP on B-Raf in the GN4 cells, 3J. W. Lee, unpublished observations. this may be explained by cell type differences in the expression of Rap as described by others (34Dugan L.L. Kim J.S. Zhang Y. Bart R.D. Sun Y. Holtzman D.M. Gutmann D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25842-25848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings, combined with the recent studies showing that Rap is not required for the inhibition of MAPK signaling (40Zwartkruis F.J. Wolthuis R.M. Nabben N.M. Franke B. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), suggest that Rap proteins do not mediate the inhibition of Raf observed in our studies.So what might explain the inhibitory effects of cAMP on Raf? Recent studies have shown that PAK3 can function as a Raf kinase, thus contributing to the activation of Raf by growth factors and other stimuli (10King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 54Diaz B. Barnard D. Filson A. Macdonald S. King A. Marshall M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, studies from Howe et al. 4Howe, A. K., and Juliano, R. L. (2000)Nat. Cell Biol., in press. show that PAK contains a consensus PKA phosphorylation site and find that PAK is phosphorylated and inhibited in response to forskolin treatment of cells. This observation would be consistent with our findings suggesting that PKA phosphorylation of Raf itself is insufficient to explain the inhibition observed in vivo; however, whether or not the phosphorylation of PAK by PKA is required to account for this regulation remains to be established. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 cascade is a conserved phosphorylation pathway involved in the transduction of growth and differentiation signals in both simple and complex organisms (reviewed in Ref. 1Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the now established paradigm, peptide growth factors bind to their receptor tyrosine kinases, increasing intracellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation and stimulating the exchange of GDP for GTP in small GTP-binding proteins such as Ras (reviewed in Ref. 2Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Raf, a 74-kDa serine/threonine kinase, binds to Ras-GTP at the plasma membrane, thus providing an integral link between the receptor-mediated events and activation of the MAPK cascade (3Van Aelst L.

It is activated by Ca2+ and/or by caspase-3 cleavage to release the Ca2+-insensitive N-terminal half (N-half)1 (3Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J.

The involvement of gelsolin in cytoskeletal destruction during apoptosis highlights the importance of clamping it in the inactive state and regulating its activity stringently to achieve controlled severing in nonapoptotic cells. This paper seeks to understand how gelsolin is prevented from severing actin filaments and how it is activated by Ca2+. Gelsolin has six homologous domains (segments (S) 1–6) which are separated into the N-half (S1–3) and the C-terminal (C)-half (S4–6) by a long linker (4Kwiatkowski D.P. Stossel T.P. Orkin S.H. Mole J.E. Colten H.R. Yin H.L Nature. 1986; 323: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The N-half severs actin filaments (5Chaponnier C. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L J.

Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.-G. Weeds A.G. A Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The N-half severs in exceedingly low Ca2+, whereas the C-half binding to actin requires 10−6m Ca2+ (5Chaponnier C. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1473-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Bryan J J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Biochemical and biophysical studies suggest that Ca2+ opens up gelsolin by inducing a conformational change in the C-half (10Kwiatkowski D. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 11Patkowski A. Seils J. Hinssen H. Dorfmuller TH Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 427-435Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to expose actin-binding sites on the N-half. Thus, the C-half acts as a regulatory domain to impose Ca2+ regulation on the N-half. Remarkably, deletion of just 23 residues (Phe733–Ala755) (see Fig.1 A) from the C terminus allows gelsolin to sever in the absence of Ca2+ (in EGTA) (10Kwiatkowski D. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These results provide the first indication that the gelsolin C terminus has a major role in transmitting Ca2+ regulation from the C-half to the N-half. The three-dimensional crystal structure of gelsolin in the absence of Ca2+ (i.e. in EGTA) (12Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) shows that these residues are part of the S6 tail (Phe732–Ala755). The tail contains a proximal unstructured strand (which will be referred to as the tail loop) that is capped at the C terminus by a short helix (Pro744–Ala754). The S6 tail helix is closely aligned with the S2 actin-binding helix (12Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, the tail helix may act as a latch to block S2 from binding to actin. We will refer to this potential mode of regulation as the “tail helix latch” mechanism. The importance of S6 in maintaining the inactive gelsolin conformation is further supported by the finding that isolated S1 associates with S2–6 but not with S2–5 in EGTA (13Pope B.J. Gooch J.T. Weeds A.G Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15848-15855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). S6 therefore appears to be important in maintaining S1 association with the rest of the molecule in EGTA, and Ca2+ destabilizes this association. However, because S6 makes multiple contacts with the N-half in addition to latching onto the S2 helix (12Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), the role of the tail helix latch on Ca2+ regulation is not established conclusively. In addition, although there is general agreement that gelsolin is activated by Ca2+, how much Ca2+ is required is still disputed. Initial studies show that cytoplasmic and naturally occurring plasma gelsolin bind two Ca2+ with 10−6m K d and is activated by 10−6m Ca2+ to sever actin filaments (14Yin H.L. Hartwig J.H. Maruyama K. Stossel T.P J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9693-9697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Weeds A.G. Gooch J. Pope B. Harris H.E Eur. J.

Subsequent studies find that gelsolin interactions with Ca2+ may be more complex than initially anticipated. Isolated recombinant plasma gelsolin domains have at least three Ca2+-binding sites, two with K d of 0.2 × 10−6m and one withK d of 2 × 10−6m (17Way M. Gooch J. Pope B. Weeds A.G J.

Binding to actin generates additional intermolecular and intramolecular sites (9McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.-G. Weeds A.G. A Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 16Bryan J. Kurth M.C J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7480-7487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Robinson R.C.

It is not known which of these Ca2+-binding sites are functionally significant. Unexpectedly, although gelsolin undergoes a conformational change at submicromolar Ca2+ (13Pope B.J. Gooch J.T.

J. 1998; 75: 3092-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), severing by gelsolin requires 10−5m Ca2+ at room temperature (20Kinosian H.J. Newman J. Lincoln B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8999-9004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that the high apparent requirement for severing is artifactual because the rate of severing is slow, and most severing assays are not carried out at equilibrium (20Kinosian H.J.

In this paper, we tested the tail helix latch hypothesis and examined the structural basis and physiological relevance of Ca2+regulation of gelsolin. We found that Ca2+ induces structural rearrangements that are reflected in a three-step change in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of gelsolin. A major component of these changes occurs at 10−6mCa2+ when the gelsolin S6 distal tail helix is unlatched from the gelsolin N-half. In addition, we uncovered a role for another part of the S6 tail, the proximal tail loop, in the Ca2+regulation of the gelsolin C-half. This study provides the first biochemical support for the tail latch hypothesis (12Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J.

The tail deleted constructs GS744, GS738, and GS732 were generated by using polymerase chain reaction to create fragments starting from gelsolin coding sequence nucleotide 1522 and ending with a termination codon in tandem with a HindIII site at the desired 3′ position of the gelsolin cDNA. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into pGEMT-easy vector (Promega). The constructs were digested with SmaI (gelsolin coding nucleotide 1648) and HindIII. These fragments were used to replace the wild type SmaI-HindIII cassette in full-length gelsolin in pet21a. The C-terminal half expression vector (encompassing gelsolin residues 407–755) was described in Lin et al. (23Lin K.-M. Wenegieme E.F. Lu P.-J. Chen C.-S. Yin H.L J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20443-20450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). C-terminal truncations were generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned in pet21a. All constructs were sequenced and found to have no artifactual mutations. Recombinant proteins were expressed in bacteria, lysed in 1 mm dithiothreitol and 5 mm EGTA, and purified by sequential anion and cation exchange chromatography (24Yu F.-X. Zhou D. Yin H.L J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19269-19275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were dialyzed against 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl and 1 mm EGTA and stored at −70 °C in small aliquots. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring cytoplasmic gelsolin and most bacterially expressed recombinant gelsolins are not disulfide-bonded between Cys188 and Cys201, although naturally occurring plasma gelsolin is (12Burtnick L.D.

Our recombinant gelsolin was in the reduced form (non-disulfide-bonded) as isolated from Escherichia coli. It was oxidized by incubation with 2 mm oxidized glutathione (Sigma) at 24 °C in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, and 1 mm EGTA for 20 min (26Wen D. Corina K. Chow E.P. Miller S. Janmey P.A. Pepinsky R.B Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9700-9709Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Oxidation was confirmed by a change in proteolytic profile (see Fig. 2) consistent with that described in Wen et al. (26Wen D. Corina K. Chow E.P. Miller S. Janmey P.A. Pepinsky R.B Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9700-9709Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Severing was measured by following the decrease in pyrene actin fluorescence as filaments (F-actin) depolymerize after dilution (10Kwiatkowski D. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Rabbit muscle actin labeled withN-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was mixed with unlabeled actin at a 1:2 molar ratio and polymerized overnight at 4.8 × 10−6m(unlabeled actin) in buffer B (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). F-actin was diluted to 1.6 × 10−7m with buffer B containing 0.4 mm EGTA/CaCl2 and gelsolin. The sample was vortexed gently, and recording was started immediately after mixing. The change in fluorescence intensity was monitored in a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The difference in the slope of the fluorescence curves with and without gelsolin is defined as the rate of severing and is expressed as a percentage of that observed at 8.7 × 10−5m Ca2+. Free Ca2+ concentrations were estimated using a computer program (28Fabiato A J. Physiol. 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fabiato A J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 78: 457-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and actual free Ca2+ concentrations were measured with Ca2+-sensitive dyes (fluo3 (K d , 390 nm) or calcium green [K d 14 μm]) (23Lin K.-M. Wenegieme E.F. Lu P.-J. Chen C.-S. Yin H.L J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20443-20450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There is reasonable agreement between calculated and actual free Ca2+ up to 5 × 10−6m. The computer program overestimates free Ca2+ at higher calcium concentration. The gelsolin C-half binds actin monomers to prevent polymerization (30Kwiatkowski D. Janmey P.A. Mole J. Yin H.L J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15232-15238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is reflected in an increase in the critical concentration for actin polymerization (C c). Pyrene actin (ranging from 0.2 to 6 × 10−7m) was polymerized in buffer B in the presence of 6 × 10−7m gelsolin C-half for 16 h. Pyrene-actin fluorescence intensity measured at 24 °C was plotted against the total actin concentration (30Kwiatkowski D. Janmey P.A. Mole J. Yin H.L J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15232-15238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), andC c was derived from the xintercept. Fluorescence spectra of gelsolin were recorded at 37 °C with a QM-1 fluorometer (Photon Technology International) as described in Ref. 23Lin K.-M. Wenegieme E.F. Lu P.-J. Chen C.-S. Yin H.L J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20443-20450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar. Gelsolin in 24 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 0.4 mm EGTA was equilibrated with stirring for 3 h in the dark and was transferred to a 1-cm2 quartz cuvette. The sample was excited at 292 nm. CaCl2 (100 or 25 mm) was added in 1-μl increments, and fluorescence was recorded after 5 min of stirring. The decrease in fluorescence emission at 320 nm was expressed as the difference betweenF max and F. F is the fluorescence quenching at a given Ca2+ concentration, andF max is the maximum quenching. The latter value is obtained by extrapolation from the hyperbolic quenching curve using the Hyperbol.fit program in SigmaPlot. F maxcannot be directly measured because the gelsolin sample was diluted by sequential addition of Ca2+ solution.(F max − F) was plotted against measured free Ca2+ concentrations. Plasmin and chymotrypsin were purchased from Sigma. Stock solutions containing 100 μg/ml enzyme were prepared and added to gelsolin in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA and a range of Ca2+ concentrations at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped by boiling in SDS gel sample buffer. Polypeptides were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by Coomassie Blue staining. They were mapped by Western blotting with epitope-specific antibodies, and in some cases, by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Ca2+binding was determined using the Centrifree micropartition system (Amicon). Proteins were dialyzed for 48 h against 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl prepared in Ca2+-free water. 150 μl of 1.0 × 10−5m gelsolin or GS744 was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 45CaCl2 (NEN Life Science Products) in Centrifree microconcentrators. The CaCl2concentration ranged from 0.025 to 6 × 10−5m and has a specific activity of 1.14–1.5 × 104 cpm/nmol. The microconcentrators were centrifuged in a fixed angle rotor at 1000 × g for 1 min.45Ca in 10-μl aliquots of the retentate and the ultrafiltrate was determined by scintillation counting. Values for bound Ca2+ were obtained by subtracting free Ca2+ in the ultrafiltrate from that in the retentate. The stoichiometry of binding and the K d are determined from the Scatchard plot (31Scatchard G Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17798) Google Scholar) and analyzed by linear regression using SigmaPlot. There is considerable disagreement as to how much Ca2+ is required to activate gelsolin. Conflicting results may be due to different methods used to measure gelsolin function, the existence of disulfide and non-disulfide-bonded gelsolins (26Wen D. Corina K. Chow E.P. Miller S. Janmey P.A. Pepinsky R.B Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9700-9709Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Allen P.G FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the effect of pH on Ca2+ sensitivity (21Lamb J.A. Allen P.G. Tuan B.Y. Janmey P.A J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8999-9004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lin K.-M. Wenegieme E.F. Lu P.-J. Chen C.-S. Yin H.L J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20443-20450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to characterize severing with recombinant gelsolin that is not disulfide-bonded and therefore equivalent to cytoplasmic gelsolin. Severing was assayed at 37 °C instead of at room temperature used in most previous studies. The pyrene-actin depolymerizing assay shows that at 37 °C, gelsolin severing is detectable at 5 × 10−7m, becomes half-maximal at 2.2 × 10−6m and continues to increase up to 10−4m (Fig.1 B). The Ca2+concentration at which half-maximal severing is observed is defined as the apparent K sev/Ca. At 24 °C, severing is not detected until 1.0 × 10−5m and is half-maximal at 1.9 × 10−5mCa2+ (Fig. 1 C). The latter value agrees with those reported by others at room temperature (20Kinosian H.J. Newman J. Lincoln B. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E Biophy. J. 1998; 75: 3092-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Lamb J.A. Allen P.G. Tuan B.Y. Janmey P.A J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8999-9004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the rate of gelsolin severing at 24 °C is highly Ca2+-dependent (20Kinosian H.J. Newman J. Lincoln B. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E Biophy. J. 1998; 75: 3092-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Allen P.G. Janmey P.A J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32916-32923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the 10-fold increase in apparent K sev/Ca probably reflects the fact that severing has not reached steady state at 24 °C (20Kinosian H.J. Newman J. Lincoln B. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E Biophy. J. 1998; 75: 3092-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis is used to determine whether gelsolin conformation is affected by temperature. For these studies, we use plasmin that cleaves gelsolin in a Ca2+- and disulfide bond-dependent manner (26Wen D. Corina K. Chow E.P. Miller S. Janmey P.A. Pepinsky R.B Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9700-9709Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As reported previously (13Pope B.J. Gooch J.T. Weeds A.G Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15848-15855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,26Wen D. Corina K. Chow E.P. Miller S. Janmey P.A. Pepinsky R.B Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9700-9709Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), plasmin cleaves reduced and oxidized gelsolin after Lys150 (in S2) to generate a 70-kDa fragment in EGTA (Fig.2 A, lanes 4 and5). In Ca2+ and at 37 °C, plasmin cleaves non-disulfide-bonded gelsolin further into a 65-kDa fragment (after R228 in S2) and , to a smaller extent, a 45-kDa fragment (after Lys367 in the S3–4 linker) (lane 2). It does not cleave disulfide-bonded gelsolin at R228 (lane 3). In contrast, at 24 °C and in Ca2+, plasmin does not cleave reduced gelsolin at R228 (Fig. 2 B, comparelanes 2 and 6 with lanes 3 and7). The difference in plasmin sensitivity at 37 °C and that at 24 °C suggests that room temperature stabilizes non-disulfide-bonded gelsolin S2 in an inactive conformation resembling that of disulfide-bonded S2. This may account for the low severing activity at 24 °C. We cannot explain at present why our results contradict a previous study finding that disulfide bonding enhances Ca2+ activation of severing (27Allen P.G FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our results stress the importance of studying gelsolin at 37 °C and establish that gelsolin can be activated to sever actin filaments at physiologically relevant submicromolar Ca2+ concentration and temperature. We reported previously that gelsolin with C-terminal deletion to residue 738 (GS738) severs actin much more weakly in 1 mm EGTA than in 0.2 mm Ca2+, whereas GS732 is fully active in EGTA (10Kwiatkowski D. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These residues are part of the S6 tail (Fig. 1 A). GS738 is missing the tail helix and part of the tail loop, whereas GS732 is missing the entire tail (12Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although these previous results were frequently cited to support the latch hypothesis (13Pope B.J. Gooch J.T. Weeds A.G Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15848-15855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Kinosian H.J. Newman J. Lincoln B. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E Biophy. J. 1998; 75: 3092-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the apparently wild type behavior of the tail helix truncated GS738 actually contradicts the current model. In light of the recent findings that gelsolin has micromolar and submicromolar affinity Ca2+-binding sites (18Pope B. Maciver S. Weeds A Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1583-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and that the rate of severing is highly Ca2+ dependent (20Kinosian H.J. Newman J. Lincoln B. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E Biophy. J. 1998; 75: 3092-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Allen P.G. Janmey P.A J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32916-32923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we re-examined this issue. We studied the behavior of gelsolin missing only the tail helix (GS744), the tail helix and part of the tail loop (GS738), or the entire tail (GS732) in a range of Ca2+concentrations. The Ca2+ response curve of GS744 is dramatically shifted to the left compared with full-length gelsolin. At 37 °C, GS744 has 20% maximum severing activity in EGTA and is already 65% active at 6 × 10−8m Ca2+ (Fig.1 B). At 24 °C, GS744 is 48% active at 6 × 10−8m Ca2+ (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were obtained with GS738 (data not shown). Thus deletion of the tail helix alone (GS744) is sufficient to lower the Ca2+ requirement for severing and to minimize the difference between 37 °C and 24 °C. We conclude that 10−6m Ca2+ is required for tail helix unlatching or the conformational change immediately after unlatching, and these processes are more efficient at 37 °C. As shown previously, GS732 severs independently of Ca2+ at both temperatures. Because tail helix deletion decreases the Ca2+ requirement for severing by more than 30-fold (from 2.2 × 10−6to 0.06 × 10−6m), the tail helix must have a primary role in the Ca2+ regulation of severing. This may be achieved through a tail to S2 blockage (the latch mechanism) or through a direct effect on the C-half. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested the effect of tail deletion on the Ca2+ dependence of the gelsolin C-half interaction with actin monomers. C-half binding to actin monomers is reflected in an increase in the critical concentration (C c) for actin polymerization (30Kwiatkowski D. Janmey P.A. Mole J. Yin H.L J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15232-15238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CT755 (wild type C-terminal half) binds actin in the presence of Ca2+ (as reflected by the increase inC c at the x intercept) but does not bind actin in EGTA (no increase in C c above the actin control) (Fig. 3 A). Likewise, CT738 and CT744 bind actin monomer only in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, CT732 binds actin equally well in Ca2+ or EGTA (Fig. 3 A). Ca2+ titration shows that CT755, CT744, and CT738 are already active at 4 × 10−6mCa2+, and all are half-maximally active at around 10−6m Ca2+ (Fig. 3 C). Thus, deletion of the tail helix and part of the tail loop (to residues 744 and 738) has minimal effect on the Ca2+ requirement for C-half binding to actin. The reduced Ca2+ requirement for severing by the corresponding gelsolins is not due to Ca2+-independent activation of the C-half per se. Deletion of the entire tail (CT732) generates Ca2+-independent actin binding (Fig. 3, B andC), suggesting that tail loop residues between Trp732 and Asp737 contribute to Ca2+ regulation of the C-half but in a different way that is not yet understood. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was used to monitor conformational changes at 37 °C. Ca2+ induces a dose-dependent and saturable decrease in fluorescence without shifting the emission maximum at 320 nm (data not shown). A plot of fluorescence quenching versus Ca2+reveals a three-component response (Fig.4 A). The first two components are saturable (Fig. 4, B and C). The third approaches saturability at above 1 × 10−5m (Fig. 4 A). There is a hint that fluorescence may continue to rise at greater than 1 × 10−4m. This may be attributed to nonspecific binding at unphysiologically high Ca2+ concentrations. The apparentK d for Ca2+ of the three components are 0.1 × 10−6, 0.3 × 10−6, and 6.3 × 10−6m, respectively (TableI). The first two values are within the range of the gelsolin submicromolar Ca2+-binding sites (9McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.-G. Weeds A.G. A Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar,17Way M. Gooch J. Pope B. Weeds A.G J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 6), whereas the third is higher than any currently identified Ca2+-binding site (9McLaughlin P.J. Go"

For example, the tissues of cartilaginous fishes characteristically contain high levels of urea, as part of a strategem for increasing blood osmolality in seawater. (1Bedford J.J. Harper J.H.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar); however, this effect can be offset by maintaining a cellular environment rich in “counteracting osmolytes,” particularly trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)1 and glycine betaine (3Yancey P.H.

The present work seeks to address this issue by examining the (in vitro) effects of urea and TMAO on both the activity and three-dimensional structure of a model protein, based on NMR spectroscopy. Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A) was selected as the model in this study, as it is a well characterized protein (7Santoro J. Gonzalez C. Bruix M. Niera J.L. Nieto J.L. Herranz J. Rico M. J.

Ribonuclease A (type XIIA), polyuridylic acid, trimethylamine-N-oxide (Sigma), and urea (BDH) were used without further purification. 31P NMR assays were carried out at 25 °C in either a 0.1 mimidazole·HCl buffer (pH 6.98) or a 50 mm potassium hydrogen phthalate buffer (pH 3.98) containing NaCl (0.2m), poly(U) (6 mm in P–O5′ bonds), urea (0–2 m), TMAO (0–1 m), and RNase (0.1 μm for pH 6.98, 2 μm for pH 3.98). Each reaction was monitored for 11–12 h. Data were collected on a Varian Unity Inova spectrometer, operating at 202.299 mHz, using the following parameters: pulse width, 90°; acquisition time, 1.594 s; relaxation delay, 0.5 s; number of transients, 256; sweep width, 14215 Hz.31P NMR spectra were referenced (δ = 0 ppm) to external H3PO4 (0.3 m). Relative integrated intensities of the poly(U) peak were measured as a function of time and these data were fitted (R > 98%) to an exponential function using Excel®. The lifetimes, listed in Table I, were determined when the peak was 50% of the original intensity. Experimental conditions: 0.1 m imidazole · HCl buffer + 0.2 m NaCl, pH 6.98, RNase concentration 0.1 μm. 6 mm poly(U) implies a concentration of 6 mm in P–O5′ bonds.

Sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-d 4-propionate (1 mm) was added as the internal reference (δ = 0 ppm). Spectra were acquired on the Varian Unity Inova spectrometer, operating at 499.7393 MHz at 35 °C, in the phase-sensitive mode, with the carrier frequency at the middle of the spectrum. A mixing time of 0.15 s was used, and spectra were collected with 16 transients and 128 increments. Water suppression was achieved using the WETNOESY (10Ogg R.J. Kingsley P.B. Taylor J.S. J. Magn.

Rev. 1998; 98: 1045-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) involves enzyme-catalyzed formation of cyclic phosphodiester intermediates, which are transformed ultimately to a monomeric phosphate species. The key amino acid residues involved in the process are His12 and His119. It has been shown that the RNase A-catalyzed hydrolysis of polyuridylic acid (poly(U)) can be monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy. (15Thompson J.E. Venegas F.D. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7408-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16delCardayre S.B. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) The present work uses 31P NMR as an assay method for determining the effects of osmolytes on the first (transphorylation) step of the reaction, by examining the rate of removal of poly(U) from the reaction mixture. 31P NMR spectra collected at different time intervals during the reaction show four groups of 31P resonances, corresponding to the presence of: polyuridylic acid (poly(U)), uridine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (U>p), poly(U)-3′-(uridyl-2′, 3′-cyclic phosphate) (poly (U)U>p), and uridine 3′-phosphate (15Thompson J.E. Venegas F.D. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7408-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Representative 31P spectra, collected at time intervals during the RNase A-catalyzed hydrolysis of poly(U), are displayed in Fig. 1. The resonances correlate well with published data (15Thompson J.E. Venegas F.D. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7408-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and are assigned as shown. Before the addition of RNase A, the peak assigned to poly(U) is observed as a sharp singlet; however, in spectra collected after the addition of the enzyme, a family of peaks is observed in this region, reflecting the increasing size heterogeneity of the poly(U) chain. Similarly, after the initiation of the reaction a group of peaks is seen in the spectral region assigned to poly(U)U>p. Fig. 2 shows a set of four spectra corresponding to separate reaction mixtures containing either urea, urea + TMAO, or no osmolytes. A comparison of these spectra with those in Fig. 1 shows clearly that the intermediate species formed during the RNase A-catalyzed reaction are also produced in the presence of TMAO and urea. Thus it seems reasonable to assume that the general mechanism of the reaction is the same in each case. The spectra in Fig. 2 were obtained with comparable initial concentrations of poly(U) and RNase A, at a convenient time (21 min) after reaction initiation. In the unmodified system (Fig. 2 A), resonances are observed for poly(U) and the cyclic phosphate intermediates poly(U)U>p and U>p. However, in the presence of 1 m urea (Fig. 2 B), only a relatively small amount of U>p is observed at the same time. Because U>p is the second identifiable species formed during the course of the reaction, the hydrolysis in this case is proceeding more slowly than in the unmodified situation. Spectra obtained from reaction mixtures containing both TMAO and urea (Figs. 2, C andD) are similar to the original (Fig. 2 A), which demonstrates that although the activity of RNase is modified in the presence of urea, this effect is counteracted by TMAO. To examine the effects of different osmolyte concentrations and ratios on the reactivity of RNase A, a series of 31P NMR experiments were conducted with varying concentrations of urea and TMAO. To facilitate comparisons, a “lifetime” of poly(U) was used, representing the time required for the relative integral of the combined poly(U) resonances to reduce by half. The results shown (TableI) are the mean of either two or three experiments. From Table I it is evident that as the concentration of urea is increased and the lifetime of poly(U) also increases (entry 1versus entries 2–5). However, at constant concentration of urea (entries 6–8 and 9–11), the lifetime decreases with increasing TMAO concentration, such that for 1:1 urea:TMAO, the original (entry 1) reactivity is recovered. This result is observed for both of the urea concentrations (700 mm and 1 m) examined. Interestingly, in the presence of TMAO alone (entry 12), the lifetime is decreased relative to the osmolyte-free case, which demonstrates that, at least under these reaction conditions, TMAO itself does affect RNase A activity. The 31P NMR results presented here do not show a correlation between urea concentration and the rate of the last step,viz. U>p → uridine 3′-phosphate, in the reaction sequence. It has been proposed (15Thompson J.E. Venegas F.D. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7408-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that after the first (transphorylation) step, the substrate is released from the enzyme active site before further reaction. This release takes place even though the two histidine residues (His12 and His119) are appropriately protonated and in position for the next step in the reaction. As the final step is not dependent upon U>p being associated with the enzyme, it follows that the rate of production of uridine 3′-phosphate should not be influenced by enzyme activity, provided appropriate concentrations of intermediates are maintained. A set of 31P NMR assays was also performed at pH 3.98 to allow comparison with the results of structural studies (see below). In concert with the data obtained at pH 6.98, it is found that the lifetime for poly(U) concentration is increased in the presence of urea, compared with the unmodified case; however, TMAO shows no counteracting effect. This observation may reflect that TMAO is mostly protonated at pH 4 (see “Discussion”). Considerations of the mode of action of counteracting osmolytes on proteins have focused on whether there is a direct protein-osmolyte interaction (4Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 6Lin T.-Y. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12695-12701Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) or an indirect, solvent-mediated (“water structuring”) effect (17Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2868) Google Scholar). The present work uses two-dimensional 1H NOESY NMR studies to probe aspects of the action of TMAO on RNase A. 1H NMR has previously been used to determine the solution structure of RNase A (9Rico M. Bruix M. Santoro J. Gonzalez C. Niera J.L. Nieto J.L. Herranz J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the data are available on the Protein Data Bank (12Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (24367) Google Scholar) and BioMagResBank. Hence, this protein is a convenient model for NOESY studies. The structural characterization of RNase A relies heavily on NOESY spectra, and the search program BBReader (11Wimmer R. Muller N. Petersen S.B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) used in the present study, has been developed to search such data. The 1H NOESY NMR spectrum of RNase A was found to match that described previously (9Rico M. Bruix M. Santoro J. Gonzalez C. Niera J.L. Nieto J.L. Herranz J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), obtained under the same experimental conditions. NOESY spectra of RNase A were then collected in the presence of varying concentrations of osmolytes and compared with the osmolyte-free spectra. Cross-peaks which were removed (“deleted”) from the baseline spectrum by the addition of the osmolyte indicated the particular hydrogen-hydrogen internuclear distance had increased to over 6 Å. The deletions were assigned to specific amino acid residues using a BBReader, and therefore it was possible to determine which regions of the RNase A molecule were affected. Similar experiments have been reported with a hen egg white lysozyme/sorbitol system. (19Wimmer R. Olsson M. Neves Petersen M.T. Hatti-Kaul R. Petersen S.B. Muller N. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 55: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) Spectra obtained with the relatively high concentrations of urea used in the 31P NMR assays were inconclusive because of difficulties in obtaining useful data. NOESY spectra of mixtures of RNase A and lower concentrations of urea did not show any discernable effects. The study therefore focused on an examination of the influence of TMAO alone, and Table II summarizes the persistent and reproducible deletions from the NOESY spectra over the range of TMAO concentrations examined and the related internuclear distances in the unmodified enzyme. The first two TMAO-induced spectral deletions (Table II) correspond to sequential contacts but, notably, the latter two indicate substantial increases (>2 Å) in the natural hydrogen-hydrogen internuclear distances between two β-sheets and also between a helix and a sheet in RNase A. Depending on the TMAO concentration, additional deletions were observed (cf. “Experimental Procedures”). Most of the data were assigned with a confidence level of greater than 85% as determined from percentage “scores” calculated by the BBReader program, on the basis both of the closeness of the chemical shift values to those in the published data, and of the distance between the two protons. These additional deletions were all short range intraresidue, sequential or i, i+2 contacts and as such do not provide additional structural information. Two histidine residues (His12 and His119) have been identified in the active site of RNase A (8Raines R.T. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1045-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) and are therefore of interest for catalytic activity. None of the deletions noted involve either of these histidine residues. Furthermore, the NOESY spectrum of RNase A shows a cross-peak, which can be confidently (94%) assigned to a correlation between His119 H and Phe120 HA protons. This peak is not altered by the addition of TMAO, suggesting that the osmolyte does not have a direct interaction at this active site area. However, there is some indication that at least one of the subsite regions (viz. Thr45, located in the B1 subsite (8Raines R.T. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1045-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar)) is modified by the presence of TMAO. The effects of TMAO and other osmolytes on some of the physical properties of RNase A have been well documented (3Yancey P.H. Somero G.N. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 5Burg M.B. Peters E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F762-F765PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Burg and Peters (5Burg M.B. Peters E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F762-F765PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that urea lowers the midpoint of thermal transition (Tm ) of RNase A, whereas glycerophosphocholine and TMAO counteract this effect. Yancey and Somero (3Yancey P.H. Somero G.N. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) also noted that TMAO and β-alanine increaseTm and that this structure stabilization occurs even at relatively low concentrations (∼0.1 m) (3Yancey P.H. Somero G.N. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The previous results are in concert with the findings reported here. However, the NMR data provide information at a more detailed molecular level and show that the reactivity of the enzyme is decreased in the presence of urea but is clearly recovered in urea/TMAO mixtures. Furthermore, it has long been postulated that the ratio of TMAO:urea is significant and that an approximate 1:2 molar ratio often gives optimal counteraction (3Yancey P.H. Somero G.N. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 20Burg M.B. Peters E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F1048-F1053PubMed Google Scholar, 21Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Peters E.M. Kidney Int. 1996; 50 Suppl. 57: 100-104Google Scholar). Under the experimental conditions used in this work, a 1:1 ratio is found to be sufficient to recover the activity of RNase A. To base the NOESY analysis on the established data, it was necessary to obtain spectra under the same experimental conditions. In particular, measurements at pH 4 were required. It should be noted that at this pH, most of the TMAO (pK a 5.13 (22Perrin D.D. Dissociation Constants of Organic Bases in Aqueous Solution. Butterworth & Co. Ltd., London1965: 32Google Scholar)) is in the protonated conjugate acid form and the counteracting effect was not apparent (see above). Notwithstanding these limitations, the NOESY experiments indicate that, even at low effective concentrations, TMAO can cause detectable structural changes in some segments of the enzyme. This contrasts with the hen egg white lysozyme study, where a much larger concentration of the perturbing compound was required to induce any observable changes (19Wimmer R. Olsson M. Neves Petersen M.T. Hatti-Kaul R. Petersen S.B. Muller N. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 55: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In that case, two new cross-peaks were observed in the NOESY spectrum, and some chemical shift changes were also noted. As noted above, there are at least two ways in which TMAO might influence enzyme structure and activity. These include a direct osmolyte-protein interaction or a solvent-mediated effect that induces a “global” change in the environment around the protein. For example, it has been proposed that organic osmolytes can influence hydrogen bonding of solvent molecules over long distances (18Zeidler M.D. Franks F. Water: A Comprehensive Treatise. 2. Plenum, New York1973: 529Google Scholar). This work has shown that TMAO alone at pH 4 does not induce changes in the RNase molecule at or near the active site, and at best, minor structural structural changes are introduced in other regions of the molecule. The osmolyte has a more dispersed, global effect on the protein, which is presumably effected via the solvent, rather than a specific interaction at particular site(s). In summary, by using 31P NMR spectroscopy, it has been demonstrated unequivocally that the activity of RNase A, lowered in the presence of urea, can be recovered with TMAO in molar ratios of approximately 1:1. NOESY studies with RNase A have shown that even at relatively low effective concentrations of TMAO some, albeit small, changes in the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecule can be detected. Minor changes in protein structure at locations outside the active site have been postulated previously to affect kinetic properties (14Holland L.Z. McFall-Ngai M. Somero G.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3207-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We are grateful to Dr. C. R. Clark and Dr. R. Wimmer for helpful discussions."

FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Besides the cyclooxygenase activity, both PGHS-1 and -2 have a heme-dependent peroxidase activity (1Smith W.L. Garavito R.M.

The PGHS peroxidase catalytic cycle resembles that of other heme-dependent peroxidases: the ferric heme of the resting enzyme is oxidized to Intermediate I (Compound I) by reaction with peroxide, and electron-donating cosubstrates complete the peroxidase catalytic cycle by reducing Intermediate I to Compound II and then to resting enzyme (3Lambeir A.-M.

Many mechanistic schemes have been devised to account for stimulation of cyclooxygenase velocity. One strategy has been to suggest that the reductive action of cosubstrates retrieves enzyme from catalytically unproductive oxidized intermediates (11Hemler M.E. Lands W.E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5527-5536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but simultaneous binding of cosubstrate and arachidonate seems at odds with spatial constraints at the top of the cyclooxygenase channel in crystallographic models (18Picot D.

In the present work, we used kinetic simulations based on an extended branched-chain mechanism to evaluate the possibility that cosubstrates stimulate cyclooxygenase velocity via rescue of intermediates in the peroxide-induced self-inactivation pathway. The kinetic simulations predicted that peroxidase cosubstrates greatly increase the number of cyclooxygenase catalytic turnovers before self-inactivation but with only a small increase in the cyclooxygenase rate. The simulations also predicted that uncorrected oxygen electrode measurements can greatly exaggerate the stimulatory effects of cosubstrate on cyclooxygenase velocity.Oxygen electrode measurements have been the mainstay of previous detailed studies of cosubstrate effects on cyclooxygenase velocity; because the potential problems were not suspected, these studies did not correct the electrode data for dampening effects (11Hemler M.E. Lands W.E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6253-6261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M.

This situation prompted a detailed re-examination of the actions of several cosubstrates on PGHS-1 cyclooxygenase kinetics under conditions permitting reliable correction of oxygen electrode signals. The results indicate that cosubstrates actually increase the peak cyclooxygenase velocity much less than previously reported. This surprising observation greatly simplifies the kinetic behavior that putative reaction mechanisms must account for and removes what had been a major weakness of branched-chain mechanisms.MATERIALS AND METHODSArachidonic acid was purchased from NuChek Preps, Inc. (Elysian, MN). Heme, phenol, TMPD, and acetaminophen were from Sigma. Trolox was from Aldrich. PGHS-1 was purified to homogeneity from sheep seminal vesicles and reconstituted with an equimolar amount of heme before use (30Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. Benedetto C. McDonald-Gibson R.G. Nigam S. Slater T.F. Prostaglandins and Related Substances: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 209-227Google Scholar).Oxygen consumption during the cyclooxygenase reaction was monitored with a Model 53 oxygen electrode system (YSI, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH) connected to a Model ADC-1 A/D converter (Remote Measurement Systems, Seattle, WA) and an Apple Macintosh SE computer (31Chen W. Pawelek T.R. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20301-20306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A “High Sensitivity” membrane (YSI model 5776) was used to cover the electrode. The reaction buffer (3 ml of either 0.1 mpotassium phosphate, pH 7.2, or 0.1 m borate, pH 9.8) contained 100 μm arachidonate and 1 μmheme. Reactions were initiated by injection of enzyme. When desired, digitized oxygen concentration values from the electrode were corrected for the dampening effects of the membrane using the electrode response kinetics determined from injection of buffer saturated with nitrogen gas (15Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8499-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Cook H.W. Ford G. Lands W.E.M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 96: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).For measurement of oxygen electrode cuvette mixing kinetics, the apparatus was set up just as for cyclooxygenase reaction measurements, except that the water circulator used to regulate temperature was turned off, and the water bath surrounding the cuvette was drained. The cuvette was filled with 3 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, the electrode/probe assembly was inserted, and stirring was established at 900 rpm. The beam from a laser pointer (Radio Shack LX 3000) was directed horizontally through the center of the liquid column in the cuvette, striking a photovoltaic cell (Radio Shack 0.75 × 1.5 in) on the other side. The photovoltaic cell output voltage was fed to a chart recorder (Kipp & Zonen Model BD111) set at 0.5 V/full scale and 2.0 cm/s. A purple dye solution was made by oxidizing TMPD with potassium ferricyanide. When injected into the cuvette, the purple chromophore strongly absorbed the red laser light, decreasing the voltage produced by the photocell. Recorder traces were obtained for several injections of oxidized TMPD, the traces were digitized (Data Thief, K, Huyser and J. van der Laan, National Institute for Nuclear Physics and High Energy Physics, The Netherlands), and the data were fitted to a single-exponential decay equation. The resulting mixing rate constant was 5.7 s−1, indicating that mixing was essentially complete within about 0.6 s after injection.Computer simulations of the effect of cosubstrate on cyclooxygenase kinetics were carried out by numerical integration using the SCoP program (Simulation Resources, Redlands, CA). Calculations were based on the PGHS mechanism shown in Fig. 1, which is derived from our earlier mechanism (28Lu G. Tsai A. Van Wart H.E. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16162-16167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with the addition of a two-step inactivation process (steps k7 and k9 ) involving Intermediate III to parallel the peroxidase inactivation mechanism described by Wu et al.

The initial concentrations and parameter values shown in TableI are based on those for PGHS-1 (28Lu G. Tsai A. Van Wart H.E. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16162-16167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The values of k 7 (conversion of Intermediate II (E(IV)/PPIX/Tyr*) to Intermediate III (E(IV)/PPIX/X*)) andk9 (conversion of Intermediate III to E(inact)), 1 and 0.05 s−1, respectively, reflect observed rates during PGHS-1 peroxidase self-inactivation (29Wu G. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Osawa Y. Tsai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9231-9237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Reduction of Intermediate III by cosubstrate (k 8) was set up as a saturable process, with a maximum rate of 0.002 s−1 and aK m for cosubstrate (K mAH) of 0.1 mm based on the phenol concentration reported to give half-maximal stimulation of the cyclooxygenase (12Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. Prostaglandins. 1985; 29: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Hsuanyu Y. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17649-17657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two sets of cyclooxygenase reaction time courses were generated in each simulation run. The first time course was that for changes in arachidonate concentration ([AA]) in the bulk reaction (Equation 9). The second time course was for changes in arachidonate concentration that would be determined from the output of an oxygen electrode immersed in the bulk reaction ([AAe]) (Equation10). The latter reflect attenuation by a membrane diffusion factor (k Diff); the value ofk Diff, 0.25 s−1, approximates the response rate of the YSI oxygen electrode covered by a “standard” membrane (15Wei C.

Because of the fixed substrate stoichiometry (27Tsai A. Wu G. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13085-13094Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), multiplication by a factor of two provides the corresponding value for oxygen consumption.Table IParameter values used for kinetic simulations with the mechanism shown in Fig. 1ParameterValueUnitsk11 × 108m−1s−1k2350s−1k34 × 105m−1s−1k44 × 105m−1s−1k5 60s−1k62 × 103m−1s−1k7 1s−1k82 × 10−3s−1k95 × 10−2s−1kDiff 0.25s−1K mAA3 × 10−6K mAH1 × 10−4mE(III)/PPIX/Tyr01 × 10−8mE(IV)/PPIX*/Tyr00mE(IV)/PPIX/Tyr00mE(III)/PPIX/Tyr*00mE(IV)/PPIX*/Tyr*00mE(IV)/PPIX/Tyr*00mE(IV)/PPIX/X*00mE(inact)00mAA01 × 10−4mROOH01.7 × 10−7mROH00mAH0Variablem Open table in a new tab RESULTSThe tyrosyl radical at Tyr385 in Intermediate II is thought to be a key intermediate in cyclooxygenase catalysis (33Marnett L.J.

Recently, self-inactivation of PGHS-1 peroxidase activity was found to involve a pathway originating with Intermediate II (29Wu G. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Osawa Y. Tsai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9231-9237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It thus seemed possible that reduction of an oxidized intermediate in the self-inactivation pathway by cosubstrates might decrease self-inactivation and thereby increase the cyclooxygenase catalytic rate. This possibility was tested by computer simulation of cyclooxygenase reaction kinetics at various cosubstrate levels. The mechanism used for the computer simulations (Fig.1) was adapted from an earlier mechanism (28Lu G. Tsai A. Van Wart H.E. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16162-16167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) by adding an additional step in the self-inactivation process (k 7 in Fig. 1) to reflect the observation of Intermediate III (29Wu G. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Osawa Y. Tsai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9231-9237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and by allowing reduction of Intermediate III species by cosubstrate to restore the cyclooxygenase center to ground state (k 8 step in Fig. 1), thereby attenuating self-inactivation. Computer simulations were run to predict the peak cyclooxygenase velocity (also termed the optimal velocity, or V opt) both for the bulk reaction (cuvette value) and as detected by an oxygen electrode (electrode value) at a variety of cosubstrate concentrations (Fig.2). The simulations predicted that the cuvette V opt increases slightly at low cosubstrate concentrations, peaking at about 20% over control at 0.2 mm cosubstrate, and then decreases at higher cosubstrate levels. Surprisingly, the electrode V opt value was predicted to increase markedly at lower cosubstrate levels, peaking at about three times the control value, and then decrease at higher cosubstrate levels. This predicted bimodal response of uncorrected oxygen electrode V opt to cosubstrate level is just the pattern observed in PGHS-1 reactions in the presence of a variety of cosubstrates (12Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. Prostaglandins. 1985; 29: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Hsuanyu Y. Dunford H.B. J. Biol.

Elsevier, Amsterdam1983: 203-223Google Scholar).Figure 2Predicted effects of cosubstrate on cyclooxygenase Vopt. Computer simulations based on the mechanistic scheme in Fig. 1 were used to predict the effect of cosubstrate (AH) concentration on the peak cyclooxygenase velocity (V opt) both in the bulk reaction (filled circles) and as would be reflected by an uncorrected oxygen electrode (open circles). All values are normalized to the controls without added cosubstrate. Details are described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The difference in the predicted electrode and cuvetteV opt responses to cosubstrate level seen in Fig.2 can be traced to the effect of cosubstrate on the cyclooxygenase reaction trajectory and to the response characteristics of the oxygen electrode (Fig. 3). In the absence of cosubstrate, cyclooxygenase catalysis in the cuvette is predicted to occur in a sharp burst, with the velocity peaking within 1 s after beginning the reaction. The predicted oxygen electrode response (a value of 0.25 s−1 was used to simulate the behavior with a standard membrane) is attenuated and spread out; the predicted electrode V opt is thus smaller and is registered later than the cuvette V opt (Fig. 3). The addition of cosubstrate is predicted to slow and prolong cyclooxygenase catalysis in the cuvette (Fig. 3). Slower reactions are less attenuated by the electrode response than fast reactions, so the electrodeV opt at 1 mm cosubstrate is predicted to be larger than the control value, even though the cuvetteV opt is predicted to be somewhat lower than the corresponding control (Fig. 3).Figure 3Predicted effects of cosubstrate on cyclooxygenase reaction trajectory. Detailed predictions of substrate consumption as a function of time are shown for simulated cyclooxygenase reactions in the presence of 1 mmcosubstrate (filled symbols) or without cosubstrate (open symbols). In each case, reaction trajectories are shown for the bulk reaction in the cuvette (circles) and as would be reflected by uncorrected oxygen electrode data (triangles). Solid lines tangent to the trajectories indicate the peak velocities for bulk reaction in the cuvette (V opt(c)) and for uncorrected oxygen electrode data (V opt(e)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These computer simulations suggested that uncorrected oxygen electrode observations may give a distorted picture of the effects of reducing cosubstrates on the cyclooxygenase catalytic velocity. This prompted a detailed re-examination of the actions of cosubstrate on cyclooxygenase kinetics. The oxygen electrode is particularly valuable to kinetic analyses because it allows convenient and continuous monitoring of cyclooxygenase catalysis. Once corrected for membrane dampening, electrode values for cyclooxygenase activity in relatively slow reactions track well with results obtained with cumbersome, discontinuous measurements with radiolabeled substrate (31Chen W. Pawelek T.R. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20301-20306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Decreasing the reaction temperature was the first approach used to slow the cyclooxygenase kinetics so that the bulk of the reaction occurred after completion of mixing, which required about 0.6 s−1(see “Materials and Methods”). The cyclooxygenase kinetics at 25 and 5 °C in the presence and absence of phenol are compared in Fig.4. Without phenol at 25 °C (upper panel in Fig. 4), the uncorrected electrode data register oxygen consumption beginning after 1 s; correction for membrane dampening makes it apparent that oxygen consumption begins well before 1 s, within the time required for mixing. The addition of 1 mm phenol slowed the cyclooxygenase reaction, with oxygen consumption beginning after 2 s in the uncorrected electrode data and at around 1 s in the corrected data. As expected, phenol also increased the number of cyclooxygenase turnovers before self-inactivation, with the reaction extent at 30 s increasing from 4.2 μm O2 in the control to 16.3 μm O2 with 1 mm phenol. This represents an increase in catalytic turnovers from 110 to 430.Figure 4Effects of decreased temperature on cyclooxygenase kinetics. Cyclooxygenase kinetics were monitored with the oxygen electrode for either 19 nm PGHS-1 at 25 °C (upper panel) or for 47 nm PGHS-1 at 5 °C (lower panel) in the presence (thick lines) or absence (thin lines) of 1 mmphenol. The reaction buffer was 3 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 100 μm arachidonate. Uncorrected electrode data are represented by solid lines, and data corrected (15Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8499-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) for the membrane relaxation rate (0.23 s−1 at 5 °C and 0.56 s−1 at 25 °C) are represented by dotted lines. Corrected cyclooxygenase-specific activities were 5.2 mol arachidonate/mol PGHS-1 heme/s at 5 °C and 66 mol arachidonate/mol PGHS-1 heme/s at 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The reaction at 5 °C without phenol was considerably slower than at 25 °C, with oxygen consumption apparent only after 4 s in the corrected electrode data (Fig. 4, lower panel). A considerably higher level of PGHS-1 was used for reactions at 5 °C (47 nm) than at 25 °C (19 nm) to improve the signal/noise ratio in the early part of the reaction at the lower temperature. The addition of 1 mm phenol at 5 °C appeared to affect primarily the extent of the cyclooxygenase reaction, which reached a corrected O2 consumption of 9 μm at 30 s, compared with about 4 μmin the control. It is clear from the results in Fig. 4 that the bulk of the cyclooxygenase reaction at 5 °C, bot"

Such interactions are important in regulating cell behavior and fibril formation during development and physiological events. Although collagen V is involved in a plethora of specific interactions and thus might possess various domain-specific functions, binding sites have not yet been mapped except for the heparin-binding site. Heparin is abundant in animal tissues in the form of heparan sulfate proteoglycans both on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. A 30-kDa heparin-binding fragment of the α1(V) chain has been isolated and was shown to bind heparin with the same affinity as the complete parental chain (12Yaoi Y. Hashimoto K. Koitabashi H. Takahara K. Ito M. Kato I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The binding site is exclusive to this chain since the two other chains,viz. α2(V) and α3(V), which can also be part of collagen V molecules, have no affinity for heparin (11Delacoux F. Fichard A.

Heparin-binding sites are found in a wide range of proteins including collagens and in a broad repertoire of extracellular matrix proteins,viz. fibronectin, tenascin, and laminin. They are all characterized by an overall positive charge, and common structural motifs have been proposed from the analysis of the different heparin-binding site primary sequences. The consensus sequences BBXB, XBBXBX, andXBBBXXBX (where B designates a basic amino acid and X designates any other residues) have been identified (14Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R.

HepV does contain a stretch of cationic amino acids (Arg900–Arg924), but a synthetic peptide that was designed to encompass this sequence was shown to have negligible affinity for immobilized heparin under physiological conditions. Also, the synthetic peptide failed to compete with HepV or with the complete α1(V) chain in a heparin binding assay. This result led to the hypothesis that the peptide conformation or/and the flanking residues might be crucial for efficient binding to heparin (11Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The characteristics of the collagen V heparin-binding site might be somehow more subtle than previously thought. Based on the fact that recombinant HepV binds to heparin with the same relative affinity as the parental α1(V) chain, all 7 basic residues contained in the region Arg900–Arg924 were individually mutated, and the resulting expression products were tested for their capacity to bind heparin. In addition, trypsin digestion of HepV bound to heparin was used to map the heparin-binding site owing to the fact that heparin protects this site from trypsin cleavage. The results indicate that collagen V binds to heparin through an extended binding site in which the different basic residues involved do not have the same contribution. The overexpression of the wild-type recombinant fragment has been previously described (11Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the HepV module cDNA was generated by PCR1 using clone 302 of the human α1(V) chain cDNA (15Takahara K. Sato Y. Okasawa K. Okamoto N. Noda A. Yaoi Y. Kato I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13124-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. The oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′-end of the module (5′-WT primer, 5′-TATGAATTCCCATCAAGGGTGATCGGGGGGAGA-3′) and to the 3′-end of the module (3′-WT primer, 5′-TATCTGCAGATTAGGGTCCCCGTTCACCAGGAGGGCCAGCTGG-3′) (see Fig. 1) contained exogenous restriction sites: EcoRI on the 5′-end and PstI on the 3′-end for convenient subcloning downstream of the E. coli phage T7 promoter of a pT7-7 expression vector (16Kamman M. Laufs J. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid pHepV was transformed in an E. coli BL21(DE3) strain carrying the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of the lacpromoter/operator. The recombinant protein was collected 6 h after the induction of the promoter by 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to the procedure of Kamman et al. (16Kamman M. Laufs J. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It is based on a two-round PCR amplification, with the first round leading to the generation of a mega-mutagenic primer, which is then used in a second PCR round, which allows the synthesis of the whole mutated fragment. The pHepV plasmid previously obtained was used as a template for the PCR. During the first PCR, the sequence between one of the different mutagenic primers described in Fig. 1 that contains the targeted mismatched bases in the center and the 3′-WT primer was amplified. Mutations were designed to substitute alanine for any of the basic amino acids. A control using a non-basic amino acid was made by substitution of Thr915with alanine. The fragment obtained was then used as a primer together with the 5′-WT primer to generate the 399-base pair PCR fragment. The PCR product was subcloned in the expression vector; the sequence was thoroughly checked for each sample; and the protein was overexpressed in the same way as the WT module. The mutated plasmid and the protein were named after the mutation, e.g. pR909A and R909A. Following sequence verification and subcloning, variants were expressed in E. coli as described previously (11Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and then sonicated. After centrifugation, supernatants were dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) and then stored at −20 °C until used. Bacterial supernatants were first subjected to cation-exchange chromatography on a HiTrapSP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove most of bacterial protein contaminants. The column was equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Elution was achieved with a linear NaCl gradient (0–300 mm) in the same buffer. Recombinant protein-containing fractions were analyzed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The relative heparin affinities of mutants were determined by binding the mutant-containing fractions to a 1-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and elution with a linear NaCl gradient. The standard gradient was 0–400 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). To accurately compare elution positions of the different mutants, their elution with NaCl gradient was achieved versus a standard HepV elution. Elution patterns of different preparations of a given mutant (n = 3) were highly reproducible. Identification of the mutant proteins in fractions was carried out by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and N-terminal sequencing after electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Problott, Applied Biosystems, Inc.) for 4 h at 60 V in 10 mm CAPS and 5% methanol (pH 11). After brief staining with 0.2% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid (Sigma), the band of interest was excised from the membrane, and amino acid sequence analysis was performed by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 473A Protein Sequencer. HepV was purified to homogeneity by HiTrapSP and monoQ HPLC (11Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant HepV (600 μg) was incubated in batch on a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 15 min at room temperature, and the unbound material was removed with 50 volumes of the above buffer. The bound material was then digested with trypsin (sequencing grade modified trypsin, Promega) for 10 min at room temperature (enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:10). The digestion was stopped by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and the gel was washed with 20 volumes of buffer containing soybean trypsin inhibitor to remove unbound trypsin-digested HepV fragments. Elution of bound fragments was achieved by adding 0.35 m NaCl to the starting buffer. The HepV heparin-binding tryptic fragments were separated by reverse-phase chromatography on a C18 column (Delta-Pak, Waters), and the complete sequences of the purified tryptic fragments were determined by N-terminal sequencing. We have previously designed and produced the recombinant fragment referred to as HepV that encompasses the complete N-terminal part of the 30-kDa CNBr peptide defined by Yaoi et al. (12Yaoi Y. Hashimoto K. Koitabashi H. Takahara K. Ito M. Kato I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the sequence around the endoproteinase Glu-C cleavage site that was found to be determinant for heparin binding (Fig.1) (11Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This recombinant fragment, which spans Ile824–Pro950 of the human α1(V) chain, was found to bind to heparin with the same affinity as the complete human α1(V) chain and thus was identified as the collagen V heparin-binding site (11Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To further characterize this binding site, we undertook to analyze the Arg900–Arg924 region, which contains a stretch of 7 basic residues, by alanine scanning mutagenesis of the basic residues. With this aim, the different arginine and lysine residues spanning this sequence were singly converted to alanine, and the irrelevant Thr915 residue was also mutated to alanine as a control (Fig. 1). The mutated sequences of the recombinant cDNA were all checked thoroughly. Wild-type and mutant recombinant HepV fragments were expressed in bacteria and passed through a cation-exchange chromatography column to remove most of the bacterial protein contaminants from samples before determination of heparin affinities. All the mutated fragments were identified by their migration pattern by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and, when necessary, by N-terminal sequencing after electrotransfer of the band of interest (Fig. 2). For R921A, a band migrating at the position of HepV and two additional bands migrating faster were observed on the gel. These three bands showed identical N-terminal sequences, indicating that this mutant underwent, for some reason, C-terminal trimming. To determine its heparin affinity, only the upper band was considered. The relative affinities of the recombinant proteins for heparin were assessed by sodium chloride elution from a heparin-Sepharose column. The wild-type fragment was eluted from the column at 0.35m NaCl (Fig. 3 A), which is identical to the concentration obtained with the complete natural α1(V) chain (11Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Alanine scanning showed that all mutants retained the heparin-binding activity, but their shift in elution position was compared with the wild-type HepV elution. A considerable difference in the degree of affinities was observed. As expected, the T915A mutation did not affect the fragment affinity for heparin. Mutants R900A and R924A behaved roughly the same as the wild-type HepV fragment. The affinities of mutants K905A and R909A for immobilized heparin were only slightly reduced (0.29 and 0.26m, respectively), whereas mutations of Arg912, Arg918, and Arg921 reduced heparin binding drastically. Actually, these three mutations demonstrated the weakest binding. They all eluted at 0.2 m, which is close to the physiological ionic strength (0.15 m NaCl). Overall, only a limited number of basic residues that form a continuous patch of positively charged residues are critical for heparin binding,viz. Arg912, Arg918, and Arg921. Interestingly, when concentrations of NaCl required for elution were plotted as a function of the position in the primary sequence of any mutated basic residue (Fig. 3 B), the heparin affinity gradually decreased at the vicinity of the Arg912–Arg918–Arg921 cluster, which showed the lowest heparin affinities, and then increased with the next mutated residue, i.e. Arg924. This indicates that heparin binding of the α1(V) chain involves at least 3 basic residues within the HepV fragment and that additional neighboring basic residues (viz. Lys905 and, to a lesser extent, Arg909) might also contribute to heparin binding. Site-directed mutagenesis provides a unique way to determine the residues directly involved in molecular interactions. However, inherent to this method is the possibility that the amino acid substitution is not conservative and thus can modify the overall charge of the polypeptide or its conformation. Therefore, we looked for other evidence to localize the heparin-binding domain based on the fact that heparin might be able to protect the binding site of the complete recombinant HepV polypeptide from proteolytic digestion. With this aim, HepV was bound to a heparin-Sepharose column and subsequently digested with trypsin. The trypsin cleavage sites are Arg-X and Lys-X. These 2 residues are crucial to heparin binding and, as expected, are frequent in the HepV sequence. We speculated that when involved in heparin binding, such residues are protected from trypsin attack. Thus, the use of trypsin in this case might favor the determination of the minimal α1(V) sequence directly involved in heparin binding. After trypsin digestion, the bound fragments were eluted with 0.5m NaCl and separated by reverse-phase chromatography (Fig.4 A). Several different peaks were obtained, and the elution positions of undigested HepV and trypsin were easily identified in comparison with profiles obtained with the different proteins loaded separately (data not shown). Besides these two identified peaks, five peaks numbered from 1 to 5 on the chromatogram (Fig. 4 A) were selected for protein sequencing. The profile clearly indicates that one of the proteolytic fragments, peak 2, is predominant. The complete sequence of this major eluted fragment, determined by Edman degradation, reveals that it spans the sequence Gly910–Arg924 (Fig. 4 B). This sequence encompasses the 3 basic residues Arg912, Arg918, and Arg921. Thus, this corroborates our site-directed mutagenesis experiments and likewise demonstrates the crucial role of these 3 Arg residues in heparin binding. The amino acid sequences of the fragments contained in the other peaks were also determined. The analysis of peak 1 revealed the presence of two fragments named 1A and 1B. The sequence data showed a major sequence (Gly901–Arg912; peak 1B) and a minor one (Gly898–Arg909; peak 1A) (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, these two sequences encompass Lys905 and Arg909, which were shown to contribute to heparin binding; and thus, the results are once again in excellent agreement with our point mutation results. Likewise, the larger proteolytic fragment obtained (peak 3) was identified as the sequence Gly901–Arg924, which exactly overlapped the two shorter sequences determined for peaks 1 and 2, viz.Gly901–Arg912 and Gly910–Arg924 (Fig. 4 B). This observation argues for a larger contribution of Lys905 and Arg909 to heparin binding than expected from the mutagenesis experiments. The N-terminal sequences of peaks 4 and 5 indicated that the fragments started at Gly910 and at the first amino acid residue of the HepV construct, respectively. As expected, these two minor peaks, which showed a longer retention time, likely correspond to incomplete trypsin digestion of HepV, leading to the persistence of uncleaved C-terminal (peak 4) or N-terminal (peak 5) regions. Collagen V occurs in tissues in different chain associations,viz. (α1(V))2 α2(V), α1(V) α2(V) α3(V), and (α1(V))3. The α1(V) chain was shown to be responsible for heparin binding, whereas the two other chains failed to bind heparin under physiological conditions. This can explain the increased affinities for heparin of the different molecules related to the number of α1(V) chains they contain (11Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Mizuno K. Hayashi T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As a general rule, strong heparin affinity generally predicts the potential for a given protein to bind matrix- or membrane-bound heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The binding is mostly dominated by electrostatic interactions between clusters of basic amino acids and the anionic heparin. Such a cluster actually exists in the α1(V) chain. We have previously mapped the binding site within the third N-terminal part of the helicoid domain referred to as the Col1 domain (11Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This region encompasses a linear protein sequence from Arg900 to Arg924 containing an obvious cluster of 7 basic residues that were proposed to include part of the heparin-binding site. The molecular model we have previously proposed (11Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) predicts that the positively charged cluster Lys905–Arg921, which would be expected to form a positive ring all around the surface of the molecule, might function as a heparin-binding site. However, if electrostatic interactions are predominant, the spatial organization of the basic residues can greatly contribute to binding and confer a certain specificity to the interaction (18Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A common spatial pattern was shown to be required for heparin binding, in which basic residues form an amphipathic structure and the basic amino acids at the extremities of the motif are located ∼20 Å apart. This holds true for α-helix and β-strand conformations, but no data are available for the collagenous domain that corresponds to a polyproline type II structure. The molecular modeling of the putative collagen V heparin-binding site did not reveal any obvious spatial arrangement of the basic residues when included into the triple helical collagen V molecule, and inspection of the molecular model did not help us to predict which basic residues within this region are part of the binding site. Moreover, the primary sequence does not fit a consensus sequence already described for other proteins (14Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous collagens contain heparin-binding sites, but they are generally located within the noncollagenous domain, such as is the case for collagen XIV (19Kolialos G.G. Kouzi-Kolialos K. Furcht L.T. Reger L.A. Tsilibary E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2313-2323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and collagen XVIII (20Giry-Lozinguez C. Aubert-Foucher E. Penin F. Deléage G. Dublet B. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), or within a short interruption of the collagenous domain, as in collagen IV (21Sasaki T. Larsson H. Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Claesson-Welsh L. Lindahl U. Hohenester E. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6240-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Collagen I possesses a heparin-binding site that has been mapped within the collagenous domain (22San Antonio J.D. Lander A.D. Karnovski M.J. Slayter H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); but so far, the precise site has not been identified. In this report, we identified, for the first time, the basic residues that confer affinity for heparin to collagen V. The contribution of individual basic residues spanning the region from Arg900to Arg924 has been examined by site-directed mutagenesis of the recombinant HepV fragment. To precisely determined the relative importance of charged residues in this sequence to heparin-mediated binding, we prepared a series of recombinant HepV mutants containing alanine substitutions for the amino acid of interest and tested them by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The results presented here indicate that binding of the α1(V) chain to heparin involves at least 3 neighboring arginines: Arg912, Arg918, and Arg921. Mutations of any one of these residues to alanine strongly decreased the affinity of the HepV fragment for heparin. A lesser but still significant decrease in the concentration of NaCl required for elution from a heparin-Sepharose column was observed for Lys905 and Arg909. Mutations of Arg900 and Arg924 had little (if any) effect on binding, indicating that reduction of the net positive charge cannot account for the observed effects of the other mutations. The results are in agreement with the crucial role of Arg921 in heparin interactions previously suggested by the biochemical data of Yaoiet al. (12Yaoi Y. Hashimoto K. Koitabashi H. Takahara K. Ito M. Kato I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), i.e. they located the heparin-binding site on a 30-kDa CNBr fragment of the α1(V) chain, and they showed that its further cleavage at the Glu920–Arg921 bond by proteolytic digestion greatly reduced heparin binding to the resulting peptides. From the mutagenesis data, the role of Lys905 and Arg909 in heparin binding was not clear. The contributions of the specific basic residues to heparin affinity are not equal, and the nature of these residues can be important. Fromm et al.(23Fromm J.R. Hileman R.E. Caldwell E.E.O. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) showed that arginine-containing peptides bind stronger to heparin than the analogous lysine peptides. This could explain why point mutation of Lys905 only slightly affected heparin affinity. Since both residues have an identical charge of +1, it was suggested that the difference could be due to the intrinsic properties of the side chains. Although the frequency of arginine residues in known heparin-binding sites is greater than that of lysine residues, the latter were shown to be crucial for various heparin-binding sites (24Wong P. Hampton B. Szylobryt E. Gallagher A.M. Jaye M. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25805-25811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Kridel S.J. Chan W.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20935-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Zhao M. Abdel-Razek T. Sun M.-F Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31153-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the low affinity observed between lysine residues and heparin, their role is likely not negligible and might be related to a more flexible side chain that can pair the anionic heparin more readily. To gain more insights into the collagen V heparin-binding site, we sought to determine the exact sequence that fits heparin. With this aim, the ability of heparin to protect the collagen V heparin-binding site against trypsin digestion was assessed. We showed that a good correlation exists between the mutagenesis experiments and the biochemical data. The two major peaks contained fragments that spanned the 3 arginine residues Arg912, Arg918, and Arg921 and the residues Lys905 and Arg909, respectively. More important, from the third most important peak, we sequenced a peptide that covered the extended sequence from Lys905 to Arg921. This result strengthens the crucial role of Lys905 in binding. Heparin is a negatively charged polymer of a regular disaccharide repeat sequence. The long chain of heparin can interact with extended protein sequence. Heparin-binding sites have been structurally mapped on fibronectin, revealing that both type III repeats 12 and 14 are required for complete heparin binding and that the heparin polymer is supposed to span the FN13 and FN14 domains, located 60 Å away in the three-dimensional structure (27Sharma A. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The maximum distance from Lys905 to Arg921 in the collagen V molecule is ∼45 Å, indicating that 12–16 saccharide units are required for optimal binding. Collagens V and XI share common structural and biological features, although their tissue distribution is different (5Fichard A. Kleman J.-P. Ruggiero F. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 515-536Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The most common chain association for collagen XI is the heterotrimer α1(XI) α2(XI) α1(II). However, likely due to their highly identity, the α1(V) and α1(XI) chains can substitute for each other to form heterotypic molecules. Indeed, collagen V chains can assemble with the α1(XI) chains and form a stable molecule ((α1(XI))2 α2(V)) described in bone (28Niyibizi C. Eyre D.R Matrix. 1989; 242: 314-318Google Scholar) and vitreous (29Mayne R. Brewton R.G. Mayne P.M. Baker J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9381-9386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) tissues and in the A204 rabdomyosarcoma cell line (30Kleman J.-P. Hartmann D.J. Ramirez F. van der Rest M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One interesting characteristic common to α1 (V), α1(XI), and α2(XI) chains, but not to α2(V) and α3(V) chains, is the capacity to bind heparin under physiological conditions (11Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Mizuno K. Hayashi T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31Smith G.N. Brandt K.D. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the binding sites on collagen XI chains have not been identified so far. Owing to the high homology among the three α1(V), α1(XI), and α2(XI) chains, alignment of the heparin-binding site was previously proposed and showed that the basic residues from Arg900 to Arg924 are well conserved in the human protein sequences (5Fichard A. Kleman J.-P. Ruggiero F. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 515-536Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This alignment thus could not reveal more information regarding the residues directly involved in heparin binding, and our data were really determinant in unraveling them. Inspection of the corresponding sequences of the α2(V) and α3(V) chains that do not bind heparin was more informative. Indeed, on one hand, alignment of the α2(V) chain with the α1(V) chain showed that the net positive charge of the α2(V)-facing sequence is greatly reduced (+2 instead of +7 for α1(V)) and that all basic residues shown in this report to be involved in binding are not conserved (Fig. 5). This corroborates our experimental data. On the other hand, the corresponding region of α3(V), now available (32Inamura Y. Scott I.C. Greenspan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8749-8759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), was aligned with the α1(V) chain heparin-binding domain (Fig. 5). This chain, supposed to be closely related to the α1(V) chain, has no heparin affinity, as mentioned above. Indeed, the alignment shows a notable reduction in the net positive charge of α3(V) versus α1(V) sequences (e.g. +5/+7). However, Arg912, Arg918, and Arg921 are surprisingly perfectly conserved in the human α3(V) chain. The main difference consists of substitutions of Lys905 and Arg909 by glutamine and glutamate, respectively, which highlighted their crucial role in binding (Fig. 5). The replacement of the lysine residue by glutamine is not drastic since this residue is uncharged, but still has polar character. This suggests that the role of Lys905 in heparin binding is perhaps more important than predicted from the alanine mutagenesis data. Basic residues are present in the α3(V) sequence next to the position of the substituted lysine, increasing the net positive charge of the sequence, but apparently without any effect on heparin binding. This is consistent with the idea that electrostatic interactions by themselves are probably not sufficient for specific heparin binding. Overall, our data fit a model whereby a tight and specific binding is more dependent on strategically positioned basic residues than on electrostatic interaction between a positively charged cluster and the anionic heparin. A novel sequence motif is thus described for heparin binding. Based on the data, we propose that residues including Lys905 might form a primary recognition site for heparin that allows the heparin molecule to subsequently interact with additional basic residues such as Arg912, Arg918, and Arg921 to reinforce the initial binding. The results provide a satisfying explanation for the capacity of the collagen V chains to bind heparin that is consistent with the different affinities observed for the three known collagen V chain associations. It becomes evident that through combinatorial chain associations, the affinity of heparin/heparan sulfate for a given collagen V molecule can be suited to its physiological role in tissues. The identification of the heparin-binding site in this study will clearly help future investigation on molecular mechanisms whereby heparan sulfate proteoglycans interact with collagen V molecules.

https://openalex.org/W2020285135,"The DNA binding domain of GATA-1 consists of two adjacent homologous zinc fingers, of which only the C-terminal finger binds DNA independently. Solution structure studies have shown that the DNA is bent by about 15° in the complex formed with the single C-terminal finger of GATA-1. The N-terminal finger stabilizes DNA binding at some sites. To determine whether it contributes to DNA bending, we have performed circular permutation DNA bending experiments with a variety of DNA-binding sites recognized by GATA-1. By using a series of full-length GATA-1, double zinc finger, and single C-terminal finger constructs, we show that GATA-1 bends DNA by about 24°, irrespective of the DNA-binding site. We propose that the N- and C-terminal fingers of GATA-1 adopt different orientations when bound to different cognate DNA sites. Furthermore, we characterize circular permutation bending artifacts arising from the reduced gel mobility of the protein-DNA complexes. The DNA binding domain of GATA-1 consists of two adjacent homologous zinc fingers, of which only the C-terminal finger binds DNA independently. Solution structure studies have shown that the DNA is bent by about 15° in the complex formed with the single C-terminal finger of GATA-1. The N-terminal finger stabilizes DNA binding at some sites. To determine whether it contributes to DNA bending, we have performed circular permutation DNA bending experiments with a variety of DNA-binding sites recognized by GATA-1. By using a series of full-length GATA-1, double zinc finger, and single C-terminal finger constructs, we show that GATA-1 bends DNA by about 24°, irrespective of the DNA-binding site. We propose that the N- and C-terminal fingers of GATA-1 adopt different orientations when bound to different cognate DNA sites. Furthermore, we characterize circular permutation bending artifacts arising from the reduced gel mobility of the protein-DNA complexes. double-stranded DNA glutathione S-transferase maltose-binding protein polymerase chain reaction DNA-binding zinc fingers of the form CXXC-X 17-CNAC characterize the GATA family of transcription factors. GATA-1, the original member of the family, possesses two such zinc fingers. The C-terminal finger, accompanied by a basic linker region, is both necessary and sufficient for binding to the GATA recognition sequence, WGATAR (1Tsai S.-F. Martin D.I. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D.

Even though the N-terminal finger does not bind DNA independently, it does stabilize GATA-1 interactions with some sites crucial for gene expression (7Martin D.I. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 8Evans T. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Tsai S.F. Strauss E.

These high affinity DNA sites are usually characterized by double GATA motifs, albeit arranged in diverse orientations and spacing. Since GATA-1 binds as a monomer to such sites, it has been proposed that both the N- and C-terminal fingers are involved in DNA recognition. Among these sites is an overlapping palindromic GATA sequence (ATCTGATA, referred to as GATApal) that is necessary for the activity of at least three vertebrate hematopoietic GATA-1 promoters and requires both zinc fingers for high affinity interaction (11Trainor C.D. Omichinski J.G. Vandergon T.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Similarly, both zinc fingers of GATA-1 are requisite for the interaction with the double AGATA sites of the γ-globin promoter (7Martin D.I. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In the accompanying article (12Trainor C. Ghirlando R. Simpson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we show that both the N- and C-terminal fingers of GATA-1 are necessary for the high affinity recognition of the overlapping AGATA sites of the ε-globin silencer (12Trainor C. Ghirlando R. Simpson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We also present similar results for an alternative binding site that contains a GATC consensus sequence. Solution NMR studies of the complex formed between the C-terminal finger of GATA-1 and its cognate DNA sequence indicate that the DNA is bent by an overall angle of about 15° (3Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). This kink probably results from the insertion of the C-terminal basic residues required for DNA binding (5Yang H.Y. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 6Omichinski J.G. Trainor C. Evans T. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1676-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) into the minor groove. Unlike the single C-terminal zinc finger, it has been proposed that the full-length chicken GATA-1 introduces a bend of the order of 64° when bound to the chicken GATA-1 promoter (13Schwartzbauer G. Schlesinger K. Evans T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4429-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for the N-terminal finger in the overall DNA bend induced by the full-length protein. Indeed, the double finger peptide of GATA-1 interacts with DNA probes containing double sites to yield fast and slow migrating 1:1 complexes. Based on a mutational analysis it has been proposed that the slow migrating complex is indicative of binding through only the C-terminal finger (11Trainor C.D. Omichinski J.G. Vandergon T.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The migration anomalies observed may therefore be due to the introduction of bends into the DNA target by the binding of the N-terminal finger. In order to evaluate the contribution of the N-terminal finger to DNA bending, we have performed gel mobility shift assays using circularly permuted probes containing different double and single GATA-binding motifs. By using various GATA-1 constructs we show that the C-terminal finger is the sole contributor to DNA bending and that the bend angle previously reported to be induced by full-length GATA-1 was overestimated. Because the bend angle is identical among double GATA sites separated by 0–9 base pairs, we propose that the N- and C-terminal fingers of GATA-1 necessarily adopt different relative orientations when bound to distinct cognate double GATA sites. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The EcoRV (GATATC) andBglII (AGATCT) restriction sites on pBEND5 (14Zweib C. Adhya S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 30: 281-294PubMed Google Scholar) were modified into SfcI (CTCGAG) and BsrI (ACCAGT) sites, respectively, to remove potential GATA-binding sites. Furthermore, the central SalI (GTCGAC)-cloning site was modified into an AatII (GACGTC) site. The modified pBEND5, pB5RG, was prepared sequentially via pB5R. pB5R was prepared by insertion of the modified dsDNA1 containing the circularly permuted restriction sites into pBEND5 digested withEcoRI and XbaI; pB5RG was prepared by insertion of a similar dsDNA into pB5R digested with XbaI andHindIII (Fig. 1). Bending vectors containing various double and single GATA-binding sites (TableII) were prepared in a similar fashion. dsDNA oligomers spanning theXbaI and HindIII sites of pB5RG containing the binding sites were inserted into pB5R digested with XbaI andHindIII. Each of the bending vector constructs was verified by DNA sequencing (dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing followed by analysis on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer).Table IIGATA-binding sites incorporated into pB5RGPlasmidInsert nameSequence (XbaI-insert-AatII)2-aFlanking partial sequences of the central XbaI and AatII restriction sites are shown in italics.

The maltose-binding protein (MBP) N-terminal fusions to human GATA-1 DF, chicken GATA-1 DF, and chicken GATA-1 CF were expressed in TB1 Escherichia coli. The cells were grown at 37 °C in rich medium with glucose containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μm Zn(OAc)2 and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Approximately 30 g of cells (from a 4-liter culture) were lysed in 80 ml of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μmpepstatin A by sonication. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and loaded on a Q-Sepharose® Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. The flow-through and rinse were combined and loaded on an S-Sepharose® Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 0.0–1.0 mNaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mmEDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was used to elute the MBP GATA-1 protein. GATA-1 protein activity was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay; the fractions were pooled, adjusted to 10% glycerol (v/v), and stored at −80 °C. The double zinc finger domain of chicken GATA-1 was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μm Zn(OAc)2. Expression and purification were carried out as described above. Peptides corresponding to the human GATA-1 double finger and chicken GATA-1 C-terminal single finger were prepared as described previously (6Omichinski J.G. Trainor C. Evans T. Gronenborn A.M.

Full-length GATA-1 nuclear extracts were made by standard procedures from adult chicken erythrocytes (17Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9147) Google Scholar). Radioactively labeled, circularly permuted probes were prepared by PCR amplification of theEcoRI to HindIII portion of the pB5RG vector and restriction enzyme treatment as described (18Sharrocks A.D. Shore P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2442-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out using CCCGGGCTGCAGGAATTCACG and GACGGTATGCATAAGCTTGGA as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Restriction digests to yield the circularly permuted products were performed with BsrI,NheI, ClaI, SpeI, DraI,MspI, NruI, KpnI, HinfI, and BamHI. The DNA probes were gel-purified on 5% native acrylamide gels and adjusted to the same concentration based on their specific activity. Each reaction (10 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 ng of bovine serum albumin, 0.125% Triton X-100, and 4% Ficoll) contained 20–40 ng of labeled DNA, 500 ng poly(dI·dC), 500 ng of a cold pB5RG competitor containing no GATA sites prepared by PCR in addition to 2–4 μl of the GATA-1 protein preparation. The reactions were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels at 13 V/cm in 10 mm Tris base, 10 mm Hepes, and 1 mmEDTA at room temperature. 10.2, 7.8, 6.0, and 4.2% gels were electrophoresed for 14, 6, 3 and 1.5 h, respectively. The gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 30 min, dried, and autoradiographed. Competition experiments demonstrated that the complexes formed were specific GATA-1 and DNA complexes. Bending experiments with probes based on the bent pB5RG-A5 and pB5RG-A55 were carried out in a similar fashion using probes derived from pB5RG-G3 as a linear reference. The reactions contained approximately equal quantities of either the bent or linear probes. Gels were analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using ImageQuant 4.1. The mobilities of the protein-DNA complexes (or bent DNA) were normalized to the mobility of the free (or linear) DNA (Rbound/Rfree) and fitted to a second order polynomial of D/L to determine a, b,and c (SigmaPlot 5.0, SPSS Inc.) as shown in Equation1, Rbound/Rfree=a(D/L)2−b(D/L)+cEquation 1 where L represents the length of the probe andD the distance of the GATA-binding site from the 5′ end of the DNA molecule (19Ferrari S. Harley V.R. Pontiggia A. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The angle, θ, obtained from Equation 2, cos(θ)=(a/2c)−1Equation 2 cos(θ)=(−b/2c)−1yielded the bending angle α = 180° − θ as described (19Ferrari S. Harley V.R. Pontiggia A. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Excellent quadratic fits were obtained in all cases studied, and the two values of θ for each fit were identical, within the precision of the method. Control bending experiments were carried out with a GATA-palindrome site fused to the A5 A-tract (Table I) which has an intrinsic bend of 20° (Fig. 3 B) as follows:AGAAGTCCATCTGATAAGACTTGGCCACGCAAAAACGGCAAAAACGGCAAAAACGGTCGAGACZ.A visual inspection of the Rbound/Rfree data shows that GATA-1 double finger binding does not bend DNA significantly. A fit to the quadratic equation leads to an angle of 10 ± 3°, representing a lower limit angle that can be determined in this fashion. The bend introduced by the GATA-1 double finger binding is presumably out of phase with that of the A5 A-tract, resulting in an overall decrease of the bending angle. Gel mobility shift assays using circularly permuted probes containing varying GATA-binding motifs (Table II) were carried out to determine the bend angle introduced by both chicken and human double zinc finger peptides. The GATA-binding sites evaluated consisted of a series of double sites separated by 0 (GATApal (G2)), 1 (ε-globin silencer (εS) and GATC consensus site (GC)), 4 (GATA-1 promoter (G3)), or 9 (γ-globin promoter (γP)) base pairs, allowing us to evaluate how the combination of the two zinc fingers may contribute to the overall bend. It has already been shown that both the zinc fingers of GATA-1 interact with DNA when bound to the G2 and γP sites (7Martin D.I. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 11Trainor C.D. Omichinski J.G. Vandergon T.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we show that the same holds true for the εS and GC-binding sites. In addition to these double GATA sites, two single GATA-binding sites were analyzed in order to evaluate the contribution of the C-terminal finger to the overall DNA bend. One site (G1) represents the doubly mutated mouse GATA-1 promoter site, whereas the other (G0) is the consensus site used in obtaining the solution structure of the DNA complex formed with the C-terminal finger (6Omichinski J.G. Trainor C. Evans T. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1676-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Circular permutation bending experiments carried out with the human and chicken double finger peptides show, within the experimental precision of the method, that the DNA bend induced by 1:1 complex formation is independent of the GATA-binding site. The average bend angle of 24 ± 3° obtained for these complexes is identical to the average bending angle obtained with the chicken C-terminal finger peptide (Table III). These data demonstrate that GATA-1 bends DNA in a site-independent manner and that this bend arises solely from the binding of the C-terminal finger of GATA-1 to the DNA (Table III, sites G1 and G0).Table IIIGATA-1 bends DNA in a site-independent mannerPB5RG probesGST c GATA-1MBP-hDFChicken GATA-1Human DFChicken DFChicken CFγP97 ± 461 ± 429 ± 326 ± 2ɛS107 ± 264 ± 422 ± 4G3102 ± 887 ± 359 ± 426 ± 219 ± 323 ± 4G2109 ± 681 ± 667 ± 425 ± 320 ± 216 ± 2G186 ± 925 ± 224 ± 226 ± 2G081 ± 524 ± 223 ± 222 ± 3GC28 ± 3Average104 ± 683 ± 363 ± 425 ± 224 ± 423 ± 4Values of the bending angles (°) obtained by circular permutation analysis as a function of GATA-binding sites shown in Table II.

Open table in a new tab Values of the bending angles (°) obtained by circular permutation analysis as a function of GATA-binding sites shown in Table II. The angles represent the average of at least three experiments, and the error represents the S.E. of the mean. Experiments were also carried out for the MBP-cDF and MBP-cCF fusion proteins. Within the error of the method, angles independent of the DNA-binding sites were observed. Average angles of 76 ± 8 and 88 ± 10 ° were obtained for the MBP-cDF and MBP-cCF, respectively. The bend angle of 24° is significantly different from the value of 64° published for the full-length chicken GATA-1 (13Schwartzbauer G. Schlesinger K. Evans T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4429-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and we have just shown that this difference cannot be ascribed to the contribution of the N-terminal finger. To explain this difference we performed a series of circular permutation mobility shift assays with full-length chicken GATA-1 obtained from chicken erythrocytes. Data obtained for the 1:1 complex formed with sites from the mouse GATA-1 promoter (Table III, site G3, essentially identical to the chicken GATA-1 promoter used in Ref. 13Schwartzbauer G. Schlesinger K. Evans T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4429-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) lead to an angle of 59 ± 4° (Fig.2), a value identical to that previously published. As in the case of the double and single C-terminal finger peptides, the angle was site-independent. Circular permutation experiments were also carried out with an MBP fusion to the human double finger. As in the case of the double finger peptide, the bending angle obtained did not depend on the binding site. Unlike the peptide, however, an average bending angle of 83 ± 3° is noted (TableIII). Similar experiments carried out with a bacterially expressed GST fusion to the full-length chicken GATA-1 lead to a larger bending anglevis-à-vis the chicken GATA-1 (i.e. 104°versus 63°; Table III). As neither the GST nor the MBP domains interact with DNA, these data indicate that the 63° bend observed with GATA-1 includes a contribution resulting from the decreased migration of the 1:1 complex. Indeed, a plot of the bending angle (α) as a function of the relative mobility of the complex (Rbound/Rfree) suggests a direct relation between these parameters (Fig.3 A). In the reptation model describing DNA migration through a gel, it is assumed that the presence of a single intrinsic bend imposes a large barrier to the motion of the DNA chain. Furthermore, it is assumed that the elastic force constant, B eff, describing the “interaction” of the DNA chain with the acrylamide pores does not change within a particular set of probes (20Levene S.D. Zimm B.H. Science. 1989; 245: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Measuring the bending angle as a function of the acrylamide concentration readily tests this assumption, which is critical to the derivation of the quadratic equation relating mobility to bending. Bending of the mouse GATA-1 promoter (G3) by the double finger peptide of chicken GATA-1 leads to bending angles that are slightly dependent on the acrylamide concentration in a manner similar to the A-tracts used as controls (Fig. 3 B). This slight variation in the angle is therefore an intrinsic DNA property. However, both the full-length GATA-1 and the MBP-chicken double finger lead to bending angles that show a marked dependence on the acrylamide concentration (Fig.3 B). In these cases, the elastic force constant of the complex varies as a function of the circularly permuted probe, leading to an overestimation of the true bend angle. Therefore, together with the observation that the double and single C-terminal zinc finger peptides lead to identical bending angles, we conclude that GATA-1 bends DNA by 24° in a site-independent manner. We have shown that the GATA-1 proteins bend DNA by 24° in a site-independent manner and that the C-terminal finger is sufficient to account for this bend. The NMR solution structure of the C-terminal finger peptide bound to G0 DNA shows a kink of about 15° in the direction of the major groove. It was proposed that the C-terminal basic arm required for binding (5Yang H.Y. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 6Omichinski J.G. Trainor C. Evans T. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1676-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) is solely responsible for this bend (3Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The site independence of the induced angle shown here by circular permutation analysis confirms this hypothesis. The N-terminal finger of GATA-1 does not possess a basic arm, and the bending angle induced by GATA-1 is not affected by the presence of N-finger binding sites. As both N- and C-terminal fingers simultaneously bind to a variety of double GATA sites (Table II), any finger-finger interactions are necessarily constrained by their relative orientations and distance as little DNA bending is induced by either zinc finger. DNA bending angles determined by circular permutation analysis represent a sum of the contributions of the true bend and the migration anomaly produced by the structure of the protein-DNA complex. Indeed, it has been documented that circular permutation analysis usually overestimates the bend angle induced by DNA-binding proteins (21Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 22Hagerman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9993-9996Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For example, bending angles of 81° were obtained with this method for the thyroid hormone and retinoid X receptor dimers (TR/TR and TR/RXR) (23Shulemovich K. Dimaculangan D.D. Katz D. Lazar M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A large contribution to this bend must be due to anomalous migration as phasing analysis leads to induced bends of about 10° (23Shulemovich K. Dimaculangan D.D. Katz D.

Similar conclusions have been reached in a study of the GCN4-DNA complex, where it was shown that the full-length GCN4 leads to an anomalous circular permutation analysis due to its size (24Gartenberg M.R. Ampe C. Steitz T.A. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6034-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In a comparative study we have shown that the non-bending migration anomaly, due in part to “trailing” portions of the protein, contributes significantly to the apparent bending angle in the case of the full-length GATA-1, the MBP, and GST fusion proteins (Fig.3 A). Because their apparent bending angles vary significantly as a function of the acrylamide concentration, the angles consequently are not a reflection of the true bend induced. In the accompanying article (12Trainor C. Ghirlando R. Simpson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) we demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal zinc fingers of GATA-1 influence one another in DNA binding. This change is most likely the result of an intramolecular interaction between the GATA fingers and (or) linkers. Indeed, it has been shown that GATA-1 dimerizes with low affinity on DNA. This occurs through an association between the N- and C-terminal zinc fingers of separate molecules, indicating that the fingers associate specifically with one another (25Mackay J.P. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Czolij R. King G.F. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30560-30567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For similar interactions to occur intramolecularly, the fingers must be capable of movement relative to one another through the amino acids linking them. This linker region of GATA-1 has recently been shown by NMR to have little secondary structure and is therefore likely to allow sufficient movement of the fingers relative to each other (26Kowalski K. Czolij R. King G.F. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As the DNA is apparently unconstrained by the orientations of the two zinc fingers, the bending experiments support a model in which the N- and C-terminal zinc fingers adopt different geometries when bound to different double GATA sites.

Using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies, we observed that FcεRI activation in these cells led to an increase in FAK phosphorylation at the same tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated by integrin-induced activation. Previous studies in the 3B6 line, a FAK-deficient variant of the RBL-2H3 cells, suggest that FAK plays a role in FcεRI-induced secretion. Stable cell lines expressing either full-length or truncated forms of FAK were isolated after transfection of the FAK-deficient 3B6 variant cells. The NH2 domain of FAK, which lacks the enzymatic and the COOH-terminal regions, was sufficient to reconstitute secretion. The different truncated forms of FAK were still tyrosine-phosphorylated after FcεRI aggregation. Therefore, the kinase domain and the COOH-terminal region are not essential for FcεRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK or for secretion. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the reconstitution of secretion is dissociated from FAK activation and that the NH2-terminal region of FAK is the only critical element that may play a role in FcεRI-induced secretion by acting as an adaptor or linker molecule.

Integrin-dependent adhesion triggers the activation of a complex signaling cascade that functions to control cell morphogenesis, migration, and proliferation (1Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). A number of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK)1 are involved in integrin-regulated signaling. Among them, the focal adhesion kinase FAK colocalizes with focal adhesions and is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon cell adherence on fibronectin (2Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). In various cell types, FAK functions in transmitting an integrin-dependent signal, leading to the control of cell motility, cell adherence, cell proliferation, or the prevention of cells from activating the apoptosis process (3Illc D.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1461-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Recently, a homologue of FAK, Dfak56, has been identified in Drosophila melanogaster (6Fox G.L. Rebay I. Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14978-14983Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Palmer R.H. Fessler L.I. Edeen P.T. Madigan S.J. McKeown M. Hunter T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29196-29201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Dfak56 is expressed where Drosophila position-specific integrins are located and activated upon cell adherence, thus confirming the role of FAK in integrin-mediated signaling. Mammalian FAK is a 125-kDa non-receptor PTK, which has large NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions flanking the central catalytic domain (for review see Ref. 9Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar and Fig.1). The COOH-terminal region of FAK can bind a number of cytoskeletal and signaling molecules, which become tyrosine-phosphorylated after integrin activation. This region contains the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) sequence, which interacts with talin and paxillin and is thought to be essential for the activation and translocation of FAK to focal adhesion sites (10Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain of FAK also contains two proline-rich regions, which bind SH3-containing molecules, including the GTPase regulator associated with FAK (Graf) (11Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) or P130Cas (12Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), the latter being involved in the activation of JNK MAP kinases. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the COOH-terminal region generates binding sites for SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules such as the Shc·Grb2 complex, leading to the activation of the Ras-Erk MAP kinase pathway (13Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 14Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). In contrast, the function of the large NH2-terminal domain of FAK remains unclear. This domain, by directly or indirectly interacting with integrins, may regulate the adherence-induced FAK activation (15Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal region of FAK also contains the tyrosine residue Tyr397, which is critical for FAK activation. Clustering of β integrin is thought to enhance the phosphorylation of Tyr397, via an autophosphorylation process. Phosphorylated Tyr397 then recruits Src family kinases, which phosphorylate other sites on FAK such as Tyr407 in the NH2-terminal region, Tyr576 and Tyr577 in the activation loop (leading to an increase in FAK enzymatic activity) (16Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Tyr861 (17Calalb M.B. Zhang X.E. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and Tyr925 (potential Grb2 binding site) in the COOH-terminal region (14Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated Tyr397 can also bind and activate other signaling molecules, including PTEN (18Tamura M. Gu J.G.

On basophils or mast cells, the aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptors (FcεRI) initiates biochemical events that result in degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators, like histamine or serotonin. The activation of FcεRI also increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, a mast cell line that has been extensively used to study FcεRI-mediated secretion (23Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor-induced phosphorylation of FAK and secretion from these cells are enhanced by adherence of the cells to fibronectin (23Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hamawy M.M. Oliver C. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 615-621PubMed Google Scholar). To define the role of FAK in secretion, we previously transfected FAK cDNA into a variant of the RBL-2H3 mast cell line (3B6 cells) that expressed low levels of this kinase and had decreased FcεRI-mediated but not Ca2+ ionophore-mediated secretion (25Hamawy M.M. Swieter M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30498-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We observed that (i) FcεRI-induced histamine release is reconstituted in the 3B6 cells that expressed increased levels of wild type FAK, (ii) histamine release is also enhanced by the stable expression of two mutants of FAK: a kinase-inactive form in which the ATP binding site Lys454 is replaced by Arg or a mutant in which the Tyr397 autophosphorylation site is replaced by Phe, indicating that the catalytic activity and the autophosphorylation site of FAK are not essential for secretion (25Hamawy M.M. Swieter M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30498-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). FcεRI aggregation increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of both mutants of FAK to the same extent as did wild type FAK, indicating that other tyrosine kinases activated by FcεRI aggregation are phosphorylating FAK and some of these phosphorylation sites, which might interact with SH2-containing adaptor molecules, are other than Tyr397. This also suggests that the FcεRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK is independent of a functional autophosphorylation site. To better understand how FAK modulates degranulation, we expressed different truncated forms of the molecule in the FAK-deficient 3B6 cells. We also used phosphorylation site-specific antibodies to examine the phosphorylation of FAK in these cells. Our results show that the NH2-terminal region of FAK was critical and substantial enough to reconstitute IgE-induced secretion in the 3B6 cells and that the kinase domain and the COOH-terminal region were not required to reconstitute degranulation. These results suggest that the role of FAK in secretion is unrelated to its activation and suggest that the NH2-terminal region of FAK has a major role in the regulation of some in vivo cell functions. Full-length mouse FAK cDNA was generously provided by Dr. S. Hanks (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). The pBS was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the pSVL was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). A pBluescript vector containing the hemagglutinin sequence was kindly provided by Dr. Nicholas Ryba (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health). The pSV2-hph containing the hygromycin resistance gene and pSV2-Neo expressing the neomycin resistance gene were from ATCC (Rockville, MD). FAK monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratory (Lexington, KY). Anti-FAK rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the COOH-terminal region of FAK was from Labvision Neomarkers (Fremont, CA), and the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Phosphorylation state site-specific FAK antibodies were purchased from BIOSOURCEInternational Inc. (Camarillo, CA). All other materials were obtained as described previously (26Basciano L.K. Berenstein E.H. Kmak L. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11823-11831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length and the different truncated forms of FAK (Fig. 1) were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using Vent polymerase and the full-length FAK cDNA plasmid. The primers used were the following for full-length FAK (P1): 5′-TTG GTA CCG GGC CCT CTA GAA TGG CAG CTG CTT ATC TTG AC (containing KpnI and XbaI sites) and (P2): 5′-AGT GTG GCC GTG TCT GCC CTA G-3′. The COOH-terminal-deleted FAK product was obtained by using primers (P1) and 5′-ACC GTT CTT CTT GCT GCA CC-3′; NH2-terminal region of FAK with primers (P1) and 5′-AAT AAT CCC TGG TCG AGG GC-3′; NH2-terminal-deleted FAK with primers (P2) and 5′-TTG GTA CCG GGC CCT CTA GAC ACC ATG CCC TCG ACC AGG G-3′. FRNK was obtained by using primers (P2) and 5′-TTG GTA CCG GGC CCT CTA GAC ACC ATG GAA TCC AGA AGA CAG GC-3′. The hemagglutinin sequence was inserted into the pBluescript plasmid SK−between the EcoRV and BamHI sites. This plasmid (pBS-HA) was digested with EcoRV and KpnI. To add the HA-tagged sequence to each form of FAK, the polymerase chain reaction products were digested with KpnI and ligated into the pBS-HA plasmid. After verification of the constructs by DNA sequencing, the pBS plasmids containing the different FAK HA-cDNA sequences were digested with XbaI and BamHI and subcloned into the pSVL expression vector. RBL-2H3 cells have been characterized previously (27Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The RBL-2H3 cells were maintained in complete medium (Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine, and antibiotic-antimycotic mixture) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The 3B6 cells were identified previously as cells in which the expression of FAK is 16 ± 9% as much as in the parental RBL-2H3 cells (25Hamawy M.M. Swieter M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30498-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This cell line is resistant to G418 and is defective for FcεRI-mediated secretion, although release with the Ca2+ionophore is similar to that in the parental wild type cells. The 3B6 cells were cultured in complete medium containing 300 μg/ml (active concentration) of G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The monolayer cells were dissociated with 0.05% trypsin/0.53 mm EDTA and subcultured two to three times a week. The pSVL plasmids containing the cDNAs for wild type or variant forms of FAK and the pSV2-hph plasmid containing the hygromycin resistance gene were linearized. The expression vector and pSV2-hph plasmid at a ratio of 10:1 (55 μg total) were incubated with 3B6 cells (5 × 106) for 10 min on ice. After electroporation (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 960 microfarads, 310 millivolts, in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, the cells were kept on ice for 10 min, and aliquots (5 × 105 cells) were transferred to ten 100-mm diameter tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ). Selection (1.2 mg/ml hygromycin) was started 48 h after the transfection. Clones were identified, isolated using cloning rings, and expanded for testing. To transfect FRNK in RBL-2H3 cells, the pSV2-Neo plasmid expressing the neomycin resistance gene and pSVL plasmid containing FRNK were linearized and cotransfected (ratio 1:20) by electroporation into RBL-2H3 cells. Stable transfected clones were selected with 500 μg/ml active G418, and cell lines were screened for the expression of FRNK. All transfected cell lines were screened by immunoblotting, and 10 lines were further expanded that expressed truncated or wild type FAK. Briefly, cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in 24-well tissue culture plates (105 cells/well) and sensitized by culture with the anti-trinitrophenol-specific IgE. The following day, cells were washed two times in Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's balanced salt solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin plus Tris, 10 mm, pH 7.4. After the last wash, the cells were stimulated in this media with several concentrations of the antigen (Ag) dinitrophenol coupled to human serum albumin (48 molecules of dinitrophenol per molecule of human serum albumin) or with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. After 45-min incubation at 37 °C, the supernatant was collected and analyzed for histamine as described previously (28Siraganian R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 57: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting of whole cell lysates, monolayer cells (105/well) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and immediately lysed with hot sample buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol). The cell lysates were boiled, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Novex, San Diego, CA), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blotted with the indicated antibodies. For the immunoprecipitation of FRNK, 5 × 106 cells were lysed in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 unit/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and mixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 3 μg of the anti-FAK mAb (clone 2A7; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) bound to 10 μg of rabbit anti-mouse Ig that had been preincubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein A-agarose (Sigma, St Louis, MO). For immunoprecipitation of full-length FAK and the variant form ΔC-FAK, 5 × 106 cells were lysed with 1% hot SDS containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and 10 mmTris, pH 7.4. After boiling for 30 min, the lysates were diluted 1:10 with ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer and mixed for 2 h at 4 °C with 2.5 μg of the anti-FAK mAb (Transduction Laboratory), which was bound to 10 μg of rabbit anti-mouse Ig that had been preincubated with protein A-agarose. For immunoprecipitation of the truncated forms N-FAK and ΔN-FAK, lysates from 5 × 106 cells, prepared and boiled as described above, were diluted 1:10 with ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) directly coupled to protein A-agarose beads. For all immunoprecipitation experiments, the cell lysates were incubated with the beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After three washes in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer, the beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The proteins in the eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blotted with the indicated antibodies. In all blots, proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance). In fibroblasts and other cell types, FAK activation by integrins leads to the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue Tyr397, the autophosphorylation site. Once this site is phosphorylated, it becomes the binding site for Src family kinases, which then phosphorylate FAK on other tyrosine residues, including Tyr407 in the NH2 domain, Tyr577 in the activation loop, and several sites in the COOH-terminal domain, including Tyr861 (16Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Calalb M.B. Zhang X.E. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 29Ruest P.J. Roy S. Shi E.G. Mernaugh R.L. Hanks S.K. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 41-48PubMed Google Scholar). We previously found that the aggregation of the IgE receptor in RBL-2H3 cells induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, which was enhanced by cell adherence (23Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To verify whether this FcεRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation corresponds to FAK activation, we used phosphospecific antibodies, which selectively recognize the autophosphorylation and Src-phosphorylated sites on the FAK molecule. The culture of the RBL-2H3 cells as monolayers induced phosphorylation of Tyr397, Tyr577, and Tyr861 in quiescent cells (Fig. 2). Aggregation of the IgE receptor dramatically increased the phosphorylation of the residues Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr577, and Tyr861. Therefore, in RBL-2H3 cells FAK was activated in resting cells, probably by cell adherence, and FcεRI activation led to an increase in FAK phosphorylation at the same sites that are known to be phosphorylated after integrin-induced activation. In 3B6 cells, a variant form of RBL-2H3 cells that is defective in IgE-induced secretion and expresses low levels of FAK, transfection of the wild type FAK, the kinase-inactive form of FAK (ATP-binding site mutated), or FAK mutated on the autophosphorylation site reconstituted the antigen-induced secretion, indicating that FAK plays a role as an adaptor molecule (25Hamawy M.M. Swieter M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30498-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal region of FAK seemed to be a good candidate for a potential role in the modulation of IgE-induced secretion, because it can bind a number of cytoskeletal and signaling molecules such as paxillin (9Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IgE aggregation induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in RBL-2H3 cells (30Hamawy M.M. Swaim W.D. Minoguchi K. de Feijter A.W. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4655-4662PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the COOH-terminal region of FAK regulated IgE-induced secretion, we transfected RBL-2H3 cells with FRNK, the FAK-related non-kinase, which corresponds to the COOH-terminal region of the FAK molecule (see Fig. 1). FRNK is expressed endogenously in fibroblasts (31Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and is an inhibitor of FAK function (32Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), probably by competing for the binding of FAK to cytoskeletal elements. Expression of FRNK in cells has been reported to decrease FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and FAK-dependent cellular functions, including cell adherence (4Maung K. Easty D.J. Hill S.P. Bennett D.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6824-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), cell spreading (32Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), or migration (33Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By transfection FRNK was expressed in RBL-2H3 cell lines at levels that by immunoblotting appeared to be higher than endogenous FAK (Fig.3 A). The cell lines expressing FRNK were still adherent and grew as monolayers, but there was some decrease in cell spreading in several of the transfected cloned lines (data not shown). To further verify the functional effects of FRNK in RBL-2H3 cells, we tested the IgE-induced FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. FRNK transfection resulted in strong inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and of the Tyr397autophosphorylation site in both resting and FcεRI-activated cells (Fig. 3 B). Although FRNK is phosphorylated on serine residues via a signaling pathway involving PKA activation in chicken embryo fibroblasts (34Richardson A. Shannon J.D. Adams R.B. Schaller M.D. Parsons T. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether it can be tyrosine-phosphorylated. We next immunoprecipitated FRNK from resting and antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Surprisingly, FRNK was tyrosine-phosphorylated in resting cells (using a longer exposure of the film, data not shown), and FcεRI aggregation increased this phosphorylation (Fig.3 C). Because FRNK was tyrosine-phosphorylated and was effective in modulating FAK phosphorylation in these cells, we next examined IgE-induced secretion. After stimulation with optimal concentrations of antigen, the average histamine release in the 10 different cell lines transfected with FRNK was 41.2% ± 8% compared with 43% ± 4% in the parental cells (mean ± S.D.,n = 5), indicating that FRNK did not affect secretion. Therefore, although FRNK decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, it did not modify the release of histamine. Previously we reported that transfection of full-length FAK in the secretion-deficient 3B6 cells, which express low levels of endogenous FAK, reconstitutes IgE-induced secretion (25Hamawy M.M. Swieter M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30498-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the present experiments we found that transfection of full-length FAK, which had an HA tag was also fully functional (Fig.4 A and see below). To further investigate the role of the COOH-terminal region of FAK in secretion, we stably transfected the COOH-terminal domain-deleted FAK (ΔC-FAK) in the 3B6 cells and clones expressing ΔC-FAK were analyzed for histamine release (Fig. 4 B, cell lines ΔC18 and ΔC20, and data not shown). The ΔC-FAK, like full-length FAK, still reconstituted IgE-induced secretion (Fig.5 A), indicating that the COOH-terminal region of FAK was not required for this function.Figure 5Histamine release from the parental 3B6 cells and 3B6 cell lines expressing the different truncated forms of FAK. A, cells were sensitized overnight with antigen-specific IgE and then stimulated with the indicated concentrations of the antigen dinitrophenol coupled to human serum albumin for 45 min. B, cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Histamine release is expressed as a percentage of total cellular histamine content. The results are the mean ± S.D. from five different cell lines tested for each variant form of FAK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The COOH-terminal domain of FAK contains the FAT sequence (focal adhesion targeting; see Fig. 1), which is thought to play a critical role in the cell-dependent activation of FAK (35Shen Y. Schaller M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2507-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of ΔC-FAK immunoprecipitated from resting and antigen-stimulated cells (Fig.4 C). The ΔC-FAK was tyrosine-phosphorylated in resting cells, and this phosphorylation was increased after antigen stimulation. When analyzed by phosphospecific FAK antibodies, the autophosphorylation site Tyr397 and the Tyr577tyrosine residue in the activation loop were phosphorylated in quiescent cells, and their level of phosphorylation was increased upon IgE receptor activation (although very slightly for Tyr577). These data suggest that ΔC-FAK is activated in resting cells, probably via cell adherence, and FcεRI aggregation augmented this activation. Although the FAT sequence may play a role for optimal FAK activation, it is not absolutely essential for the activation of FAK in mast cells. The kinase domain of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) could play a role as an adaptor or linker molecule (36Zhang J. Kimura T. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4366-4374PubMed Google Scholar). In 3B6 cells, the expression of the kinase-inactive variant form of full-length FAK (ATP-binding site mutated) reconstituted secretion (25Hamawy M.M. Swieter M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30498-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, this does not rule out the potential role of the kinase domain of FAK as an adaptor molecule in the regulation of mast cell secretion. To exclude this possibility, we expressed in 3B6 cells the NH2-terminal region of FAK (N-FAK), which lacks the kinase domain (see Fig. 1). Stable transfected clones were screened for the expression of N-FAK (Fig.6 A, clones N-11 and N-24, and data not shown), and several N-FAK positives clones were tested for histamine release. IgE-induced degranulation was still reconstituted in cell lines expressing N-FAK (Fig. 5 A). N-FAK was tyrosine-phosphorylated in resting cells, and FcεRI activation increased this phosphorylation (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that (i) the presence of the kinase domain in the FAK molecule is not necessary to reconstitute secretion, (ii) the NH2-terminal region of FAK can reconstitute secretion, and (iii) N-FAK is still phosphorylated by other PTKs even in the absence of the autophosphorylation process. To definitively rule out a potential role of either the kinase domain or the COOH-terminal region of FAK in degranulation, the NH2-terminal-deleted FAK (ΔN-FAK, see Fig. 1) was transfected into the 3B6 cells, and several clones stably expressing N-FAK were tested for histamine release (Fig.7 A, clones ΔN-20 and ΔN-22). No significant increase in IgE-induced histamine release could be detected in the lines expressing ΔN-FAK, as compared with the parental 3B6 cells (Fig. 5 A). The ΔN-FAK was tyrosine-phosphorylated in resting cells, and this was slightly increased after IgE receptor aggregation (Fig. 7 B). The tyrosine phosphorylation of ΔN-FAK was in agreement with the observation that FRNK was tyrosine-phosphorylated in RBL-2H3 cells. However, these phosphorylations did not play any role in the degranulation process, because ΔN-FAK did not restore secretion. Altogether the degranulation experiments suggest that: (i) the kinase domain and COOH-terminal region of FAK are not involved in the modulation of secretion, and (ii) the NH2-terminal region is the critical element of the FAK molecule that is essential and sufficient for reconstituting secretion. In this report we examined which domain of FAK may regulate FcεRI-induced secretion in the RBL-2H3 mast cells. By using phosphospecific FAK antibodies, we found that receptor aggregation induced an increase in the phosphorylation on FAK at the same tyrosine residues that are known to be involved in its integrin-induced activation. The low level in the phosphorylation of the Tyr397 autophosphorylation site in resting cells was increased by antigen activation. Furthermore, in agreement with previous reports, which demonstrated that Src family kinases can bind to Tyr397 and then phosphorylate other tyrosine residues on FAK, the tyrosine phosphorylation of several other sites was increased by FcεRI aggregation, including Tyr577 in the activation loop, Tyr407 in the NH2 domain, and Tyr861 in the COOH-terminal region. However, the autophosphorylation site was not essential for FAK phosphorylation. Antigen activation of RBL-2H3 cells expressing FRNK, the COOH-terminal domain of FAK, led to the tyrosine phosphorylation of FRNK. Similarly, the NH2-terminal-deleted FAK expressed in 3B6 cells was also tyrosine-phosphorylated, indicating that tyrosine residues on the COOH-terminal region are still phosphorylated even in the absence of the autophosphorylation site. Nevertheless, the autophosphorylation site was necessary to get an optimal phosphorylation of the FAK molecule. For example, there was much less increase in the phosphorylation levels of Tyr577 and Tyr861 in ΔN-FAK expressed in 3B6 cells than in the endogenous full-length FAK molecule in RBL-2H3 cells (data not shown). These experiments also support our previous observation that autophosphorylation site-mutated FAK expressed in 3B6 cells is still tyrosine-phosphorylated after receptor aggregation (25Hamawy M.M. Swieter M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30498-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although these studies suggest that the tyrosine sites phosphorylated by adhesion and by receptor activation are similar, it is possible that there are other tyrosine residues in the COOH-terminal region (or the kinase domain) that are phosphorylated only following FcεRI aggregation. The COOH-terminal domain of FAK contains the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) sequence, which is critical for cell adhesion-dependent FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (35Shen Y. Schaller M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2507-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we observed that, in these mast cells, ΔC-FAK was tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo and its phosphorylation level increased upon antigen stimulation. In agreement, expression of FRNK in RBL-2H3 cells inhibited partially, but not fully, the IgE-induced FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. These data suggest that the presence of the FAT sequence and the interaction of FAK with cytoskeletal elements are not absolutely critical for FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. However, such interactions probably are required for maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, because FRNK partially inhibited this phosphorylation. The COOH-terminal domain of FAK was not essential for reconstitution of secretion in the 3B6 cells. However, this domain of FAK has been found to be important in many cellular pathways. In various cell types, the COOH-terminal region of FAK is a key component for interaction with downstream signaling molecules such as adaptors and the activation of MAP kinases pathways (37Boudreau J. Jones P.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). This domain of FAK includes the FAT sequence, which is critical for cell adhesion-dependent FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, a proline-rich region that binds SH3-containing molecules and tyrosines that are phosphorylated and bind adaptor-containing molecules such as Grb2. Similarly, expression of FRNK in RBL-2H3 cells, which would have functioned as a competitive inhibitor, did not block histamine release. Therefore, these sites in the COOH-terminal region of FAK, although important for a number of signaling protein interactions, are not required for histamine release. The enzymatic activity of FAK and the kinase domain were not required for the reconstitution of histamine release in the 3B6 cells. We previously observed that the catalytic activity and the autophosphorylation site were not essential for the reconstitution of IgE-induced secretion by full-length FAK. However, because these two mutant forms of FAK were still strongly phosphorylated, FAK could still be activated and/or tyrosine-phosphorylated by another PTK, via a mechanism that would not involve the autophosphorylation site. In the present experiments, the results with the truncated forms of FAK clearly demonstrate that the reconstitution of optimal histamine release in 3B6 cells is totally dissociated from FAK activation. Indeed, we show that (i) FRNK inhibited FAK activation in RBL-2H3 cells but did not block histamine release, (ii) the expression of the NH2-terminal region of FAK in 3B6 cells reconstituted degranulation, and (iii) the COOH-terminal region and the kinase domain could not restore IgE-induced secretion. The NH2-terminal region was the critical domain for the reconstitution of histamine release in the 3B6 cells. This was apparent from the transfection with the different constructs; whereas the NH2 domain alone or together with the enzymatic domain reconstituted secretion, the ΔN-FAK construct, which included the enzymatic and the COOH-terminal regions, was ineffective. The two constructs N-FAK and ΔC-FAK were also tyrosine-phosphorylated in non-stimulated adherent cells, and this phosphorylation was increased after FcεRI aggregation. Thus, independent of FAK activation, some tyrosine residues present in the NH2-terminal region of FAK are still phosphorylated by other protein tyrosine kinases, which are activated by FcεRI stimulation. Furthermore, these phosphorylations occur even in the absence of the FAT sequence and the kinase activity. The mutated forms of FAK that reconstituted IgE-induced degranulation still contained the Tyr397 autophosphorylation site. However, it is unlikely that this Tyr397 site is involved in the modulation of secretion, because (i) the expression of full-length FAK with this site mutated still reconstituted secretion in 3B6 cells (25Hamawy M.M. Swieter M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30498-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and (ii) the COOH-terminal region and the kinase domain, which are tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src family kinases that bind to this site, are not involved in IgE-induced secretion. The mechanism by which the NH2-terminal region of FAK regulates secretion is unclear. Indeed, this domain contains no known protein interaction sequences, and no signaling molecules have been reported that bind to the NH2-terminal part of FAK (if we exclude Tyr397). However, it is possible that this NH2-terminal region plays a role as an adaptor molecule, linking FAK to integrin and/or cytoskeletal changes that are involved in IgE-mediated secretion. The clustering of integrins is thought to lead to the binding of the NH2-terminal domain of FAK to the cytoplasmic tail of β integrins, resulting in FAK oligomerization and activation (9Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 15Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 38Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3757) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that association of N-FAK with integrins could reinforce and stabilize the formation of stable complexes between integrins and other signaling molecules, resulting in enhanced FcεRI-induced secretion. These effects could be similar to the enhanced degranulation observed in adherent compared with non-adherent RBL-2H3 cells (24Hamawy M.M. Oliver C. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 615-621PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results, together with those reported in the literature, support the idea that the NH2-terminal region of FAK could play a role in the modulation of in vivo cell functions by means of two different mechanisms. First, this region might have a regulatory role in FAK activation, thereby regulating cell spreading, migration, or apoptosis. Although the FAT sequence is the critical determinant for FAK activation in fibroblasts (35Shen Y. Schaller M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2507-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the NH2-terminal region blocks the phosphorylation of the autophosphorylation site. After β integrin activation, a change in the conformation of the NH2-terminal region of FAK would render the autophosphorylation tyrosine accessible for phosphorylation, leading to FAK activation (for review see Ref. 9Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Second, independent of FAK activation, the NH2-terminal region could itself act as an adaptor or linker molecule that can regulate other cellular events such as the IgE receptor-induced mast cell degranulation.
