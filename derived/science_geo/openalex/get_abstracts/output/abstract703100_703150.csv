https://openalex.org/W4307295010,"G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) govern the physiological response to stimuli by modulating the activity of downstream effectors, including ion channels. TRPM3 is an ion channel inhibited by GPCRs through direct interaction with G protein (Gβγ) released upon their activation. This GPCR-TRPM3 signaling pathway contributes to the analgesic effect of morphine. Here, we characterized Gβγ inhibition of TRPM3 using electrophysiology and single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). From electrophysiology, we obtained a half inhibition constant (IC50) of ∼240 nM. Using cryo-EM, we determined structures of mouse TRPM3 expressed in human cells with and without Gβγ and with and without PIP2, a lipid required for TRPM3 activity, at resolutions of 2.7–4.7 Å. Gβγ-TRPM3 interfaces vary depending on PIP2 occupancy; however, in all cases, Gβγ appears loosely attached to TRPM3. The IC50 in electrophysiology experiments raises the possibility that additional unknown factors may stabilize the TRPM3-Gβγ complex."
https://openalex.org/W4307348203,"The rise in working-age mortality rates in the United States in recent decades largely reflects stalled declines in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality alongside rising mortality from alcohol-induced causes, suicide, and drug poisoning; and it has been especially severe in some U.S. states. Building on recent work, this study examined whether U.S. state policy contexts may be a central explanation. We modeled the associations between working-age mortality rates and state policies during 1999 to 2019. We used annual data from the 1999–2019 National Vital Statistics System to calculate state-level age-adjusted mortality rates for deaths from all causes and from CVD, alcohol-induced causes, suicide, and drug poisoning among adults ages 25–64 years. We merged that data with annual state-level data on eight policy domains, such as labor and taxes, where each domain was scored on a 0–1 conservative-to-liberal continuum. Results show that the policy domains were associated with working-age mortality. More conservative marijuana policies and more liberal policies on the environment, gun safety, labor, economic taxes, and tobacco taxes in a state were associated with lower mortality in that state. Especially strong associations were observed between certain domains and specific causes of death: between the gun safety domain and suicide mortality among men, between the labor domain and alcohol-induced mortality, and between both the economic tax and tobacco tax domains and CVD mortality. Simulations indicate that changing all policy domains in all states to a fully liberal orientation might have saved 171,030 lives in 2019, while changing them to a fully conservative orientation might have cost 217,635 lives."
https://openalex.org/W4307309194,"Legalization of recreational cannabis in Ontario included the legalization of flower and herbs (Phase 1, October 2018), and was followed by the deregulation of cannabis retailers and sales of edibles (Phase 2, February 2020). Research on the impact of cannabis legalization on acute care utilization is nascet; no research has investigated potential age, gender, and geographically vulnerable subgroup effects. Residents living in Northern Ontario not only have higher levels of substance use problems, but also have inadequate access to primary healthcare. Our study investigated the impact of Ontario's recreational cannabis policy (including Phase 1 and 2) on cannabis-attributable emergency department (ED) visits, and estimated the impact separately for different age and gender groups, with additional analyses focused on Northern Ontarians. We created a cohort of adults (18 and over) eligible for provincial universal health insurance with continuous coverage from 2015-2021 (n = 14,900,820). An interrupted time series was used to examine the immediate impact and month-to-month changes in cannabis-related ED visits associated with Phase 1 & 2 for each subgroup. While Northern Ontario has higher rates of cannabis-related ED visits, both Northern and Southern Ontario show similar patterns of changes. Phase 1 was associated with significant increases in adults 25-64, with the strongest increases seen in women 45-64. Month-to-month trends were flattened in most groups compared to pre-legalization. Phase 2 was associated with significant immediate increases for adults aged 18-44 in both genders, but the increases were larger in women than men. No significant month-to-month changes were detected in this period. While current preventive efforts are largely focused on reducing cannabis-related harms in youths and younger adults, our results show that adults 25-64, particularly women, have been significantly impacted by cannabis policies. Further research on gender-specific cannabis dosage and targeted interventions for adult women should be investigated. Legalization did not appear to have a differential impact on Northern versus Southern Ontario, but higher rates of ED visits in the North should be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W4307216068,"Low heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic imbalance, is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure (HF). However, its relationship with HF subtypes; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has not been studied prior.We conducted a longitudinal study in Women's Health Initiative study cohort to investigate the association of baseline quartiles of resting heart rate (rHR) and HRV measures; SDNN (SD of normal-to-normal RR interval) and RMSSD (root mean square of successive difference of RR interval) measured by twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) on enrollment, with the risk of hospitalized HF and its subtypes. Total of 28,603 post-menopausal women, predominantly non-Hispanic whites (69%), with a mean (SD) age of 62.6 (7.1) years, free of baseline CHD and HF were included. In a fully adjusted cox-proportional hazards regression model which adjusted for age, race, BMI, alcohol intake, education, physical activity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, use of beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker, hormone therapy, and time-varying incident CHD, the hazard ratios of lowest quartile of HRV (Q1) with HF risk were significant (Q1 SDNN compared to Q4 SDNN: 1.22, 95% CI 1.07, 1.39; Q1 RMSSD compared to Q4 RMSSD: 1.17, 95% CI 1.02, 1.33). On subgroup analysis of HF subtypes, low HRV was associated with elevated HFpEF risk (Q1 vs Q4 SDNN: 1.22, 95% CI 1.02, 1.47) but not with HFrEF (Q1 vs Q4 SDNN: 1.19, 95% CI 0.95, 1.50; Q1 RMSSD: 1.13, 95% CI 0.90, 1.43).Low HRV is associated with elevated overall hospitalized HF risk and HFpEF risk in post-menopausal women. Whether interventions to increase HRV through healthy lifestyle changes will decrease HF risk warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4307309177,"Background Biological and psychological mechanisms may be responsible for menstrual irregularities occurring among women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study design From January 2019 to September 2021, women (18- to 45-years-old and not using hormonal contraception) were recruited in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Cross-sectional, self-report surveys collected data on menstrual irregularities, COVID-19 vaccination, stress, depression, and loneliness. A EUA approved rapid test assay using whole blood measured SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests described menstrual irregularities among women recruited before versus after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and with detectable versus undetectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. A logistic regression examined the relationship between the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and menstrual irregularities controlling for age, stress, depression, and loneliness. Results Among 182 women enrolled, 73 were enrolled after pandemic onset, and 36 provided vaccination data. Having detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was associated with a higher percentage of menstrual irregularities among unvaccinated women (0% vs. 39%, p = .026) and among all women regardless of vaccination status (31% vs. 5%; p = .005). Adjusting for age and psychological variables, the odds of menstrual irregularities were 7.03 times (95% CI [1.39, 35.60]; p = .019) higher among women with detectable antibodies compared to women without detectable antibodies. Neither enrollment date, age, nor psychological factors were associated to menstrual irregularities. Conclusions Biological mechanisms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be responsible for irregular menstruation and should be further examined to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women’s health."
https://openalex.org/W4307216086,"This study investigated the psychological impact on, coping behaviors of, and traumatic stress experienced by healthcare workers during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and formulated effective support strategies that can be implemented by hospitals and government policymakers to help healthcare staff overcome the pandemic.This cross-sectional study recruited clinical healthcare workers at a regional hospital in Nantou County, Taiwan. The questionnaire collected personal characteristics, data on the impact and coping behaviors of the pandemic, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). A total of 354 valid questionnaires were collected. The statistical methods employed were univariate and multivariate stepwise regression, and logistic regression.Perceived impact and coping behaviors were found to be moderate in degree, and traumatic stress was lower than that in other countries. However, our data identified the following subgroups that require special attention: those with young age, those living with minor children, nurses, those with self-rated poor mental health, and those with insufficient COVID-19-related training.Managers should pay particular attention to helping healthcare workers in high-risk groups, strengthen COVID-19 training, provide adequate protective equipment and shelter, and offer psychological counseling."
https://openalex.org/W4307289530,"Adaptive sensory behavior is thought to depend on processing in recurrent cortical circuits, but how dynamics in these circuits shapes the integration and transmission of sensory information is not well understood. Here, we study neural coding in recurrently connected networks of neurons driven by sensory input. We show analytically how information available in the network output varies with the alignment between feedforward input and the integrating modes of the circuit dynamics. In light of this theory, we analyzed neural population activity in the visual cortex of mice that learned to discriminate visual features. We found that over learning, slow patterns of network dynamics realigned to better integrate input relevant to the discrimination task. This realignment of network dynamics could be explained by changes in excitatory-inhibitory connectivity among neurons tuned to relevant features. These results suggest that learning tunes the temporal dynamics of cortical circuits to optimally integrate relevant sensory input."
https://openalex.org/W4307309250,"Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne infectious disease in the United States. Post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD) is a condition affecting 10-20% of patients in which symptoms persist despite antibiotic treatment. Cognitive complaints are common among those with PTLD, suggesting that brain changes are associated with the course of the illness. However, there has been a paucity of evidence to explain the cognitive difficulties expressed by patients with PTLD. This study administered a working memory task to a carefully screened group of 12 patients with well-characterized PTLD and 18 healthy controls while undergoing functional MRI (fMRI). A subset of 12 controls and all 12 PTLD participants also received diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure white matter integrity. Clinical variables were also assessed and correlated with these multimodal MRI findings. On the working memory task, the patients with PTLD responded more slowly, but no less accurately, than did controls. FMRI activations were observed in expected regions by the controls, and to a lesser extent, by the PTLD participants. The PTLD group also hypoactivated several regions relevant to the task. Conversely, novel regions were activated by the PTLD group that were not observed in controls, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. Notably, three activations were located in white matter of the frontal lobe. DTI measures applied to these three regions of interest revealed that higher axial diffusivity correlated with fewer cognitive and neurological symptoms. Whole-brain DTI analyses revealed several frontal lobe regions in which higher axial diffusivity in the patients with PTLD correlated with longer duration of illness. Together, these results show that the brain is altered by PTLD, involving changes to white matter within the frontal lobe. Higher axial diffusivity may reflect white matter repair and healing over time, rather than pathology, and cognition appears to be dynamically affected throughout this repair process."
https://openalex.org/W4307313870,"The importance of involving men in reproductive, maternal and child health (RMCH) programs is increasingly recognized globally. In Nigeria, most MCH services do not actively engage fathers.To assess men's knowledge, involvement in MCH and the barriers in Southwest Nigeria. Predictors of good knowledge and involvement were also assessed.This was a community-based cross sectional study. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used in data collection which was done within a period of three months in 2018. Quantitative data were collected with interviewer administered questionnaires from 418 respondents who were selected by multistage sampling methodology. The topic was further explored using focus group discussion (FGD). Quantitative data were analysed using EPI-INFO version 7. Quantitative variables were summarized using means and standard deviations while multivariable analysis was carried out to determine predictors of good knowledge and involvement in MCH. A combination of deductive and inductive analysis was used for the qualitative data.Overall, 65% of men had good knowledge of MCH while 60.8% had good involvement. Predictors of good knowledge were being a Christian (AOR 1.674, 95% CI 1.045-2.679), being of Yoruba tribe (AOR 1.753, 95% CI 1.100-2.796), having post-secondary education (AOR 1.984, 95% CI 1.002-3.928), having more under-fives in the household (AOR 2.162 95% CI 1.365-3.425) and spouse having post-secondary education (AOR 2.755, 95% CI 1.189-6.382). Predictors of good involvement in MCH include higher educational level of spouse: secondary (AOR 2.852, 95% CI 1.214-6.699), post-secondary (AOR 2.270, 95% CI 1.000-5.161) and having good knowledge of MCH (AOR 2.518, 95% CI 1.587-3.994). From the FGD, other factors which influence involvement were related to traditional/cultural orientation, time constraint and finance among others.Men's knowledge and their involvement in maternal and child health were sub-optimal. For improvement, community-based intervention programmes should be designed for men and implemented, taking into consideration their traditional/cultural roles, religious orientation, busy schedules, and educational backgrounds. They should be re-oriented on their patriarchally informed belief about their perceived roles in RMCH."
https://openalex.org/W4307313917,"The Bronze Age village of Politiko- Troullia , located in the foothills of the copper-bearing Troodos mountains of central Cyprus, was occupied ~2050–1850 cal BCE. Excavated evidence shows that community activities included copper metallurgy (ore processing, smelting and casting), crop cultivation, and rearing of livestock. Faunal analysis reveals day-to-day subsistence practices that included consumption of sheep, goat, cattle, and pig, as well as community-scale ritual feasting focused on fallow deer, Dama dama mesopotamica . In this paper, we present bone collagen stable isotope data from these taxa to infer how these animals were managed. We incorporate stable isotope baselines calculated from modern cereal grains and compare these to archaeological seeds from Politiko- Troullia . Mean values of δ 13 C and δ 15 N cluster for livestock consistent with a diet of C3 plants, with a wider range in goats that suggests free-browsing herds. Higher δ 15 N values in cattle may reflect supplemental feeding or grazing in manured fields. Plant isotope values suggest livestock diets were predominantly composed of cultivated taxa. In contrast, deer and pig bones produce more negative mean δ 13 C and δ 15 N values suggesting that the villagers of Politiko- Troullia complemented their management of domesticated animals with hunting of wild deer and feral pigs in the woodlands surrounding their village."
https://openalex.org/W4307216124,"Multipurpose tree species are recognized as an important fodder source for livestock, but their potential remains untapped due to dearth of knowledge about their nutritive value. Therefore, 15 MPTs, i.e., Acacia catechu , Albizia chinensis , Bauhinia variegata , Celtis australis , Ficus roxburghii , Grewia optiva , Leucaena leucocephala , Melia composita , Morus serrata , Olea glandulifera , Ougienia oojeinensis , Pittosporum floribundum , Quercus glauca , Q . leucotrichophora and Salix tetrasperma were evaluated for nutritional characteristics, relative nutritive value index (RNVI), palatability index and farmers’ preference on a seasonal basis in north-western Himalayas mid-hills. Most of the nutritive and mineral content decreased as leaves matured with the exception of ether extract, calcium, copper, organic matter and carbohydrate content, while cell-wall constituents and anti-nutritional contents increased. Overall, M . serrata had the highest RNVI in spring and summer, while G . optiva during autumn and winter. Similarly, L . leucocephala had the highest palatability (97.86%), while M . composita (38.47%) had the lowest one. Additionally, G . optiva was the most favored MPT for livestock among farmers, while M . composita was the least ones. The outcome of the study will help policy makers, planners and farm managers in establishing large scale plantations of highly nutritious and palatable species, like G . optiva , L . leucocephala , B . variegata , and M . serrata for year-round supply of green leaves and as a supplement to low-quality feed."
https://openalex.org/W4307216190,"An outbreak of citrus greening or Huanglongbing disease bacteria occurs in many areas. We sampled and identified an ongoing ~year 2020 orange tree endemic in northern Thailand as Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. We thereby developed a plant greening disease ( C . Liberibacter asiaticus) detection assay using simple alkaline heat DNA lysis and loop-mediated isothermal amplification coupled hydroxynaphthol blue (AL-LAMP-HNB), and evaluated the developed assay for its feasibility as point-of-care detection on 65 plant leaf samples with 100–1×10 4 copies of C . Liberibacter asiaticus or mocked injection compared with commercial DNA lysis kit and PCR-GE. Our assay is sensitive to 5–8.9 copies of omp (equaling 0.0056–0.01 fg) compatible with PCR-GE limit of detection. This ultra sensitive limit of detection could allow the disease detection before clinical apparent state of disease when C . Liberibacter asiaticus infection number is few, i.e. fewer than 100 copies of C . Liberibacter asiaticus. The assay is also specific with 6 degenerate primers targeting every strain of C . Liberibacter asiaticus omp from GenBank database, rapid (40 min total assay time), inexpensive (~2–3 USD/reaction), does not require sophisticated instrumentation, and has comparable assay accuracy (93.85–100% accuracy, 100% specificity, and 89.74–100% sensitivity) to bacterial DNA extraction by a commercial kit followed by PCR and gel electrophoresis (92.31% accuracy, 100% specificity, and 87.18% sensitivity) based on the real sample tests. Hence, the technique could be used in local or laboratory resource-restricted settings. The test result could be read by naked eyes through the color change from violet (negative) to sky blue (positive) for a C . Liberibacter asiaticus-infected specimen. Furthermore, this assay uses safe chemical reagents and, thus, is safe for the users."
https://openalex.org/W4307309196,"Lifestyle factors contribute to childhood obesity risk, however it is unclear which lifestyle factors are most strongly associated with childhood obesity. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to simultaneously investigate the associations among dietary patterns, activity behaviors, and physical fitness with adiposity (body fat %, fat mass, body mass index [BMI], and waist to hip ratio) in preadolescent children. Preadolescent children (N = 392, 50% female, age: 9.5 ± 1.1year, BMI: 17.9 ± 3.3 kg/m 2 ) were recruited. Body fat (%) and fat mass (kg) were measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis. Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO 2 max), muscular strength (hand-grip strength), activity, sleep, and dietary pattern was assessed. Multivariable analysis revealed that cardiorespiratory fitness associated most strongly with all four indicators of adiposity (body fat (%) (β = -0.2; p &lt; .001), fat mass (β = -0.2; p &lt; .001), BMI (β = -0.1; p &lt; .001) and waist to hip ratio (β = -0.2; p &lt; .001). Additionally, fruit and vegetable consumption patterns were associated with body fat percentage, but the association was negligible (β = 0.1; p = 0.015). Therefore, future interventions should aim to promote the use of cardiorespiratory fitness as a means of reducing the obesity epidemic in children."
https://openalex.org/W4307309237,"The present study aimed to compare men and women with gambling disorder (GD) regarding presence of psychiatric comorbidity and socio-economic vulnerability, and to examine whether these factors appear before or after the gambling disorder. This is a retrospective case-control study, based on registers from The National Board of Health and Welfare and Statistics Sweden. A total of 3592 adults with GD were matched with two controls based on age and gender, including a total of 10776 individuals in the study. The study included psychiatric comorbidity through the presence of relevant diagnostic codes or pharmacological codes, and socio-economic vulnerability data through the presence of unemployment, social welfare payments and sickness/activity/rehabilitation compensation. Time between GD and psychiatric comorbidity/socio-economic vulnerability was calculated by subtracting dates between diagnoses/first incidence of socio-economic vulnerability factor and GD diagnosis. Women with GD were more likely to have a psychiatric comorbidity, compared to men. Overall, women were also more likely to receive their psychiatric diagnosis prior to GD diagnosis, while men were more likely to receive the diagnoses concurrently. Social welfare payments, and sickness support were more common among women, while there was no difference in unemployment between genders. Women were also more likely to receive sickness/activity/rehabilitation compensation prior to GD, than men who were more likely to receive these types of support after GD diagnosis. In conclusion, women appear to be at higher risk of psychiatric comorbidity and socio-economic vulnerability alongside GD. They are in general also more likely to receive have their psychiatric and psycho-social problems identified prior to GD, than men who are more likely to receive diagnoses concurrently."
https://openalex.org/W4307309249,"It has been suggested that the human microbiome might be vertically transmitted from mother to offspring and that early colonizers may play a critical role in development of the immune system. Studies have shown limited support for the vertical transmission of the intestinal microbiota but the derivation of the vaginal microbiota remains largely unknown. Although the vaginal microbiota of children and reproductive age women differ in composition, the vaginal microbiota could be vertically transmitted. To determine whether there was any support for this hypothesis, we examined the vaginal microbiota of daughter-mother pairs from the Baltimore metropolitan area (ages 14–27, 32–51; n = 39). We assessed whether the daughter’s microbiota was similar in composition to their mother’s using metataxonomics. Permutation tests revealed that while some pairs did have similar vaginal microbiota, the degree of similarity did not exceed that expected by chance. Genome-resolved metagenomics was used to identify shared bacterial strains in a subset of the families (n = 22). We found a small number of bacterial strains that were shared between mother-daughter pairs but identified more shared strains between individuals from different families, indicating that vaginal bacteria may display biogeographic patterns. Earlier-in-life studies are needed to demonstrate vertical transmission of the vaginal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W4307309260,"Using a unique survey of more than 7,000 respondents conducted immediately after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, we investigate potential drivers of the job satisfaction of healthcare workers. Relying on a representative sample of Italian physicians and nurses, we show that, in addition to personal characteristics (e.g., age, gender, health status), contextual factors (i.e., working conditions) play the leading role in explaining variation in the level of satisfaction (58%). In particular, working in a high-quality facility increases worker satisfaction and willingness to remain in the profession, and in the current medical specialization, while working in a province with a perceived shortage of medical personnel yields the opposite result. Direct experience with COVID-19 (e.g., having tested positive) is not significantly correlated with the level of job satisfaction, which is instead significantly reduced by changes in the working conditions caused by the health emergency."

We then modeled the associated medical and nonmedical costs of each outcome incurred by birthing people and their children in 2019, projected through five years postpartum.We estimated that the total cost of nine maternal morbidity conditions for all pregnancies and births in 2019 was $32.3 billion from conception to five years postpartum, amounting to $8,624 in societal costs per birthing person.We found only nine maternal morbidity conditions with sufficient supporting evidence of linkages to outcomes and costs. The lack of comprehensive data for other conditions suggests that maternal morbidity exacts a higher toll on society than we found.Although this study likely provides lower bound cost estimates, it establishes the substantial adverse societal impact of maternal morbidity and suggests further opportunities to invest in maternal health."
https://openalex.org/W4307313765,"Remdesivir is a leading therapy in patients with moderate to severe coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection; the majority of whom are older individuals. Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog that incorporates into nascent viral RNA, inhibiting RNA-directed RNA polymerases, including that of SARS-CoV-2. Less is known about remdesivir's effects on mitochondria, particularly in older adults where mitochondria are known to be dysfunctional. Furthermore, its effect on age-induced mitochondrial mutations and copy number has not been previously studied. We hypothesized that remdesivir adversely affects mtDNA copy number and deletion mutation frequency in aged rodents. To test this hypothesis, 30-month-old male F333BNF1 rats were treated with remdesivir for three months. To determine if remdesivir adversely affects mtDNA, we measured copy number and mtDNA deletion frequency in rat hearts, kidneys, and skeletal muscles using digital PCR. We found no effects from three months of remdesivir treatment on mtDNA copy number or deletion mutation frequency in 33-month-old rats. These data support the notion that remdesivir does not compromise mtDNA quality or quantity at old age in mammals. Future work should focus on examining additional tissues such as brain and liver, and extend testing to human clinical samples."
https://openalex.org/W4307321153,"The present contribution focuses on investigating the interaction of people and environment in small-scale farming societies. Our study is centred on the particular way settlement location constraints economic strategy when technology is limited, and social division of work is not fully developed. Our intention is to investigate prehistoric socioeconomic organisation when farming began in the Old World along the Levant shores of Iberian Peninsula, the Neolithic phenomenon. We approach this subject extracting relevant information from a big set of ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological cases using Machine Learning methods. This paper explores the use of Bayesian networks as explanatory models of the independent variables-the environment- and dependent variables-social decisions-, and also as predictive models. The study highlights how subsistence strategies are modified by ecological and topographical variables of the settlement location and their relationship with social organisation. It also establishes the role of Bayesian networks as a suitable supervised Machine Learning methodology for investigating socio-ecological systems, introducing their use to build useful data-driven models to address relevant archaeological and anthropological questions."
https://openalex.org/W4307321159,"This study was designed to evaluate the spatial distribution characteristics of 1432 beautiful leisure villages in China using econometric geography and spatial geographic information system analysis methods, such as nearest distance index, K index, and nuclear density. We also used the grid cost weighted distance algorithm to determine the spatial accessibility of beautiful leisure villages and the overall accessibility of county units. In addition, our evaluations determined the spatial differences in county accessibility using exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). Our results showed that the spatial distribution of the beautiful leisure villages in China could be best described using the cohesion type classification and that there were large differences in their distribution between provinces and economic regions. The average accessibility time of beautiful leisure villages was 197.24 min with only 57.19% of these commutes being less than 2 h, and only 17.88% being less than 30 min. The area with the longest accessibility time was located on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, at up to 1510.03 min. The spatial distribution of accessibility showed obvious traffic directivity producing a positive Moran I value for most counties. There was also a significant positive correlation between the accessibility of beautiful leisure villages and their adjacent areas, and clear patterns of hot spots-sub-hot spots-sub-cold spots-cold spots from east to west. The overall service scope of beautiful leisure villages was characterized by west > east > middle, with topography, population, economy, and location acting as the major factors in the spatial distribution of these beautiful leisure villages in China."

However, most studies have been conducted in Western countries and have excluded patients with pre-existing heart disease. We investigated the association between coronary artery calcium (CAC) and all-cause mortality in an Asian cohort and in subgroups stratified by age, sex, smoking, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, blood pressure, and biochemical parameters.We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 4529 health examinees who underwent multidetector computed tomography in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan between 2011 and 2016. The mean follow-up was 3.5 years. Cox regression was used to estimate the relative hazards of death. Stratified analyses were performed.The all-cause mortality rates were 2.94, 4.88, 17.6, and 33.1 per 1000 person-years for CAC scores of 0, 1-100, 101-400, and >400, respectively. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for all-cause mortality were 0.95 (0.53, 1.72), 1.87 (0.89, 3.90), and 3.05 (1.46, 6.39) for CAC scores of 1-100, 101-400, and >400, respectively, relative to a CAC score of 0. Compared with CAC ≤ 400, the HRs (95% CIs) for CAC > 400 were 6.46 (2.44, 17.15) and 1.94 (1.00, 3.76) in younger and older adults, respectively, indicating that age was a moderating variable (p = 0.02).High CAC scores were associated with increased all-cause mortality. Although older adult patients had higher risks of death, the relative risk of death for patients with CAC > 400 was more prominent in people younger than 65 years."
https://openalex.org/W4307216075,"Mitochondrial activity in cancer cells has been central to cancer research since Otto Warburg first published his thesis on the topic in 1956. Although Warburg proposed that oxidative phosphorylation in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was perturbed in cancer, later research has shown that oxidative phosphorylation is activated in most cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). However, more detailed knowledge on mitochondrial metabolism and metabolic pathways in cancers is still lacking. In this study we expand our previously developed method for analyzing functional homologous proteins (FunHoP), which can provide a more detailed view of metabolic pathways. FunHoP uses results from differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq data to improve pathway analysis. By adding information on subcellular localization based on experimental data and computational predictions we can use FunHoP to differentiate between mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial processes in cancerous and normal prostate cell lines. Our results show that mitochondrial pathways are upregulated in PCa and that splitting metabolic pathways into mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial counterparts using FunHoP adds to the interpretation of the metabolic properties of PCa cells."

https://openalex.org/W4307239423,"The complex effects of alcohol consumption on the cardiovascular system vary with mean daily consumption and duration of intake. This population-based retrospective cohort study aimed to explore the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Data was collected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2000 to 2013. A total of 7,420 patients with AUD were included in our study group, and 29,680 age- and sex-matched controls without AUD in the control group. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to investigate the effects of AUD on the risk of CVD. Most patients were men aged 25-44 years. At the end of the follow-up period, the AUD group had a significantly higher incidence of CVD (27.39% vs. 19.97%, P<0.001) and more comorbidities than the control group. The AUD group also exhibited a significantly higher incidence of CVD than the control group based on the Cox regression analysis and Fine and Gray's competing risk model (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.447, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.372-1.52 5, P<0.001). Furthermore, male sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety, depression, and a high Charlson Comorbidity Index were also associated with an increased risk of CVD. Patients with AUD in different CVD subgroups, such as those with CVD, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and stroke, were at a significantly higher risk of disease than those without AUD; CVD (AHR = 1.447, 95% CI = 1.372-1.525, P<0.001), IHD (AHR = 1.304, 95% CI = 1.214-1.401, P<0.001), and stroke (AHR = 1.640, 95% CI = 1.519-1.770, P<0.001). The risk also significantly differed among patients in the different CVD subgroups. We observed an association between AUD and development of CVD even after adjusting for several comorbidities and medications in our nationwide population cohort."
https://openalex.org/W4307240057,"This study was aimed at identifying the B cell responses which could distinguish between 'latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)' and active TB disease. Study subjects were smear-positive TB patients (n = 54) and their disease-free household contacts (HHCs, n = 120). The sera were used for determination of antibody levels (ΔOD values) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis membrane (MtM) antigens by ELISA and for visualisation of seroreactive MtM antigens by immunoblotting. B cell subsets in whole blood samples were determined by flow cytometry. In TB sera, levels of IgG antibodies were significantly higher than IgM and IgA whereas IgM and IgA antibody levels were comparable. Conversely, HHC sera had significantly higher IgM antibody levels than IgG and IgA. The ratio of IgM to IgG antibodies in HHCs were also significantly higher than in patients. Immunoblotting revealed that some of the MtM antigens (<10, ~12 and ~25 kDa) reacted with TB as well as HHC sera whereas some other antigens (~16, ~36, ~45 and ~60 kDa) reacted with most of TB and a subset of HHC sera. Frequencies of classical memory B cells (cMBCs, CD19+CD27+) were significantly higher, and of IgG+ cMBCs were significantly lower in HHCs than in patients. Frequencies of IgA+ cMBCs in HHCs and patients were comparable but both were significantly higher than the corresponding frequencies of IgG+ cMBCs. Frequencies of IgA+ atypical MBCs (aMBCs, CD19+CD27-) in HHCs and patients were also comparable and significantly higher than the IgG+ aMBCs. The plasmablast (CD19+CD27++CD38++) frequencies in HHCs and patients were comparable. These results suggest that the IgM/IgG antibody ratio, antibody binding to selected MtM antigens and relative frequencies of MBC subsets could indicate protective or pathogenic immune responses following the primary infection with Mtb. Responses that orchestrate protection leading to a 'quiescent' LTBI may provide clues to an effective vaccination strategy against TB."
https://openalex.org/W4307240463,"Peptide Lv is a small endogenous secretory peptide that is expressed in various tissues and conserved across different species. Patients with diabetic retinopathy, an ocular disease with pathological angiogenesis, have upregulated peptide Lv in their retinas. The pro-angiogenic activity of peptide Lv is in part through promoting vascular endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration, and sprouting, but its molecular mechanism is not completely understood. This study aimed to decipher how peptide Lv promotes EC-dependent angiogenesis by using patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings, Western immunoblotting, quantitative PCR, and cell proliferation assays in cultured ECs. Endothelial cells treated with peptide Lv became significantly hyperpolarized, an essential step for EC activation. Treatment with peptide Lv augmented the expression and current densities of the intermediate-conductance calcium-dependent potassium (K Ca 3.1) channels that contribute to EC hyperpolarization but did not augment other potassium channels. Blocking K Ca 3.1 attenuated peptide Lv-elicited EC proliferation. These results indicate that peptide Lv-stimulated increases of functional K Ca 3.1 in ECs contributes to EC activation and EC-dependent angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4307309191,"Biophysical models of large-scale brain activity are a fundamental tool for understanding the mechanisms underlying the patterns observed with neuroimaging. These models combine a macroscopic description of the within- and between-ensemble dynamics of neurons within a single architecture. A challenge for these models is accounting for modulations of within-ensemble synchrony over time. Such modulations in local synchrony are fundamental for modeling behavioral tasks and resting-state activity. Another challenge comes from the difficulty in parametrizing large scale brain models which hinders researching principles related with between-ensembles differences. Here we derive a parsimonious large scale brain model that can describe fluctuations of local synchrony. Crucially, we do not reduce within-ensemble dynamics to macroscopic variables first, instead we consider within and between-ensemble interactions similarly while preserving their physiological differences. The dynamics of within-ensemble synchrony can be tuned with a parameter which manipulates local connectivity strength. We simulated resting-state static and time-resolved functional connectivity of alpha band envelopes in models with identical and dissimilar local connectivities. We show that functional connectivity emerges when there are high fluctuations of local and global synchrony simultaneously (i.e. metastable dynamics). We also show that for most ensembles, leaning towards local asynchrony or synchrony correlates with the functional connectivity with other ensembles, with the exception of some regions belonging to the default-mode network."
https://openalex.org/W4307309243,"Unidentified human remains have historically been investigated nationally by law enforcement authorities. However, this approach is outdated in a globalized world with rapid transportation means, where humans easily move long distances across borders. Cross-border cooperation in solving cold-cases is rare due to political, administrative or technical challenges. It is fundamental to develop new tools to provide rapid and cost-effective leads for international cooperation. In this work, we demonstrate that isotopic measurements are effective screening tools to help identify cold-cases with potential international ramifications. We first complete existing databases of hydrogen and sulfur isotopes in human hair from residents across North America by compiling or analyzing hair from Canada, the United States (US) and Mexico. Using these databases, we develop maps predicting isotope variations in human hair across North America. We demonstrate that both δ 2 H and δ 34 S values of human hair are highly predictable and display strong spatial patterns. Multi-isotope analysis combined with dual δ 2 H and δ 34 S geographic probability maps provide evidence for international travel in two case studies. In the first, we demonstrate that multi-isotope analysis in bulk hair of deceased border crossers found in the US, close to the Mexico-US border, help trace their last place of residence or travel back to specific regions of Mexico. These findings were validated by the subsequent identification of these individuals through the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner in Tucson, Arizona. In the second case study, we demonstrate that sequential multi-isotope analysis along the hair strands of an unidentified individual found in Canada provides detailed insights into the international mobility of this individual during the last year of life. In both cases, isotope data provide strong leads towards international travel."
https://openalex.org/W4307309245,"This study explored how the Big Five personality traits, as well as measures of personality disorders, are related to two different measures of conspiracy theories (CTs)The two measures correlated r = .58 and were applied to examine generalisability of findings. We also measured participants (N = 397) general knowledge levels and ideology in the form of religious and political beliefs. Results show that the Big Five and ideology are related to CTs but these relationships are generally wiped out by the stronger effects of the personality disorder scales. Two personality disorder clusters (A and B) were significant correlates of both CT measures, in both cases accounting for similar amounts of variance (20%). The personality disorders most predictive of conspiracy theories were related to the A cluster, characterized by schizotypal symptoms such as oddities of thinking and loose associations. These findings were corroborated by an additional analysis using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). LSA demonstrated that the items measuring schizotypal and related symptoms are cognitively related to both our measures of CTs. The implications for the studying of CTs is discussed, and limitations are acknowledged."
https://openalex.org/W4307309246,"Compared to the numerous reports on mental health outcomes of workplace bullying victims, research on organizational outcomes of witnesses and physical health outcomes of victims and witnesses is scarce. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between bullying victimization and witnessing and various physical and mental health outcomes and organizational outcomes such as sickness absence, work performance, and job satisfaction.This study used cross-sectional data from a nationally representative, community-based sample of 5,000 Japanese residents aged 20-60. We analyzed data from 1,496 respondents after excluding those not working at the time of the survey and those with missing values. Workplace bullying, psychological distress, physical complaints, and job satisfaction were assessed with the New Brief Job Stress Questionnaire and work performance with the World Health Organization's Health and Work Performance Questionnaire. In addition, subjective health status, physician-diagnosed mental or physical illness, and sickness absence were asked as one item. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis or Poisson regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between victimization/witnessing workplace bullying and health and organizational outcomes.Both victimization and witnessing workplace bullying were significantly associated with psychological distress, physical complaints, subjective poor health, physician-diagnosed mental disorders, and job dissatisfaction. Victimization of workplace bullying was further associated with physician-diagnosed respiratory diseases, sickness absence (≥7 days), and poor work performance. Victims were absent from work for 4.5 more sick days and had 11.2% lower work performance than non-victims.The results showed that both victimization and witnessing workplace bullying were significantly associated with physical and mental outcomes and various organizational outcomes. Organizations should implement further measures to prevent personal and organizational losses due to workplace bullying."
https://openalex.org/W4307309248,"A primary focus of research on conspiracy theories has been understanding the psychological characteristics that predict people’s level of conspiracist ideation. However, the dynamics of conspiracist ideation—i.e., how such tendencies change over time—are not well understood. To help fill this gap in the literature, we used data from two longitudinal studies (Study 1 N = 107; Study 2 N = 1,037) conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that greater belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories at baseline predicts both greater endorsement of a novel real-world conspiracy theory involving voter fraud in the 2020 American Presidential election (Study 1) and increases in generic conspiracist ideation over a period of several months (Studies 1 and 2). Thus, engaging with real-world conspiracy theories appears to act as a gateway, leading to more general increases in conspiracist ideation. Beyond enhancing our knowledge of conspiracist ideation, this work highlights the importance of fighting the spread of conspiracy theories."
https://openalex.org/W4307309257,"Despite attempts to increase gender parity in politics, global efforts have struggled to ensure equal female representation. This is likely tied to implicit gender biases against women in authority. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of gender biases that appear in online political discussion. To this end, we collect 10 million comments on Reddit in conversations about male and female politicians, which enables an exhaustive study of automatic gender bias detection. We address not only misogynistic language, but also other manifestations of bias, like benevolent sexism in the form of seemingly positive sentiment and dominance attributed to female politicians, or differences in descriptor attribution. Finally, we conduct a multi-faceted study of gender bias towards politicians investigating both linguistic and extra-linguistic cues. We assess 5 different types of gender bias, evaluating coverage, combinatorial, nominal, sentimental and lexical biases extant in social media language and discourse. Overall, we find that, contrary to previous research, coverage and sentiment biases suggest equal public interest in female politicians. Rather than overt hostile or benevolent sexism, the results of the nominal and lexical analyses suggest this interest is not as professional or respectful as that expressed about male politicians. Female politicians are often named by their first names and are described in relation to their body, clothing, or family; this is a treatment that is not similarly extended to men. On the now banned far-right subreddits, this disparity is greatest, though differences in gender biases still appear in the right and left-leaning subreddits. We release the curated dataset to the public for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W4307313794,"Infectious disease outbreaks are a primary contributor to coral reef decline worldwide. A particularly lethal disease, black band disease (BBD), was one of the first coral diseases reported and has since been documented on reefs worldwide. BBD is described as a microbial consortium of photosynthetic cyanobacteria, sulfate-reducing and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria, and heterotrophic bacteria and archaea. The disease is visually identified by a characteristic dark band that moves across apparently healthy coral tissue leaving behind bare skeleton. Despite its virulence, attempts to effectively treat corals with BBD in the field have been limited. Here, we developed and tested several different therapeutic agents on Pseudodiploria spp. corals with signs of active BBD at Buck Island Reef National Monument in St. Croix, USVI. A variety of therapies were tested, including hydrogen peroxide-based treatments, ointment containing antibiotics, and antiviral/antimicrobial-based ointments (referred to as CoralCure). The CoralCure ointments, created by Ocean Alchemists LLC, focused on the dosing regimen and delivery mechanisms of the different active ingredients. Active ingredients included carbamide peroxide, Lugol's iodine solution, along with several proprietary essential oil and natural product blends. Additionally, the active ingredients had different release times based on treatment: CoralCure A-C had a release time of 24 hours, CoralCure D-F had a release time of 72 hours. The ointments were applied directly to the BBD lesion. Also, jute rope was saturated with a subset of these CoralCure ointment formulations to assist with adhesion. These ropes were then applied to the leading edge of the BBD lesion for one week to ensure sufficient exposure. Corals were revisited approximately three to five months after treatment application to assess disease progression rates and the presence/absence of lesions-the metrics used to quantify the efficacy of each treatment. Although most of the treatments were unsuccessful, two CoralCure rope formulations-CoralCure D rope and CoralCure E rope, eliminated the appearance of BBD in 100% of the corals treated. As such, these treatments significantly reduced the likelihood of BBD occurrence compared to the untreated controls. Additionally, lesions treated with these formulations lost significantly less tissue compared with controls. These results provide the mechanisms for an easily employable method to effectively treat a worldwide coral disease."
https://openalex.org/W4307313923,"The present processes of research assessment, i.e. focusing on one or a few, related, scientometrics, foster questionable authorship practices, like gifting authorship to non-contributing people. An especially harmful one of these unethical practices is the formation of publication cartels, where authors offer gift authorship to each other reciprocally. Here, by developing a simple model and a simulation of the publication process I investigate how beneficial cartels can be and what measure can be used to restrict them. My results indicate that publication cartels can significantly boost members' productivity even if paper counts are weighted by the inverse of author number (the 1/n rule). Nevertheless, applying the 1/n rule generates conflicts of interest both among cartel members themselves and between cartel members and non-members which might lead to the self-purification of the academic publishing industry."
https://openalex.org/W4307313932,"Introduction Falls are common in Parkinson’s disease, and a recognised research priority. Falls lead to physical and psychological morbidity in people with Parkinson’s disease and their caregivers, however, those with cognitive impairment/ dementia and caregivers have often been excluded from previous studies. This qualitative study explored how people with Parkinson’s disease and their family caregivers understood and experienced falling and healthcare services relating to falls prevention and management. Methods A varied and purposive sample of 20 people with Parkinson’s disease (40% confirmed or suspected cognitive impairment/ dementia) and 18 caregivers took part in semi-structured interviews. Eight people with Parkinson’s disease and their caregivers were interviewed as a dyad, 22 participants were interviewed alone. Interviews were analysed through inductive thematic analysis. Results Four themes were developed: (i) struggling with thoughts and feelings about falling, (ii) recognising and managing risks surrounding falling, (iii) navigating health and care provision for falling, and (iv) changing as a couple due to falling. Different aspects of falls provoked a range of negative emotions and a variety of coping strategies were adopted. Falls and trying to avoid falls burdened a couple in a number of ways; beyond physical health they also affected functioning, physiological wellbeing, and relationships. Dyads analysed falls to understand their aetiology and described working together to manage them. This often happened in the absence of adequate support and advice with little involvement of healthcare professionals. When cognitive impairment/ dementia was present this brought additional challenges to falls management, with caregivers taking on a greater and more frustrating role. Conclusion Dyads required relevant falls-related information and the difficulties associated with cognitive decline should be recognised by researchers and healthcare professionals. Dyads required support in attributing reasons for falls, and increased awareness of healthcare professionals’ different roles to improve patient- professional communication and facilitate patient-centred care."
https://openalex.org/W4307348152,"This study examines urban innovation activities from the perspective of improving the efficiency of innovation chains and explored their operational patterns. The connotation of the urban innovation chain was analyzed following the process of the innovation chain and the characteristics of urban innovation activities. The urban innovation chain can be divided into the following three stages: original, technological, and innovation transformation. An indicator system for evaluating the three capacities of the urban innovation chain was established. Furthermore, the development level of strategic emerging industries was used as an indicator to measure the chain’s efficiency and analyze the relationship between these three constructed capacities in Chinese national innovative cities. Data published on the national innovative cities were used to measure the capacity of the urban innovation chain. The development of Strategic emerging industries indicates cities’ innovation performance, and an inductive approach was applied to analyze the relationship between the capacity construction of the urban innovation chain and innovation performance in innovative cities. This study found that the capacity of the urban innovation chain positively affected urban innovation performance and that the balanced development of the three capacities positively affected urban innovation performance. When urban innovation performance was at its highest, the contribution of original innovation capacity to innovation performance was significantly greater than that of the other two capacities; thus, an inverted U-curve illustrates the relationship between the improvement of urban innovation performance and the balance of the three capacities of the urban innovation chain. This study’s conclusions enrich the relevant theories of the innovation chain, provide a reference for the construction of the urban innovation chain, and promote the development of Strategic emerging industries."
https://openalex.org/W4307216052,"Background We compared low-salt preference between patients with major chronic diseases, also known as non-communicable diseases (hereinafter referred to as ‘“major NCD patients’”), and the general population. Methods We used data extracted from the Korea Community Health Survey Community during the period of 2008–2019. We evaluated the low-salt preference of 13 major NCD patients by year and region to analyse recent changes in low-salt preference trends, using joinpoint regression. Results A greater majority of major NCD patients had a higher low-salt preference than general population; however, the overall trend was not significantly significant. The low-salt preference rate (Type III) was highest among patients with diabetes (15.6%), followed by hypertension (14.1%) and dyslipidaemia (13.4%), with the general population displaying the lowest rate (11.3%). The rates of adherence to a low-salt diet and fried food without soy sauce gradually increased until 2013 and then declined. The rate of adherence to not adding salt and soy sauce at the table gradually increased and maintained a high rate of adherence until 2019, except for patients with some diseases. Regional variations in low-salt preference tended to be greater in patients with major NCDs than general population. Conclusion There is a need to improve the low-salt diet behaviour of not only major NCD patients, but also the general population. Various low-salt diet programs need to be promoted, such as education on a low-salt diet, certification for low-salt restaurants, and sodium tax. Moreover, it is necessary to continuously monitor the low-salt preferences of major NCD patients."
https://openalex.org/W4307216087,"Since human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection may be underestimated and HHV-8 subtype circulation in Spain remains unknown, a molecular epidemiologic study is highly desirable.This study aimed to analyse HHV-8 subtype diversity and their distribution in Spain.The study included 142 HHV-8 infected patients. A nested PCR was developed in order to permit Sanger sequencing of HHV-8 K1 ORF directly from clinical samples received at the CNM from 2013 to 2021. Phylogenetic characterization was performed.Genotypes A and C comprised 55.6% and 42.3% of strains. Regarding subtypes, 25.4% of strains were C3, 19.7% were A3, 14.1% were A5, and C2, A1, A4, C1, A2, C7 were 11.3%, 11.3%, 8.5%, 4.2%, 2.1% and 1.4%, respectively. Subtype E1, E2 and B1 were found in only one patient each (0.7%). The Madrid region accounted for 52.1% of patients and showed a significantly different subtype distribution compared to the others (P = 0.018). Subtypes B1, E1, and E2 were observed to appear sporadically, although overall genotypes A and subtype C3 remained the most frequent and unwavering. Subtype A3 presented the highest diversity as displayed by the highest number of clusters in phylogenetic analysis. Non-significant differences in viral loads between genotypes were found, but significantly higher viral loads in subtype C2 compared to subtype C3 was found, while no significant subtype differences were observed between subtypes within genotype A. Infections with HHV-8 were detected in 94 (66.2%) patients without KS and compared to patients with KS non-significant differences in subtype distribution were found.Subtype prevalence and regional distribution followed a similar pattern compared to other western European countries. Our study is the first to report HHV-8 subtypes E1 and E2 circulating in Europe that might be reflective of migration of population from Caribbean countries. Our study suggests that infection by HHV-8 is underestimated, and wider screening should be recommended for risk groups."

https://openalex.org/W4307216187,"In Chinese languages, tones are used to express the lexical meaning of words. It is therefore important to analyze the role of lexical tone in Chinese sentence recognition accuracy. There is a lack of research on the role of Cantonese lexical tones in sentence recognition accuracy. Therefore, this study examined the contribution of lexical tone information to Cantonese sentence recognition accuracy and its cognitive correlates in adults with normal hearing (NH). A text-to-speech synthesis engine was used to synthesize Cantonese daily-use sentences with each word carrying an original or a flat lexical tone, which were then presented to 97 participants in quiet, in speech-shaped noise (SSN), and in two-talker babble (TTB) noise conditions. Both target sentences and noises were presented at 65 dB binaurally via insert headphones. It was found that listeners with NH can almost perfectly recognize a daily-use Cantonese sentence with mismatched lexical tone information in quiet, while their sentence recognition decreases substantially in noise. The same finding was reported for Mandarin, which has a relatively simple tonal system, suggesting that the current results may be applicable to other tonal languages. In addition, working memory (WM) was significantly related to decline in sentence recognition score in the TTB but not in the SSN, when the lexical tones were mismatched. This finding can be explained using the Ease of Language Understanding model and suggests that those with higher WM are less likely to be affected by the degraded lexical information for perceiving daily-use sentences in the TTB."
https://openalex.org/W4307216418,"For information interventions to be effective, recipients must first engage with them. We show that engagement with repeated digital information interventions is shaped by subtle and strategically controllable signals of the information’s value. In particular, recipients’ expectations are shaped by signals from the “envelope” that surrounds a message in an information intervention. The envelope conveys clues about the message but does not reveal the message itself. When people expect the message to be valuable, delivering it in a consistent and recognizable envelope over time increases engagement relative to varying the envelope. Conversely, when people expect the message to be of little value, delivering it in a consistent and recognizable envelope decreases engagement relative to varying the envelope. We show this with two field experiments involving massive open online courses and one online survey experiment (all pre-registered, N = 439,150)."
https://openalex.org/W4307216464,"Objectives Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a lymphoproliferative disease with heterogeneous clinical course. Recent studies revealed a link between NOTCH1 mutation and the overexpression of MYC and MYC -related genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and protein biosynthesis, such as nucleophosmin-1 ( NPM1) , in CLL cells. In the present study, we aim to evaluate the impact of the NOTCH1 mutation on the MYC and MYC induced NPM1 expression in CLL cells via quantification of their transcripts. Methods Using qRT-PCR, we analyzed the levels of MYC and three main NPM1 splice variants in 214 samples collected from CLL patients. We assessed the impact of each splice variant on CLL prognostic markers, including the IGHV , TP53 , NOTCH1 , SF3B1 , and MYD88 mutational status, cytogenetic aberrations, and laboratory features. Results Significantly higher levels of NPM1 . R1 transcripts in patients with unmutated compared to mutated IGHV status were found. The median time to first treatment (TTFT) in patients with a high level of NPM1 . R1 was significantly shorter compared to the group with low NPM1 . R1 levels (1.5 vs 33 months, p = 0.0002). Moreover, in Multivariate Cox Proportional Hazard Regression Model NPM1 . R1 splice variant provided an independent prognostic value for TTFT. Conclusion In conclusion, our study indicates the prognostic significance of the level of NPM1 . R1 expression and suggests the importance of splicing alterations in the pathogenesis of CLL."
https://openalex.org/W4307239412,"Public health measures (PHMs) proactively and reactively reduce the spread of disease. While these measures target individual behaviour, they require broad adherence to be effective. Consequently, the World Health Organization issued a special appeal to young adults, a known non-adherent population, for increased adherence with COVID-19 guidelines. However, little is known about why these low-risk individuals do or do not adhere to PHMs. This study investigates why young adults in a low-risk setting adhered to PHMs implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitative research approach was chosen to gain an in-depth understanding of participants' thoughts and experiences related to PHM adherence. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in April-May 2021 with 30 young adults living in Prince Edward Island (PEI), the province with the lowest COVID-19 case rate in Canada at that time. Thematic analysis was used to create a codebook based on the Theoretical Domains Framework, which was then inductively modified. The analysis identified eight themes that explained the adherence of young adults: (1) clear, purpose-driven adherence rationale, (2) developing trust in the local leadership, (3) adapting to novel measures, (4) manageable disruption, (5) adhering to reduce anxiety, (6) collective duty towards one's community, (7) moral culpability and (8) using caution rather than compliance. Together, these themes demonstrate that young adults adhered to PHMs because of their sense of connection to their community, public health leadership, and concerns over stigma. We further argue that clear guidelines and communication from public health officials during both periods of high and low COVID-19 cases facilitate adherence. These findings are important for mitigating future public health emergencies as they explain why young adults, an important segment of the population whose adherence is critical to the success of PHMs, follow PHMs. Further, these findings can inform public health officials and other stakeholders aiming to develop successful adherence strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4307240311,"HIV incidence continues to increase in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA), in large part due to non-sterile injection drug use, especially within prisons. Therefore, medication-assisted therapy with opioid agonists is an evidence-based HIV-prevention strategy. The Kyrgyz Republic offers methadone within its prison system, but uptake remains low. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is a framework for identifying people who would potentially benefit from methadone, intervening to identify OUD as a problem and methadone as a potential solution, and providing referral to methadone treatment. Using an SBIRT framework, we screened for OUD in Kyrgyz prisons among people who were within six months of returning to the community ( n = 1118). We enrolled 125 people with OUD in this study, 102 of whom were not already engaged in methadone treatment. We conducted a pre-release survey followed by a brief intervention (BI) to address barriers to methadone engagement. Follow-up surveys immediately after the intervention and at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after prison release assessed methadone attitudes and uptake. In-depth qualitative interviews with 12 participants explored factors influencing methadone utilization during and after incarceration. Nearly all participants indicated favorable attitudes toward methadone both before and after intervention in surveys; however, interest in initiating methadone treatment remained very low both before and after the BI. Qualitative findings identified five factors that negatively influence methadone uptake, despite expressed positive attitudes toward methadone: (1) interpersonal relationships, (2) interactions with the criminal justice system, (3) logistical concerns, (4) criminal subculture, and (5) health-related concerns."
https://openalex.org/W4307309272,"High leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) expression caused by an inflammatory condition was reported to promote tumor proliferation and the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in various malignant tumors, but those effects have not been studied in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC) and the molecular mechanism remains unclear. This study was aimed to determine whether YAP/TAZ is involved in the regulation of LGR5 expression in the inflammatory condition. Human hypopharyngeal carcinoma FaDu cells were stimulated with inflammatory medium. The cell invasion ability were evaluated through wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay. The expression levels of EMT-related proteins, LGR5, and p-YAP were detected by real time PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. The results showed that LGR5 expression and the EMT process were significantly enhanced under inflammatory condition. The expression of EMT-related proteins was up-regulated, while that of p-YAP was decreased. After inhibiting the high LGR5 expression with short interfering RNA, the expression of EMT-related proteins was also down-regulated, while that of p-YAP was significantly increased. The use of verteporfin (VP), an inhibitor of YAP activity that promotes YAP phosphorylation, did not affect LGR5 expression. In conclusion, we suggest that the inflammatory condition leads to high LGR5 expression, which up-regulating the expression of EMT-related proteins by inhibiting the YAP phosphorylation."

In Alberta, predators of elk ( Cervus elaphus ), including grizzly bear ( Ursus arctos ), cougar ( Puma concolor ), and wolf ( Canis lupus ), have increased in recent years. We used trend analysis replicated by Wildlife Management Unit (WMU) to examine regional trends in elk harvest and hunter success. Over a 26-yr period, average harvest of elk increased by 5.46% per year for unrestricted bull and by 6.64% per year for limited-quota seasons. Also, over the same time frame, average hunter success increased by 0.2% per year for unrestricted bull and by 0.3% per year for limited-quota seasons, but no trend was detected in hunter effort (P&gt;0.05). Our results show that increasing large-predator populations do not necessarily reduce hunter harvest of elk, and we only found evidence for this in Alberta’s mountain WMUs where predation on elk calves has reduced recruitment. Furthermore, data indicate that Alberta’s elk harvest management has been sustainable, i.e., hunting has continued while populations of elk have increased throughout most of the province. Wildlife agencies can justify commitments to long-term population monitoring because data allow adaptive management and can inform stakeholders on the status of populations."

A Phase I/II HIV vaccine trial enrolls volunteers at low risk of acquiring HIV infection, however a few may still become infected. Understanding the experiences of volunteers who acquired HIV infection while participating in such trials is essential for future research. Here, we describe experiences of HIV infected volunteers in Phase I/II HIV vaccine trials conducted in urban Tanzania. Materials and methods We used a case study design. In-depth interviews were conducted with four participants who became HIV infected during long follow-up visits after completion of vaccination schedules in a Phase I/II trial. Between 3 and 8 years after HIV positive diagnosis, each participant was interviewed at three time points within a two-year interval so as to allow for accumulation of experiences and cross-checking the emerging constructs. Data was analyzed using a qualitative data analysis framework. Results Analysis revealed that participation in HIV vaccine trials involves balancing controversies and the spirit of informed decision. The participants declared that they did not acquire HIV from the experimental vaccine. Disclosure of HIV status within the family was gender specific. Men were hesitant to disclose their HIV status to their sexual partners fearing for the consequences. Women’s attempt to disclose their HIV status yielded negative reactions from the sexual partners. The acquired knowledge from the HIV vaccine research enabled the participants to cope with the uncertainties and their health status. Conclusions The knowledge acquired during the Phase I/II HIV vaccine trial appears to be an essential resource to cope with uncertainties post research. The HIV vaccine trial implementers need to understand the challenges the volunteers may confront after the trial while coping with their health status. Longitudinal studies are essential to trace the effects of uncertainties to the individual participants."
https://openalex.org/W4307313914,"Many real-world networks characterized by power-law degree distributions are extremely vulnerable against malicious attacks. Therefore, it is important to obtain effective methods for strengthening the robustness of the existing networks. Previous studies have been discussed some link addition methods for improving the robustness. In particular, two effective strategies for selecting nodes to add links have been proposed: the minimum degree and longest distance strategies. However, it is unclear whether the effects of these strategies on the robustness are independent or not. In this paper, we investigate the contributions of these strategies to improving the robustness by adding links in distinguishing the effects of degrees and distances as much as possible. Through numerical simulation, we find that the robustness is effectively improved by adding links on the minimum degree strategy for both synthetic trees and real networks. As an exception, only when the number of added links is small, the longest distance strategy is the best. Conversely, the robustness is only slightly improved by adding links on the shortest distance strategy in many cases, even combined with the minimum degree strategy. Therefore, enhancing global loops is essential for improving the robustness rather than local loops."
