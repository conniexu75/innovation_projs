https://openalex.org/W1770991729,"Covalently closed circular RNA molecules (circRNAs) have recently emerged as a class of RNA isoforms with widespread and tissue specific expression across animals, oftentimes independent of the corresponding linear mRNAs. circRNAs are remarkably stable and sometimes highly expressed molecules. Here, we sequenced RNA in human peripheral whole blood to determine the potential of circRNAs as biomarkers in an easily accessible body fluid. We report the reproducible detection of thousands of circRNAs. Importantly, we observed that hundreds of circRNAs are much higher expressed than corresponding linear mRNAs. Thus, circRNA expression in human blood reveals and quantifies the activity of hundreds of coding genes not accessible by classical mRNA specific assays. Our findings suggest that circRNAs could be used as biomarker molecules in standard clinical blood samples."

Anti-B7-H3 mouse monoclonal antibody 8H9 has been successfully used for radioimmunotherapy for patients with B7-H3(+) tumors. We present the humanization, affinity maturation, and epitope mapping of 8H9 based on structure determination, modeling, and yeast display methods. The crystal structure of ch8H9 Fab fragment was solved to 2.5-Å resolution and used as a template for humanization. By displaying the humanized 8H9 single chain Fv (scFv) on the surface of yeast, the affinity was matured by sequential random mutagenesis and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Six mutations (three in the complementarity-determining region and three in the framework regions) were identified and incorporated into an affinity-matured humanized 8H9 construct (hu8H9-6m) and an affinity-matured chimeric 8H9 construct (ch8H9-6m). The hu8H9-6m scFv had a 160-fold improvement in affinity (0.9 nm KD) compared with parental hu8H9 scFv (144 nm KD). The IgG formats of ch8H9-6m and hu8H9-6m (nanomolar to subnanomolar KD) had 2–9-fold enhancements in affinity compared with their parental forms, potent in vitro antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (0.1–0.3 μg/ml EC50), and high tumor uptake in mouse xenografts. Based on in silico docking studies and experimental validation, the molecular epitope of 8H9 was determined to be dependent on the FG loop of B7-H3, a region critical to its function in immunologic blockade and unique among anti-B7-H3 antibodies published to date.

https://openalex.org/W1794191843,"One expression of executive control involves proactive preparation for future events, and this contrasts with stimulus driven reactive control exerted in response to events. Here we describe findings from a response inhibition task, delivered using a smartphone-based platform, that allowed us to index proactive and reactive inhibitory self-control in a large community sample (n = 12,496). Change in stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) when participants are provided with advance information about an upcoming trial, compared to when they are not, provides a measure of proactive control while SSRT in the absence of advance information provides a measure of reactive control. Both forms of control rely on overlapping frontostriatal pathways known to deteriorate in healthy aging, an age-related decline that occurs at an accelerated rate in men compared to women. Here we ask whether these patterns of age-related decline are reflected in similar changes in proactive and reactive inhibitory control across the lifespan. As predicted, we observed a decline in reactive control with natural aging, with a greater rate of decline in men compared to women (~10 ms versus ~8 ms per decade of adult life). Surprisingly, the benefit of preparation, i.e. proactive control, did not change over the lifespan and women showed superior proactive control at all ages compared to men. Our results suggest that reactive and proactive inhibitory control partially rely on distinct neural substrates that are differentially sensitive to age-related change."
https://openalex.org/W2121725552,"The interaction between cytochrome c and the anionic lipid cardiolipin has been proposed as a primary event in the apoptotic signaling cascade. Numerous studies that have examined the interaction of cytochrome c with cardiolipin embedded in a variety of model phospholipid membranes have suggested that partial unfolding of the protein is a precursor to the apoptotic response. However, these studies lacked site resolution and used model systems with negligible or a positive membrane curvature, which is distinct from the large negative curvature of the invaginations of the inner mitochondrial membrane where cytochrome c resides. We have used reverse micelle encapsulation to mimic the potential effects of confinement on the interaction of cytochrome c with cardiolipin. Encapsulation of oxidized horse cytochrome c in 1-decanoyl-rac-glycerol/lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide/hexanol reverse micelles prepared in pentane yields NMR spectra essentially identical to the protein in free aqueous solution. The structure of encapsulated ferricytochrome c was determined to high precision (<r.m.s. deviation>bb ∼ 0.23 Å) using NMR-based methods and is closely similar to the cryogenic crystal structure (<r.m.s. deviation>bb ∼ 1.2 Å). Incorporation of cardiolipin into the reverse micelle surfactant shell causes localized chemical shift perturbations of the encapsulated protein, providing the first view of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction interface at atomic resolution. Three distinct sites of interaction are detected: the so-called A- and L-sites, plus a previously undocumented interaction centered on residues Phe-36, Gly-37, Thr-58, Trp-59, and Lys-60. Importantly, in distinct contrast to earlier studies of this interaction, the protein is not significantly disturbed by the binding of cardiolipin in the context of the reverse micelle.

https://openalex.org/W2172385068,"Protein disulfide isomerase A6 (PDIA6) interacts with protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and inositol requiring enzyme (IRE)-1 and inhibits their unfolded protein response signaling. In this study, shRNA silencing of PDIA6 expression in insulin-producing mouse cells reduced insulin production (5-fold) and, consequently, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (3-4-fold). This inhibition of insulin release was independent of the PDIA6-PERK interaction or PERK activity. Acute inhibition of PERK did not change the short-term response of β cells to glucose. Rather, PDIA6 affected insulin secretion by modulating one of the activities of IRE1. At 11 mM glucose and lower, the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) of the mRNA activity of IRE1 was activated, but not its X-box binding protein (XBP)-1 splicing activity. In the absence of PDIA6, RIDD activity toward insulin transcripts was enhanced up to 4-fold, as shown by molecular assays in cultured cells and the use of a fluorescent reporter in intact islets. Such physiologic activation of IRE1 by glucose contrasted with IRE1 activation by chemical stress, when both IRE1 activities were induced. Thus, whereas the stimulus determines the quality of IRE1 signaling, PDIA6 attenuates multiple enzymatic activities of IRE1, maintaining its signaling within a physiologically tolerable range."
https://openalex.org/W2146670669,"Objective To identify the features of Chinese genetic prion diseases. Methods Suspected Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) cases that were reported under CJD surveillance were diagnosed and subtyped using the diagnostic criteria issued by the WHO. The general information concerning the patient, their clinical, MRI and EEG data, and the results of CSF 14-3-3 and PRNP sequencing were carefully collected from the database of the national CJD surveillance program and analyzed using the SPSS 11.5 statistical software program. Results Since 2006, 69 patients were diagnosed with genetic prion diseases and as having 15 different mutations. The median age of the 69 patients at disease onset was 53.5 years, varying from 19 to 80 years. The majority of patients displaying clinical symptoms were in the 50–59 years of age. FFI, T188K gCJD and E200K were the three most common subtypes. The disease appeared in the family histories of 43.48% of the patients. The clinical manifestations varied considerably among the various diseases. Patients who carried mutations in the N-terminus displayed a younger age of onset, were CSF 14-3-3 negative, had a family history of the condition, and experienced a longer duration of the condition. The clinical courses of T188K were significantly shorter than those of FFI and E200K gCJD, while the symptoms in the FFI group appeared at a younger age and for a longer duration. Moreover, the time intervals between the initial neurologist visit to the final diagnosis were similar among patients with FFI, T188K gCJD, E200K gCJD and other diseases. Conclusion The features of Chinese genetic prion diseases are different from those seen in Europe and other Asian countries."
https://openalex.org/W2157500812,"This nationwide population-based study aims to explore the relationship between polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and subsequent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Data from 1998-2012 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database were used for this study. ICD9-CM codes 256.4X and 648.X were used separately for the diagnoses of PCOS and GDM, which were further confirmed by records of blood tests or ultrasonography to ensure the accuracy of the diagnoses. Women diagnosed at < 15 or > 45 years of age, and those diagnosed with overt diabetes mellitus or GDM prior to PCOS were excluded. During pregnancy, each woman with a previous diagnosis of PCOS was age-matched to 10 women without PCOS. Odds ratios (ORs) for risk of GDM were calculated by logistic regression analysis with adjustment for economic status and co-morbidities.Among 7,629 eligible women with a valid PCOS diagnosis, 3,109 (42.87%) had subsequent pregnancies. GDM occurred frequently among women with a history of PCOS as compared to those without PCOS (20.46% vs. 10.54%, p<0.0001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that PCOS was associated with GDM (adjusted OR = 2.15; 95% CI:1.96-2.37). Among 3,109 affected patients, 1,160 (37.31%) had used medications for PCOS and 261 (8.39%) were treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA). There was no significant difference in development of GDM between the medication and no medication sub-groups (p>0.05). If not used after conception, OHAs did not reduce the risk of GDM (adjusted OR = 1.20; 95% CI:0.88-1.62).A history of PCOS is a significant and independent risk factor for development of GDM. Medication for PCOS or pre-pregnancy use of OHAs does not reduce the risk of GDM. When at-risk women become pregnant, they require closer surveillance for maternal and fetal well-being, and should follow a strict diet and adhere to weight gain control to avoid obstetric complications due to GDM."
https://openalex.org/W1881717934,"Purpose Nucleolar spindle-associated protein (NuSAP1) is an important mitosis-related protein, and aberrant NuSAP1 expression is associated with abnormal spindles and mitosis. This study investigated the prognostic value of NuSAP1 in breast cancer. Methods Two sets of tissue microarrays (TMAs) that included samples from 450 breast cancer patients were constructed, of which 250 patients were training set and the other 200 patients were validation set. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to determine the NuSAP1 levels. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the prognostic value of NuSAP1 in breast cancer. A stepwise Cox analysis was performed to construct a risk-prediction model for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). All statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software. Results There were 108 (43.5%) and 88 (44.0%) patients expressed NuSAP1 in the training set and validation set respectively. High levels of NuSAP1 expression were related to poor disease-free survival (DFS) in both training (P = 0.028) and validation (P = 0.006) cohorts, particularly in TNBC. With combination of two cohorts, both NuSAP1 (HR = 4.136, 95% CI: 1.956–8.747, P < 0.001) and BRCA1 (HR = 0.383, 95% CI: 0.160–0.915, P = 0.031) were independent prognostic indicators of DFS in TNBC. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the combination of NuSAP1 and BRCA1 significantly improved the prognostic power compared with the traditional model (0.778 versus 0.612, P < 0.001). Conclusions Our study confirms the prognostic value of NuSAP1 in breast cancer. The combination of NuSAP1 and BRCA1 could improve the DFS prediction accuracy in TNBC."

There are 23 members of the highly diverse mammalian DHHC protein family, all of which contain a conserved catalytic domain called the cysteine-rich domain (CRD). DHHC proteins transfer palmitate via a two-step catalytic mechanism in which the enzyme first modifies itself with palmitate in a process termed autoacylation. The enzyme then transfers palmitate from itself onto substrate proteins. The number and location of palmitoylated cysteines in the autoacylated intermediate is unknown. In this study, we present evidence using mass spectrometry that DHHC3 is palmitoylated at the cysteine in the DHHC motif. Mutation of highly conserved CRD cysteines outside the DHHC motif resulted in activity deficits and a structural perturbation revealed by limited proteolysis. Treatment of DHHC3 with chelating agents in vitro replicated both the specific structural perturbations and activity deficits observed in conserved cysteine mutants, suggesting metal ion-binding in the CRD. Using the fluorescent indicator mag-fura-2, the metal released from DHHC3 was identified as zinc. The stoichiometry of zinc binding was measured as 2 mol of zinc/mol of DHHC3 protein.

DHHC proteins contain at least four transmembrane domains and a highly conserved cysteine-rich domain (CRD) between transmembrane domains 2 and 3 on the cytoplasmic face of membranes. The signature feature of the CRD is a nearly invariant DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) motif. In vitro, mutation of the cysteine in the DHHC motif blocks both autoacylation and transfer activity of DHHC palmitoyltransferases (11Mitchell D.A. Vasudevan A. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J.

This evidence has led to the hypothesis that this cysteine is the site of autoacylation. However, there is no direct evidence that the cysteine of the DHHC motif is palmitoylated. In cells, DHHC proteins are palmitoylated at steady state, and mutation of the cysteine in the DHHC motif appears to abolish detectable incorporation of palmitate (12Ohno Y. Kashio A. Ogata R. Ishitomi A. Yamazaki Y. Kihara A. Analysis of substrate specificity of human DHHC protein acyltransferases using a yeast expression system.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 4543-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry profiling of palmitoylated proteins in cells has revealed palmitoylation at a conserved cluster of cysteine residues in the C-terminal region of a subset of DHHC proteins (13Yang W.

However, not all DHHC proteins contain these cysteine residues, and other sites of palmitoylation might be present (14Hemsley P.A. Grierson C.S.

The presence of a conserved pattern of cysteine and histidine residues in the CRD originally led to the classification of DHHC proteins as zinc finger proteins (16Böhm S. Frishman D. Mewes H.W.

Recently, a model of the yeast Swf1 DHHC-CRD based on the crystal structure of the ubiquitin-protein ligase Pirh2 suggested that the CRD is built around two CCHC zinc fingers (19González Montoro A. Quiroga R. Valdez Taubas J. Zinc coordination by the DHHC cysteine-rich domain of the palmitoyltransferase Swf1.Biochem. J. 2013; 454: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mutation of the cysteine and histidine residues assigned to the CCHC zinc fingers resulted in loss of function of Swf1 in vivo, and sequence comparisons suggest that there is selective pressure to maintain the CCHC pattern. The model is supported by experimental evidence that an isolated Swf1 DHHC-CRD expressed in bacteria and then purified and refolded in the presence of zinc binds ∼2 mol of zinc/mol of protein (19González Montoro A. Quiroga R. Valdez Taubas J. Zinc coordination by the DHHC cysteine-rich domain of the palmitoyltransferase Swf1.Biochem. J. 2013; 454: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, metal ion binding of an active and intact DHHC protein has not been reported previously. In this study, we performed a structure/function analysis of the seven conserved cysteine residues within the DHHC-CRD using murine DHHC3 as a model enzyme. The CRD of DHHC3 has the pattern of conserved cysteine and histidine residues characteristic of DHHC proteins (Fig. 1A). In prior work (20Jennings B.C. Linder M.E. DHHC proteinS-acyltransferases use similar ping-pong kinetic mechanisms but display different acyl-CoA specificities.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 7236-7245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we have shown that catalytic activity of the enzyme is dependent upon Cys-157, the cysteine of the DHHC motif. However, the role of the other conserved cysteine residues in the function of DHHC3 is unknown. The focus of the present study was to identify sites of palmitoylation and determine whether the DHHC-CRD in an intact and active enzyme contains bound metal ions. We devised a mass spectrometry protocol that enables direct detection of palmitoylated peptides and provides extensive sequence coverage both of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of integral membrane proteins. Using a complementary acyl switch method, we present evidence that DHHC3 is palmitoylated at the DHHC cysteine. We report that DHHC3 binds zinc with a 2:1 zinc/protein stoichiometry and provide biochemical evidence that the highly conserved cysteines within the DHHC3-CRD are required for the structural integrity of the enzyme.

TriEx Sf9 insect cells expressing DHHC3 WT or mutants were disrupted in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% SDS) containing 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide to block free cysteine thiols. DNA was fragmented by passaging the lysate through a 25-gauge syringe needle at least 10 times. The lysate was then cleared by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 20 min. In order to enrich and immobilize DHHC3, the cleared lysate was combined with 30 μl of 50% Ni-NTA resin and rotated for 1 h. The resin was then pelleted; washed three times with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% SDS; and divided into two aliquots. DHHC3 was eluted, palmitate was removed, and newly exposed cysteines were alkylated by rotating Ni-NTA resin with elution buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mm imidazole, 0.8 mm biotin-HPDP, and a 0.5 m concentration of either neutral HA or NaCl for 2 h at room temperature. Following acetone precipitation, DHHC3, suspended in sample buffer, was resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with FITC-streptavidin to detect biotinylation levels and anti-M2 FLAG antibody to detect protein levels. Immunoblots were imaged in a VersaDocTM 5000 system, and relative signal intensities were quantified using QuantityOne software. Affinity-purified DHHC3 protein samples (4 μg) were separated by a 10% SDS gel and stained by Coomassie Blue R250. The DHHC3 bands were excised, cut into ∼1-mm cubes, and subjected to in-gel reduction with 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), alkylation at 10 mm iodoacetamide, and digestion by trypsin at 35 °C overnight. In-gel extraction of tryptic peptides was conducted as reported previously (23Yang Y. Thannhauser T.W. Li L. Zhang S. Development of an integrated approach for evaluation of 2-D gel image analysis: impact of multiple proteins in single spots on comparative proteomics in conventional 2-D gel/MALDI workflow.Electrophoresis. 2007; 28: 2080-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and extracted peptides were reconstituted in 30 μl of 5% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.5% formic acid (FA) for subsequent nano-LC-MS/MS analysis on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass spectrometer-equipped “CorConneX” nano-ion source device (CorSolutions LLC, Ithaca, NY). The nano-LC was carried out by an UltiMate3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo/Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The tryptic peptides (5 μl) were injected at a 20-μl/min flow rate onto a tandem trapping column in which a PepMap C4 trap column (5 μm, 300 μm × 5 mm; Thermo) and a PepMap C18 trap column-nanoViper (5 μm, 100 μm × 2 cm; Thermo) were sequentially connected on the nano-HPLC switch valve for loading digested peptides on both trapping columns depending on their hydrophobicity. The trapped peptides in C4 trapping alone were switched to and separated on a downstream in-house-packed C4 nano-column (75-μm inner diameter × 15 cm, 5-μm particles), which was installed on a CorSolution Nano-device with a 10-μm spray emitter (NewObjective, Woburn, MA). The C4-retained peptides were eluted with a 60-min gradient of 10–72% ACN in 0.1% FA at a flow rate of 300 nl/min, followed by a 5-min ramping to 86% ACN, 0.1% FA and a 5-min hold at 86% ACN, 0.1% FA. Peptides retained on the C18 trapping column were analyzed on a downstream C18 nano-column in a separate MS/MS run with a 60-min gradient of 8–38% ACN in 0.1% FA followed by a 5-min ramping to 80% ACN in 0.1% FA. The Orbitrap Velos was operated in parallel data-dependent acquisition mode using a Fourier transform (FT) mass analyzer for one survey MS scan of precursor ions followed by MS/MS scans on the 10 highest intensity peaks with multiple charged ions above a threshold ion count of 7,500 in both an LTQ mass analyzer and high energy collision dissociation-based FT mass analyzer at 7,500 resolution. MS survey scans were at a resolution of 60,000 (full width at half-maximum at m/z 400) for the mass range of m/z 375–1800. All data were acquired under Xcalibur version 2.1 operation software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS and MS/MS raw spectra were processed using Proteome Discoverer version 1.4 (Thermo), and the spectra from each data-dependent acquisition file were output as an MGF file for subsequent database search using Mascot version 2.3.02 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) against the mouse RefSeq database. The database search was performed with two missed cleavage sites by trypsin allowed. The peptide tolerance was set to 10 ppm, and MS/MS tolerance was set to 0.8 Da for CID and 0.05 Da for high energy collision dissociation. Variable modifications used in database searches include methionine oxidation, deamidation on asparagines/glutamine residues, palmitoylation, and carbamidomethylation on cysteine residue. All spectra of peptides with modified Cys-palmitoylation were manually inspected and confirmed by Xcalibur version 2.1. An acyl switch protocol to prepare samples for mass spectrometry was performed as described for the ABE assay with minor changes. DHHC3 was eluted, palmitate was removed, and newly exposed cysteines were alkylated by rotating Ni-NTA with elution buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25% SDS, 500 mm imidazole, 50 mm iodoacetamide, and 0.5 m neutral HA for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Following precipitation, DHHC3 suspended in sample buffer was resolved by SDS-PAGE. The DHHC3 band was detected with Coomassie Blue staining, excised, and cut into ∼1-mm cubes. The protein was digested in gel with trypsin, and proteolytic peptides were extracted as described above. The peptides were reconstituted in 30 μl of 2% ACN with 0.5% FA, and about 100–200 ng of tryptic digests were loaded onto a PepMap C18 trap column-nanoViper (5 μm, 100 μm × 2 cm; Thermo/Dionex) at a 20-μl/min flow rate and then separated on a PepMap C18 reversed phase nano-column (3 μm, 75 μm × 25 cm; Thermo) for nano-LC-electrospray ionization-MS/MS analysis, on an LTQ-Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were eluted with a 90-min gradient of 5–38% ACN in 0.1% FA at a flow rate of 300 nl/min, followed by a 7-min ramping to 95% ACN, 0.1% FA and a 7-min hold at 95% ACN, 0.1% FA. Similarly, the Orbitrap Elite instrument was operated in data-dependent acquisition under FT-ion trap acquisition mode using an FT mass analyzer for one survey MS scan of precursor ions followed by MS/MS scans on the 15 highest intensity peaks with normalized collision energy of 35%. All acquired MS and MS/MS raw spectra were processed as described above, except N-ethylmaleimide modification of cysteine was included in the database search. All spectra of peptides with carbamidomethyl cysteine were manually inspected and confirmed by Xcalibur version 2.1. TriEx Sf9 insect cells expressing DHHC3-FLAG-His WT or DHHC3 mutants were disrupted in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM), 10% glycerol, 1 mm TCEP, and protease inhibitors). Cleared lysate was then passed three times through an equilibrated 0.5-ml column of Ni-NTA resin, washed with 40 column volumes of lysis buffer and 30 column volumes of lysis buffer containing 15 mm imidazole. Nickel elutions 1 and 2 were performed by applying 1 column volume of elution buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm TCEP, 10% glycerol, 0.1% DDM, and 200 mm imidazole. The imidazole concentration was increased to 500 mm for elutions 3–6. For each elution, the resin was incubated for 10 min in buffer. Elutions were pooled and rotated with ANTI-FLAG® M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% DDM, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A) at 4 °C for 2 h. The FLAG affinity resin was washed five times with a total of 50 column volumes of Buffer A and eluted with 5 × 1 column volumes of Buffer A + 0.3 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The concentration of enzyme was determined by plotting elution samples along a linear curve generated with known concentrations of bovine serum albumin stained with SYPRO® Ruby protein gel stain (Lonza, Rockland, ME) and quantified using a VersaDocTM 5000 imaging system. Purified DHHC3 (20–30 nm) was assayed in a 50-μl reaction with 1 μm [3H]palmitoyl-CoA and 1 μm myristoylated Gαi at 25 °C for 6 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 5× sample buffer containing 10 mm TCEP. Equal amounts of each reaction were resolved on duplicate Coomassie-stained gels. One gel was soaked for 30 min at room temperature in 1 m salicylic acid and 15% methanol, dried, and exposed to film at −70 °C for fluorographic analysis. The substrate bands in the other gel were excised, cut into ∼1-mm cubes, and combined with 500 μl of Soluene 500 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The excised gel bands were then heated at either 37 °C overnight or 50 °C for 3 h before being combined with 4.5 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and counted in a scintillation counter. TriEx Sf9 cells were plated on 60-mm dishes and co-infected with two baculoviruses to co-express WT and mutant forms of DHHC3. The DHHC3 WT construct was C-terminally tagged with three Myc epitopes and 10 histidines. The mutant DHHC3 was hexahistidine- and FLAG-tagged. After 48 h of infection, cells were collected and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors, using a ball bearing homogenizer. The membrane fraction of the lysate was isolated by centrifugation and suspended in lysis buffer with a 25-gauge syringe needle. Each membrane preparation was normalized by total protein concentration and DHHC3 content. Equal amounts of membranes were combined with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA at 1 μm final concentration and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The reactions were stopped with the addition of 5× sample buffer. Equal amounts of the reaction were resolved on duplicate SDS-polyacrylamide gels. One gel was immunoblotted with anti-DHHC3 antibody to detect protein levels of WT and mutant enzymes. The other gel was fixed in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid, stained with Coomassie Blue, and processed for fluorography. Purified WT DHHC3 and DHHC3 mutants were buffer-exchanged into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm TCEP using Sephadex G25 size exclusion resin. DHHC3 was combined with trypsin at a 10:1 ratio and incubated on ice for 45 min. The reaction was stopped with 1× protein sample buffer and a 10-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. The reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE for immunoblots with anti-DHHC3 antibody (Millipore). TriEx Sf9 insect cells (5 × 106 cells) were infected with baculovirus encoding DHHC3 WT and incubated with 0.5 mCi of [3H]palmitate for 2 h. Radiolabeled DHHC3 WT protein was isolated on Ni-NTA resin under non-denaturing conditions. DHHC3 was eluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% DDM, and 500 mm imidazole. The elution was buffer-exchanged into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% DDM, 2 mm TCEP, and 1 mm EDTA using Sephadex G25 size exclusion resin. The eluate from the size exclusion resin was then aliquoted into separate reactions. Each aliquot of protein was exposed to HA, DTT, TCEP, or 1,10-phenanthroline at the concentrations shown in Fig. 6 or with H2O as a control and incubated at 25 °C for 60 min. The reactions were then buffer-exchanged to remove treatment reagents. PAT activity and the limited proteolysis pattern of DHHC3 from each reaction were evaluated as described above. To measure removal of palmitate by the chemical treatments, an aliquot of the reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and processed for fluorography and assayed for protein levels by immunoblot. Radiolabeled protein was quantitated by densitometry and normalized to protein levels in the immunoblot. Measurement of zinc was performed on recombinant DHHC3 that was tagged only with the FLAG epitope to avoid any spurious metal binding from a histidine tag. Insect cells expressing DHHC3-FLAG were lysed with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% DDM, and protease inhibitors. The cell lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to ANTI-FLAG® M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma). After washing with 80 column volumes of wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% DDM) with protease inhibitors and 20 column volumes of wash buffer without protease inhibitors, DHHC3 was eluted with 5 × 1 column volumes of wash buffer without protease inhibitors + 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). Purified DHHC3 was then applied to a preparative size exclusion column (SEC), using wash buffer without protease inhibitors as the mobile phase. Fractions containing a monodispersed DHHC3 peak were collected, pooled, and analyzed by fluorescent size exclusion chromatography (24Kawate T. Gouaux E. Fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography for precrystallization screening of integral membrane proteins.Structure. 2006; 14: 673-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). To evaluate metal ions bound by DHHC3, aliquots of purified DHHC3 were digested with proteinase K overnight at 56 °C and then heated at 90 °C for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, the digested protein sample was combined with 8–16 μm mag-fura-2 (final). Fluorescence emission at 505 nm was monitored while exciting the solution with a spectrum of wavelengths from 300 to 400 nm. The concentration of free zinc ions was calculated from the ratio of fluorescence emitted at the excitation wavelengths 325 and 350 nm (25Simons T.J. Measurement of free Zn2+ ion concentration with the fluorescent probe mag-fura-2 (furaptra).J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1993; 27: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This ratio was then plotted against a standard curve of 325 nm to 350 nm ratios derived from known zinc concentrations generated with an atomic absorption standard of zinc oxide (Fisher). The zinc standard was serially diluted in H2O and added to the same buffer and proteinase K mixture as present in experimental samples. All standard curves were generated and heated in parallel with experimental samples. The protein content of the samples was measured against a standard curve of commercial BSA standards (2 ± 0.03 mg/ml; Pierce) serially diluted in wash buffer without protease inhibitors. The BSA standard curve and experimental samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with SYPRO® Ruby protein gel stain (Lonza, Rockland, ME) and quantified using a VersaDocTM 5000 imaging system. We used mass spectrometry to identify the sites of palmitoylation of DHHC3. Mass spectrometry offers the most accurate and direct means of identifying palmitoylation sites in proteins. However, standard tandem mass spectrometry analysis with upstream reversed phase liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS) has traditionally struggled to directly identify lipid modifications of proteins because hydrophobic interactions between lipid modifications and the commonly used C18 reversed phase HPLC column are frequently too strong to enable elution of lipidated peptides prior to MS/MS analysis (26Ji Y.

https://openalex.org/W2115078500,"The objective of the present study was to investigate the role of high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) in the seizure-induced P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression and the underlying mechanism. Kainic acid (KA)-induced mouse seizure model was used for in vivo experiments. Male C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: normal saline control (NS) group, KA-induced epileptic seizure (EP) group, and EP group pretreated with HMGB1 (EP+HMGB1 group) or BoxA (HMGB1 antagonist, EP+BoxA group). Compared to the NS group, increased levels of HMGB1 and P-gp in the brain were observed in the EP group. Injection of HMGB1 before the induction of KA further increased the expression of P-gp while pre-treatment with BoxA abolished this up-regulation. Next, the regulatory role of HMGB1 and its potential involved signal pathways were investigated in mouse microvascular endothelial bEnd.3 cells in vitro. Cells were treated with HMGB1, HMGB1 plus lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (LPS-RS) [toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist], HMGB1 plus FPS-ZM1 [receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) inhibitor], HMGB1 plus SN50 [nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) inhibitor], or vehicle. Treatment with HMGB1 increased the expression levels of P-gp, TLR4, RAGE and the activation of NF-κB in bEnd.3 cells. These effects were inhibited by the pre-treatment with either LPS-RS or FPS-ZM1, and were abolished by the pre-treatment of SN50 or a combination treatment of both LPS-RS and FPS-ZM1. Luciferase reporter assays showed that exogenous expression of NF-κB p65 increased the promoter activity of multidrug resistance 1a (P-gp-encoding gene) in endothelial cells. These data indicate that HMGB1 contributes to the overexpression of P-gp in mouse epileptic brain tissues via activation of TLR4/RAGE receptors and the downstream transcription factor NF-κB in brain microvascular endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1778165142,"The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation-dependent integrated stress response (ISR), a component of the unfolded protein response, has long been known to regulate intermediary metabolism, but the details are poorly worked out. We report that profiling of mRNAs of transgenic mice harboring a ligand-activated skeletal muscle-specific derivative of the eIF2α protein kinase R-like ER kinase revealed the expected up-regulation of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport but also uncovered the induced expression and secretion of a myokine, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), that stimulates energy consumption and prevents obesity. The link between the ISR and FGF21 expression was further reinforced by the identification of a small-molecule ISR activator that promoted Fgf21 expression in cell-based screens and by implication of the ISR-inducible activating transcription factor 4 in the process. Our findings establish that eIF2α phosphorylation regulates not only cell-autonomous proteostasis and amino acid metabolism, but also affects non-cell-autonomous metabolic regulation by induced expression of a potent myokine."
https://openalex.org/W2116320829,"Background Maternal and infant mortality are highly devastating, yet, in many cases, preventable events for a community. The human development of a country is a strong predictor of maternal and infant mortality, reflecting the importance of socioeconomic factors in determinants of health. Previous research has shown that the Human Development Index (HDI) predicts infant mortality rate (IMR) and the maternal mortality ratio (MMR). Inequality has also been shown to be associated with worse health in certain populations. The main purpose of the present study was to determine the correlation and predictive power of the Inequality Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) as a measure of inequality with the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR), Early Neonatal Mortality Rate (ENMR), Late Neonatal Mortality Rate (LNMR), and the Post Neonatal Mortality Rate (PNMR). Methods and Findings Data for the present study were downloaded from two sources: infant and maternal mortality data were downloaded from the Global Burden of Disease 2013 Cause of Death Database and the Human Development Index (HDI) and Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) data were downloaded from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Pearson correlation coefficients were estimated, following logarithmic transformations to the data, to examine the relationship between HDI and IHDI with MMR, IMR, ENMR, LNMR, and PNMR. Steiger’s Z test for the equality of two dependent correlations was utilized in order to determine whether the HDI or IHDI was more strongly associated with the outcome variables. Lastly, we constructed OLS regression models in order to determine the predictive power of the HDI and IHDI in terms of the MMR, IMR, ENMR, LNMR, and PNMR. Maternal and infant mortality were both strongly and negatively correlated with both HDI and IHDI; however, Steiger’s Z test for the equality of two dependent correlations revealed that IHDI was more strongly correlated than HDI with MMR (Z = 4.897, p < 0.001), IMR (Z = 2.524, p = 0.012), ENMR (Z = 2.936, p = 0.003), LNMR (Z = 2.272, p = 0.023), and PNMR (Z = 2.277, p = 0.023). Furthermore, side-by-side OLS regression models revealed that, when IHDI was used as the predictor variable instead of HDI, the R2 value was 0.053 higher for MMR, 0.025 higher for IMR, 0.038 higher for ENMR, 0.029 higher for LNMR, and 0.026 higher for PNMR. Conclusions Even when both the HDI and the IHDI correlate with the infant and maternal mortality rates, the IHDI is a better predictor for these two health indicators. Therefore, these results add more evidence that inequality is playing an important role in determining the health status of various populations in the world and more efforts should be put into programs to fight inequality."
https://openalex.org/W1887868263,"Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) affect human physiology and pathology by modulating more than 500 proteins. GAG-protein interactions are generally assumed to be ionic and nonspecific, but specific interactions do exist. Here, we present a simple method to identify the GAG-binding site (GBS) on proteins that in turn helps predict high specific GAG–protein systems. Contrary to contemporary thinking, we found that the electrostatic potential at basic arginine and lysine residues neither identifies the GBS consistently, nor its specificity. GBSs are better identified by considering the potential at neutral hydrogen bond donors such as asparagine or glutamine sidechains. Our studies also reveal that an unusual constellation of ionic and non-ionic residues in the binding site leads to specificity. Nature engineers the local environment of Asn45 of antithrombin, Gln255 of 3-O-sulfotransferase 3, Gln163 and Asn167 of 3-O-sulfotransferase 1 and Asn27 of basic fibroblast growth factor in the respective GBSs to induce specificity. Such residues are distinct from other uncharged residues on the same protein structure in possessing a significantly higher electrostatic potential, resultant from the local topology. In contrast, uncharged residues on nonspecific GBSs such as thrombin and serum albumin possess a diffuse spread of electrostatic potential. Our findings also contradict the paradigm that GAG-binding sites are simply a collection of contiguous Arg/Lys residues. Our work demonstrates the basis for discovering specifically interacting and druggable GAG-protein systems based on the structure of protein alone, without requiring access to any structure-function relationship data."
https://openalex.org/W2100079852,"The meniscus root plays an essential role in maintaining the circumferential hoop tension and preventing meniscal displacement. Studies on meniscus root tears have investigated the relationship of osteoarthritis and an anterior cruciate ligament tear. However, few studies have directly compared the medial and lateral root tears. To assess the prevalence of meniscal extrusion and its relationship with clinical features in medial and lateral meniscus root tears, we performed a retrospective review of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results of 42 knee patients who had meniscus posterior horn root tears and who had undergone arthroscopic operations. The presence of meniscal extrusion was evaluated and the exact extent was measured from the tibial margin. The results were correlated with arthroscopic findings. Clinical features including patients' ages, joint abnormalities, and previous trauma histories were evaluated. Twenty-two patients had medial meniscus root tears (MMRTs) and twenty patients had lateral meniscus root tears (LMRTs). Meniscal extrusion was present in 18 MMRT patients and one LMRT patient. The mean extent of extrusion was 4.2mm (range, 0.6 to 7.8) in the MMRT group and 0.9mm (range, -1.9 to 3.4) in the LMRT group. Five patients with MMRT had a history of trauma, while 19 patients with LMRT had a history of trauma. Three patients with MMRT had anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, while 19 patients with LMRT had ACL tears. The mean age of the patients was 52 years (range: 29-71 years) and 30 years (range: 14-62 years) in the MMRT and LMRT group, respectively. There was a significant correlation between a MMRT and meniscal extrusion (p<0.0001), and between an ACL tear and LMRT (p<0.0001). A history of trauma was significantly common in LMRT (p<0.0001). LMRT patients were significantly younger than MMRT patients (p<0.0001). Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grade differed significantly between MMRT and LMRT group (p<0.0001). Meniscal extrusion is common in patients with MMRTs. However, it is rare in patients with LMRTs, which are more commonly associated with a history of trauma and ACL tears."
https://openalex.org/W1779629157,"Vertebrate organisms adapt to a continuously changing environment by regulating the strength of synaptic connections between brain cells. Excitatory synapses are believed to increase their strength by vesicular insertion of transmitter glutamate receptors into the postsynaptic plasma membrane. These vesicles, however, have never been demonstrated or characterized. For the first time, we show the presence of small vesicles in postsynaptic spines, often closely adjacent to the plasma membrane and PSD (postsynaptic density). We demonstrate that they harbor vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2/synaptobrevin-2) and glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluA1). Disrupting VAMP2 by tetanus toxin treatment reduces the concentration of GluA1 in the postsynaptic plasma membrane. GluA1/VAMP2-containing vesicles, but not GluA2/VAMP2-vesicles, are concentrated in postsynaptic spines relative to dendrites. Our results indicate that small postsynaptic vesicles containing GluA1 are inserted directly into the spine plasma membrane through a VAMP2-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2113386471,"The inclusion of intact phospholipids in the diet is essential during larval development and can improve culture performance of many fish species. The effects of supplementation of dietary phospholipid from marine (krill) or plant (soy lecithin) sources were investigated in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar. First feeding fry were fed diets containing either krill oil or soybean lecithin supplying phospholipid at 2.6%, 3.2%, 3.6% and 4.2% of diet. Fish were sampled at ~ 2.5 g (~1,990°day post fertilization, dpf) and ~10 g (2,850°dpf). By comparison of the intestinal transcriptome in specifically chosen contrasts, it was determined that by 2,850°dpf fish possessed a profile that resembled that of mature and differentiated intestinal cell types with a number of changes specific to glycerophospholipid metabolism. It was previously shown that intact phospholipids and particularly phosphatidylcholine are essential during larval development and that this requirement is associated with the inability of enterocytes in young fry to endogenously synthesize sufficient phospholipid for the efficient export of dietary lipid. In the immature phase (~1,990°dpf), the dietary phospholipid content as well as its class composition impacted on several biochemical and morphological parameters including growth, but these differences were not associated with differences in intestinal transcriptomes. The results of this study have made an important contribution to our understanding of the mechanisms associated with lipid transport and phospholipid biosynthesis in early life stages of fish."
https://openalex.org/W2231960554,"UVA radiation (320-400 nm) is a major environmental agent that can exert its deleterious action on living organisms through absorption of the UVA photons by endogenous or exogenous photosensitizers. This leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which in turn can modify reversibly or irreversibly biomolecules, such as lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. We have previously reported that UVA-induced ROS strongly inhibit DNA replication in a dose-dependent manner, but independently of the cell cycle checkpoints activation. Here, we report that the production of 1O2 by UVA radiation leads to a transient inhibition of replication fork velocity, a transient decrease in the dNTP pool, a quickly reversible GSH-dependent oxidation of the RRM1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and sustained inhibition of origin firing. The time of recovery post irradiation for each of these events can last from few minutes (reduction of oxidized RRM1) to several hours (replication fork velocity and origin firing). The quenching of 1O2 by sodium azide prevents the delay of DNA replication, the decrease in the dNTP pool and the oxidation of RRM1, while inhibition of Chk1 does not prevent the inhibition of origin firing. Although the molecular mechanism remains elusive, our data demonstrate that the dynamic of replication is altered by UVA photosensitization of vitamins via the production of singlet oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W2122746315,"This study was designed to demonstrate simultaneous increases in proliferation and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) leading to accelerated vein graft remodeling and to explore the underlying mechanisms.Vein grafts were performed in non-diabetic and diabetic mice. The cultured quiescent VSMCs were subjected to mechanical stretch stress (SS) and/or advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs). Harvested vein grafts and treated VSMCs were used to detect cell proliferation, apoptosis, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation and SM-α-actin expression.Significantly thicker vessel walls and greater increases in proliferation and apoptosis were observed in diabetic vein grafts than those in non-diabetic. Both SS and AGEs were found to induce different activation of three members of MAPKs and simultaneous increases in proliferation and apoptosis of VSMCs, and combined treatment with both had a synergistic effect. VSMCs with strong SM-α-actin expression represented more activated JNKs or p38MAPK, and cell apoptosis, while the cells with weak SM-α-actin expression demonstrated preferential activation of ERKs and cell proliferation. In contrast, inhibition of MAPKs signals triggered significant decreases in VSMC proliferation, and apoptosis. Treatment of the cells with RNA interference of receptor of AGEs (RAGE) also resulted in significant decreases in both proliferation and apoptosis.Increased pressure-induced SS triggers simultaneous increases in proliferation and apoptosis of VSMCs in the vein grafts leading to vein arterializations, which can be synergistically accelerated by high glucose-induced AGEs resulting in vein graft atherosclerosis.

In this study, we evaluate the ability to noninvasively image and quantitate disease pathology using emerging ""hot-spot"" 19F MRI methods in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat, a model of MS. Rats with clinical symptoms of EAE were compared to control rats without EAE, as well as to EAE rats that received daily prophylactic treatments with cyclophosphamide. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoemulsion was injected intravenously, which labels predominately monocytes and macrophages in situ. Analysis of the spin-density weighted 19F MRI data enabled quantification of the apparent macrophage burden in the central nervous system and other tissues. The in vivo MRI results were confirmed by extremely high-resolution 19F/1H magnetic resonance microscopy in excised tissue samples and histopathologic analyses. Additionally, 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of intact tissue samples was used to assay the PFC biodistribution in EAE and control rats. In vivo hot-spot 19F signals were detected predominantly in the EAE spinal cord, consistent with the presence of inflammatory infiltrates. Surprising, prominent 19F hot-spots were observed in bone-marrow cavities adjacent to spinal cord lesions; these were not observed in control animals. Quantitative evaluation of cohorts receiving cyclophosphamide treatment displayed significant reduction in 19F signal within the spinal cord and bone marrow of EAE rats. Overall, 19F MRI can be used to quantitatively monitored EAE disease burden, discover unexpected sites of inflammatory activity, and may serve as a sensitive biomarker for the discovery and preclinical assessment of novel MS therapeutic interventions."

The RNA-binding domain of PUF proteins typically consists of eight clustered Puf repeats. Plant genomes code for large families of PUF proteins that show significant variability in their predicted Puf repeat number, organization, and amino acid sequence. Here we sought to determine whether the observed variability in the RNA-binding domains of four plant PUFs results in a preference for nonclassical PUF RNA target sequences. We report the identification of a novel RNA binding sequence for a nucleolar Arabidopsis PUF protein that contains an atypical RNA-binding domain. The Arabidopsis PUM23 (APUM23) binding sequence was 10 nucleotides in length, contained a centrally located UUGA core element, and had a preferred cytosine at nucleotide position 8. These RNA sequence characteristics differ from those of other PUF proteins, because all natural PUFs studied to date bind to RNAs that contain a conserved UGU sequence at their 5′ end and lack specificity for cytosine. Gel mobility shift assays validated the identity of the APUM23 binding sequence and supported the location of 3 of the 10 predicted Puf repeats in APUM23, including the cytosine-binding repeat. The preferred 10-nucleotide sequence bound by APUM23 is present within the 18S rRNA sequence, supporting the known role of APUM23 in 18S rRNA maturation.

A wide range of fossil vertebrates associated with these facies supports the hypothesis of an estuary in that geographic area connected with a hydrographic system that flowed from western Amazonia up to the Proto-Caribbean Sea during the Miocene. Here the elasmobranch assemblages of the middle Miocene to middle Pliocene section of the Urumaco sequence (Socorro, Urumaco and Codore formations) are described. Based on new findings, we document at least 21 taxa of the Lamniformes, Carcharhiniformes, Myliobatiformes and Rajiformes, and describe a new carcharhiniform species (†Carcharhinus caquetius sp. nov.). Moreover, the Urumaco Formation has a high number of well-preserved fossil Pristis rostra, for which we provide a detailed taxonomic revision, and referral in the context of the global Miocene record of Pristis as well as extant species. Using the habitat preference of the living representatives, we hypothesize that the fossil chondrichthyan assemblages from the Urumaco sequence are evidence for marine shallow waters and estuarine habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2149347342,"The Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP) task, a serial discrimination task where task performance believed to reflect sustained attention capabilities, is widely used in behavioural research and increasingly in neuroimaging studies. To date, functional neuroimaging research into the RVIP has been undertaken using block analyses, reflecting the sustained processing involved in the task, but not necessarily the transient processes associated with individual trial performance. Furthermore, this research has been limited to young cohorts. This study assessed the behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) outcomes of the RVIP task using both block and event-related analyses in a healthy middle aged cohort (mean age = 53.56 years, n = 16). The results show that the version of the RVIP used here is sensitive to changes in attentional demand processes with participants achieving a 43% accuracy hit rate in the experimental task compared with 96% accuracy in the control task. As shown by previous research, the block analysis revealed an increase in activation in a network of frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar regions. The event related analysis showed a similar network of activation, seemingly omitting regions involved in the processing of the task (as shown in the block analysis), such as occipital areas and the thalamus, providing an indication of a network of regions involved in correct trial performance. Frontal (superior and inferior frontal gryi), parietal (precuenus, inferior parietal lobe) and cerebellar regions were shown to be active in both the block and event-related analyses, suggesting their importance in sustained attention/vigilance. These networks and the differences between them are discussed in detail, as well as implications for future research in middle aged cohorts."

High concentrations of HCO3− in the female genital tract induce an increase in sperm beat frequency, which speeds progress of the sperm through the female reproductive tract.

We show that two CA isoforms, CAII and CAIV, are distributed along the epididymal epithelium and appear with the onset of puberty. Expression analyses reveal an up-regulation of CAII and CAIV in the different epididymal sections of the knockout lines. In sperm, we find that CAII is located in the principal piece, whereas CAIV is present in the plasma membrane of the entire sperm tail. CAII and CAIV single knockout animals display an imbalanced HCO3− homeostasis, resulting in substantially reduced sperm motility, swimming speed, and HCO3−-enhanced beat frequency. The CA activity remaining in the sperm of CAII- and CAIV-null mutants is 35% and 68% of that found in WT mice. Sperm of the double knockout mutant mice show responses to stimulus by HCO3− or CO2 that were delayed in onset and reduced in magnitude.

https://openalex.org/W1749320268,"Human voltage-dependent anion channel-2 (hVDAC-2) functions primarily as the crucial anti-apoptotic protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane, and additionally as a gated bidirectional metabolite transporter. The N-terminal helix (NTH), involved in voltage sensing, bears an additional 11-residue extension (NTE) only in hVDAC-2. In this study, we assign a unique role for the NTE as influencing the chaperone-independent refolding kinetics and overall thermodynamic stability of hVDAC-2. Our electrophysiology data shows that the N-helix is crucial for channel activity, whereas NTE sensitizes this isoform to voltage gating. Additionally, hVDAC-2 possesses the highest cysteine content, possibly for regulating reactive oxygen species content. We identify interdependent contributions of the N-helix and cysteines to channel function, and the measured stability in micellar environments with differing physicochemical properties. The evolutionary demand for the NTE in the presence of cysteines clearly emerges from our biochemical and functional studies, providing insight into factors that functionally demarcate hVDAC-2 from the other VDACs."

It is originally derived from the Caribbean marine tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata and currently produced synthetically. Trabectedin is active against a variety of tumor cell lines growing in culture. The present study focused on the effect of trabectedin in cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and spheroid formation in prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs). Cluster of differentiation (CD) 133+high/CD44+high prostate CSCs were isolated from the DU145 and PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line through flow cytometry. We studied the growth-inhibitory effects of trabectedin and its molecular mechanisms on human prostate CSCs and non-CSCs. DU-145 and PC-3 CSCs were treated with 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 nM trabectedin for 24, 48 and 72 h and the growth inhibition rates were examined using the sphere-forming assay. Annexin-V assay and immunofluorescence analyses were performed for the detection of the cell death. Concentration-dependent effects of trabectedin on the cell cycle were also evaluated. The cells were exposed to the different doses of trabectedin for 24, 48 and 72 h to evaluate the effect of trabectedin on the number and diameter of spheroids. According to the results, trabectedin induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis at the IC50 dose, resulting in a significant increase expression of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, p53 and decrease expression of bcl-2 in dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analyses revealed that trabectedin induces dose-dependent G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest, particularly at high-dose treatments. Three-dimensional culture studies showed that trabectedin reduced the number and diameter of spheroids of DU145 and PC3 CSCs. Furthermore, we have found that trabectedin disrupted cell-cell interactions via E-cadherin in prostasphere of DU-145 and PC-3 CSCs. Our results showed that trabectedin inhibits cellular proliferation and accelerates apoptotic events in prostate CSCs; and may be a potential effective therapeutic agent against prostate cancer."

In addition, 3-week-old renal capsular transplants of embryonic day 18.5 Twist2Cre/+;Twist1fl/fl molars showed malformed crowns and cusps with defective crown dentin and enamel. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the implanted mutant molars had defects in odontoblast differentiation and delayed ameloblast differentiation. Furthermore, in vitro ChIP assays demonstrated that Twist1 was able to bind to a specific region of the Fgf10 promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2153815234,"Spectrotemporal modulation (STM) detection performance was examined for cochlear implant (CI) users. The test involved discriminating between an unmodulated steady noise and a modulated stimulus. The modulated stimulus presents frequency modulation patterns that change in frequency over time. In order to examine STM detection performance for different modulation conditions, two different temporal modulation rates (5 and 10 Hz) and three different spectral modulation densities (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 cycles/octave) were employed, producing a total 6 different STM stimulus conditions. In order to explore how electric hearing constrains STM sensitivity for CI users differently from acoustic hearing, normal-hearing (NH) and hearing-impaired (HI) listeners were also tested on the same tasks. STM detection performance was best in NH subjects, followed by HI subjects. On average, CI subjects showed poorest performance, but some CI subjects showed high levels of STM detection performance that was comparable to acoustic hearing. Significant correlations were found between STM detection performance and speech identification performance in quiet and in noise. In order to understand the relative contribution of spectral and temporal modulation cues to speech perception abilities for CI users, spectral and temporal modulation detection was performed separately and related to STM detection and speech perception performance. The results suggest that that slow spectral modulation rather than slow temporal modulation may be important for determining speech perception capabilities for CI users. Lastly, test-retest reliability for STM detection was good with no learning. The present study demonstrates that STM detection may be a useful tool to evaluate the ability of CI sound processing strategies to deliver clinically pertinent acoustic modulation information."

https://openalex.org/W2209954776,"In recent years, Abscisic Acid (ABA) has been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in mammals as an endogenous hormone, by stimulating both insulin release and peripheral glucose uptake. In addition, ABA is released by glucose- or GLP-1-stimulated β-pancreatic cells. Here we investigated whether ABA can stimulate GLP-1 release. The human enteroendocrine L cell line hNCI-H716 was used to explore whether ABA stimulates in vitro GLP-1 secretion and/or transcription. ABA induced GLP-1 release in hNCI-H716 cells, through a cAMP/PKA-dependent mechanism. ABA also enhanced GLP-1 transcription. In addition, oral administration of ABA significantly increased plasma GLP-1 and insulin levels in rats. In conclusion, ABA can stimulate GLP-1 release: this result and the previous observation that GLP-1 stimulates ABA release from β -cells, suggest a positive feed-back mechanism between ABA and GLP-1, regulating glucose homeostasis. Type 2 diabetes treatments targeting the GLP-1 axis by either inhibiting its rapid clearance by dipeptidyl-peptidase IV or using GLP-1 mimetics are currently used. Moreover, the development of treatments aimed at stimulating GLP-1 release from L cells has been considered as an alternative approach. Accordingly, our finding that ABA increases GLP-1 release in vitro and in vivo may suggest ABA and/or ABA analogs as potential anti-diabetic treatments."

To identify the molecular determinants of an effective response to P. aeruginosa infection, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of primary human bronchial epithelial cells from healthy donors (CTRL) 2, 4, and 6 h after induced P. aeruginosa infection. Compared to noninfected cells, infected cells showed changes in gene activity, which were most marked 6 h postinfection and usually consisted in upregulation.By comparing for each time point of infection, the transcriptomic response of epithelial cells from CF patients and healthy donors, we identified 851, 638, 667, and 980 differentially expressed genes 0, 2, 4, and 6 h postinfection, respectively. Gene selection followed by bioinformatic analysis showed that most of the differentially expressed genes, either up- or downregulated, were in the protein-binding and catalytic gene-ontology categories. Finally, we established that the protein products of the genes exhibiting the greatest differential upregulation (CSF2, CCL2, TNF, CSF3, MMP1, and MMP10) between CF patients and CTRL were produced in higher amounts by infected cells from CF patients versus CTRL.The differentially expressed genes in CF patients may constitute a signature for a detrimental inflammatory response and for an inefficient P. aeruginosa host-cell response."
https://openalex.org/W1806585759,"The collectin proteins are innate immune molecules found in high concentrations on the epithelial and endothelial surfaces of the lung. While these proteins are known to have important anti-inflammatory actions in the airways of the lung little is known of their functional importance in the pulmonary circulation. We recently demonstrated that the circulating collectin protein adiponectin has potent anti-inflammatory effects on the lung endothelium, leading us to reason that other structurally related proteins might have similar effects. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the anti-inflammatory actions of C1q in lung endothelial homeostasis and the pulmonary vascular response to LPS or HCl injury. We show that lung endothelium from C1q-deficient (C1q(-/-)) mice expresses higher baseline levels of the vascular adhesion markers ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin when compared with wild-type mice. Further, we demonstrate that these changes are associated with enhanced susceptibility of the lung to injury as evident by increased expression of adhesion markers, enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and augmented neutrophil recruitment. Additionally, we found that C1q(-/-) mice also exhibited enhanced endothelial barrier dysfunction after injury as manifested by decreased expression of junctional adherens proteins and enhanced vascular leakage. Mechanistically, C1q appears to mediate its effects by inhibiting phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and blocking nuclear translocation of the P65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-κB. In summary, our findings indicate a previously unrecognized role for C1q in pulmonary vascular homeostasis and provide added support for the hypothesis that circulating collectin proteins have protective effects on the lung endothelium."

Most patients experience a relapsing-remitting (RR) course, while about 15–20% of patients experience a primary progressive (PP) course. Cognitive impairment affects approximately 40–70% of all MS patients and differences in cognitive impairment between RR-MS and PP-MS have been found. We aimed to compare RR-MS and PP-MS patients in terms of cognitive performance, and to investigate the MRI correlates of cognitive impairment in the two groups using measures of brain volumes and cortical thickness. Fifty-seven patients (42 RR-MS, 15 PP-MS) and thirty-eight matched controls underwent neuropsychological (NP) testing and MRI. PP-MS patients scored lower than RR-MS patients on most of the NP tests in absence of any specific pattern. PP-MS patients showed significantly lower caudate volume. There was no significant difference in MRI correlates of cognitive impairment between the two groups except for a prevalent association with MRI measures of cortical GM injury in RR-MS patients and with MRI measures of subcortical GM injury in PP-MS patients. This suggests that although cognitive impairment results from several factors, cortical and subcortical GM injury may play a different role depending on the disease course."
https://openalex.org/W1750792099,"The transcription of human telomerase gene hTERT is regulated by transcription factors (TFs), including Sp1 family proteins, and its chromatin environment. To understand its regulation in a relevant chromatin context, we employed bacterial artificial chromosome reporters containing 160 kb of human genomic sequence containing the hTERT gene. Upon chromosomal integration, the bacterial artificial chromosomes recapitulated endogenous hTERT expression, contrary to transient reporters. Sp1/Sp3 expression did not correlate with hTERT promoter activity, and these TFs bound to the hTERT promoters in both telomerase-positive and telomerase-negative cells. Mutation of the proximal GC-box resulted in a dramatic decrease of hTERT promoter activity, and mutations of all five GC-boxes eliminated its transcriptional activity. Neither mutations of GC-boxes nor knockdown of endogenous Sp1 impacted promoter binding by other TFs, including E-box-binding proteins, and histone acetylation and trimethylation of histone H3K9 at the hTERT promoter in telomerase-positive and -negative cells. The result indicated that promoter binding by Sp1/Sp3 was essential, but not a limiting step, for hTERT transcription. hTERT transcription required a permissive chromatin environment. Importantly, our data also revealed different functions of GC-boxes and E-boxes in hTERT regulation; although GC-boxes were essential for promoter activity, factors bound to the E-boxes functioned to de-repress hTERT promoter."

While pigeons tend to maintain their relative position within the flock on average, as in the parallel-path approximation, those who turn later also get behind as in the equal-radius case. Equal-radius type turning also tends to be expressed more during smaller radius turns."

The presence of RA and cIMT were not associated (univariate analysis). Multivariable regression analysis showed that cIMT in RA patients was associated with age (B = 0.006, P<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (B = 0.003, P = 0.003). In controls, cIMT was associated with age (B = 0.006, P<0.001) and smoking (B = 0.097, P = 0.001).cIMT values were similar between RA patients and controls.

We used simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models to investigate the explanatory power of several predictors in explaining the diversity-elevation relationships shown in genera with different biogeographical affinities. Delta akaike information criterion (ΔAIC) was used for multi-model inferences and selections. Our results showed that both the total and tropical genus diversity peaked below the mid-point of the elevational gradient, whereas that of temperate genera had a nearly symmetrical, unimodal relationship with elevation. The proportion of temperate genera increased markedly with elevation, while that of tropical genera declined. Compared to tropical genera, temperate genera had wider elevational ranges and were observed at higher elevations. Water-related variables, rather than mid-domain effects (MDE), were the most significant predictors of elevational patterns of tropical genus diversity. The temperate genus diversity was influenced by energy availability, but only in quadratic terms of the models. Though climatic factors and mid-domain effects jointly explained most of the variation in the diversity of temperate genera with elevation, the former played stronger roles. Total genus diversity was most strongly influenced by climate and the floristic overlap of tropical and temperate floras, while the influences of mid-domain effects were relatively weak. The influences of water-related and energy-related variables may vary with biogeographical affinities. The elevational patterns may be most closely related to climatic factors, while MDE may somewhat modify the patterns. Caution is needed when investigating the causal factors underlying diversity patterns for large taxonomic groups composed of taxa of different biogeographical affinities. Right-skewed diversity-elevation patterns may be produced by the differential response of taxa with varying biogeographical affinities to climatic factors and MDE."

Fibrils ultimately form at a much higher concentration but have widths approximately twice that of Aβ18–35, suggesting an opening of the hairpin bend. Surprisingly, two-dimensional solid state NMR shows that the contact between Phe19 and Leu34 residues, observed in full-length Aβ and Aβ18–35, is still intact in these fibrils. This is possible if the monomers in the fibril are arranged in an antiparallel β-sheet conformation. Indeed, IR measurements, supported by tyrosine cross-linking experiments, provide a characteristic signature of the antiparallel β-sheet. We conclude that the self-assembly of Aβ is critically dependent on the hairpin turn and on the contact between the Phe19 and Leu34 regions, making them potentially sensitive targets for Alzheimer's therapeutics. Our results show the importance of specific conformations in an aggregation process thought to be primarily driven by nonspecific hydrophobic interactions. Aβ self-assembles into parallel cross-β fibrillar aggregates, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. A central hairpin turn around residues 23–29 is a defining characteristic of Aβ in its aggregated state. Major biophysical properties of Aβ, including this turn, remain unaltered in the central fragment Aβ18–35.

Engl. 2014; 53: 6888-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Chemically constraining the side chains of Asp23 and Lys28 accelerates the kinetics of Aβ aggregation by stabilizing the hairpin structure (5Lührs T. Ritter C. Adrian M. Riek-Loher D. Bohrmann B. Döbeli H. Schubert D. Riek R. 3D structure of Alzheimer's amyloid-β(1–42) fibrils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17342-17347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). On the other hand, introducing a negative charge at Ser26 disrupts the Asp23–Lys28 salt bridge, reduces the plasticity of the turn region (Gly25–Gly29), and stabilizes the soluble monomeric and oligomeric assemblies of Aβ (19Rezaei-Ghaleh N. Amininasab M. Giller K. Kumar S. Stündl A. Schneider A. Becker S. Walter J. Zweckstetter M. Turn plasticity distinguishes different modes of amyloid-β aggregation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 4913-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This hairpin turn thus seems to be a critical factor dictating the self-assembly of Aβ under physiological conditions. Studying the influence of the turn region on the properties of Aβ, separately from that of the distal terminal regions and without changing the electrostatics, can yield valuable information on the logic of Aβ assembly. amyloid β(40) amyloid β(18–35) amyloid β(18–35) amyloid β(18–35) minus the residue Gly25 amyloid β(18–35) minus the residue Gly29 amyloid β(18–35) with P instead of Gly25 amyloid β(40) minus the residue Gly25 transmission electron microscopy magic angle spinning phase-alternated recoupling irradiation scheme fluorescence correlation spectroscopy solid state NMR thioflavin-T rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy correlation spectroscopy. Aβ aggregation appears to be primarily hydrophobic in nature. In fact a contact between hydrophobic regions containing Phe19 and Leu34 is one of the earliest contacts formed during the aggregation of amyloid β (18Sarkar B. Mithu V.S. Chandra B. Mandal A. Chandrakesan M. Bhowmik D. Madhu P.K. Maiti S. Significant structural differences between transient amyloid-β oligomers and less-toxic fibrils in regions known to harbor familial Alzheimer's mutations.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2014; 53: 6888-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In a generic hydrophobic aggregate, the burial of the hydrophobic surface can in principle proceed in an intermolecular fashion, which would appear to render the turn unnecessary. However, such “straight chain” hydrophobic interactions would end up sandwiching the charged midsection between the two hydrophobic flanking regions (type II; Fig. 1), which would be energetically costly. A hairpin-shaped aggregate on the other hand relieves the hydrophilic region from such constraints by exposing the turn region (type I; Fig. 1). It is likely that the glycine residue in the turn region, Gly25, facilitates the hairpin bend, because it allows the peptide to have enough space to avoid steric hindrance. If Gly25 is removed altogether, the peptide will not have significantly different hydrophobicity, but a tight turn would likely be sterically unfavorable. The neighboring residues Ser26 and Val24 have bulky side chains and may find it difficult to fit within a tight turn without Gly25. Consequently, those properties that depend on the turn will change. We have earlier studied the 18–35 fragment of Aβ (Aβ18–35, hereafter called S), which has shown that the turn can form without any contribution from the terminal regions, and the solubility and other biophysical properties of the peptide remain similar to that of Aβ (20Chandrakesan M. Sarkar B. Mithu V.S. Abhyankar R. Bhowmik D. Nag S. Sahoo B. Shah R. Gurav S. Banerjee R. Dandekar S. Jose J.C. Sengupta N. Madhu P.K. Maiti S. The basic structural motif and major biophysical properties of amyloid-β are encoded in the fragment 18–35.Chem. Phys. 2013; 422: 80-87Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Here we study a mutant of the Aβ18–35 fragment, lacking the residue Gly25 (18VFFAEDV24_26SNKGAIIGLM35, hereafter called SΔG25; residue numbers are according to the full-length Aβ). If aggregation is critically dependent on the formation of the turn, then this mutation is expected to result in a more soluble peptide, having very different physical and biological properties. If it forms the fibrils at all, it would be interesting to investigate whether it forms parallel (type IIA; Fig. 1) or antiparallel (type IIB; Fig. 1) fibrils without a turn or whether it is similar to S, which makes fibrils containing a hairpin turn just like Aβ (type I; Fig. 1). To verify our hypothesis, we have determined the biophysical properties of SΔG25, and these characteristics were compared with those of S, determined earlier (20Chandrakesan M. Sarkar B. Mithu V.S. Abhyankar R. Bhowmik D. Nag S. Sahoo B. Shah R. Gurav S. Banerjee R. Dandekar S. Jose J.C. Sengupta N. Madhu P.K. Maiti S. The basic structural motif and major biophysical properties of amyloid-β are encoded in the fragment 18–35.Chem. Phys. 2013; 422: 80-87Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition, many of the properties were also compared with those of ΔG29 and G25P mutants of S (hereafter called SΔG29 and SG25P, respectively) and the ΔG25 mutant of full-length Aβ40 (hereafter called AβΔG25). SΔG29 examines whether the position of the glycine deletion is critical. The behavior of SG25P on the other hand would tend to force a turn (in the monomers containing the cis form of the proline) or open up the turn (for the trans form). The aggregation kinetics and solubility of the peptides were studied by measuring optical absorbance of the centrifuged supernatant as a function of time. The sizes of the monomers and the formation of oligomeric aggregates in the solution were measured using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), using fluorescently labeled peptides. The secondary conformation of the peptides in the solution state is probed using thioflavin-T (thio-T) binding, CD, and solution state NMR. The effect of S and SΔG25 on the aggregation and fibril formation traits of Aβ40 were probed by performing cross-seeding experiments with peptide mixtures. The morphology of the aggregates formed by SΔG25 and AβΔG25 were probed by transmission electron microscopy. Conformations of the aggregates were assessed with the help of IR and solid state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy. The intermolecular arrangements were specifically probed by cross-linking neighboring tyrosine residues, which assays in-register parallel β-sheet arrangements. The results yielded by these studies help us determine the role played by the hairpin turn in general, and the Phe19–Leu34 interaction in particular (21Adler J. Scheidt H.A. Krüger M. Thomas L.

The isotopically labeled peptides for ssNMR studies were synthesized by the same procedure but with selective introduction of uniformly 13C and 15N isotopically enriched Val18, Phe19, Ala21, Gly33, and Leu34 amino acids. The peptides were dissolved and adjusted to pH 12 with NaOH at different concentrations ranging from 1 to 2 mm and incubated for 30 min. The peptide is mostly in the monomeric or small oligomeric form in basic conditions (24Teplow D.B. Preparation of amyloid β-protein for structural and functional studies.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 413: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Then it was mixed with 20 mm phosphate buffer (containing 146 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, and 20 mm Na2HPO4) maintained at pH 7.4. Sodium azide (anti-bacterial) concentration in buffer is kept at 0.5 mm. The dilution factor was usually 10, and the final pH of the solution was verified to be within 0.1 pH unit of 7.4. The time of mixing was considered as the zero time of aggregation, and concentration was measured using the absorbance at 230 nm using the peptide backbone as a probe of concentration and also by tyrosine fluorescence in case of Aβ and AβΔG25. The solutions were constantly rotated at 20 rpm at room temperature (298 K). The initial reading was recorded without any centrifugation immediately after mixing. Later time points are measured from the supernatant of sample centrifuged at 2000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed back with the precipitate after each measurement and rotated in a centrifuge tube with rpm of 20 for efficient mixing. The aggregation was studied for 7 days. Jasco double beam absorption spectrophotometer (model no. V-530; Jasco) was used for all measurements with necessary day to day blank corrections. To assess the effect of possible cross-seeding, aggregation kinetics of 100 μm Aβ40 in presence of 100 μm S or SΔG25 were monitored using the fluorescence of tyrosine remaining in the supernatant with time. FCS measurements were performed on a home-built instrument and following the methods established earlier (25Sengupta P. Balaji J. Maiti S. Measuring diffusion in cell membranes by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.Methods. 2002; 27: 374-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Tetramethylrhodamine-labeled peptides were used at a concentration ratio of 1:1000 (labeled:unlabeled) as fluorescent markers for the peptide aggregates. MEMFCS, a fitting routine developed specifically for such measurements (26Sengupta P. Garai K. Balaji J. Periasamy N. Maiti S. Measuring size distribution in highly heterogeneous systems with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1977-1984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), was used to obtain a size distribution from the FCS data in a model-free manner. The instrument was calibrated using the dye rhodamine B. CD measurements were performed on 100 μm peptide solution incubated in 2 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 for 6 and 16 h. The solutions were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 20 min. The measurements were performed with the solutions both before centrifugation and after centrifugation (with the supernatant). Far UV CD spectra for the peptides were measured over a range of 195–260 nm in a cuvette of 1-mm path length in a J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco). Peptide samples (100 μm each) were prepared in phosphate buffer (pH ∼7.4) containing 5 μm thio-T. The peptide samples were diluted from pH 11 aqueous solution. thio-T fluorescence from the samples were recorded in a FluoroMax 3 spectrofluorimeter (Horiba Scientific) using 444-nm excitation as a function of time after preparation of the sample in pH 7.4 buffer. Solutions containing 1 mm SΔG25 or 100 μm AβΔG25 at pH 7.4 phosphate buffer were incubated at room temperature for 72 h. 10 μl of these solutions were placed on carbon-coated 100 mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and allowed to be adsorbed for 2–3 min. The grids were blotted and mildly washed with MilliQ water three or four times. Then the samples were stained by 0.1% of uranyl acetate followed by drying under an infrared lamp. The samples were examined with a transmission electron microscope (LIBRA 120, EFTEM; Carl Zeiss). The fibril widths were analyzed with ImageJ (open source software). A 400 μm solution of SΔG25 peptide incubated overnight was subjected to solution state NMR measurements. All measurements were performed on 500-MHz Buker AVIII spectrometer using a 5-mm double channel direct probe equipped with Z-gradients. For ssNMR measurements, selective isotopically enriched peptide was allowed to aggregate from a starting concentration of 1–2 mm in the similar buffer system used for solubility measurements. The aggregates were isolated from the soluble peptide by centrifugation for 1 h. The pellet thus collected was washed with deionized water twice by resuspending it in water and centrifuging for 1 h each time. The final pellet so obtained was rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, and packed in a 2.5-mm magic angle spinning (MAS) rotor. All ssNMR measurements were performed on 700-MHz Bruker AVIII NMR spectrometer at MAS frequency (νr) of 12 and 17 kHz using a 2.5-mm triple resonance MAS probe. 1H dipolar decoupling was accomplished using swept frequency, two-pulse phase modulation (φ = 15°) decoupling scheme (27Thakur R.S. Kurur N.D. Madhu P.K. Swept-frequency two-pulse phase modulation for heteronuclear dipolar decoupling in solid-state NMR.Chem. Phys. Lett. 2006; 426: 459-463Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional 13C-13C through-space NMR spectra were recorded using second order dipolar recoupling schemes of PARIS-xy (m = 1, n = 0.5) (28Weingarth M. Demco D.E. Bodenhausen G. Tekely P. Improved magnetization transfer in solid-state NMR with fast magic angle spinning.Chem. Phys. Lett. 2009; 469: 342-348Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and mixing periods of 20 (at νr = 17 kHz) and 320 (at νr = 12 and 17 kHz) ms, respectively. All one-dimensional data were processed and analyzed using TopSpin 3.2. All two-dimensional spectra were processed with TopSpin 3.2 and analyzed using Analysis 2.3.1 (29Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D. The CCPN data model for NMR spectroscopy: development of a software pipeline.Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar). Secondary chemical shifts were calculated by subtracting the temperature and pH adjusted sequence-corrected random coil chemical shifts from the observed chemical shifts for each amino acid (30Kjaergaard M.

All the solutions were subsequently centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were discarded. Precipitates so obtained were lyophilized and subjected to IR studies. The FTIR spectra of all the samples were recorded in a Nicolet 6700 FTIR instrument (Thermo Electron Corporation). We prepared separate peptides with one extra tyrosine residue at the N terminus of S and SΔG25 for these experiments. 200 μm of Aβ1–40, 200 μm of tyr-S, and 1 mm of tyr-SΔG25 were incubated for 14 days in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 2 mm NaN3; pH adjusted by adding HCl). Aggregates so obtained were separated by mild centrifugation (2000 × g for 10 min), discarding the supernatant. Aggregates were then resuspended in appropriate amount of phosphate buffer, so that all vortexed solutions had similar tyrosine fluorescence (which ensures matching final peptide concentrations). 10 μl of ice-cold H2O2 and 6 μl of freshly prepared FeSO4 were added simultaneously to 600 μl of these peptide solutions. These solutions were then vortexed for 60 s. Fluorescence spectra were obtained immediately by exciting at 260 nm. Although tyrosine has a fluorescence peak at ∼305 nm, the cross-linked tyrosine peak is in the visible region. A similar experiment was performed with a similar concentration of free tyrosine solution to estimate the extent of random cross-linking in solution. The spectra were normalized by dividing them by the fluorescence intensity obtained at 305 nm before the cross-linking step. To remove the contribution from random cross-linking, the normalized spectra obtained from free tyrosine were subtracted from these normalized spectra. Aggregation kinetics of the different peptides were compared by monitoring the concentration remaining in solution after gentle centrifugation (2000 × g for 20 min; Fig. 2A). The concentration is measured by recording the absorbance of the supernatant at 230 nm. The saturation concentration (Csat) is the limiting value of the concentration remaining in the solution after the solution is incubated for a sufficiently long time (32Sengupta P. Garai K. Sahoo B. Shi Y. Callaway D.J. Maiti S. The amyloid β peptide (Aβ(1–40)) is thermodynamically soluble at physiological concentrations.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10506-10513Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). SΔG25 was found to reach a Csat of 566 ± 150 μm in 7 days. S on the other hand attains a Csat of ∼18 ± 2 μm over a similar period, which is close to the full-length Aβ40 (∼12 ± 4 μm). Thus, deletion of a single residue Gly25 caused the solubility of Aβ18–35 fragment to increase by more than 20 times under physiological buffer conditions. The same deletion in the case of the full-length peptide also leads to a 3-fold increase in solubility (AβΔG25 solubility = 36 ± 12 μm; Fig. 2A). This increase is less than that of SΔG25 but still very substantial. We also examined two more peptide variants: SΔG29 and SG25P mutants of S. They were found to reach saturation concentrations of 9 ± 1 and 20 ± 4 μm (Fig. 2A), respectively. Therefore, both the nature and the location of a glycine residue are critical for peptide aggregation. If the turn favors aggregation, then we expect that initially the aggregation kinetics of SG25P may be slow (for the trans population), but with time the trans form may isomerize to the cis form (the kinetics of such a cis-trans isomerization in an ordered aggregate may be slow), and the solubility may finally become similar to that of the wild type. This is indeed corroborated by the data. Next we probed the effect of Gly25 deletion on the soluble oligomeric species of the S. The size of this species was determined by performing FCS measurements using tetramethylrhodamine-labeled peptides as probes. FCS, in different forms, has proved to be an effective tool for following the size of evolving protein aggregates (32Sengupta P. Garai K. Sahoo B. Shi Y. Callaway D.J. Maiti S.

https://openalex.org/W2168903530,"Characterization of host-pathogen interactions is a fundamental approach in microbiological and immunological oriented disciplines. It is commonly accepted that host cells start to change their phenotype after engulfing pathogens. Techniques such as real time PCR or ELISA were used to characterize the genes encoding proteins that are associated either with pathogen elimination or immune escape mechanisms. Most of such studies were performed in vitro using primary host cells or cell lines. Consequently, the data generated with such approaches reflect the global RNA expression or protein amount recovered from all cells in culture. This is justified when all host cells harbor an equal amount of pathogens under experimental conditions. However, the uptake of pathogens by phagocytic cells is not synchronized. Consequently, there are host cells incorporating different amounts of pathogens that might result in distinct pathogen-induced protein biosynthesis. Therefore, we established a technique able to detect and quantify the number of pathogens in the corresponding host cells using immunofluorescence-based high throughput analysis. Paired with multicolor staining of molecules of interest it is now possible to analyze the infection profile of host cell populations and the corresponding phenotype of the host cells as a result of parasite load."
https://openalex.org/W1860595737,"The influence of spring stiffness and valve quality on the motion behaviors of reciprocating plunger pump discharge valves was investigated by fluid structure interaction (FSI) simulation and experimental analysis. The mathematical model of the discharge valve motion of a 2000-fracturing pump was developed and the discrete differential equations were solved according to FSI and results obtained by ANDINA software. Results indicate that spring stiffness influences the maximum lift, the opening resistance and shut-off lag angle, as well as the fluid velocity of the clearance, the impact stress and the volume efficiency of the pump valve in relation to the valve quality. An optimal spring stiffness parameter of 14.6 N/mm was obtained, and the volumetric efficiency of the pumping valve increased by 4‰ in comparison to results obtained with the original spring stiffness of 10.09N/mm. The experimental results indicated that the mathematical model and FSI method could provide an effective approach for the subsequent improvement of valve reliability, volumetric efficiency and lifespan."

In 2009 and 2011, 7 full days of pedometer data were collected from cross-sectional samples of grade 5 students (age 10-11 years) from 10 intervention schools in low-socioeconomic neighbourhoods and 20 comparison schools in middle-socioeconomic neighbourhoods. Multilevel models assessed differences in step-counts between intervention and comparison groups over-time by weight (objectively measured) and socioeconomic status subgroups.In 2009, children from intervention schools were less active on weekends relative to comparison schools (9212 vs. 11186 steps/day p<0.01). Two years later, daily step-counts on weekend days among children in low socioeconomic intervention schools increased such that they approximated those of children from middle socioeconomic comparison schools (12148 vs. 12121 steps/day p = 0.96). The relative difference in steps between intervention and comparison schools on weekends reduced from -21.4% to 0.2% following the intervention. The normalization of weekend step counts was similar for normal weight (-21.4% to +2.0%) and overweight (-19.1 to +3.9%) children, and was balanced across socioeconomic subgroups.These data suggest that school-based health promotion is effective for reducing inequities in physical activity levels outside school hours. Investments in school-based health promotion lead to behavior modification beyond the school environment.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01914185."
https://openalex.org/W1855146189,"Colonial corals occur in a wide range of marine benthic habitats from the shallows to the deep ocean, often defining the structure of their local community. The black coral Leiopathes glaberrima is a long-lived foundation species occurring on carbonate outcrops in the Northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Multiple color morphs of L. glaberrima grow sympatrically in the region. Morphological, mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal markers supported the hypothesis that color morphs constituted a single biological species and that colonies, regardless of color, were somewhat genetically differentiated east and west of the Mississippi Canyon. Ten microsatellite loci were used to determine finer-scale population genetic structure and reproductive characteristics. Gene flow was disrupted between and within two nearby (distance = 36.4 km) hardground sites and two sympatric microsatellite lineages, which might constitute cryptic species, were recovered. Lineage one was outbred and found in all sampled locations (N = 5) across 765.6 km in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Lineage two was inbred, reproducing predominantly by fragmentation, and restricted to sites around Viosca Knoll. In these sites the lineages and the color phenotypes occurred in different microhabitats, and models of maximum entropy suggested that depth and slope influence the distribution of the color phenotypes within the Vioska Knolls. We conclude that L. glaberrima is phenotypically plastic with a mixed reproductive strategy in the Northern GoM. Such strategy might enable this long-lived species to balance local recruitment with occasional long-distance dispersal to colonize new sites in an environment where habitat is limited."
https://openalex.org/W2132917638,"Many colour polymorphisms are present only in one sex, usually males, but proximate mechanisms controlling the expression of sex-limited colour polymorphisms have received little attention. Here, we test the hypothesis that artificial elevation of testosterone in females of the colour polymorphic tawny dragon lizard, Ctenophorus decresii, can induce them to express the same colour morphs, in similar frequencies, to those found in males. Male C. decresii, express four discrete throat colour morphs (orange, yellow, grey and an orange central patch surrounded by yellow). We used silastic implants to experimentally elevate testosterone levels in mature females to induce colour expression. Testosterone elevation resulted in a substantial increase in the proportion and intensity of orange but not yellow colouration, which was present in a subset of females prior to treatment. Consequently, females exhibited the same set of colour morphs as males, and we confirmed that these morphs are objectively classifiable, by using digital image analyses and spectral reflectance measurements, and occur in similar frequencies as in males. These results indicate that the influence of testosterone differs for different colours, suggesting that their expression may be governed by different proximate hormonal mechanisms. Thus, caution must be exercised when using artificial testosterone manipulation to induce female expression of sex-limited colour polymorphisms. Nevertheless, the ability to express sex-limited colours (in this case orange) to reveal the same, objectively classifiable morphs in similar frequencies to males suggests autosomal rather than sex-linked inheritance, and can facilitate further research on the genetic basis of colour polymorphism, including estimating heritability and selection on colour morphs from pedigree data."
https://openalex.org/W1947222242,"A central mechanism participates in sympathetic overdrive during insulin resistance (IR). Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and nitric oxide (NO) modulate sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which influences the autonomic regulation of cardiovascular responses. The aim of this study was to explore whether the NO system in the PVN is involved in the modulation of SNA in fructose-induced IR rats. Control rats received ordinary drinking water, whereas IR rats received 12.5% fructose-containing drinking water for 12 wks to induce IR. Basal SNA was assessed based on the changes in renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in response to chemicals administered to the PVN. We found an increased plasma norepinephrine level but significantly reduced NO content and neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) protein expression levels in the PVN of IR rats compared to Control rats. No difference in inducible NOS (iNOS) protein expression was observed between the two groups. In anesthetized rats, the microinjection of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, or Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a non-selective inhibitor of NOS, into the PVN significantly decreased and increased basal SNA, respectively, in both normal and IR rats, but these responses to SNP and L-NAME in IR rats were smaller than those in normal rats. The administration of selective inhibitors of nNOS or eNOS, but not iNOS, to the PVN significantly increased basal SNA in both groups, but these responses were also smaller in IR rats. Moreover, IR rats exhibited reduced nNOS and eNOS activity in the PVN. In conclusion, these data indicate that the decreased protein expression and activity levels of nNOS and eNOS in the PVN lead to a reduction in the NO content in the PVN, thereby contributing to a subsequent enhancement in sympathoexcitation during IR."
https://openalex.org/W2152783831,"Immune responses are efficient because the rare antigen-specific naïve cells are able to proliferate extensively and accumulate upon antigen stimulation. Moreover, differentiation into memory cells actually increases T cell accumulation, indicating improved productive division in secondary immune responses. These properties raise an important paradox: how T cells may survive the DNA lesions necessarily induced during their extensive division without undergoing transformation. We here present the first data addressing the DNA damage responses (DDRs) of CD8 T cells in vivo during exponential expansion in primary and secondary responses in mice. We show that during exponential division CD8 T cells engage unique DDRs, which are not present in other exponentially dividing cells, in T lymphocytes after UV or X irradiation or in non-metastatic tumor cells. While in other cell types a single DDR pathway is affected, all DDR pathways and cell cycle checkpoints are affected in dividing CD8 T cells. All DDR pathways collapse in secondary responses in the absence of CD4 help. CD8 T cells are driven to compulsive suicidal divisions preventing the propagation of DNA lesions. In contrast, in the presence of CD4 help all the DDR pathways are up regulated, resembling those present in metastatic tumors. However, this up regulation is present only during the expansion phase; i.e., their dependence on antigen stimulation prevents CD8 transformation. These results explain how CD8 T cells maintain genome integrity in spite of their extensive division, and highlight the fundamental role of DDRs in the efficiency of CD8 immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2197210247,"Background End stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are characterized by increased morbidity and mortality due to highest prevalence of cardiovascular disease. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an inflammatory cytokine that controls cellular signaling in human physiology, pathophysiology, and diseases. Increased MIF plasma levels promote vascular inflammation and development of atherosclerosis. We have shown that MIF is associated with vascular dysfunction in ESRD patients. Whether hemodialysis (HD) affects circulating MIF plasma levels is unknown. We here aimed to investigate whether HD influences the circulating MIF pool in ESRD patients. Methods and Results An observational single-center study was conducted. MIF plasma levels in ESRD patients were assessed before, during, and after a HD session (n = 29). Healthy age-matched volunteers served as controls to compare correlations of MIF plasma levels with inflammatory plasma components (n = 20). MIF removed from the circulating blood pool could be detected in the dialysate and allowed for calculation of totally removed MIF (MIF content in dialysate 219±4 μg/HD-session). MIF plasma levels were markedly decreased 2 hour after initiation of HD (MIF plasma level pre-HD 84.8±6 ng/ml to intra-HD 61.2±5 ng/ml p<0.001) and were replenished already 20 min after termination of HD to basal levels (intra-HD 61.2±5 ng/ml to post-HD 79.8±5 ng/ml, p<0.001). Conclusion MIF is a dialyzable plasma component that is effectively filtrated during HD from the patient blood pool in large amounts. After removal of remarkable amounts of MIF during a single HD session, MIF plasma pool is early reconstituted after termination of HD from unknown sources."
https://openalex.org/W1783300432,"In deep-sea geothermal rift zones, the dispersal of hydrothermal fluids of moderately-high temperatures typically forms subseafloor mounds. Major mineral components of the crust covering the mound are barite and metal sulfides. As a result of the continental rifting along the Red Sea, metalliferous sediments accumulate on the seafloor of the Atlantis II Deep. In the present study, a barite crust was identified in a sediment core from the Atlantis II Deep, indicating the formation of a hydrothermal mound at the sampling site. Here, we examined how such a dense barite crust could affect the local environment and the distribution of microbial inhabitants. Our results demonstrate distinctive features of mineral components and microbial communities in the sediment layers separated by the barite crust. Within the mound, archaea accounted for 65% of the community. In contrast, the sediments above the barite boundary were overwhelmed by bacteria. The composition of microbial communities under the mound was similar to that in the sediments of the nearby Discovery Deep and marine cold seeps. This work reveals the zonation of microbial communities after the formation of the hydrothermal mound in the subsurface sediments of the rift basin."

https://openalex.org/W2155723126,"Longitudinal studies have shown that brain white matter lesions are strong predictors of the conversion of unilateral optic neuritis to multiple sclerosis (MS) in Caucasian populations. Consequently brain MRI criteria have been developed to improve the prediction of the development of clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS). In Asian populations, optic neuritis may be the first sign of classical or optic-spinal MS. These signs add to the uncertainty regarding brain MRI changes with respect to the course of unilateral optic neuritis. The aim of this study was to examine the association between brain lesion activity and conversion to CDMS in Chinese patients with unilateral optic neuritis. A small prospective cohort study of 40 consecutive Chinese patients who presented with unilateral optic neuritis was conducted. Brain lesion activity was recorded as the incidence of Gd-enhanced lesions and new T2 lesions. Brain lesions on MRI that were characteristic of MS were defined according to the 2010 revisions of the McDonald criteria. The primary endpoint was the development of CDMS. We found that nineteen patients (48%) had brain lesions that were characteristic of MS on the initial scan. One of these patients (3%) had Gd-enhanced brain lesions. A significantly lower percentage of the patients (10%, p<0.001) presented with new T2 brain lesions on the second scan. During a median of 5 years of follow-up, seven patients (18%) developed CDMS. There was no significant difference in the conversion rate to CDMS between patients with and without brain lesions that were characteristic of MS (4/19 and 3/21, respectively; Fisher exact test, one-sided, p = 0.44). We conclude that brain lesions characteristic of MS are common in Chinese patients with unilateral optic neuritis; however, these patients exhibit low lesion activity. The predictive value of brain lesion activity for CDMS requires investigation in additional patients."
https://openalex.org/W1946736599,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small subset of cancer cells responsible for maintenance and progression of several types of cancer. Isolation, propagation, and the differentiation of CSCs in the proper stem niches expose the intrinsic difficulties for further studies. Here we show that induced cancer like stem cells (iCLSCs) can be generated by in vitro oncogenic manipulation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with well-defined oncogenic elements; SV40 LTg and HrasV12 by using a mouse stem virus long terminal repeat (MSCV-LTR)-based retroviral system. The reprogrammed mESCs using both oncogenes were characterized through their oncogenic gene expression, the enhancement of proliferation, and unhampered maintenance of stem properties in vitro and in vivo. In addition, these transformed cells resulted in the formation of malignant, immature ovarian teratomas in vivo. To successfully further expand these properties to other organs and species, more research needs to be done to fully understand the role of a tumor- favorable microenvironment. Our current study has provided a novel approach to generate induced cancer like stem cells through in vitro oncogenic reprogramming and successfully initiated organ-specific malignant tumor formation in an orthotopic small animal cancer model."
