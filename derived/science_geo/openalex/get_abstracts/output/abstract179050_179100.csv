This system provides high-speed, near-simultaneous acquisition of images of multiple fluorescent probes and of a brightfield channel. Vascular injury is induced with a laser focused through the microscope optics. We observed platelet deposition, tissue factor accumulation and fibrin generation after laser-induced endothelial injury in a single developing thrombus. The initiation of blood coagulation in vivo entailed the initial accumulation of tissue factor on the upstream and thrombus-vessel wall interface of the developing thrombus. Subsequently tissue factor was associated with the interior of the thrombus. Tissue factor was biologically active, and was associated with fibrin generation within the thrombus."

Inhibition of this activity by treating the cells with a MEK1-specific inhibitor (U0126 or PD98059) prior to the induction of differentiation significantly attenuated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α, perilipin, and adipocyte-specific fatty acid-binding protein (aP2). Treating the preadipocytes with troglitazone, a potent PPARγ ligand, could circumvent the inhibition of adipogenic gene expression by U0126. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), in the presence of dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine, and insulin, induces a prolonged activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which lasts for at least 12 h post-induction, and this activity is less sensitive to the MEK inhibitors. Consequently, preadipocytes treated with U0126 in the presence of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) express normal post-induction levels of MEK activity, and, in so doing, are capable of undergoing adipogenesis. We further show that activation of MEK1 significantly enhances the transactivation of the C/EBPα minimal promoter during the early phase of the differentiation process. Our results suggest that activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway during the initial 12 h of adipogenesis enhances the activity of factors that regulate both C/EBPα and PPARγ expression.

The differentiation of preadipocytes into mature insulin-responsive adipocytes involves exposure of a confluent, quiescent population of cells to a variety of effectors that activate a cascade of transcription factors commencing with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) 1The abbreviations used for: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; DEX, dexamethasone; MIX, isobutylmethylxanthine; FBS, fetal bovine serum; INS, insulin; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; aP2, adipocyte-specific fatty acid-binding protein; PKA, protein kinase A. 1The abbreviations used for: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; DEX, dexamethasone; MIX, isobutylmethylxanthine; FBS, fetal bovine serum; INS, insulin; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; aP2, adipocyte-specific fatty acid-binding protein; PKA, protein kinase A. β and C/EBPδ, which ultimately induce the expression of C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ (1Morrison R.F.

Terminal differentiation involves the coordinated regulation of several programs of gene expression by C/EBPα and PPARγ, which include the induction of proteins responsible for insulin sensitivity. Using the 3T3-L1 model of adipogenesis, several investigators have demonstrated a role for cAMP in activating C/EBPβ and for glucocorticoids in inducing C/EBPδ as well as PPARγ (3Cao Z. Umek R.M.

Insulin, acting through the IGF-1 receptor, is also required to ensure complete conversion of preadipocytes into adipocytes (6Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the precise role that it plays in the process is still unclear. The IGF-1 and insulin receptors are tyrosine kinases that can activate a series of signaling pathways in different cell types including the Ras-MAPK pathway. The p42 (ERK2) and p44 (ERK1) MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues by the dual specificity kinase MEK1, which induces their translocation into the nucleus where they activate or repress a variety of transcription factors involved in growth and differentiation (7Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have investigated the role of p42/p44 MAPK in regulating adipogenesis, but the conclusions are somewhat controversial. Some studies claim that activation of MAPK by various effectors blocks adipogenesis (8Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 9Shimba S. Wada T. Tezuka M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2809-2817PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kim S.W. Muise A.M. Lyons P.J. Ro H.S. J.

The distinguishing factor might involve the precise time of MAPK activation during the initial stages of the differentiation process. For instance, effectors that activate the MEK/ERK pathway at late stages of adipogenesis are likely to block adipogenic gene expression due to a MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of PPARγ (15Hu E.

Activation of the pathway early during adipogenesis prior to PPARγ expression might, on the other hand, promote differentiation by activating transcription factors operating to initiate PPARγ and C/EBPα expression. The goal of these studies was to determine whether the MEK/ERK signaling pathway regulates expression and/or activity of the adipogenic transcription factors during the early phase of adipogenesis. The results demonstrate that exposure of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to dexamethasone (DEX), isobutylmethylxanthine (MIX), insulin (INS), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) induces a robust, transient activation of the MEK/ERK pathway during the initial 1–2 h post-induction and that this activity is required for subsequent differentiation. Insulin, together with elevated cAMP levels (MIX treatment), appears to be the principal regulator of MEK activity, and promotes differentiation by enhancing the expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ. Furthermore, FGF-2 is also capable of stimulating adipogenesis under conditions where MEK activity is limiting. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum) until confluent and were then maintained in the same medium for an additional 2–3 days (5Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R.

Invest. 1998; 101: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Differentiation was induced at 2–3 days post-confluence by addition of 1 μm DEX, 0.5 mm MIX, 1.67 μm INS, and 10% FBS for 48 h, at which time the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.41 μm insulin and 10% FBS (22Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17088-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). For experiments performed with U0126 or PD98059, post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were preincubated for 30 min or one hour, respectively, prior to induction of differentiation. The C/EBPα minimal promoter/CAT reporter plasmid corresponding to −270 to +133 bp of the 5′ upstream region of the C/EBPα gene was generated as described previously (23Rana B. Xie Y. Mischoulon D. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18123-18132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A stable 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line was established by transfecting the C/EBPα/CAT vector along with a plasmid containing a neomycin gene to facilitate selection with G418. A single colony of G418-resistant preadipocytes (#4–2 cells) was selected for expression of the reporter gene and ability to undergo differentiation in response to DEX, MIX, and insulin. Post-confluent #4–2 cells exposed to different combinations of DEX, MIX, insulin, and FBS were harvested at different times and lysed by freeze-thawing. CAT assays were performed in triplicate on the cell lysates as described previously (23Rana B. Xie Y. Mischoulon D. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18123-18132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and CAT activity was expressed relative to equivalent amounts of protein in the assay. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in Western lysis buffer (300 μl/60 mm plate or 500 μl/100 mm plate) consisting of the following: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 30 mm NaPPi, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, leupeptin, and aprotonin. Samples were incubated on ice with frequent vortexing for 15 min and centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Protein content of each supernatant was quantified using a BCA kit (Pierce). Eighty micrograms of each supernatant sample of proteins was separated by electrophoresis through a 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to 0.45 μm Immobilin-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Following transfer, membranes were blocked with milk and probed with the following primary antibodies: activated ERK1/ERK2 (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA.); C/EBPα C/EBPβ, and PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA.); aP2/aFABP (gift of Dr. D. Bernlohr, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN); perilipin (gift of Dr. A. Greenberg, Tufts University, Boston, MA). Specific proteins were identified by further incubation of corresponding membranes with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) followed by treatment with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) according to manufacturers instructions. To understand the signaling events regulating the expression of the adipogenic transcription factors during the early phase of adipogenesis, we focused on the MEK/ERK pathway. To determine the precise time of activation of MEK1 activity during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, confluent cells were exposed to DEX, MIX, insulin, and FBS. Fig. 1 Ademonstrates that these effectors induce a rapid (within 5 min) but short-lived activation of MEK1, as indicated by its ability to phosphorylate ERK1 and ERK2, which subsides to quiescent levels by 6 h post-stimulation; interestingly, there is a second burst of activity at 12 h. The immediate early activation of this signaling pathway is followed by progression of the cells through the G1 phase of the cell cycle (data not shown) and subsequent differentiation as indicated by the induction of C/EBPβ at 1–2 h. By 2 days post-induction, the cells have switched from growth to terminal differentiation as revealed by an increase in PPARγ, C/EBPα, and perilipin expression. The data in Fig. 1 A demonstrate that the adipogenic hormones, acting as both mitogens and inducers of terminal differentiation, stimulate a rapid, transient activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Because adipogenesis is induced by exposure of confluent preadipocytes to a combination of hormones, it was important to determine which of the effectors contributes to the activation of MEK1. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1 B, total protein was harvested 10 min following treatment of cells with the indicated effectors in the presence of FBS and was subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-activated ERK antibody. Lane 3 of this figure demonstrates that elevation of cAMP levels by MIX (i.e. activation of PKA) is a principal mediator of ERK2 activation, and pretreatment of the cells with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 attenuates the effect of MIX (lane 4). Insulin was a weak activator of ERK2 (lane 5) but was unable to activate ERK1; nevertheless, it did potentiate the phosphorylation of both of these kinases by MIX in the presence or absence of DEX (comparelanes 11 and 13 with lanes 3 and7). Furthermore, this process was sensitive to treatment of the cells with PD98059 (lanes 12 and 14), suggesting that insulin and cAMP converge on pathways upstream of MEK1. Stimulation of the cells with FGF-2 in the presence of insulin, MIX, and DEX resulted in an even greater burst of MEK1 activity (lane 15), which was only slightly sensitive to PD98059 (lane 16). Several studies have demonstrated that insulin and/or insulin-like growth factor 1 functions as an inducer of adipogenesis in mouse preadipocytes (6Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Klemm D.J. Leitner J.W. Watson P. Nesterova A. Reusch J.E. Goalstone M.L. Draznin B. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In fact, the data in Fig. 1 B demonstrate that insulin in the presence of MIX also induces MEK1 activity (lane 11). Consequently, we questioned whether there is a relationship between these effects of insulin on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Fig. 2shows an insulin dose-dependent increase in C/EBPα, PPARγ, and perilipin gene expression on day 5 of differentiation, which is preceded by a corresponding insulin dose-dependent stimulation of MEK1 activity at 10 min post-induction. It is important to mention, however, that maximal ERK1/2 stimulation occurs at a higher dose of insulin (>664 nm) than that required for the stimulation of C/EBPα (especially the 42 kDa form) and PPARγ, which occurs around 44 nm. Furthermore, exposure of the cells to the MEK inhibitor U0126 completely blocks the ability of MEK1 to phosphorylate ERK1 and ERK2 and also attenuates the expression of C/EBPα, PPARγ, and perilipin expression. To determine the optimum dose of U0126 required to inhibit both MEK1 activity and adipogenesis, confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were exposed to increasing concentrations of the drug for 30 min prior to treatment with DEX, MIX, insulin, and FBS. The corresponding dose of U0126 was maintained in the culture medium during the initial 24 h of differentiation, and cells were harvested at either 15 min (MEK1 activity) or 5 days (adipogenic gene expression) post-induction. The Western blot presented in Fig. 3demonstrates a U0126 dose-dependent inhibition of MEK activity and a corresponding dose-dependent attenuation of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and aP2 expression. Inhibition of MEK1 activity by U0126 had no significant effect on the expression of C/EBPβ, suggesting that the MEK/ERK pathway is regulating adipogenesis downstream of C/EBPβ expression. A previous study (27Qiu Z. Wei Y. Chen N. Jiang M. Wu J. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) showed that attenuation of MEK1 activity with PD98059 blocked clonal expansion during the early phase of adipogenesis. We also observed that treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with the more potent MEK1 inhibitor U0126 had the same effect based on its ability to block the translocation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen into the nucleus at 24 h post-induction (data not shown). Because earlier investigations had suggested that clonal expansion is a prerequisite for adipogenesis (28Scott R.E. Florine D.L. Wille J.J.J. Yun K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 29Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17653-17660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we questioned whether preadipocytes treated with growth-inhibitory doses of U0126 (10 μm) could be induced to differentiate into adipocytes. To address this question, preadipocytes were treated with U0126 in the presence or absence of a potent PPARγ ligand troglitazone. Fig.4 also demonstrates that treatment of the cells with the MEK1 inhibitor for increasing periods of time attenuates PPARγ, C/EBPα, and aP2 expression without significantly affecting C/EBPβ. In fact, an exposure time of 24 h is as effective at inhibiting adipogenesis as exposure times up to 120 h. These data are consistent with the notion that the MEK/ERK pathway is acting to regulate adipogenesis during the first few hours following hormonal induction (Fig. 1 A). More importantly, Fig. 4 demonstrates that treatment of preadipocytes with troglitazone can rescue the U0126-associated block in adipogenic gene expression at all three exposure times in a manner that does not involve reactivation of clonal expansion by the PPARγ ligand (data not shown). These data suggest that adipogenesis can be induced in preadipocytes that are prevented from undergoing clonal expansion due to the presence of U0126. Furthermore, blocking MEK1 activity does not have any significant deleterious effect on the preadipocytes because they respond to troglitazone by inducing the normal level of C/EBPα and aP2 expression (Fig. 4, compare lanes 4, 8, and12 with lanes 1, 5, and9). Our previous studies (30Milasincic D.J. Calera M.R. Farmer S.R. Pilch P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) in myogenic cells suggested that FGF-2 was a significantly more potent activator of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway than insulin or IGF-1. To investigate the role of FGF-2 in regulating MEK1 activity during adipogenesis, confluent preadipocytes were exposed to DEX, MIX, and insulin in the presence or absence of FGF-2 and/or PD98059. Fig. 5 A demonstrates that FGF-2 induces a prolonged (>12 h) stimulation of MEK1 activity compared with the relatively short-lived (<2 h) activation in its absence (compare lane 19 with lane 9). Furthermore, it required several hours of exposure to the MEK inhibitor PD98059 to completely block the FGF-2-associated phosphorylation of ERK1/2. In fact, FGF-2 was capable of inducing a significant level of MEK1 activity in the presence of PD98059 during the initial 4–8 h post-induction. In light of this observation, we questioned whether FGF-2 might be capable of attenuating the inhibitory effect of U0126 on adipogenic gene expression by stimulating MEK1 activity. The experiment presented in Fig. 5 B shows that exposure of preadipocytes to FGF-2 together with DEX, MIX, and insulin results in a significantly greater activation of MEK1 at 15 min post-induction than treatment with the adipogenic inducers alone (Fig. 5 B, compare lane 5 with lane 3). The intense activation of MEK1 in the presence of FGF-2 could not be completely abrogated by the MEK1 inhibitor U0126; instead, it was attenuated to levels equivalent to those measured in the absence of FGF-2 (Fig. 5 B, comparelane 6 with lane 3). Furthermore, this residual level of MEK1 activity was enough to facilitate the induction of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and perilipin expression in cells that were also exposed to U0126 (Fig. 5 B, compare lane 6 withlane 4). It is important to mention that the preadipocytes were only exposed to FGF-2 for the initial 6 h of differentiation to activate MEK activity during this critical period. Prolonged exposure of cells to FGF-2 for times greater than 12–24 h inhibits adipogenesis by mechanisms that may also involve activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. To confirm the result shown in Fig. 5 B and to determine the dose of FGF-2 required to induce adipogenesis under conditions where MEK1 activity is limiting, preadipocytes were stimulated to differentiate in the presence of an inhibitory dose of U0126 with increasing doses of FGF-2 for 6 h. The cells were then maintained in culture for 5 days. As observed previously, the level of MEK1 activity at 10 min post-induction in the presence of U0126 is very low (Fig. 5 C, lane 3). Exposure of the preadipocytes to FGF-2 in the presence of U0126, however, restores this activity to normal post-induction levels and in so doing induces PPARγ, C/EBPα, and perilipin gene in an FGF-2 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 C, lanes 3–9). It appears that inhibition of MEK1 activity by either U0126 or PD98059 (data not shown) significantly blocks adipogenic gene expression without affecting the induction of C/EBPβ expression during the early phase of preadipocyte differentiation. Studies by others and us (4Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 5Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated a role for C/EBPβ in initiating a cascade of transcriptional events that regulate terminal differentiation. We questioned, therefore, whether the MEK/ERK pathway potentiates the activity of C/EBPβ in inducing C/EBPα gene transcription. To address this question, we generated a stable 3T3-L1 cell line expressing a C/EBPα minimal promoter-CAT reporter gene (referred to as L1#4–2 cells). This minimal promoter corresponds to a fragment of genomic DNA consisting of −272 to +133 bp relative to the transcription start site of the C/EBPα gene. Previous studies have identified a C/EBP regulatory element at −170 to −195 and have also demonstrated that transcription from this minimal promoter requires C/EBPβ (23Rana B. Xie Y. Mischoulon D. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18123-18132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The analyses presented in Fig.6 demonstrate that expression of this reporter gene responds positively to effectors that enhance C/EBPβ in the L1#4–2 cells. Specifically, exposure of the cells to MIX and insulin or DEX, MIX, and insulin for different times over a 72 h period resulted in a peak of CAT activity at 36–60 h (Fig.6 A) with a corresponding increase in C/EBPβ expression (Fig. 6 B). Exposure to FBS with or without insulin caused a negligible increase in CAT activity and C/EBPβ expression. The observation that the activity of the C/EBPα/CAT reporter gene is transient suggests that additional regulatory elements not found in the minimal promoter are required to maintain activity throughout the entire differentiation process. As predicted from the data in Fig. 5, FGF-2 significantly enhances C/EBPα promoter/reporter gene activity in 3T3-L1#4–2 cells following their exposure to MIX and insulin (Fig.6 C). Furthermore, treatment of the cells with PD98059 significantly attenuated the induction of the reporter gene by MIX and insulin in the presence or absence of FGF-2. After several years of investigation it is becoming apparent that the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature fat cells is a complex process involving the interplay of many effectors both positive and negative that regulate a network of signaling pathways, which eventually converge on the adipogenic gene program. Some of the pathways operate to “fine tune” the functions of the mature adipocyte in response to changes in the overall physiologic status of the organism. For instance, insulin and β-adrenergic receptor activity antagonize each other to regulate lipolysis in response to the energy needs of the body. Some signaling events, however, function to regulate the expression and activity of the many transcription factors that orchestrate the differentiation process. This investigation provides evidence for a role of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in regulating the expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ during adipogenesis. Specifically, exposure of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to a mixture of adipogenic hormones consisting of DEX, MIX, insulin, and FBS activates MEK1 during the initial 1–2 h post-induction as indicated by its ability to phosphorylate ERK1 and ERK2. Inhibition of this activity by exposure of preadipocytes to the MEK1 inhibitors U0126 or PD98059 significantly attenuates expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ without affecting C/EBPβ expression. Furthermore, FGF-2 can induce adipogenic gene expression in preadipocytes exposed to U0126 by promoting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. One mechanism by which the MEK/ERK pathway might activate C/EBPα expression is to enhance the ability of C/EBPβ to transactivate the C/EBPα gene promoter. Establishing a role for the MEK/ERK pathway in regulating adipogenesis has been difficult because many of the studies have arrived at completely opposite conclusions. For instance, several studies (15Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 16Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4900-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have shown that stimulating ERK activity in adipocytes by exposure to mitogens attenuates adipogenic gene expression by mechanisms that likely involve phosphorylation and inactivation of PPARγ. Some studies (9Shimba S. Wada T. Tezuka M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2809-2817PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that drugs or effectors that block adipogenesis are also potent inducers of ERK activity, and attenuation of this activity with the MEK inhibitors restores differentiation. Similarly, a recent study (31Hansen J.B. Petersen R.K. Jorgensen C. Kristiansen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26335-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) provides evidence for a positive role for the retinoblastoma protein in facilitating adipogenesis by suppressing ERK activity. In contrast, several investigations including the present study have shown that some pro-adipogenic agents stimulate MEK/ERK activity, and, in some cases, attenuation of this activity with MEK inhibitors blocks adipogenesis (12Bost F. Caron L. Marchetti I. Dani C. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Binetruy B. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 13Machinal-Quelin F. Dieudonne M.N. Leneveu M.C.

We suggest that stimulation of the MEK/ERK pathway can both promote and attenuate adipogenesis depending on its time of activation during the differentiation process. The data presented in Fig. 1 show that MEK activity is rapidly induced during the initial few hours following exposure of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to insulin, MIX, and DEX. The peak of activity eventually subsides to pre-induction levels by 4–6 h, but there is a second reproducible burst of activity detected at 12 h. In addition, exposure of preadipocytes to FGF-2 induces an even greater induction of MEK activity, which is also confined to the initial 12 h of the differentiation process. In both cases, this time-restricted burst of MEK activity promotes differentiation by facilitating the expression of the principal adipogenic transcription factors, PPARγ and C/EBPα. It appears that activation of MEK1 at times following the induction of these factors will inhibit adipogenesis by attenuating their transcriptional activity. The mechanisms that regulate the extent and duration of ERK activity might, therefore, play an important role in regulating adipogenic gene expression. The MAPK phosphatases (MKP-1 and MKP-2) that dephosphorylate and inactivate ERK1 and ERK2 are potential candidates for regulating ERK activity during adipogenesis. In fact, MKP-1 and MKP-2 are immediate early genes that are induced when quiescent cells are exposed to a variety of extracellular signals including mitogens (33Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 34Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It is conceivable, therefore, that insulin induces MKP-1/2 very rapidly during the early phase of adipogenesis so that ERK activity is confined to a limited but precise period of the differentiation process. In the case of FGF-2, induction of MKP-1 may be significantly delayed or attenuated, therefore, facilitating prolongation of ERK activity as observed in Fig. 5 A. What are the potential roles of the activated forms of ERK1 and ERK2 in promoting adipogenesis? Studies by others and us (4Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 5Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) have demonstrated a role for C/EBPβ, with or without C/EBPδ, in initiating a cascade of transcriptional events that lead to expression of the many hundreds of proteins responsible for the mature fat cell phenotype. Consequently, factors that influence the ability of C/EBPβ to initiate this cascade of gene expression are possible targets of ERK1/2. In fact, the ERKs might phosphorylate C/EBPβ during the early phase of adipogenesis and enhance its ability to activate C/EBPα transcription. Consistent with this notion are studies in other systems demonstrating that MAPKs can enhance the transactivation properties of C/EBPβ via the phosphorylation of Thr-235 (35Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 36Kowenz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Induction of adipogenesis also involves suppression of a host of negative effectors that act to maintain the preadipocyte in an undifferentiated state. It is conceivable, therefore, that the MEK/ERK pathway also operates to suppress the activity of these negative factors. In this regard, Lane and coworkers (37Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Lane M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4855-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 38Jiang M.S. Tang Q.Q. McLenithan J. Geiman D. Shillinglaw W. Henzel W.J. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3467-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the Sp1 and AP-2 families of transcription factors repress C/EBPα transcription by blocking association of the C/EBPs with the C/EBP regulatory element within the promoter of the C/EBPα gene. The abundance of Sp1 and AP-2α decreases during 3T3-L1 differentiation; therefore, it is possible that the MEK/ERK pathway facilitates their down-regulation. In fact, these authors show that exposure of growth-arrested 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to agents that increase cAMP levels induces a rapid (within 2 to 4 h) and transient decrease in Sp1. They also show that the phosphorylated form of Sp1 decays more abruptly than the unphosphorylated form. Other studies (39Merchant J.L. Du M. Todisco A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 40Chupreta S. Du M. Todisco A. Merchant J.L. Am. J. Physiol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20631-20639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) have shown that the activity of Sp1 is regulated by the ERK signaling pathway, which involves an ERK-associated phosphorylation of the transcription factor at a MAPK consensus site. It is possible, therefore, that elevation of cAMP in response to MIX along with insulin induces an ERK-associated modification of Sp1, which initiates its degradation, thus relieving repression on the C/EBPα promoter. This model of ERK regulation of C/EBPα promoter activity would also be consistent with the data presented in Fig. 6 because the 5′ region of the C/EBPα/CAT reporter gene contains the Sp1 elements previously shown by Lane and coworkers (37Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Lane M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4855-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 38Jiang M.S. Tang Q.Q. McLenithan J. Geiman D. Shillinglaw W. Henzel W.J. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3467-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) to repress C/EBPα transcription. In a similar manner, the MEK/ERK pathway could be suppressing other known repressors of adipogenesis. Most notable among these negative effectors is Wnt-10b, which is secreted from preadipocytes and acts in an autocrine fashion to stimulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Activation of this pathway by Wnt-10b inhibits GSK3β activity, which leads to the translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus where it co-activates TCF/LEF transcription factors and, in so doing, inhibits expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ (42Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Recent studies by MacDougald and coworkers (43Bennett C.N. Ross S.E. Longo K.A. Bajnok L. Hemati N. Johnson K.W. Harrison S.D. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30998-31004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) demonstrate that various components of the Wnt signaling pathway including Wnt-10b and the frizzled receptors (Fz1, 2, and 5) are down-regulated during the initial 1–2 days of differentiation. Furthermore, suppression of Wnt-10b production appears to be mediated by a cAMP-associated inhibition of Wnt-10b mRNA expression. It is possible that the MEK/ERK signaling pathway is also involved in this process. In conclusion, we suggest that the MEK/ERK signaling pathway can affect adipogenesis in different ways depending on its precise time of activation during the differentiation process. Future studies aimed at identifying the targets of the pathway should provide greater insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα during the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2011985298,"Primary pulmonary hypertension is a progressive and often fatal disorder in humans that results from an increase in pulmonary blood pressure associated with abnormal vascular proliferation. Dexfenfluramine increases the risk of pulmonary hypertension in humans, and its active metabolite is a selective serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2B (5-HT(2B)) receptor agonist. Thus, we investigated the contribution of the 5-HT(2B)receptor to the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. Using the chronic-hypoxic-mouse model of pulmonary hypertension, we found that the hypoxia-dependent increase in pulmonary blood pressure and lung remodeling are associated with an increase in vascular proliferation, elastase activity and transforming growth factor-beta levels, and that these parameters are potentiated by dexfenfluramine treatment. In contrast, hypoxic mice with genetically or pharmacologically inactive 5-HT(2B)receptors manifested no change in any of these parameters. In both humans and mice, pulmonary hypertension is associated with a substantial increase in 5-HT(2B) receptor expression in pulmonary arteries. These data show that activation of 5-HT(2B) receptors is a limiting step in the development of pulmonary hypertension."

In this study, we found that all four of the fas-1 domains in βig-h3 mediate MRC-5 fibroblast adhesion and that this was specifically inhibited by a function-blocking monoclonal antibody specific for the αvβ5 integrin. Using deletion mutants of the fourth fas-1 domain revealed the MRC-5 cell adhesion motif (denoted the YH motif) is located in amino acids 548–614. Experiments with substitution mutants showed that tyrosine 571, histidine 572, and their flanking leucine and isoleucine amino acids, which are all highly conserved in many fas-1 domains, are essential for mediating MRC-5 cell adhesion. A synthetic 18-amino acid peptide encompassing these conserved amino acids could effectively block MRC-5 cell adhesion to βig-h3. Using HEK293 cells stably transfected with the β5 integrin cDNA, we confirmed that the αvβ5 integrin is a functional receptor for the YH motif.

The gene encoding βig-h3 was first identified by Skonier et al. (1Skonier J. Neubauer M. Madisen L. Bennett K. Plowman G.D. Purchio A.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), who isolated it by screening a cDNA library made from a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) that had been treated with TGF-β. The βig-h3 protein comprises 683 amino acids containing four homologous internal repeat domains. These domains are homologous to similar motifs in the Drosophila protein fasciclin-I and thus are denoted fas-1 domains. The fas-1 domain has highly conserved sequences found in secretory and membrane proteins of several species, including mammals, insects, sea urchins, plants, yeast, and bacteria (2Kawamoto T.

We reported previously that βig-h3 mediates corneal epithelial cell adhesion by binding to α3β1 integrin. Two motifs interacting with the α3β1 integrin were located within the second and the fourth fas-1 domains of βig-h3. Interestingly, however, we found that these two motifs are not involved in βig-h3-mediated fibroblastic cell adhesion. Furthermore, all four fas-1 domains of βig-h3 mediate fibroblastic cell adhesion, whereas corneal epithelial cell adhesion is supported by just the second and the fourth fas-1 domains. This suggests that βig-h3 has additional motifs that can mediate the adhesion of other cell types. Confirming this, we show in the present study that βig-h3 has a motif that promotes fibroblastic cell adhesion by interacting with the αvβ5 integrin on the fibroblast cell surface. This motif is well conserved in many fas-1 domains found in various proteins from different species. Together with our previous findings, these observations suggest that βig-h3 mediates cell functions through multiple cell-adhesion motifs that interact with different integrins on various cell types. This also suggests that other fas-I-containing proteins could regulate cell functions by interacting with integrins. Bacterial expression vectors for the wild-type βig-h3 and each fas-1 domain have been described previously (10Kim J.-E. Kim S.-J. Lee B.-H. Park R.-W. Kim K.-S. Kim I.-S. J. Biol.

These fragments were cloned into theEcoRV/XhoI sites of the pET-29b(+) vector (Novagen) and were denoted as ΔH1, ΔH2, ΔH2 (6Kim J.-E. Kim E.-H. Han E.-H. Park R.-W. Park I.-H. Jun S.-H. Kim J.-C.

Recombinant βig-h3 proteins were induced and purified as described previously (6Kim J.-E. Kim E.-H. Han E.-H. Park R.-W. Park I.-H. Jun S.-H. Kim J.-C. Young M.F. Kim I.-S. J. Cell.

MRC-5 (human lung fibroblast) cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably transfected with an empty vector (pcDNA3) or a human integrin β5 expression vector were donated by Dr. Jeffrey Smith (Burnham Institute, San Diego, CA). These stable cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The cell adhesion assay was performed as described previously (11Kim I.-S. Sinha S. deCrombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4003-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, flat-bottomed 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates (Costar Corning Inc., New York) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml recombinant βig-h3 proteins or other extracellular matrix proteins and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cells were suspended in medium at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml, and 0.1 ml of the cell suspension was added to each well of the coated plates. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, unattached cells were removed by rinsing once with PBS. Attached cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 3.75 mm p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glycosaminide and 0.25% Triton X-100. Enzyme activity was blocked by adding 50 mm glycine buffer, pH 10.4, containing 5 mmEDTA, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm in a Bio-Rad model 550 microplate reader. Synthetic peptides purchased from AnyGen Co. Ltd. (Kwangju, Korea) were tested for their ability to inhibit cells from adhering to the protein substrates coating the wells. The cell-adhesion assay was performed in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of each peptide. To identify the receptor for βig-h3, monoclonal antibodies to different types of integrins (Chemicon, International Inc. Temecula, CA) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min with MRC-5 in 0.1 ml of incubation solution (3 × 105 cells/ml). The cells were then transferred onto plates precoated with recombinant βig-h3 proteins and incubated further for 30 min at 37 °C. The attached cells were then quantified as described above. Function-blocking monoclonal antibodies to the following to integrin subunits were used: α1, FB12; α2, P1E6; α3, P1B5; α4, P1H4; α5, P1D6; α6, GoH3; αv, P3G8; β1, 6S6; β2, P4H9; αvβ3, LM609; and αvβ5, P1F6. Confluent cells were detached from the plates by treatment with 0.25% trypsin/0.05% EDTA. After being washed twice in PBS, the cells were suspended in PBS and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibodies. Antibodies specific for α1 (FB12), α3 (ASC-1), α4 (P1H4), α5β1 (HA5), α6 (CLB701), αv (P3G8), αvβ3 (LM609), αvβ5 (P1F6), and β1 (12G10) were purchased from Chemicon. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml of the secondary antibody, goat-anti-mouse IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and analyzed at 488 nm on the flow cytometer FACScalibur system (BD Biosciences) equipped with a 5-watt argon laser. In our previous report (10Kim J.-E. Kim S.-J. Lee B.-H. Park R.-W. Kim K.-S. Kim I.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30907-30915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the second and the fourth fas-1 domains but not the first and/or the third domains mediate corneal epithelial cell adhesion. In contrast, in this study, we found that MRC-5 fibroblasts adhere equally well to each of the four fas-1 domains (Fig.1 A). This suggests that each fas-1 domain has a motif for MRC-5 cell adhesion. Furthermore, the MRC-5-bininding motifs in the second and the fourth fas-1 domains may not be the NKDIL and EPDIM regions, respectively, that were found earlier to mediate corneal epithelial cell adhesion. Confirming this, we showed that the NKDIL and EPDIM peptides do not inhibit MRC-5 cell adhesion to any of the fas-1 domains or to the βig-h3-WT protein (Fig. 1 A). To identify the βig-h3 receptor on MRC-5 fibroblast cells, function-blocking monoclonal antibodies specific for various integrin subunits were examined for their ability to block the adhesion of MRC-5 cells to the βig-h3-WT protein or the fas-1 domains (Fig. 1, B and C). MRC-5 cell adhesion to the βig-h3-WT protein and all of the fas-1 domains was specifically inhibited by the antibody to the αvβ5 subunit but not by any of the other antibodies (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, βig-h3 has a motif in each fas-1 domain that interacts with the αvβ5 integrin. To confirm that MRC-5 cells express the αvβ5 integrin on their surface, we performed FACS analysis using monoclonal antibodies to several integrins (Fig. 1 D). Several integrins, including the αvβ5 integrin, were observed on the MRC-5 cell surface, but the αvβ3 integrin was not detected. To identify the αvβ5 integrin-interacting motif(s) in βig-h3, we made five N-terminal- and C-terminal-deleted recombinant proteins of the fourth fas-1 domain, which consists of amino acids 498–637. The proteins were denoted ΔH1, ΔH2, ΔH2 (6Kim J.-E. Kim E.-H. Han E.-H. Park R.-W. Park I.-H. Jun S.-H. Kim J.-C. Young M.F. Kim I.-S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), ΔH1H2, and ΔH1H2 (6Kim J.-E. Kim E.-H. Han E.-H. Park R.-W. Park I.-H. Jun S.-H. Kim J.-C. Young M.F. Kim I.-S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). ΔH1 and ΔH2 represent the fourth fas-1 domain lacking one of two conserved fas-1 regions known as H1 (amino acids 498–547) and H2 (amino acids 621–637). ΔH1H2 lacks both H1 and H2. ΔH2 (6Kim J.-E. Kim E.-H. Han E.-H. Park R.-W. Park I.-H. Jun S.-H. Kim J.-C. Young M.F. Kim I.-S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and ΔH1H2 (6Kim J.-E. Kim E.-H. Han E.-H. Park R.-W. Park I.-H. Jun S.-H. Kim J.-C. Young M.F. Kim I.-S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) are ΔH2 and ΔH1H2 that lack in addition the C-terminal amino acids containing the α3β1 integrin-interacting motif EPDIM. We tested the ability of each protein to promote MRC-5 cell adhesion (Fig. 2 A). All, including the smallest mutant protein, ΔH1H2 (6Kim J.-E. Kim E.-H. Han E.-H. Park R.-W. Park I.-H. Jun S.-H. Kim J.-C. Young M.F. Kim I.-S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), could mediate MRC-5 cell adhesion (Fig 2 A). Thus, H1 and H2 are not involved and the cell adhesion motif is present within amino acids 548–614. To further identify the cell-adhesion motif within this fragment, we performed a computer search using Prodom 2001.2 searching for homologies not only among the four βig-h3 domains but also among the fas-1 domains from other proteins. Interestingly, many fas-1 domains, including the four fas-1 domains of βig-h3, contain two amino acid residues, a tyrosine and a histidine, in the domain center (Fig.2 B). In the fourth domain of βig-h3, the tyrosine and the histidine are amino acids 571 and 572, respectively. We assessed whether the tyrosine and histidine are needed for MRC-5 cell adhesion, first by using the two deleted proteins βig-h3 D-IV-569 and βig-h3 D-IV-575. These proteins encode amino acids 569–632 and 575–632, respectively, and thus βig-h3 D-IV-575 lacks the tyrosine and histidine residues. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the mutant proteins were both significantly less able to mediate MRC-5 cell adhesion compared with the ΔH1, ΔH2, ΔH2 (6Kim J.-E. Kim E.-H. Han E.-H. Park R.-W. Park I.-H. Jun S.-H. Kim J.-C. Young M.F. Kim I.-S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), ΔH1H2, and ΔH1H2 (6Kim J.-E. Kim E.-H. Han E.-H. Park R.-W. Park I.-H. Jun S.-H. Kim J.-C. Young M.F. Kim I.-S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) proteins tested earlier (Fig. 2 A), suggesting the potential importance of residues 548–569. However, the ability of D-IV-575 to promote MRC-5 cell adhesion was less than that of βig-h3 D-IV-569. Thus, tyrosine 571 and histidine 572 may play an essential role in the cell-adhesion activity of βig-h3. To confirm this, we generated substitution mutant βig-h3 proteins whose tyrosine 571 and/or histidine 571 residues were replaced with alanine (Fig. 2 C). Unexpectedly, the single point mutations did not significantly affect cell-adhesion activity. However, the double point mutation significantly inhibited the cell adhesion activity of βig-h3, although not completely. Thus, tyrosine 571 and histidine 572 are clearly required in βig-h3-mediated MRC-5 cell adhesion. However, flanking amino acids may also be needed. To confirm that tyrosine 571 and histidine 572 are necessary for MRC-5 cell adhesion, a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 569–574 (YH6) was generated and used to compete cell adhesion to βig-h3. However, this peptide could not inhibit MRC-5 cell adhesion to βig-h3. We then used the larger YH10 peptide corresponding to amino acids 567–576 but it also could not inhibit cell adhesion. However, when we tested YH18, which corresponds to amino acids 563–580, MRC-5 cell adhesion to βig-h3 was almost completely abolished. The control peptide YH18-con, which contains the amino acids of YH18 but in a scrambled sequence, did not affect cell adhesion to βig-h3 (Fig.3 A). We obtained similar results when each of the four fas-1 domains was used as the substrate (Fig. 3 B). The competition of cell adhesion by the YH18 peptide was dose-dependent (Fig. 3 C). To confirm that the YH18-like sequences of the other three fas-1 domains of βig-h3 are also effective in competing MRC-5 cell adhesion to βig-h3, we synthesized three peptides representing these sequences. As shown in Fig. 3 D, these peptides also inhibited MRC-5 cell adhesion to βig-h3 in a dose-dependent manner. Whereas peptides from D-I, -II, and -III regions showed similar inhibitory activity, the peptide from the D-IV showed slightly higher activity compared with the others. Although all of these peptides were effective in the micromolar range (D-IV peptide inhibited 50% cell adhesion at 200 μm), they displayed far less activity compared with the recombinant domain IV protein which inhibited cell adhesion by 50% between 5 μm and 10 μm(Fig. 3 E). This suggests that, although a region of 18 amino acids comprises the basic element required for minimal activity, longer stretches are required for full activity. Taken together, these results suggest that the YH18-like sequences encompassing the conserved tyrosine and histidine residues are essential for MRC-5 cell adhesion, confirming that not only the tyrosine and histidine but also flanking amino acids are minimally required for βig-h3-mediated MRC-5 cell adhesion. Because the leucine and isoleucine residues that flank the tyrosine and histidine are also well conserved among the fas-1 domains from different proteins (Fig.4 A), we examined their role in βig-h3-mediated MRC-5 cell adhesion. We constructed a number of substitution mutants of βig-h3 whose tyrosine, histidine, leucine, and isoleucine residues were substituted in various combinations by serine (leucine and isoleucine) or alanine (tyrosine and histidine) (Fig. 4 B). These mutants were then used in cell adhesion assays. D-IV-L represents the fourth fas-1 domain whose leucine 565, isoleucine 568, and leucine 569 were replaced with serine. D-IV-R represents the fourth fas-1 domain whose isoleucine 573, isoleucine 577, and leucine 578 were replaced with serine. D-IV-LAA and D-IV-AAR represents D-IV-L and D-IV-R whose tyrosine 571 and histidine 572 were replaced with alanine. D-IV-LYHR represents the fourth fas-1 domain whose conserved amino acids mentioned above were replaced with serine or alanine. Although D-IV-L, D-IV-R, D-IV-LAA, D-IV-AAR, and D-IV-LYHR show less cell-adhesion activity compared with the fourth fas-1 domain, they still promote some cell adhesion (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the D-IV-LAAR mutant, where all conserved amino acids had been substituted, was very poor in mediating MRC-5 cell adhesion. Thus, multiple amino acids are required to form a conformation that mediates MRC-5 cell adhesion to βig-h3. To confirm that βig-h3 mediates cell adhesion through the αvβ5 integrin, we used stably transfected HEK293 cells (β5/293) that express human β5 integrin. HEK293 cells do not normally express the β5 integrin although they do express many β1 integrins, including α1β1, α3β1, α5β1, α6β1, and αvβ1 (12Bossy B. Reichardt L.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10191-10198Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We confirmed that β5/293 cells express the αvβ5 integrin by FACS analysis (data not shown). β5/293 cells strongly adhered to surfaces coated with βig-h3-WT or vitronectin, unlike pc/293 cells, which are HEK293 cells stably transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 5 A). β5/293 cell adhesion to βig-h3 was specifically inhibited by an antibody recognizing the αvβ5 integrin (Fig. 5 B) and by the YH18 peptide (Fig. 5 C). These results confirm that βig-h3 mediates cell adhesion by interacting with the αvβ5 integrin. We previously identified two α3β1 integrin-interacting motifs that are required for βig-h3-mediated adhesion of corneal epithelial cells (10Kim J.-E. Kim S.-J. Lee B.-H. Park R.-W. Kim K.-S. Kim I.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30907-30915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, these motifs are not involved in the βig-h3-mediated adhesion of mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, and osteoblasts. This observation led us to seek the motifs in βig-h3 that are involved in the βig-h3-mediated adhesion of fibroblasts. Here we report a new βig-h3 motif that interacts with the αvβ5 integrin and is necessary for the βig-h3-mediated adhesion of fibroblasts. Unlike corneal epithelial cells, MRC-5 fibroblasts adhere to all four fas-1 domains of βig-h3. Furthermore, this adhesion was not blocked by the presence of the α3β1 integrin-interacting peptides EPDIM and NKDIL. Thus, MRC-5 cells must adhere to βig-h3 through an integrin other than the α3β1 integrin. We used several function-blocking integrin-specific antibodies and found that only anti-αvβ5 integrin antibody could eliminate MRC-5 cell adhesion to βig-h3 and the fas-1 domains. We confirmed that MRC-5 cells express the αvβ5 integrin on their cell surface. Ohno et al. (9Ohno S. Noshiro M. Makihira S. Kawamoto T. Shen M. Yan W. Kawashim-Ohya Y. Fujimoto K. Tanne K. Kato Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) previously reported that βig-h3 mediates MRC-5 fibroblast cell adhesion through the α1β1 integrin. However, we consistently found that α1 and β1 integrin-function blocking antibodies did not significantly block MRC-5 cell adhesion to βig-h3. We confirmed that α1 and β1 integrin function-blocking antibodies used effectively inhibited the adhesion of several cell lines to specific ligands including collagen and fibronectin (data not shown). Thus, it is very unlikely that this discrepancy is due to using different antibodies. Unfortunately, they did not test whether αvβ5 function-blocking antibody could inhibit MRC-5 cell adhesion to βig-h3. Thus, we are as yet unable to explain the discrepancy clearly. Interestingly, even though MRC-5 cells and corneal epithelial cells (10Kim J.-E. Kim S.-J. Lee B.-H. Park R.-W. Kim K.-S. Kim I.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30907-30915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) express both the α3β1 and αvβ5 integrins, the two cell lines use only one but not the same integrin type for adhesion to βig-h3 (this report and Ref. 10Kim J.-E.

The choice of the integrin used may depend on the activation state of the integrins in each cell line. There are a variety of intracellular cues that cause cells to modulate the affinity and avidity of their integrins for their extracellular matrix ligands. For example, R-Ras and H-Ras are known to regulate cell adhesion by modulating the affinity of multiple integrins for the extracellular matrix (13Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 14Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of integrins alters the conformation of the integrins and thereby changes their affinity for their ligands (15Datta A. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3943-3949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We are currently engaged in investigating why MRC-5 and corneal epithelial cells use different integrin types to interact with βig-h3. The finding that the anti-αvβ5 integrin antibody blocks the ability of all the fas-1 domains in βig-h3 to mediate MRC-5 cell adhesion suggests that each domain has a motif that interacts with the αvβ5 integrin. We investigated this issue by constructing a series of deletion mutants of the fourth fas-1 domain and assessing their ability to promote MRC-5 cell adhesion. Two regions denoted H1 and H2 are highly conserved in each of the fas-1 domains, but deletion of either or both of these regions did not affect cell adhesion. Because all four fas-1 domains mediate cell adhesion through the same integrin type, it is likely that they all carry the same conserved consensus sequence that facilitates this interaction. We performed sequence analysis of the fas-1 domains of βig-h3 and other fas-1-containing proteins and found a tyrosine, a histidine, and many leucine/isoleucine residues flanking the tyrosine and histidine, which are highly conserved. Experiments with deletion and substitution mutants revealed that a motif containing these amino acid residues is essential for the ability of βig-h3 to mediate MRC-5 cell adhesion, indicating they are part of the αvβ5 integrin-binding motif in βig-h3. Unlike the α3β1 integrin-interacting motifs NKDIL and EPDIM in βig-h3, the cell-adhesion activity of this new motif does not depend on a few crucial amino acid residues because single point mutations of tyrosine and histidine did not significantly affect the cell adhesion activity of βig-h3. Even substitution mutations of several of the conserved tyrosine, histidine, leucine, and isoleucine residues could not completely abolish the cell adhesion activity. Only the massive mutation of all these conserved amino acids almost completely abrogated the cell adhesion activity of βig-h3. This is supported by competition studies using synthetic peptides that showed that six- and ten-amino acid peptides containing the tyrosine and histidine residues could not compete cell adhesion, unlike the much larger 18-amino acid peptide YH18. Furthermore, although a peptide of 18 amino acids had activity, it was much less active compared with the recombinant domain IV protein, suggesting that the region of 18 amino acids only comprises the minimal element required for the cell adhesion activity of the fas-1 domain. Amino acids flanking this minimally conserved region could possibly contribute to the conformation of the αvβ5 integrin-binding site, thereby enhancing its activity. It is, however, very hard to predict which amino acids are critical because we could not find any conserved amino acids other than tyrosine, histidine, and leucine/isoleucine among several fas-1 domains although the computer analysis showed a few weakly conserved alipathic or hydrophobic amino acids were present around the conserved tyrosine and histidine residues. Thus, although the 18-amino acid region comprising the conserved histidine, tyrosine, and leucine/isoleucine residues contains the basic requirements for cell adhesion, a more extensive region is required for full potentiation of this activity. The αvβ5 integrin is thought to bind to a number of extracellular matrix proteins, including vitronectin and osteopontin (16Smith J.W. Vestal D.J. Irwin S.V. Burke T.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11008-11013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hu D.D. Lin E.C. Kovach N.L. Hoyer J.R. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26232-26238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Binding to these ligands appears to be RGD-dependent because peptides containing this tripeptide motif inhibit αvβ5 integrin binding. Although the sequence of the αvβ5 integrin-binding motif contained in YH18 differs from the RGD motif, both peptides may recognize the same site in the αvβ5 integrin because MRC-5 cell adhesion to βig-h3 is inhibited by the RGD peptide (data not shown). Furthermore, MRC-5 cell adhesion to vitronectin is also inhibited by the YH18 peptide (data not shown). Alternatively, the binding of one αvβ5 integrin site may alter the conformation of the other site, thereby inhibiting the interaction. Because the αvβ3 integrin also interacts with vitronectin and osteopontin in a RGD-dependent manner (18Bayless K.J. Salazar R. Davis G.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1673-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 19Hu D.D. Hoyer J.R. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9917-9925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it is possible that the YH18 peptide could also bind to the αvβ3 integrin. We could not test this notion in the study reported here because MRC-5 cells do not express the αvβ3 integrin. However, it is possible that βig-h3 could interact with the αvβ3 integrin through the YH motif because we have found that adhesion to βig-h3 of some cell types depends both on the YH motif and the αvβ3 integrin (data not shown). In this regard, it is noteworthy that βig-h3 is expressed by endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (20O'Brien E.R. Bennett K.L. Garvin M.R. Zdric T.W. Hinohara T. Simpson J.B. Kimura T.

Ozawa H. Toyama Y. Bonewald L.F. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) are secretory proteins with four fas-1 domains, and stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 are membrane proteins with seven fas-1 domains (24Politz O. Gratchev A. McCourt P.A. Schledzewski K. Guillot P. Johansson S. Svineng G. Franke P. Kannicht C. Kzhyshkowska J. Longati P. Velten F.W. Johansson S. Goerdt S. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although the biological functions of these proteins are not comprehensively understood, it is possible that all may function in regulating cell-matrix interactions and cell-cell interactions, because all of the fas-1 domains bear potential integrin-interacting YH motifs. These four human proteins are unique among the integrin-interacting proteins in that they bear multiple repeat integrin-interacting motifs. None of the other molecules known to interact with integrins has multiple repeats of motifs that interact with one integrin type. It is of interest to determine the biological meaning of this unique feature of the human fas-1 domain-bearing proteins. In conclusion, we have identified a new cell-adhesion motif that interacts with the αvβ5 integrin. This motif is present in each of the fas-1 repeat domains of βig-h3 and consists of tyrosine and histidine flanked by several leucine/isoleucine residues. The fact that this motif is well conserved in most of the fas-1 domains present in many disparate proteins suggests that fas-1 domain-containing proteins may regulate various cell functions by interacting with integrins.

It is encoded by the diabetes (db) gene, mutation of which also results in phenotypes similar to that exhibited byob/ob mice. OB-R is alternatively spliced into at least five transcripts from a single gene. These transcripts encode proteins that are called the long (OB-Rb), short (OB-Ra, -c, and -d), and soluble (OB-Re) forms of the leptin receptor. With the exception of the soluble leptin receptor, other receptor isoforms differ from each other by the alternative use of a unique terminal coding exon (6Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M.

OB-Rb is enriched in the hypothalamus, the site of leptin's action on food intake and body weight.

These neural circuits represent the main known downstream mediators of leptin's biological effect on food intake. OB-Rb can also activate signal transduction in a variety of peripheral tissues, including adipose tissue, T cells, endothelial cells, and pancreatic β-cells (11Kim Y.B. Uotani S. Pierroz D.D.

More recently, it is also demonstrated that leptin-induced fatty acid oxidation in muscle via 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase is mediated by both leptin acting on muscle directly and by functioning through the hypothalamic-sympathetic nervous system axis (16Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results confirm that direct as well as indirect leptin signaling at these sites may be necessary for the many biological effects of leptin. In all cases, the presence of OB-Rb is required, asdb/db mice that are without this receptor isoform do not respond to leptin.Although OB-Rb is essential in mediating leptin's biological effects, other receptor isoforms may still be necessary for leptin to exert its full spectrum of in vivo functions. Among the short forms of the leptin receptor, OB-Ra is most abundantly expressed (17Fei H. Okano H.J. Li C. Lee G.-H. Zhao C. Darnell R. Friedman J.M. Prod. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7001-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). It is enriched at the choroid plexus and brain microvessels, sites of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and the blood-brain barrier, suggesting that it may be involved in the transport of leptin across these barriers to reach the hypothalamus.Previously, we have shown that the secreted form of the leptin receptor, OB-Re, circulates in mouse plasma and is capable of binding to leptin (18Li C. Ioffe E. Fidahusein N. Connolly E. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10078-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence that circulating soluble leptin receptor may arise from both OB-Re mRNA and ectodomain shedding of membrane-spanning OB-R isoforms. We demonstrate that stable cell lines overexpressing OB-Ra or OB-Rb are capable of releasing soluble leptin receptor into the media by proteolytic cleavage, as detected by leptin-Sepharose pull-down assay. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated in vivooverexpression of OB-Ra or OB-Rb also results in release of soluble leptin receptor into plasma in mice via the same mechanism. Ectodomain shedding of both OB-Ra and OB-Rb is detected by a monoclonal antibody recognizing the FLAG epitope tag fused in-frame with the amino terminus of recombinant receptor protein. Stable 293 cells expressing OB-Ra and OB-Rb release the soluble leptin receptor under serum-free conditions, suggesting that the cleavage of membrane-bound receptor may be mediated by proteases resident in the cell. Because the soluble leptin receptor affects leptin's effect on food intake and body weight inob/ob mice (19Huang L. Wang Z. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6343-6349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), regulated ectodomain shedding of membrane-spanning leptin receptors may represent a novel mechanism of regulating leptin's biological activity.DISCUSSIONIn our earlier studies, we demonstrated that the soluble leptin receptor circulates in plasma and is capable of binding to leptin (18Li C. Ioffe E. Fidahusein N. Connolly E. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10078-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our recently published results also demonstrated that the soluble receptor might play key roles in determining the amount of total leptin in circulation (19Huang L. Wang Z. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6343-6349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Other studies also suggest that expression and plasma concentration of the soluble leptin receptor may be regulated (29Gavrilova O. Barr V. Marcus-Samuels B. Reitman M. J. Biol.

However, the origin of circulating soluble leptin receptor in plasma has not been clearly defined, especially as the mRNA splice variant encoding this receptor isoform in humans has not been found (26Chua Jr., S.C.

Bennett L. Chang D. Hecht R. Collins F. Nature. 1996; 382: 589Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), soluble leptin receptor may be an important factor regulating leptin's availability and bioactivity. This hypothesis is supported by findings that in human plasma, soluble leptin receptor represents the major leptin binding activity (27Lammert A. Kiess W. Bottner A. Glasow A. Kratzsch J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 982-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).The main site of expression of the mRNA splice variant encoding the soluble leptin receptor in vivo remains unknown. Previously, we failed to detect a signal for OB-Re when Northern blot analysis was performed (17Fei H. Okano H.J. Li C. Lee G.-H. Zhao C. Darnell R. Friedman J.M. Prod. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7001-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Available data have demonstrated that in mice, OB-Re is expressed by the placenta. Its expression starts at day 14 of pregnancy, peaking just before parturition to about 40-fold the level found in non-pregnant mice (29Gavrilova O. Barr V. Marcus-Samuels B. Reitman M. J. Biol.

In rats and humans, the pregnancy-associated rise of circulating leptin and its soluble receptor is relatively modest, achieving only a 2-fold increaseversus a more than 40-fold increase in mice (33Lewandowski K.

This result is also in agreement with an earlier report on the generation of human soluble leptin receptor from transiently expressed membrane-spanning receptors in tissue culture (20Maamra M. Bidlingmaier M. Postel-Vinay M.C. Wu Z. Strasburger C.J. Ross R.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4389-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Ectodomain shedding by proteolysis to yield soluble intercellular regulators has been observed for many proteins, such as tumor necrosis factor α and transforming growth factor α (34Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). The responsible protease for these proteins, tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme, is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family of metalloproteinases. Molecules that are capable of inhibiting metalloproteinases are being tested as promising reagents for cancer therapy (35Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (2349) Google Scholar). At the present time, the modulation of the soluble leptin receptor on leptin biology is not well understood. Initial evidence of the presence of free and bound leptin in human circulation was obtained by gel-filtration chromatography of plasma containing added 125I-leptin tracers (36Sinha M.K. Opentanova I. Ohannesian J.P. Kolaczynski J.W. Heiman M.L. Hale J. Becker G.W. Bowsher R.R. Stephens T.W. Caro J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). This and later studies showed that obesity is associated with decreasing levels of the circulating soluble leptin receptor in humans, whereas weight loss increases it (37Laimer M. Ebenbichler C.F.

Disord. 2002; 26: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In others studies, obese and normal weight individuals were found to have similar amount of total circulating soluble leptin receptor, yet in the obese most soluble leptin receptor is bound to leptin, whereas in lean individuals a much smaller percentage of soluble leptin receptor is bound to leptin (75% in the obese versus 33% in the lean); thus, the inability to up-regulate circulating soluble leptin receptor could be a factor in the pathogenesis of obesity (36Sinha M.K. Opentanova I. Ohannesian J.P. Kolaczynski J.W. Heiman M.L. Hale J. Becker G.W. Bowsher R.R. Stephens T.W. Caro J.F. J. Clin.

Metab. 2002; 87: 2931-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, a larger percentage of leptin circulates in the free form in the obese (41Wu Z. Bidlingmaier M. Liu C. De Souza E.B. Tschop M. Morrison K.M. Strasburger C.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 2931-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Opposite modifications of circulating levels of leptin and its soluble receptor also occur across the eating-disorder spectrum, with plasma levels of soluble leptin receptor significantly increased in patients with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, but decreased in patients with binge-eating disorder or those who are obese but are non-binge-eating (42Monteleone P. Fabrazzo M. Tortorella A. Fuschino A. Maj M. Mol. Psychiatry. 2002; 7: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Soluble leptin receptor levels are also regulated by gender, adiposity, hormones, and rhLeptin administration (43Chan J.L. Bluher S. Yiannakouris N. Suchard M.A. Kratzsch J. Mantzoros C.S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In aggregate, these studies suggest that the soluble leptin receptor may have important implications for the biological activity of leptin. Preliminary results of ongoing work in our laboratory using transgenic mice overexpressing the soluble leptin receptor support the hypothesis that increased soluble leptin receptor in wild-type mice is associated with decreased adiposity as well as decreased body weight. It is perceivable that future studies will shed more light on the usefulness of developing methods to regulate the generation of the soluble leptin receptor for therapeutic benefit. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone of 167 amino acids (1Zhang Y. Proenca P. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11631) Google Scholar). It has potent weight-reducing effects in vivo (2Campfield L.A. Smith F.J. Guisez Y. Devos R. Burn P. Science. 1995; 269: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3060) Google Scholar, 3Halaas J.L.

Science. 1995; 269: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (3850) Google Scholar). Inob/ob mice, the gene encoding leptin is mutated, resulting in morbid obesity and associated abnormalities, including hyperphagia, hypothermia, diabetes, and infertility. The leptin receptor, OB-R, is a member of the cytokine receptor family (5Tartaglia L.A. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N. Culpepper J. Devos R. Richards G.J. Campfield L.A. Clark F.T. Deeds J. Muir C. Sanker S. Moriarty A. Moore K.J. Smutko J.S. Mays G.G. Woolf E.A. Monroe C.A. Tepper R.I. Cell. 1995; 83: 1263-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). It is encoded by the diabetes (db) gene, mutation of which also results in phenotypes similar to that exhibited byob/ob mice. OB-R is alternatively spliced into at least five transcripts from a single gene. These transcripts encode proteins that are called the long (OB-Rb), short (OB-Ra, -c, and -d), and soluble (OB-Re) forms of the leptin receptor. With the exception of the soluble leptin receptor, other receptor isoforms differ from each other by the alternative use of a unique terminal coding exon (6Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). OB-Rb is essential in mediating leptin's weight-reducing effects via the hypothalamus (6Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar, 7Chen H. Charlat O. Tartaglia L.A. Woolf E.A. Weng X. Ellis S.J. Lakey N.D. Culpepper J. Moore K.J. Breitbart R.E. Duyk G.M. Tepper R.I. Morgenstern J.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 491-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). OB-R is expressed in both the nervous system and in peripheral tissues. The relative expression levels of different receptor isoforms vary among tissues, possibly to allow leptin's biological activity to be more precisely regulated at various leptin target sites (8Ghilardi N. Ziegler S. Wiestner A. Stoffel R. Heim M.H. Skoda R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6231-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). OB-Rb is enriched in the hypothalamus, the site of leptin's action on food intake and body weight. Leptin activation of OB-Rb within this brain region results in the inhibition of neuropeptide Y/agouti-related protein neurons and activation of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons (9Friedman J.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Leptin-activated pro-opiomelanocortin neurons become depolarized and release anorexigenic peptides; leptin-inhibited neuropeptide Y/agouti-related protein neurons become hyperpolarized and reduce the release of orexigenic peptides (10Cowley M.A. Smart J.L.

Ohannesian J.P. Kolaczynski J.W. Heiman M.L. Hale J. Becker G.W. Bowsher R.R. Stephens T.W. Caro J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). This and later studies showed that obesity is associated with decreasing levels of the circulating soluble leptin receptor in humans, whereas weight loss increases it (37Laimer M. Ebenbichler C.F.

In others studies, obese and normal weight individuals were found to have similar amount of total circulating soluble leptin receptor, yet in the obese most soluble leptin receptor is bound to leptin, whereas in lean individuals a much smaller percentage of soluble leptin receptor is bound to leptin (75% in the obese versus 33% in the lean); thus, the inability to up-regulate circulating soluble leptin receptor could be a factor in the pathogenesis of obesity (36Sinha M.K.

Tschop M. Morrison K.M. Strasburger C.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 2931-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Opposite modifications of circulating levels of leptin and its soluble receptor also occur across the eating-disorder spectrum, with plasma levels of soluble leptin receptor significantly increased in patients with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, but decreased in patients with binge-eating disorder or those who are obese but are non-binge-eating (42Monteleone P. Fabrazzo M. Tortorella A. Fuschino A. Maj M. Mol. Psychiatry. 2002; 7: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Soluble leptin receptor levels are also regulated by gender, adiposity, hormones, and rhLeptin administration (43Chan J.L. Bluher S. Yiannakouris N. Suchard M.A. Kratzsch J. Mantzoros C.S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In aggregate, these studies suggest that the soluble leptin receptor may have important implications for the biological activity of leptin. Preliminary results of ongoing work in our laboratory using transgenic mice overexpressing the soluble leptin receptor support the hypothesis that increased soluble leptin receptor in wild-type mice is associated with decreased adiposity as well as decreased body weight. It is perceivable that future studies will shed more light on the usefulness of developing methods to regulate the generation of the soluble leptin receptor for therapeutic benefit. In our earlier studies, we demonstrated that the soluble leptin receptor circulates in plasma and is capable of binding to leptin (18Li C. Ioffe E. Fidahusein N. Connolly E. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10078-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our recently published results also demonstrated that the soluble receptor might play key roles in determining the amount of total leptin in circulation (19Huang L. Wang Z. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6343-6349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Other studies also suggest that expression and plasma concentration of the soluble leptin receptor may be regulated (29Gavrilova O. Barr V. Marcus-Samuels B. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30546-30551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 30Widjaja A. Kielstein J.T. Horn R. von Zur Muhlen A. Kliem V. Brabant G. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2000; 15: 846-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the origin of circulating soluble leptin receptor in plasma has not been clearly defined, especially as the mRNA splice variant encoding this receptor isoform in humans has not been found (26Chua Jr., S.C. Koutras I.K. Han L. Liu S.M. Kay J. Young S.J. Chung W.K. Leibel R.L. Genomics. 1997; 45: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because no post-translational modification of leptin occurs in vivo (31Cohen S.L. Halaas J.L. Friedman J.M. Chait B.T. Bennett L. Chang D. Hecht R. Collins F. Nature. 1996; 382: 589Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), soluble leptin receptor may be an important factor regulating leptin's availability and bioactivity. This hypothesis is supported by findings that in human plasma, soluble leptin receptor represents the major leptin binding activity (27Lammert A. Kiess W. Bottner A. Glasow A. Kratzsch J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 982-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The main site of expression of the mRNA splice variant encoding the soluble leptin receptor in vivo remains unknown. Previously, we failed to detect a signal for OB-Re when Northern blot analysis was performed (17Fei H. Okano H.J. Li C. Lee G.-H. Zhao C. Darnell R. Friedman J.M. Prod. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7001-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Available data have demonstrated that in mice, OB-Re is expressed by the placenta. Its expression starts at day 14 of pregnancy, peaking just before parturition to about 40-fold the level found in non-pregnant mice (29Gavrilova O. Barr V. Marcus-Samuels B. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30546-30551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 32Yamaguchi M. Murakami T. Yasui Y. Otani S. Kawai M. Kishi K. Kurachi H. Shima K. Aono T. Murata Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In rats and humans, the pregnancy-associated rise of circulating leptin and its soluble receptor is relatively modest, achieving only a 2-fold increaseversus a more than 40-fold increase in mice (33Lewandowski K. Horn R. O'Callaghan C.J. Dunlop D. Medley G.F. O'Hare P. Brabant G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our current study provided evidence of an additional mechanism for the generation of soluble leptin receptor by ectodomain shedding of membrane-spanning receptor, both in vitro and in vivo. This result is also in agreement with an earlier report on the generation of human soluble leptin receptor from transiently expressed membrane-spanning receptors in tissue culture (20Maamra M. Bidlingmaier M. Postel-Vinay M.C. Wu Z. Strasburger C.J. Ross R.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4389-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Ectodomain shedding by proteolysis to yield soluble intercellular regulators has been observed for many proteins, such as tumor necrosis factor α and transforming growth factor α (34Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). The responsible protease for these proteins, tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme, is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family of metalloproteinases. Molecules that are capable of inhibiting metalloproteinases are being tested as promising reagents for cancer therapy (35Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M.

Dominant-negative “knockout” of Kv2 family channels enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Here we show that a putative Kv2.1 antagonist (C-1) stimulates insulin secretion from MIN6 insulinoma cells in a glucose- and dose-dependent manner while blocking voltage-dependent outward K+currents. C-1-blocked recombinant Kv2.1-mediated currents more specifically than currents mediated by Kv1, -3, and -4 family channels (Kv1.4, 3.1, 4.2). Additionally, C-1 had little effect on currents recorded from MIN6 cells expressing a dominant-negative Kv2.1 α-subunit. The insulinotropic effect of acute Kv2.1 inhibition resulted from enhanced membrane depolarization and augmented intracellular Ca2+ responses to glucose. Immunohistochemical staining of mouse pancreas sections showed that expression of Kv2.1 correlated highly with insulin-containing β-cells, consistent with the ability of C-1 to block voltage-dependent outward K+ currents in isolated mouse β-cells. Antagonism of Kv2.1 in an ex vivoperfused mouse pancreas model enhanced first- and second-phase insulin secretion, whereas glucagon secretion was unaffected. The present study demonstrates that Kv2.1 is an important component of β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling, and a compound that enhances, but does not initiate, β-cell electrical activity by acting on Kv2.1 would be a useful antidiabetic agent.

Peripheral insulin resistance and defects in insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells characterize type-2 diabetes mellitus (1Dagogo-Jack S. Santiago J.V. Arch. Intern. Med. 1997; 157: 1802-1817Google Scholar). The β-cell defect of type-2 diabetes mellitus is most commonly treated with the sulfonylurea class of compounds (2Boyd III, A.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 48: 235-241Google Scholar, 3Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Google Scholar). Sulfonylureas antagonize ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, depolarizing the membrane, opening voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, and stimulating insulin secretion (4Dunne M.J. Cosgrove K.E. Shepherd R.M. Ammala C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 146-152Google Scholar). This essentially mimics the effect of an increased intracellular ATP/ADP ratio resulting from elevated glucose metabolism in the fed state as described in a number of reviews (3Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Google Scholar, 5Dukes I.D. Philipson L.H. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 845-853Google Scholar, 6Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev.

Because sulfonylurea drugs act in a glucose-independent manner, hypoglycemic episodes are a major concern (8Hayward R.A. Manning W.G. Kaplan S.H. Wagner E.H. Greenfield S. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1997; 278: 1663-1669Google Scholar). Currently, glucose-dependent insulinotropic agents are a major focus of investigation for the development of safer and more appropriate therapeutic agents. Voltage-dependent outward K+ currents have been detected in β-cells and are believed to mediate action potential repolarization (5Dukes I.D. Philipson L.H.

Indeed, previous studies show that the general voltage-dependent K+(Kv) 1The abbreviations used are: Kv, voltage-dependent K+; KCa, Ca2+-sensitive voltage-dependent K+; TEA, tetraethylammonium; RT, room temperature; GSIS, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; ITX, iberiotoxin; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; ECFP, enhanced CFP; AUC, area under the curve. and Ca2+-sensitive voltage-dependent K+(KCa) channel antagonist tetraethylammonium (TEA) augments membrane depolarization (12Atwater I.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 551-556Google Scholar) in a glucose-dependent manner. Recently, we have reported that dominant-negative knockout of Kv2 channels reduced outward K+ currents by 60–70% in rat β-cells and HIT-T15 insulinoma cells and caused a doubling of the insulin secretion response of rat islets to glucose (16MacDonald P.E.

Kv2.1 likely plays this regulatory role because its protein expression is high in insulin-secreting cells (16MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32241-32246Google Scholar), and mRNA for Kv2.2, the only other Kv2 family α-subunit known to form functional channels, could not be detected by reverse transcription-PCR (16MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Google Scholar). To investigate the functional importance of Kv2.1 and the mechanism by which this channel regulates β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling, we have now examined the effect of acute Kv2.1 inhibition. We report that a small molecule bispidine derivative (termed C-1) related to class III antiarrhythmic agents specifically antagonizes Kv2.1 in insulin-secreting cells, enhances membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) responses to glucose, and increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from insulinoma cells and perfused mouse pancreas. The present study demonstrates an important role for Kv2.1 in ionic stimulus-secretion coupling of insulin secretion and reinforces the view that agents that enhance, but do not initiate, β-cell electrical activity by acting on Kv2.1 would be useful therapeutic agents, stimulating only postprandial insulin secretion. TEA chloride was from Sigma-Aldrich. Iberiotoxin (ITX) was from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel). Glibenclamide (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared as a 10 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The putative Kv2.1 antagonist (4-chloro-benzoic acid 3-(4-benzo[1,3]dioxol-5-yl-butyl)-7-methyl-3,7-diaza-bicyclo[3.3.1]non-9-yl ester), a bispidine derivative termed compound 1 (C-1), was resuspended in Me2SO at 10 mm from lyophilized stock. Control solutions contained an equal amount of Me2SO that did not exceed 0.05% of the final solution. MIN6 insulinoma cells (P29–40) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 2 μl/500 ml β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The tsA-201 cell line, a HEK-293 derived cell line stably expressing an SV40 T antigen (18O'Leary M.E. Horn R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 507-522Google Scholar, 19Margolskee R.F. McHendry-Rinde B. Horn R. Biotechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911Google Scholar), was cultured in the above media without β-mercaptoethanol. Two days before insulin secretion experiments, cells were trypsinized and plated in 12-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/well. For electrophysiology and [Ca2+]i measurements, cells were trypsinized and plated on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes 24 h before use. Cell transfection was with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Islets were isolated from female CD-1 mice (6 weeks) using a collagenase digestion/histopaque-1077 protocol adapted from that described previously (16MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Google Scholar). Islets were dispersed to single cells by treatment with 0.015% trypsin (Invitrogen) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 10 min. Islet cells were plated on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes in RMPI media supplemented with 2.5 mmglucose, 0.25% Hepes, 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and cultured for 1–3 days before electrophysiological recordings. Insulin secretion experiments were performed in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 24 mmNaHCO3, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin as described previously (16MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Google Scholar). Radioimmunoassay was performed using the rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit from Linco Research Inc. (St. Louis, MO). All MIN6 cell insulin secretion experiments were performed with an n ≥ 9, and data were normalized to controls. Data were analyzed using Student's unpaired t test or a one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett post-test to compare each value versus control. Ap value <0.05 was considered significant. The EC50 for dose response of C-1 was determined by fitting to a variable slope sigmoidal curve, Y = min + (max − min)/ (1 + 10(log EC50 [minus] x)n), with Origin 3.5 (Microcal Software, Northhampton, MA). MIN6 cells, tsA-201 cells, or mouse β-cells were patch-clamped in the whole-cell or perforated-patch configuration using an EPC-9 amplifier and PULSE software (HEKA Electronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Patch pipettes, prepared as described previously (16MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Google Scholar), had typical resistances of 3–5 megaohms when fire-polished. For whole-cell studies extracellular solutions contained 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 4 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2·6H2O, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3 with NaOH, and intracellular solutions contained 140 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgATP, pH 7.25 with KOH. β-cells were identified by the lack of a transient voltage-dependent inward Na+ current as described by Gopel et al. (20Gopel S.O. Kanno T. Barg S. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 528: 497-507Google Scholar, 21Gopel S. Kanno T. Barg S. Galvanovskis J. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 521: 717-728Google Scholar), and results were confirmed in β-cells identified by membrane potential responses to glucose in the perforated-patch configuration. Outward currents were elicited by 500-ms depolarizations from holding potentials of −90 or −50 mV to +30 mV. Alternatively, current-voltage relationship curves were generated by depolarizing cells from a holding potential of −70 mV in 20-mV increments to +70 mV. Sustained outward current was taken as the mean current during the last 25 ms of the depolarizing pulse. For perforated-patch studies, extracellular solutions contained 140 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 2.6 mmCaCl2, 2 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mmMgSO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH and either 2.5 or 11.1 mm glucose, and intracellular solutions contained 76 mm K2SO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.35 with KOH. Membrane potential was recorded in the absence of current injection (I = 0). Experiments were discontinued if cells were unresponsive to glucose. The amplifier was occasionally switched to voltage-clamp mode to verify seal resistance and to determine voltage-dependant outward K+ current amplitude with a single depolarizing pulse from −70 mV to +30 mV for 500 ms. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained at 32–35 °C unless stated otherwise and normalized to cell capacitance. For pharmacological studies, compounds were applied for at least 5 min before current recording. IC50 values of current block were estimated by fitting a dose response to anI/I max-modified Hill function (I/I max = ((X/IC50)n + c)/(1 + (X/IC50)n − c)) with Origin 3.5 (Microcal Software). Activation curves were fit to a one-phase exponential association function with Prism 3.03 (Graphpad Software, San Diego) to derive activation time constants. Sustained outward currents were compared with the Student's unpaired t test (p < 0.05 considered significant). Steady-state current-voltage relationships were compared by one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey post-test to compare currents at individual voltages (p < 0.05 considered significant). The C-terminal-truncated Kv2.1 subunit (Kv2.1N) has been described previously (16MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Google Scholar). This construct was expressed with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a marker by insertion into the pIRES-EGFP plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) or without EGFP by insertion into the Adlox plasmid. Rat Kv2.1 and 3.1 constructs fused with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) on the N terminus in the pECFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech) were from O. T. Jones (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK), whereas the wild-type Kv2.1 and Kv3.1 cDNAs were originally from R. H. Joho (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The Kv3.1 cDNA was also inserted into the pIRES-EGFP plasmid (Clontech) to allow EGFP co-expression as a marker for transfected cells. Cloned Kv1.4 and 4.2 in the GW1H plasmid were from R. J. Hajjar (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). These constructs were co-transfected with empty pIRES-EGFP plasmid (Clontech) to identify transfected cells by EGFP expression. All plasmids express the protein of interest under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Imaging was performed using equipment described previously (22Leung Y.M. Sheu L. Kwan E. Wang G. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 980-986Google Scholar). Cells on glass coverslips were loaded with 4 μm Fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min at 37 °C. Solutions were continuously perfused in a heated recording chamber at 3 ml/min at 32–35 °C. Images were obtained with 340- and 380-nm excitation and a 510-nm cutoff emission filter. Exposures lasted 0.2 s, and images were acquired at ∼0.2 Hz. Images were analyzed using Merlin software with [Ca2+]i calculated using the Grynkiewicz equation: [Ca2+]i =K d × β × (R −R min)/(R max −R). Fura-2-AM fluorescence was calibrated to Ca2+ concentration using 10 μm ionomycin in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 for maximal fluorescence ratio or with no added Ca2+ and 10 mm EGTA for minimal fluorescence ratio. The values obtained were R min = 0.2, R max = 2, and β = 3. A value of 224 nm for the apparentK d of Ca2+ binding to Fura-2 was used. Immunoblotting of Kv channel proteins was performed as previously described (16MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Google Scholar). Twenty-five μg of protein from each sample was separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF-PlusTM membrane (Fisher). Primary antibodies (Kv2.1, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY; Kv1.4 and 4.2, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) or antibody-antigen solutions (diluted as per suppliers instructions) were detected with appropriate secondary antibodies (sheep anti-mouse, 1:3000, and donkey anti-rabbit, 1:7500; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at RT. Visualization was by chemiluminescence (ECL, AmershamBiosciences) and exposure to Kodak film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 5 s to 10 min. Mouse pancreas sections (60 μm) were prepared for immunocytochemistry as described previously (23Chan C.B. MacDonald P.E. Saleh M.C. Johns D.C. Marban E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1482-1486Google Scholar). Immunostaining was carried out on free-floating serial sections of pancreas permeabilized with 0.04% Triton-X-100 in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at RT (24Hwang P.M. Fotuhi M. Bredt D.S. Cunningham A.M. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1569-1576Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were rabbit anti-Kv2.1 (Alomone Labs; 10 μg/ml) and guinea-pig anti-insulin (a gift of R. A. Pederson, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; 1:1000). Antibodies were applied for 1 h at RT on a rocking platform then overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit-fluorescein at 1:200 and rabbit anti-guinea-pig horseradish peroxidase, applied for 2 h at RT with rocking. The latter was developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Immunostained sections were mounted on poly-l-lysine-treated glass slides. Sections with fluorescein secondary antibody were cover-slipped using the Slow Fade Light Antifade Solution from Molecular Probes. Female CD-1 mice (6 weeks; Charles River Canada, Montreal, Canada) were fasted overnight (15–18 h) and anesthetized with 80 mg/kg intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital. The surgical procedure for perfusion of the pancreas was similar to that described previously (25Grodsky G.M. Batts A.A. Bennett L.L. Vcella C. McWilliams N.B. Smith D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1963; 205: 638-644Google Scholar, 26Pederson R.A. Satkunarajah M. McIntosh C.H. Scrocchi L.A. Flamez D. Schuit F. Drucker D.J. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1046-1052Google Scholar). In brief, PE 50 tubing (Intramedic, Parsippany, NJ) was used for blood vessel cannulation, and the perfusate was a modified Krebs-Ringer, 2% bovine serum albumin, glucose, 3% dextran solution. The solution was gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 to achieve a pH of 7.4. Glucose was switched between 1.4 and 13.4 mm to stimulate insulin secretion. Glucagon secretion was measured in the presence of 5 mm glucose, a concentration intermediate to that required for maximum stimulation or inhibition (27Silvestre R.A. Rodriguez-Gallardo J. Jodka C. Parkes D.G. Pittner R.A. Young A.A. Marco J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E443-E449Google Scholar). The infusion pump was a Minipuls 3 (Gilson Inc., Middleton, WI). Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post-test to compare time points. Area under the curves (AUCs) were compared using the Student's unpaired t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Kv2.1 is expressed in rat islets, HIT-T15 cells, and βTC cells (5Dukes I.D. Philipson L.H. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 845-853Google Scholar, 16MacDonald P.E.

Western blotting confirmed Kv2.1 expression in MIN6 cell protein lysates (Fig.1 A). As reported previously (13Henquin J.C. Meissner H.P. Preissler M. Biochim. Biophys.

Pflugers Arch. 1990; 416: 568-572Google Scholar), the general Kv/KCa channel antagonist TEA (15 mm) enhanced only GSIS but had no significant effect in the absence of glucose (Fig. 1 B). Similar to TEA, the putative small molecule Kv2.1 antagonist C-1 enhanced insulin secretion from MIN6 cells in a glucose- and dose-dependent (EC50 = 546.7 ± 1.1 nm, n= 9–15) manner (Fig. 1). This is in contrast to the effect of glibenclamide (500 nm), a KATP channel antagonist, which stimulated insulin secretion even in the absence of glucose (Fig. 1 B). At the maximum dose of 2 μm, C-1 enhanced GSIS by 209.1 ± 24.7% (n = 9, p < 0.01) compared with control. Outward K+ currents were elicited from MIN6 cells voltage-clamped in the whole-cell configuration at 32–35 °C (Fig. 2 A). Current amplitudes were similar to those reported previously from rat islet cells at RT (16MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Google Scholar) but inactivated to a greater extent (∼50% greater than 500 ms). Inclusion of 1 mm EGTA and 5 mm MgATP resulted in a minimal contribution from KCa or KATP channels. Therefore the outward currents observed reflect the opening of Kv channels. Sustained outward K+ currents were 85.2 ± 1.8% (n = 4,p < 0.001) inhibited by 15 mm TEA (Fig.2 A). C-1 (500 nm) inhibited sustained outward K+ current from MIN6 cells specifically (77.2 ± 4.3%, n = 8, p < 0.001) while having little effect on an inactivating component (Fig. 2 A and3 C). The inhibitory effect of C-1 on sustained currents was dose-dependent, with an IC50 of 155.7 ± 16.8 nm and a Hill coefficient of 5.2 ± 1.8 (n = 7–8), suggesting multiple binding sites or co-operative binding of the compound (Fig. 2 B). The inactivating portion of MIN6 outward K+ currents could be selectively abolished by holding at more positive potentials (−50 mV), allowing separation of inactivating and non-inactivating currents (Fig.3 C). These inactivating currents could conceivably result from expression of the TEA-insensitive Kv1.4 and/or Kv4.2 channels (29Conley E.C. Conley E.C. Brammar W.J. The Ion Channel FactsBook IV: Voltage-gated Channels. Academic Press, Inc., London1999: 374-532Google Scholar, 30Conley E.C. Conley E.C. Brammar W.J. VLG K Kv4-Shal. in The Ion Channel FactsBook IV: Voltage-gated Channels. Academic Press, Inc., London1999: 617-646Google Scholar) (detected by Western blot, not shown). However, the sensitivity of these currents to TEA suggest they may be mediated by the TEA-sensitive Kv3.4 channel detected in mouse β-cells (20Gopel S.O. Kanno T. Barg S. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 528: 497-507Google Scholar). These inactivating currents are consistent with the previous detection of small inactivating outward K+ currents in rodent β-cells at RT (16MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Google Scholar, 20Gopel S.O. Kanno T. Barg S. Rorsman P. J. Physiol.

Pflugers Arch. 1989; 413: 441-443Google Scholar) and with the inactivating current that remains when Kv2.1 channel function is disrupted (see below and Fig. 3).Figure 3C-1 inhibits Kv2.1 currents in MIN6 cells. In panel A, co-expression of Kv2.1N prevented membrane targeting of an ECFP-tagged Kv2.1 construct (Kv2.1-CFP) but did not affect membrane expression of an ECFP-tagged Kv3.1 construct (Kv3.1-CFP). Images were obtained using a laser-scanning confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective. The membrane/cytoplasm fluorescence intensity ratio (F(memb)/F(cyt) was quantified in panel B. Co-expression of Kv2.1N prevented membrane targeting of Kv2.1-CFP compared with controls (n = 8 and 11) but did not affect targeting of Kv3.1-CFP (n = 12 and 10). In panel C, outward K+ currents were recorded from control (left panels) or Kv2.1N-expressing (right panels) MIN6 cells. The inactivating current component was derived by subtracting currents elicited from −50 mV from currents elicited from −90 mV. In control cells, C-1 (500 nm, arrows) largely blocked the non-inactivating current, whereas inactivating current was unaffected. In Kv2.1N-expressing cells, C-1 (500 nm, arrows) did not effect either non-inactivating or inactivating currents. The traces shown are averages from 7 (control) and 5 (Kv2.1N) cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the specificity of the bispidine derivative C-1 for Kv2.1, we first studied the effect of this compound in MIN6 cells expressing a dominant-negative Kv2.1 channel subunit (Kv2.1N) previously used to reduce Kv2 currents in HIT-T15 cells and rat β-cells (16MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Google Scholar). Laser-scanning confocal microscopy and quantification of the membrane/cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity ratio (F(memb)/F(cyt)) confirmed that Kv2.1N expression inhibits plasma membrane targeting of an enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP)-Kv2.1 fusion protein (p < 0.001,n = 8) while not affecting a related ECFP-tagged full-length Kv3.1 subunit (n = 12) (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained using an EGFP-tagged Kv2.1N construct. 2P. E. MacDonald and M. B. Wheeler, unpublished data. In MIN6 cells expressing Kv2.1N, non-inactivating outward K+ currents were reduced (by 63.6 ± 4.7%,n = 5, p < 0.001), whereas inactivating currents were unaffected (Fig. 3 C, right panels). The remaining outward K+ currents in these cells were only marginally inhibited by C-1 (500 nm, Fig.3 C, right panels), which reduced outward K+ currents from control MIN6 cells by 77.2 ± 4.3% (p < 0.001, n = 8, Fig. 3 C,left panels, indicated by arrows). C-1 did not inhibit inactivating currents (Fig. 3 C, bottom panels) and blocked non-inactivating currents only slightly in cells expressing Kv2.1N (9.3 ± 3.9% compared with controls) (Fig. 3 C, middle right panel). The small effect of C-1 on non-inactivating currents in Kv2.1N-expressing cells may be attributed to residual Kv2.1 channels at the membrane or an inhibitory effect on non-Kv2.1 channels. The specificity of C-1 for Kv2.1 over related K+ channels was investigated further in cells overexpressing wild-type Kv channels. Kv2.1 channels expressed in tsA-201 cells at RT were blocked by C-1 with a similar IC50 (164.0 ± 6.1 nm, Hill coefficient = 1.3, n = 6) as native MIN6 currents. Currents mediated by Kv1.4 were blocked with an IC50 of 2205 ± 198.2 nm (Hill coefficient = 1.2,n = 6), whereas Kv3.1 (IC50 = 3627 ± 509.0 nm, Hill coefficient = 0.87, n = 6) and Kv4.2 (IC50 = 3429 ± 78.2 nm, Hill coefficient = 0.97, n = 6) were even less sensitive to block by C-1. Additionally, we investigated the effect of C-1 on Kv channels overexpressed in MIN6 cells at 32–35 °C. Results were similar to those obtained in tsA-201 cells in that Kv2.1 (IC50 = 247.5 ± 45.8 nm, Hill coefficient = 1.7, n = 6) was blocked more potently than Kv1.4 (IC50 = 2964 ± 32.3 nm, Hill coefficient = 1.0, n = 6) or Kv3.1 (IC50 = 914.0 ± 87.5 nm, Hill coefficient = 0.97, n = 6). To confirm that the effect of Kv2.1 inhibition is downstream of KATP channel inhibition, we used diazoxide to prevent KATP channel closure and membrane depolarization. Diazoxide (250 μm) caused a 56.8 ± 8.4% decrease in GSIS (p < 0.001, n = 9; Fig.4 A). In the presence of diazoxide (250 μm), the effect of C-1 (500 nm) was not significant (n = 9, Fig.4 A). Similarly, prevention of Ca2+ entry by antagonism of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels with verapamil (100 μm) reduced GSIS by 51.1 ± 4.1% (p < 0.001, n = 9) and prevented the insulinotropic effect of C-1 (500 nm, n= 9, Fig. 4 B). Intracellular Ca2+ and membrane potential responses to glucose were measured in MIN6 cells. Of 471 cells in 19 separate experiments, 326 responded to 10 mm glucose with an increase in [Ca2+]i. TEA (15 mm) and C-1 (500 nm) augmented [Ca2+]iresponses in 86.3 ± 3.8 and 76.0 ± 5.8% of glucose-responsive cells, respectively (Fig.5, C and D). Importantly, C-1 neither directly augmented Ca2+ currents elicited by step depolarizations (1 μm, not shown) nor blocked KATP currents in MIN6 cells and rat β-cells as measured using a voltage ramp protocol (500 nm, not shown). Interestingly, TEA produced oscillations in [Ca2+]i (in 77.6 ± 13.3% of responsive cells), whereas Kv2.1 inhibition with C-"

Following gene regulation, STAT activity in the nucleus is then terminated by a nuclear protein phosphatase(s), which remains unidentified. Using novel antibody arrays to screen the Stat1-specific protein phosphatase(s), we identified a SHP-2-Stat1 interaction in the A431 cell nucleus. SHP-2 and Stat1 nuclear localization and their association in response to either epidermal growth factor or interferon-γ (IFNγ) were confirmed by immunofluorescent staining and affinity precipitation assays. The SHP-2 C-terminal region containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity interacted with the C-terminal SH2 transcriptional activation domain of Stat1. In SHP-2−/− mouse fibroblast cells, Stat1 phosphorylation at both the tyrosine residue Tyr701 and the serine residue Ser727 by IFNγ was enhanced and prolonged. Consistently, purified GST-SHP-2 dephosphorylated Stat1 at both tyrosine and serine residues when immunoprecipitated phospho-Stat1 or a peptide corresponding to the sequence surrounding Tyr(P)701 or Ser(P)727 of Stat1 was used as the substrate. Overexpression of SHP-2 in 293T cells inhibited IFNγ-dependent Stat1 phosphorylation and suppressed Stat1-dependent induction of luciferase activity.

Activation of STAT proteins requires post-translational modification, i.e.phosphorylation at both tyrosine and serine residues. Upon translocation into the nucleus, these proteins activate specific target genes by binding to regulatory sequences termed c-sis inducible elements (SIE). A variety of protein-tyrosine kinases, transmembranal or non-transmembranal, such as JAK, EGFR, and Src induce STAT tyrosine phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the single tyrosine residue in the transcriptional activation domain of STAT is essential for STAT dimer formation. STAT serine phosphorylation, on the other hand, requires both ERK-dependent and -independent activation pathways (1Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Google Scholar, 2David M. Petricoin III, E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation is critical for STAT to achieve full transcriptional activity even though it is not essential for STAT nuclear translocation and DNA binding. Thus, phosphorylation at both the positional-conserved tyrosine and serine residues corresponding to Tyr701 and Ser727 of human Stat1 is required for its maximal transcription activity (3Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Google Scholar). IFNγ activation of STAT proceeds to phosphorylate both tyrosine and serine residues, and these two events appear to be independent of each other (4Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Google Scholar). Jak1 and Jak2 functions are both required for IFNγ to induce Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation. However, Jak2 has also been reported to be involved in Stat1 serine phosphorylation in response to IFNγ (5Zhu X. Wen Z. Xu L.Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6618-6623Google Scholar). EGFR- activated STATs are also tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated. Although associated with the EGFR C-terminal, JAKs are not involved in EGFR-mediated STAT activation (6David M. Wong L. Flavell R. Thompson S.A. Wells A. Larner A.C. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9185-9188Google Scholar, 7Olayioye M. Beuvink A.I. Horsch K. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17209-17218Google Scholar). STAT post-translational modification such as tyrosine and serine phosphorylation has been elegantly studied. The precise mechanism of the inactivation, however, has only recently started to be investigated. JAK-specific inhibitors such as SOCS and inhibitors of activated STAT such as PIAS have been discovered (8Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Google Scholar, 9Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T.

Akira S. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 924-929Google Scholar). STAT inactivation includes both maintaining STAT latency and terminating activated STAT by dephosphorylation. Dephosphorylation, however, may represent one of the most important mechanisms by which cells negatively control STAT activity. Treatment of cells with protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors such as vanadate leads to STAT activation, indicating that PTP(s) is required for maintaining STAT in its inactive form. Upon cytokine or growth factor stimulation, STATs are rapidly phosphorylated at both tyrosine and serine residues and bind DNA, which is followed by STAT dephosphorylation and dissociation from DNA. Phosphatases therefore control STAT activity at two levels: (i) maintaining STAT in its latent form by blocking phosphorylation and (ii) terminating STAT activity by removing available phosphates. This suggests that the balance between protein kinases and protein phosphatases play an important role in modulating the activity of STATs in vivo (11Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Google Scholar, 12Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Google Scholar). The protein phosphatases responsible for STAT dephosphorylation in nucleus has yet to be confirmed (13Haspel R.L. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10188-10193Google Scholar). The present study was initiated to identify the protein phosphatase(s) responsible for STAT dephosphorylation in nuclei. By employing our novel antibody array screening for protein-protein interaction, we identified SHP-2 and Stat1 association in A431 cells. Treatment of A431 cells with either EGF or IFNγ led to Stat1 and SHP-2 accumulation in nucleus where these two proteins interact with each other within their C-terminal regions. We provide evidence here that SHP-2 is a dual-specificity protein phosphatase involved in Stat1 dephosphorylation at both Tyr(P)701 and Ser(P)727 residues. The cDNA of full-length SHP-2 (amino acid residues 1–593), N-SH2 domain (residues 1–107), C-SH2 domain (residues 108–220), N-SH2-C-SH2 (residues 1–220), C-SH2PTP (residues 108–593), or PTP domain (residues 221–593) was inserted at the 3′-end and in-frame to the GST open reading frame in the expression vector pGEX-3T (Amersham Biosciences). Bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and dialyzed overnight. Human Stat1 cDNA of full-length (residues 1–750), C-terminal (residues 489–750), N-terminal (residues 1–488), and SH2-TA domain (residues 577–750) were tagged with His6by inserting them into the pET28A vector. Expression of recombinant His6-Stat1 proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting using both anti-His6 and anti-Stat1 antibodies. SH-2−/− and control mouse fibroblasts (14You M. Yu D-H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2416-2424Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A431 cells, 293T cells, and both SHP-2−/− and control mouse fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Whole cell lysates were prepared by using radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with proteinase inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin; and 1 mmdithiothreitol) freshly added as described previously (15Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.-C.S. You Z.-H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Google Scholar, 16Wang Y.J. Wu T.R. Cai S.Y. Welte T. Chin Y.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4505-4512Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic fraction was prepared by lysing cells in Hepes buffer (20 mm, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) with dithiothreitol and the above inhibitors freshly added. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic lysates. The nuclear fraction was obtained by resuspending the crude nuclei in 420 mm NaCl for 30 min, and the supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 min (17Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Preparation of antibody arrays was essentially as described (16Wang Y.J. Wu T.R. Cai S.Y. Welte T. Chin Y.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4505-4512Google Scholar). Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against different protein phosphatases were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, New England BioLabs, Zymed Laboratories, and Transduction Laboratory. All antibodies (0.2 μg/spot) were immobilized onto PVDF membranes (2 × 3 cm) manually. After preincubation with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, which reduces nonspecific binding of other proteins in subsequent steps, the antibody arrays were incubated with cell lysates for an additional 2 h at room temperature. After three PBS washes, the antibody arrays were immunoblotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Stat1 antibody followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) analysis. Phospho-Stat1 was immunopurified from IFNγ-treated SHP-2−/− fibroblasts by using the rabbit polyclonal antibody specifically against [Tyr(P)701]Stat1. Such immunoprecipitated phospho-Stat1 was then incubated with GST-SHP-2 in the Hepes reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 10 min at room temperature followed by boiling in 2× loading buffer for 5 min. The boiled samples were then analyzed in an immunoblot. When synthesized phosphopeptides were used as the substrate, a Malachite Green assay was performed to detect released inorganic phosphate (Pi) as described elsewhere (18Bone H. Dechert U. Jirik F.R. Schrader J.W. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14470-14476Google Scholar, 19Harder K.W. Moller N.P. Peacock J.W. Jirik F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31890-31900Google Scholar). Specifically, in 25-μl reaction volumes with duplicates, 0–2 mm phosphopeptide (CDDPKRTGpYIKTE or DNLLPMpSPEEFDE) was mixed with 0.1 μg of GST-SHP-2, GST-PTP, or GST control in Hepes buffer for 5 min at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by addition of 50 μl of Malachite Green reagent (18Bone H. Dechert U. Jirik F.R. Schrader J.W. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14470-14476Google Scholar). After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, released Pi was measured using a 96-well plate reader at absorbance 620 nm. Values for picomoles of Pi released were obtained by comparison with a standard curve of Malachite Green. The velocity of product formation is defined as micromoles of Pireleased/min/mg of enzyme. The radiolabeled serine dephosphorylation assay was performed according to the method published previously (20Hannon G.J. Casso D. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 19: 1731-1735Google Scholar).32P-labeled MyBP was prepared by phosphorylation on multiple serine residues with the cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) overnight in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England BioLabs). The reaction was terminated by adding 10% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate the phosphoprotein and inactivate the protein. Labeled MyBP was purified from residual ATP by washing with trichloroacetic acid and overnight dialysis. Protein serine phosphatase activity was then determined by mixing 10 μl of 32P-labeled MyBP, 30 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Brij 35), and 10 μl of purified GST fusion protein as indicated, for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid and placed on ice for 5 min before centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant containing released 32P was then measured in scintillation counting solution. Similarly, His6-tailed peptide (HHHHHHDNLLPMSPEEFDE) was labeled at the serine residue with [γ-32P]ATP with the MAP kinase Erk2 purchased from New England Biolabs. Such a serine 32P-labeled peptide was incubated with different forms of GST fusion proteins at room temperature for 15 min followed by precipitation with Ni2+-NTA beads. The Ni2+-NTA bead-precipitated peptides were then submitted for scintillation counting after extensive washes. Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and immunoblotting assays were performed essentially as described previously (12Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Google Scholar, 16Wang Y.J. Wu T.R. Cai S.Y. Welte T. Chin Y.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4505-4512Google Scholar, 17Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Google Scholar). For immunostaining, cells plated on the chamber slides were treated with EGF or IFNγ for 30 min. Cells were fixed for 5 min in methanol and preincubated with 10% normal blocking serum in PBS for 20 min according to the manufacturer's protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells on the slides were then incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-Stat1 or anti-SHP-2 polyclonal antibody for 60 min. After three PBS washes, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody for an additional 45 min and examined with a fluorescence microscope. For protein-DNA binding analysis, cell lysates were incubated with 10 μg of SIE-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at room temperature. Following precipitation by mild centrifugation, SIE-bead precipitates were washed extensively with lysis buffer. SIE bead-precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting with anti-Stat1 antibody. Nuclear lysates prepared from A431 cells (10 μg) were also incubated with 1 ng of 32P-labeled M67SIE double-strand oligonucleotide for 10 min and analyzed on an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) gel as described previously (17Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Google Scholar). For the Stat1-dependent reporter assay, 293T cells were plated in 6-well dishes with 50% confluence the day before transfection. The following day the cells were fed with fresh medium and were transfected using LipofectAMINE according to the commercial protocol. Transfection included the effector expression plasmid (i.e. SHP-2) and the reporter plasmid, i.e.2xM67SIE-Luc, which had two repeats of the Stat1 site (M67SIE) (16Wang Y.J. Wu T.R. Cai S.Y. Welte T. Chin Y.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4505-4512Google Scholar). After 24 h, the cells received 5 ng/ml IFNγ treatment. After an additional 6 h, the cells were harvested in PBS and lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega). The lysates were assayed for luciferase activity using an OPTOCOMP I Luminometer. To evaluate the process of STAT protein dephosphorylationin vivo, we first treated A431 cells with EGF and IFNγ for different periods, and activated Stat1 proteins were immunoprecipitated using antibodies recognizing [Tyr(P)701]Stat1 and [Ser(P)727]Stat1, respectively. As shown in Fig.1 A, both EGF and IFNγ induced rapid Stat1 phosphorylation on both Tyr701 and Ser727 residues. Twenty-four hours later, tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 was still detectable in the cells treated with IFNγ, but completely disappeared in the cells treated with EGF. Under the same conditions, serine dephosphorylation at Ser(P)727 was slower compared with tyrosine dephosphorylation at Tyr(P)701 residue (Fig. 1 A,middle panel). Since tyrosine phosphorylation is crucial for STAT-DNA complex formation, we examined STAT DNA binding activity in response to EGF and IFNγ. As expected, in A431 cells both EGF and IFNγ quickly induced STAT-DNA complex formation in gel shift assay by using 32P-labeled M67SIE oligonucleotide as the probe (Fig.1 B). This is consistent with the Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation pattern observed in Fig. 1 A, where an IFNγ-induced Stat1-DNA complex formation (SIF) was detectable even 24 h later. In contrast to this, EGF-induced Stat1-DNA complex was relatively transient. These data indicate that EGF and IFNγ lead to the differential Stat1 phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. To identify the protein phosphatase(s) responsible for STAT dephosphorylation, we designed an antibody array by immobilizing various polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against different protein phosphatases and some inhibitors of the JAK-STAT pathway on a PVDF membrane (16Wang Y.J. Wu T.R. Cai S.Y. Welte T. Chin Y.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4505-4512Google Scholar). Untreated or EGF-treated A431 cell lysates were incubated with these prepared antibody arrays for 1 h followed by anti-Stat1 immunoblotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 C, positive signals were detected in several positions immobilized with antibodies against protein phosphatases including PAC1 (6b) and SHP-2 (4e), suggesting a possible interaction between Stat1 and these protein phosphatases in A431 cells. Relative weak signals detected in the arrays include PTP1B (7b), VHR (2C), PTEN (7d), and SOCS6 (4d). However, it appeared that SHP-2 and Stat1 association observed at position 4e of Fig. 1 C was EGF-dependent. To confirm the EGF-dependent Stat1-SHP-2 interaction detected with antibody array screening, coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays were performed. Although a basal interaction between Stat1 and SHP-2 was detected in the lysates of A431 cells, the interaction between these two proteins was greatly enhanced in the lysates prepared from the cells receiving both EGF and IFNγ treatments, and was most striking with EGF treatment (Fig. 1 D). Thus, SHP-2 may effect Stat1 proteins by direct interaction with them in cells. To assess the location where SHP-2 interacts with Stat1, we examined the subcellular localization in cells. A431 cells were probed with Stat1- and SHP-2-specific IgG, respectively, in immunofluorescence experiments. Both EGF- and IFNγ-mediated Stat1 nuclear translocations were immediately observed (Fig.2 A). SHP-2 distributed in both nuclei and cytoplasm prior to stimulation. Anti-SHP-2 antibody stain the nuclei intensely in both EGF- and IFNγ-treated cells, although some punctuate cytoplasmic staining could also be seen (Fig.2 A). We then evaluated the kinetics of these two proteins in nuclear translocation. EGF treatment increased both SHP-2 and Stat1 steady nuclear migration within a period of 30 min to 6 h (Fig.2 B). SHP-2 nuclear translocation time course has been repeated at least three times, and about a 2–3-fold increase of SHP-2 level in nuclei was detected after EGF treatment for 6 h. Whereas nuclear phospho-Stat1 was stable for at least 6 h, the SHP-2 nuclear level was steadily increased up to 3 h but restored to the basal level after 6 h of treatment (Fig. 2 C). In the Stat1-deficient cell line U3A SHP-2 nuclear localization was detected that was not dependent on IFNγ-treatment (data not shown). Consistently, more Stat1/SHP-2 protein complexes were detected in the nuclear fraction of EGF-treated than that of IFNγ-treated A431 cells (Fig. 2 D, top panel). Both EGFR and Jak1 were recovered from SHP-2 immunoprecipitates in the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 2 D, middle panels). Another JAK family member Jak2 was not found to associate with SHP-2 (data not shown). Although SHP-2 can block STAT activation via inhibiting JAK activity in cytoplasm as reported previously (14You M. Yu D-H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2416-2424Google Scholar), the above results indicate that SHP-2 may directly affect Stat1 activity in nuclei. To characterize the domains of SHP-2 and Stat1 involved in their direct interaction, we generated a number of GST recombinant fusion proteins of SHP-2 either full-length or with different functional domains as indicated in Fig.3 A. Equal amounts of different GST-SHP-2 fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with A431 whole cell lysates, and proteins interacting with the GST fusion proteins analyzed by anti-Stat1 immunoblotting assay. As shown in Fig. 3 A, GST-PTP, GST-SH2N-PTP, and GST-SHP-2 of full-length, containing the C-terminal region (residues 217–593), could pull-down Stat1. The N-terminal region of SHP-2 (residues 1–220) comprising 2 tandem SH2 domains is important for both protein-protein interaction and C-terminal PTP regulatory actions (21Eck M.J. Pluskey S. Trub T. Harrison S.C. Shoelson S.E. Nature. 1996; 379: 277-280Google Scholar, 22Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Google Scholar, 23Jiao H. Berrada K. Yang W. Tabrizi M. Platanias L.C. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6985-6992Google Scholar). However, our results revealed that neither these individual SH2 domains alone, nor these two SH2 domains together (GST-SH2NC, residues 1–220) was able to precipitate Stat1 (Fig. 3 A). A weak signal was visible after extended exposure time, indicating that a weak interaction between Stat1 and SH2C-SH2N domain of SHP-2 occurred. These data indicate that the SHP-2 C-terminal catalytic domain (PTP) mediates its interaction with Stat1. We next sought to delineate the region(s) of Stat1 important for its interaction with SHP-2. This was accomplished using [His6]Stat1 in full-length or truncated forms as indicated in Fig. 3 B. These His6 recombinant Stat1 proteins were incubated with A431 cell extracts followed by SHP-2 antibody immunoprecipitation. SHP-2 immunoprecipitates were subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-His6 antibody. Results in Fig. 3 B showed that full-length [His6]Stat1 (His-Stat1), the C-terminal region of [His6]Stat1 (His-C-Stat1, residues 468–750), and the SH2-TA domain of [His6]Stat1 (His-SH2TA, residues 577–750) all pulled-down SHP-2. No significant amount of His6-N-Stat1 representing the relatively conserved N-terminal region of Stat1 (residues 1–467) was present in the SHP-2 precipitate (Fig. 3 B). SHP-2 was shown to interact with JAK and other cellular components (24Yin T. Shen R. Feng G.S. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1032-1037Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the interaction between the C-regions of these two proteins revealed in Fig. 3, A and Bwas a direct interaction or was mediated by docking proteins such as JAKs, we performed an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay. Bacterially expressed [His6]Stat1, His6-C-Stat1, and His6-Stat1-SH2-TA recombinants were incubated with GST, GST-PTP, and full-length GST-SHP-2 followed by immunoanalysis with anti-Stat1. As shown in Fig.3 C, all the three forms of [His6]Stat1 could form complexes with both full-length GST-SHP-2 and GST-PTP, but not with GST. Consistent with the results in Fig. 3, A andB, the interaction between His-Stat1 N-region and GST-PTP or full-length GST-SHP-2 was not detected (Fig. 3 C, right panel). The importance of different motifs of Stat1 in interaction with SHP-2 was then examined in 293T transfectants. Stat1 with Y701F, S727A, or DBD (E428E429AA) mutation could still interact with SHP-2 (Fig. 3 D). Stat1 with a deletion mutation from Ser316 to Ser606 was constructed, with which the whole linker domain (residues Thr489–Gly576), the critical motif (Glu428-Glu429) of the DNA binding domain (residues Phe318–Leu488), and the essential part of the SH2 domain (SH2 starts from Cys577) were removed. As can be seen clearly in Fig 3 D, this short form of Stat1 still interacted with SHP-2. These in vivo findings were consistent with the in vitro studies that Stat1 and SHP-2 interaction occurred directly within their C-terminal domains, irrelevant to their SH2 domains. A direct interaction between the SHP-2 catalytic domain (C-region) and Stat1 C-region containing both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine residues required for transcription activity strongly suggests that SHP-2 can directly dephosphorylate Stat1. To determine whether SHP-2 dephosphorylates Stat1, IFNγ-induced Stat1 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation was evaluated in SHP-2−/− and control fibroblasts. Fig.4 A shows a time course of Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IFNγ treatment in these cells. As expected, in SHP-2−/− cells, Stat1 dephosphorylation was greatly postponed or reduced (Fig. 4 A). To terminate tyrosine kinase activity, the cells were incubated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein for an additional 30 min before harvest. IFNγ-triggered Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation in nuclei was greatly enhanced and prolonged in SHP-2−/− fibroblasts. In contrast to this, IFNγ only induced a transient Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation in the wild type cells. These results agreed with a previous observation (14You M. Yu D-H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2416-2424Google Scholar). Similarly, Stat1 serine phosphorylation at Ser727 by IFNγ was also greatly enhanced and prolonged in SHP-2−/− fibroblasts (Fig.4 A). As expected, Stat1 tyrosine and serine phosphorylations were much weaker in SHP-2-reintroduced SHP-2−/− cells (Fig.4 A). To further confirm a direct role of SHP-2 on Stat1 dephosphorylation, SHP-2−/− and control cells were treated with IFNγ for 2 h, and then kinase activity was halted by adding the kinase inhibitor genistein. Phospho-Stat1 level was quite stable for 3 h and was only weakly reduced after 6 h in SHP-2−/− cells. In control cells, phospho-Stat1 was about the same for the first hour after genistein treatment. However, after an additional hour or so, phospho-Stat1 level decreased by at least one-half, and the signal disappeared almost completely within 6 h of genistein treatment (Fig. 4 B). We then compared Stat1 DNA binding activity in SHP-2−/− with control fibroblasts. Cell lysates prepared from these fibroblasts were incubated with SIE-agarose beads. Stat1 precipitation by SIE oligonucleotides was then confirmed in immunoblotting. As expected, in SHP-2−/− cells, Stat1 DNA binding activity was greatly enhanced and prolonged (Fig. 4 C), whereas in control cells, Stat1 DNA binding activity was transiently induced by IFNγ. Published work showed already that in these mutant cells reconstituted with wild type SHP-2, STAT activation by IFN was no longer enhanced or prolonged (14You M. Yu D-H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2416-2424Google Scholar). These results indicate that SHP-2 specifically affects Stat1 protein phosphorylation in cells at both tyrosine and serine residues. Elevated Jak1 tyrosine phosphorylation in this SHP-2 mutant cell line has been previously reported (14You M. Yu D-H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2416-2424Google Scholar). The augmented and prolonged Stat1 activation observed here could be the consequence of enhanced Jak1 activity. We fractionated the cytosolic and nuclear lysates from the SHP-2−/− embryonic fibroblasts treated with IFNγ for different times. As shown in Fig. 4 D, constitutively phosphorylated Jak1 was detected in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions. As expected, Jak1 phosphorylation in response to IFNγ treatment for 30 min was enhanced in the cytosol fraction. IFNγ-induce"

As part of a strategy to identify all genes expressed in human EC, a full-length cDNA encoding a potential secreted protein harboring 10 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and one CUB domain at the carboxyl terminus (termed, SCUBE1 for Signal peptide-CUB-EGF-like domain containing protein1) was identified. SCUBE1 shares homology with several protein families, including members of the fibrillin and Notch families, and the anticoagulant proteins, thrombomodulin and protein C. SCUBE1 mRNA is found in several highly vascularized tissues such as liver, kidney, lung, spleen, and brain and is selectively expressed in EC by in situ hybridization. SCUBE1 is a secreted glycoprotein that can form oligomers and manifests a stable association with the cell surface. A second gene encoding a homologue (designated SCUBE2) was also identified and is expressed in EC as well as other cell types. SCUBE2 is also a cell-surface protein and can form a heteromeric complex with SCUBE1. Both SCUBE1 and SCUBE2 are rapidly down-regulated in EC after interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α treatment in vitro and after lipopolysaccharide injection in vivo. Thus, SCUBE1 and SCUBE2 define an emerging family of human secreted proteins that are expressed in vascular endothelium and may play important roles in development, inflammation, and thrombosis.

The functional phenotype of EC is dynamically responsive to a variety of physiologic and pathophysiologic stimuli that include proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, bacterial products, as well as biomechanical forces (2Topper J.N.

For example, tissue factor expressed on the surface of EC in response to activation serves as a cofactor for factor VIIa to activate factor X and factor IX in the coagulation cascade (4Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).

To begin to understand the repertoire of human EC surface molecules, we have combined comprehensive library sequencing with transcriptional profiling to identify EC-selective genes (12Yang R.B. Tomlinson J.E. Conley P.B. Hart M.J. Komuves L.G. Ziman M. Lum P.Y. Roberts C. Topper J.N. Physiologist. 2002; 45: 76Google Scholar). Approximately 100,000 cDNA fragments derived from EC were sequenced, and these sequences were then merged with public data bases to obtain ∼10,000 independent gene assemblies putatively expressed in EC. To validate their endothelial expression, these genes were then represented on customized oligonucleotide microarrays (13Hughes T.R. Mao M. Jones A.R. Burchard J. Marton M.J. Shannon K.W. Lefkowitz S.M. Ziman M. Schelter J.M. Meyer M.R. Kobayashi S. Davis C. Dai H. He Y.D. Stephaniants S.B. Cavet G. Walker W.L. West A. Coffey E. Shoemaker D.D. Stoughton R. Blanchard A.P. Friend S.H. Linsley P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar), together with all of the non-redundant human genes from public data bases (12Yang R.B. Tomlinson J.E. Conley P.B. Hart M.J. Komuves L.G. Ziman M. Lum P.Y. Roberts C. Topper J.N. Physiologist. 2002; 45: 76Google Scholar). Competitive hybridizations were performed utilizing both endothelial and non-endothelial cell types, and these analyses revealed ∼400 genes that were uniquely expressed in EC. These included the majority of genes known to be expressed in an EC-selective pattern, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme, acetylated low density lipoprotein receptor, E-selectin, Tie-2, VEGFR2 (KDR), von Willebrand factor, NOS3, CD31, endothelin, VE-cadherin, EphB4, and ephrin-B2, and many uncharacterized genes. One full-length cDNA identified by these approaches encoded a potential secreted protein harboring a signal peptide at the amino terminus followed by 10 EGF-like repeats and 1 CUB domain at the carboxyl terminus (termed SCUBE1 for Signal peptide-CUB- EGF-like domain containing protein1). Interestingly, when overexpressed, SCUBE1 protein is not only secreted but is also tethered on the cell surface. Likewise, a second human gene encoding a homologue (designated SCUBE2) was also identified and appears to be expressed in EC and displayed onto cell surface in overexpressing 293T cells. SCUBE1 and SCUBE2, when singly or coexpressed, can manifest homo- and heterotypic interactions. Furthermore, SCUBE1 and SCUBE2 expression is down-regulated in EC after IL-1β and TNF-α treatment in vitro and after LPS injection in vivo, suggesting a possible role of the SCUBE gene family in the inflammatory response. Previous work has described the apparent mouse homologues of Scube1 andScube2 (14Grimmond S. Larder R. Van Hateren N. Siggers P. Hulsebos T.J. Arkell R. Greenfield A. Genomics. 2000; 70: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Grimmond S. Larder R. Van Hateren N. Siggers P. Morse S. Hacker T. Arkell R. Greenfield A. Mech. Dev. 2001; 102: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Based solely on their expression in a variety of embryonic tissues, it was proposed that the Scubegene family may play roles in development; however, no adult expression data were reported. Our results indicate that SCUBE1 and SCUBE2 define an emerging secreted and cell-surface protein family that is expressed in human vascular endothelium. The details of tissue preparation andin situ hybridization have been described earlier (16Komuves L.G. Hanley K. Lefebvre A.M. Man M.Q. Ng D.C. Bikle D.D. Williams M.L. Elias P.M. Auwerx J.

Following the manufacturer's protocol, digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense riboprobes were synthesized from DNA templates (nucleotides 2241–2529) using reagents supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Sectioning, pretreatment of the sections, and hybridization of the probes were done under strict RNase-free conditions. All reagents were prepared using diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated distilled water. 15-μm thick sections were collected on positively charged slides and dried at 55 °C overnight. The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated in Histosolve and ethanol and rinsed in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated distilled water. The sections were treated at room temperature with 0.2n HCl (20 min), 1.5% H2O2 (15 min), 0.3% Triton X-100 (15 min) followed by proteinase K treatment at 37 °C (30 min). The sections then were washed with triethanolamine buffer followed by acetylation with acetic anhydride. Following prehybridization in 2× SSC, containing 50% formamide at 37 °C (1 h), the sections were air-dried at room temperature. Sections were hybridized with the probes diluted in hybridization solution (2× SSC, containing 50% formamide, 10× Denhardt's, 0.001% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.005% sodium pyrophosphate, and 500 μg/ml yeast tRNA) at 55 °C overnight. Following hybridization, the sections were washed with 4× SSC (twice for 15 min) and 2× SSC (twice for 15 min). The sections then were treated with RNase A at 37 °C (30 min) followed by stringency washes in 2× SSC at 37 °C (15 min), 0.1× SSC at 42 °C (40 min), and finally in 0.1× SSC at room temperature (twice for 15 min). The sections were washed with maleate buffer (30 min) and then blocked with 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 500 mm NaCl, 4% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% cold-water fish skin gelatin, and 0.05% Tween 20. The sections were then incubated with anti-digoxigenin antibody, conjugated to peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), for 1 h. The signal was amplified using TSA-Plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the signal was detected with Vector Blue substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Following incubation with substrate the sections were dehydrated in ethanol and Histosolve and coverslipped. Hybridization with the sense control probe did not result in detectable signal, indicating the specificity of hybridization. Slides were observed with an Olympus BX50 microscope (Olympus, Inc., Melville, NY), using DIC illumination. The microscope was equipped with a Nikon DXM1200 digital camera (Technical Instruments, San Francisco, Burlingame, CA). Digitized images (1280 × 1024-pixel resolution) were acquired using ACT-1 software (Nikon, Melville, NY). Images were resized, cropped, and assembled using Photoshop version 6.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Apart from equalizing the background intensities, no other digital modifications of the original digital images were carried out. To capture the diverse repertoire of genes expressed in EC, multiple libraries from EC under various stimuli (such as shear-stressed, proinflammatory cytokine-treated) were generated and normalized using methods described previously (19Shimkets R.A. Lowe D.G. Tai J.T. Sehl P. Jin H. Yang R. Predki P.F. Rothberg B.E. Murtha M.T. Roth M.E. Shenoy S.G. Windemuth A. Simpson J.W. Simons J.F. Daley M.P. Gold S.A. McKenna M.P. Hillan K. Went G.T.

Approximately 100,000 cDNA fragments were sequenced, and these sequences were then merged with public data bases to obtain ∼10,000 EC gene independent assemblies. To validate their endothelial expression, these genes were then represented on custom oligonucleotide microarrays (13Hughes T.R. Mao M. Jones A.R. Burchard J. Marton M.J. Shannon K.W. Lefkowitz S.M.

Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar), together with all of non-overlapping human genes from public data bases (12Yang R.B. Tomlinson J.E. Conley P.B. Hart M.J. Komuves L.G. Ziman M. Lum P.Y. Roberts C. Topper J.N. Physiologist. 2002; 45: 76Google Scholar). Competitive hybridizations were performed among both endothelial and non-endothelial cells. Clustering analyses revealed ∼400 genes that were uniquely expressed in EC. One cDNA fragment encoding multiple copies of EGF-like domains was identified and subsequently mapped onto human chromosome 22q13. Based on gene prediction, two oligonucleotides (5′-CAG CGG GGC CCG CAT TGA GCA TGG GCG CGG-3′ and 5′-CCC GGT TAT TTG TAG GGC CGC AGG AAC CGA-3′) were used to amplify the entire open reading frame by PCR from a mixture of human cDNA libraries. The amplified SCUBE1 full-length cDNA was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing. The clone containing full-length SCUBE2 was obtained from OriGene Technologies (Rockville, MD). Full-length sequences for SCUBE1 were deposited into GenBankTM with accession number AF525689, and the SCUBE2 sequence is the same as NM_020974 (except nucleotides 1287 to 1526 are spliced out in the clone we used). The human Northern blot was purchased from Clontech and hybridized with a radiolabeled human SCUBE1 cDNA probe (nucleotides 2077–2851) per the manufacturer's protocol. The epitope-tagged versions of SCUBE1 or SCUBE2 were constructed in the following expression vectors. The pcDNA4/Myc-His (Invitrogen) was used to add a Myc tag to the carboxyl terminus of SCUBE1 containing endogenous signal peptide. The pSecTag2 (Invitrogen) including Ig κ-chain leader sequence was used to add a Myc tag at the carboxyl terminus of SCUBE2. The pFLAG-CMV-1 (Sigma) was used to include a FLAG tag at the amino terminus of target protein. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates overnight before transfection. The transfection was performed by using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The total amount of DNA was kept constant in all transfections by supplementing empty vector DNA. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured as described previously (20DiChiara M.R. Kiely J.M. Gimbrone M.A. Lee M.E. Perrella M.A. Topper J.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were washed once with PBS and lysed for 15 min on ice in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 × g. Cells lysates were incubated with 1 μg of indicated antibody and 20 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A-agarose (Pierce) for 2 h with gentle rocking. After three washes with lysis buffer, precipitated complexes were solubilized by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with PBS, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% gelatin and 0.05% Tween 20 and were blotted with the indicated antibodies. After two washes, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (The Jackson Laboratories) for 1 h. After washing the membranes, the reactive bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Transfected cells were washed with PBS and lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA). After incubation for 30 min on ice, cells were homogenized with 80 strokes in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. The lysed cells were then centrifuged at 1,000 × g (30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant taken and further centrifuged at 100,000 × g (30 min, 4 °C) to obtain the cytosolic (S100) and membrane (P100) fractions. The P100 fraction was washed once with hypotonic lysis buffer, resuspended in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 12, sonicated briefly, and then incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 30 min to give washed fractions S100′ and pellets P100′. Transfected cells were collected and suspended in PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin in a volume of 0.25 ml. A total of 1 μg of purified anti-FLAG M2 antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was added sequentially; each were incubated for 45 min on ice. FACS analyses were performed with a FACScan (BD Biosciences). LPS (Escherichia coli serotype O111:B4) was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in PBS at concentration of 1 mg/ml. LPS solution (5 mg/kg) or PBS was injected intraperitoneally into a group of three C67BL/6 mice, and at the indicated time points (3, 6, 24, and 48 h post-injection), the kidneys of these animals were harvested, washed in sterile cold PBS, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells or harvested animal kidneys using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was prepared on 5 μg of total RNA. One-tenth of the first-strand cDNA reaction was used for each PCR as template. Alternatively, premade first-strand cDNAs from human tissues (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were used as PCR template. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR primers specific for human SCUBE1 and SCUBE2 were as follows: SCUBE1-f2, AGT GTT CTC CAG GCT TCT TCT; SCUBE1-r2, CAG TGC TGG TTT TTG CAG TGT; SCUBE2-f2, AGA CCC CAG AAG CTT GGA ATA; SCUBE2-r2, TCC CCT CCA CAT CTT CTG TTT. GAPDH primers were obtained from Clontech. Real time TaqMan PCR analyses were performed using Applied Biosystems PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System. Normalization was performed using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels as controls in parallel TaqMan reactions. The 5′ and 3′ primers and a fluorescence-labeled probe were designed as follows: SCUBE1 5′ primer, AAC ACA CGG GTA CCG CCT CTT; SCUBE1 3′ primer, GTA TTG TAG TGG TGT CCG GGA GA; SCUBE1 probe, CCA GGA CTG CGA GGC CAA AGT GCA T; SCUBE2 5′ primer, CAG GAT TGT GAA ACC CGA GTT C; SCUBE2 3′ primer, CGG ATA CAT CGG TGT GTG GTG; SCUBE2 probe, TGC TCG CCT GGG CAT TTC TAC AAC A; GAPDH primer-probe was purchased from BioSource International (Camarillo, CA). The endothelial origin of a SCUBE1 cDNA fragment identified by genomic approaches was confirmed by in situ hybridization (Fig.1). It was expressed in the luminal endothelial cells of the human umbilical vessels (Fig. 1 a). Furthermore, localization of this gene to ECs was validated in cynomolgus monkey brain (Fig. 1 b), lung (Fig. 1,c and d), and kidney (Fig. 1, e andf). In addition to endothelial expression in artery and vein, this gene is also expressed in microvascular endothelial cells in a variety of tissues (Fig. 1, b–f, and data not shown). To obtain the full-length cDNA of this gene, the original cDNA fragment was mapped to human genomic sequence (www.ensembl.org) and was found to be localized on chromosome 22q13, where a human gene was predicted based on its homology to mouse Scube1 (14Grimmond S. Larder R. Van Hateren N. Siggers P. Hulsebos T.J. Arkell R. Greenfield A. Genomics. 2000; 70: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides, based on this gene prediction, were used to amplify the entire open reading frame from human cDNAs. This cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2964 nucleotides and encodes a polypeptide of 988 amino acids (Fig.2 a). Hydropathy (21Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16895) Google Scholar) and protein family analyses (22Sonnhammer E.L. Eddy S.R. Durbin R. Proteins. 1997; 28: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar) predict one amino-terminal signal peptide (22 amino acids) followed by 10 EGF-like repeats and a CUB domain (Fig.2). There is an apparent spacer region located between the 9th and 10th EGF-like repeats (Fig. 2 b). This domain structure is identical to that of mouse Scube1, therefore, this human orthologue was designated SCUBE1 to be consistent with the literature (14Grimmond S. Larder R. Van Hateren N. Siggers P. Hulsebos T.J. Arkell R. Greenfield A. Genomics. 2000; 70: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mature SCUBE1 is predicted to contain 966 amino acids with calculated molecular mass of 106 kDa. A Northern blot containing poly(A)+-enriched mRNA (2 μg) from a variety of human adult tissues was hybridized with a human SCUBE1 cDNA radiolabeled probe. The expression level of the SCUBE1 transcripts was highest in liver, kidney, lung, and small intestine, followed by brain, colon, and spleen. The expression in remaining tissues was very low or undetectable (Fig.3). Expression of SCUBE1 in several highly vascular tissues, such as liver, kidney, and lung, is consistent with the endothelial origin of SCUBE1 demonstrated by in situ hybridization (Fig. 1). The size of the primary transcript for SCUBE1 (4 kb) is consistent with both the predicted and cloned full-length cDNA (Fig. 2). Because human SCUBE1 protein has a putative signal peptide at the amino terminus and because human SCUBE1 protein contains 10 EGF-like repeats that are found in many extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) (23Prigent S.A. Lemoine N.R. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 4: 1-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 24Davis C.G. New Biol. 1990; 2: 410-419PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether the SCUBE1 protein is a secretory and/or ECM protein. For this purpose, recombinant SCUBE1 protein was expressed by means of transient expression in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. The Myc epitope tag was added at the carboxyl terminus for the detection of the recombinant protein. Two days after transfection, the culture supernatants were collected, and cells were detached from dishes by EDTA treatment, and residual ECM proteins were extracted with Laemmli buffer. Samples collected from these three fractions were subjected to Western blot analyses using anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig.4 a, human SCUBE1 protein was detected in the conditioned cell culture medium (Medium) and in cells (Cell) but was not detected in the ECM fraction (Matrix) or in fractions from the control vector-transfected cells. These data demonstrate that the SCUBE1 protein is a secreted and cell-associated protein. Because the CUB domain was recently described in two novel members of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family that require proteolytic activation (25Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), we tested whether secreted SCUBE1 could be subject to proteolytic cleavage. A dual epitope-tagged SCUBE1 with FLAG and Myc tags added to the amino and carboxyl terminus, respectively, was transiently expressed in 293T cells. Forty eight hours post-transfection, samples from conditioned medium, cells, and ECM were individually immunoblotted with anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4 b, the molecular weight of detected SCUBE1 protein is identical either by anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies. These results suggest that the secreted SCUBE1 protein does not undergo further proteolytic processing. Consistent with this finding, the dual-tagged SCUBE1 protein immunoprecipitated by FLAG antibody from cell culture conditioned medium (Medium) showed the identical molecular size when blotted either with anti-FLAG or Myc antibodies separately (Fig. 4 c). The molecular size of expressed SCUBE1 in 293T cells is about 130 kDa, slightly larger than the predicted size of the full-length SCUBE1 protein. Because human SCUBE1 possesses six putative N-linked glycosylation motifs (Fig. 2 a), we hypothesized that SCUBE1 is subject to post-translational modification by glycosylation. Thus, we examined whether tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, affected the molecular size of the protein. As shown in Fig.5, tunicamycin treatment of cells resulted in a reduction in the molecular size of the precursor form of the SCUBE1 protein (lanes 2 and 5), indicating that the majority of SCUBE1 is glycosylated when expressed in 293T cells. To determine the contribution of the six putativeN-linked glycosylation sites in the SCUBE1 protein, we compared the molecular size of the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants (D1 and D2) with or without tunicamycin treatment. As shown in Fig. 5, the precursor form of mutant D1 (in which the carboxyl-terminal CUB domain is deleted) was detected at 110 kDa without tunicamycin (lane 3), whereas the protein size was shifted to a faster migrating band by treatment with tunicamycin (lane 6), indicating that the mutant D1 is glycosylated. However, tunicamycin treatment did not change the apparent molecular size of the precursor form of mutant D2 (lanes 4 and 7) (in which five of six putative N-linked glycosylation motifs in the protein are deleted) (Fig. 2 b). Taken together, these data demonstrated that SCUBE1 is N-glycosylated at multiple sites within the carboxyl-terminal region. Because families of secreted growth factors or cytokines are often capable of forming dimeric or higher ordered complexes (29Davies D.R. Wlodawer A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Sun P.D. Davies D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 269-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and because SCUBE1 is a secretory protein, we hypothesized that oligomeric forms of SCUBE1 protein may exist. We constructed cDNAs encoding FLAG- or Myc-tagged SCUBE1 proteins, and we examined their association by co-immunoprecipitation assays from both singly and co-transfected 293T cells (Fig. 6 a).

https://openalex.org/W2042965761,"The calcium-independent receptor of α-latrotoxin (CIRL), a neuronal cell surface receptor implicated in the regulation of exocytosis, is a natural chimera of the cell adhesion protein and the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). In contrast with canonic GPCRs, CIRL consists of two heterologous non-covalently bound subunits, p120 and p85, due to endogenous proteolytic processing of the receptor precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum. Extracellularly oriented p120 contains hydrophilic cell adhesion domains, whereas p85 resembles a generic GPCR. We determined that the site of the CIRL cleavage is located within a juxtamembrane Cys- and Trp-rich domain of the N-terminal extracellular region of CIRL. Mutations in this domain make CIRL resistant to the cleavage and impair its trafficking. Therefore, we have named it GPS for G protein-coupled receptor proteolysis site. The GPS motif is found in homologous adhesion GPCRs and thus defines a novel receptor family. We postulate that the proteolytic processing and two-subunit structure is a common characteristic feature in the family of GPS-containing adhesion GPCRs."

Whereas a kinase that uses PtdIns-5-P as an intracellular substrate has been assigned, a kinase that produces it remained to be identified. Here we report that PIKfyve, the enzyme found to synthesize PtdIns-5-P in vitroand PtdIns-3,5-P2 in vitro and in vivo, is responsible for PtdIns-5-P production in a cellular context. Evidence is based on examination of two groups of cell types by two independent approaches. First, [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells (Sf9, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes) that show a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-detectable peak of the PtdIns-5-P head group at basal conditions demonstrated a 20–50% increase in radioactive PtdIns-5-P amounts upon expression of PIKfyveWT. Second, cell types (HEK293), in which the basal levels of radioactive PtdIns-5-P were undetectable by HPLC head group analysis, demonstrated higher in vitro type II PIP kinase-directed conversion of the endogenous PtdIns-5-P pool into PtdIns-4,5-P2, when induced to express PIKfyveWT. Conversely, a decrease by 60% in the conversion of PtdIns-5-P to PtdIns-4,5-P2 was associated with induced expression of the dominant-negative kinase-deficient PIKfyveK1831E mutant in HEK293 cells. When 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were subjected to osmotic shock, levels of PtdIns-5-P measured by both approaches were found to decrease profoundly upon a hypo-osmotic stimulus. Together, these results identify PIKfyve as an enzyme responsible for PtdIns-5-P biosynthesis and indicate a role for PtdIns-5-P in osmotic response pathways in mammalian cells. The cellular functions, regulation and enzymology of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 5-P, the newest addition to the family of phosphoinositides (PI), are still elusive.

When 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were subjected to osmotic shock, levels of PtdIns-5-P measured by both approaches were found to decrease profoundly upon a hypo-osmotic stimulus. Together, these results identify PIKfyve as an enzyme responsible for PtdIns-5-P biosynthesis and indicate a role for PtdIns-5-P in osmotic response pathways in mammalian cells. It is now well recognized that dynamic changes in the phosphorylation status of intracellular phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; GroPIns, glycerophosphorylinositol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PI, phosphoinositide; K, kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; P, phosphate; P2, bisphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HEK, human embryonic kidney 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; GroPIns, glycerophosphorylinositol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PI, phosphoinositide; K, kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; P, phosphate; P2, bisphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HEK, human embryonic kidney regulate diverse cellular processes such as cell signaling, membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal reorganization, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle. In mammalian cells, a wide spectrum of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases produce seven phosphorylated metabolites of PtdIns, known so far, i.e. PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-4-P, PtdIns-5-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, PtdIns-3,5-P2, PtdIns-4,5-P2, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Fruman D.A.

In most cases, phosphorylated metabolites of PtdIns, collectively called PIs, were found to serve as regulatory membrane-localized signals that recruit/activate protein effectors when their downstream function is required. Downstream proteins recognize PI signals through PI-specific binding domains, including the pleckstrin homology domain and several newly identified modules such as the FYVE finger (from the first letters of Fab1p, YOTB, Vac1p, and EEA1), the FERM (Four-point-one-Ezrin-Radaxin-Moesin), the ENTH (Epsin N-terminal Homology), and the PX (Phox homology) domains (for recent reviews see Refs. 9Corvera S.

Cell. 2001; 105: 817-820Google Scholar).Given the pleiotropic functions of PIs, it is apparent that the kinases and phosphatases responsible for their synthesis and turnover play an essential role in cell regulation. Whereas the phosphatases and their contribution to the interconversion of the PIs are less well characterized (6Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Google Scholar, 7Hughes W.E. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 337-352Google Scholar, 8York J.D. Guo S. Odom A.R. Spiegelberg B.R. Stolz L.E. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2001; 41: 57-71Google Scholar), phosphoinositide kinases have been identified for most PIs (1Fruman D.A. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1999; 97: 817-820Google Scholar, 2Anderson R.A. Boronenkov I.V. Doughman S.D. Kunz J. Loijens J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9907-9910Google Scholar, 3Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Google Scholar, 4Vanhaesbroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Google Scholar). Studies with purified mammalian enzymes divide PIKs into a number of classes differing by the phosphorylation of specific hydroxyl groups in the inositol ring: PI 3-Ks, PI 4-Ks, and PI 5-Ks (1Fruman D.A. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1999; 97: 817-820Google Scholar, 2Anderson R.A. Boronenkov I.V. Doughman S.D. Kunz J. Loijens J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9907-9910Google Scholar, 3Toker A. Curr.

Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Google Scholar). PI 3-kinases, which catalyze the phosphorylation at positiond-3 in PtdIns, PtdIns-4-P, PtdIns-4,5-P2, and likely PtdIns-5-P, are further subdivided into three classes,i.e. IA and IB, II, and III, based on their structure, in vitro substrate specificity, and mode of activation. PI 4-Ks are also represented by several types. Some of them display restricted substrate specificity strictly directed toward position d-4 of PtdIns, but not of PIs, and are called PtdIns 4-Ks. Position 4 in d-5-phosphorylated PtdIns, and to a lesser extent, in d-3-phosphorylated PtdIns, can be attacked by the enzymatic activity of another subclass of PI 4-kinases, known as type II PIPKs or PIP 4-Ks. Finally, position 5 can be phosphorylated by two subclasses of enzymes: PI 5-Ks (or type I PIPKs; Ref. 13Tolias K.F. Rameh L.E. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18040-18046Google Scholar) and PIKfyve (Refs. 14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Google Scholar and 15Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 16Shisheva A. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 1201-1206Google Scholar), which display preferences for d-4- andd-3-phosphorylated PtdIns, respectively. Both enzymes are capable of converting PtdIns to PtdIns-5-P in vitro(13Tolias K.F. Rameh L.E. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18040-18046Google Scholar, 14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Google Scholar, 15Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that often the in vitrodetermined substrate specificity does not reflect that in living cells, where factors such as substrate availability, accessibility and presentation, or enzyme regulation may alter the enzyme specificity. This, combined with the fact that each PI (with the exception of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) could be produced by dephosphorylation of higher phosphorylated PIs, indicates that PI biosynthesis and turnover are exceedingly complex.Although studies with purified enzymes revealed PtdIns-5-P synthesis is supported by two enzymes, the kinase(s) responsible for PtdIns-5-P production in a cellular context remained unknown. The identification of this 5-phosphorylatd PtdIns metabolite, the latest addition to the PI family, was somewhat delayed because of its poor chromatographic separation from PtdIns-4-P on HPLC columns (17Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 309: 192-196Google Scholar). Moreover, when detected in mammalian cells, PtdIns-5-P was found to represent only a minor fraction of PIs (17Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 309: 192-196Google Scholar), thus making cellular studies even more problematic. PtdIns-5-P is a substrate for type II PIPKs (17Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 309: 192-196Google Scholar) and, thus far, has been reported to occur naturally in resting mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts in culture (17Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 309: 192-196Google Scholar), human platelets (18Morris J.B. Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Letcher A.J. Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 57-60Google Scholar), andChlamydomonas cells (19Meijer H.J.G. Berrie C.P. Iurisci C. Divecha N. Musgrave A. Munnik T. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 491-498Google Scholar). Negative results were reported in yeast (20Gary J.D. Wurmser A.E. Bonangelino C.J. Weisman L.S. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 65-79Google Scholar, 21McEwen R.K. Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Shisheva A. Ohya Y. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33905-33912Google Scholar), several mammalian cell types in culture (22Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26141-26147Google Scholar), andArabidopsis (23Pical C. Westergren T. Dove S.K. Larsson C. Sommarin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38232-38240Google Scholar). Little is known about the intracellular regulation of PtdIns-5-P. In platelets, levels of PtdIns-5-P have been shown to increase acutely upon thrombin stimulation, whereas inChlamydomonas cells PtdIns-5-P was up-regulated by hyperosmotic stress (18Morris J.B. Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Letcher A.J. Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 57-60Google Scholar, 19Meijer H.J.G. Berrie C.P. Iurisci C. Divecha N. Musgrave A. Munnik T. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 491-498Google Scholar). Clearly, although the natural occurrence of PtdIns-5-P in the higher eukaryotic cells may play an important role in different cellular processes, the intracellular production, regulation of metabolism, and physiological functions of PtdIns-5-P are largely unknown. Therefore, to define the enzyme involved in PtdIns-5-P biosynthesis and a possible regulation of PtdIns-5-P levels, we have examined various cell types, in which accumulated radioactive PtdIns-5-P during [32P]orthophosphate cell labeling is readily detected by HPLC head group analysis. In addition, mammalian cells, previously shown negative for radioactive PtdIns-5-P by HPLC (22Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26141-26147Google Scholar), were examined in vitro for type II PIPK-directed conversion of PtdIns-5-P to PtdIns-4,5-P2. We report here that PIKfyve is responsible for PtdIns-5-P biosynthesis and that the osmoregulatory response in mammalian cells involves a robust change in PtdIns-5-P levels.DISCUSSIONSince the discovery of PtdIns-5-P as a substrate for type II PIPK and its natural occurrence in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (17Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 309: 192-196Google Scholar), studies related to this PtdIns metabolite have been surprisingly sparse. As a result, we know almost nothing about the intracellular synthesis, roles, and regulation of PtdIns-5-P. This lack of information is mainly due to the fact that PtdIns-5-P is only a minor fraction of PIs whose HPLC elution characteristics are very similar to that of the abundant PtdIns-4-P that comprises roughly 30–40% of the PIs. Therefore, the 5-phosphorylated PtdIns metabolite was the last among the seven PIs to be identified and only after the optimization of elution conditions in the HPLC run to allow separation of PtdIns-5-P from PtdIns-4-P (17Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 309: 192-196Google Scholar). When detected, PtdIns-5-P was typically seen as a small peak within the trailing edge of PtdIns-4-P long before the latter reaches the base line (Refs. 13Tolias K.F. Rameh L.E. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18040-18046Google Scholar, 15Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Google Scholar, 17Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 309: 192-196Google Scholar, and this study). Apparently, low amounts of PtdIns-5-P are likely to be hidden within the PtdIns-4-P tail. Recently, an alternative approach for PtdIns-5-P intracellular determination has been based on the substrate preferences of type II PIPK for PtdIns-5-P versus PtdIns-4-P and the effective detection of PtdIns-4,5-P2 by HPLC (18Morris J.B. Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Letcher A.J. Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 57-60Google Scholar). The aim of this study was first to analyze whether the PIKfyve enzyme was responsible for PtdIns-5-P intracellular synthesis and second to examine plausible osmotic shock-related dynamics in PtdIns-5-P intracellular production. To this end, we have applied both available techniques for detection of intracellular PtdIns-5-P, i.e. an HPLC head group separation of radioactive PtdIns-5-P accumulated during cell labeling with [32P]orthophosphate and the type II PIPK-directed conversion of PtdIns-5-P to PtdIns-4,5-P2. Our studies unequivocally demonstrate that higher or lower PtdIns-5-P levels are associated with cell expression of recombinant PIKfyveWT or kinase-deficient PIKfyveK1831E, respectively, providing the first clue for the biosynthetic route of PtdIns-5-P. Furthermore, a robust decrease in PtdIns-5-P cellular production was documented upon hypo-osmotic shock in mouse 3T3-L1 cells implicating PtdIns-5-P as a regulatory intermediate in the osmotic response pathway in mammalian cells.The role of PIKfyve in PtdIns-5-P cellular production has been first suggested by the data demonstrating a powerful ability of a purified PIKfyve protein to support the conversion of PtdIns to PtdIns-5-P (14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Google Scholar,15Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Google Scholar). Subsequent in vivo studies, however, both in yeast and several mammalian cell types heterologously expressing high levels of PIKfyveWT, failed to detect intracellular PtdIns-5-P production (21McEwen R.K. Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Shisheva A. Ohya Y. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33905-33912Google Scholar, 22Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26141-26147Google Scholar). Because an increase of PtdIns-3,5-P2was possible to be documented under these conditions, PIKfyve has been implicated in PtdIns-3,5-P2 but not in PtdIns-5-P biosynthesis. However, the cell types tested so far all showed undetectable accumulation of radioactive PtdIns-5-P at resting conditions in in vivo labeling studies coupled to HPLC head group analysis (21McEwen R.K. Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Shisheva A. Ohya Y. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33905-33912Google Scholar, 22Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26141-26147Google Scholar). This implies that limitations of technical or other nature may have been preventing PtdIns-5-P production and/or detection. Among those, one could envision an upstream regulator(s) of PIKfyve PtdIns-5-P-synthesizing activity, which becomes a limiting factor particularly under conditions of PIKfyve overexpression in certain cells. Recent studies in yeast identifying Vac14 protein as an upstream activator of the yeast PIKfyve ortholog Fab1p lipid kinase (33Bonangelino C.J. Nau J.J. Duex J.E. Brinkman M. Wurmser A.E. Gary J.D. Emr S.D. Weisman L.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1015-1028Google Scholar, 34Dove S.K. McEwen R.K. Mayes A. Hughes D.C. Beggs J.D. Michell R.H. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 885-893Google Scholar) indicate that this assumption may be correct. Another group of limiting factors may include a rapid PtdIns-5-P turnover coupled with uneven specific activity of the [32P]ATP pool during cell labeling and/or unfavorable PtdIns-5-P versus PtdIns-4-P detection under HPLC analysis, discussed above. Overcoming these restrictions was made possible in the present study, at least in part, by applying two strategies. First, usage of cell types in which the accumulation of radioactive PtdIns-5-P peak upon HPLC head group analysis was evident at resting conditions, and second, usage of the PtdIns-5-P enzymatic conversion in cell types with undetectable levels of PtdIns-5-P under HPLC analysis. Both strategies unequivocally demonstrated an increase of PtdIns-5-P production associated with expression of high levels of PIKfyveWT in both mammalian and insect cells, thus establishing the biosynthetic pathway in PtdIns-5-P metabolism. That this pathway is likely physiologically relevant is further substantiated in the present study by the data demonstrating a marked decrease of PtdIns-5-P levels by inducing the expression of the dominant-negative kinase-deficient PIKfyveK1831E mutant. Because PIKfyve is an evolutionarily conserved protein found also in plants (16Shisheva A. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 1201-1206Google Scholar) where a substantial basal PtdIns-5-P production has been recently documented (up to 18% of the PtdIns-4-P amounts; Ref. 19Meijer H.J.G. Berrie C.P. Iurisci C. Divecha N. Musgrave A. Munnik T. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 491-498Google Scholar), we suggest a biosynthetic mechanism that operates due to plant PIKfyve in these cells. It remains to be re-examined by PtdIns-5-P conversion assay whether the reported lack of PtdIns-5-P production in yeast cells (20Gary J.D. Wurmser A.E. Bonangelino C.J. Weisman L.S. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 65-79Google Scholar, 21McEwen R.K. Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Shisheva A. Ohya Y. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33905-33912Google Scholar) is associated with technicalities in detection or truly reflects a more restricted substrate specificity of Fab1p toward 3-phosphorylated PtdIns. In any case, Fab1p is able to convert PtdIns into PtdIns-5-P in vitro (21McEwen R.K. Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Shisheva A. Ohya Y. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33905-33912Google Scholar).One important aspect of the present studies is the observation that the intracellular PIKfyve lipid kinase activity synthesizes two lipid products. Thus, we reproducibly detected a simultaneous increase of both PtdIns-5-P and PtdIns-3,5-P2 production upon transduction of 32P-labeled 3T3-L1 adipocytes with adenovirus encoding PIKfyveWT (22Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26141-26147Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). This was also evident in the HEK293 stable cell line, where we documented higher PtdIns-5-P levels by mass assay (Fig. 3 B) and an increase of the accumulated [32P]PtdIns-3,5-P2 by HPLC analysis ofin vivo labeled cells induced to express PIKfyveWT (Ref. 22Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26141-26147Google Scholar and data not shown). This dual specificity implies that distinct intracellular signals may differentially regulate PIKfyve lipid substrate preferences. Although direct experimental evidence is currently unavailable, the assumption that such differential regulation may operate in the cellular context is supported by our recent observation documenting altered lipid substrate preferences for either PtdIns-3-P or PtdIns upon substitution of Lys-2000 or Lys-1999 in PIKfyve, respectively (35Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Mlak K. Kanzaki M. Pessin J. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9206-9211Google Scholar).A key observation in the present study is the demonstration that PtdIns-5-P synthesis is profoundly decreased upon hypo-osmotic shock in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes. Because these cells showed no hyperosmotically dependent increase in PtdIns-5-P, but a substantially augmented PtdIns-4,5-P2 production, we suspect a concomitant activation of type II PIPK that should be tested in future studies. Whereas reports related to osmotically regulated PtdIns-5-P synthesis in mammalian cells are, to the best of our knowledge, unavailable, a recent study (19Meijer H.J.G. Berrie C.P. Iurisci C. Divecha N. Musgrave A. Munnik T. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 491-498Google Scholar) in Chlamydomonas cells has demonstrated a rapid and sustained increase in PtdIns-5-P upon treatment with 300 mm NaCl for a period of 15 min. Intriguingly, in the same study, the PtdIns-4,5-P2 levels were back to normal at the 15-min time point (19Meijer H.J.G. Berrie C.P. Iurisci C. Divecha N. Musgrave A. Munnik T. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 491-498Google Scholar), suggesting a less efficient type II PIPK-directed conversion of PtdIns-5-P in this cell system. Together, these data are consistent with the concept that acute changes in PtdIns-5-P levels are involved in the cellular osmoregulatory pathway, and this mechanism may be evolutionarily conserved. It is tempting to speculate that PtdIns-5-P, like other PIs, has a direct signaling potential and is able to selectively recruit specific yet-to-be identified protein intermediates with relevance to osmoprotective cell responses. Noteworthy, osmotic shock of 3T3-L1 adipocytes is shown to stimulate the glucose transport activity, translocation of GLUT4, and membrane ruffling. These cellular effects resemble those elicited by insulin, and studies indicate that these two stimuli share both common and unique signaling pathway mechanisms (36Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Google Scholar, 37Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Google Scholar, 38Janez A. Worrall D.S. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26870-26876Google Scholar). It would be interesting in future studies to examine a plausible regulatory role of PtdIns-5-P in the molecular mechanism of osmotic shock- and insulin-induced responses in this cell type. Moreover, dominant-negative kinase-deficient PIKfyveK1831Ehas been shown recently to inhibit insulin-regulated GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (39Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Mlak K. Shisheva A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4742-4754Google Scholar).Our data demonstrating PIKfyve-dependent intracellular PtdIns-5-P production would imply a role for PIKfyve in osmotically regulating PtdIns-5-P levels. Although this assumption may be correct, the complex enzymology of PIs, including that of PtdIns-5-P, precludes us from making such a conclusion. Moreover, there is the unfavorable fact that we were unable to detect sustained osmotically dependent regulation in the in vitro PIKfyve lipid kinase activity. Theoretically, levels of PtdIns-5-P could decrease due to osmotically dependent inhibition of PIKfyve, PtdIns-4,5-P24-phosphatase, and PtdIns-3,5-P2 3-phosphatase activities or activation of type II PIPK and PtdIns-5-P phosphatase. However, no such phosphatases have been clearly described thus far (6Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Google Scholar, 7Hughes W.E. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J.

Also, it should be emphasized that hypo-osmotic shock in 3T3-L1 cells caused a substantial drop in accumulated [32P]PtdIns-3,5-P2 and PtdIns-4,5-P2 amounts corresponding to 2.8- and 1.6-fold, respectively. These results and considerations eliminate the action of the first two hypothetical candidate phosphatases, making PIKfyve a more likely candidate for osmoregulation. Thus, the simultaneous inhibition of PtdIns-5-P and PtdIns-3,5-P2production both associated with the dual lipid kinase activity of PIKfyve is consistent with the idea for a hypo-osmotic down-regulation of PIKfyve activity in vivo, although it remains to be experimentally proven in future studies.In conclusion, we demonstrate here that PIKfyve lipid kinase activity is responsible for biosynthesis of PtdIns-5-P, a lipid whose natural occurrence was identified several years ago but whose kinase remained elusive. The turnover of PtdIns-5-P likely involves further conversion to PtdIns-4,5-P2 by type II PIPK, supporting the previously suggested alternative pathway of PtdIns-4,5-P2biosynthesis. It is also possible that PtdIns-5-P is a precursor for an alternative production of PtdIns-3,5-P2 that would require the specificity of a separate PI 3-kinase. The fact that hypo-osmotic shock of 3T3-L1 cells induces a robust decrease of PtdIns-5-P levels indicates that PtdIns-5-P may be a regulatory intermediate in osmoprotective response pathways in mammalian cells. It is now well recognized that dynamic changes in the phosphorylation status of intracellular phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; GroPIns, glycerophosphorylinositol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PI, phosphoinositide; K, kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; P, phosphate; P2, bisphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HEK, human embryonic kidney 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; GroPIns, glycerophosphorylinositol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PI, phosphoinositide; K, kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; P, phosphate; P2, bisphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HEK, human embryonic kidney regulate diverse cellular processes such as cell signaling, membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal reorganization, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle.

https://openalex.org/W2084202366,"The therapeutic efficacy of tamoxifen (TAM) in cancer therapy is thought to arise primarily from its ability to compete with estrogens for binding to the estrogen receptor (ER). We show that TAM and its active metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), can actively induce programmed cell death through distinct ER-dependent and ER-independent pathways. The ER-independent pathway is activated by 10–20 μmTAM and OHT and by 10–20 μm 17β-estradiol and raloxifene, and occurs in ER-negative cells. The ER dependence of a second pathway, caused by submicromolar concentrations of TAM and OHT, was demonstrated by the ability of the ER ligands 17β-estradiol, raloxifene, and ICI 182,780 to effectively block the cell death-inducing effects of TAM and OHT. Because the p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 blocks OHT·ER-induced cell death, stress kinase pathways are likely involved. ER-independent cell death triggers classic caspase-dependent apoptosis. However, although OHT·ER triggers some hallmarks of apoptosis, including Bax translocation and cytochrome c release, the absence of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage or DNA laddering indicates that the death pathway involved is caspase-independent. The OHT·ER-dependent cell death pathway appears to diverge from classical apoptosis at the level of caspase 9 activation. The ability to promote ER-dependent programmed cell death represents a novel activity of TAM and OHT.

Binding of 17β-estradiol (E2) to the ER induces a conformational change that enables the ER to recruit transcriptional coactivators and to induce expression of estrogen-regulated genes. Several estrogen-inducible genes, including c-myc, TGF-α, and cathepsin D, are implicated in malignant transformation or tumor metastases (1Dubik D. Shiu R.P. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1587-1594Google Scholar, 2Bates S.E. Davidson N.E. Valverius E.M. Freter C.E. Dickson R.B. Tam J.P. Kudlow J.E. Lippman M.E. Salomon D.S. Mol.

Tamoxifen (TAM) and its active metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), are nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) that compete with E2 and other estrogens for binding to ER. Structural studies and chromatin immunoprecipitations show that OHT·ER induces an ER conformation that does not recruit coactivators to target genes and in many cell and promoter contexts recruits corepressors (5Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Google Scholar, 6Shang Y. Brown M. Science. 2002; 295: 2465-2468Google Scholar). The therapeutic effectiveness of TAM in treatment of hormone-dependent cancers and in preventing breast cancer in high risk women is thought to arise primarily from its ability to compete with estrogens for binding to the ER. It is thought that TAM·ER and OHT·ER are unable to effectively activate transcription of genes important for the growth and development of estrogen-dependent tumors. However, several often-conflicting studies show that TAM and OHT can actively induce programmed cell death of cancer cells (reviewed in Ref. 7Mandlekar S. Kong A.N. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 469-477Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which TAM and OHT induce programmed cell death have been quite controversial, with even the identity of the toxic agents in dispute. One group reported that high concentrations of TAM, but not OHT, induce cell death (8Dietze E.C. Caldwell L.E. Grupin S.L. Mancini M. Seewaldt V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5384-5394Google Scholar). Others indicated that both TAM and OHT induce cell death (9Mandlekar S. Hebbar V. Christov K. Kong A.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6601-6606Google Scholar). Although our recent report was consistent with a role for ER in OHT-induced apoptosis (10Zhang C.C. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 479-486Google Scholar), other workers suggest a number of different mechanisms for TAM-induced apoptosis. The effects of TAM might be mediated through an ER-independent increase in reactive oxygen species, resulting in caspase activation (9Mandlekar S. Hebbar V. Christov K. Kong A.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6601-6606Google Scholar, 11Mandlekar S. Yu R. Tan T.H. Kong A.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5995-6000Google Scholar), or through an influx of extracellular calcium (12Kim J.A.

Pharmacol. 2000; 409: 123-131Google Scholar) have been reported. Resolution of the role of ER in TAM- and OHT-induced apoptosis is complicated by the fact that available ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cell lines are derived from independent tumors. These cell lines therefore differ in many respects other than ER content. To simplify analysis of the role of ER in TAM- and OHT-induced apoptosis, we therefore used ER-negative HeLa, human cervical carcinoma cells, and HeLa cells stably transfected to express hERα (HeLaER6 cells) (20Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Google Scholar). These cell lines differ only in the presence or absence of ER (and the neomycin phosphotransferase gene that encodes resistance to G418). Many compounds that are known to induce programmed cell death (PCD) work via pathways that involve mitochondria. The presence of an apoptotic stimulus triggers a rapid increase in mitochondrial permeability, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. One of the causes of the mitochondrial permeability transition is the translocation of the proapoptotic Bax protein from the cytosol to the mitochondria, where it forms selective channels in the outer mitochondrial membrane and facilitates the release into the cytosol of cytochrome c(21Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Google Scholar, 22Shiraishi J. Tatsumi T. Keira N. Akashi K. Mano A. Yamanaka S. Matoba S. Asayama J. Yaoi T. Fushiki S. Fliss H. Nakagawa M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1637-H1647Google Scholar). In the classic apoptotic pathway, this cytosolic cytochromec forms a complex with procaspase 9 and Apaf-1 called the apoptosome, which leads to the ATP-dependent cleavage and activation of pro-caspase 9, the initiator caspase in mitochondrial apoptosis. Activation of pro-caspase 9 results in activation of downstream executioner caspases, such as caspase 3 (23Leist M. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Google Scholar, 24Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Google Scholar, 25Mattson M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 120-129Google Scholar). We find that OHT is able to induce two independent pathways of PCD. An ER-independent pathway kills ER-negative HeLa cells, requires 10–20 μm TAM or OHT, and is not TAM-specific as it is also triggered by the SERM raloxifene (RAL) and by E2. In contrast, submicromolar amounts of TAM and OHT trigger cell death only in ER-positive HeLa cells. This effect is blocked by pre-treatment with E2, RAL, and ICI 182,780, demonstrating that binding of TAM and OHT to the ER is required for this pathway of programmed cell death. The ER-dependent and ER-independent pathways both trigger a mitochondrial permeability transition and share other features of mitochondrial apoptosis, such as translocation of the proapoptotic Bax protein from the cytosol into the mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. However, in contrast to ER-independent PCD, which displays typical apoptotic markers such as PARP cleavage, chromatin condensation, and DNA laddering, a different cell morphology, as well as the absence of those markers, indicates that the ER-dependent pathway does not involve caspase activation. The ER-dependent pathway does not result in the cleavage and activation of pro-caspase 9, the initiator caspase in mitochondrial apoptosis. The OHT·ER-mediated PCD pathway resembles the caspase-independent pathway referred to as necrosis-like PCD. This study describes a novel and highly specific pathway for TAM·ER- and OHT·ER-induced programmed cell death and suggests an additional mechanism to account for the therapeutic efficacy of TAM. Polyclonal antibodies to PARP and cleaved caspase 9 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). COX4 and cytochrome c antibodies were obtained from Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA), and actin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). DiOC6(3) and propidium iodide were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), respectively. The p38 inhibitor SB203580 was obtained from Calbiochem. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum. HeLaER cells were maintained in medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). HeLaER cells were plated in medium without G418 the day before experiments and maintained in G418-free medium throughout the 2–4-day time period of the experiments. To quantitate the percentage of cells in the early stages of programmed cell death, we used a flow cytometry-based method that employs the strong cationic dye DiOC6(3). In healthy cells, the presence of a mitochondrial membrane potential (Δϕm) allows DiOC6(3) to be sequestered in the mitochondria. Cells that are in the early stages of programmed cell death exhibit decreased mitochondrial retention of DiOC6(3). Cells were seeded at 6 × 105 cells per 100-mm plate and incubated for 24 h. After treatment with the indicated ligands, the cells were washed once with PBS and harvested using PBS-EDTA. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in PBS. 40 nm DiOC6(3) was added to the resuspended pellet, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, after which propidium iodide (PI) was added to 5 μg/ml. Relative fluorescence intensities were measured using a Coulter XL benchtop flow cytometer with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 520 nm. Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. After treatments, the cells were washed once with PBS, and harvested with lysis buffer containing 0.02m Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 0.14 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and dithiothreitol. Protein content was measured using Coomassie Blue reagent (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Extracts were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were electroblotted into a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature, probed with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with TBS-Tween, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Signals were detected using the SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). Transient transfections of HeLaER6 cells were performed using LipofectAMINETM 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), using the manufacturer's protocol. 2 × 105 cells per well were seeded in 12-well plates. After 24 h the cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of ATL4 reporter (26Mao C. Shapiro D.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2361-2369Google Scholar), pRLSV40, and PTZ18U. The indicated concentrations of hormone were added 4 h after transfection. After 24 h the cells were harvested, and dual luciferase assays (Promega) were performed using the manufacturer's protocol. After treatment, cells were harvested by scraping and collected into a pellet by centrifugation at 600 rpm for 5 min. At the time of embedding, cells were pipetted out of the epoxy infiltration mixture and put in small BEEM capsules, which were filled up the rest of the way with fresh epoxy, spun to collect cells at the bottom, and placed in the oven overnight at 90 °C to harden. Blocks were sectioned at 60–90 nm with a Diatome diamond knife using a Richart Ultracut E ultramicrotome. The sections were picked up with 200-mesh copper and stained with saturated uranyl acetate, silver, and lead citrate. Sections were viewed on an H600 Hitachi transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Images were shot with Eastman Kodak Co. electron microscopy film. Mitochondrial extraction was performed using the ApoAlert cell fractionation kit (Clontech). HeLa or HeLaER6 cells were seeded at 1 × 107 cells per sample, and various ligands were added after 24 h. After treatment, cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed once, and resuspended in ice-cold fractionation buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Clontech) and dithiothreitol. After incubation on ice for 10 min, cells were homogenized using 2 ml of Kontes Dounce tissue grinders (Fisher). Homogenates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 25 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and designated as cytosolic fractions, and pellets were resuspended in fractionation buffer and designated as mitochondrial fractions. Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Blue assay. 5 × 105 cells were plated in 100-mm plates. After appropriate treatments, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 rpm and 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.8% (w/v) sodium lauryl sarcosine. Lysates were incubated with 10 μl of 1 mg/ml RNase A/RNase T1 mixture at 37 °C for 2 h and 10 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K for 16 h. Samples were run in a 1% agarose gel. To facilitate comparisons between cells that lack ER and cells that contain ER, we used ER-negative, wild-type HeLa cells and our HeLaER6 cells stably transfected to express hERα (20Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Google Scholar). To minimize potential cell stress due to maintaining HeLaER6 cell cells in medium containing the selective agent G418, HeLaER6 cells were plated in medium without G418 the day before experiments and maintained in G418-free medium throughout the experiments. Preliminary studies based on cell morphology suggested that 10–20 μm TAM and OHT were toxic to HeLa and HeLaER6 cells and that submicromolar concentrations of TAM and OHT were not visibly toxic to HeLa cells. To further compare the toxicities of TAM and OHT in HeLaER6 cells and in the parental HeLa cells, we performed dose-response experiments. Because the pathway(s) of programmed cell death induced by TAM and OHT were unknown, we elected to use a quantitative assay for cell death based on the ability of mitochondria to sequester the strong cationic dye DiOC6(3). Damaged mitochondria of apoptotic or necrotic cells exhibit decreased retention of DiOC6(3) and are visualized as a distinct subpopulation of cells in flow cytometry. To determine whether PCD induced by TAM and OHT was ER-dependent, we treated ER-negative HeLa cells and HeLaER6 cells with a range of TAM or OHT concentrations (0.1 nm-1 μm). The percentage of wild-type HeLa cells that were in early stage programmed cell death (low retention of DiOC6(3) but still impermeable to the DNA-intercalating propidium iodide dye) was unaffected by concentrations of TAM or OHT from 0.1 nm to 1 μm (Fig.1). The HeLaER6 cells exhibited an increase in the percentage of cells with decreased retention of DiOC6(3) from 0.1 to 1 μm TAM. Lower concentrations of OHT were needed to produce mitochondrial dysfunction. The percentage of cells with low retention of DiOC6(3) reached a plateau at 10 nm OHT with an IC50 of ∼1 nm OHT (Fig. 1). Much lower concentrations of OHT than TAM were also required to induce cell death in a second cell line, HeLaER5 cells (data not shown). Across a range of concentrations, ∼100-fold lower amounts of OHT than TAM were required to elicit a given percentage of cell death (Fig. 1, compare 10−9m OHT with 10−7m TAM). OHT, the active metabolite of TAM, binds to the ER with at least a 100-fold higher affinity than TAM (27Katzenellenbogen B.S. Norman M.J. Eckert R.L. Peltz S.W. Mangel W.F. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 112-119Google Scholar). In intact cells, OHT exhibits some agonist activity and activates transcription of a reporter gene at concentrations ∼100-fold lower than are required for TAM activation. 2C. Mao and D. J. Shapiro, manuscript in preparation. These data suggested that binding to the ER was important in TAM and OHT-induced death in the HeLaER6 cells. Although these data were consistent with a role for ER in apoptosis induced by low concentrations of TAM and OHT, it was important to test this more directly. Because nmconcentrations of OHT induce death of HeLaER6 cells, it was possible to carry out competition experiments using a large molar excess of other ER ligands over OHT and to evaluate the effect of these ligands on OHT-mediated programmed cell death. We used three structurally dissimilar compounds that are representative of the major classes of ER ligands. RAL is a well studied SERM that exhibits agonist activity in bone and antagonist activity in many other tissues (5Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Google Scholar, 6Shang Y. Brown M. Science. 2002; 295: 2465-2468Google Scholar, 28Park W.C. Jordan V.C. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 82-88Google Scholar). ICI 182,780 is a nearly pure antagonist (29Dauvois S. White R. Parker M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1377-1388Google Scholar, 30Metzger D. Berry M. Ali S. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 579-591Google Scholar), and E2 is the prototypical estrogen. In preliminary studies we examined the effects of E2, RAL, and ICI 182,780 on the HeLaER6 cells. 10 nm OHT effectively induces early stage cell death in the HeLaER6 cells. In contrast, E2, RAL, and ICI did not induce cell death at concentrations from 10 nm to 1 μm (data not shown). To saturate the ER with the ligands, the cells were maintained briefly in medium containing a 100-fold molar excess (1 μm) of ICI 182,780, RAL, or E2. OHT was then added to 10 nm, and the cells were maintained in medium containing the various ER ligands for 3 days and analyzed by flow cytometry. A discrete shoulder corresponding to a subpopulation of cells undergoing early stage programmed cell death was seen with the cells maintained in medium containing OHT alone (Fig.2 A, OHT). The presence of a 100-fold molar excess of ICI 182,780, RAL, or E2 blocked the appearance of this subpopulation of cells (Fig. 2, A–C). The quantitative flow cytometry results were reflected in morphological changes in the cells. After 4 days in OHT-containing medium, the HeLaER6 cells were sparse, and their morphology was very different from that observed in the control, vehicle-treated cells. Control cells and cells maintained in OHT plus ICI 182,780 or OHT plus RAL were dividing actively and exhibited similar morphology (Fig. 2 B). 1 μm TAM is required to induce maximal programmed cell death in HeLaER6 cells. Because two of the other ER ligands are toxic to the cells at extremely high concentrations (see Fig. 6), it was not possible to carry out traditional competition experiments in which these ER ligands were present at a 100-fold molar excess over TAM. However, because TAM binds to ER with a much lower affinity than E2, RAL, and ICI, we elected to attempt competition experiments in the presence of equimolar concentrations of the competitors and TAM. Although they were not present in excess over TAM, 1 μm ICI 182,780, 1 μm RAL, or 1 μm E2 were able to almost completely protect the cells from TAM-induced programmed cell death (Fig. 2 D). These data provide compelling evidence for a role for ER- in TAM-induced apoptosis of HeLaER6 cells. The most straightforward explanation for the ability of equimolar concentrations of E2, ICI 182,780, and RAL to block TAM-induced apoptosis is that E2, ICI 182,780, and RAL are known to bind to hERα with much higher affinity than TAM (31Wijayaratne A.L. Nagel S.C. Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Norris J.D. Fowlkes D.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5828-5840Google Scholar). The cell death response is sometimes triggered by the activation of stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase-based signaling pathways. It was of interest to determine whether the p38 kinase, and perhaps the JNK kinase, were involved in OHT-induced programmed cell death. Low, 0.5–2 μm, concentrations of SB203580 specifically inhibit the p38 pathway (32Lali F.V. Hunt A.E. Turner S.J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7395-7402Google Scholar). At higher concentrations (5–10 μm) SB203580 also inhibits some JNK subtypes (33Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.H. Su M.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Google Scholar, 34Clerk A. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 93-96Google Scholar). Pre-treatment of the HeLaER6 cells with 1 μm SB203580 reduced the percentage of cells in early stage programmed cell death by almost 40%. When the cells were pre-treated with 5 μm SB203580, this subpopulation was reduced by almost 90% (Fig. 3.3). These data suggest that activation of the p38 and perhaps JNK kinases plays a major role in OHT-induced programmed cell death. A potential mechanism for ER-dependent OHT cytotoxicity is binding of OHT·ER to estrogen response elements in the DNA inducing expression of pro-apoptotic genes. To determine whether OHT exhibits agonist activity in HeLaER6 cells, we performed transient transfections using a reporter gene containing four copies of the consensus estrogen response element (ERE). E2 elicited a robust activation of the reporter, whereas 10 nm OHT, ICI 182,780, or RAL did not activate the reporter significantly (Fig. 4). Although OHT is not a classical strong agonist in these cells, these data do not exclude the possibility that OHT·ER either activates unusual EREs in specific genes or is tethered to genes containing AP-1 or SP-1 sites (35Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Scanlan T.S. Shiau A.K. Uht R.M. Webb P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 311-317Google Scholar). When visualized by light microscopy, cells maintained in medium containing 10 nm OHT did not display typical apoptotic morphology and became elongated instead of rounded (Fig.2 B). In contrast, cells treated with 10–20 μmOHT displayed typical apoptotic morphology, including cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing, and detached from the surface of the plate (data not shown). These observations led us to consider the possibility that treatment with 10 nm OHT induces non-classical programmed cell death. To examine cell morphology in more detail, we performed electron microscopy. Prior to analysis the cells were treated with 10 nm OHT for 4 days or with 20 μm OHT for 2 days. Control apoptotic cells were obtained by treating the cells with etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor. Cells treated with etoposide or 20 μm OHT exhibited classical markers of apoptosis, most notably cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation (Fig.5, A, B, andD). In contrast, cells treated with 10 nm OHT were significantly more elongated compared with untreated, etoposide-treated, and 20 μm OHT-treated cells (Fig.5 C). There was a significant reduction in the number of cellular organelles present compared with untreated cells, but chromatin condensation was absent, as was membrane blebbing. One of the defining features of caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death is chromatin fragmentation (36Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Google Scholar, 37Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Google Scholar) and DNA laddering. To further clarify whether the OHT·ER death program is apoptotic and caspase-dependent, we assayed for the appearance of a DNA ladder by agarose gel electrophoresis. A DNA ladder was observed with DNA extracted from 10 μm OHT-treated cells but not with DNA from cells treated with 10 nm OHT (Fig. 5 E). Another widely used marker for apoptosis is caspase-dependent cleavage of PARP into 89- and 22-kDa fragments. PARP cleavage was not detected in extracts from HeLaER6 cells maintained in medium containing 10 nm OHT (Fig.5 F). However, cells maintained in 20 μm OHT exhibit PARP cleavage. These results indicate that 10–20 μm OHT induces a caspase-dependent death pathway whereas 10 nm OHT induces a caspase-independent death pathway that shares some features with classic apoptosis, such as mitochondrial dysfunction. 10 μm OHT and TAM begin to initiate death of HeLa cells, whereas 20 μmOHT or Tam produces robust activation of the cell death pathway (Fig.6 A). To determine whether high concentrations of other ER ligands induce apoptosis, we tested the ability of 10–20 μm E2 and RAL to induce apoptosis. Although 1 μm E2 and RAL protect against apoptosis induced by low concentrations of OHT and TAM (Fig.2), 2 days in 10–20 μm E2 induces apoptosis in ER-negative HeLa cells, about as well as similar concentrations of OHT and TAM (Fig. 6 A). 20 μm RAL triggered apoptosis even more rapidly, with significant cell death observed less than a day after adding it to the culture medium (data not shown). These data indicate that the ER-independent death pathway is not specific for TAM and OHT. To analyze whether these diverse ER ligands activate classical caspase-dependent apoptosis, we examined the ability of 20 μm OHT, TAM, RAL, E2, and ICI 182,780 to induce PARP cleavage and cleavage of the precursor of the initiator caspase, caspase-9. In both HeLa cells and HeLaER6 cells 20 μm TAM, OHT, RAL, and E2 induced PARP cleavage and formation of activated caspase 9 (Fig. 6, B andC). ICI 182,780 did not induce significant PARP cleavage or caspase 9 activation (Fig. 6, B and C) and does not kill HeLa cells (data not shown). Depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane is widely recognized as one of the early markers of programmed cell death. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization therefore formed the basis of our initial assay for cell death. Because 10 nmOHT causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δϕm), it was clear that mitochondria were involved in the death pathway. To determine the point at which this death pathway deviates from the classic caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway, we looked at apoptotic markers at the steps before and after mitochondrial membrane depolarization. We examined the ability of OHT·ER to induce translocation of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, from the cytosol into the mitochondria, the release of cytochromec from the mitochondria into the cytosol, and the activation of the most upstream caspase involved in mitochondrial apoptosis, pro-caspase 9. Mitochondria were isolated from HeLaER6 cells (Fig.7 A) a"

The NADPH-dependent activity of regulatory GAPDH from spinach chloroplasts was affected by the redox potential (E m,7.9, −353 ± 11 mV) through the action of thioredoxin f. The redox dependence of recombinant GapB (E m,7.9, −347 ± 9 mV) was similar to native GAPDH, whereas GapA was essentially redox-insensitive. GapB mutants having one or two C-terminal cysteines mutated into serines (C358S, C349S, C349S/C358S) were less redox-sensitive than GapB. Different mutants with other cysteines substituted by serines (C18S, C274S, C285S) still showed strong redox regulation. Fully active GapB was a tetramer of B-subunits, and, when incubated with NAD, it associated to a high molecular weight oligomer showing low NADPH-dependent activity.

This covalent modification is required for the NAD-dependent association into higher oligomers and inhibition of the NADPH-activity.

Two isoforms of GAPDH are found in the chloroplast stroma of higher plants: the A4 isoform constituted by four identical GapA subunits, and the AxBx isoform formed by GapA and GapB subunits in apparent stoichiometric ratios (1Pupillo P. Faggiani R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 581-592Google Scholar, 2Cerff R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 243-247Google Scholar). The AB-isoform is finely regulated (3Pupillo P. Giuliani Piccari G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 475-482Google Scholar, 4Wolosiuk R.A. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6456-6461Google Scholar, 5Buchanan B. Annu. Rev.

Biophys. 1995; 324: 201-208Google Scholar), whereas the A4-isoform is known as the non-regulatory GAPDH (9Scagliarini S. Trost P. Pupillo P. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 1307-1315Google Scholar). GapA is 336 amino acids long inSpinacia oleracea and 80% identical to the N-terminal moiety of GapB, which contains an additional C-terminal extension (CTE) of 28 residues (10Brinkmann H. Cerff R. Salomon M. Soll J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 81-94Google Scholar, 11Ferri G. Stoppini M. Meloni M. Zapponi M.C. Iadarola P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 36-42Google Scholar). The CTE includes two invariant cysteines and nine negatively charged amino acids, and is highly conserved among different plant species. Despite the high similarity between GapA and GapB, only the latter subunit seems to be involved in the regulatory mechanism of the enzyme (12Baalmann E. Scheibe R. Cerff R. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 505-513Google Scholar, 13Li A.D. Anderson L.E. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1201-1209Google Scholar). The activity of chloroplast GAPDH in vivo is stimulated by light (14Ziegler H. Ziegler I. Planta. 1965; 65: 369-380Google Scholar). In the dark, regulatory GAPDH is found as a high molecular weight form endowed with low NADPH-dependent activity, although the activity in the presence of NADH is normal. Upon illumination, regulatory GAPDH is activated concomitant with dissociation of the high oligomers into lower molecular weight forms, mostly active tetramers (15Scagliarini S. Trost P. Pupillo P. Valenti V. Planta. 1993; 190: 313-319Google Scholar, 16Baalmann E. Backhausen J.E. Kitzmann C. Scheibe R. Bot. Acta. 1994; 107: 313-320Google Scholar). Purified regulatory GAPDH shows a similar behavior: effectors such as NADP(H), BPGA, Pi, and ATP activate the enzyme by stabilizing the tetrameric conformation (A2B2), whereas NAD(H) does the opposite by inducing the enzyme to aggregate into a high oligomer (apparently a hexadecamer, A8B8) (3Pupillo P. Giuliani Piccari G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 475-482Google Scholar, 7Trost P. Scagliarini S. Valenti V. Pupillo P. Planta. 1993; 190: 320-326Google Scholar, 8Baalmann E. Backhausen J.E. Rak C. Vetter S. Scheibe R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 201-208Google Scholar). The inter-exchange between A2B2 and A8B8 conformations has been suggested to be part of the light-activation mechanism (15Scagliarini S. Trost P. Pupillo P. Valenti V. Planta. 1993; 190: 313-319Google Scholar, 16Baalmann E. Backhausen J.E. Kitzmann C. Scheibe R. Bot. Acta. 1994; 107: 313-320Google Scholar), but the in vivo aggregation of GAPDH into high molecular weight forms may involve still other proteins, such as the small regulatory protein CP12 and phosphoribulokinase (17Wara-Aswapati O. Kemble R. Bradbeer J.W. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 34-39Google Scholar, 18Süss K.-H. Arkona C. Manteuffel R. Adler K. Poc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5514-5518Google Scholar, 19Wedell N.

In principle, the two mechanisms are not reciprocally exclusive and might both contribute to the complex regulation of GAPDH and the Calvin cycle. The NADPH-dependent activity of regulatory GAPDH is stimulated by reduced thioredoxin f (Trx f) (21Wolosiuk R.A. Buchanan B.B. Nature. 1977; 266: 565-567Google Scholar,22Wolosiuk R.A. Buchanan B.B. Plant Physiol. 1978; 61: 669-671Google Scholar). In pea leaf GAPDH, the two conserved cysteines of the CTE can form a disulfide bridge (23Qi J. Isupov M.N. Littlechild J.A. Anderson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35247-35252Google Scholar) and are envisioned as likely targets for Trx regulation (12Baalmann E. Scheibe R. Cerff R. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 505-513Google Scholar, 25Ruelland E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 136-141Google Scholar). Although direct evidence of a regulatory role of this disulfide is lacking, it is well known that native or recombinant GapB truncated of the whole CTE (GapBΔCTE) are fully active and unaffected by reductants and effectors (12Baalmann E. Scheibe R. Cerff R. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 505-513Google Scholar,13Li A.D. Anderson L.E. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1201-1209Google Scholar, 24Zapponi M.C. Iadarola P. Stoppini M. Ferri G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 395-402Google Scholar), indicating that the fine-tuning of GAPDH regulation depends on the CTE. Accordingly, a model has been proposed in which the “light-activation” of photosynthetic GAPDH was first mediated by Trx through reduction of a disulfide bridge in the CTE and then by BPGA whose increased concentration in the light was thought to stabilize the active A2B2 conformation (8Baalmann E. Backhausen J.E. Rak C. Vetter S. Scheibe R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 201-208Google Scholar, 12Baalmann E. Scheibe R. Cerff R. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 505-513Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated the redox regulation of photosynthetic GAPDH by a site-specific mutagenesis approach. Spinach GapA and GapB have been expressed in Escherichia coli, and all cysteines that could be potential targets for Trx action have been individually mutated to serines. Purified mutant proteins have been tested for their responsiveness to Trx f and to the substrate effectors, NADP and NAD. It is shown that Cys-349 and Cys-358, belonging to the CTE, are both required for Trx-dependent regulation of the GAPDH. The formation of the regulatory disulfide between these cysteines inhibits the enzyme and is essential for the NAD-dependent aggregation into high molecular weight forms. The results are discussed in light of the recent crystal structure of the A4 isoform of spinach GAPDH complexed with NADP (26Fermani S. Ripamonti A. Sabatino P. Zanotti G. Scagliarini S. Sparla F. Trost P. Pupillo P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 527-542Google Scholar) and provide new insights into the molecular basis of GAPDH inactivation in the dark. The cDNAs for S. oleracea GapA, GapB, and GapBΔCTE, inserted in the expression vector pET-14 and kindly provided by N. Wedell, were excised from the plasmid with endonucleases BamHI and NdeI (Promega) and purified from low melting point agarose gel (0.8%, w/v) with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Fragments were ligated intoBamHI- and NdeI-predigested pET-28a(+) (Novagen), and the ligation mixtures were used to transform E. colicells, strain BL21(DE3). Point mutations were introduced by PCR on the construct containing the coding region for GapB. Primers were as follows: C18SUp: 5′-TTG GTA GGA ATT TCC TTA GAA GCT GGC ACG GCG G-3′ and C18SDown: 5′-TCT TTG CGG CCG TGC CAG CTT CTA AGG AAA TCC-3′; C274SUp: 5′-TGT GTT GGA TGT GTC CGA CAT CCC CCT CG-3′ and C274SDown: 5′-GAG GGG GAT GTC GGA CAC ATC CAA CAC AC-3′; C285SUp: 5′-TGT CAG TTG ATT TCA GGA GTT CTG ATT TCT CAT CTA CAA TCG-3′ and C285SDown: 5′-ATT GTA GAT GAG AAA TCA GAA CTC CTG AAA TCA ACT GAC ACG-3′; C349SUp: 5′-CAT TGG AAG ATT TCT CCA AGG ACA ACC CTG-3′ and C349SDown: 5′-CAG GGT TGT CCT TGG AGA AAT CTT CCA ATG-3′; C358SUp: 5′-CAA CCC TGC TGA TGA AGA ATC CAA ACT TTA CGA G-3′ and C358SDown: 5′-CTC GTA AAG TTT GGA TTC TTC ATC AGC AGG GTT G-3′. A double mutant (C349S/C358S) was constructed by PCR using C358S as the template with primers C349SUp and C349SDown. PCR and transformation reactions were performed according to the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Single colonies from each mutagenesis reaction were picked up, transferred into liquid culture (LB medium supplied with kanamycin, 50 μg/ml), and grown overnight at 37 °C under vigorous shaking (150–170 rpm). Plasmidic DNA have been extracted and sequenced before transferring the constructs intoE. coli BL21(DE3). In a typical preparation, 20 ml of an overnight culture were transferred to 250 ml of fresh LB medium supplied with kanamycin (50 μg/ml). When the optical density of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.7 OD, expression was induced by addition of 0.4 mm IPTG. After 3 h of growth, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A), and pelleted again before storage at −70 °C. Frozen cells were suspended in 25 ml of buffer A supplemented with 0.5 mm NADP+ and lysated at 30 °C for 15 min in the presence of lysozyme (100 μg/ml). Nucleic acids were digested by incubation in 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μg/ml RNase A, 1 μg/ml DNase I for 20 min at room temperature under continuous shaking. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min). An equal volume of cold acetone (−18 °C) was slowly added to the supernatant, and immediately centrifuged at −20 °C for 20 min at 20,000 × g. The corresponding pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A plus 0.5 mmNADP+ and clarified by centrifugation (20 min, 20,000 × g). The supernatant was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose HP 16/10 anion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was thoroughly washed with buffer A before applying a linear potassium phosphate gradient corresponding to five column volumes (25–500 mm potassium phosphate for GapA and GapBΔCTE; 25–700 mmpotassium phosphate for GapB and site-specific mutants of GapB). Active fractions of 1 ml were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon cell, YM10 membrane). To remove the N-terminal His tag, recombinant proteins were incubated overnight at 20 °C in the presence of 10% glycerol (v/v) and thrombin protease (AmershamBiosciences). Following His tag cleavage, enzymes were diluted 10-fold in buffer A and loaded onto a second anion exchange column (Mono Q HR 5/5, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Linear salt gradients were 25–500 mm potassium phosphate in 15 ml for GapA and GapBΔCTE, and 25–700 mm potassium phosphate for GapB and relative mutants. Active fractions were collected, stored at +4 °C, and used within 2 days. Final preparations were electrophoretically pure as judged by SDS-PAGE performed on precast 12.5% Excelgel SDS Homogeneous (AmershamBiosciences). Native regulatory GAPDH from spinach chloroplasts was purified according to ref. 9Scagliarini S. Trost P. Pupillo P. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 1307-1315Google Scholar, except for the final size-exclusion chromatographic steps, which were omitted. Native GAPDH preparations were more than 90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. Purified GAPDH was stored at 4 °C in buffer A for no more than 2 days before use. GAPDH activity was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm and 25 °C, in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 3 mm 3-phosphoglycerate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 units ml−1 of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (from rabbit muscle, Sigma), 2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm NADPH or NADH. For calculations, an ε340for NAD(P)H of 6.23 mm−1 was used. In redox titration experiments, the reaction mixture was the same except that Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.5) was substituted by 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.9. Before each redox titration experiment, the enzyme preparation buffer was exchanged into 100 mmTricine-NaOH, pH 7.9, by a passage through a Sephadex G-25 HiTrap Fast Desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). When necessary, enzyme solutions were either diluted or concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon, YM10 membrane) to give a final NADPH-dependent activity of 1500 nmol min−1 ml−1(corresponding to an approximate enzyme concentration of 15 μg ml−1). Enzyme samples (40 μl) were incubated for 3 h at 25 °C with 2 μg ml−1 of recombinant spinach Trx f, kindly provided by P. Schürmann, and 20 mm DTT in various dithiol/disulfide ratios, in a total volume of 100 μl (27Hutchinson R.S. Ort D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 220-228Google Scholar, 28Hirasawa M. Ruelland E. Schepens I. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Knaff D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3344-3350Google Scholar). Following incubation, the NADPH-dependent activity (or in some cases the NADH-dependent activity) was assayed. The titration results were fit by non-linear regression (CoStat, CoHort Software) to the Nernst equation setting the value of n at 2 (the disulfide/dithiol is expected to be a two-electron transfer process), according to Refs. 27Hutchinson R.S. Ort D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 220-228Google Scholar and 28Hirasawa M. Ruelland E. Schepens I. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Knaff D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3344-3350Google Scholar. In some experiments, titration data were poorly fitted to the Nernst equation containing one redox component, but good fits were obtained with the Nernst equation containing two redox components. In these cases, the twoE m,7.9 values and the contribution of the two components have been optimized by the software. Relative activities are expressed as a fraction of the activity measured after 3-h incubation with 20 mm reduced DTT and Trx f (2 μg ml−1). Because the activity of any oxidized isoform never reached zero, we introduced into the Nernst equation a parameter representing the fraction of the relative activity that was subjected to redox regulation (i.e. the difference between the relative activity of the fully reduced form and the relative activity of the fully oxidized form). In each regression analysis, the exact value of this parameter (between 0 and 1) was optimized by the software. The calculations of the E m,7.9 values of the regulatory disulfides were based on a value ofE m,7.9 for the couple reduced/oxidized DTT of −380 mV (29Lees W.J. Whitesides G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 642-647Google Scholar, 30Hutchinson R.S. Groom Q. Ort R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6679-6688Google Scholar). Based on this value, the calculated E h of the different incubation mixtures containing varying ratios of reduced and oxidized DTT ranged between −402 and −283 mV. Each titration experiment has been repeated on two independent enzyme preparations at least. TheE m,7.9 values are given as means ± S.D. (when omitted for the sake of clarity, S.D. values were between 5 and 15 mV). The aggregation state of purified recombinant proteins in the presence of either NADP or NAD was analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column connected to a Smart System (Amersham Biosciences). The column was calibrated with standard globular proteins (Gel Filtration LMW and HMW Calibration kit, Amersham Biosciences). A linear relationship between log(apparent molecular mass) and elution volume was obtained in the range between 13.7 (ribonuclease A) and 669 kDa (thyroglobulin). The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm KCl plus 0.2 mm NAD (associating conditions) or 0.2 mm NADP (dissociating conditions). Before loading, purified proteins were desalted in 100 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.9, and incubated with 0.2 mm NAD or 0.2 mmNADP for 2 h on ice. Chromatographic runs were performed at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1. Absorbance was monitored on-line at 280 and 260 nm. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and the activity was determined by the standard assay with NADPH. Precise elution volumes were recorded in correspondence of the 280-nm absorbance peak, and apparent molecular masses were calculated on the basis of the column calibration. For the present study, spinach GAPDH subunits A and B (GapA, GapB) have been individually expressed in Escherichia coli cells and purified to homogeneity before characterization. The IPTG-induced expression of both GapA and GapB was strong, resulting in prominent bands in denaturating gel electrophoresis of whole extracts of transformed E. coli cells (not shown). Although heterologously expressed GapA and GapB included an N-terminal His tag provided by the expression vector (pET28, Novagen), any attempt to use metal affinity chromatography for protein purification was unsuccessful because of the strong inactivating effect of the eluant (imidazole) on the enzyme. We therefore developed a different purification method consisting of (i) acetone fractionation of the cell lysate followed by (ii) a first anion exchange column (Q-Sepharose), (iii) the His tag removal by thrombin treatment, and (iv) a second anion exchange on Mono Q. Final preparations obtained by this procedure were electrophoretically pure and enzymatically active (80–130 μmol min−1 mg−1). Average yields varied between 0.9 (GapA) and 1.3 (GapB) mg of pure protein per liter of liquid culture. The dependence of native regulatory GAPDH (purified from spinach chloroplasts) from the ambient redox potential in the presence of spinach Trx f is shown in Fig.1 A. In this and analogous experiments the redox poise was set by a mixture of reduced and oxidized DTT, and Trx f was added as a potential redox mediator between DTT and regulatory cysteines of GAPDH (27Hutchinson R.S. Ort D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 220-228Google Scholar, 28Hirasawa M. Ruelland E. Schepens I. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Knaff D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3344-3350Google Scholar). The pH of the incubation mixture (pH 7.9) reflected stromal pH during photosynthesis (31Werdan K. Heldt H.W. Milovancev M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 396: 276-292Google Scholar). Interestingly, although reduced DTT directly activated the NADPH-dependent activity of GAPDH to some extent (3Pupillo P. Giuliani Piccari G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 475-482Google Scholar, 8Baalmann E. Backhausen J.E. Rak C. Vetter S. Scheibe R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 201-208Google Scholar, 32Müller B. Ziegler I. Ziegler H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 101-106Google Scholar), oxidized DTT (20 mm) failed to show any effect in the absence of Trx f even after 24-h preincubation. Trx f, therefore, was absolutely required for the redox titration of GAPDH activity. The activity responses of GAPDH at varying redox potential were interpolated by a Nernst equation to estimate the standard redox potential(s) (E m,7.9) of the regulatory disulfide(s). A reasonable good fit was obtained to a Nernst equation including one single-redox component, and an averageE m,7.9 of −353 ± 11 mV for the NADPH-dependent activity was estimated (Fig.1 A). The redox titration of recombinant GapB gave similar results, with an average E m,7.9 value of −347 ± 9 mV (Fig. 1 B). In some experiments, a second redox component was detectable in both GAPDH and GapB, but this accounted for less than 10% of the total response and was not further investigated. As expected (9Scagliarini S. Trost P. Pupillo P. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 1307-1315Google Scholar), non-regulatory GapA was essentially insensitive to the redox poise (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the Trx-mediated regulation of the NADPH-dependent activity of native GAPDH appears to depend on GapB exclusively. The NADPH-dependent activity of oxidized GapB (E h > −300 mV) as measured by the standard assay was 60–80% inhibited with respect to the reduced form, similar to native GAPDH. Under the same conditions the NADH-dependent activity of both GAPDH and GapB, and indeed all NADH-dependent activities of various enzyme forms, were decreased by less than 20% (Fig. 1 A, and not shown). Steady-state kinetic comparison of reduced versus oxidized GapB, following 3-h incubation with 20 mm reduced/oxidized DTT and 2 μg ml−1 Trx f, revealed that the inhibition of the oxidized form did not depend on decreased affinity for NADPH (K m(NADPH) 2 × 10−5m for both forms). The GapB-oxidized form showed, instead, a decrease of ∼3-fold in apparent maximum velocity (V max(app)), a kinetic parameter depending on both k cat and K m for BPGA, according to the equation (33Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. J. Wiley, New York1975: 607-623Google Scholar),Vmax(app)=kcat/(1+Km(BPGA)/[BPGA])(Eq. 1) GapB contains seven cysteines: two are located within the CTE (Cys-349 and Cys-358) and are therefore specific for GapB; the other five (Cys-18, Cys-149, Cys-153, Cys-274, and Cys-285) are conserved also in GapA (Fig. 2). During the catalytic cycle, Cys-149 is engaged in the formation of the covalent intermediate hemithioacetal (34Harris J.I. Waters M. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 13. Academic Press, New York1976: 1-49Google Scholar), and the vicinal Cys-153 is close to the active site (26Fermani S. Ripamonti A. Sabatino P. Zanotti G. Scagliarini S. Sparla F. Trost P. Pupillo P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 527-542Google Scholar) making it an unlikely candidate for the formation of a regulatory disulfide bridge. To further characterize the redox regulatory mechanism of GAPDH, and to locate the target cysteines of Trx f activity, we specifically mutagenized all Cys residues of GapB into Ser, except Cys-149 and Cys-153. Also, we produced a C349S/C358S double mutant (with both CTE cysteines exchanged into Ser) and a mutant lacking the CTE altogether (GapBΔCTE). The heterologously expressed mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity and found to be enzymatically active (specific activities between 80 and 130 μmol min−1 mg−1). All mutants were somehow affected in their redox sensitivity (Fig.3). The three mutants C18S, C274S, and C285S, carrying mutations on cysteines not belonging to the CTE, were quite sensitive to the redox potential. At variance from GapB, however, redox titrations of these mutants evidenced the existence of two redox components. The component accounting for most of the redox-dependent response hadE m,7.9 values close to that of GapB (C18S, −345 mV; C274S, −340 mV; and C285S, −340 mV). The second component exhibited a smaller control on the activity and was therefore difficult to define in terms of redox potential. Mutants C349S, C358S, and GapBΔCTE and the double mutant C349S/C358S were, on the contrary, less sensitive to the redox potential than GapB (Fig. 3) suggesting an involvement of CTE cysteines in the redox regulation of GapB activity. However, whereas the mutant GapBΔCTE appeared to be almost redox-insensitive, the other mutants showed some redox dependence. Under oxidizing conditions (Eh > −330 mV), mutants C358S and C349S/C358S were 20% to 30% inhibited with respect to their reduced forms. Nernst interpolation of the redox-sensitive activity of these mutants gaveE m,7.9 values of −350 mV (C358S) and −355 mV (C349S/C358S). Mutant C349S was characterized by a less reducing E m,7.9 (−330 mV) and substantial redox sensitivity (40% inhibited under oxidizing conditions). It is long known that NADP activates the NADPH-dependent activity of regulatory GAPDH by stabilizing the active tetrameric conformation, whereas NAD stabilizes a less active oligomer of high molecular mass (Fig.4) (3Pupillo P. Giuliani Piccari G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 475-482Google Scholar, 7Trost P. Scagliarini S. Valenti V. Pupillo P. Planta. 1993; 190: 320-326Google Scholar, 8Baalmann E. Backhausen J.E. Rak C. Vetter S. Scheibe R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 201-208Google Scholar). Recombinant GapB does also aggregate to oligomers in the presence of NAD, but GapA exists only as a tetramer (12Baalmann E. Scheibe R. Cerff R. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 505-513Google Scholar, 13Li A.D. Anderson L.E. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1201-1209Google Scholar, 15Scagliarini S. Trost P. Pupillo P. Valenti V. Planta. 1993; 190: 313-319Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass of GAPDH isoforms and mutants were estimated by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column calibrated with standard globular proteins (Fig. 4 and Table I). GapA eluted as a 131-kDa protein both in the presence of NAD and NADP, a value similar to the theoretical molecular mass of the tetramer (145 kDa). In the presence of NADP the GapB had an apparent molecular mass of 240 kDa, significantly higher than its calculated molecular mass as a tetramer (157 kDa). On the other hand, mutant GapBΔCTEbehaved as a 149-kDa protein under same conditions, matching its theoretical tetramer molecular mass of 146 kDa. Taken together these results suggest an extended conformation of B4 tetramers, made bulky by the CTE. The latter, under these conditions, is probably exposed to the medium without sticking to the surface of the tetramer.Table IApparent molecular mass and possible subunit composition of GAPDH isoforms and site-specific mutants as measured by size-exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200GAPDH isoform or mutantTheoretical mol. mass (tetramer)Apparent mol. mass (NADP)Subunit compositionApparent mol. mass (NAD)Subunit compositionkDakDaRegulatory GAPDH (spinach chloroplast)151188A2B2aBased on the assumption that the apparent molecular mass of the GapA subunit was 32.7 kDa (131/4) and that of GapB was 60 kDa (240/4).765A8B8bA likely value: the large conformational changes caused by NAD on GapB subunits leave some uncertainty.GapA145131A4132A4GapB157240B4540B8bA likely value: the large conformational changes caused by NAD on GapB subunits leave some uncertainty.C18S157247B4542B8bA likely value: the large conformational changes caused by NAD on GapB subunits leave some uncertainty.C274S157240B4543B8bA likely value: the"

Receptor-activated Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by activated TGF-β receptor complex, and after phosphorylation these Smads associate with a common mediator Smad, Smad4. Subsequently, this hetero-oligomeric complex translocates into the nucleus, where Smads bind to DNA or associate with other transcription factors (e.g. FAST-1/2, TFE-3, activating transcription factor-2, AP-1, CREB-binding protein/p300, and Sp1) and control the transcription of various TGF-β-responsive genes (7Massague J.

In this study, we have constructed recombinant adenoviruses coding for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 and used these to examine the role of Smads in the regulation of MMP-13 expression in human gingival fibroblasts. In addition, we have examined the cross-talk between the Smad and p38 MAPK pathways in the regulation of MMP-13 expression. Our results show that Smad3 mediates the induction of MMP-13 expression by TGF-β, whereas Smad2 is not involved in this context. Activation of p38α with its upstream activators MKK3b and MKK6b and simultaneous co-expression of Smad3 results in the induction of MMP-13 expression. In addition, activation of p38α induces the nuclear translocation of Smad3, indicating that Smad3 is activated by p38α either directly or indirectly via endogenous mediator. Together these results indicate that Smad3 is involved in TGF-β-elicited induction of the expression of MMP-13 in human gingival fibroblasts and that this involves cross-talk between Smad3 and the p38 MAPK pathway.

Adenoviral infections of human gingival fibroblasts were performed as described previously (5Ravanti L. Häkkinen L. Larjava H. Saarialho-Kere U. Foschi M. Han J. Kähäri V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For examining the activation of HA-Smad2 and HA-Smad3, human gingival fibroblasts were infected in suspension with RAdSmad2 and RAdSmad3 in DMEM with 1% FCS and incubated for 18 h. Thereafter, the medium was replaced with DMEM without FCS, and the incubations were continued for 24 h. The cultures were treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml), and the cell layers were harvested at various time points and analyzed with Western blotting for the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Thereafter, the filters were stripped and reprobed with monoclonal anti-HA antibody to confirm equal loading and with total Smad2 and Smad3 antibodies to detect the total amounts of Smad2 and Smad3. For examining the phosphorylation of adenovirally produced HA-Smad2, the cell layers were also harvested in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at +4 °C using anti-HA high affinity matrix (from Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and phosphorylated Smad2 was detected by Western blotting using phospho-Smad2 antibody. Equal loading was confirmed by reprobing the filter with anti-HA antibody. In experiments for elucidating the effects of Smads on the expression of MMP-13, human gingival fibroblasts were infected in suspension with adenoviruses for Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 or dominant-negative Smad3 and with empty control virus RAd66 or RAdLacZ at MOI 500, plated, and incubated for 18 h in DMEM containing 1% FCS. Thereafter, the medium was changed into DMEM without FCS. After a 24-h incubation, the cells were treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 24 h, and the conditioned media were analyzed for the levels of pro-MMP-13 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Total cellular RNA was analyzed with Northern blot hybridizations for MMP-13, pro-α1(I) collagen, PAI-1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNAs. In experiments with RAdSmads together with adenoviruses RAdp38α, RAdMKK3bE, RAdMKK6bE, RAdMEK1CA, or RAdp38AF, human gingival fibroblasts were infected as described above, either treated with SB203580 (10 μm) or left untreated, and incubated for 24 h. The conditioned media were analyzed for the levels of pro-MMP-13, pro-MMP-1, and TIMP-1, and the cell layers were harvested for RNA extraction or for determination of the activation of p38 and ERK1/2. Aliquots of conditioned media or cell lysates were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (AmershamBiosciences). The membranes were blocked against nonspecific binding using 5% skim milk. Proteins were detected using specific primary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antisera against phospho-Smad2 (PS2) and phospho-Smad1 (PS1), which shows cross-reactivity with phosphorylated Smad3, were kind gifts from Dr. Aristidis Moustakas (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden) (28Piek E.

Polyclonal antibodies for phospho-p38, p38, phospho-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The blots were visualized by the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Total cellular RNA was extracted with the Qiagen rapid RNA purification kit. Equal aliquots of total RNA were fractionated on 0.8% agarose gel containing 2.2m formaldehyde, transferred to Zeta Probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) by vacuum transfer (VacuGene XL; LKB, Bromma, Sweden), and immobilized by UV cross-linking and heating at 80 °C for 30 min. The filters were prehybridized for 3–4 h and subsequently hybridized for 20 h with cDNAs labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random priming. For hybridizations, fragments covering the coding region and part of the 3′-untranslated region of human MMP-13 cDNA (altogether 1.9 kb) were used (30Johansson N. Westermarck J. Leppä S.

Specific hybridization was visualized with autoradiography. To examine the nuclear translocation of HA-Smads produced by adenoviruses, human gingival fibroblasts were infected in suspension with RAdSmad2, RAdSmad3, and RAdSmad4 and with control virus RAd66 at MOI 500 as described above, plated on sterile coverslips, and incubated for 18 h. Thereafter, the medium was changed to DMEM without FCS, and the incubations continued for 24 h. The cells were treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 2 h, fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 6 min, and stained with rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody using rhodamine-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody (Calbiochem). In experiments investigating the effect of MKK3bE and p38α on the activation and nuclear translocation of Smad3, gingival fibroblasts were infected in suspension with adenoviruses for HA-tagged Smad3, FLAG-tagged p38α, constitutively active MKK3b, or dominant negative p38α and with empty control virus RAd66 at MOI 500. The cells were plated on sterile coverslips in DMEM without FCS and incubated for 12 h in the absence or presence of SB203580 (5 μm). Thereafter, the cells were fixed with MeOH and stained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibodies (Calbiochem). To examine the role of Smads in TGF-β-elicited induction of human MMP-13 expression, we constructed replication-deficient adenoviruses RAdSmad2, RAdSmad3, and RadSmad4, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Smad2 and Smad3 coded by these viruses contain N-terminal HA-tags, and Smad4 has an HA tag in the C terminus. The cDNAs coding for HA-tagged Smads were subcloned to pCA3 shuttle vector under the control of cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter and cotransfected with adenoviral backbone plasmid pBHG10 into 293 cells, in which the adenoviruses were generated by recombination and packaged. To characterize the recombinant adenoviruses for HA-tagged Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, HaCaT keratinocytes were infected with the adenoviruses at MOI 500, and the expression of the corresponding Smads was analyzed with Western blotting using anti-HA-antibody. As shown in Fig.1 A, the expression of HA-tagged Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 was detected in HaCaT cells infected with the corresponding Smad adenoviruses 24 h after infection. Receptor-activated Smad2 and Smad3 have a C-terminal consensus motif, SSXS, in which the two last serine residues are phosphorylated by activated TGF-β receptor complex (35Souchelnytskyi S. Tamaki K.

Hayashi H. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). After the phosphorylation, Smad2 and Smad3 oligomerize with common mediator Smad4, and this complex translocates to the nucleus (37Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). To confirm the proper activation of adenovirally expressed HA-tagged Smads, we first analyzed the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 after TGF-β treatment by Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies against phospho-Smad2 and phospho-Smad1, which cross-reacts with phosphorylated Smad3 (28Piek E.

Stopa M. ten Dijke P. Gressner A.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Human gingival fibroblasts were infected with RAdSmad2 and RAdSmad3 and treated with TGF-β (5 ng/ml) for different periods of time, as indicated (Fig. 1 B). Adenovirally produced HA-Smad2 and endogenous Smad2 could not be distinguished on SDS-PAGE (not shown). Therefore, to confirm the activation of adenovirally expressed Smad2, HA-tagged Smad2 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of RAdSmad2-infected cells followed by Western blot analysis. Phosphorylation of HA-Smad2 was detected after 30- and 60-min TGF-β treatment (Fig. 1 B). Adenovirally expressed HA-Smad3 was phosphorylated 30 min after TGF-β treatment, and the phosphorylation was maximal after 60 min of TGF-β treatment (Fig. 1 B). Adenovirally expressed HA-Smad3 and endogenous Smad3 were separated on SDS-PAGE, the upper bands representing adenovirally produced HA-Smad3 and the lower bands representing endogenous Smad3 (Fig. 1 B). The activation of the endogenous and adenovirally expressed Smad3 appeared with similar kinetics (Fig. 1 B). For examination of the nuclear translocation of HA-Smad2, HA-Smad3, and HA-Smad4, human gingival fibroblasts were infected with the corresponding RAdSmads, treated with TGF-β for 2 h, and stained with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 C, in untreated cells, adenovirally expressed HA-tagged Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 were located predominantly in the cytoplasm, but after a 2-h TGF-β treatment, HA staining was detected in the nucleus. Together, these results indicate that infection of cells with RAdSmad2, RAdSmad3, and RadSmad4 results in production of the corresponding functional Smad proteins, which are phosphorylated and subsequently translocated to the nucleus upon TGF-β treatment. We have previously noted that TGF-β induces the expression of MMP-13 in human gingival and fetal skin fibroblasts and that this requires the activity of p38 MAPK (5Ravanti L. Häkkinen L. Larjava H.

Crombleholme T. Foschi M. Han J. Kähäri V.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1098-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the activation of p38 alone or in combination with ERK1/2 is not sufficient to induce the expression of MMP-13 in these cells, suggesting that additional signaling pathways are involved (5Ravanti L. Häkkinen L. Larjava H. Saarialho-Kere U. Foschi M. Han J. Kähäri V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 6Ravanti L.

To elucidate the roles of Smad2 and Smad3 in this context, we infected human gingival fibroblasts with RAdSmad2 and RAdSmad3 and treated the cells with TGF-β. In accordance with our previous findings (5Ravanti L. Häkkinen L. Larjava H. Saarialho-Kere U. Foschi M. Han J. Kähäri V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), a 24-h treatment of gingival fibroblasts with TGF-β resulted in induction of the expression of MMP-13 mRNAs, as compared with untreated cells (Fig.2 A). Infection of cells with empty control virus RAd66 slightly reduced the TGF-β-elicited induction of MMP-13 mRNA levels (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, the expression of MMP-13 mRNAs was markedly (by 22-fold) enhanced by Smad3 overexpression after 24-h TGF-β treatment, as compared with"

ASP administration results in more rapid postprandial lipid clearance. In mice, C3 (the precursor to ASP) knockout results in ASP deficiency and leads to reduced body fat and leptin levels. The protective potential of ASP deficiency against obesity and involvement of the leptin pathway were examined in ob/ob C3(−/−) double knockout mice (2KO). Compared with age-matched ob/ob mice, 2KO mice had delayed postprandial triglyceride and fatty acid clearance; associated with decreased body weight (4–17 weeks age: male: −13.7%, female: −20.6%, p < 0.0001) and HOMA (homeostasis model assessment) index (−37.7%), suggesting increased insulin sensitivity. By contrast, food intake in 2KO mice was +9.1% higher overob/ob mice (p < 0.001, 2KO 5.1 ± 0.2 g/day, ob/ob 4.5 ± 0.2 g/day, wild type 2.6 ± 0.1 g/day). The hyperphagia/leanness was balanced by a 28.5% increase in energy expenditure (oxygen consumption: 2KO, 131 ± 8.9 ml/h; ob/ob, 102 ± 4.5 ml/h; p< 0.01; wild type, 144 ± 8.9 ml/h).

This occurs via translocation of glucose transporters (GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4) from intracellular sites to the cell surface (3Tao Y.Z. Cianflone K. Sniderman A.D. Colby-Germinario S.P.

In addition, ASP has been shown to inhibit hormone-sensitive lipase in adipocytes, independently and additively to insulin (9Van Harmelen V. Reynisdottir S. Cianflone K. Degerman E. Hoffstedt J. Nilsell K. Sniderman A.D. Arner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18243-18251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). There is a differentiation-dependent increase in ASP binding and ASP response in adipocytes (1Cianflone K. Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The major site of action of ASP is adipocytes, as determined by competitive binding, stimulation of triglyceride synthesis, enhanced glucose transport, and transporter translocation (6Kalant D. Zhang Z.J. Cianflone K. Sniderman A.D. Clin. Invest. Med. 1995; 18: B10Google Scholar). ASP is identical to C3adesArg, a cleavage product of complement C3. Cleavage of complement C3 is mediated through the alternate complement pathway via the interaction of C3, factor B, and adipsin that generates C3a. Rapid cleavage of the C-terminal arginine of C3a by carboxypeptidase N generates ASP (10Hugli T.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 153: 181-208PubMed Google Scholar). Adipocytes are one of the few cells capable of producing all three factors (factor B, adipsin, and C3) that are required for the production of ASP (11Cianflone K. Roncari D.A.K. Maslowska M. Baldo A. Forden J. Sniderman A.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9489-9495Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). ASP production increases consequent to adipocyte differentiation (13Cianflone K. Maslowska M. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 25: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and plasma ASP levels are elevated in obesity (14Cianflone K. Sniderman A.D. Kalant D. Marliss E.B. Gougeon R. Int.

Summers L.K.M. Cianflone K. Fielding B.A. Sniderman A.D. Frayn K.N. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 884-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The postprandial increase in ASP is adipose tissue specific and is not observed in the general circulation (19Charlesworth J.A. Peake P.W. Campbell L.V. Pussell B.A. O'Grady S. Tzilopoulos T. Int. J. Obes. Rel. Metab. Dis. 1998; 22: 1096-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data suggest that ASP and lipid storage are metabolically intertwined. ASP acts as an adipocyte autocrine factor and we propose that it plays a central role in the metabolism of adipose tissue by increasing the efficiency of triglyceride synthesis in adipocytes, an action that results in more rapid postprandial lipid clearance (20Cianflone K. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 155: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As ASP is derived through cleavage of complement C3, C3 knockout mice are necessarily deficient in ASP. We have previously demonstrated that genetic deficiency of ASP leads to reduced body fat and decreased leptin levels (21Murray I. Havel P.J. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K.

To determine the influence of the leptin pathway on ASP action and obesity resistance, we examined the effect of ASP deficiency inob/ob mice, which are leptin-deficient. The ob/obmice have been used to test for protection from obesity in a number of double knockout models, such as the ob/ob VLDL receptor(−/−) or the ob/ob PAI-1(−/−). In most cases, the decrease in weight, which was evident in the single knockout, was enhanced when examined on the background of the ob/ob obese mouse model (24Yagyu H. Lutz E.P. Kako Y. Marks S.

Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11753) Google Scholar) and is involved in the regulation of body fat stores. Leptin is critically involved in the regulation of body energy balance via its central actions on food intake and energy expenditure (27Havel P.J. Am. J. Clin.

It is well known that leptin acts via a receptor in the hypothalamus, while there is little evidence that ASP acts via this route. However, leptin also appears to have peripheral actions on substrate fluxes in the adipose tissue (28Brazilai N. Wang J. Massilon D. Vuguin P. Hawkins M. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3105-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and may act directly on adipocytes, where it has been reported to increase lipolysis and impair insulin-mediated lipogenesis (29Muller G.

Commun. 1997; 240: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Finally, leptin production is regulated by insulin responses to meals (31Havel P.H. Twonsend R. Chaump L. Teff K. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), an effect that appears to involve increased adipocyte glucose metabolism (32Mueller W.M. Gregoire F.M. Stanhope K.C.

Leptin and ASP contrast both in their function and major site of action; however both alter energy disposition through altering either storage or oxidation and the aim of this paper was to determine how the absence of leptin coupled to ASP deficiency alters fat metabolism. The leptin and complement C3 double knockout (2KO) mouse strain was generated by crossing the Leptin (+/−) mice (C57Bl/6, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) with complement C3 knockout (C3−/−) (129/Sv genetic background) (previously obtained from Dr. Harvey Coulton) to generate (Leptin+/−, C3+/−) mice. The mixed genetic background mice were bred to generate Leptin(+/−) C3(−/−), Leptin(+/−) C3(+/+). These leptin(+/−) heterozygous mice were used to generate ob/ob C3(−/−) 2KO mice as well as ob/ob C3 (+/+) and wild type mice. All the mice studied were of a mixed genetic background but littermates were used. Mice were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility, 21 °C, 12/12 h light cycle, and fed regular rodent chow food. All procedures on mice followed the guidelines established by the CACC and were approved by the Royal Victoria Hospital Animal Care Committee. The mice were selected by genotyping with PCR as described previously for C3 (21Murray I. Havel P.J. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K.

Sci. 1998; 48: 103-104PubMed Google Scholar). Mice tail tips were collected when the mice were weaned at 3 weeks of age. Tails were digested with 750 ul of digestion buffer (500 μm Tris, 50 μm EDTA, 0.004% SDS, 40 mm NaCl, 0.028% proteinase K, pH 8.5) at 56 °C overnight with mild rotation. Samples were centrifuged (14,000 ×g, 5 min). To the supernatant was added 600 ul of isopropyl alcohol followed by centrifugation for 1 min at 14,000 ×g to isolate the DNA pellet. The DNA was washed with 70% ethanol and then re-dissolved in 50 ul of Tris/EDTA buffer. For PCR, 1 ul of DNA was used. The primers used for ob/ob mice genotyping were: Sn, 5′-TGACCTGGAGAATCTCC-3′ and Asn, 5′-CATCCAGGCTCTCTGGC-3′ for the wild type leptin gene and Sn, 5′-TGACCTGGAGAATCTCC-3′ and Asn, 5′-TGACCTGGAGAATCTCT-3′ for the mutated leptin gene. PCR conditions were: 10 μm each leptin primer, 200 μmdNTP, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm TMAC amplified for 35 cycles of 94 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min. For detection of the C3 gene: Sn, 5′-CTTAACTGTCCCACTGCCAAGAAACCGTCCCAGATC-3′ and Asn, 5′-CTCTGGTCCCTCCCTGTTCCTGCACCAGGGACTGCCCAAAATTTCGCAAC-3′ were used for the wild type complement C3 gene, and Sn, 5′-ATCGCATCGAGCGAGCACGTACTCGGA-3′ and Asn, 5′-AGCTCTTCAGCAATATCACGGGTATCC-3′ were used for neomycin detection in the complement C3 knockout mice. The PCR condition for genotyping were: 32 μm each primer, 200 μm dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2 for 35 cycles of 94 °C, 1 min; 67 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min. All of the recruited mice had body weight determined every week and food intake was measured every 2 days from the 4th week to the 17th week of age. Fat loads were done as a crossover design experiment. 2KO mice were divided into 2 groups. When the mice were 14 weeks old, a fat load was given to 2KO mice (half with ASP injection and half without ASP injection), as well as wild type mice (male and female) and ob/ob mice (male and female). After an overnight fast (16 h), 400 ul of olive oil (followed by 100 ul of air above the oil) was administrated by gastric gavage using a feeding tube (12-cm curved ball tipped feeding needle (34Circolo A.

Blood (40 ul) was collected at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h by tail bleeding. Where indicated, ASP was injected intraperitoneally at the time of the fat load. ASP was purified and injected as described previously. Each mouse received intraperitoneally either sterile ASP (500 μg) dissolved in 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) or sterile vehicle (same solution without ASP). Previous experiments have demonstrated that injection of the vehicle solution (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, 300 μl) had no effect of postprandial TG clearance in the mice compared with the same mice without vehicle as shown previously (21Murray I. Havel P.J. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Murray I. Sniderman A.D. Havel P.J. Cianflone K. J. Biol.

When the mice were 16 weeks old, a fat load was given to the 2KO mice again, but the groups were switched. The remaining wild type mice and ob/ob mice were given fat loads at the same time. Blood was collected as before. Blood was collected at 14 weeks (for fasting lipids and glucose), 16 weeks (for fat load test), and 22 weeks (to measure insulin) into EDTA-containing tubes by tail bleeding from mice fasted overnight (16 h) with water ad libitum. Blood was separated by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Fasting insulin was measured using a rat insulin RIA kit (Linco Inc., St. Charles, MO, cat. RI-13K), which has 100% cross-reactivity to mouse insulin (as described by the manufacturer, Linco Research, Inc.). Glucose was measured using a Trinder glucose kit (Sigma). Plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and triglyceride were measured using colorimetric enzymatic kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval, Canada). Oxygen consumption and CO2 production were measured using the Columbus Instrument Oxymax System (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Each mouse was measured individually over 4 h in a resting state at 21 °C in the absence of food and water. Five time points were sampled, and the experiment was repeated the following day. The average value was used in the analysis. All results are presented as average ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were by Student'st test, ANOVA, 2-way ANOVA, or Pearson Correlation as indicated in the text and figure legends. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05, where p ns indicates not significant. We first examined body weight in these double knockoutob/ob C3(−/−) (2KO) mice. Compared with theob/ob mice of the same age, 2KO have lower body weight. As shown in Fig. 1, this is especially pronounced during the 4–12 week age group. Over the total time (4–17 weeks) there was a 13.7% reduction of body weight in the males, and a 20.6% reduction in the females (both p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1). The effect was the same in male and female mice. In ASP-deficient mice, we have previously demonstrated a delayed postprandial triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) clearance following a fat load in the male mice (21Murray I. Havel P.J. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Murray I. Sniderman A.D. Havel P.J. Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36219-36225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and we also examined these parameters in the mice. Despite their pronounced obesity, the ob/ob mice have a similar NEFA profile to the wild type mice (Fig. 2). However, while the fasting NEFA levels were no different in 2KO mice, they demonstrate clearly a delayed postprandial NEFA clearance compared with both theob/ob group and the wild type group (Fig. 2,p < 0.01 by 2-way ANOVA for 2KO versus wild type). Intraperitoneal administration of ASP restored a normal NEFA clearance pattern. Similar changes were demonstrated in the triglyceride profiles (as shown in Fig.3) where again the ob/ob mice had a relatively normal postprandial triglyceride clearance, which is markedly delayed in the 2KO mice (p < 0.01). Interestingly, the delayed NEFA and triglyceride clearance in the 2KO mice were present in both male and female mice, a difference from previous studies in ASP-deficient mice, where only the male mice demonstrated delayed triglyceride clearance (21Murray I. Havel P.J. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Murray I. Sniderman A.D. Havel P.J. Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36219-36225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Figure 3Both male and female 2KO mice had delayed postprandial triglyceride clearance compared with ob/obmice or wild type mice. The ob/ob mice had a profile similar to the wild type mice (p value NS) while the 2KO were significantly different (p < 0.01). Values are shown as mean ± S.E. for n = 6 per group. The data were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In addition to lipids, we also measured fasting insulin and glucose in the three groups of mice. The obesity in ob/ob mice is usually associated with increased plasma insulin and glucose, as quantitated by the HOMA index (the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, Ref. 12Matthews D.R. Hosker J.P. Rudenski A.S. Naylor B.A. Treacher D.F. Turner R.C. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (25640) Google Scholar) and this is also shown here. There was no difference in fasting or postprandial glucose between 2KO andob/ob. The fasting glucose was: 2KO 4.1 ± 0.7 mm; ob/ob 4.0 ± 0.5 mm; wild type 4.0 ± 0.4 mm. However the 2KO mice had lower insulin levels and a significantly lower HOMA index (−37.7%) as compared with ob/ob mice (Fig.4, inset, wild type: 2.7 ± 0.5 mm·milliunits/liter, ob/ob 15.8 ± 2.4 mm·milliunits/liter, and 2KO: 9.8 ± 1.5 mm·milliunits/liter, p < 0.05), suggesting greater insulin sensitivity in the 2KO mice compared with the ob/ob. These changes in HOMA and in insulin are very closely related to the decrease in body weight in the 2KO as shown in Fig. 4 A. Again, both male and female 2KO mice were equally improved in this respect. The analysis of food intake is shown in Fig.5 A (inset). Strikingly, although body weight is decreased in the 2KO compared with the ob/ob mice, the 2KO mice actually ingest a greater caloric amount. In the 2KO group, food intake was 5.3 ± 0.2 g/day, whereas it was 4.7 ± 0.2 g/day in the ob/ob and only 2.6 ± 0.1 g/day in the wild type mice (2KO +9.1% increaseversus ob/ob, p < 0.001; +95% increase versus wild type, p < 0.001). This increase in food intake was seen in both males and females. Thus the decreased body weight is not a result of decreased daily food intake. Consequently, 2KO mice have a significantly reduced food efficiency index: for a 1-g increase in body weight 2KO consume 17.5 ± 1.3 g of food, while the ob/ob consume 13.0 ± 0.8 g of food, p < 0.01. This parameter (food efficiency) is significantly correlated with HOMA (Fig.4 B). The interesting phenomenon that the 2KO mice ate more food thanob/ob mice daily, but gain less weight suggests that there are important alterations in energy expenditure and disposition. This was examined by measuring oxygen consumption (VO2) and CO2production in the 3 groups of mice (2KO, ob/ob, and wild type). The results demonstrate that the ob/ob mice have lower oxygen consumption than wild type mice, while oxygen consumption in 2KO mice is almost restored to the same level as the wild type group (wild type, 144.3 ± 9.1 ml/h; ob/ob, 102.1 ± 7.6 ml/h; 2KO, 131.2 ± 7.7 ml/h; +28.5% versus ob/ob, p < 0.01; Fig. 5 B inset). A similar result was obtained for heat production (wild type, 0.64 ± 0.04 Kcal/h; ob/ob, 0.48 ± 0.03 Kcal/h; 2KO, 0.62 ± 0.03 Kcal/h; +28.8% versus ob/ob,p < 0.01;). These parameters both correlated negatively with body weight (as shown for oxygen consumption, Fig.5 B). Oxygen consumption was also significantly correlated with food efficiency (Fig. 5 A) and HOMA index (not shown). On the other hand, while the RQ (respiratory quotient) was significantly increased in the ob/ob mice compared with the wild type mice indicating an increase in the proportion of carbohydrateversus fat oxidized, it was not further changed in the 2KO mice. These results extend our knowledge of the role of ASP in energy storage and energy expenditure. Firstly, ASP-deficient ob/obmice demonstrate delayed postprandial triglyceride and NEFA clearance, as demonstrated previously in ASP deficient male mice (21Murray I. Havel P.J. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Murray I. Sniderman A.D. Havel P.J. Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36219-36225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Note that this is not only seen in the males (as described before), but in the 2KO mice this is also evident in females. In both cases, for ASP-deficient or 2KO mice, administration of ASP normalizes the postprandial profile. In addition, HOMA was significantly reduced suggesting that the metabolic changes induced by ASP deficiency lead to increased insulin sensitivity. The very close association between the body weight and HOMA index suggests that it is the decreased weight that results in increased insulin sensitivity. In the present study we demonstrate increases in food intake and basal metabolic rate in double knockout mice, without any changes in RQ (respiratory quotient). The 9% increase in food intake is more than offset by a 28% increase in energy consumption (oxygen consumption) resulting in an overall decrease in body weight of 17% as compared with the ob/ob mice. The first result of interest to address is the increase in food intake. Previously we demonstrated that in C3(−/−) mice, food intake increased but the mice were leaner. This was coupled to a decrease in adipose tissue mass and decreased circulating leptin levels. This led us to speculate that the increased food intake was a consequence of decreased levels of the satiety factor leptin. However, in the present 2KO mice, the 2KO have a greater food intake than the ob/obmice, a finding that cannot be explained by a decreased leptin, since leptin is absent in both mice. This suggests that the increase in food intake caused by ASP deficiency is not mediated through the leptin pathway. Could ASP or C3a have a satiety effect that is lost in the ASP-deficient and 2KO mice strains? The effects of both ASP (C3adesArg) and C3a have been tested both centrally and peripherally. While there were acute effects on food intake, two studies demonstrated an increase (39Saleh J. Blevins J.E. Havel P.J. Barrett J.A. Gietzen D.W. Cianflone K. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2001; 25: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Schupf N. Williams C.A. Hugli T.E. Cox J. J. Neuroimmunol. 1983; 5: 305-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the other a decrease (41Ohinata K. Inui A. Asakawa A. Wada K. Wada E. Yoshikawa M. Peptides. 2002; 23: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Neither effect was pronounced and disappeared quite rapidly. Likely the effect of ASP deficiency on food intake is not a direct one. The second intriguing finding was the increase in basal metabolic rate (BMR) that was quite pronounced in the 2KO mice. The increase in BMR cannot simply be a consequence of hyperphagia, since theob/ob also overeat, but their BMR is substantially lower than normal. Similarly, the change in BMR cannot simply be due to a lack of leptin, since both mutant mice are lacking leptin. Thus the change in BMR must relate (directly or indirectly) to a lack of ASP (as discussed below). ob/ob have an increased RQ relative to wild type, with an increased shift toward carbohydrate oxidation, probably derived from the high carbohydrate content in the chow diet (46Hwa J.J. Fawzi A.B. Graziano M.P. Ghibaudi L. Williams P. Van Heek M. Davis H. Rudinski M. Sybertz E. Strader C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: R1204-R1209PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that leptin acts not only as a satiety factor but also up-regulates energy utilization (42Breslow M.J. Min-Lee K. Brown D.R. Chacko V.P. Palmer D. Berkowitz D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E443-E449PubMed Google Scholar, 43Marti A. Novo F.J. Martinez-Anso E. Zaratiegui M. Aguado M. Martinez J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Strader C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: R1204-R1209PubMed Google Scholar), and preferentially increases oxidation of fat in a dose dependent manner (47Niskanen L. Haffner S. Karhunen L.J. Turpeinen A.K. Miettinen H. Uusitupa M.I. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1997; 21: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the absence of leptin, energy metabolism shifts toward carbohydrate oxidation. On the other hand, while ASP deficiency induced increases in food intake and BMR, there was no change in RQ compared with ob/ob. Thus the increased oxidation in 2KO mice is an increase in both carbohydrate and fat oxidation. This increase in carbohydrate oxidation and glycolysis may help to explain the increase in insulin sensitivity. What is the mechanism for the increased BMR without a change in RQ in the 2KO? Contributions to BMR can be quantified in terms of oxygen consumption, ATP turnover or uncoupling. About 90% of mammalian oxygen consumption is used by the mitochondria; of this about 20% is uncoupled by the mitochondrial proton leak (through UCP), whereas the other 80% is coupled to ATP synthesis (48Rolfe D.F. Brown G.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 731-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Through proton leaks in the mitochondria, energy is expended without the generation of ATP resulting in heat production. Over the last decade, there has been considerable interest in the role of UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 in mediating this thermogenesis (49Argyropoulos G. Harper M.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 2187-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Increased expression of UCP is associated with increased energy expenditure. Certainly one mechanism by which leptin increases energy expenditure is through stimulation of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue (50Commins S.P. Watson P.M. Padgett M.A. Dudley A. Argyropoulos G. Gettys T.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However an equally important mechanism of energy expenditure which generates heat through the utilization of ATP is termed substrate cycling. A substrate cycle exists when opposing, non-equilibrium reactions catalyzed by different enzymes are operating simultaneously (for review see (51Newsholme E.A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1978; 43: 183-205PubMed Google Scholar, 52Newsholme E.A. Crabtree B. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1976; 41: 61-109PubMed Google Scholar)). At least one of the reactions must involve the hydrolysis of ATP. Thus, a substrate cycle both liberates heat and increases energy expenditure; yet there is no net conversion of substrate to product. One example of a substrate cycle is the simultaneous breakdown (lipolysis) and re-synthesis (re-esterification) of triglyceride (triglyceride-fatty acid cycling). Other substrate cycles in the pathways of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis also exist (such as the glucose/glucose-6-phosphate cycle, the fructose-1-phosphate/fructose-1,6-diphosphate cycle, and the phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate/oxaloacetate). Substrate cycles have been proposed to be important not only in thermogenesis but also in maintaining the sensitivity and flexibility of metabolic regulation (48Rolfe D.F. Brown G.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 731-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Substrate cycling occurs primarily in the liver, muscle and adipose tissue (48Rolfe D.F. Brown G.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 731-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). While 20% of total mitochondrial energy is expended via proton leaks (as mentioned above), it has been estimated that a further 20% is expended in substrate cycling (48Rolfe D.F. Brown G.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 731-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Newsholme (53Newsholme E.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 302: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) estimated that if the fructose-1-phosphate/fructose-1,6-diphosphate cycle was fully active, it could account for ∼50% of an adult human's daily energy expenditure. Of particular interest to the present discussion is the triglyceride-fatty acid cycle, which is highly active in adipose tissue. In humans the activity of this cycle ranges enormously from 0 to 100% re-esterification of released fatty acids (54Hammond V.A. Johnston D.G. Metabolism. 1987; 36: 308-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and is regulated through environmental (diet, exercise) (55Tagliaferro A.R. Dobbin S. Curi R. Leighton B. Meeker L.D. Newsholme E.A. Int. J. Obes. 1990; 14: 957-971PubMed Google Scholar), anatomic (gender and adipose tissue site) (56Mattacks C.A. Pond C.M. Int. J. Obes. 1988; 12: 585-597PubMed Google Scholar), and hormonal influences (57Miyoshi H. Shulman G.I. Peters E.J. Wolfe M.H. Elahi D. Wolfe R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1545-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A number of hormones, such as norepinephrine and insulin have been shown to modulate the triglyceride/fatty acid cycle in adipose tissue, as well as other substrate cycles in additional tissues (56Mattacks C.A. Pond C.M. Int. J. Obes. 1988; 12: 585-597PubMed Google Scholar, 57Miyoshi H. Shulman G.I. Peters E.J. Wolfe M.H. Elahi D. Wolfe R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1545-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In a recent paper, Reidy and Weber (5Reidy S.P. Weber J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E312-E317Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) proposed that accelerated triglyceride/fatty acid substrate cycling in adipose tissue provides a new mechanism by which leptin triggers increased metabolic rate. Leptin is thought to increase energy expenditure primarily by driving the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis to produce more triiodothyronine (T3), a key regulator of standard metabolic rate. T3 in turn increases the expression of uncoupling proteins to reduce the efficiency of ATP production and increase heat. However leptin was also shown to directly activate the triglyceride/fatty acid cycle, lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, shifting fuel preference from carbohydrate to fat oxidation. Thus, in ob/ob mice, the loss of leptin stimulation of UCP1 and triglyceride/fatty acid cycling will simultaneously contribute to the decrease in energy expenditure and the increase in fat storage. Does ASP influence uncoupling proteins and substrate cycling? Since ASP is known to increase triglyceride synthesis and re-esterification (9Van Harmelen V. Reynisdottir S. Cianflone K. Degerman E.

Although the presence of a repair system to remove this damage has been demonstrated, the mechanisms involved in this repair have not been well defined. In an effort to better understand the physiological role of recombinant 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/apurinic lyase (OGG1) in mtDNA repair, we constructed an expression vector containing the gene for OGG1 downstream of the mitochondrial localization sequence from manganese-superoxide dismutase. This gene construct was placed under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter. Transfected cells that conditionally expressed OGG1 in the absence of the tetracycline analogue doxycycline and targeted this recombinant protein to mitochondria were generated. Western blots of mitochondrial extracts from vector- and OGG1-transfected clones with and without doxycycline revealed that removal of doxycycline for 4 days caused an approximate 8-fold increase in the amount of OGG1 protein in mitochondria. Enzyme activity assays and DNA repair studies showed that the doxycycline-dependent recombinant OGG1 is functional. Functional studies revealed that cells containing recombinant OGG1 were more proficient at repairing oxidative damage in their mtDNA, and this increased repair led to increased cellular survival following oxidative stress.

Free Radic. Res. 1998; 29: 573-579Google Scholar). The damage to mtDNA that leads to these mutations likely results from exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS). These noxious agents are formed continuously in the mitochondria by electron leakage from the respiratory chains. Although oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria is essential for producing the energy that is required to sustain life, approximately 1–2% of the total oxygen processed by the electron transport chains is reduced via one electron reduction to form ROS such as superoxide. Therefore, mtDNA, which is located near the electron transport chains, is continuously bombarded with these noxious agents. Although there are substantial antioxidant defenses in mitochondria to protect against the deleterious effects of ROS, damage to mtDNA still occurs. Therefore, efficient repair mechanisms are imperative to prevent these lesions from becoming permanent mutations. Over the past decade, there have been substantial advances in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the repair of oxidative damage in mtDNA. Work from our laboratory and that of others has established that repair of this damage is via a base excision repair (BER) pathway (13Bogenhagen D.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1276-1281Google Scholar, 14Sawyer D.E. Van Houten B. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 161-176Google Scholar, 15Croteau D.L. Stierum R.H. Bohr V.A. Mutat.

In support of this notion is the finding that mitochondria contain the basic enzymes required for BER (17Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Google Scholar, 18Stierum R.H. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3712-3719Google Scholar), including the glycosylase/AP lyase OGG1, which is necessary for the initial steps in the removal of the mutagenic lesion 8-oxoguanine. Because of its lyase activity, this enzyme may also play a role in cleaning the 3′ end of oxidative lesions to the sugar-phosphate backbone. The human OGG1 gene encodes two major isoforms: α-hOGG1 and β-hOGG1, resulting from alternative splicing of the transcript (19Aburatani H. Hippo Y. Ishida T. Takashima R. Matsuba C. Kodama T. Takao M. Yasui A. Yamamoto K. Asano M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2151-2156Google Scholar, 20Takao M. Aburatani H. Kobayashi K. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2917-2922Google Scholar, 21Nishioka K. Ohtsubo T. Oda H. Fujiwara T. Kang D. Sugimachi K. Nakabeppu Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1637-1652Google Scholar). Both forms have a putative mitochondrial localization signal, and only α-hOGG1 has a nuclear localization signal (21Nishioka K. Ohtsubo T. Oda H. Fujiwara T. Kang D. Sugimachi K. Nakabeppu Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1637-1652Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that β-hOGG1 is targeted to mitochondria. The importance of the Ogg1 DNA glycosylase in the repair of oxidative damage was shown in Ogg1-deficient mice. These animals accumulate abnormally high levels of 8-OxoG in their genomes (22Klungland A. Rosewell I. Hollenbach S. Larsen E. Daly G. Epe B. Seeberg E. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13300-13305Google Scholar). Furthermore, no cleavage of 8-oxoG:C-containing substrate was detected in tissue extracts from Ogg1 knockout mice, indicating that OGG1 is the only mammalian glycosylase that can efficiently remove 8-OxoG from 8-oxoG:C pairs. These findings correlate well with previous data on the substrate specificity of the murine and human OGG1 enzyme (23Roldan-Arjona T. Wei Y.F. Carter K.C. Klungland A. Anselmino C. Wang R.P. Augustus M. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8016-8020Google Scholar, 24Zharkov D.O. Rosenquist T.A. Gerchman S.E. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28607-28617Google Scholar). Although extracts of Ogg1-null mouse tissues were not able to excise the damaged base in vitro, significant slow release of the adducted base was observed from proliferating cells in vivo, suggesting that there is an alternative repair pathway in those cells (22Klungland A. Rosewell I. Hollenbach S. Larsen E. Daly G. Epe B. Seeberg E. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13300-13305Google Scholar). More recently, studies were reported by Bohr et al.(25Bohr V.A. Stevnsner T. de Souza-Pinto N.C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 127-134Google Scholar) that used Ogg1-null mice to show that OGG1 is more important in mitochondrial than in nuclear DNA repair of oxidative damage (22Klungland A. Rosewell I. Hollenbach S. Larsen E. Daly G. Epe B. Seeberg E. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13300-13305Google Scholar). Based on these studies, it is likely that OGG1 is the only glycosylase for 8-OxoG removal in mouse mitochondria. Additionally, it was found that mitochondrial OGG1 activity increased with age in the mouse liver (26de Souza-Pinto N.C. Eide L. Hogue B.A. Thybo T. Stevnsner T. Seeberg E. Klungland A. Bohr V.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5378-5381Google Scholar), whereas the nuclear OGG1 activity decreased slightly over the same time interval. This differential change with age in the mitochondrial and nuclear 8-OxoG glycosylase activities suggests that the expression of these two isoforms may be differentially regulated. When considered together, these findings indicate that BER initiated by OGG1 is an essential enzyme required for protection of mtDNA against oxidative damage. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that mitochondrial DNA repair and cellular survival can be enhanced by targeting recombinant OGG1 to mitochondria (27Dobson A.W. Xu Y. Kelley M.R. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37518-37523Google Scholar). However, to fully evaluate the potential of using recombinant repair enzymes to alter mtDNA repair, it would be very beneficial to have their expression under the control of an inducible promoter. The tetracycline (Tet)-regulatable expression system using control elements of the tetracycline resistance operon encoded in Tn10 of Escherichia coli (28Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Google Scholar) has shown promise for conditional gene expression. This system relies on the presence or absence of Tet or a commonly used analog, doxycyclin (Dox), to control gene expression. For this study, we constructed a vector containing the sequence for hOGG1 downstream of the manganese-superoxide dismutase mitochondrial targeting sequence under the control of the Tet-response element and introduced it into HeLa cells transfected previously with pTet-Off plasmid. When hOGG1 was conditionally expressed, we investigated the level and location of the recombinant protein and its effect on mtDNA repair and cell survival following exposure to ROS. The results demonstrate that DNA repair proteins can be conditionally expressed under the control of an inducible promoter and targeted to mitochondria. The Tet-dependent overexpression of OGG1 causes enhanced repair of oxidative damage to mtDNA and increased cellular resistance to the lethal effects of ROS. An EcoRI-XhoI fragment containing the MTS and the OGG1 coding region (27Dobson A.W. Xu Y. Kelley M.R. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37518-37523Google Scholar) was filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase and ligated into thePvuII restriction site of the pTRE2hyg expression vector (Clontech), which contained a tetracycline-responsive element. The construct obtained was sequenced to verify the integrity of the reading frame and the fidelity of the sequence. HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were transfected with pTet-Off plasmid (Clontech) using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Stable transfectants were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Clontech), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 800 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin), and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). Integration of the pTet-Off plasmid was confirmed by PCR, and expression of the Tet-dependent transactivator (tTa) was tested using the luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml Dox hydrocloride (Sigma). Transient transfections with pTRE2hyg/Luc (Clontech) were performed using Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmids pcDNA3.1/His/LacZ (Invitrogen) and pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) containing β-galactosidase or GFP genes under the control of constitutive promoters, respectively, were used as reporter plasmids. The transfection efficiencies were usually >30%, as determined by control transfection with pEGFP-N3. Cells were harvested 48–72 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were assayed. For normalization of transfection efficiency, a control LacZ expression vector (pcDNA3.1/His/LacZ) was used. Luciferase (Luc) values were normalized to β-galactosidase activities by performing chlorophenol red β-d-galactosidase assays (29Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Colberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 11 (742–733): 739-740Google Scholar). Enzyme activities were adjusted to the protein content of the cell lysates, which was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein dye microassay according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Bio-Rad). The clone of HeLa Tet-Off that expressed the lowest basal level of Luc in the presence of Dox and the highest induced level of Luc activity in the absence of the antibiotic was selected for the second transfection with pTRE2hyg/MTS-OGG1 plasmid. A pTRE2hyg vector without the insert was used to transfect Tet-Off HeLa cells as a control. After this second transfection, the colonies were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 800 μg/ml G418 and 250 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen), and the surviving ones were tested for the integration of MTS-OGG1 insert by Southern hybridization. The selected Tet-Off/MTS-OGG1 clones were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Clontech), 800 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin), and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B and with (Dox+) or without (Dox−) 1 μg/ml doxycyclin. Doxycyclin was withdrawn from the medium of Dox-maintained clones 4 days before any experiment. One 150-mm dish of each cell type (MTS-OGG1 and control vector-transfected cells) at confluence was harvested and treated with ice-cold digitonin (325 mm digitonin, 2.5 mmEDTA, 250 mm mannitol, and 17 mm MOPS, pH 7.4) for 80 s. The lysed cells were then added to mannitol-sucrose buffer to a final strength of 1× (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The suspension was then centrifuged for 10 min at 800 ×g at 4 °C to pellet nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged two more times for 10 min at 800 × g at 4 °C to get rid of nuclear debris. The mitochondrial fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Isolated mitochondria were suspended in a buffer of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 300 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 5 μl of protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma) per ml. These suspensions were briefly sonicated on ice and centrifuged once more at 5,000 ×g to pellet any remaining debris, and the supernatant protein was used for Western blot assays. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein dye microassay according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Bio-Rad). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer of separated proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were performed as described previously (27Dobson A.W. Xu Y. Kelley M.R. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37518-37523Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Blocking and antibody immunoblotting were performed in 5% nonfat dry milk and Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). TBS-T and TBS were used for washing. The polyclonal anti-hOGG1 antibodies were from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO); anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody was purchased from Pharmingen. Complexes formed by these antibodies were detected with horse radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Promega, Madison, WI) using chemiluminescent reagents (SuperSignal, Pierce). A 24-mer oligonucleotide with 8-oxoguanine at the 10th position (Trevigen) was end-labeled. The labeling reaction contained 5 pmol of single-strand 8-oxoguanine oligonucleotide, 5 pmol of γ-32P, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and appropriate kinase buffer in a total volume of 20 μl (incubation for 30 min at 37 °C followed by 2 min at 90 °C). Complementary oligonucleotide (5 pmol) was then added at room temperature to form duplex DNA. Equal amounts of protein from mitochondrial fractions isolated from transfected cells grown in medium with or without Dox were used in assays with the labeled duplex oligonucleotide. Activity assays contained 0.2 pmol of labeled duplex oligonucleotide, 3 μl of 10 × REC buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m KCl, 100 mmEDTA, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and organelle extract or 5 units of control formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase enzyme (Trevigen) in a total volume of 20 μl. Reaction mix was incubated for 3 and 6 h at 37 °C. Formamide/bromphenol (80%/0.2%) dye was added to the mix, and reaction products were resolved in 20% acrylamide, 8m urea gels. For oxidative damage and repair experiments, cells were grown in 100-mm dishes for 4 days in medium with or without Dox until 70–80% confluence. Menadione sodium bisulfite (2-methyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone sodium bisulfite, Sigma) was dissolved in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) at a concentration of 800 μm for DNA repair experiments. Cells were rinsed with HBSS and then exposed to the appropriate amount of menadione for 20 min in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Control cultures were exposed to HBSS under the same conditions. After a 20-min exposure, cells were rinsed and lysed immediately (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.3 mg/ml proteinase K) or were allowed to repair for 2 or 6 h in regular growth medium with or without Dox. MTS-OGG-transfected and vector-only transfected cells were exposed to menadione as described above, and cell lysates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. After addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 1 m, high molecular weight DNA was extracted with an equal volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1), precipitated with ammonium acetate and 2 volumes of cold ethanol, and resuspended in water. DNA samples were digested with restriction endonuclease XhoI (10 units/μg of DNA) and, at the same time, treated with DNase-free RNase (∼1.0 μg/ml) for 12–16 h at 37 °C. After digestion, samples were precipitated as before, resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.4), and precisely quantified using a Hoefer TKO 100 Mini-Fluorometer and TKO standards kit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). Samples containing 5 μg of DNA were heated at 65 °C for 20 min and then cooled at room temperature for an additional 20 min. A sodium hydroxide solution was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 n, and samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. This produced single strand breaks at any abasic or sugar-modified site in the DNA. Next, samples were combined with 5 μl of loading dye, loaded onto a 0.6% alkaline agarose gel, and electrophoresed at 30 V (1.5 V/cm of gel length) for ∼16 h in an alkaline buffer consisting of 23 mm NaOH, 1 mmEDTA. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide to confirm equal loading. After standard gel washing, the DNA was transferred to a Zeta-Probe GT nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were cross-linked and hybridized with a 32P-labeled human mtDNA-specific PCR-generated probe. Hybridization and subsequent washes were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA damage and repair were determined as described previously (30Driggers W.J. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22042-22045Google Scholar). Neutral Southern blots were performed the same way except that there was no alkaline pretreatment of samples and NaOH was not included in the loading dye, the 0.6% agarose gel, or the electrophoresis buffer. To confirm integration into the genome of the pTRE2hyg/MTS-OGG1 plasmid, DNA samples were digested with BamHI and HindIII, and hybridization was performed with a 32P-labeled MTS-OGG1 fragment generated using the RadPrime labeling system (Invitrogen). Cells were counted with a hemocytometer, and 250 cells were plated in each 60-mm dish to achieve sparse distribution. These cells were incubated for 24 h in normal culture medium to allow them to adhere to the culture vessel. Next, they were exposed to menadione exactly as described above with the exception that lower concentrations of the drug were used due to the higher sensitivity of cells to oxidative stress when plated at the low density required for the clonogenic assay. For each cell type, controls (no menadione) and cultures receiving various concentrations of menadione were studied in triplicate. After 20 min of treatment, the menadione solution was replaced with normal culture medium (with or without Dox), and cells were grown for 10 days. Then colonies formed were stained with hematoxylin and counted. The data are presented as the means ± standard errors of three independent experiments. Data were compared with the use of two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni analysis. Statistical significance was determined at the 0.001 level. To fully evaluate the potential of using recombinant hOGG1 to alter mtDNA repair, we used HeLa cells transfected with MTS-OGG1 under the control of a Tet-mediated promoter. Initially, HeLa cells were stably transfected with the pTet-Off regulator plasmid. Following 2 weeks of selection, individual clones were isolated, and the integration of the tTa activator was confirmed by PCR amplification. Expression of tTa was checked by Luc assay after transient transfection of Tet-Off clones with a reporter plasmid pTRE2hyg/Luc. Selected clones were grown in the absence and presence of Dox. Clones that expressed the lowest basal level of luciferase and showed the highest induced level (> 50-fold induction) of Luc activity after Dox removal were chosen for the second transfection with the pTRE2hyg/MTS-OGG1 construct or control vector (pTRE2hyg). Double-transfected clones were selected in hygromycin and grown in the presence of Dox. DNA was isolated from cells transfected withMTS-OGG1 or vector only, and the presence of the insert was confirmed in the MTS-OGG1-transfected clones by hybridization with a 1.1-kb fragment containing a partialMTS-OGG1 sequence (Fig. 1). A clone of HeLa Tet-Off/MTS-OGG1–1 was chosen for subsequent study because it exhibited the highest level of MTS-OGG1incorporation into its genome and produced the greatest amount of OGG1 protein in mitochondria after induction (Fig.2).Figure 2Dox-regulated and targeted expression of OGG1 in mitochondria.HeLa Tet-Off/MTS-OGG1-transfected clones were cultured with or without 1 μg/ml Dox for 4 days to regulate OGG1 protein expression. Mitochondrial fractions were isolated and analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-OGG1 antiserum. Twenty μg of mitochondrial extracts isolated from vector- andMTS-OGG1-transfected clones were loaded in each lane. Immunodetection of cytochrome c (CytoC) was performed to assure that the recombinant protein is in mitochondria.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To show that the recombinant OGG1 enzyme was targeted directly to mitochondria and that its expression was regulated by Dox, mitochondrial extracts were isolated from MTS-OGG1and vector-only transfected clones that were grown in media with or without Dox. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation, and Western blots were performed utilizing a polyclonal antibody to human OGG1. Even loading was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining. The Tet-Off/MTS-OGG1–1 Dox− clone showed an increase in OGG1 protein (39 kDA) when compared with Dox+ Tet-Off/MTS-OGG1 repressed cells or vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2). This data confirmed that the recombinant OGG1 enzyme was targeted to mitochondria and that OGG1 gene expression was regulated by Dox. To determine whether the recombinant OGG1 was functional in mitochondria, OGG1 activity assays were performed. A labeled 24-bp duplex oligonucleotide with 8-oxoguanine placed at the 10th position on one strand was incubated with mitochondrial extracts isolated fromMTS-OGG1 and vector-transfected cells. As a positive control, the bacterial glycosylase/AP-lyase formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG) (Trevigen) was used. As shown in Fig.3, the mitochondrial extracts isolated from MTS-OGG1 (Dox−) clones were better able to cleave the DNA substrate than were the same cells grown in the presence of Dox and vector-only transfected cells. Thus, this data reveal that the conditionally expressed recombinant OGG1 protein, which is targeted to mitochondria, is indeed functional. To test whether the conditional overexpression of recombinant hOGG1 in the mitochondria has an effect on mtDNA repair capacity, an analysis of DNA repair was performed. To detect mtDNA damage and repair, a quantitative Southern blot technique was used as described under “Experimental Procedures.” First, dose-response experiments were performed using different concentrations of menadione, which redox-cycles with complex I of the electron transport chains in mitochondria and forms superoxide radical (31Frei B. Winterhalter K.H. Richter C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4438-4443Google Scholar). A concentration of 800 μm menadione was chosen for the repair experiments because it produced an appropriate amount of lesions (∼1 lesion/104 normal nucleotides). There was no significant difference in the initial break frequencies between clones that were grown in the absence or presence of Dox. Repair experiments were performed in which the MTS-OGG1 and vector transfectants were exposed to 800 μm menadione for 20 min and either lysed immediately or allowed to repair for 2 or 6 h in normal culture media with or without Dox. Control cells were incubated in drug diluent only. Total DNA was isolated from the lysed cells, and quantitative Southern blot hybridizations were performed. As shown in Fig.4 A, the MTS-OGG1 (Dox−) clones repaired most of the damage within the initial 6 h following drug removal, whereas the vector transfectants and MTS-OGG1 (Dox+) clones did not repair an appreciable amount of the damage to their mtDNA. The average amount of repair from three separate experiments for each cell type is shown in Fig. 4 B. These results document that recombinant hOGG1, when conditionally overexpressed and targeted to mitochondria, significantly enhances mtDNA repair of oxidative damage. To determine whether the increase in mtDNA repair enhanced cellular survival following oxidative stress, a clonogenic assay was performed. Because sparsely growing cells are more sensitive to menadione than confluent monolayers, for these clonogenic studies we used lower doses of menadione than were required for the DNA repair experiments. Drug exposure and cellular growth in the presence or absence of Dox were performed using techniques described under “Experimental Procedures.” The colonies formed from cells that survived and proliferated following oxidative stress were counted after 10 days of culture. Fig. 5 shows that there is a significant enhancement in survival in the MTS-OGG1 (Dox−) transfectants. These viability data establish that conditional transduction of OGG1 in mitochondria leads to increased cellular survival after an oxidative challenge. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show conditional expression of a recombinant DNA repair enzyme that is targeted to mitochondria. Previous studies by our laboratory showed that when a vector containing the gene for hOGG1 fused to the localization sequence from manganese-superoxide dismutase was stably transfected into HeLa cells, repair of oxidative damage in mtDNA was increased, and cellular survival was enhanced (27Dobson A.W. Xu Y. Kelley M.R. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37518-37523Google Scholar). Although this work provided some important new information concerning repair of oxidative damage in mtDNA, the results had to be interpreted with caution because permanent transfection could have altered the genome of the cell in a manner that influenced the findings. To overcome this problem, the present experiments were initiated to find a “genetic switch” that would allow the control of individual gene products quantitatively and reversibly in a temporal manner. Among the several regulatory systems currently available, the Tet-controlled system for the activation of transcription seemed best suited to fulfill the requirements of our study. Previously, this system has been used for conditional gene expression in mammalian cell culture (38Resnitzky D. Gossen M. Bujard H. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Google Scholar), in transgenic plants (39Weinmann P. Gossen M. Hillen W. Bujard H. Gatz C. Plant J. 1994; 5: 559-569Google Scholar), and in transgenic mice and other transgenic mammalian species (40Kistner A. Gossen M. Zimmermann F. Jerecic J. Ullmer C. Lubbert H. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10933-10938Google Scholar, 41Stebbins M.J. Urlinger S. Byrne G. Bello B. Hillen W. Yin J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10775-10780Google Scholar). HeLa cells were selected for this study because we discovered previously that these cells do not proficiently repair oxidative damage to their mtDNA (27Dobson A.W. Xu Y. Kelley M.R. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37518-37523Google Scholar), and it has been reported that in these cells, the Tet systems exhibit no measurable “intrinsic leakiness” (28Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Google Scholar, 32Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Google Scholar). Repair of oxidative damage in the nucleus of these cells appears to be normal. This makes these cells preferable to cells in whichOGG1 has been knocked out because those cells would be defective in both nuclear and mitochondrial repair. Although the reason that HeLa cells are defective in the repair of oxidative damage in mtDNA has yet to be fully elucidated, we believe a likely explanation is that there is a defect in the formation of the alternatively spliced transcript for mitochondrial localization. In support of this notion is our finding that HeLa cells have low levels of OGG1 protein in their mitochondria. For targeting OGG1 to mitochondria, we used the MTS from manganese-superoxide dismutase because previous work from our laboratory and the studies of others have found this to be a particularly strong MTS that effectively directs other proteins, including repair enzymes, to mitochondria (27Dobson A.W. Xu Y. Kelley M.R. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37518-37523Google Scholar, 33Tamura T. McMicken H.W. Smith C.V. Hansen T.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 659-663Google Scholar, 34Dobson A.W. Grishko V. LeDoux S.P. Kelley M.R. Wilson G.L. Gillespie M.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L205-L210Google Scholar, 35Paul R. Dalibart R. Lemoine S. Lestienne P. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 11-19Google Scholar). We used the Tet-Off system, in which the presence of Dox prevents transcriptional activation, for conditional expression of hOGG1 in mitochondria. This system was used because in the clones we isolated, the amount of hOGG1 that could be produced was greater than that with the Tet-On system. In the presence of Dox, the exogenous recombinant MTS-OGG1 expression in mitochondria was low, and the cells behaved similarly in culture to the HeLa Tet-Off cell line, transfected with vector only. Both the results from enzyme activity assays and DNA repair studies reveal that the Dox-dependent, expressed MTS-OGG1 is functional. The mitochondrial extracts isolated from MTS-OGG1 (Dox−) cells were markedly better able to cleave substrate than the same cells grown with Dox and vector-only transfected cells. Mitochondrial DNA repair studies show that MTS-OGG1 (Dox−) cells were significantly more proficient at repairing oxidative damage in the mitochondrial genome. Combined with the viability studies, it can be concluded that recombinant OGG1 was conditionally expressed under the Dox-inducible promoter and targeted to mitochondria in an active form. Furthermore, it enhanced the repair of oxidative damage to the sugar-phosphate backbone in mtDNA, and this augmented repair rendered the cells more resistant to oxidative stress. Thus, these findings support previous work from our laboratory using cells that constitutively overexpress OGG1 and provide a new opportunity for dissecting the various components of BER in mitochondria. Recently, much attention has been directed toward the identification and characterization of enzymes involved in BER of mtDNA. Initial evidence for a BER mechanism in mitochondria was provided by the isolation of a mammalian mitochondrial endonuclease that specifically recognizes AP sites and cleaves the DNA strand (36Tomkinson A.E. Bonk R.T. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12532-12537Google Scholar). Later, activities of an AP endonuclease, a DNA ligase III, and a DNA polymerase were identified in mitochondrial fractions from Xenopus oocytes (17Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Google Scholar). Additionally, a mitochondrial oxidative damage endonuclease has been isolated from rat liver mitochondria (37Croteau D.L. ap Rhys C.M. Hudson E.K. Dianov G.L. Hansford R.G. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27338-27344Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that mitochondrial oxidative damage endonuclease is a mitochondrial isoform of OGG1 (26de Souza-Pinto N.C. Eide L. Hogue B.A. Thybo T. Stevnsner T. Seeberg E. Klungland A. Bohr V.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5378-5381Google Scholar). Although several of the enzymes involved in mtDNA BER have been identified, a thorough understanding of the exact roles these enzymes play is still incomplete. The results from the present study emphasize the crucial role that hOGG1 plays in the efficient repair of oxidative damage in mtDNA. Future studies will be directed toward the conditional expression of other repair enzymes with glycosylase activity to other oxidative base lesions and lyase activity to better understand the importance of these activities in BER. Of particular interest is a second OGG activity, originally termed OGG2, which has been identified and partially characterized in HeLa cells (42Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Google Scholar). Also of immediate interest are two orthologs of MutM/Nei, which have been identified in the human genome data base and were originally named NEH1 and NEH2 (42Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Google Scholar). Both enzymes have since been renamed as NEIL1 and NEIL2. NEIL1 functions as a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase with broad substrate specificity (42Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Google Scholar), whereas NEIL2 has DNA glycosylase/AP lyase activity, which primarily recognizes oxidized cytosine derivatives (43Hazra T.K. Kow Y.W. Hatahet Z. Imhoff B. Boldogh I. Mokkapati S.K. Mitra S. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30417-30420Google Scholar). The importance of mtDNA integrity for normal cellular homeostasis is only beginning to be appreciated.

https://openalex.org/W1973794764,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and ion transport using ERK1/2 as a downstream effector. Furthermore, the EGF receptor (EGFR) is involved in signaling by G-protein-coupled receptors, growth hormone, and cytokines via transactivation. It has been suggested that steroids interact with peptide hormones. Previously, we have shown that aldosterone modulates EGF responses in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (Gekle, M., Freudinger, R., Mildenberger, S., and Silbernagl, S. (2002) <i>Am. J. Physiol.</i> 282, F669–F679). Here, we tested the hypothesis that human EGFR-1 can confer alternative aldosterone responsiveness with respect to ERK1/2 phosphorylation to Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not express EGFR. Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells did not respond to EGF or aldosterone. After transfection of human EGFR-1, the cells responded to EGF, but not to aldosterone. However, when submaximal concentrations of EGF were used, nanomolar concentrations of aldosterone potentiated the action of EGF within minutes, resulting in a leftward shift of the EGF dose-response curve. This was not the case in mock-transfected cells. The EGFR kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 or the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 completely prevented the effect. Furthermore, aldosterone enhanced Tyr phosphorylation of c-Src and EGFR, and an inhibitor of cytosolic tyrosine kinases (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(<i>t</i>-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-<i>d</i>]pyriociaine) prevented the action of aldosterone. Our data show that aldosterone uses the EGF-EGFR-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling cascade to elicit its alternative effects. In the presence of EGF, aldosterone leads to EGFR transactivation via cytosolic tyrosine kinases of the Src family."
https://openalex.org/W1987954333,"Inhibitor-2 (I-2) bound protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and several PP1-binding proteins from rat brain extracts, including the actin-binding proteins, neurabin I and neurabin II. Neurabins from rat brain lysates were sedimented by I-2 and its structural homologue, I-4. The central domain of both neurabins bound PP1 and I-2, and mutation of a conserved PP1-binding motif abolished neurabin binding to both proteins. Microcystin-LR, a PP1 inhibitor, also attenuated I-2 binding to neurabins. Immunoprecipitation of neurabin I established its association with PP1 and I-2 in HEK293T cells and suggested that PP1 mediated I-2 binding to neurabins. The C terminus of I-2, although not required for PP1 binding, facilitated PP1 recruitment by neurabins, which also targeted I-2 to polymerized F-actin. Mutations that attenuated PP1 binding to I-2 and neurabin I suggested distinct and overlapping sites for these two proteins on the PP1 catalytic subunit. Immunocytochemistry in epithelial cells and cultured hippocampal neurons showed that endogenous neurabin II and I-2 colocalized at actin-rich structures, consistent with the ability of neurabins to target the PP1.I-2 complex to actin cytoskeleton and regulate cell morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2006819428,"The α-helical solenoid proteins adopt a variety of elongated curved structures. They have been examined to identify the interactions that determine their curvature. A sequence pattern characteristic for strongly curved α-helical solenoids has been constructed and was found to match protein sequences containing the proteasome/cyclosome repeats. Based on this, a structural model of the repeat-containing domains of the Rpn1/S2 and Rpn2/S1 proteins, which represent the largest subunits of the 26 S proteasome, has been proposed. The model has a novel architecture resembling an α-helical toroid. Molecular modeling shows that these toroids have a central pore that would allow passage of an unfolded protein substrate through it. This implies that the Rpn1 and Rpn2 toroids are aligned along the common axial pores of the ATPase hexamer and form an “antechamber” of the 26 S proteasome.

An evolutionary link between the PC repeat-containing proteins and tetratricopeptide repeat proteins is proposed. Recently, a new class of protein structures that contain a continuous superhelical or solenoid arrangement of repeating structural units has emerged (1Groves M.R. Barford D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 2Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The solenoid proteins with their elongated and repetitive structure contrast the structure of globular proteins, which fold in more complex ways. The repeating units of the solenoids consist of one to several segments of secondary structure, among which are α-helices, β-strands, and 310-helices. There are purely α-helical or β-structural solenoid proteins and others having a mixture of the secondary structures.The solenoid proteins adopt a variety of non-globular shapes ranging from straight rods to curved shapes resembling a horseshoe. In many instances, the curvature of these proteins predetermines the repertoires of molecules that can bind to them. For example, the α/β-solenoids of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) 1The abbreviations used are: LRR, leucine-rich repeat; APC, anaphase promoting complex; PC, proteasome/cyclosome; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeats; LRV, leucine repeat variant1The abbreviations used are: LRR, leucine-rich repeat; APC, anaphase promoting complex; PC, proteasome/cyclosome; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeats; LRV, leucine repeat variant proteins have a horseshoe shape, and their concave surfaces can embrace certain globular protein domains (3Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the β-solenoids have a rod-like shape, and their binding counterparts themselves may require concave surfaces to bind the β-helices (2Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding of the interactions that control the curvature is important for correct prediction of the structure and function of the solenoid proteins. For some of them, the reasons for the curvature are well established. Indeed, the pronounced curvature of the α/β-solenoids formed by LRRs is the result of different diameters of the α-helices and β-strands when packed in a parallel arrangement (4Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 5Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the purely β-helical structures do not have any curvature because their intercoil distance is determined by the distance between hydrogen-bonded β-strands, which remains the same on all sides of the solenoid (2Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The highest variety of shapes is provided by α-helical solenoids. They can be straight (6Ybe J.A. Brodsky F.M. Hofmann K. Lin K. Liu S.H. Chen L. Earnest T.N. Fletterick R.J. Hwang P.K. Nature. 1999; 399: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), slightly curved (7Peters J.W. Stowell M.H. Rees D.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 991-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), or fold into horseshoe-like structures (8Raag R. Appelt K. Xuong N.H. Banaszak L. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 553-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Groves M.R. Hanlon N. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Cell. 1999; 96: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, the interactions that control their shape are still poorly understood.In this work, I systematically analyzed known three-dimensional structures of the α-helical solenoid proteins to identify interactions and amino acid sequence patterns that lead to their curvature. This analysis revealed two modes of interactions that are common for the curved structures as follows: (i) the helices that form the concave surface have small Ala, Ser, and Gly residues in certain positions, and these residues reduce their interhelical distances; (ii) the “concave” helices also have large hydrophilic or aromatic side chains that intercalate between the helices of the convex surface and increase their interhelical distances. Reduction of the interhelical distances on one side of the solenoid and their increase on the opposite side results in the curved superhelical structure.To test the predictive power of the principles described above, I constructed a sequence pattern characteristic for the strongly curved α-helical solenoids and ran this pattern against the sequence data bases. It turned out that this sequence pattern matches several proteins containing so-called proteasome/cyclosome (PC) repeats (10Lupas A. Baumeister W. Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 195-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The members of this protein family include the two largest subunits of the 26 S proteasome and a protein of anaphase-promoting complex (APC). The 26 S proteasome is a major intracellular protease in eukaryotes (11Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 12Larsen C.N.

Because of its central role in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway, this large ATP-dependent enzyme is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, antigen presentation, and inflammation. The three-dimensional structures and functions of its protein subunits containing PC repeats are not known. The match between the sequence pattern of the curved α-solenoid and sequences of the PC repeat-containing proteins leads to a model of the three-dimensional structure for the Rpn1 and Rpn2 proteins of the 26 S proteasome. In accordance with this prediction, the repetitive parts of these proteins fold into a structure with a novel architecture resembling an α-helical toroid. The Rpn1 and Rpn2 toroidal structures have a central pore of about 20 Å in diameter that would allow the passage of a peptide substrate. The axial symmetry and the central pore of the Rpn1 and Rpn2 structures suggest that they are aligned along the axial pore of the ATPase hexamer and the 20 S core particle and form an “antechamber” of the 26 S proteasome. The toroidal structures and their arrangement within the proteasome are consistent with the data of electron microscopy (16Walz J. Erdmann A. Kania M. Typke D. Koster A.J. Baumeister W. J. Struct.

It is proposed that the function of this antechamber is to assist the ATPases in the unfolding of protein substrates prior to their proteolysis.The prediction of the three-dimensional structures of Rpn1 and Rpn2 proteins and the quaternary structure of the base module of the 19 S regulatory particle and its docking onto the 20 S core particle all contribute to a better understanding of regulation in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and open possibilities for a number of experimental tests.

In this work, I systematically analyzed known three-dimensional structures of the α-helical solenoid proteins to identify interactions and amino acid sequence patterns that lead to their curvature. This analysis revealed two modes of interactions that are common for the curved structures as follows: (i) the helices that form the concave surface have small Ala, Ser, and Gly residues in certain positions, and these residues reduce their interhelical distances; (ii) the “concave” helices also have large hydrophilic or aromatic side chains that intercalate between the helices of the convex surface and increase their interhelical distances. Reduction of the interhelical distances on one side of the solenoid and their increase on the opposite side results in the curved superhelical structure. To test the predictive power of the principles described above, I constructed a sequence pattern characteristic for the strongly curved α-helical solenoids and ran this pattern against the sequence data bases. It turned out that this sequence pattern matches several proteins containing so-called proteasome/cyclosome (PC) repeats (10Lupas A. Baumeister W. Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 195-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The members of this protein family include the two largest subunits of the 26 S proteasome and a protein of anaphase-promoting complex (APC). The 26 S proteasome is a major intracellular protease in eukaryotes (11Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 12Larsen C.N.

Because of its central role in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway, this large ATP-dependent enzyme is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, antigen presentation, and inflammation. The three-dimensional structures and functions of its protein subunits containing PC repeats are not known. The match between the sequence pattern of the curved α-solenoid and sequences of the PC repeat-containing proteins leads to a model of the three-dimensional structure for the Rpn1 and Rpn2 proteins of the 26 S proteasome. In accordance with this prediction, the repetitive parts of these proteins fold into a structure with a novel architecture resembling an α-helical toroid. The Rpn1 and Rpn2 toroidal structures have a central pore of about 20 Å in diameter that would allow the passage of a peptide substrate. The axial symmetry and the central pore of the Rpn1 and Rpn2 structures suggest that they are aligned along the axial pore of the ATPase hexamer and the 20 S core particle and form an “antechamber” of the 26 S proteasome. The toroidal structures and their arrangement within the proteasome are consistent with the data of electron microscopy (16Walz J. Erdmann A. Kania M. Typke D. Koster A.J. Baumeister W. J. Struct.

It is proposed that the function of this antechamber is to assist the ATPases in the unfolding of protein substrates prior to their proteolysis. The prediction of the three-dimensional structures of Rpn1 and Rpn2 proteins and the quaternary structure of the base module of the 19 S regulatory particle and its docking onto the 20 S core particle all contribute to a better understanding of regulation in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and open possibilities for a number of experimental tests.

https://openalex.org/W2082058976,"Many mutations in the Human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (<i>HERG</i>) cause type 2 congenital long QT syndrome (LQT2) by disrupting trafficking of the<i>HERG -</i>encoded potassium channel. Beyond observations that some mutations trap channels in the endoplasmic reticulum, little is known about how trafficking fails. Even less is known about what checkpoints are encountered in normal trafficking. To identify protein partners encountered as HERG channels are transported among subcellular compartments, we screened a human heart library with the C terminus of HERG using yeast two-hybrid technology. Among the proteins isolated was GM130, a Golgi-associated protein involved in vesicular transport. The interaction mapped to two non-contiguous regions of HERG and to a region just upstream of the GRASP-65 interaction domain of GM130. GM130 did not interact with the N or C terminus of either KvLQT1 or Shaker channels. LQT2-causing mutations in the HERG C terminus selectively disrupted interactions with GM130 but not Tara, another HERG-interacting protein. Native GM130 and stably expressed HERG were co-immunoprecipitated from HEK-293 cells using GM130 antibodies. In rat cardiac myocytes and HEK-293 cells, confocal immunocytochemistry showed co-localization of GM130 and HERG to the Golgi apparatus. Overexpression of GM130 suppressed HERG current amplitude in<i>Xenopus</i> oocytes, as if by providing an excess of substrate at the Golgi checkpoint. These findings indicate that GM130 plays a previously undefined role in cargo transport. We propose that the cytoplasmic C terminus of HERG participates in the tethering or possibly targeting of HERG-containing vesicles within the Golgi via its interaction with GM130."

Infections of immunocompromised and debilitated individuals caused byCandida sp. are the most frequent and problematic of fungal diseases. Triazole drugs, such as fluconazole and itraconazole, inhibit lanosterol 14α-demethylase and block the synthesis of ergosterol. These drugs have been used widely for the treatment of patients withCandida infections because of their limited toxicity to humans and their favorable pharmacokinetics. Fungal infections recalcitrant to triazole therapy occur frequently, however, due to the drug resistance of fungal strains. Candida albicans acquires resistance to azole drugs by overexpressing ABC transporters, antiporter proteins, or 14α-demethylase, by acquiring mutations in 14α-demethylase, or by changing its membrane composition (15Vanden Bossche H. Dromer F. Improvisi I. Lozano-Chiu M. Rex J.H. Sanglard D. Med. Mycol. 1998; 36: 119-128PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lupetti A. Danesi R. Campa M. Del Tacca M. Kelly S. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 76-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Although C. albicans is normally susceptible to azoles, the incidence of acquired resistance increased significantly in the 1990s before the advent of highly active antiretro-viral treatment therapy for AIDS patients. Throughout the 1990s, there was also an increase in the incidence of candidosis caused by non-C. albicans Candida species (17Coleman D.C. Rinaldi M.G. Haynes K.A. Rex J.H. Summerbell R.C. Anaissie E.J. Li A. Sullivan D.J. Med. Mycol. 1998; 36 Suppl. 1: 156-165PubMed Google Scholar) due to selection of strains with lower azole susceptibility. Candida glabratawas one the most common species responsible for these infections, which were difficult to treat (18Fidel Jr., P.L. Vazquez J.A. Sobel J.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 80-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The susceptibilities of C. glabrata clinical isolates to azole drugs, measured as minimum growth-inhibitory concentrations (MICs), are 16–64-fold higher than those for C. albicans(19Diekema D.J. Messer S.A. Brueggemann A.B. Coffman S.L. Doern G.V. Herwaldt L.A. Pfaller M.A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 40: 1298-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), implying that C. glabrata is naturally more resistant to azoles. ABC transporters Cdr1p (13Sanglard D. Ischer F. Calabrese D. Majcherczyk P.A. Bille J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2753-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Pdh1p (also referred to as Cdr2p; see “Discussion”) are thought to be the main contributors to the azole drug resistance of C. glabrata (12Miyazaki H.

Bille J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 1174-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cdr1p is highly expressed in azole-resistant clinical isolates, and it has been shown to be involved in fluconazole efflux (13Sanglard D. Ischer F. Calabrese D. Majcherczyk P.A. Bille J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2753-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At present there is no direct evidence that Pdh1p is involved in azole efflux, although a gradual increase in Pdh1p expression in C. glabrata strains has been reported during exposure to fluconazole in vivo(12Miyazaki H. Miyazaki Y. Geber A. Parkinson T. Hitchcock C. Falconer D.J. Ward D.J. Marsden K. Bennett J.E. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 1174-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These pumps were inferred to efflux divergent xenobiotics, because both pumps share about 70% amino acid sequence identity with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pdr5p, an ABC efflux pump that is responsible for pleiotropic drug resistance (12Miyazaki H.

More detailed knowledge of their drug efflux mechanisms may enable the development of improved antifungal drugs that are not pumped out from the cells or chemosensitizers that inhibit the pumping activity of these transporters in C. glabrata. There are about 30 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeencoding ABC transporters, some of which are responsible for the efflux of xenobiotics (5Wolfger H. Mamnun Y.M. Kuchler K. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 22Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 23Daniel T.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and probably has a similar number of transporters. Thus, the background activities of other endogenous pumps are likely to be problematic for the precise analysis of the efflux mechanism of individual drug efflux pumps in intact C. glabrata cells. We recently reported the functional expression ofC. albicans drug efflux pump CaCdr1p in S. cerevisiae strain AD1–8u−, which was used to resolve the problem of endogenous background drug efflux (26Nakamura K. Niimi M. Niimi K. Holmes A.R. Yates J.E. Decottignies A. Monk B.C. Goffeau A. Cannon R.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 3366-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Strain AD1–8u− was deleted in seven major drug efflux transporters and has a PDR1 gain-of-function mutation that highly activates the PDR5 promoter (26Nakamura K. Niimi M. Niimi K. Holmes A.R.

Drug efflux pump genes inserted at the PDR5 locus of this strain are highly expressed, and the pumping activities of the transporters can be measured at both the cellular level and in the plasma membrane fraction against a diminished background of endogenous drug efflux activity. In this study, Cdr1p and Pdh1p were hyperexpressed in S. cerevisiae, and the chemical specificities, drug efflux activities, and NTPase activities of plasma membrane fractions from the resultant yeast strains were analyzed. The post-translational modification of the fungal drug efflux transporters by phosphorylation and its differential effects on the regulation of drug efflux function were also investigated. Plasmids were maintained in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue. E. coliwas cultured in Luria-Bertani medium (Difco), to which ampicillin was added (50 μg/ml) as required. The genes described in this study were obtained from C. glabrata CBS138 and C. albicansATCC 10261.

Goffeau, Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium) and its derivatives expressing C. glabrataABC transporters. The yeast strains were cultured in YEPD broth (Difco) or complete synthetic medium (CSM; 790 mg/liter of complete supplement mixture (Bio 101, Vista, CA) and 26.7 g/liter Dropout Base (Bio 101)). For agar plates, 2% (w/v) Bacto agar (Difco) was added to the medium. CSM was buffered with 10 mm2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) and 18 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, for MIC assays and pump phosphorylation experiments. In the latter case, yeast nitrogen base (1.7 g/liter; Difco) and ammonium sulfate (5 g/liter) were added to the medium, instead of Dropout Base, to prepare CSM without glucose (CSM−Gluc). For the selection and maintenance of Ura+ strains, complete synthetic medium without uracil (CSM−URA; Bio 101) was used. Genomic DNA was prepared from C. glabrata CBS138 and C. albicans ATCC 10261 as described previously (28Scherer S. Stevens D.A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1987; 25: 675-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genes required for the construction of expression vectors were amplified by PCR, with the combinations of templates and primers indicated in Table I using KOD (+) DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes and inserted into pSK-PDR5PPUS vector plasmid (26Nakamura K. Niimi M. Niimi K. Holmes A.R. Yates J.E. Decottignies A. Monk B.C. Goffeau A.

Correct vector construction was confirmed by DNA sequencing with the DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences) and an ABI 373 DNA sequencer. The resultant vectors, named pSK-CDR1 and pSK-PDH1, were digested with XhoI and NotI or KpnI and NotI, respectively, to prepare their transformation cassettes for gene transfer. These cassettes and a PCR fragment ofPDH1 digested with HindIII (1–3 μg) were used to transform S. cerevisiae AD1–8u− by the lithium acetate transformation protocol (Alkali-Cation Yeast kit; Bio 101). Cdr1p- and Pdh1p-expressing strains were selected by growth on CSM−URA agar followed by growth on YEPD agar containing fluconazole (5 μg/ml). CDR1 and PDH1 genes from the resultant transformants were amplified by PCR using the primers GC-1 and GC-2 or GP-1 and GP-2 (Table I), respectively, and the DNA sequences of the PCR fragments were obtained as described above.Table IMaterials used in PCR amplifications for plasmid and yeast constructionGeneaNucleotide positions shown are from the open reading frames numbered in the 5′ to 3′ direction with the first base of the translation start codon being +1.Template DNAPrimerSequence (oligonucleotide name)bRestriction sites for the cloning are underlined.CaCDR2 terminator (4501–4871)Genomic DNA from C. albicans10261Sense5′-GACTAGTCGGATGGGGTCTTATTTTACAAT (AC2–1)Antisense5′-GACTAGTCTTTTAACTGGGACCCTGC (AC2–2)CDR1 (1–4500)Genomic DNA from C. glabrataCBS138Sense5′-CCCAAGCTTGATGTCTCTTGCAAGTGACAA (GC-1)Antisense5′-CGGAATTCCGTTATTTCTTGGCAAGTTTAC (GC-2)PDH1 -U (1–530)Genomic DNA from C. glabrataCBS138Sense5′-CCCAAGCTTATGAACACACCCGATGACTCT (GP-1)Antisense5′-GGAATTCGGCTTTAGGATGCGGAATGTATC (GP-2)PDH1 -L (4532–5486)Genomic DNA from C. glabrataCBS138Sense5′-TCCCCCCGGGCAAGAGTGCCTAAAACCAAT (GP-3)Antisense5′-GACTAGTCTGGACAAGAGAATATATCCTCG (GP-4)PDH1 (1–5486)Genomic DNA from C. glabrataCBS138Sense5′-CCCAAGCTTATGAACACACCCGATGACTCT (GP-1)Antisense5′-GACTAGTCTGGACAAGAGAATATATCCTCG (GP-4)a Nucleotide positions shown are from the open reading frames numbered in the 5′ to 3′ direction with the first base of the translation start codon being +1.b Restriction sites for the cloning are underlined.

These yeasts were transferred to CSM−Gluc or labeled with 20 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate, depending on the experiment. The following procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C. The culture (5 ml) was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min, and the yeast cell pellet was washed with 1 ml of ice cold 2% (w/v) glucose (or water in some cases). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min and suspended in 250 μl of homogenizing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, and 2% (w/v) glucose). The following were added to the cell suspension: 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1.2 μm antipain, 1.6 μmleupeptin, 1.1 μm pepstatin A, and 400 μl of glass beads (Sigma). The yeast cells were lysed using a MT-360 micro tube mixer (TOMY Seiko Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at maximum vibration for 10 min. The cell extract was collected, and the glass beads were washed with up to 1 ml of homogenizing buffer containing 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The cell extract was centrifuged (2,000 × g for 10 min) to remove unbroken cells and cellular debris, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 45 min. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of GTED-20 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20% (v/v) glycerol) containing 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of GTED-20 buffer and used as the crude membrane fraction for measuring pump protein expression and for Western blots. For the measurement of plasma membrane NTPase activity, a large scale crude membrane fraction was acidified with 0.1 m acetate to pH 5.0 and incubated for 5 min. The precipitated mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at either 5,000 × g for 30 s for glucose-fermenting cells or 8,000 × g for 10 min for glucose-starved cells. The supernatants were immediately neutralized (to pH 7.5) with 1 m Tris and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 45 min. The precipitated plasma membrane fractions were resuspended in GTED-20 buffer to a protein concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml and used in the NTPase assay. The protein concentrations of these membrane fractions were determined by a BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Crude membrane samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide (w/v)) (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) at 12 V for 1 h. The membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) skim milk and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (t-PBS) at room temperature for 2 h. After washing twice with PBS for 5 min, the membranes were incubated with anti-phosphoprotein kinase A substrate antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) diluted 1:1000 in t-PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 16 h. The blot was washed with PBS three times and then incubated with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase; AmershamBiosciences) diluted 1:5000 in t-PBS containing 1% (w/v) skim milk for 1 h. The membranes were washed with t-PBS containing 5% (w/v) skim milk for 15 min and twice with PBS alone for 15 min. Signal from the horseradish peroxidase was detected with an ECL system (AmershamBiosciences). For the identification of pump proteins, membrane fractions were incubated with 80 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min before SDS-PAGE. The putative pump-containing bands were excised from the gel, and the proteins were extracted with 1% (w/v) SDS buffered with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After concentration by precipitation with 50% acetone, the samples in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, were partially digested with lysyl endopeptidase (Wako, Osaka, Japan; at an enzyme/substrate molar ratio of 1:100) at 37 °C for 1 h, electrophoresed, and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. N-terminal sequences of several of the digested fragments were analyzed with an Applied Biosystems model 473A Protein Sequencer through the courtesy of Prof. Watabe and Dr. Nakaya at the University of Tokyo. Drug susceptibility of yeast strains was measured by filter disk assays on YEPD plates containing 1.5% (w/v) agar. Exponentially growing yeast cells were seeded at a concentration of 6 × 104cells/ml in the agar. Sterile Whatman paper disks, on which drug solutions had been spotted and dried at room temperature for 1 h to remove excess solvent, were placed on the agar plates. Miconazole, ketoconazole, nystatin, amphotericin B, flucytosine, cerulenin, cycloheximide, nigericin, monensin, rhodamine 123, rhodamine 6G, staurosporine, cytochalasin D, bafilomycin A1, 4-nitroquinolineN-oxide, trifluoperazine, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone, verapamil, tri-n-methyltin chloride, and tri-n-butyltin chloride were purchased from Sigma. Oligomycin, cyclosporin A, and protein kinase A inhibitor 14–22 amide were purchased from Calbiochem. The sources of other drugs used in this study were as follows: Fluconazole (Pfizer Ltd., Sandwich, Kent, UK), Itraconazole (Jannssen Research Foundation, Beerse, Belgium), terbinafine HCl (Novartis Pharma K.K., Tokyo, Japan), adriamycin (Kyowa Hakko, Tokyo, Japan), latrunculin A (Wako), aureobasidin A (Takara), G418 (Invitrogen), tri-n-ethyltin chloride (Strem Chemicals, Newburyport, MA), tri-n-propyltin chloride (Merck), tri-n-pentyltin chloride (Kanto Chemicals Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan), FK506 (Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan), H-89 and H-8 (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Theonellamide F and calyculin A were kindly provided by Prof. Fusetani (University of Tokyo). In some experiments, drug susceptibility of yeasts grown in YEPD was measured using a 96-well microtiter plate assay. Yeasts cultured in YEPD until early stationary phase were diluted toA 600 = 0.016 in YEPD in microtiter plate wells (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), drugs were added to the indicated final concentration, and the cells were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. The growth of the cells in individual wells was measured with a microplate reader (EL 312e; Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT) at 590 nm. The MICs of antifungal agents forS. cerevisiae cells were determined by a microdilution test based on the macrodilution reference method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (32National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Reference Method for Broth Dilution Antifungal Susceptibility Testing of Yeast, Approved standard M27-A. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Wayne, PA1997Google Scholar). Cells (10-μl suspension of 2 × 105 cells/ml) were inoculated into 90 μl of CSM buffered with MES and HEPES in microtiter plate wells. The wells contained doubling dilutions of antifungal agents in the CSM (final concentrations were as follows: fluconazole, 0.058–1024 μg/ml; itraconazole, 0.004–128 μg/ml; ketoconazole and miconazole, 0.002–32 μg/ml; flucytosine and nystatin, 0.031–64 μg/ml; amphotericin B, 0.0078–16 μg/ml; tri-n-methyltin chloride, 0.098–50 μm; other tri-n-alkyltin chlorides, 0.0098–5 μm). The microtiter plates were incubated at 35 °C for 48 h, and then the growth of cells in individual wells was measured with a microplate reader. The MIC80 was the lowest concentration of drug that inhibited the growth yield by at least 80% compared with the growth for a no-drug control. The efflux of rhodamine 6G from S. cerevisiae cells was determined as previously reported (26Nakamura K. Niimi M. Niimi K. Holmes A.R. Yates J.E. Decottignies A. Monk B.C. Goffeau A. Cannon R.D.

Yeast cells (1 × 109 cells) from YEPD cultures in late exponential growth phase (A 600 = 5.0–8.0) were collected by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 5 min, 20 °C) and washed twice with HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) and 100 mm NaCl. After 2 h of incubation in HBS at 27 °C with shaking (150 rpm), the cells were centrifuged as above and suspended in 4 ml of HBS supplemented with 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose and 10 μm rhodamine 6G. The cell suspension was incubated at 27 °C with shaking for 90 min to allow rhodamine accumulation under glucose starvation conditions. The starved cells were washed twice in HBS and finally suspended in 7.6 ml of HBS. Glucose (25 μl, 40 mm) was added to a portion of the cell suspension (475 μl) to initiate rhodamine 6G efflux. At specified intervals after the addition of glucose, the cells were removed by centrifugation, and triplicate 100-μl volumes of the supernatants were transferred to the wells of 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates. The rhodamine 6G fluorescence of the samples was measured with a CytoFluor Series 4000 spectrofluorimeter (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA). The excitation wavelength was selected using a 530/525 filter, and emission was detected using a 580/550 filter. Nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) activity of plasma membrane fractions was measured by adapting a previously described method (26Nakamura K. Niimi M. Niimi K. Holmes A.R. Yates J.E. Decottignies A. Monk B.C. Goffeau A. Cannon R.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 3366-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Purified plasma membrane samples (2.5 μg of protein), prepared as described above, were incubated in a solution (final volume 30 μl) containing 6 mm NTP and 7 mm MgSO4 in 59 mm MES-Tris buffer (pH 4.0–8.5). To eliminate possible contributions from nonspecific phosphatases and vacuolar or mitochondrial ATPases, 0.2 mmammonium molybdate, 50 mm KNO3, and 10 mm NaN3 were included, respectively, in the assay mixtures (30Monk B.C. Kurtz M.B. Marrinan J.A. Perlin D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6826-6836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligomycin (20 μm) was added to the assay for the control reactions. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 32.5 μl of a solution containing 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.6 mH2SO4, 1.2% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, and 1.6% (w/v) ascorbic acid. The amount of inorganic phosphate released from NTPs was measured at 690 nm after 10 min of incubation at room temperature. KH2PO4 solutions (0.4–2 mm) were used to obtain a standard curve. S. cerevisiae was chosen for the analysis ofC. glabrata efflux proteins for several reasons. It is a tractable yeast amenable to molecular genetic manipulation. It has been well studied, and much is known about the genes involved in pleiotropic drug resistance (21Balzi E. Wang M. Leterme S. Van Dyck L. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Che"
https://openalex.org/W2058421805,"Cpefat/fat mice are obese, diabetic, and infertile. They have a mutation in carboxypeptidase E (CPE), an enzyme that converts prohormone intermediates to bioactive peptides. The Cpefatmutation leads to rapid degradation of the enzyme. To test whether pro-thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) conversion to TRH involves CPE, processing was examined in theCpefat/fat mouse. Hypothalamic TRH is depressed by at least 75% compared with wild-type controls. Concentrations of pro-TRH forms are increased in homozygotes. TRH-[Gly4-Lys5-Arg6] and TRH-[Gly4-Lys5] represent approximately 45% of the total TRH-like immunoreactivity inCpefat/fat mice; they constitute ∼1% in controls. Levels of TRH-[Gly4] were depressed in homozygotes. Because the hypothalamus contains some TRH, another carboxypeptidase must be responsible for processing. Immunocytochemical studies indicate that TRH neurons contain CPE- and carboxypeptidase D-like immunoreactivity. Recombinant CPE or carboxypeptidase D can convert synthetic TRH-[Gly4-Lys5] and TRH-[Gly4-Lys5-Arg6] to TRH-[Gly4]. When Cpefat/fat mice are exposed to cold, they cannot maintain their body temperatures, and this loss is associated with hypothalamic TRH depletion and reduction in thyroid hormone. These findings demonstrate that theCpefat mutation can affect not only carboxypeptidase activity but also endoproteolysis. BecauseCpefat/fat mice cannot sustain a cold challenge, and because alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis can affect metabolism, deficits in pro-TRH processing may contribute to the obese and diabetic phenotype in these mice.

Neuropeptides and peptide hormones are first biosynthesized as precursors that must undergo a series of conversions to become biologically active (1Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Google Scholar, 2Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Google Scholar). Typically, maturation of these precursors begins with limited proteolysis. Excision of the pro-peptide usually occurs at monobasic, dibasic, or tetrabasic residues where subtilisin-like processing enzymes cleave the precursor on the C-terminal side of these amino acids. The endoproteolysis is usually followed by the sequential removal of the basic amino acid(s) residues by a carboxypeptidase-like enzyme (3Fricker L.D. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Google Scholar). In some situations, additional modifications can occur in the form of N-terminal acetylation or pyroglutamate formation, sulfation, and C-terminal amidation (4Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A. Mains R.E. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 57-85Google Scholar). These alterations usually serve to yield a peptide that is both biologically active and resistant to degradation.Further evidence that peptide processing is physiologically relevant has come from a mouse identified at the Jackson Laboratories. This animal was reported to be obese, diabetic, and infertile because of a spontaneous mutation in the fat gene (5Coleman D.L. Eichler E.M. J. Hered. 1990; 81: 424-427Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that the fat/fat mouse has a single point mutation in the carboxypeptidase E (CPE) 1The abbreviations used are: CPE, carboxypeptidase E; CPD, carboxypeptidase D; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; IR, immunoreactivity; PC, prohormone convertase; RIA, radioimmunoassay; T3, triiodothyronine; T4, thyroxine; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; WT, wild-type; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. 1The abbreviations used are: CPE, carboxypeptidase E; CPD, carboxypeptidase D; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; IR, immunoreactivity; PC, prohormone convertase; RIA, radioimmunoassay; T3, triiodothyronine; T4, thyroxine; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; WT, wild-type; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. gene, and hence, this mutation has been termed Cpefat (6Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Google Scholar). A Ser202 to Pro202 transition renders the enzyme catalytically inactive and subject to rapid degradation soon after synthesis. With respect to the diabetes in theCpefat/fat mouse, the mechanism underlying this dysfunction has been partially attributed to a deficiency in converting pro-insulin intermediates to insulin.To date, the mechanisms underlying the obesity in theCpefat/fat mouse are not well understood. The reason for these circumstances is probably because of the multifactorial nature of the regulation of food intake, absorption, and caloric utilization (7Leiter E.H. Kintner J. Flurkey K. Beamer W.G. Naggert J.K. Endocrine. 1999; 10: 57-66Google Scholar, 8Fricker L.D. Leiter E.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 390-393Google Scholar). In the latter case, the control of metabolism may be especially important. One hormonal system that plays an important role in the regulation of metabolism is the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis that is controlled by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).Hypophysiotrophic pro-TRH is synthesized in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, and it must undergo a number of different processing steps to yield mature TRH (9Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Endocrinol. Rev. 1999; 20: 599-648Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, TRH is released from median eminence nerve terminals into the hypophyseal blood where it is transported to the pituitary to stimulate the biosynthesis and secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; see Ref. 10Reichlin S. Wilson J.D. Foster D.W. Kronenberg H.M. Larsen P.R. Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. 9th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1998: 165-248Google Scholar). TSH, in turn, is carried in blood to the thyroid where it stimulates thyroid hormone biosynthesis and release. Besides this role, TRH can also exert some control over the release of prolactin, growth hormone, vasopressin, and insulin, as well as the classic neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and epinephrine. Furthermore, TRH is present in brain regions outside of the hypothalamus where it may serve as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator.In previous reports, it has been shown that the pro-TRH is cleaved endoproteolytically by two different members of the prohormone convertase (PC) family of enzymes, PC1/3 and PC2 (11Schaner P. Todd R.B. Seidah N.G. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19958-19968Google Scholar). In this scheme, PC1/3 appears to be primarily responsible for most of the major cleavage events. By contrast, although PC2 can perform many of these same conversions, this enzyme is required for the formation of the pEH24 peptide, and it is specifically involved in the processing of prepro-TRH178–199 to generate the pFQ7 and pSE14 peptides (11Schaner P. Todd R.B. Seidah N.G. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19958-19968Google Scholar, 12Nillni E.A. Aird F. Seidah N.G. Todd R.B. Koenig J.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 896-906Google Scholar). Because PC1/3 and PC2 seem to cleave the pro-TRH on the C-terminal side of dibasic residues, these basic amino acids must be removed from the pro-TRH intermediates for the TRH to be active biologically. An enzyme that has been hypothesized to produce these conversions is CPE. Because theCpefat/fat mouse has a mutation in this enzyme, this animal should allow us to examine this hypothesis and determine whether this mutation exerts any effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid function.DISCUSSIONCPE is an exopeptidase that is responsible for removing basic amino acids from the C-terminal of proteins and peptides (3Fricker L.D. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Google Scholar). A point mutation in the CPE gene (e.g. Ser202to Pro202 transition) is sufficient to reduce the efficiency of endoproteolytic cleavage of the pro-TRH and its high molecular mass products in Cpefat/fathypothalamus. These data indicate that mutation of this gene can exert effects upstream of its normal processing activity. In rats, pro-TRH is processed by PC 1/3 and 2 (11Schaner P. Todd R.B. Seidah N.G. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19958-19968Google Scholar, 12Nillni E.A. Aird F. Seidah N.G. Todd R.B. Koenig J.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 896-906Google Scholar). Both endoproteases are synthesized as pro-enzymes and must be processed to attain full activity (1Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Google Scholar, 2Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Google Scholar). It has been proposed that CPE may participate in the full activation of these convertases through removal of C-terminal basic amino acids or by inactivation of endogenous inhibitors (27Zhu X. Rouille Y. Lamango N.S. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4919-4924Google Scholar, 28Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. Brechler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15184-15188Google Scholar, 29Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that protein levels and enzymatic activities of both enzymes are altered in the brains of the Cpefat/fat mice (30Berman Y. Mzhavia N. Polonskaia A. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1466-1473Google Scholar). As a consequence, levels of pro-dynorphin and its high molecular mass intermediate (e.g. dynorphin A-17) are increased (30Berman Y. Mzhavia N. Polonskaia A. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1466-1473Google Scholar,31Fricker L.D. Berman Y.L. Leiter E.H. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30619-30624Google Scholar). Additionally, concentrations of pro-insulin in pancreas (6Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Google Scholar) and pro-opiomelanocortin in pituitary are enhanced (29Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Google Scholar, 31Fricker L.D. Berman Y.L. Leiter E.H. Devi L.A. J. Biol.

Despite these findings, impaired endoproteolysis of pro-peptides is not necessarily a common feature of the CPE mutation, because the levels of pro-cholecystokinin in brain are unchanged (33Cain B.M. Wang W. Beinfeld M.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4034-4037Google Scholar, 34Lacourse K.A. Friis-Hansen L. Samuelson L.C. Rehfeld J.F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 61-66Google Scholar), whereas those in intestine are reported to be either enhanced (34Lacourse K.A. Friis-Hansen L. Samuelson L.C. Rehfeld J.F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 61-66Google Scholar) or unaltered (33Cain B.M. Wang W. Beinfeld M.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4034-4037Google Scholar) from the WT controls.Besides alterations in TRH levels, concentrations of some high and low molecular mass pro-TRH intermediates were also changed in theCpefat/fat hypothalamus. Although the function of TRH has been studied for many years, only recently have physiological roles been ascribed to some of the other pro-TRH products (9Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Endocrinol. Rev. 1999; 20: 599-648Google Scholar). For instance, although 100-fold less potent than TRH, TRH-Gly4 stimulates gastric acid secretion in a dose-dependent manner (35Tache Y. Stephens Jr., R.L. Ishikawa T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 553: 269-285Google Scholar). Additional peptides that have biological activity include the prepro-TRH160–169 and the prepro-TRH178–199 (36Roussel J.-P. Hollande F. Bulant M. Astier H. Neuroendocrinology. 1991; 54: 559-565Google Scholar, 37Redei E. Hilderbrand H. Aird F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3557-3563Google Scholar). The prepro-TRH160–169 augments TRH-stimulated TSH secretion and potentiates TRH-induced gastric acid secretion when microinjected into the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. The prepro-TRH178–199 can serve as a corticotropin-releasing hormone inhibiting factor (37Redei E. Hilderbrand H. Aird F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3557-3563Google Scholar, 38McGivern R.F. Rittenhouse P. Aird F. Van de Kar L.D. Redei E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4886-4894Google Scholar), and it can stimulate prolactin release from the pituitary (12Nillni E.A. Aird F. Seidah N.G. Todd R.B. Koenig J.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 896-906Google Scholar). Inasmuch as these pro-TRH-derived peptides possess biological activity, and because processing of the pro-TRH intermediates are affected by theCPE mutation in mice, it may be expected that some of these functions will be abnormal in the Cpefat/fatmouse.In the present study, hypothalami fromCpefat/fat mice were found to contain high levels of the low molecular mass intermediates, TRH-[Gly4-Lys5-Arg6], and TRH-[Gly4-Lys5]. These data indicate that carboxypeptidase activity is deficient in vivo and that CPE is primarily responsible for this activity in TRH neurons. A role for CPE in TRH processing is strengthened further by the in vitro conversion of TRH-[Gly4-Lys5-Arg6] and TRH-[Gly4-Lys5] to TRH-[Gly4] and by the co-localization of CPE-like IR in TRH neurons. It should be noted that besides TRH intermediates, an increase in additional C-terminal basic amino acid-extended peptides has been observed for insulin (6Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Google Scholar), cholecystokinin (33Cain B.M. Wang W. Beinfeld M.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4034-4037Google Scholar, 34Lacourse K.A. Friis-Hansen L. Samuelson L.C. Rehfeld J.F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 61-66Google Scholar), gastrin (39Udupi V. Gomez P. Song L.

Commun. 2000; 267: 638-642Google Scholar), and neurotensin in the Cpefat mutant (41Rovere C. Viale A. Nahon J.-L. Kitabgi P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2954-2958Google Scholar).In murine hypothalamus, the Cpefat mutation depresses the levels of fully processed TRH. Additional peptides in brain that are also reduced include dynorphin (30Berman Y. Mzhavia N. Polonskaia A. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1466-1473Google Scholar, 31Fricker L.D. Berman Y.L.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4034-4037Google Scholar), neurotensin (41Rovere C. Viale A. Nahon J.-L. Kitabgi P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2954-2958Google Scholar), and substance P (42Perloff M.D. Kream R.M. Beinfeld M.C. Peptides. 1998; 19: 1115-1117Google Scholar). Besides removal of basic amino acids, amidation may also be affected in theCpefat/fat mouse. For instance, the molar ratio of TRH-[Gly4] to TRH and the percent of this glycine-extended peptide relative to the other TRH-like low molecular mass peptides were depressed in mutant hypothalami. A similar relationship has also been reported for glycine-extended cholecystokinin (34Lacourse K.A. Friis-Hansen L. Samuelson L.C. Rehfeld J.F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 61-66Google Scholar) but not for gastrin (40Hansen L.F. Rehfeld J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 638-642Google Scholar) in gut. Together, these data suggest that amidative activity may be influenced in theCpefat/fat mouse.Despite perturbations in pro-TRH processing,Cpefat/fat hypothalamus contains low quantities of TRH. This result suggests either that some residual CPE is present or that an additional carboxypeptidase resides in TRH neurons. One possible candidate is CPD. This enzyme is expressed in many brain regions including the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus where the hypophyseal TRH neurons are located (25Dong W. Fricker L.D. Day R. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 1301-1317Google Scholar). Moreover, CPD is co-localized with CPE in many different brain regions. In the present report, we show that hypothalamic TRH neurons contain CPE- and CPD-like IR. Moreover, recombinant CPD can process synthetic TRH-[Gly4-Lys5-Arg6] or TRH-[Gly4-Lys5] in vitro. These findings clearly show that CPD can mimic the actions of CPE. Despite this fact, hypothalamic levels of TRH-[Gly4-Lys5-Arg6] and TRH-[Gly4-Lys5] are augmented inCpefat/fat mice. One reason for the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo results may be the differential locations of the enzymes. Our immunocytochemistry results show that CPE-like IR is located in the perikarya and processes, whereas the CPD-like IR is confined to the cell body region of TRH neurons. These findings complement other studies where CPE has been localized primarily to mature secretory granules (43Fricker L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3886-3890Google Scholar), whereas CPD resides in the trans-Golgi network and immature secretory granules (44Varlamov O. Eng F.J. Novikova E.G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14759-14767Google Scholar). Because pro-TRH processing begins in the Golgi and continues in the secretory granule (16Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1271-1277Google Scholar, 45Perez de la Cruz I. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22736-22745Google Scholar), CPD could begin conversion of the pro-TRH intermediates in vivo; however, these effects would be transient as the intermediates passed to the mature granule and a build-up of intermediates could occur.Cold exposure stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis strongly (26Arancibia S. Rage F. Astier H. Tapia-Arancibia L. Neuroendocrinology. 1996; 64: 257-267Google Scholar). In rats, cold temperatures increase TRH mRNA levels in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (46Zoeller R.T. Kabeer N. Albers H.E. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2955-2962Google Scholar), augment TRH release from the median eminence (47Arancibia S. Tapia-Arancibia L. Assenmacher I. Astier H. Neuroendocrinology. 1983; 37: 225-228Google Scholar), stimulate TSH secretion from pituitary, and potentiate T4 and T3 contents in blood (48Rondeel J.M.M. de Greef W.J. Hop C.J. Rowland D.L. Visser T.J. Neuroendocrinology. 1991; 54: 477-481Google Scholar). In our studies, basal levels of serum TSH and T4 are similar among WT, heterozygous, and Cpefat/fatmice. A similar relationship has been reported for serum T4concentrations in homozygotes and lean controls (7Leiter E.H. Kintner J. Flurkey K. Beamer W.G. Naggert J.K. Endocrine. 1999; 10: 57-66Google Scholar). AlthoughCpefat/fat animals respond to cold, they cannot maintain their core body temperatures or sustain their endocrine responses. The already depressed hypothalamic TRH levels in theCpefat/fat mice are reduced further by an additional 38% with cold exposure. Although TRH neurons reside in several different hypothalamic areas, only the paraventricular nucleus controls anterior pituitary function (50Lechan R.M. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 55-65Google Scholar). The large reduction of TRH stores in response to cold suggests that much of the fully processed TRH is located in a readily releasable pool of peptide and that substantial quantities of TRH are released from the hypophyseal neurons. Together, these findings demonstrate that the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is impaired in its response to cold and that the TRH processing deficit in theCpefat/fat mouse may contribute to this deficiency.The fat/fat mouse was identified initially at Jackson Laboratories as being obese, diabetic, and infertile (5Coleman D.L. Eichler E.M. J. Hered. 1990; 81: 424-427Google Scholar). Although the regulation of each of these physiological processes is complex, the deficiency in pro-TRH conversion to TRH may contribute to its obesity and diabetes. For instance, disruption of the TRH gene in mice produces alterations in insulin secretion and hyperglycemia (51Yamada M. Saga Y. Shibusawa N. Hirato J. Murakami M. Iwasaki T. Hashimoto K. Satoh T. Wakabayashi K. Taketo M.M. Mori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10862-10867Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone influences oxygen consumption and metabolism in mammals, and changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid function can affect weight gain and appetite (52Ahima R.S. Prabakaran D. Mantzoros C. Qu D. Lowell B. Maratos-Flier E. Flier J.S. Nature. 1996; 382: 250-252Google Scholar, 53Nillni E.A. Vaslet C. Harris M. Hollenberg A. Bjorbak C. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36124-36133Google Scholar). In addition, the TSH response to TRH stimulation is increased in obesity (49Donders S.H. Pieters G.F. Heevel J.G. Ross H.A. Smals A.G. Kloppenborg P.W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1985; 61: 56-59Google Scholar). In our studies the TSH response to cold exposure was more robust in the mutants than in the WT animals. This enhanced responsivity in the presence of reduced hypothalamic tissue stores of TRH suggests that TRH levels in hypophyseal blood may be low in the Cpefat/fatmice and that the TRH receptor may be up-regulated on the pituitary. Similar to cold exposure, these circumstances could render this mutant unable to respond normally to metabolic and other challenges. Inasmuch as TRH is found in pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, pineal gland, neurohypophysis, and many regions of the central nervous system (10Reichlin S. Wilson J.D. Foster D.W. Kronenberg H.M. Larsen P.R. Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. 9th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1998: 165-248Google Scholar), a deficiency in pro-TRH processing could affect the physiology in a number of additional organs and systems. Neuropeptides and peptide hormones are first biosynthesized as precursors that must undergo a series of conversions to become biologically active (1Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Google Scholar, 2Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Google Scholar). Typically, maturation of these precursors begins with limited proteolysis. Excision of the pro-peptide usually occurs at monobasic, dibasic, or tetrabasic residues where subtilisin-like processing enzymes cleave the precursor on the C-terminal side of these amino acids. The endoproteolysis is usually followed by the sequential removal of the basic amino acid(s) residues by a carboxypeptidase-like enzyme (3Fricker L.D. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Google Scholar). In some situations, additional modifications can occur in the form of N-terminal acetylation or pyroglutamate formation, sulfation, and C-terminal amidation (4Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A. Mains R.E. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 57-85Google Scholar). These alterations usually serve to yield a peptide that is both biologically active and resistant to degradation. Further evidence that peptide processing is physiologically relevant has come from a mouse identified at the Jackson Laboratories. This animal was reported to be obese, diabetic, and infertile because of a spontaneous mutation in the fat gene (5Coleman D.L. Eichler E.M. J. Hered. 1990; 81: 424-427Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that the fat/fat mouse has a single point mutation in the carboxypeptidase E (CPE) 1The abbreviations used are: CPE, carboxypeptidase E; CPD, carboxypeptidase D; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; IR, immunoreactivity; PC, prohormone convertase; RIA, radioimmunoassay; T3, triiodothyronine; T4, thyroxine; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; WT, wild-type; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. 1The abbreviations used are: CPE, carboxypeptidase E; CPD, carboxypeptidase D; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; IR, immunoreactivity; PC, prohormone convertase; RIA, radioimmunoassay; T3, triiodothyronine; T4, thyroxine; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; WT, wild-type; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. gene, and hence, this mutation has been termed Cpefat (6Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Google Scholar). A Ser202 to Pro202 transition renders the enzyme catalytically inactive and subject to rapid degradation soon after synthesis. With respect to the diabetes in theCpefat/fat mouse, the mechanism underlying this dysfunction has been partially attributed to a deficiency in converting pro-insulin intermediates to insulin. To date, the mechanisms underlying the obesity in theCpefat/fat mouse are not well understood. The reason for these circumstances is probably because of the multifactorial nature of the regulation of food intake, absorption, and caloric utilization (7Leiter E.H. Kintner J. Flurkey K. Beamer W.G. Naggert J.K. Endocrine. 1999; 10: 57-66Google Scholar, 8Fricker L.D. Leiter E.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 390-393Google Scholar). In the latter case, the control of metabolism may be especially important. One hormonal system that plays an important role in the regulation of metabolism is the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis that is controlled by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Hypophysiotrophic pro-TRH is synthesized in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, and it must undergo a number of different processing steps to yield mature TRH (9Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Endocrinol. Rev. 1999; 20: 599-648Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, TRH is released from median eminence nerve terminals into the hypophyseal blood where it is transported to the pituitary to stimulate the biosynthesis and secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; see Ref. 10Reichlin S. Wilson J.D. Foster D.W. Kronenberg H.M. Larsen P.R. Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. 9th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1998: 165-248Google Scholar). TSH, in turn, is carried in blood to the thyroid where it stimulates thyroid hormone biosynthesis and release. Besides this role, TRH can also exert some control over the release of prolactin, growth hormone, vasopressin, and insulin, as well as the classic neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and epinephrine. Furthermore, TRH is present in brain regions outside of the hypothalamus where it may serve as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator. In previous reports, it has been shown that the pro-TRH is cleaved endoproteolytically by two different members of the prohormone convertase (PC) family of enzymes, PC1/3 and PC2 (11Schaner P. Todd R.B. Seidah N.G. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19958-19968Google Scholar). In this scheme, PC1/3 appears to be primarily responsible for most of the major cleavage events. By contrast, although PC2 can perform many of these same conversions, this enzyme is required for the formation of the pEH24 peptide, and it is specifically involved in the processing of prepro-TRH178–199 to generate the pFQ7 and pSE14 peptides (11Schaner P. Todd R.B. Seidah N.G. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19958-19968Google Scholar, 12Nillni E.A. Aird F. Seidah N.G. Todd R.B. Koenig J.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 896-906Google Scholar). Because PC1/3 and PC2 seem to cleave the pro-TRH on the C-terminal side of dibasic residues, these basic amino acids must be removed from the pro-TRH intermediates for the TRH to be active biologically. An enzyme that has been hypothesized to produce these conversions is CPE. Because theCpefat/fat mouse has a mutation in this enzyme, this animal should allow us to examine this hypothesis and determine whether this mutation exerts any effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid function. DISCUSSIONCPE is an exopeptidase that is responsible for removing basic amino acids from the C-terminal of proteins and peptides (3Fricker L.D. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Google Scholar). A point mutation in the CPE gene (e.g. Ser202to Pro202 transition) is sufficient to reduce the efficiency"

Lbc is a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor that contains a modulatory C-terminal region. To elucidate Lbc regulatory mechanism(s), a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the Lbc C-terminal region was carried out, resulting in multiple isolation of cDNAs encoding the same 734-amino acid Lbc interacting protein. The Lbc interacting protein has homology with the α-catenin cell adhesion component and is identical to the α-catenin-like α-catulin protein of unknown function. The human α-catulin gene (CTNNAL1) maps to 9q31–32. Here we identify the predicted endogenous α-catulin product, document α-catulin and Lbc co-expression in multiple human cell lines, and show α-catulin and Lbc subcellular co-fractionation and intracellular localization. The required regions for Lbc and α-catulin interaction were mapped, and complex formation between Lbc and α-catulin in mammalian cells was detected. Functionally, α-catulin co-expression leads to increased Lbc-induced serum response factor activation in vivo as measured by a transcriptional reporter assay. Furthermore, α-catulin co-expression enhances Lbc-induced GTP-Rho formation in vivo.

The ubiquitous Rho small GTPase is required for several key cellular responses including contractility, adhesion, migration, and growth. Rho controls a distinct signaling pathway that regulates serum-induced actin filament assembly (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar) and gene transcription via serum response factor (SRF) 1The abbreviations used are: SRF, serum response factor; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbloncogene homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; wt, wild type; BD, binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; RBD, Rho-binding domain; AD, activation domain; IDR, interdomain region; SRE, serum response element.(2Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence increasingly implicates involvement of the Rho pathway in disorders such as cancer, metastasis, and cardiovascular disease (3Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Google Scholar, 4Johns D.G. Dorrance A.M. Leite R. Weber D.S. Webb R.C. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 431-443Google Scholar, 5Merdek K.D. Toksoz D. Histol. Histopathol. 2002; 17: 915-927Google Scholar). However, regulation of this pathway is not well understood. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the Rho family GTPases, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, induce formation of the active, GTP-bound GTPase capable of transducing signals (6Cerione R. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Google Scholar) and play a key role, because they transduce signal inputs from activated cell surface receptors to Rho members (7Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Google Scholar). All Rho family GEFs contain the commonDbl oncogene homology (DH) domain, which confers GEF activity, and a tandem pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that has several functions (6Cerione R. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Google Scholar, 8Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 1-23Google Scholar). In addition, Rho GEFs contain unique N- or C-terminal regions that likely represent regulatory regions and often contain consensus signaling domains/motifs (6Cerione R. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Google Scholar, 8Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 1-23Google Scholar). Although the functional role of Rho GEFs is now apparent, Rho GEF regulation is in many cases poorly understood. The DH domain-containing Lbc oncogene product (9Toksoz D. Williams D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 621-628Google Scholar) is a specific GEF for Rho (10Zheng Y. Olson M. Hall A. Cerione R.C. Toksoz D. J. Biol.

Previous comparison of onco-Lbc with the normal Lbc homologue isolated from human muscle revealed that although both forms contain intact DH and PH domains, proto-Lbc or wild type Lbc (wt-Lbc) cDNA encodes an extended C-terminal region of 453 residues that is deleted from onco-Lbc (ΔCT-Lbc) (19Sterpetti P. Hack A.A. Bashar M.P. Park B. Cheng S.D. Knoll J.H. Urano T. Feig L.A. Toksoz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1334-1345Google Scholar). Subsequent reports of normally occurring Lbc splice variants with longer N termini has recently highlighted the multi-functionality of the Lbc Rho GEF. For example, Brx is an Lbc variant enriched in testes that is implicated in nuclear hormone modulation (20Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind S. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Google Scholar). In addition, AKAP-Lbc, which is enriched in the heart, functions as a protein kinase A-anchoring protein, because it contains an additional N-terminal protein kinase A-binding domain (21Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Google Scholar, 22Klussmann E. Edemir B. Pepperle B. Tamma G. Henn V. Klauschenz E. Hundsrucker C. Maric K. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 264-268Google Scholar). However, all normally occurring Lbc Rho GEF forms described to date contain a common C-terminal region following the DH/PH GEF domain cassette. The C-terminal region contains a unique sequence the notable feature of which is a ∼110-residue region of predicted α-helical structure that contains a consensus leucine zipper motif (19Sterpetti P. Hack A.A. Bashar M.P. Park B. Cheng S.D. Knoll J.H. Urano T. Feig L.A. Toksoz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1334-1345Google Scholar). Deletional analysis of the wt-Lbc C-terminal region indicated that this region contributes to regulation of Lbc transforming activity and subcellular localization (19Sterpetti P. Hack A.A. Bashar M.P. Park B. Cheng S.D. Knoll J.H. Urano T. Feig L.A. Toksoz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1334-1345Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of wt-Lbc modulation by the C-terminal region, we focused on identifying proteins that interact with this region using the yeast two-hybrid system, because such proteins may yield clues to Lbc regulatory mechanisms. Here we describe isolation and characterization of the Lbc-associated protein-1, α-catulin, which interacts specifically with the Lbc C-terminal region. α-Catulin, which has no previously ascribed function, has homology with the α-catenin adhesion component. We identify the endogenous α-catulin protein and document α-catulin and Lbc co-expression and co-fractionation in multiple human cell lines. The required regions for Lbc and α-catulin interaction were defined; furthermore, Lbc and α-catulin complex formation in mammalian cells was detected. Moreover, the functional effect of α-catulin on Lbc activity was determined in vivo by using a Rho-dependent SRF transcriptional reporter assay and by measuring changes in GTP-Rho formation. These results for the first time characterize the endogenous α-catulin protein and indicate a role for α-catulin in modulating the Rho signaling pathway. The Cos-1, HeLa, HT29, T84, HCT116, HEK293T, MCF-7, and Caco-2 cell lines are from ATCC. Lbc C-terminal region cDNA (418–893) (19Sterpetti P. Hack A.A. Bashar M.P. Park B. Cheng S.D. Knoll J.H.

Full-length α-catulin cDNA or α-catulin residues 524–734 were subcloned into the pcDNA3:Myc plasmid to generate the pcDNA-Catu:Myc and pcDNA-CTCatu:Myc mammalian expression plasmids, respectively, by PCR. Restriction enzyme sites were incorporated into the 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotide primers to allow directional subcloning. PCR products were gel-purified and Genecleened (Bio101), followed by restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. The mutants were sequenced to verify sequence fidelity. pSR-wt-Lbc:FLAG and pSR-ΔCTLbc:FLAG plasmids are described in Ref. 19Sterpetti P. Hack A.A. Bashar M.P. Park B. Cheng S.D. Knoll J.H. Urano T. Feig L.A. Toksoz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1334-1345Google Scholar. An Escherichia coli expressed and affinity-purified GST:α-catulin (1–490) fusion protein was used as immunogen to generate the anti-catulin polyclonal antiserum LP-1 in rabbits following standard procedures. The anti-Lbc antiserum is previously described (19Sterpetti P. Hack A.A. Bashar M.P. Park B. Cheng S.D. Knoll J.H. Urano T. Feig L.A. Toksoz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1334-1345Google Scholar). The anti-Myc 9E10, anti-Myc A-14, anti-GST-HRP, anti-RhoA, anti-α-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Sigma) were commercially obtained. Nucleotides 1972–3504 of wt-Lbc cDNA encoding C-terminal residues 417–893 (19Sterpetti P. Hack A.A. Bashar M.P. Park B. Cheng S.D. Knoll J.H. Urano T. Feig L.A. Toksoz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1334-1345Google Scholar) were subcloned into the pAS2-1 yeast vector (Clontech) for expression of yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD):Lbc C terminus fusion protein. Analyses confirmed that the BD:Lbc fusion protein was nontoxic and did not induce autonomous activation and was therefore suitable for use as a bait in the screening. A directionally cloned human HeLa cDNA library prepared in the pGAD yeast expression vector that generates GAL4 AD:cDNA fusion products (Clontech) was screened with the BD:Lbc bait as follows. Following BD:bait and AD:cDNA library co-transformation of competent Y190 yeast cells, co-transformants were plated on triple drop-out medium to select for interacting proteins in the presence of 30 mm 3-amino-triazole. 107total clones were screened, representing approximately twice the number of independent clones for this particular library. Colonies showing growth in −Leu/−Trp/−His selection medium after 8 days were tested for expression of the second reporter gene lacZ using a β-galactosidase filter assay (Clontech Matchmaker two-hybrid system protocol). Following this double selection procedure, 21 of the 45 putative interacting clones were analyzed. His+, β-gal+ clones were restreaked, and the β-galactosidase filter assay was repeated. AD:library plasmid DNAs were isolated from restreaked, β-galactosidase-positive clones. Interaction between two proteins was tested according to the recommended procedure (Clontech Matchmaker two-hybrid system protocol). cDNAs were tested for false positive activity by retransforming either with the BD:Lbc bait, the GAL4 BD vector, or a BD:lamin fusion construct. 18 cDNAs found to be positive only in the presence of the Lbc bait were further analyzed by DNA gel electrophoresis and sequencing following PCR with AD vector-specific primers (Clontech). An α-catulin cDNA probe was prepared using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Northern blot hybridization was carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Clontech). The filters were washed under stringent conditions. Metaphase spreads were prepared from human peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured for 72 h in the presence of phytohemagglutinin. α-Catulin cDNA was labeled with biotin 16-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by nick translation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and detection of immunofluorescence were performed as previously described (23Bell D.W. Taguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Gilks C.B. Zweidler-McKay P. Grimes H.L. Tsichlis P.N. Testa J.R. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 70: 263-267Google Scholar). Chromosomes were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole and observed with a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) operated by a Macintosh computer work station. Digitized images of diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and α-CATULIN/CTNNAL1 fluorescein signals were captured and merged using Oncor Image version 1.6 software. wt-Lbc C-terminal region (Lbc residues 416–893; Ref. 19Sterpetti P. Hack A.A. Bashar M.P. Park B. Cheng S.D. Knoll J.H. Urano T. Feig L.A. Toksoz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1334-1345Google Scholar) and α-catulin N-terminal region cDNAs (residues 1–537) were each subcloned into the pGEX3X vector (Pharmacia Corp.) for expression in E. coli DH5-α. Optimal growth conditions for soluble GST:catulin expression were 30 °C to A 600 = 1; for GST-Lbc CTerm, conditions were 37 °C to A 600= 2. Soluble fusion proteins were affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B bead conjugate (Pharmacia Corp.) and eluted following standard procedures (24Ausubel F.M. et al.Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates & Wiley InterScience, New York1988: 1631-1664Google Scholar). An equimolar amount of GST:Lbc CTerm was incubated with either GST or GST:catulin for 1 h at room temperature and then immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of bead-coupled M2 anti-FLAG antibody for 1 h at room temperature in TBS with 1% BSA. Reciprocally, GST:catulin was incubated with either GST or GST:Lbc Cterm and then immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of bead-coupled 9E10 anti-Myc antibody in TBS with 1% BSA. Bead-coupled antibodies were preincubated with 1% BSA to reduce nonspecific binding. Following four washes in TBS, 1% Triton, 1% octoglucoside, the co-immunoprecipitated material was resuspended in sample buffer with dithiothreitol, boiled, and analyzed by immunoblot. 100-mm dishes at 70% confluence were transfected with plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation for 5 h. After transfection the cells were grown 1–2 days and harvested. HEK293T cells were fractionated into the S-100 soluble fraction and the P-100 particulate fraction as previously described (19Sterpetti P. Hack A.A. Bashar M.P. Park B. Cheng S.D. Knoll J.H. Urano T. Feig L.A. Toksoz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1334-1345Google Scholar). HEK293T cells expressing Myc:α-catulin and FLAG:Lbc were grown on glass coverslips and washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium followed by two washes with PBS. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 5 min in 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked for 30 min in PBS containing 0.2% nonfat dry milk, 2% fetal calf serum, 0.1 m glycine, and 1% BSA. As primary antibodies, 1:150 dilution of rabbit anti-Myc A-14 and 1:200 dilution of mouse anti-FLAG M2 were used for α-catulin and Lbc detection, respectively. After three washes in PBS, the cells were incubated with TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) at 1:300 or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) at 1:200. After two washes in PBS, the coverslips were mounted and viewed on a Zeiss Axiovert 10 microscope. The images were captured by a Hamamatsu digital camera using Metamorph software. Insoluble lysate material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged products, agarose-bead conjugated anti-Myc 9E10 antibody or affinity gel-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody was used. Bead-coupled antibodies were previously incubated in 1% BSA to avoid nonspecific binding. After washing, antibody-coupled beads were added to cell lysates and allowed to immunoprecipitate from 4 h to overnight at 4 °C, followed by three washes with TBS with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cellular material in sample buffer with dithiothreitol was heated at 94 °C for 5 min and resolved by 10% SDS/PAGE. After transfer onto nitrocellulose, the filters were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS and then washed twice in TBS. The filters were probed for 1 h with either anti-FLAG M2 antibody at 10 μg/ml, anti-Myc 9E10 antibody at 1 μg/ml, or 1:1500 dilution of anti-Lbc or anti-catulin LP-1 antiserum in TBS with 5% nonfat milk. The filters were washed three times each for 15 min in TBS with 0.05% Tween. After incubation for 1 h with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase in TBS with 5% nonfat milk, the filters were washed three times each for 15 min. in TBS with 0.05% Tween, followed by two additional washes in TBS alone. For GST fusion protein detection, the filters were probed for 1 h with anti-GST-HRP antibody at 1:3000 dilution in TBS, followed by three washes for 15 min in TBS. ECL was performed using Renaissance Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The SRE.L luciferase reporter plasmid, which encodes a mutant SRE that contains SRF binding sites but eliminates the ternary complex factor-binding site and is potently activated by Rho signals (2Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Google Scholar), was used. All of the samples were transfected with 10 ng of Renilla luciferase plasmid as an internal control, and the total plasmid amount transfected was equalized by the addition of vector. 24 h following transfection of HEK293T cells in 6-well dishes, luciferase assays were performed using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's recommendation, and the luciferase activity was measured by luminometer. The results were internally normalized by sequential measurement of control Renilla and experimental firefly luciferase reporter plasmid activities. Each point was performed in triplicate. The cells were transiently transfected with plasmids and serum-starved overnight before harvesting. After 24 h, a portion of the cell lysate was incubated with affinity gel-bound GST-Rhotekin RBD fusion protein, and the Rho pull-down assay performed as described (25Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar). Subsequently, total cell lysate or pull-down material was resolved by 10% SDS/PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-RhoA antibody. The experiments for each group were performed at least twice. 18 cDNA clones were confirmed to positively interact with the GAL4 BD:Lbc C terminus fusion bait following a yeast two-hybrid screen of a GAL4 activation domain (AD):human HeLa cDNA fusion library. Sequencing revealed that all of the positives were one of two cDNAs of 2.3 or 2.45 kb, representing the same mRNA. The longest Lbc-interacting cDNA contained a 5′ Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation (26Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Google Scholar), followed by a 2.2-kb coding sequence in-frame with the GAL4 AD fusion sequence, a translation stop site, a 3′-untranslated sequence, and a poly(A) tail. Analysis of the deduced 734-residue polypeptide of predicted 82-kDa size indicates that it is hydrophilic, and analysis with the PROSITE data base (27Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2241-2245Google Scholar) for known protein motifs reveals a consensus tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site at residue 536, and multiple consensus protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. BLAST (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) search of the deduced Lbc-interacting peptide sequence against GenBankTM entries revealed most similarity to α-catenin. In addition, the search revealed that the sequence is identical to two recently described cDNAs alternately called CTNNAL1 (AF030233; Ref. 29Zhang J. Nelson M. Wang L. Liu W. Qian C. Shridhar V. Urrutia R. Smith D.I. Genomics. 1998; 54: 149-154Google Scholar) and α-catulin (30Janssens B. Staes K. van Roy F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 341-347Google Scholar) reported to have similarity to α-catenin. On this basis, we adopted the use of the α-catulin/CTNNAL1 names to designate the Lbc-interacting peptide and gene, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, BESTFIT similarity alignment of α-catulin with its closest human homologue, αN-catenin (neural) (CTNNA2 gene; P26232) (31Claverie J. Hardelin J. Legouis R. Levilliers J. Bougueleret L. Mattei M. Petit C. Genomics. 1993; 15: 13-20Google Scholar), shows 29% identity and 50% overall homology. α-Catulin also has similar overall homology (∼28% identity and 40% homology) to human αΕ-catenin (epithelial) (CTNNA1 gene; P35221) (32Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Cell. 1991; 65: 849-857Google Scholar), in addition to murine αN-catenin and Drosophila and Lytechinus variegatus (sea urchin) α-catenin (not shown). Fig. 1 indicates that α-catulin contains an extra 16 N-terminal residues not found in mammalian α-catenins. The homology between α-catulin and α-catenin lies within two blocks; the first homology block is a nearly contiguous sequence between α-catulin residues 18–524 and αN-catenin residues 2–504. This is followed by a region of ∼110 residues present in α-catenin that is missing from α-catulin. The second homology block spans α-catulin residues 525 until the final residue 734 and αN-catenin residues 615–897. This region contains four limited gaps in homology in which α-catulin lacks 68 residues present in αN-catenin. After this, αN-catenin contains 48 additional C-terminal residues. Comparison of α-catulin and human αE-catenin sequences generates a highly similar alignment to that shown in Fig. 1, although αE-catenin is a shorter product (907 residues) than αN-catenin (945 residues). Overall, in comparison with the original report describing CTNNAL1 (29Zhang J. Nelson M. Wang L. Liu W. Qian C. Shridhar V. Urrutia R. Smith D.I. Genomics. 1998; 54: 149-154Google Scholar), our analysis and the report by Janssens et al. (30Janssens B. Staes K. van Roy F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 341-347Google Scholar) reveals a greater similarity between CTNNAL1/α-catulin and αN-catenin based on the detection of the second homology block in α-catulin residues 525–734. α-Catenin is a member of the vinculin superfamily (32Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Cell. 1991; 65: 849-857Google Scholar, 33Herrenknecht K. Ozawa M. Lottspeich F. Lenter M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9156-9160Google Scholar), and α-catulin also shows substantial but lower homology (21% identity) to vinculin (30Janssens B. Staes K. van Roy F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 341-347Google Scholar). An α-catulin cDNA probe was used to map the chromosomal location of the CTNNAL1 gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. The α-catulin probe hybridized to chromosome 9 in 20 of 20 (100%) metaphase spreads from a normal male donor. As indicated by Fig.2, altogether, 43 of 64 fluorescence signals (67%) were located specifically at 9q31–32. Fig.3 A shows the presence of a single major ∼2.8-kb α-CATULIN mRNA transcript in several human tissues such as thymus, prostate, testes, ovary, small intestine, and colon. α-CATULIN mRNA expression is also reported in skeletal muscle, lung, heart, and placenta (30Janssens B. Staes K. van Roy F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 341-347Google Scholar), indicating that it is widely expressed. We previously reported high levels of LBC mRNA co-expression in these tissues (19Sterpetti P. Hack A.A. Bashar M.P. Park B. Cheng S.D. Knoll J.H. Urano T. Feig L.A. Toksoz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1334-1345Google Scholar). To identify the endogenous α-catulin protein, rabbit anti-catulin LP-1 antiserum was generated. Fig. 3 B (left panel) shows that LP-1 immune serum detects endogenous α-catulin (lane 2) of predicted ∼82-kDa size, in addition to the larger epitope-tagged form (lane 1), in HEK293T cells. In contrast, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 3B, the preimmune serum did not detect these bands. Next, the LP-1 antiserum was used to detect α-catulin protein by immunoblot analysis of lysates of human epithelial cell lines. Fig. 3 C shows expression of the predicted endogenous α-catulin product of ∼82 kDa in all human cell lines tested of different origins, such as cervical (HeLa), colon (HT29, T84, HCT116, CaCo2), breast (MCF-7), and human embryonic kidney (HEK293T). These data indicate that α-catulin is widely expressed. In addition, Fig. 3 C shows that when the same filters were immunoblotted with anti-Lbc antiserum, the 102–105-kDa wt-Lbc Rho GEF form is present in these cell lines. To investigate subcellular localization, untrasfected HEK293T cells were subjected to high speed fractionation into soluble (cytosolic) and pellet (membrane-rich) fractions. The fractions were resolved by SDS/PAGE and immunoblotted for endogenous RhoA, Lbc, α-catulin, and α-catenin. Fig. 3 D shows that consistent with previous reports (34Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Google Scholar), RhoA is present mainly in the soluble fraction, with a minor proportion in the pellet, verifying the fractionation procedure used. In contrast, substantial portions of endogenous Lbc and α-catulin localized to both the membrane-rich (pellet) fraction and the soluble (cytosolic) fraction. Finally, α-catenin was found to localize almost exclusively to the membrane-rich fraction. Thus, the overall fractionation patterns of α-catulin and α-catenin are distinct. Intracellular localization was further analyzed by immunofluorescence. The cells were transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged Lbc (pSR FLAG:wt-Lbc) and Myc-tagged α-catulin (pcDNA Myc:α-catulin) either singly or in combination, and indirect immunofluorescence was performed. Fig. 4 (A andB) shows that when expressed alone, α-catulin and Lbc, respectively, are present in the cytosol and at plasma membrane-proximal sites. Nuclear localization was not observed. In addition, when co-expressed (Fig. 4, C and D), α-catulin and Lbc continue to show a similar distribution in the cytosol and at plasma membrane-proximal sites. These results are consistent with the fractionation results. The sites of interaction within the wt-Lbc C-terminal region and α-catulin were initially mapped by yeast two-hybrid assay. As indicated in Fig.5 A, the first 250 residues of the Lbc C-terminal region, Lbc CTerm, is designated the interdomain region (IDR). This is followed by a ∼110-residue α-helical region designated α-Hel and finally the extreme C-terminal 115 residues designated Lbc-T. As shown in Fig. 5 A, deletion mutants of each of these domains were generated as yeast GAL4 BD fusion proteins; these fusion proteins were not toxic in yeast and did not induce autonomous activation in yeast reporter strains (results not shown). Following co-transformation of these BD:Lbc fusion mutants with the GAL4 AD: α-catulin fusion plasmid, co-transformants were assayed for interaction by testing for growth on triple drop-out medium and by β-galactosidase positivity. Fig. 5 A summarizes the results obtained, which"
https://openalex.org/W2130773324,"Leukotriene B4(LTB4) is a potent lipid mediator involved in host defense and inflammatory responses. It causes chemotaxis, generation of reactive oxygen species, and degranulation. However, only little is known of the molecular mechanisms by which LTB4 induces these biological activities. To analyze the intracellular signaling pathways to mediate lysosomal enzyme release through the cloned LTB4 receptor (BLT1), we transfected BLT1 to rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3). LTB4 dose-dependently released β-hexosaminidase, and the release was mostly inhibited when the cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin, indicating that the degranulation is mediated by Gi proteins. LTB4activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) through Gi, and inhibition of PI3-K by wortmannin or LY290042 inhibited degranulation. Granulocytes from PI3-Kγ-deficient mice showed reduced LTB4-induced degranulation, suggesting that this isozyme of PI3-K is involved in the degranulation. LTB4 also caused calcium release from intracellular stores and calcium influx from the outside milieu through Gi, but only the calcium influx is critical for the lysosomal enzyme release. Calcium influx and PI3-K activation are both downstream events of Gi, since they were inhibited by pertussis toxin. These two events are in essence independent each other, because calcium depletion did not affect PI3-K, and inhibition of PI3-K did not attenuate calcium influx significantly. Thus, our results have clearly shown that LTB4 binds BLT1 and activates Gi-like protein, and both PI3-Kγ activation and a sustained calcium elevation by calcium influx are necessary for enzyme release in these cells.

LTB4activates leukocytes, leading to chemotaxis, release of lysosomal enzyme, and production of superoxide anions, thus playing important roles in host defense (1Ford-Hutchinson A.W.

Overproduction of LTB4 is involved in various inflammatory diseases including psoriasis (3Iversen L. Kragballe K. Ziboh V.A.

Gastroenterology. 1984; 86: 453-460Google Scholar), and ischemic renal failure (7Noiri E. Yokomizo T. Nakao A. Izumi T. Fujita T. Kimura S. Shimizu T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 823-828Google Scholar). LTB4 binds to a specific G protein-coupled receptor named BLT1, which was cloned in our laboratory (8Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Google Scholar). Signaling to activate leukocytes through BLT1 is poorly understood, in part because most of the previous studies have been done using peripheral leukocytes, especially granulocytes. The lifetime of these cells is short (several days), which makes it difficult to perform studies using various drugs or gene transfection. We have previously analyzed signaling pathway from BLT1 using Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing human BLT1 (8Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Google Scholar). In these cells, LTB4 increases intracellular IP3 levels by Gq-like protein(s), inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity, and activates chemotaxis through Gi-like protein(s). In hematopoietic cells, however, the intracellular events leading to release of lysosomal enzymes and generation of oxygen species are poorly understood. We generated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells overexpressing BLT1 and examined the pathway to release lysosomal enzyme through BLT1. The major pathway of activating lysosomal enzyme release in mast cell involves the aggregation of high affinity receptors (FcεRI) for IgE by corresponding antigens (9Segal D.M. Taurog J.D. Metzger H.

Kuchtey J. Fewtrell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31225-31229Google Scholar). Although G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of PI3-K was also found in fMLP-stimulated human neutrophils and thrombin-stimulated human platelets (16Kucera G.L. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5345-5348Google Scholar, 17Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L. Taylor P. Omann G.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15668-15673Google Scholar, 18Cantley L.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3423-3428Google Scholar), the physiological role of PI3-K in these cells and its relation to calcium increase are somewhat uncertain. Here we demonstrate that LTB4-induced enzyme release requires a PI3-Kγ activation and calcium influx by the interaction of BLT1 and Gi. The sources of materials used in this work are as follows: [3H]leukotriene B4 (6,956 GBq/mmol), and [32P]orthophosphate (315–337 TBq/mmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; pertussis toxin (PTX) was from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan). Wortmannin was from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan); 1,2-bis-(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM) and Fura-2/AM were from Dojin (Kumamoto, Japan); LY294002, staurosporine, calphostin C, genistein, herbimycin A, PD98056, and SKF96365 were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin fraction V (BSA) was from Bayer (Kankakee, IL). LTB4 was kindly provided by Ono Pharmaceutical Company (Osaka, Japan). RBL-2H3 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2incubator. The open reading frame of the human LTB4receptor (BLT1) was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). RBL-2H3 cells (106 cells in a 10-cm dish) were transfected by lipofection with 30 μl of Transfectam® (Biosepra, Marlborough, MA) and 10 μg of the expression vector. Clones resistant to G418 (1 mg/ml; Invitrogen) were isolated by limiting dilution, tested for the receptor expression by binding assay, and maintained in the presence of 0.3 mg/ml G418. A binding assay for LTB4 in RBL-2H3 cells was performed as essentially described previously (20Ishii I. Izumi T. Tsukamoto H. Umeyama H. Ui M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7846-7854Google Scholar). Briefly, cells on a 24-well culture plate were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with various concentrations of [3H]LTB4 in the presence or absence of 10 μm unlabeled LTB4 in HEPES-Tyrode's BSA buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm d-glucose, 0.49 mmMgCl2, and 0.37 mmNaH2PO4) containing 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA. The cells were washed three times with HEPES-Tyrode's BSA buffer and lysed in 1% Triton X-100. The radioactivity of the cell lysate was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Ligand binding assay showed a specific binding for LTB4 (K d = 1 nm) comparable with the previous reports on LTB4 binding in human neutrophils (21Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 1-12Google Scholar, 22Lee E. Lindo T. Jackson N. Meng-Choong L. Reynolds P. Hill A. Haswell M. Jackson S. Kilfeather S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: 2079-2085Google Scholar). Degranulation was determined by measuring the release of a granule marker, β-hexosaminidase, as described previously (23Hide I. Bennett J.P. Pizzey A. Boonen G. Bar-Sagi D. Gomperts B.D. Tatham P.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 585-593Google Scholar). The cells were seeded in 24-well collagen-coated plates at 5 × 104 cells in 1 ml of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and serum-starved for 12 h. Adherent cells were washed twice in prewarmed PBS. Cells were then treated with LTB4, and the activity of β-hexosaminidase was quantified in the supernatants and the cell lysates by spectrophotometric analysis using p-nitrophenylN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide as a substrate (24Murakami M. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 197-206Google Scholar). Values for β-hexosaminidase released in the medium were expressed as the percentages of the total β-hexosaminidase, which was determined in the cells lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were cultured on glass bottom dishes (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan) for 12 h and loaded with 5 μmFura-2/AM in HEPES-Tyrode's BSA buffer at 37 °C for 1 h and further incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were stimulated with ligands at room temperature. For depletion of intracellular calcium, cells were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min in the presence of 40 μm BAPTA/AM before stimulation. Fluorometric cell images were recorded with an ICCD camera/image analysis system (ARGUS-50, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), and the ratios (340/380 nm) were determined. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) production was measured according to the method described by Traynor-Kaplan et al. (17Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L. Taylor P. Omann G.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15668-15673Google Scholar). RBL cells were cultured at a density of 106 cells/ml in a glass tube and serum-starved for 12 h. Medium was changed to the labeling buffer consisting of phosphate-free Hepes-Tyrode's BSA buffer. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min with [32P]orthophosphate (150 μCi/ml), the cells were stimulated with LTB4 and subjected to PI3-K assay as described previously (25Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Google Scholar). The cells were quenched by the addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol/8% HClO4 (50:100:5, v/v/v), followed by vigorous stirring. The sample was mixed with 0.5 ml of chloroform and 0.5 ml of 8% HClO4 to separate the organic phase, which was then washed with chloroform-saturated 1% HClO4 before being dried. The lipids were dissolved in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (95:5, v/v) and were spotted onto a TLC plate (Silica Gel 60; Merck), which had been impregnated with potassium oxalate by development with a solvent system comprising 1.2% potassium oxalate in methanol/water (2:3, v/v) and preactivated by heating at 110 °C for 20 min. After separation in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (70:20:50:20:20, v/v/v/v/v), the plate was dried, and the radioactivity was visualized with a Fuji BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Wild-type and PI3-Kγ-deficient mice (C57Bl/6 background) (26Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Jones R.G. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Stanford W.L. Bolon B. Wakeham A. Itie A. Bouchard D. Kozieradzki I. Joza N. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Suzuki A. Penninger J.M. Science. 2000; 287: 1040-1046Google Scholar) were injected intraperitoneally with 2 ml of 2% casein, and peritoneal cells were recovered after 4 h. Diff-Quik staining revealed more than 90% of the cells as granulocytes. MPO release from granulocytes were measured as reported previously (27Nusse O. Serrander L. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1279-1288Google Scholar) with some modifications. Fifty-μl aliquots of the cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) in Hanks' balanced saline solution, 0.05% BSA (fraction V; Sigma), and 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B (Sigma) were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min with or without wortmannin, and 50 μl of the ligand solution was added to initiate the reaction. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by placing the plate on ice. After centrifugation at 2,300 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, 20 μl of the supernatants were transferred to a new 96-well plate. The remaining cells were lysed by adding 20 μl of lysis buffer (1× Hanks' balanced saline solution, 5% Triton-X). The MPO activities of the supernatants and cells were measured in MPO assay buffer (50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.157 mg/mlo-dianisidine (Sigma), and 0.0005% hydrogen peroxide). Commercially available MPO (Calbiochem) in serial dilution was used as a standard. Mouse granulocytes were incubated with 3 μm Fura-2/AM (Dojin, Kumamoto, Japan) in HEPES-Tyrode's BSA buffer at 37 °C for 30 min, washed, and resuspended in HEPES-Tyrode's BSA buffer at a density of 4 × 106/ml. One-half ml of the cell suspension was applied to a CAF-100 system (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan), and 5 μl of LTB4 in Me2SO was added. Change in intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured by the ratio of emission fluorescence of 500 nm, by excitation at 340 and 380 nm. RBL-BLT1 cells showed LTB4-dependent release of β-hexosaminidase, a mast cell lysosomal enzyme, whereas mock-transfected cells did not (Fig. 1). The EC50 value of LTB4 was 24 ± 8 nm (n = 3 ± S.D.). We then examined the intracellular signals leading to the release of β-hexosaminidase. To examine the effects of PTX or depletion of conventional protein kinase C on ligand-induced β-hexosaminidase release, cells were treated overnight with 50 ng/ml PTX or 100 ng/ml PMA. LTB4-induced β-hexosaminidase release in RBL-BLT1 cells was mostly blocked by PTX pretreatment but was not affected by PMA pretreatment (Fig.2 A). These results indicate that in RBL-BLT1 cells, BLT1 couples to PTX-sensitive G protein(s), and conventional protein kinase C is not required for LTB4-induced degranulation. Next, the effects of various inhibitors on LTB4-induced β-hexosaminidase release were examined. Neither a broad kinase inhibitor (stauosporine), a protein kinase C inhibitor (calphostin C), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein and herbimycin A), nor a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor (PD98059) inhibited the LTB4-induced enzyme release (Fig. 2 B). Two kinds of PI3-K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, inhibited LTB4-induced enzyme release with IC50 values of 70 ± 32 nmand 0.103 ± 0.041 mm (n ± S.D.), respectively (Figs. 2 B and 3,A and B). Thus, in RBL-BLT1 cells, LTB4-induced enzyme release requires the activation of PI3-K.Figure 2Effects of various treatments on LTB4-induced β-hexosaminidase release in RBL-BLT1 cells. A, serum-depleted cells were preincubated with 50 ng/ml PTX or 100 ng/ml PMA overnight and stimulated with 100 nm LTB4 at 37 °C for 15 min. B, serum-depleted cells were preincubated with various inhibitors at 37 °C for 15 min and stimulated with 100 nm LTB4 at 37 °C for 15 min. Each data point is the mean ± S.D. of triplicates. Shown are representative data from three independent experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Inhibition of LTB4-induced β-hexosaminidase release in RBL-BLT1 cells by wortmannin and LY294002.Serum-depleted cells were pretreated with various doses of wortmannin (A) and LY294002 (B) at 37 °C for 15 min prior to stimulation with 100 nm LTB4. Each data point is the mean ± S.D. of triplicates. Presented are typical data from three independent experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then examined whether or not PIP3 was generated in RBL-BLT1 cells by LTB4 stimulation. As shown in Fig.4 A, cellular PIP3 level reached 2–3-fold basal level after 15 s of LTB4stimulation. LTB4-induced PIP3 production was transient and dose-dependent (Fig. 4, A–D). The increase in PIP3 was abolished by treatment of the cells with either wortmannin or LY294002 or by PTX pretreatment (Fig. 4 E). These results suggest that LTB4 utilizes PTX-sensitive G protein(s) to activate PI3-K. The PIP3 production was independent of calcium increase, since neither BAPTA/AM nor EGTA inhibited its production (Fig. 4 E; see below). BLT1 is known to couple with Gq-like proteins to activate phospholipase C in Chinese hamster ovary cells (8Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Google Scholar). In RBL-BLT1 cells, LTB4 induced a rapid increase of intracellular calcium concentration, and pretreatment of cells with PTX almost completely abolished the calcium response (Fig.5, A and B). This result shows that BLT1 couples to PTX-sensitive G protein(s) to increase intracellular calcium in RBL-BLT1 cells. To clarify whether LTB4-induced enzyme release requires intracellular calcium increase, we measured the enzyme release in media containing various concentrations of calcium. In the presence of 1 mm EGTA or 50 μm SKF96365, a calcium ion channel blocker, LTB4-induced enzyme release was completely blocked (Fig. 6 A), suggesting that extracellular calcium is required to release enzyme. Loading cells with an intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM is a common method to prevent initial rapid elevations of intracellular calcium induced by various ligands (28Ferby I.M. Waga I. Sakanaka C. Kume K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30485-30488Google Scholar, 29Kuijpers T.W. Hoogerwerf M. Roos D. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 72-77Google Scholar). Preloading of the cells with BAPTA/AM did not inhibit LTB4-induced enzyme release, but this enzyme release was delayed for 2–3 min compared to the untreated cells (Fig. 6 B). Next, we examined the time course of calcium mobilization by LTB4 in the presence or absence of BAPTA/AM. In the absence of BAPTA/AM, LTB4-induced calcium concentration peaked at 1 min after stimulation (Fig.7 A), whereas in BAPTA/AM-loaded cells, it was observed after 2–3 min of LTB4 stimulation (Fig. 7 B). In the presence of 1 mm EGTA or 50 μm SKF96365, LTB4induced an initial calcium transient, but a subsequent sustained calcium mobilization was not observed (Fig. 7, C andD).Figure 7Delayed intracellular calcium increase in BAPTA/AM-treated RBL-BLT1 cells. Fura-2/AM-loaded cells were stimulated with 100 nm LTB4. The ratio of fluorescent intensities was recorded with an Argus image analyzing system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, untreated cells; B, cells treated with 40 μmBAPTA/AM at 25 °C for 10 min; C, cells in the calcium-free Hepes-Tyrode's BSA buffer containing 1 mmEGTA; D, cells were treated with 50 μmSKF96365 at 25 °C for 10 min. Each trace was the average from recordings of 5–7 individual cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Compared with the results of Fig. 6, a calcium influx and a sustained calcium elevation are required for the enzyme release rather than the initial transient calcium mobilization from internal stores. We examined whether the activation of PI3-K is dependent on the intracellular calcium increase. Although there was no detectable increase in intracellular calcium after 20 s of 100 nm LTB4 application in BAPTA/AM-treated cells (Fig. 7 B), there was a significant PIP3 accumulation at the same time points (Fig. 4 E). By blocking the extracellular calcium influx by EGTA or SKF96365, there was no change in the initial calcium increase, but a sustained calcium influx was abolished (Fig. 7,C and D). Even in the presence of EGTA or BAPTA/AM, LTB4-induced PIP3 production was not affected (Fig. 4 E), suggesting that neither the initial nor a sustained calcium increase is required for PI3-K activation and production of PIP3 in these cells. These results show that LTB4-induced PI3-K activation is independent of calcium mobilization. Conversely, we examined the effects of PI3-K inhibition on calcium responses. Neither wortmannin nor LY29004 inhibited calcium responses significantly (Fig. 8). All of these data suggest that LTB4 activates Gi-like protein, and both PI3-K and calcium influx are pivotal for the enzyme release from RBL-BLT1 cells. To examine whether PI3-K activation plays crucial roles in degranulation of native cells, we measured LTB4- and fMLP-induced myeloperoxidase (MPO) release from granulocytes of wild-type and PI3-Kγ-deficient mice (26Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Jones R.G. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Stanford W.L. Bolon B. Wakeham A. Itie A. Bouchard D. Kozieradzki I. Joza N. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Suzuki A. Penninger J.M. Science. 2000; 287: 1040-1046Google Scholar). We chose MPO as a marker of degranulation, since MPO, but not β-hexosaminidase, is quite abundant in granulocytes and commonly used to examine stimulation-dependent degranulation. LTB4 and fMLP dose-dependently induced MPO release in these cells, and LTB4 was more potent than fMLP (Fig. 9 A). As is the case of RBL cells, wortmannin dose-dependently inhibited LTB4- and fMLP-induced MPO release (Fig. 9 A). In PI3-Kγ-deficient granulocytes, LTB4-induced MPO release was reduced to 20–25% of wild-type granulocytes (Fig. 9 B), suggesting that the γ isozyme of PI3-K plays a dominant role in LTB4-induced degranulation. We measured LTB4-induced calcium mobilization in wild-type and PI3-K γ-deficient granulocytes (Fig. 9 C). PI3-Kγ-deficient granulocytes showed a similar calcium increase toward 100 nm LTB4, showing that the reduced MPO release in PI3-Kγ-deficient granulocytes is not due to the reduced calcium increase. Enzyme release is one of the most important biological responses of inflammatory cells by LTB4 stimulation, leading to inflammation and host defense against infection (2Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Google Scholar). To study signaling for the enzyme release, we used rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, which contain the same functional G proteins reported in human neutrophils (30Hide M. Ali H. Price S.R. Moss J. Beaven M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 473-479Google Scholar). Expression of LTB4 receptor in RBL cells allowed us to examine the signaling pathway to LTB4-dependent enzyme release. LTB4 plays its functions via specific G protein-coupled receptors named BLT1 and BLT2 (8Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Google Scholar, 31Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-432Google Scholar), and we transfected BLT1, a high affinity and blood cell-specific LTB4 receptor to RBL cells. LTB4 is reported to activate the Gi and G16 classes of G proteins (32Gaudreau R. Le Gouill C. Metaoui S. Lemire S. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 15-18Google Scholar) to inhibit adenylate cyclase and to activate phospholipase C, respectively. Saito et al.(33Saito H. Okajima F. Molski T.F. Sha'afi R.I. Ui M. Ishizaka T. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3927-3934Google Scholar) reported that PTX-sensitive G protein mediates thrombin- and compound 48/80-induced histamine release in mast cells and basophils. In this study, we showed that a series of signaling including Gi, calcium influx, and PIP3 production are necessary for the ultimate enzyme release through LTB4-BLT1 interaction. First, as shown in Fig. 2 A, the degranulation is totally sensitive to PTX treatment, suggesting that Gi-like molecules are related to enzyme release. Next, we examined the effects of various inhibitors and toxins on LTB4-dependent enzyme release. We found that LTB4-triggered enzyme release was inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002 (Figs. 2 B and 3), suggesting that PI3-K is deeply involved in degranulation. We then examined whether LTB4 can indeed activate PI3-K and found that PIP3 production was enhanced to 2–3-fold upon LTB4 stimulation (Fig. 4, A–D). Pretreatment of the cells with PTX completely abolished LTB4-dependent PIP3 production, suggesting that Gi-like molecules are required for LTB4-dependent PI3-K activation (Fig.4 E). Pretreatment of the cells with various kinase inhibitors did not affect LTB4-induced enzyme releases (Fig. 2 B). Depletion of conventional protein kinase C by overnight PMA treatment did not inhibit enzyme releases (Fig.2 A). GF109203X at higher concentrations showed inhibitory effects on the enzyme release (data not shown). GF109203X is an inhibitor for both conventional protein kinase C and atypical protein kinase C (34Hofmann J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that atypical protein kinase C is involved in either step for degranulation (35Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Google Scholar, 36Ozawa K. Yamada K. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2280-2283Google Scholar). Haribabuet al. (37Haribabu B. Zhelev D.V. Pridgen B.C. Richardson R.M. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37087-37092Google Scholar) reported that the chemotaxis was blocked by PTX, showing that BLT1 couples to PTX-sensitive Gi-like proteins in RBL-BLT1 cells. They also showed that BLT1-mediated calcium increase and enzyme release were almost insensitive to PTX or wortmannin treatment. In our study, BLT1-mediated calcium increase, enzyme release, and PIP3 production were sensitive to PTX (Figs.2 A, 4 E, and 5). We do not have clear explanations for this discrepancy, but the experimental conditions and stable cell lines with different expression levels of BLT1 can cause the apparent difference. Calcium mobilization by FcεRI cross-linking is essential to antigen-induced enzyme release in RBL cells (15Kim T.D. Eddlestone G.T. Mahmoud S.F. Kuchtey J. Fewtrell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31225-31229Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the relationship between calcium mobilization and enzyme release. Calcium mobilization from internal stores and subsequent calcium entry from the extracellular space are the two major components of calcium increase following activation of cell surface receptors (38Penner R. Fasolato C. Hoth M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 368-374Google Scholar). In our experiments, EGTA or SKF96365, a calcium channel blocker, inhibited LTB4-induced enzyme release, showing the critical role of calcium influx in enzyme release. Calcium depletion in these cells by BAPTA/AM loading resulted in the delayed increase of intracellular calcium (Fig. 7 B). BAPTA/AM treatment caused the similar delay in LTB4-induced enzyme release (Fig. 6 B). The local high calcium concentrations by calcium influx or a sustained calcium elevation with a critical duration might be necessary for the enzyme release. Finally, we have performed a series of experiments to identify the relationship between calcium influx and PI3-K activation. Neither EGTA nor BAPTA/AM treatment affected LTB4-depended PIP3 production (Fig. 4 E), showing that PI3-K activation does not require calcium increase. Conversely, we determined whether inhibition of PI3-K affects calcium mobilization or calcium influx, since several investigators have reported that PI3-K regulates phospholipase Cγ in RBL cells with FcεRI activation (39Ching T.T. Hsu A.L. Johnson A.J. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14814-14820Google Scholar, 40Smith A.J. Surviladze Z. Gaudet E.A. Backer J.M. Mitchell C.A. Wilson B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17213-17220Google Scholar). We found that treatment of cells with wortmannin or LY294002 did not significantly change the calcium response by LTB4 stimulation (Fig. 8). In three independent lines of PI3-Kγ null mice, calcium mobilization in neutrophils was examined using various chemoattractants. fMLP (26Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Jones R.G. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J.

We also confirmed that LTB4-induced calcium mobilization was not reduced in PI3-Kγ null granulocytes (Fig. 9 C). It is an important future issue how Gi activates PI3-K in RBL-2H3 cells. The role of the βγ subunit of G protein might be the most important, since PI3-Kγ activated by the βγ subunit of G proteins induces respiratory burst in hematopoietic cells (43Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Google Scholar, 44Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M.

Signals to calcium influx from Gi molecules are another concern for future studies. They are either due to direct activation of calcium channels or due to the capacitance calcium entry as proposed (45Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Google Scholar, 46Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14669-14671Google Scholar, 47Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 153-169Google Scholar). In summary, using RBL-2H3 cells expressing BLT1, we found that PTX-sensitive Gi molecules are important for the degranulation process. Gi then activates PI3-K and calcium influx, and both are required for enzyme release in inflammatory cells. We further demonstrated that calcium influx and PI3-K might be processes that are independent from each other, although both are downstream events of Gi activation. Although these two signals are required for degranulation, other downstream molecules of Gi can also play roles in the enzyme release. We thank Dr. N. Nakatani, Dr. K.

https://openalex.org/W2011320792,"Previous genetic studies have suggested that a putative chromosome-encoded helicase, PcrA, is required for the rolling circle replication of plasmid pT181 in Staphylococcus aureus. We have overexpressed and purified the staphylococcal PcrA protein and studied its biochemical propertiesin vitro. Purified PcrA helicase supported the in vitro replication of plasmid pT181. It had ATPase activity that was stimulated in the presence of single-stranded DNA. Unlike many replicative helicases, PcrA was highly active as a 5′ → 3′ helicase and had a weaker 3′ → 5′ helicase activity. The RepC initiator protein encoded by pT181 nicks at the origin of replication and becomes covalently attached to the 5′ end of the DNA. The 3′ OH end at the nick then serves as a primer for displacement synthesis. PcrA helicase showed an origin-specific unwinding activity with supercoiled plasmid pT181 DNA that had been nicked at the origin by RepC. We also provide direct evidence for a protein-protein interaction between PcrA and RepC proteins. Our results are consistent with a model in which the PcrA helicase is targeted to the pT181 origin through a protein-protein interaction with RepC and facilitates the movement of the replisome by initiating unwinding from the RepC-generated nick.

DNA helicases play critical roles in DNA transactions such as replication, transcription, recombination, and repair (1Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol.

Most bacterial species contain several DNA helicases that are involved in one or more processes of DNA metabolism. Escherichia colicells contain a number of helicases, of which DnaB, UvrD, and Rep are the best studied (1Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The DnaB helicase is necessary for cell survival and is known to be involved in the theta-type replication of theE. coli chromosome and several plasmids. The UvrD helicase (DNA helicase (II) is involved in DNA repair in E. coli, whereas the Rep helicase is required for rolling circle (RC) 1The abbreviations used for: RC, rolling circle; SC, supercoiled; ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; OC, open circular; nt, nucleotide(s); MBP, maltose binding protein. 1The abbreviations used for: RC, rolling circle; SC, supercoiled; ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; OC, open circular; nt, nucleotide(s); MBP, maltose binding protein. replication of single-stranded (ss) DNA phages such as M13 and φX174 (1Hall M.C.

TheStaphylococcus aureus pcrA gene was identified several years ago and found to be required for the RC replication of plasmid pT181 (6Iordanescu S. Bargonetti J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4501-4503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Iordanescu S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the pcrA gene was also identified inBacillus subtilis, and genetic studies have shown that PcrA is required for both DNA repair and RC plasmid replication and appears to incorporate the function of both the Rep and UvrD proteins ofE. coli (8Petit M.-A. Dervyn E. Rose M. Entian K.-D. McGovern S. Ehrlich S.D. Bruand C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The S. aureus and B. subtilis PcrA helicases share 59% identity and 74% similarity, are required for cell viability, and may also play a role in replication of the chromosomal DNA (7Iordanescu S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Petit M.-A. Dervyn E. Rose M. Entian K.-D. McGovern S. Ehrlich S.D. Bruand C. Mol.

The pcrA gene has also been identified in several other Gram-positive bacteria such asBacillus stearothermophilus, Lactococcus lactis,Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptomyces coelicolor, and it is likely that they have similar functions in their respective hosts. The PcrA helicases of Gram-positive bacteria belong to superfamily I of DNA helicases (1Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 2Soultanas P. Wigley D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Plasmid pT181 of S. aureus replicates by a rolling circle (RC) mechanism (9Khan S.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 442-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10del Solar G. Giraldo R. Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Espinosa M. Diaz-Orejas R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 434-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RepC initiator protein encoded by pT181 nicks at the origin of replication and becomes covalently attached to the 5′ end of the DNA (11Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Rosenblum W.D. Khan S.A. Proc.

Biol. 1995; 254: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 3′ OH end at the nick site then serves as a primer for displacement synthesis, which presumably involves unwinding of the DNA by the PcrA helicase ahead of the replication fork. During the termination of plasmid RC replication, the RepC protein covalently attached to the DNA is expected to catalyze additional transesterification reactions leading to the release of the parental circular leading strand of the DNA and a supercoiled (SC) DNA containing a newly synthesized leading strand (13Zhao A.C. Khan S.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An S. aureus mutant carrying the pcrA3 mutation was shown to be defective in the RC replication of plasmid pT181, but this mutation did not affect chromosome replication, replication of other RC plasmids, or cell survival (7Iordanescu S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Additional in vivo studies showed that the pcrA3 mutants of S. aureus andB. subtilis accumulated nicked plasmid pT181 DNA, and further studies have suggested that PcrA may be required for unwinding of the plasmid DNA from the initiator protein-generated nick, an event that is required for plasmid RC replication (8Petit M.-A.

Biol. 1991; 221: 1183-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mutants in the replication initiator protein of pT181, RepC, have been isolated that allow plasmid replication in the pcrA3 strain, suggesting an interaction between PcrA and RepC proteins (15Iordanescu S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3916-3917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PcrA helicase ofB. stearothermophilus has been purified, and its crystal structure has been determined (16Bird L.E.

Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). It shows a strong helicase activity with double-stranded (ds) substrates containing a 3′ ss tail and a limited activity with substrates containing a 5′ ss tail (16Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A.

This PcrA is one of the few helicases that act as monomers in contrast to the more common replicative helicases, which act as hexamers (1Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 2Soultanas P. Wigley D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Korolev S.

Webb M.R. Wigley D.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3799-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Dillingham M.S. Soultanas P. Wiley P. Webb M.R. Wigley D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8381-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The PcrA helicases of B. stearothermophilus and S. aureus have 60% identity. The B. stearothermophilus PcrA helicase activity is not very processive, but the RepD initiator protein encoded by the S. aureus plasmid pC221 enhances its processivity (21Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Papadopoulos F. Phillips S.E.V. Thomas C.D. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This suggests that the B. stearothermophilus PcrA may interact with RC initiator proteins. In an effort to understand the role of S. aureus PcrA in the RC replication of its native pT181 plasmid, we have overexpressed and purified this protein as a fusion with six histidine (His6) residues and studied its biochemical activities. Purified PcrA supported in vitro replication of pT181 in cell extracts made from the pcrA3 mutant of S. aureus, providing a direct biochemical evidence for its role in plasmid RC replication. PcrA was also found to have a robust ATPase activity that was stimulated in the presence of ssDNA. It had a strong 5′ → 3′ helicase activity and a weaker 3′ → 5′ helicase activity. We also report that PcrA is able to unwind SC pT181 DNA nicked at the origin by the RepC initiator protein. This unwinding required both sequence-specific noncovalent binding of RepC to the origin, as well as the presence of covalently attached RepC at the nick site. Our data support a model in which PcrA is recruited to the pT181 origin through its interaction with RepC followed by unwinding of the DNA ahead of the replication fork by PcrA. When the replication fork reaches the termination site, i.e. the regenerated origin sequence, PcrA may be displaced, and RepC covalently attached to the displaced 5′ end of the leading strand is expected to catalyze DNA cleavage-rejoining events, resulting in the release of ss circular leading strand of the DNA. The pcrA gene was amplified by PCR using the chromosomal DNA from S. aureus S6 as the template. The sequences of the primers used were: 5′-CCGGATCCAATGCGTTATTAAATCATATGAATACAGAGCAAAGTG-3′ for the forward primer and 5′-CCGGATCCATGCCTTCTCCCCAGGCTTTATGCATC-3′ for the reverse primer. The PCR primers contained BamHI linkers at the ends. The reaction mixtures contained 200 μm of each dNTP, 250 ng of S. aureus genomic DNA, 1 μm of each primer, and 5 units of the Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The conditions of amplification were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min; 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 6 min for 25 cycles; and 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified product was gel-purified and digested with BamHI. The pcrAgene was then fused in-frame to the His6 epitope at theBamHI site of the pQE30 vector from Qiagen. This DNA was expected to encode a PcrA protein with His6 residues fused at its amino-terminal end. The ligation mixture was then introduced into E. coli M15 by electroporation, and the appropriate clones were isolated for protein overexpression. A single colony of theE. coli strain expressing the His-PcrA protein was grown overnight in 10 ml of LB containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C. This culture was diluted into 1 liter of prewarmed LB, and the cells were grown to the mid-exponential phase (A 600 of ∼0.5) at 37 °C. Expression of the PcrA protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-α-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.25 mm, and the culture was further shaken at room temperature for 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in a final volume of 20 ml of the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, proteinase inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/50 ml from Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10 mm imidazole, and 10% ethylene glycol). This suspension was quickly frozen in a dry ice-ethanol bath and then thawed at 15 °C. The freeze-thaw cycle was repeated one more time. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml, and the suspension was incubated for 30 min on ice, followed by two quick freeze-thaw steps. Ultracentrifugation was performed in SW41 rotor at 33,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant (about 10 ml) was collected and diluted with an equal volume of the lysis buffer lacking β-mercaptoethanol. The diluted supernatant (about 20 ml) was added to 1 ml of the nickel-coated resin and mixed by gentle inversion at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was then packed onto a column that was washed with 10 column volumes of the lysis buffer containing 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The PcrA protein was then eluted with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 200 mm imidazole, and 10% ethylene glycol. Small aliquots (0.5 ml) were collected. The concentration of the His-PcrA preparation reached 1–2 mg/ml in the peak fractions, and the purity was about 95% based on SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Plasmid pT181cop608was prepared by CsCl/ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugation (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Other plasmid DNAs were isolated by using the Maxi Prep kit from Qiagen. Chromosomal DNA from S. aureus S6 was prepared by phenol-chloroform extraction. Cell-free replication extracts were prepared from theS. aureus strain RN4220 and the pcrA3 mutant as described (23Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Rosenblum W.D. Khan S.A. J. Biol.

Replication reactions (30 μl) contained 600 μg of protein extracts, 500 ng of pT181cop608 DNA, 200 ng of RepC protein, and the indicated amounts of the PcrA protein. Replication products were labeled with [α-32P]dATP. The reactions were incubated at 32 °C for 1 h, treated with proteinase K, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and DNA-isolated by alcohol precipitation (24Chang T.-L. Kramer M.G. Ansari R.A. Khan S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13529-13534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels using Tris-borate-EDTA buffer containing 1 μg/ml of ethidium bromide (24Chang T.-L. Kramer M.G. Ansari R.A. Khan S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13529-13534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. ATPase activity of PcrA was measured by hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP or dATP. The reactions (20 μl) were carried out in 1× TEKEM buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg (OAc)2, and 10% ethylene glycol (v/v)) containing 1 μCi of [α-32P]dATP and the indicated amounts of PcrA. The reaction mixtures also contained 500 ng of SC pT181cop608 DNA, 100 ng of ss oligonucleotide, and 200 ng RepC where indicated. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. To stop the reaction, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 83 mm, and 1-μl aliquots were subjected to thin layer chromatography on cellulose polyethyleneimine sheets using the 0.5 m KH2PO4 (pH 3.5) buffer. The TLC sheets were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Double-stranded oligonucleotide substrates containing 3′or 5′ tails or blunt ends were prepared by labeling one strand with 32P at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and annealing to the cold complementary strand. Oligonucleotide sequences used in this study are listed in TableI. Helicase reactions were performed at 37 °C for 30 min in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, ∼1.75 ng of the DNA substrates, and the indicated amounts of PcrA helicase. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS dye, and the products were analyzed by 10% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The gels were subsequently dried and exposed to Kodak x-ray films.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyNumbers correspond to the nucleotide positions in the plasmid pT181 origin (1Hall M.C.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One-half microgram of pT181cop608 DNA was incubated in the presence or absence of RepC (200 ng) and/or PcrA (200 ng) at 32 °C for 30 min. RepC-nicked OC pT181cop608 DNA devoid of RepC was generated as follows. The plasmid DNA was nicked by RepC as described above, and the protein was removed by proteinase K digestion at 37 °C for 30 min followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and alcohol precipitation. The nicked DNA was then used as a substrate for DNA unwinding assays with PcrA. The reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels with Tris-borate-EDTA buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. 7.5 units of S1 nuclease in 300 μl of S1 buffer (0.28 m NaCl, 0.05 msodium acetate, and 4.5 mm ZnSO4) were added directly to the products of DNA relaxation/unwinding reactions, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of stop solution containing 4m ammonium acetate, 50 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml tRNA, extracted with phenol/chloroform, subjected to alcohol-precipitation, and finally resuspended in TE buffer. The reaction products were then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis as described above. Two hundred microliters ofE. coli cell lysates containing the MBP-RepC fusion protein were absorbed on to 50 μl of amylase-resin columns as described (24Chang T.-L. Kramer M.G. Ansari R.A. Khan S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13529-13534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and washed with lysis buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, 200 μl of 1× TEKEM buffer containing 3 μg of His-PcrA was mixed with MBP-RepC bound to the resin and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The suspension was then washed three times with 1× TEKEM buffer, and the proteins were eluted directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In control experiments, the His-PcrA protein was loaded on amylase-resin columns not containing any bound MBP-RepC. The eluted proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were blotted onto membranes (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and hybridized with either a MBP monoclonal antibody (New England Biolabs) or His6 monoclonal antibody (Qiagen) and visualized by ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pcrA gene was amplified from S. aureus S6 by PCR and cloned into the pQE30 expression vector. This generated a translational fusion of PcrA with six histidine residues at its amino-terminal end. The His-PcrA protein (hereafter referred to simply as PcrA) was overexpressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel resin. The purified protein was greater than 90% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue (data not shown). The PcrA protein had an approximate size of 80 kDa, consistent with the size of the pcrA gene (7Iordanescu S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In vitro replication experiments were done to test whether the purified PcrA protein was biologically active. As shown previously, the purified pT181 initiator RepC protein supported the in vitro replication of pT181 cop608 DNA in the presence of cell-free extracts made from wild-type S. aureus (Fig.1). The reaction products consisted of SC and OC forms of the DNA as well as replication intermediates. However, cell-free extracts made from the S. aureus pcrA3 mutant were inactive in pT181 replication (Fig. 1). The addition of purified PcrA protein to the mutant extracts restored in vitro replication of pT181 DNA (Fig. 1). The different levels of supercoiled DNA observed in this experiment may be due to differences in the activity of topoisomerases in the wild-type and mutant crude extracts. These results showed that the PcrA helicase of S. aureus is the only replication protein defective in the pcrA3 mutant and that the purified PcrA protein is biologically active. Because the native unfused PcrA protein from S. aureus has not been purified, we have assumed in this study that the His-tagged PcrA is as active as the wild-type enzyme. The S. aureusPcrA had an NTPase activity that efficiently hydrolyzed ATP (Fig.2 A) as well as dATP (Fig.2 B). PcrA also hydrolyzed other nucleotides such as dGTP, dCTP, and TTP (not shown). The ATPase activity was not affected in the presence of either the RepC initiator protein or SC pT181cop608 DNA (Fig. 2 A). However, the ATPase activity was stimulated when both the pT181cop608 DNA and the RepC protein were included in the reactions (Fig. 2 A). This is likely due to the “activation” of the DNA unwinding activity of PcrA in the presence of a RepC-generated nick at the pT181 origin of replication (see below). The ATPase activity of PcrA was also significantly stimulated in the presence of ssDNA (Fig.2 B). As discussed earlier, PcrA is expected to act as a helicase during the RC replication of plasmids. We tested the helicase activity of PcrA as well as its directionality using several oligonucleotides representing various regions of the pT181 origin (Table I). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that PcrA unwound a ds oligonucleotide containing a 5′ ss tail (oligonucleotide 1) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). However, it had an ∼10-fold weaker helicase activity with oligonucleotide 2 that contained a 3′ ss tail (Fig. 3B). Results similar to those shown in Fig. 3 (A and B) were obtained when additional oligonucleotides with 5′ or 3′ tails, respectively, were used in these experiments (data not shown). As expected, no DNA unwinding was observed in the absence of ATP. A ds 30-mer oligonucleotide containing 4-nt-long 5′ overhangs at both ends (oligonucleotide 3) was as efficiently unwound as oligonucleotide 1 by PcrA (Fig. 3 C), demonstrating that 4 nt are sufficient for the loading of PcrA onto the 5′ end of the DNA. PcrA failed to unwind a blunt-ended ds oligonucleotide (data not shown), demonstrating a requirement for an ss region for its helicase activity. To rule out the possibility of any contamination from E. coli helicases in the PcrA preparation, proteins from the host strain lacking the PcrA gene were subjected to mock purification through a nickel affinity column. The eluted fractions from this column did not contain any detectable helicase activity (data not shown). The observation that nicked OC form of pT181 DNA accumulates inpcrA3 mutants suggests that PcrA is required for the unwinding of SC pT181 DNA that has been nicked at the origin by RepC (14Iordanescu S. Basheer R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1183-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This postulate was tested by incubating SC pT181cop608DNA with PcrA in the presence and absence of RepC. As expected, PcrA by itself did not unwind SC pT181 DNA (Fig.4). Incubation of pT181cop608DNA with RepC resulted in the generation of relaxed, covalently closed circular DNA as well as nicked OC DNA. The covalently closed circular DNA migrates faster than the SC DNA in agarose gels in the presence of ethidium bromide (Fig. 4). The DNA migrating slower than the OC form presumably corresponds to dimers of OC DNA. When pT181cop608DNA was incubated with both PcrA and RepC, a new band migrating faster than the relaxed covalently closed circular DNA was observed (Fig. 4). This form presumably corresponds to the unwound “U” form of the DNA (25Jiang Y. Pogliano J. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, a diffused band corresponding to OC DNA possibly with various extent of unwinding was obtained (Fig. 4). These forms of DNA were sensitive to nuclease S1 treatment, suggesting that they contained extensive ss regions (Fig. 4). Under the same conditions of S1 treatment, the SC and OC forms of pT181cop608 DNA were mostly unaffected, whereas the ss M13 DNA was totally digested (Fig.4). These data showed that the conversion of pT181 DNA to the more quickly migrating U form as well as more slowly migrating unwound forms is dependent upon both PcrA and RepC. No fully ssDNA that migrates much faster than the U form was observed in the presence of both RepC and PcrA (data not shown), suggesting that PcrA is unable to fully unwind RepC-nicked pT181 DNA. During the initiation of pT181 RC replication, RepC nicks at the origin, the replisome presumably assembles at the nick, and replication proceeds upon unwinding of the DNA by PcrA. We wished to determine whether unwinding of the nicked pT181 DNA by PcrA requires the presence of RepC covalently attached to the nick site. For this, pT181 DNA was first nicked and relaxed by RepC, and the protein was removed by treatment with proteinase K and phenol extraction. Incubation of PcrA with the OC pT181 DNA did not result in the generation of any unwound DNA (Fig.5 A), suggesting that unwinding by PcrA from the RepC-generated nick requires the presence of RepC covalently attached to the nicked DNA. In addition to nicking the pT181 origin, the RepC protein binds noncovalently to the origin through a sequence-specific interaction (26Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We wished to determine whether this interaction is important for the recruitment of PcrA helicase to the pT181 origin. The RepC protein contains separate DNA binding and nicking-closing domains, and we have previously shown that these two activities of RepC can be mutationally uncoupled (27Dempsey L.A. Birch P. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3083-3087Cros"
https://openalex.org/W1972425265,"Myoglobin is an α-helical globular protein that contains two highly conserved tryptophan residues located at positions 7 and 14 in the N-terminal region of the protein. Replacement of both indole residues with phenylalanine residues, i.e. W7F/W14F, results in the expression of an unstable, not correctly folded protein that does not bind the prosthetic group. Here we report data (Congo red and thioflavine T binding assay, birefringence, and electron microscopy) showing that the double Trp/Phe replacements render apomyoglobin molecules highly susceptible to aggregation and amyloid-like fibril formation under physiological conditions in which most of the wild-type protein is in the native state. In refolding experiments, like the wild-type protein, the W7F/W14F apomyoglobin mutant formed a soluble, partially folded helical state between pH 2.0 and pH 4.0. A pH increase from 4.0 to 7.0 restored the native structure only in the case of the wild-type protein and determined aggregation of W7F/W14F. The circular dichroism spectrum recorded immediately after neutralization showed that the polypeptide consists mainly of β-structures. In conclusion, under physiological pH conditions, some mutations that affect folding may cause protein aggregation and the formation of amyloid-like fibrils.

In conclusion, under physiological pH conditions, some mutations that affect folding may cause protein aggregation and the formation of amyloid-like fibrils. Such chronic disorders as Alzheimer's disease, senile systemic amyloidosis, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and dialysis-related amyloidosis are characterized by the extracellular deposition of insoluble protein aggregates known as amyloid fibrils (1Tan S.Y.

About 20 proteins are now known to be involved in the generation of amyloid in vivo. Fibril formation is initiatedin vitro under conditions that stabilize partially unfolded soluble intermediates of the native proteins either after the partial destabilization of physiologically folded proteins in the case of globular proteins (7Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) or after the partial stabilization (i.e. folding) of random coil polypeptide chains in the case of natively unfolded proteins (8Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Despite substantial differences in both sequence and length (from 40 to 250 residues), all the proteins responsible for amyloid deposition form fibrils composed of β-strands oriented perpendicularly to the long axis of the fibril (9Sunde M. Blake C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopy shows that the fibrils are straight and unbranched and are 40–120 Å in diameter (9Sunde M. Blake C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jimenez J.L. Guijarro J.L. Orlova E. Zurdo J. Dobson C.M. Sunde M. Saibil H.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Also proteins not known to be associated with amyloid disease may form amyloid fibrils under in vitro conditions that favor partially folded states (11Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A.

These states are more prone to aggregation than the native state because hydrophobic residues, which are largely buried within the core of the native protein, become more exposed upon partial unfolding. The way in which proteins aggregate in the test tube is remarkably similar to how proteins form the so-called “amyloid” deposits. Even myoglobin, an ordinary all-α globular protein, can form fibrils containing β-strands under experimental conditions that favor the formation of partially folded states (15Fandrich M. Fletcher M.A. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Thus, amyloid formation does not appear to be restricted to a small number of protein sequences but is rather a property common to many, if not all, polypeptide chains. Recent experimental data show that some human genetic amyloid diseases are due to point mutations that cause incomplete protein folding, thereby increasing the propensity of the polypeptide chain to aggregate (16Chen C.D. Huff M.E. Matteson J. Page L. Phillips R. Kelly J.W. Balch W.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6277-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 17Kazmirski S.L. Isaacson R.L. An C. Buckle A. Johnson C.M.

The folding of this protein proceeds through compact intermediates that have been detected in both equilibrium and kinetic experiments. At least three partially folded intermediates, which differ in the amount of their secondary structure, have been detected at low pH in the presence of different anions (18Hughson F.M. Wright P.E. Baldwin R.L. Science. 1990; 249: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 19Sirangelo I. Bismuto E. Tavassi S. Irace G. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 1998; 276: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in studies of methanol-induced conformational transitions (22Babu K.R. Douglas D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14702-14710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In these intermediates, A, G, and H helices are folded as in the native state, whereas the remainder of the molecule seems to be unordered. We previously showed that the simultaneous substitution of the two tryptophan residues at positions 7 and 14 along the A helix with phenylalanine residues causes incorrect folding and a subsequent loss of heme binding. This suggests that the tryptophan residues play an important role in driving the folding process and in determining the structure of apomyoglobin (23Sirangelo I. Tavassi S. Martelli P.L. Casadio R. Irace G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulation indicated that this is probably due to distortions introduced into the compact AGH subdomain, which influence the subsequent steps of the folding pathway (23Sirangelo I. Tavassi S. Martelli P.L. Casadio R. Irace G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to further investigate the conformational properties of the W7F/W14F apomyoglobin mutant. The main finding is that the amino acid replacements render the protein highly susceptible to aggregation and formation of amyloid-like fibrils under experimental conditions not drastically different from the natural setting. Thus, W7F/W14F is a model system with which to investigate the relationship between folding and misfolding at molecular level and to identify the specific interactions that are involved in amyloid formation. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Genset Oligos, Taq polymerase and ligase from Promega, and restriction endonuclease from New England Biolabs. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose was obtained from Qiagen. Congo red and thioflavin T were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The His-tagged version of the myoglobin W7F/W14F mutant was obtained in two steps. First, plasmid pMb413 (24Springer A. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8961-8965Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) was mutated in both tryptophan residues (23Sirangelo I. Tavassi S. Martelli P.L. Casadio R. Irace G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); then, the mutated gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to create an in-frame fusion with the vector pQE-30 (Qiagen) sequence that encodes a His6 tag at the N terminus. The upstream primer was designed to delete the stop codon region and the PstI restriction site of the parental pMb413 plasmid and to introduce the Bam H1 restriction site. The primers used were 5′-AGG AGA ACA ACA GGA TCC GTT CTG TCT GAA-3′ and 5′-GAG CTC GGT ACC TCA TTA ACC CTG GTA ACC-3′ for forward and reverse sequences, respectively (regions complementary to the synthetic myoglobin gene are underlined; the BamH1 site introduced is indicated in bold letters). The PCR was conducted for 30 cycles of heat denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s; the primers were annealed to the DNA at 60 °C for 1 min, and the DNA chain was extended withTaq polymerase at 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR was performed also with the wild-type myoglobin gene. The PCR products were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and alcohol precipitation. The DNAs were digested withBamH1 and KpnI, separated on 1.5% agarose gel, and extracted by means of the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The DNA fragments were sub-cloned into the pQE30 vector digested withBamH1 and KpnI and then transformed intoEscherichia coli strain M15[pREP4]. Recombinant plasmids were identified by restriction endonuclease analysis, and clones containing the correct-size insert were sequenced by dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. The E. coliM15[pREP4] cells containing plasmid pQE-30/Mb were grown by shaking at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth containing 0.125 mg/ml ampicillin until A 600 reached 0.5–0.7. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubation was continued for 4 h. The culture was then centrifuged at 9000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The wild-type His-tagged myoglobin was produced in soluble form and then purified under native conditions, whereas the mutant His-tag myoglobin was sequestered into insoluble inclusion bodies and purified under denaturing conditions. In particular, the bacterial pellet of the mutant myoglobin was re-suspended in lysis buffer (100 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris·HCl, 8.0m urea, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. After centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 30 min, the supernatant was mixed to a slurry of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and incubated on a rotary shaker for 1 h at room temperature. The lysate-resin mixture was packed into an empty column and washed twice with 100 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris·HCl, 8.0m urea, 10 mm imidazole, pH 6.3. The protein was eluted 4 times with 100 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris·HCl, 8.0m urea, pH 4.5. The fractions were collected and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The protein was concentrated using an Amicon concentrator and folded by dialysis against 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, containing decreasing concentrations of urea to 0 m. Wild-type apomyoglobin was prepared from myoglobin by the 2-butanone extraction procedure described by Teale (25Teale F.W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 35: 543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Contamination of the apoprotein by myoglobin was assessed spectrophotometrically. Apomyoglobin concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard and/or measuring absorption at 280 and 275 nm for the wild-type and mutant protein, respectively. The molar extinction coefficients ε280 = 13,500m−1 cm−1 and ε275 = 3,750 m−1 cm−1, calculated from tryptophan and tyrosine content (27Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar), were used. The binding of Congo red was monitored using absorption spectroscopy. A 5.0 mm stock solution of Congo red was prepared in 5.0 mmKH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Congo red solution (5.0 × 10−6m) was mixed with protein suspension (8.0 × 10−6m) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before absorption measurements. The difference spectra (Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer) were obtained by subtracting the Congo red spectra obtained in the absence of protein from the Congo red spectra measured in the presence of protein. Poly-l-lysine solution was used as positive control (28Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Drops of protein suspension were air-dried on gelatin-coated slides. The resulting films were stained with a saturated solution of Congo red and sodium chloride and corrected to pH 10.0 with NaOH (11Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). The stained slides were washed and air-dried before being examined with a Zeiss Axioskope 2 light microscope between cross-polarizers and imaged by means of a high resolution digital camera (C4742–95, Hamamatsu Photonics, Italy). Samples containing 5 × 10−6m of protein were mixed with 25 × 10−6m thioflavin T in 10 mmphosphate buffer. Thioflavin T fluorescence was recorded from 460 to 500 nm with excitation at 450 nm and slits of 3.5 nm for both excitation and emission. For each sample, the fluorescence intensity at 482 nm was corrected by subtracting the emission intensity recorded before the addition of protein to thioflavin T solutions. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on homogeneous wild-type and W7F/W14F apomyoglobin samples at a concentration of 10 × 10−6m. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled liquid system Neslab RTE-110. Cuvettes of 1-mm path length were used over the wavelength range from 250 to 190 nm. Spectra were acquired at 0.5-nm intervals with a 4-s integration time and a bandwidth of 1.0 nm. An average of three scans was obtained for all spectra. Photomultiplier absorbance did not exceed 600 V in the spectral region analyzed. Data were corrected for buffer contributions and smoothed using the software provided by the manufacturer (System Software version 1.00). All measurements were performed under nitrogen flow. The results are expressed as mean residue ellipticity in units of degree cm2 dmol−1. A mean residue mass of 115 was used for the peptide chromophore. Drops (5 μl) of mutated myoglobin and wild-type apomyoglobin were placed on collodion-amyl-acetate-coated grids and air-dried under germ-free conditions. Samples were stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid for 30 s, then grids were blotted and again air-dried. Images were acquired using a Zeiss TM-109 electron microscope operating at 80-kV excitation voltage. Mammalian myoglobins contain two tryptophan residues at the invariant positions 7 (A-5) and 14 (A-12) in the N-terminal region (A helix) of the protein. We recently showed that the simultaneous substitution of both tryptophan residues with phenylalanine residues results in low expression of an unstable protein, which is unable to bind heme and that cannot be purified by standard procedures (23Sirangelo I. Tavassi S. Martelli P.L. Casadio R. Irace G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Homogeneous W7F/W14F recombinant myoglobin was obtained after extraction of the histidine-tagged protein from inclusion bodies and purified under denaturing conditions, i.e. 8.0 murea, as reported under “Experimental Procedures.” Removal of denaturant by extensive dialysis against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, determined the formation of protein aggregates. By contrast, the histidine-tagged wild-type myoglobin was obtained as a soluble, native-like folded polypeptide chain as documented by far UV-CD spectrum and Soret absorption. Congo red is a diazo dye that is widely used to identify amyloid deposits because of its ability to bind preferentially to aggregated amyloid peptides/proteins but not to the native, unassembled forms (28Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 29Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P.

We performed Congo red binding experiments to determine whether the W7F/W14F aggregates formed at neutral pH and at 25 °C are amyloid structures. Congo red binding is detected as a red shift in its absorbance spectrum and as birefringence under polarized light due to the strong intercalation of the dye into the ordered, intermolecular β-pleated sheet structure of amyloid fibrils (28Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 31Missmahal H.P. Mandema E. Ruinen L. Scholten J.H. Cohen A.S. Amyloidosis. Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam1968: 22-29Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the absorption spectrum of Congo red in the presence of W7F/W14F at neutral pH compared with that recorded without protein and the difference spectrum. A significant red shift from 494 to 550 nm occurred immediately upon binding of the dye to the W7F/W14F apomyoglobin mutant. The wild-type protein did not affect the Congo red spectrum. The development of birefringence under cross-polarized light is highly diagnostic for amyloid (31Missmahal H.P. Mandema E. Ruinen L. Scholten J.H. Cohen A.S. Amyloidosis. Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam1968: 22-29Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the optical microscope image obtained under cross-polarized light of W7F/W14F aggregates stained with Congo red. The figure shows the characteristic birefringence in correspondence to regions rich in amyloid fibrils. We obtained negative controls by adding Congo red to wild-type protein. Thioflavin T is a fluorescent dye that detects amyloid fibrils (32Naiki H. Higuchi K. Nakakuki K. Takeda T. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 104-110PubMed Google Scholar,33Tjernberg L.O. Callaway D.J.E.

The emission intensity of the dye increases significantly upon binding to the linear array of β-strands in amyloid fibrils (34LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 35Samuel D. Kumar T.K.S. Balamurugan K. Lin W.Y. Chin D.H. Yu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4134-4141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We examined changes in the emission intensity of thioflavin T in the presence of wild-type apomyoglobin and of the W7F/W14F mutant at neutral pH and at 25 °C. The emission intensity of the dye at 485 nm increased 6-fold upon the addition of the fluorophore to W7F/W14F. Thirty days later the emission intensity was 20-fold higherversus the free fluorophore. There was no increase for the wild-type apomyoglobin. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of amyloid-like fibrils in W7F/W14F samples at pH 7.0 (Fig. 3,C and D); these fibrils had a mean diameter of 5–10 nm and a mean length between 500 and 800 nm. No fibrils were detected in the wild-type apomyoglobin samples. To further probe the aggregation process of apomyoglobin, we examined the relationship between pH and far-UV CD activity. It is well known that the conformation of apomyoglobin depends on both pH and salt concentration (18Hughson F.M. Wright P.E. Baldwin R.L. Science. 1990; 249: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 36Goto Y. Fink A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 803-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 37Bismuto E. Sirangelo I. Irace G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Sirangelo I. Bismuto E. Irace G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Specifically, it is native at neutral pH and fully unfolded at pH 2.0 in the presence of very low amounts of salt. The addition of 0.3 m NaCl to fully unfolded apomyoglobin or a pH increase from 2.0 to 4.0 at low ionic strength results in the formation of a partially folded form that is similar to the kinetic intermediate identified on the folding pathway (19Sirangelo I. Bismuto E. Tavassi S. Irace G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Jennings P.A. Wright P.E. Science. 1993; 262: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). At pH 2.0 and at a low salt concentration, both the wild type and W7F/W14F apomyoglobin were essentially unfolded as documented by a negative peak at 200–202 nm (Fig. 4). A pH increase from 2.0 to 4.0 caused the appearance of a significant amount of α-helical structure in both proteins. In fact, their CD spectra showed the characteristic minima at 222 and 208 nm (Fig. 4). The analysis of CD data by Yang's algorithm (39Yang J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) produced the following secondary structure percentages for the wild-type and W7F/W14F apomyoglobin, respectively: helix 44.1, β 0, turn 22.8, and random 33.1, and helix 20.2, β 0, turn 34.5, and random 45.2. These data demonstrate that at pH 4.0 part of the polypeptide chain is organized in α-helical segments. The lower helical percentage observed for W7F/W14F could be related to a higher concentration of unfolded protein in equilibrium with the partially folded helical structures formed at pH 4.0. The CD spectra recorded upon the addition of 0.3 mNaCl to unfolded apoprotein at pH 2.0 were similar to those observed at pH 4.0 in the presence of low salt concentrations. A pH increase from 4.0 to 7.0 restored the far-UV CD typical of the native state only in the case of the wild-type apomyoglobin. The secondary structure percentages of refolded protein were: helix 63.9, β 0, turn 10.5, and random 25.5. By contrast, the CD spectrum of the W7F/W14F apomyoglobin mutant at pH 7.0 shows a negative peak at 216 nm, which is typical of a β-like polypeptide. The estimated secondary structure percentages were: helix 22.1, β 38.6, turn 17.1, and random 22.2. We examined the dependence of apomyoglobin aggregation on pH by monitoring thioflavin T fluorescence. There was no increase of thioflavin T fluorescence for either wild-type or W7F/W14F apomyoglobin at pH 2.0 and 4.0. At pH 7.0, thioflavin T fluorescence rapidly and significantly increased only in the case of W7F/W14F. Myoglobin is a highly soluble globular protein whose native state properties do not suggest a predisposition to form amyloid fibrils. In fact, most of its amino acid sequence is organized in well defined α helices with few or no β-sheet elements (40Evans S.V. Brayer G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4263-4268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, all compact intermediates detected so far in equilibrium and kinetic experiments are predominantly helical (19Sirangelo I. Bismuto E. Tavassi S. Irace G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Jennings P.A. Wright P.E. Science. 1993; 262: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 36Goto Y. Fink A. J. Mol.

Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Apomyoglobin incubated for a long time under experimental conditions that destabilize the native fold, i.e. pH 9.0 and 65 °C, form fibrillar structures that are indistinguishable from disease-related amyloid fibrils (15Fandrich M. Fletcher M.A. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). In this respect, myoglobin resembles other non-disease-related proteins that form amyloid aggregates under conditions favoring molten or partially folded states. It is generally agreed that non-covalent interactions involving the polypeptide chain can occur under mild denaturing conditions, and this may contribute to stabilize β-sheet formation. Here we demonstrate that substitution of both highly conserved tryptophan residues endows the apomyoglobin with a high propensity to rapidly form fibrils under physiological conditions in which most of the wild-type protein is in the native state. In other words, apomyoglobin fibrils of the same type as those associated with amyloid-related diseases are formed in the absence of any physical or chemical agent able to perturb and, hence, destabilize the native state. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increased propensity to aggregate and form fibrils caused by amino acid mutations. One attributes amyloid formation to a shift in the equilibrium between the native state and the ensemble of partially denatured or molten states toward the latter, which is more prone to aggregation (3Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 9: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1698) Google Scholar, 7Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 8Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. J. Biol.

S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). In this case, the enhanced propensity to form fibrils is due to the destabilizing effect caused by the amino acid replacement rather than to the loss or the formation of specific interactions. The second mechanism concerns changes in the aggregation rate of partially denatured or molten proteins caused by the amino acid mutation and is generally applicable to proteins that are essentially unstructured even under physiological conditions (42Chiti F. Taddei N. Bucciantini M. White P. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 43Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 11: 1318-1320Crossref Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is noteworthy that some mutations in prion proteins do not destabilize the protein but do increase the aggregation rate (44Swietnicki W. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31048-31052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 45Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In the case of myoglobin, fully unfolded W7F/W14F becomes partially folded when the pH is increased from 2.0 to 4.0 or when 0.3 m sodium chloride is added to the samples, but fibril formation does not occur, at least within the time of our observation. A further pH increase from 4.0 to 7.0 determined aggregation and the formation of highly organized amyloid fibrils. We cannot say which mechanism operates in the case of myoglobin until we identify the main kinetic component underlying amyloid formation. It could be unfolded or partially folded populations or both. The overall picture is that the two Trp/Phe substitutions make apomyoglobin more susceptible to aggregation; however, this is prevented at low pH because of the electrostatic repulsion. On raising the pH from 4.0 to 7.0, the net charge of the polypeptide chain decreases, and this favors the aggregation process. Thus, two factors appear crucial for fibril formation in the case of W7F/W14F; they are non-covalent interactions and charge effects. Experimental and theoretical evidence indicates that apomyoglobin folding occurs through a nucleation site formed by the confluence of the A, G, and H helices (46Hughson F.M. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4415-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 47Kay M.S. Baldwin R.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 48Tirado-Rivers J. Jorgensen W.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4175-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 49Eliezer D.

Therefore, incorrect GH and AH pairings influence the subsequent folding pattern. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the double tryptophan mutation in helix A promotes a substantial distortion and disruption of helix G that results in protein destabilization (23Sirangelo I. Tavassi S. Martelli P.L. Casadio R. Irace G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The data reported herein corroborate the concept that formation of the AGH subdomain is a key step in apomyoglobin folding. In fact, distortions among the helices in this subdomain prevent the polypeptide from proceeding through the subsequent steps of the folding pathway.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped aerobic bacterium that is found ubiquitously in the environment (1Vasil M.L. J. Pediatr. 1986; 108: 800-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and is an opportunistic human pathogen that secretes a number of potent virulence factors, including exotoxin A (ETA). 1The abbreviations used for: ETA, exotoxin A; β-TAD, β-methylene-thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide; 5-AF, 5-acetamide fluorescein; ADPRT, ADP-ribosyltransferase; AEDANS, 5-(2-aminoethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid; bis-Tris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; IAEDANS, 5-(2-iodoacetylaminoethylamino)-1-napthalenesulfonic acid; eEF-2, eukaryotic elongation factor-2; eEF-2-AF, 5-AF labeled eEF-2; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GDP-β-S, guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); GTP-γ-S, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); KA , substrate binding (association) constant; KD , substrate binding (dissociation) constant; o-GTP, oxidized GTP; PE24H, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, 24-kDa C-terminal fragment containing a hexa-His tag. 1The abbreviations used for: ETA, exotoxin A; β-TAD, β-methylene-thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide; 5-AF, 5-acetamide fluorescein; ADPRT, ADP-ribosyltransferase; AEDANS, 5-(2-aminoethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid; bis-Tris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; IAEDANS, 5-(2-iodoacetylaminoethylamino)-1-napthalenesulfonic acid; eEF-2, eukaryotic elongation factor-2; eEF-2-AF, 5-AF labeled eEF-2; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GDP-β-S, guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); GTP-γ-S, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); KA , substrate binding (association) constant; KD , substrate binding (dissociation) constant; o-GTP, oxidized GTP; PE24H, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, 24-kDa C-terminal fragment containing a hexa-His tag. The production of ETA by this bacterium, along with many other virulence factors, allows it to adapt to quite diverse environments including soil, water, sewage, and hospitals. Patients at a high risk for bacterial colonization and subsequent infection include those who are jeopardized by extreme youth or age, severe trauma, AIDS, burns, cystic fibrosis, and cancer (2Van Delden C. Iglewski B.H. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1998; 4: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). ETA belongs to the family of enzymes termed mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferases and is more specifically a NAD+-diphthamide ADP-ribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.36) (3Domenighini M. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,4Althaus F.R. Richter C. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 37: 1-237PubMed Google Scholar). ETA, a 66-kDa extracellular protein (5Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), enters eukaryotic cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis (6Sanyal G. Marquis-Omer D. Gress J.O. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3488-3497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and once it has reached the cytoplasm catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of its target protein, eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) (7Beattie B.K. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9042-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This ADP-ribosylation reaction inactivates eEF-2 resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis and ultimately leading to cellular death (5Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8Yates S.P. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35029-35036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of ETA shows that it consists of three distinct functional domains: receptor-binding (domain I), translocation (domain II), and catalysis (domain III) (9Allured V.S.

The catalytic domain (residues 400–613) is responsible for the inactivation of eEF-2 by catalyzing the transfer of the ADP-ribosyl moiety from NAD+to eEF-2. It is proposed that initially a binary complex forms between NAD+ and the catalytic domain followed by the subsequent binding of eEF-2, representative of an ordered sequential reaction (11Li M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19107-19111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, stereochemical and kinetic data suggest that the reaction mechanism is likely an S N1 nucleophilic substitution involving an oxocarbonium cation, despite the observed inversion of configuration for the glycosidic bond formed between the ribose and diphthamide (5Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This inversion most likely results because the anomeric carbon of the nicotinamide ribose is susceptible to a backside nucleophilic attack from the N-1 of the imidazole portion of diphthamide (5Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The important catalytic residues for ETA are Glu-553, His-440, Tyr-481, and Tyr-470, which were identified by structural and mutagenesis studies (9Allured V.S. Collier R.J. Carroll S.F. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 13Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 679-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The structure of the catalytic domain shows that the imidazole side chain of His-440, located at the base of the active site cleft, hydrogen bonds with the AMP ribose moiety of NAD+ and with the main chain carbonyl of Tyr-470 (13Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The nicotinamide ring stacks with Tyr-481 and Tyr-470 and is located near the nicotinamide where it is involved in Van der Waals interactions with the thiazole-ribose moiety of the nonhydrolyzable NAD+analogue, β-TAD. Glu-553 forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen of the thiazole-ribose of β-TAD (11Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9308-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and may serve to cradle NAD+ in a reactive conformation, exposing the anomeric carbon for attack by the diphthamide of eEF-2 while still allowing the inversion of configuration at this carbon. Additionally, the negatively charged carboxylate of Glu-553 may stabilize a positively charged reaction intermediate (13Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). eEF-2 is a single polypeptide chain with a molecular mass ranging from 90 to 110 kDa depending on the source of its isolation (15Giovane A. Servillo L. Quagliuolo L. Balestrieri C. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). eEF-2 is a factor involved in the elongation phase of protein synthesis and is a member of the GTPase superfamily. Specifically, eEF-2 is responsible for catalyzing the translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site within the ribosome, movement of the deacylated tRNA from the P-site to the E-site, and finally movement of the mRNA to allow the next codon to be placed in the A-site (16Nygård O. Nilsson L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). eEF-2 contains a post-translationally modified histidine residue, 2-[3-carboxyamido-3-(trimethylammonio)propyl]histidine, referred to as diphthamide (17Mattheakis L.C. Shen W.H. Collier R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4026-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Iglewski W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This residue is located at position 715 in the rat liver eEF-2 sequence near the C terminus of the protein (19Lavergne J.P. Marzouki A. Reboud A.M. Reboud J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1048: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Diphthamide has only been found in eEF-2 and is completely conserved throughout all eukaryotic and archaebacterial evolution (18Iglewski W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Perentesis J.P. Phan L.D. Gleason W.B. LaPorte D.C. Livingston D.M. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1190-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the diphthamide is the site of toxin attack, it does not appear to be necessary for normal eEF-2 function. Currently, no three-dimensional structure has been reported for eEF-2, which may help to explain the lack of understanding regarding the toxin-eEF-2 interaction. The aim of the present study was to investigate the physiological conditions requisite for the interaction between eEF-2 and the catalytic domain of ETA using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach. We introduced single cysteine residues into the catalytic domain of ETA and labeled the domain with a donor fluorophore, whereas the protein substrate, eEF-2 was labeled with the acceptor fluorophore. The integrity of the labeled toxins was assessed through enzyme activity and substrate binding measurements. Furthermore, the dissociation constant for eEF-2 binding to the toxin was also determined. This binding event was shown to be pH-dependent but insensitive to the ionic strength of the aqueous environment and to the presence of the substrate, NAD+. Finally, the importance of the conformation of eEF-2 on toxin ADP-ribosylation activity was evaluated using GTP and GDP nonhydrolyzable analogues. The catalytic fragment of ETA with a C-terminal 6-His tag (PE24H) was overexpressed and purified as described (21Armstrong S. Merrill A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) except that all cysteine-containing mutant proteins required the chelate-agarose affinity column to be charged with 100 mm ZnSO4. eEF-2 was purified from wheat germ as previously described (21Armstrong S. Merrill A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Single cysteine mutant proteins were created using either Kunkel mutagenesis (22Steer B.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7225-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or by standard QuikChange™ mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The DNA template was the plasmid pPH1 containing the gene for wild-type PE24H. The desired mutation, determined by dideoxy sequencing with an ABI Prism Model 377 DNA sequencer using dye termination and cycle sequencing, was analyzed on a 4.5% acrylamide gel. The PE24H protein was labeled with the fluorophore IAEDANS as detailed earlier (8Yates S.P. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35029-35036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The labeling efficiency, based on the appropriate absorbance and molar extinction coefficients of the bound fluorophore and the measured protein, ranged between 80 and 100%, with the exception of S408C, which was only 60%. Purified wheat germ eEF-2 protein was labeled with 5-iodoacetamide fluorescein as described previously (8Yates S.P. Merrill A.R. J. Biol.

All steady-state fluorescence measurements were obtained using a PTI Alphascan spectrophotometer interfaced with a computer using Felix™ Version 1.21 software (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ) and equipped with a water-jacketed sample chamber set to 25 °C. The exceptions were the determination of the pH profile for eEF-2 binding and the effects of guanyl nucleotides on binding, for which we used a Cary Eclipse fluorometer (Varian, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) equipped with a Peltier thermostatted multicell holder at 25 °C. The PE24H-AEDANS excitation (λem = 480 nm) and emission spectra (λex = 337 nm) were recorded for proteins in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) solution. The eEF-2-AF excitation (λem = 515 nm) and emission spectra (λex = 492 nm) were obtained for proteins in 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) buffer. Absorbance spectra were obtained at room temperature with a PerkinElmer λ-6 double beam, scanning absorption spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) interfaced to a personal computer. PE24H-AEDANS absorbance spectra were scanned from 260 to 400 nm in 50 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) solution. eEF-2-AF absorbance spectra were recorded from 250 to 600 nm in 300 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) buffer. The NAD+-dependent ADPRT activity for the various cysteine PE24H proteins and their corresponding protein adducts was determined as described by Armstrong and Merrill (21Armstrong S. Merrill A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The effect of GTP- and GDP-bound eEF-2 was assessed with the substrates ε-NAD+ (500 μm) GTP-γ-S, and eEF-2 (14 μm; with or without bound guanyl nucleotides) held at saturating levels. The assay was as described above except that the nucleotides (GDP-β-S at 50 μm, Sigma) were initially allowed to bind to eEF-2 for 10 min at 25 °C and the reaction buffer was supplemented with 8 mm MgCl2. The NAD+-dependent quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in PE24H was used to determine the binding constant (K D) for NAD+ as described elsewhere (5Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The FRET-based assay was conducted as described previously (8Yates S.P. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35029-35036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for eEF-2 binding with PE24H was determined using the following equation as part of the nonlinear fitting function of Origin 6.1 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA): ΔFi/ΔF max = ([eEF-2] × Bmax)/(K D + [eEF-2]), where ΔFi is the change in fluorescence intensity for each ligand (eEF-2) concentration upon macromolecular association, ΔF max is the maximum change in fluorescence intensity at saturation of the ligand-binding site within PE24H, K D is the dissociation constant for the binding of eEF-2 with PE24H, and Bmax is the total PE24H concentration (number of binding sites, as there is 1 site/protein). S585C-AEDANS was chosen as the control protein to evaluate the effects of NAD+, urea, salt, pH, and guanyl nucleotides on toxin-eEF-2 binding. S585C and its adduct behave similarly to the wild-type enzyme in terms of its catalytic activity and NAD+ binding; also this protein labeled with IAEDANS at a high efficiency. The requirement of NAD+ for protein complexation was evaluated using the nonhydrolyzable analogue, β-TAD, at a concentration of 200 μm. The ability of denatured PE24H-AEDANS to bind eEF-2-AF was evaluated in buffer containing 4m urea (Pierce), which denatures the PE24H protein but does not unfold the eEF-2 protein. The effect of various anions on eEF-2 binding to PE24H was measured by varying the salt concentration from 0 to 800 mm in the binding buffer. The Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm, pH 7.9) was supplemented with KCl, Na2SO4, or NaF. The effect of pH on the binding was obtained by varying the pH between 4 and 12. The buffer contained 50 mm NaCl, and the buffering components (pH range shown in parentheses) were sodium acetate (30 mm, pH 4), bis-Tris (30 mm, pH 6.5–6.8), Tris-HCl (30 mm, pH 7–8.8), and CAPS (30 mm, pH 9–12). The K D values were converted to KA values for plotting purposes using the expression, KA = 1/K D. The effects of guanyl nucleotides bound to eEF-2-AF was assessed in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) supplemented with 8 mm MgCl2 with either 50 μmGTP-γ-S or GDP-β-S (Sigma). eEF-2-AF was preincubated with the nonhydrolyzable guanyl nucleotides (at 50 μm) for 10 min before titration with the toxin. The saturating concentration of these nucleotides is near 50 μm (23Sontag B. Reboud A.M. Divita G. Di Pietro A. Guillot D. Reboud J.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1976-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Intrinsic fluorescence-based techniques for studying the interactions between PE24H and eEF-2 have proved difficult because both proteins possess tryptophan fluorescence. The catalytic domain of ETA, PE24H, does not contain any native cysteine residues. Therefore, single cysteine residues were introduced into the protein at defined sites within the toxin. The sites chosen for mutagenesis included those that surround the NAD+-binding site as well as surface-exposed sites distant from the active site (Fig.1). All mutant proteins were used to assess the interactions between the toxin and eEF-2. The thiol-specific reaction between the cysteine residues within PE24H and the fluorophore, IAEDANS, created proteins that contained a single, covalently linked reporter fluorophore. AEDANS was chosen as the fluorophore because of its large Stokes shift and because it has an emission spectrum that overlaps well with the absorbance of other fluorescent dyes such as fluorescein. AEDANS is ideal for FRET experiments of up to ∼60 Å (24Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). The structural integrity of the mutant PE24H proteins with and without the attached fluorophore was assessed by both NAD+substrate binding and ADPRT enzymatic activity. None of the single cysteine replacements in PE24H led to significant changes in either the affinity for the NAD+ substrate or in ADPRT activity (TableI). Generally, introduction of the fluorophore also did not cause major perturbations of the proteins as reflected by measurements of the transferase and binding activities of the mutant adduct proteins (Table II). However, T442C-, S449C-, and E486C-AEDANS showed reduced ADPRT activity upon alkylation (84-, 16-, and 12-fold decrease, respectively) (TableII). Thr-442, situated on the same β-strand as His-440, and Ser-449, located in an α-helix near the opening of the active site cleft, both hydrogen bond with NAD+ (11Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I.

Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35029-35036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Therefore, the decreased activity of these three mutant proteins is likely a reflection of the spatial importance of these residues for catalytic function; when the AEDANS fluorophore is present at these sites within the corresponding protein adducts, it may sterically interfere with normal enzyme function.Table IComparison of the ADPRT activity and NAD+-binding affinity for the cysteine replacement mutantsProteink catK D(NAD+)min−1μmWild type675 ± 8555 ± 6S408C630 ± 10859 ± 3S410C184 ± 3150 ± 6T442C132 ± 3335 ± 3S449C234 ± 42129 ± 7S459C310 ± 11355 ± 10E486C930 ± 12757 ± 8S507C1256 ± 6163 ± 2S515C307 ± 7848 ± 5S585C731 ± 14561 ± 4The kinetics and binding data were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.

The kinetics and binding data were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. A typical UV-visible absorption spectrum for PE24H-AEDANS is shown in Fig. 2 A. It is characterized by maxima at 260, 285, and 337 nm; the latter peak was used to determine the labeling stoichiometry of the various PE24H-AEDANS adducts. Also, the fluorescence spectra for PE24H-AEDANS (Fig.2 C) show excitation and emission maxima for PE24H-AEDANS at 337 and 480 nm, respectively. Alkylation of eEF-2 using 5-iodoacetamide fluorescein was stringently controlled to ensure that only one label was present per protein molecule. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of eEF-2-AF is characterized by two absorption maxima at 280 and 490 nm (Fig. 2 B). The fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2 D) show excitation and emission maxima at 492 and 515 nm, respectively. Introducing a fluorescence moiety into eEF-2 leads to a 4-fold loss in its ability to act as a substrate in the ADPRT assay with wild-type PE24H as the enzyme (data not shown). The fluorescence emission spectrum of the PE24H-AEDANS fluorophore significantly overlaps with the absorption spectrum of eEF-2-AF; therefore, these fluorophores are a good donor-acceptor pair for FRET studies involving PE24H and eEF-2 (Fig. 2, B and C). The protein-protein interactions of these two proteins were measured by FRET between the AEDANS moiety in PE24H (donor) and the fluorescein fluorophore associated with eEF-2 (acceptor). The energy transfer is evident in Fig.3 A, as the emission for PE24H-AEDANS was monitored as a function of labeled eEF-2 concentration. A plot showing the binding isotherm for PE24H-AEDANS with eEF-2-AF is shown in Fig. 3 B, which is indicative of specific, saturable binding between these two proteins. In addition, the binding was assessed when PE24H-AEDANS was chemically denatured with urea (Fig. 3 B). PE24H-AEDANS is completely unfolded in 4 m urea (25Beattie B.K. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15646-15654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); however, eEF-2-AF, a more structurally stable protein, remains in its native folded state at this denaturant concentration (data not shown). As shown by the data in Fig.3 B, no FRET occurs between denatured PE24H-AEDANS and folded eEF-2-AF, thereby providing evidence that the FRET assay is a good measure of the specific nature for the association between the toxin and eEF-2. The inset to Fig. 3 B shows a decrease in the fluorescence intensity at 460 nm as the concentration ratio of eEF-2-AF and PE24H-AEDANS approaches unity with no further change once the stoichiometry is about 2.5:1 (eEF-2:PE24H). These findings are indicative of a specific interaction between the two proteins characterized by tight binding. Binding constants for this protein-protein interaction were determined (Table II) and ranged from 0.8 to 1.9 μm for the various labeled mutant proteins. Using this FRET-based assay, the requirement of NAD+ for the binding of eEF-2 to PE24H was also assessed. To form a stable PE24H-eEF-2-NAD+ complex that is incapable of completing the transferase reaction, the nonhydrolyzable analogue of NAD+, β-TAD, was used. The binding of eEF-2 to PE24H was examined both in the absence and presence of β-TAD. The similarity in the binding isotherms (Fig. 3 B) was indicative that PE24H does not require NAD+ in order to associate with eEF-2. The eEF-2 binding constants were determined to be 2.7 (± 0.3) and 1.9 (± 0.2) μm, respectively, for the presence and absence of β-TAD. The effect of KCl concentration on the interaction between PE24H and eEF-2 was also investigated. Surprisingly, eEF-2 binding to PE24H was not significantly influenced by increases in KCl concentration (Fig.4 A), with theK D varying only slightly, from 2.0 to 1.3 μm, for S585C-AEDANS binding with the translocase protein, which represents a 1.5-fold increase in affinity. Similarly, Na2SO4 and NaF had no influence on the association of these proteins (data not shown). Therefore, the protein-protein interaction that is such an integral part of the catalytic mechanis"
https://openalex.org/W1966308807,"Trypanosomes are protozoan parasites that have a major impact on health. This family diverged very early from the eukaryotic lineage and possesses unique RNA processing mechanisms such as trans-splicing and RNA editing. The trypanosome signal recognition particle (SRP) has a unique composition compared with all known SRP complexes, because it contains two RNA molecules, the 7SL RNA and a tRNA-like molecule. RNA interference was utilized to elucidate the essentiality of the SRP pathway and its role in protein translocation in Trypanosoma brucei. The production of double stranded RNA specific for the signal peptide-binding protein SRP54 induced the degradation of the mRNA and a loss of the SRP54 protein. SRP54 depletion elicited inhibition in growth and cytokinesis, suggesting that the SRP pathway is essential. The translocation of four signal peptide-containing proteins was examined. Surprisingly, the proteins were translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum and properly processed. However, the surface EP procyclin, the lysosomal protein p67, and the flagellar pocket protein CRAM were mislocalized and accumulated in megavesicles, most likely because of a secondary effect on protein sorting. The translocation of these proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum under SRP54 depletion suggests that an alternative pathway for protein translocation exists in trypanosomes."

This activity was found only in the cytosolic fraction and had the biochemical characteristics of a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme, including a requirement for a reducing environment and relatively high affinities for its substrates. After purification, activity was associated with GnT51, a protein with an apparentM r of 51,000 that could be photoaffinity-labeled with a radiolabeled analog of its donor substrate, UDP-GlcNAc. This activity had properties that were distinct from another UDP-GlcNAc PPO-β-GlcNAc-Tase that modifies Ser/Thr residues on many proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus (14Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

In addition to modifying distinct hydroxyamino acids, the latter enzyme is not divalent cation-dependent, and its subunits have larger apparent M r values. GnT51 also appeared to be distinct from an activity thought to link GlcNAc to Thr residues of a cell-surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein in Dictyostelium (16Zachara N.E.

To gain further evidence for the cytoplasmic glycosylation model for Skp1, we have cloned the gene for GnT51 and tested for Skp1 GlcNAc-Tase activity by recombinant expression in Escherichia coli.

GnT51 appears to belong to a different GTase superfamily than the Ser/Thr O-β-GlcNAc-Tase and is distantly related to a family of Golgi type II membrane proteins that initiate mucin-type polypeptide O-glycosylation in the secretory pathway.

Both strands of DNA encoding the first exon of GnT51 (PF9 and PR9) were chemically synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) with terminal extensions suitable for subsequent ligations: PF9, 5′-AGAAGACATATGAATGAAAATTCTATTTTTGTTTCTATTATAAGTTATAGAGATTCCGCATT CTCGAGATAA. PR9 was the reverse complement of PF9 (see Figs. 3 and 4 for primer locations).Figure 4GnT51 gene sequence. The DNA sequence of the region between the start codon of the reverse-oriented, predicted upstream ORF, and the start codon of the downstream ORF, as illustrated in Fig. 3 B, is shown. The predicted GnT51 ORF consists of two exons. Tryptic peptide sequences obtained from the initial MS sequencing (Table I) are bold underlined, and peptides subsequently confirmed from the MS data are inbold. PCR primer positions shown in Fig. 3 areunderlined (note: the degeneracy of PF1 and PF2, the 5′-extensions of PF5 and PR5, and mismatches in PR1 and PR2 (see “Results”) are not shown). Predicted polyadenylation signals in bold are downstream of the stop codon. The position of the intron was concluded as described under “Results.” The sequence shown corresponds to GenBankTM accessionAF375997.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) PF9 and PR9 were annealed, incubated for 1 h at 72 °C with 1 mm dATP and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase in 20 μl, cloned into the T/A-cloning site of pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and amplified inE. coli strain TOP10 One Shot chemically competent cells (Invitrogen). The insert was sequenced in both directions to verify fidelity. Restriction sites present in the insert (underlined) were used to excise and ligate exon 1 between the NdeI andXhoI sites of the expression plasmid pTYB1 (New England Biolabs, MA), resulting in pTYB1-ex1. The second exon of GnT51 was amplified from Dictyostelium discoideum genomic DNA using the primers PF10, 5′-AGTAGTGAATGCGAATGTCAATGGACTATCAAGAATTTAATTGAA, and PR10, 5′-CTATGGCTCTTCAGCATAAACCGATTTGGGATTTAATTACATACTCCATAA. The amplified DNA was cloned into pCR4-TOPO and sequenced as above. The insert was excised with BsmI and SapI (underlined) and ligated directly into the corresponding sites of pTYB1-ex1 (BsmI site derived from PF9, bold), resulting in an in-frame fusion that conserved the authentic amino acid sequence of GnT51 at the junction between exon-1 and exon-2 and a second in-frame fusion between the C terminus of GnT51 and the IMPACT-CN chitin binding domain (CBD) via an intein linker (Ref. 21Chong S. Mersha F.B. Comb D.G. Scott M.E. Landry D. Vence L.M. Perler F.B. Benner J. Kucera R.B. Hirvonen C.A. Pelletier J.J. Paulus H. Xu M.-Q. Gene. 1997; 192: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar; New England Biolabs). This expression plasmid, referred to as pTYB1GnT51, was amplified in TOP10 E. coli cells. pMYB5, which encodes the maltose-binding protein fused to the intein-CBD tag, was used as a control. pTYB1GnT51 was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). For the D102A substitution, the sense and antisense primers were 5′-TATCTTCAAATTGCTAGCCATATGAGATTTGTAAAAG and 5′-ATCTCATATG GCTAGCAATTTGAAGATAATATTTTTC, respectively, yielding pTYB1GnT51(D102A). Nucleotide substitutions are in bold, and new diagnostic restrictions sites are underlined. The H104D substitution was created using 5′-TCAAATTGATAGTGA CATGAGATTTGTAAAAGATTGG and 5′-ATCTTTTACAAATCTCATGTCACTATCAATTTGAAGA as sense and antisense primers, respectively, yielding pTYB1GnT51(H104D). Note that the sense and antisense primers were staggered slightly because perfectly overlapping primers, created as suggested by the kit, were unsuccessful. pTYB1GnT51(K23R) was created by using a variant of PF10 that contained an A629G substitution (numbered as in Fig. 4). To create a fusion protein with the CBD-intein at the N terminus of GnT51 (22Chong S. Montello G.E. Zhang A. Cantor E.J. Liao W. Xu M.-Q. Benner J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5109-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the full-length coding region of pTYB1GnT51 was amplified using the following primers: PF11, 5′-ATCCAGCTCTTCCAACATGAATGAAAATTCTATTTTTGTTTCTATTATAAGTTATAG, and PR12, 5′-TTCGCATCGCCTGCAGTTAAATACCGATTTGGGATTTAATTACATACTCCAT. The PCR product was cloned as above, excised with SapI andPstI (underlined), and ligated directly into the corresponding sites of pTYB11 to create pTYB11GnT51(L276S), which encoded a mutant CBD-intein-GnT51 fusion protein. This plasmid contained a PCR-derived t1388c mutation resulting in a L276S amino acid substitution. Plasmids to encode C-terminal-truncated GnT51 were created using PF11 and either of the antisense primers PR13, 5′-ATTACGCGACCTGCAGTTATTGATTAAATAAAATTAATAACCTTTTTTTTGAA, or PR14, 5′-ATTCGAGGCTCTGCAGTTACAAGGTTATATTTAAGTTCTATTTTAATTCCATCATC. These inserts were cloned into pTYB11 as above to create pTYB11GnT51(1–282) and pTYB11GnT51(1–369+), respectively. pTYB11GnT51(1–369+) contained a nonsense C-terminal extension (VTAGRGSGC) before the stop codon. Plasmids were transfected into E. coli strain ER2566 using a CaCl2 co-precipitate and grown in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C on a shaker. When cells achieved anA 600 of 0.5–0.8, expression was induced by incubation in 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 15 h at 10 °C on a gyrator at 200 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellets were frozen at −80 °C. Cells were lysed by resuspending in 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmHEPES-NaOH (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmtris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 0.1% Tween 20, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and probe-sonicated on ice until the cell suspension became viscous. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant and pellet were referred to as the S12 and P12 fractions. To purify expressed protein, each S12 fraction was applied to a 0.6-ml column of chitin equilibrated in wash buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.8), 0.01% Tween 20, and protease inhibitors (see above)) and washed in the same buffer until theA 280 fell to below 3% of its initial value. Elution was accomplished by introducing DTT to the column to stimulate autocleavage of the CBD-intein moiety from the GnT51 polypeptide. The column was incubated for 22 h in 50 mm DTT in the wash buffer and eluted with 5 mm DTT in wash buffer. This step was repeated for a second incubation of 36 h, which was then eluted with 50 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20 in wash buffer. All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Additional elutions were carried out 22 °C or at pH 9.0. Fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE on a 7–20% linear gradient gel followed by staining with Coomassie Blue or Western blotting using anti-CBD from New England Biolabs.M r standards (SDS-6H) were from Sigma. The Skp1 GlcNAc-Tase was assayed using either highly purified Skp1 or peptide acceptor substrates (13Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. West C.M. J. Biol.

The reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.8), 0.01% (v/v) Tween 80, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and donor and acceptor substrates. UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was present at 1 μm, about 4-fold above its K m value for GnT51. Skp1A1-myc is a modified form of Skp1 expressed recombinantly with a C-terminal Myc epitope tag. Skp1A1-myc has 2 amino acid substitutions (I34T,D71G) that render it inefficiently modified by GlcNAc in vivo. Purified Skp1A1-myc has only about 15% of the normal level of sugar based on composition analyses, and mass spectrometric analysis suggests approximately equal parts of peptides containing Pro-143 that are hydroxylated or not hydroxylated (10Teng-umnuay P.

Skp1A1-myc was present at ∼2.5 μm, above its apparentK m of 0.6 μm (13Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. West C.M. J. Biol.

Peptide 133–155 (containing Hyp-143) was present at 0.67–1 mm, which is below its apparent K m of 1.6 mm (13Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. West C.M. J. Biol.

Reactions containing S12 extracts were supplemented with 1 mm NaF and 1 mm ATP, and those containing purified recombinant GnT51 were supplemented with 2 mm ATP. Reactions were incubated at 22–30 °C for 15–240 min and verified to be linear with respect to time (data not shown). Results presented in the same panel were obtained under the same conditions and are representative of at least two independent trials on different enzyme preparations. Incorporation was assayed by either trichloroacetic acid precipitation or SDS-PAGE followed by scintillation counting of gel slices (13Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36392-36402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as indicated. GnT51 was purified to near homogeneity and applied to an SDS-PAGE gel that was stained with Coomassie Blue (13Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. West C.M. J. Biol.

The released peptides were extracted, cleaned by microcartridge C18 purification, and introduced into a Q-TOF tandem mass spectrometer (23Morris H.R. Paxton T. Dell A. Langhorne J. Berg M. Bordoli R.

A doubly charged ion detected in the mass spectrum at m/z 510 was passed for collisional-activated decomposition (CAD) MS/MS. The resulting product ion spectrum (Fig. 1 A) could be interpreted via a series of b and y′′ ions (Fig. 1 B) to give a high confidence sequence for peptide 3 (TableI). A further doubly charged ion atm/z 976 was passed for CAD MS/MS, yielding the product ion mass spectrum shown in Fig.2 A, which was interpreted as deriving from the sequence given in Fig. 2 B, designated peptide 1 in Table I. Altogether, this approach yielded five peptide sequences (see Table I) that were candidates for the design of degenerate primers to be used in a PCR approach to amplify GnT51-coding DNA.Table IGnT51 peptide sequences determined by mass spectrometryPeptide no.Sequence obtainedPeptide ionm/z1(L/I)(L/I)(L/I)VASGFGENDGF(L/I)R9762+2(Q/K)PNDDNNMV(L/I)DEK7662+3FGGYYEER5102+4(L/I)PN(L/I)(L/I)PTHR5302+5YY(L/I)(L/I)(Q/K)(L/I)DSHMR6632+Sequences derived from the Q-TOF MS/MS spectra of doubly charged ions, as described in Figs. 1 and 2, and regarded as good candidates for the design of degenerate primers.

The underlined regions were assigned as high confidence regions of sequence interpretation. The peptide sequences were initially used to screen a conceptually translated (tBLASTn) data base containing DNA sequences obtained from randomly fragmentedDictyostelium DNA. The sequence of a 137-nt fragment was found to encode peptide 3 and also the partially characterized neighboring peptide 6 in the same frame (labeled in Fig. 4). The nucleotide sequence of this fragment was used to design PCR primers in both forward and reverse orientations to be used in association with degenerate primers from peptides 1 and 2, also designed in both orientations, to amplify GnT51 DNA from genomic DNA. Degenerate primers PF1 (5′-MAACCAAAYGATGATAAYAAYATGG) and PF2 (5′-TCWGGTTTYGGTGAAAAYGATGGTTT), when combined with reverse-oriented primers from the 137-nt fragment (PR1, 5′-ATAATCATCTAAACTTTTAATTTTACC, and PR2, 5′-CTCCATAATGGGATTCATAAAAAATGT), yielded discrete products with lengths of ∼770 and 750 nt, respectively, as depicted in Fig.3 A. Interestingly, these PCR products were amplified despite significant sequence differences between primer and genomic DNA template sequences. These differences arose in one case from an inability of the MS analysis to resolve between an Asn residue and a Gly-Gly pair in peptide 2 (which have the same mass), albeit this residue was assigned as beyond the high confidence region of the interpretation in Table I, and in the other case from a probable error in the one-pass sequencing of the original 137-bp fragment from the Dictyostelium sequencing project. The success of the approach despite these problems, which are inherent in the methodologies involved here, attests to the robustness of the touchdown PCR strategy employed (20Roux K.H. Dieffencach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer, A Laboratory Primer. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 53-62Google Scholar). Adjacent sequences were obtained by linker-mediated PCR using primers shown in Figs. 3 A and 4, with partial confirmation coming from additional sequences deposited later in the International Dictyostelium DNA Sequencing Consortium database. PCR-4 spanned upstream from GnT51 coding DNA across 443 nt of A/T-rich (84%) putative intergenic DNA into a new ORF oriented in the opposite direction. PCR-5 spanned downstream of GnT51 coding DNA across 567 nt of A/T-rich (88%) intergenic DNA into a new ORF. A large, central ORF consisting of 1220 nt encoded all five peptides from the MS sequencing (Table I) but lacked a suitable 5′-start codon. Its A/T content of 78% was within the normal range ofDictyostelium coding DNA (19Glockner G. Eichinger L. Szafranski K. Pachebat J.A. Bankier A.T. Dear P.H. Lehmann R. Baumgart C. Parra G. Abril J.F. Guigo R. Kumpf K. Tunggal B. Cox E. Quail M.A. Platzer M. Rosenthal A. Noegel A.A. Nature. 2002; 418: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, a second, short 49-nt ORF (78% A/T content) was identified upstream of the main ORF, separated by 118 nt of DNA with an A/T content of 93%. This intervening DNA was terminated by a consensus intron motif (GT … AG) that fell between the first and second positions of the codon predicted to join the two candidate exons. These characteristics are typical of Dictyostelium introns (19Glockner G. Eichinger L. Szafranski K. Pachebat J.A. Bankier A.T. Dear P.H. Lehmann R. Baumgart C. Parra G. Abril J.F. Guigo R. Kumpf K. Tunggal B. Cox E. Quail M.A. Platzer M. Rosenthal A. Noegel A.A. Nature. 2002; 418: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The initial Met residue of the candidate exon-1 lies in a context typical ofDictyostelium start codons (24Vervoort E.B. van Ravestein A. van Piej N.N.M.E. Heikoop J.C. van Haastert P.J. Verheijden G.F. Linskens M.H.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2069-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and is preceded by multiple in-frame stop codons. The 2-exon model yielded a predicted coding region of 423 amino acids with an M r of 49,114, similar to the apparent M r of GnT51 of 51,000, based on SDS-PAGE (13Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36392-36402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 28% of the amino acid sequence could be verified by comparison with the original MS/MS analysis, which had been optimized to identify and sequence peptides for PCR primers (Fig.4). The first 280 amino acids of the predicted GnT51 sequence show distant similarity to the catalytic domain of family GT27 animal mucin-type PP α-GalNAc-Tases (25Hagen F.K. Hazes B. Raffo R. deSa D. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6797-6803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Two regions of greatest similarity are shown in Fig. 5 A. The first is similar to the previously identified NRD-2 (nucleotide recognition domain-2) seen in family GT2 and GT27 GTases (26Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 961-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and includes a highly conserved DXH tripeptide motif (denoted with #) corresponding to the metal binding DXD motif seen in many GTase families. The second region corresponds to but extends in both directions beyond the so-called Gal/GalNAc motif shared between β4-GalTases, PP α-GalNAc-Tases, and other GTase families (25Hagen F.K. Hazes B. Raffo R. deSa D. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6797-6803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Together these regions are predicted to comprise the catalytic domain of GnT51 (Fig. 3 C). This similarity is consistent with their related functions, the addition of a HexNAc residue to a protein hydroxyamino acid. An even greater simi"
https://openalex.org/W2073723844,"We present evidence that the signal recognition particle (SRP) recognizes signal sequences via the NG domain on the SRP54 protein subunit. Using a recently developed cross-linking method (Fancy, D. A., and Kodadek, T. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 6020-6024; Correction (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 1317), we find that signal peptides cross-link to the Escherichia coli SRP protein Ffh (the homologue of the mammalian SRP54 subunit) via the NG domain. Within the NG domain, the cross-linking site maps to the ras-like C-terminal subdomain termed the G domain. This result stands in contrast to previous studies, which concluded based on nascent chain cross-linking that the signal sequence bound to the adjacent M domain. As independent evidence of a direct binding interaction between the NG domain and the signal sequence, we find that the NG domain of Ffh binds signal peptides as an isolated entity. Our results suggest that the NG domain forms a substantial part of the binding site for the signal sequence."

Reverse transcriptase PCR evaluation of PKC isoform expression at the level of mRNA revealed the presence of α and ε/ε′ in all glioma cell lines analyzed; most, but not all cell lines expressed δ and ζ. No messages were found for the βI and βII isotypes of PKC in the tumor cells. Normal astrocytes expressed β but not γ. The essential features of these results were confirmed at the protein level by Western analysis. This disproportionate pattern of PKC isoform expression in glioma cell lines was further echoed in the functional effects of these PKC isoforms on BNaC2 activity in bilayers. PKC holoenzyme or the combination of PKCβI and PKCβII isoforms inhibited BNaC2. Neither PKCε nor PKCζ or their combination had any effect on BNaC2 activity in bilayers.

Despite significant characterization of ASICs, the possible role of second messenger regulation of ASICs has not been reported. Moreover, Bubien et al. (34Bubien J.K. Keeton D.A. Fuller C.M.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C1405-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported an amiloride-sensitive Na+ current in malignant brain tumor cells and the presence of BNaC2 message in these cells. Also, human glioma cells show a differential expression of specific PKC 1The abbreviations used for: PKC, protein kinase C; RT, reverse transcriptase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GBM, glioblastoma multiform. isoforms compared with normal astroglia (35Xiao H. Goldthwait D.A. Mapstone T. J. Neurosurg. 1994; 81: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we explored the role of PKC and its isoforms in the regulation of BNaC2. We found 1) expression of PKCα, PKCε, PKCδ, and PKCζ in most cell lines and no expression of PKCβ in all glioma cell lines compared with normal astrocytes; 2) separately, PKCβI and PKCβII lacked a channel inhibitory effect, but in combination PKCβI and PKCβII inhibited channel activity in bilayers, which was comparable with the inhibitory effect of whole PKC; 3) PKCε and PKCζ individually and in combination did not inhibit BNaC2, but a 5-fold excess of a PKCε and PKCζ combination abolished the otherwise inhibitory influence of the PKCβI and PKCβII mixture; 4) whole PKC, PKCβI, PKCβII, PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCζ phosphorylated BNaC2 in vitro; 5) PKCβI plus PKCβII inhibited inward Na+ currents in human U87-MG glioma cells. Our findings of disproportionate expression of PKC isotypes in glioma cell lines and their antagonism with respect to influencing BNaC2 activity in bilayers suggest that different proportions of PKC isoforms differentially regulate BNaC2 activity. Also, dysregulation of BNaC2 resulting from an altered expression of the PKC isoforms could be responsible for an activated amiloride-sensitive Na+ current seen in glioma cells (34Bubien J.K. Keeton D.A. Fuller C.M. Gillespie G.Y. Reddy A.T. Mapstone T.B. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1405-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). PKC, PKC isoforms, and PKC inhibitor peptide 19–31 were purchased from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were reagent grade, and all solutions were made with distilled water and filter-sterilized before use (Sterivex-GS, 0.22 μm filter; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Total RNA was isolated from human glioma cells and normal astrocytes using a modification of the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). The integrity of the RNA was verified after electrophoresis through 1% agarose-formaldehyde denaturing gels. One-step RT-PCR was performed to detect PKC isozyme mRNA with a Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit. Total reaction mixture was 50 μl, containing 0.2 μg RNA, 0.4 mm of each dNTP, 30 μm of forward and reverse primer, and appropriate OneStep RT-PCR enzyme mix and buffer. RT-PCR was carried out beginning with a single cycle of 50 °C for 30 min (reverse transcription), 95 °C for 15 min (initial PCR activation step), followed by cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, for a total of 35 cycles. This was followed by a single cycle of 72 °C for 10 min to facilitate final extension.

Open table in a new tab Primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. All primer sequences were searched in GenBankTM, and no similarities between primers and other human gene sequences were found except for the target gene we intended to amplify. To confirm this, we used full-length cDNAs (ATCC) for human PKC isoform α, β, γ, ε, and ζ as substrates in PCR reactions with each of the primer pairs. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The primers we designed for each isoform generated amplicons only from the appropriate PKC isoform cDNA template and not from the other templates. Authenticity of each product was confirmed by size and digestion with three restriction enzymes, as well as by direct sequencing. Computer analysis of nucleotide and restriction enzyme mapping was done using the Genetics Computer Group Package (37Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) on a Unix computer and were provided through the University of Alabama at Birmingham Center for AIDS Research. Human lymphocyte RNA preps (volunteer donors) were used as positive controls (data not shown; see Ref. 13Reeh P.W. Kress M. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The protocol used for Western analyses for different PKC isoforms in glial tumor cell lines was identical to that described earlier (38Jovov B. Tousson A. Ji H.L. Keeton D. Shlyonsky V. Ripoll P.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37845-37854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). In vitro phosphorylation by PKC and its isoforms was assayed by measuring the incorporation of [32P] into immunopurified protein (BNaC2) from [γ-32P]ATP, in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 15–50 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 microunit of PKC or its isoforms. Immunopurification of in vitro translated protein was performed as described previously (38Jovov B. Tousson A. Ji H.L. Keeton D. Shlyonsky V. Ripoll P.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37845-37854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The incubation was carried out for 3 min at 30 °C, and the phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Where indicated, PKC activity was measured in the presence of 0.5 mmCaCl2 or 1 μm PKC inhibitor (peptide 19–31). Standard methods for oocyte isolation, cRNA preparation, and injection were used (39Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1450-C1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oocyte membrane vesicles were prepared as described (39Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1450-C1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Perez G. Lagrutta A. Adelman J.P. Toro L. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Oocyte membrane vesicles were fused with planar lipid bilayers made of a 2:1 (w/w) diphytanoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine/diphytanoyl-phosphatidylserine solution in n-octane (final lipid concentration 25 mg/ml). Bilayers were bathed with symmetrical 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS-Tris, 100 μm EGTA, 50 nm[Ca2+]free, pH 7.4. The Bound-and-Determined computer program was used to calculate the level of free [Ca2+] (41Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation mixture contained 10 ng/ml of PKC or its isoforms, 5 μm diacylglycerol, 100 μm Mg-ATP. To verify the orientation of BNaC2 and its block by amiloride, at the end of each experiment 5 μmamiloride was added to the presumptive extracellular side of the channel. Single channel currents were measured using a conventional current-to-voltage converter with a 10 gigaohm feedback resistor (Eltec, Daytona Beach, FL) as described previously (42Ismailov I.I. Shlyonsky V.G. Alvarez O. Benos D.J. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Single channel analyses were performed using pCLAMP 5.6 software (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) on current records low pass-filtered at 300 Hz through an 8-pole Bessel filter (902 LPF; Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) prior to acquisition using a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed on cultured human U87-MG glioma cells as described previously (34Bubien J.K. Keeton D.A. Fuller C.M. Gillespie G.Y. Reddy A.T. Mapstone T.B. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1405-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKC isoforms were included in the pipette solution at a final concentration of 5 ng/ml. RT-PCR using specific primer pairs for PKCα, PKCβ, PKCδ, PKCε, PKCγ, and PKCζ (Table I) was performed on total RNA isolated from SK-MG1 glioma cells (Fig.1 A, top). A similar analysis was carried out for primary cultures of human astrocytes, three first passage cultures of glioblastoma multiform (GBM) tumor resections (PT1, PT2, and PT3) and ten established cell lines, nine of which were originally derived from GBMs and one (D32GS) from a gliosarcoma (Fig. 1 A). These experiments revealed that PKCβ mRNA was expressed by normal astrocytes but not by any of the tumor cells. The astrocytes expressed all of the PKC isoforms examined, except for PKCγ. Only PKCα and PKCε/ε′ were detected in all of the gliomas. Likewise, PKCδ mRNA was expressed in all samples except D32GS. There was more variability in expression of PKCγ and PKCζ. These results demonstrated that PKCα, PKCε/ε′, and PKCδ were expressed reliably in all of the GBM glioma cell lines examined and that PKCβI and PKCβII were not expressed at all (the primer pairs used for the detection of PKCβ spanned the common region of PKCβI and PKCβII). Western blot analysis was also performed to examine protein expression of PKCβI, PKCε/ε′, and PKCζ in the astrocytes and SK-MG1 and U87-MG cells (Fig. 1 B). Similar to the results presented in Fig. 1 A, only astrocytes expressed PKCβI, all three cell types expressed PKCε/ε′, and the astrocytes and SK-MG1, but not U87-MG, expressed PKCζ. BNaC2 incorporated into planar lipid bilayers forms a functional amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel with a very low probability of being in an open state (PO ∼0.08) (43Berdiev B.K. Mapstone T.B. Markert J.M. Gillespie G.Y. Lockhart J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38755-38761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, buffering [Ca2+]free in the bilayer bathing solution to <100 nm significantly increases PO and thus provides the opportunity to investigate the effects of PKC and its isoforms on a wild-type active channel. Addition of the phosphorylation mixture (with holoenzyme PKC) to the bilayer bathing solution decreased BNaC2 PO from 0.89 ± 0.09 to 0.45 ± 0.06 without any effect on single channel conductance (Fig. 2 A). We next tested the hypothesis that specific PKC isoforms could affect BNaC2 activity in different ways. The rationale for this set of experiments was the following. First, PKC is a large family of related proteins with at least 11 isotypes, each with a distinctive primary structure, expression pattern, and subcellular localization (44Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Second, several groups (35Xiao H. Goldthwait D.A. Mapstone T. J. Neurosurg. 1994; 81: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 45Sharif T.R. Sharif M. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 237-243PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that PKCε/ε′ and PKCζ are overexpressed in many glial tumor cell lines, whereas PKCβ is reduced or even absent compared with normal human astrocytes (Fig.1 A). Third, amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents were observed in primary cultures of freshly resected tumors and established glioma cell lines (34Bubien J.K. Keeton D.A. Fuller C.M. Gillespie G.Y. Reddy A.T. Mapstone T.B. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1405-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) along with BNaC mRNA. We began by examining PKCβI and PKCβII effects on BNaC2 activity in bilayers. When added alone, neither PKCβI nor PKCβII had any effect on BNaC2 activity (Table II), but their combination significantly decreased BNaC2 PO from 0.91 ± 0.08 to 0.48 ± 0.06; no changes in single conductance were observed (Fig. 2 B). This inhibition of BNaC2 activity by the PKCβI and PKCβII combination was equivalent to that of whole PKC. These results support the hypothesis that PKCβI and PKCβII are essential, at least in planar lipid bilayers, for the inhibitory effect of PKC on BNaC2 activity. Because of the reported up-regulated levels of PKCε and PKCζ isotypes, and the expectation that these isoforms could have their own effects on BNaC2 activity, we explored the effect of PKCε and PKCζ on BNaC2 activity. We found that PKCε and PKCζ added alone or in combination, did not have any effect on BNaC2 activity (Table II). This outcome prompted us to imitate the differential levels of PKC isoform expression in gliomas in our bilayer experiments. A 5-fold excess of PKCε and PKCζ relative to PKCβI and PKCβII was added to the bilayer bathing solution following incorporation of BNaC2. This maneuver abolished the otherwise inhibitory effect of the PKCβI and PKCβII combination on BNaC2 activity in bilayers (Fig. 2 C). We did not observe this effect with a 1:1 ratio of isoforms (Table II). Also, a 5-fold excess of PKCδ or its combination with PKCε or PKCζ neither affected BNaC2 activity nor interfered with the inhibitory influence of the PKCβI and PKCβII combination on BNaC2 activity (Table II).Table IIThe effect of phosphorylation by PKC and its isoforms on properties of BNaC2 in planar lipid bilayersPKC or PKC isoform(s)Before phosphorylationAfter phosphorylationGPoGPopSpSPKC21 ± 2.00.89 ± 0.0921 ± 2.30.45 ± 0.06PKCβI19 ± 2.10.88 ± 0.0622 ± 1.80.92 ± 0.06PKCβII20 ± 1.90.91 ± 0.0619 ± 1.80.87 ± 0.08PKCβI + PKCβII23 ± 2.00.91 ± 0.0820 ± 2.10.48 ± 0.06PKCβI + PKCβII*21 ± 2.20.61 ± 0.0722 ± 1.80.24 ± 0.05PKCβI + PKCβII**19 ± 2.50.37 ± 0.0520 ± 2.10.07 ± 0.04PKCδ21 ± 1.90.90 ± 0.0620 ± 2.00.92 ± 0.06PKCε19 ± 2.80.87 ± 0.0821 ± 2.40.91 ± 0.06PKCζ21 ± 2.60.93 ± 0.0618 ± 2.70.93 ± 0.06PKCε + PKCζ19 ± 2.90.89 ± 0.0621 ± 1.60.88 ± 0.09PKCε + PKCζ:PKCβI + PKCβII (1:1)22 ± 1.80.92 ± 0.0720 ± 1.40.46 ± 0.07PKCε + PKCζ:PKCβI + PKCβII (5:1)19 ± 3.10.89 ± 0.0621 ± 2.20.92 ± 0.08PKCδ + PKCε:PKCβI + PKCβII (5:1)20 ± 1.60.91 ± 0.0719 ± 2.00.48 ± 0.06PKCδ + PKCζ:PKCβI + PKCβII (5:1)21 ± 1.40.88 ± 0.0721 ± 1.80.45 ± 0.07G, single channel conductance; Po, the open probability of the channel; *, in the presence of 0.983 μm[Ca2+]free; **, in the presence of 2.24 μm [Ca2+]free.

At higher Ca2+ concentrations (0.983 and 2.24 μm), PKCβI and PKCβII also inhibited BNaC2 channel activity, and this inhibition was in addition to the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ itself on the channel. Because of the functional effects of PKC and its isoforms on BNaC2 activity in planar bilayers, we hypothesized that BNaC2 should be a substrate for phosphorylation by this kinase and its isoforms. As illustrated in Fig.3 A, BNaC2 can indeed be specifically phosphorylated by PKC (lanes 1 and2). Elimination of BNaC2 or inclusion of a PKC peptide inhibitor to the reaction mixture prevented phosphorylation of BNaC2 (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Similarly, PKC isoforms (βI, βII, δ, ε, and ζ) phosphorylated BNaC2 (Fig.3 B). Elimination of BNaC2 protein from the reaction mixture prevented BNaC2 phosphorylation (data not shown). Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed on cultured human U87-MG glioma cells to test the hypothesis that PKCβI + PKCβII can inhibit the constitutively activated inward Na+ currents seen in these cells. As a prelude, Fig.4 presents representative whole-cell patch clamp records from a U87-MG cell before and after treatment with amiloride. Amiloride effectively blocked inward currents. Fig.5 represents the patch clamp results of the PKC experiments. Inclusion of 5 ng/ml PKCβII in the pipette solution had no effect on the inward currents (middle panel). In contrast, PKCβI + PKCβII abolished the inward currents (right panel). As an additional control, PKCζ also was without effect (data not shown), consistent with the bilayer findings (Table II).Figure 5Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from representative U87-MG cells.

To understand its import the mt translocation of wild type and mutant Mtf1p constructs was investigatedin vitro under various assay conditions. We report here that Mtf1p, unlike most mt matrix proteins hitherto studied, is translocated into the mitochondria independent of membrane potential, ATP hydrolysis, and membrane receptor. This unusual import of Mtf1p was also observed on ice (3 °C). Sub-mitochondrial fractionation demonstrated that Mtf1p was translocated in vitro to one or more of the same mt sites as the endogenous protein that includes the matrix. To identify the mt-targeting sequence of Mtf1p, various N-terminal, C-terminal, or internally deleted Mtf1p derivatives were generated. The full-length and C-terminal deletions but not the N-terminal truncated Mtf1p were imported into mitochondria, indicating the importance of its N-terminal sequence for mt targeting. However, the internal deletion of Mtf1p revealed that the first 150-amino acid N-terminal sequence alone was not sufficient for mt targeting of Mtf1p, suggesting that an extended rather than a short N-terminal sequence is required for import. We favor a model in which Mtf1p adopts an import-competent conformation during translation. Consistent with this model are three findings: most of the protein sequence appears to be required for optimal import, urea denaturation eliminates its import competence, and the import-competent form of the protein is more resistant to tryptic hydrolysis than is the denatured protein.

The rest of the mt proteins (i.e. ∼97%) are encoded by the nuclear genome, translated in the cytoplasm, and then imported into different compartments of mitochondria using protein-specific import mechanisms (6Schatz G.

Because the vast majority of mt proteins are the products of nuclear genes, mt protein import represents a fundamental subject of investigation in the cellular protein trafficking and the biogenesis of the organelle.In recent years a great deal of experimental effort has unveiled some distinct features of the mt protein import pathway. Most of the nuclear-encoded mt proteins so far studied are synthesized with an N-terminal presequence that is positively charged with a notable absence of negatively charged residues and has the potential to form an amphipathic α-helix (6Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Google Scholar, 7Neupert W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Google Scholar, 10von Heijne G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 604-608Google Scholar). The mt matrix proteins are imported into mitochondria by a general import pathway composed of cytoplasmic chaperones, two hetero-oligomeric membrane complexes (a TOM complex in the outer membrane and a TIM complex in the inner membrane), and the mt chaperones. In the cytosol the translocation competent conformation of the precursor is maintained by one or more cytoplasmic ATP-dependent chaperone proteins (6Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Google Scholar, 7Neupert W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Google Scholar, 8Pfanner N. Craig E.A. Honlinger A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 25-51Google Scholar). The N-terminal presequence of the precursor interacts with a receptor on the cytosolic surface of the mt outer membrane (11Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 339-349Google Scholar, 12Eilers M. Hwang S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1139-1145Google Scholar, 13Pfanner N. Rassow J. Guiard B. Sollner T. Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16324-16329Google Scholar). This interaction then catalyzes the inward movement of preprotein through the membrane-integrated TOM/TIM channel complexes at the contact sites of the mt outer and inner membranes. Protein import across both mt membranes into the matrix is facilitated by dynamic interaction between the TOM and TIM complexes (14Pfanner N. Meijer M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 100-103Google Scholar), which provide an aqueous channel in the hydrophobic lipid bilayer for protein transport (15Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Google Scholar). Further translocation of preprotein into the mt matrix requires a membrane potential across the inner membrane, ATP hydrolysis, and mt chaperones (6Schatz G. Dobberstein B.

In the final event of the import process the N-terminal presequence of the imported protein is often proteolytically removed by the mt processing peptidase to generate a mature protein (16Brunner M.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22671-22677Google Scholar) are necessary for mt gene-specific transcription. Both subunits of the mt RNA polymerase are nuclear gene products and imported into the mt matrix after synthesis in the cytosol. Interestingly, the initiating methionine is the only amino acid missing from the mature Mtf1p purified from the isolated mitochondria (25Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22671-22677Google Scholar) suggesting that mt import of Mtf1p occurs without cleavage of a targeting sequence. To understand the import mechanism of Mtf1p, we have extended our earlier observation (26Sanyal A. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11970-11976Google Scholar) by studying Mtf1p import in the simultaneous absence of mt membrane potential, ATP, and physiological temperature, of much more comprehensive deletion mutagenesis, including internal deletions, following urea denaturation and its capacity to drive the import of a fusion protein containing a mouse cytoplasmic protein (i.e. DHFR). Mt fractionation demonstrated that the in vitro synthesized protein is translocated to the same sub-mitochondrial site as the endogenous protein. Together with the earlier observation (26Sanyal A. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11970-11976Google Scholar) Mtf1p import appears to be robust requiring little direct investment of energy or other commonly used import factors. We suggest that the energy-requiring step is in the formation during synthesis of an import-competent conformation of Mtf1p. The Mtf1p import mechanism appears to represent a unique example of mt protein trafficking and translocation.DISCUSSIONWe have reported here the conditions under which Mtf1p is imported and localized within isolated yeast mitochondria. Taken together from the results presented here and those from our earlier experiments, it appears that the translocation of Mtf1p into the mt matrix is carried out without a cleavable N-terminal presequence, a proteinaceous surface receptor, an mt membrane potential or ATP hydrolysis. This unusual import of Mtf1p is also observed when import is performed on ice (i.e. 3 °C). To our knowledge, this is the only known case of protein import into the mt matrix that does not involve any of the previously described requisites of the classic import pathway. Mtf1p is also capable of carrying a heterologous protein into the mitochondria by the same pathway. The sub-mitochondrial fractions demonstrated that the in vitro imported protein is translocated to the same sites as the endogenous protein. This suggests that Mtf1p under the in vitro conditions probably follows an import pathway similar to that for the endogenous protein of living cells. This is consistent with observations of intact yeast of various mt petite genotypes. The mt accumulation of Mtf1p is unimpaired in yeasts that have functionally deficient mitochondria (petites) or that lack mt DNA (ρ0). This is not the case for an mt matrix protein (mt r-protein Mna6p) that appears to follow the canonical pathway into the mitochondria. Although Mtf1p is regarded as a matrix protein, we find a significant portion of the protein associated with the mt inner membrane. We do not know the physiological significance of this distribution.We favor an import model for Mtf1p that relies on a favorable import-competent conformation for several reasons. First, compared with other mt proteins hitherto studied, Mtf1p carries quite an extended targeting sequence. Indeed almost all of the protein sequence seems to be required for optimal import. Second, in contrast to F1β (and other proteins using the canonical pathway), Mtf1p import is dramatically reduced by urea denaturation. The unfolding induced by urea denaturation is thought, if anything, to facilitate the import of conventionally imported proteins (12Eilers M. Hwang S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1139-1145Google Scholar, 34Law R.H.P. Nagley P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1027: 141-148Google Scholar, 35Ostermann J. Horwich L.A. Neupert W. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1989; 341: 125-130Google Scholar). Urea-induced Mtf1p unfolding appears to disrupt the postulated import-competent conformation. The folding of Mtf1p into this conformation probably takes place during translation in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, where ATP is available. The apparent energy independence of Mtf1p import could relate to the notion that the energy is expended during the synthesis and folding of the protein into an energy-dependent import-competent conformation. This could be facilitated by the charge segregation in the linear sequence of the protein, a segregation that could facilitate charge-charge interaction in the folding of the protein. The productive folding of this protein probably relies on the chaperones present in the reticulocyte lysate. We have evidence that the import of protein synthesized in the wheat germ extract depends upon different sequence domains, perhaps because of the differences in the chaperones of the wheat germ extract. 2T. K. Biswas and G. S. Getz, manuscript in preparation. Third, the newly translated and import-competent Mtf1p is more resistant to tryptic hydrolysis than is the urea-denatured protein. This argues that the two forms of the protein differ conformationally.There are several other mt proteins that enter the mitochondria independent of one or more features that characterize the usual protein import pathway, but none of them is as fully independent of the features upon which mt import depends, as is the case for Mtf1p. Among these proteins, the translocation of subunit Va of cytochromec oxidase into the mt inner membrane exhibits features that are apparently related to those implied for Mtf1p. Like Mtf1p, the mt import of subunit Va does not require a surface receptor and is insensitive to the temperature of import, and it requires a very low level of ATP (41Miller B.R. Cumsky M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 833-841Google Scholar), although it is dependent on the mt membrane potential. The mt inner membrane protein ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) does not have a cleavable presequence and is translocated into the mt inner membrane independent of ATP hydrolysis and mt-Hsp60 but requires a membrane potential across the inner membrane (42Adrian G.S. McGammon M.T. Montgomery D.L. Douglas M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 626-634Google Scholar). The mt import of murine CLK-1 protein is guided by its leader sequence but does not need the membrane potential (43Jiang N. Levavasseur F. McCright B. Shoubridge E.A. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29218-29225Google Scholar). A receptor or/and temperature-independent cellular protein translocation pathway has also been noticed with other non-mt proteins. The human HIV TAT protein or a recombinant chimera carrying the 11-residue (YGRKKRRQRRR) highly positively charged transduction domain of TAT protein, moves into the cell in an energy-independent fashion and without any receptor or transporter involvement (44Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Google Scholar). The Drosophila antennapedia homeoprotein is also internalized into cells in the absence of a specific receptor and even at a low temperature (i.e. 10 °C) (45Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Google Scholar). Interestingly, yeast mt Mtf1p, HIV TAT, and Drosophilahomeoprotein are all transcription factors.The other thoroughly studied exception to the classic mt import pathway is apocytochrome c, which is a 108-amino acid soluble protein of the mt inter membrane space. Apocytochrome cimport shares some import features with Mtf1p, although apocytochromec, unlike Mtf1p, does not cross the inner mt membrane. This apoprotein is synthesized without a cleavable N-terminal presequence, but the initiating methionine is missing from the mature form. The mt translocation of apocytochrome c does not require a receptor, ATP hydrolysis, or an electrochemical potential across the inner membrane of mitochondria (30Lill R. Stuart R.A. Drygas M.E. Narang F.E. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 449-456Google Scholar). Mt targeting of apocytochromec is mediated through two functionally independent structural domains located at the N and C termini of the protein, respectively (31Nye S.H. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5763-5771Google Scholar). Apocytochrome c probably makes initial contacts with the outer membrane surface via an electrostatic association with the phospholipid headgroups (30Lill R. Stuart R.A. Drygas M.E. Narang F.E. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 449-456Google Scholar, 31Nye S.H. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5763-5771Google Scholar). This membrane association allows further interaction of this apoprotein with a protease-resistant inter membrane component(s). The apoprotein is then translocated across the outer membrane by diffusion, a reaction that appears to be reversible. Once in the inter membrane space, apocytochrome c interacts with cytochrome c heme lyase (CCHL) on the outer face of the inner membrane, which traps apocytochrome c in the inter membrane space of mitochondria (30Lill R. Stuart R.A. Drygas M.E. Narang F.E. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 449-456Google Scholar, 31Nye S.H. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5763-5771Google Scholar). In the final step apocytochrome c is fixed in the inter membrane space by covalent attachment of heme, a reaction catalyzed by CCHL.What is the structure of Mtf1p that allows for its robust import? The amino acid sequence analysis of several dozens of the cleavable leader peptides of mt precursor proteins of yeast, Neurospora, and mammals reveals that these presequences usually contain several basic and hydroxylated residues but no acidic amino acids (7Neupert W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Google Scholar). These targeting sequences are also predicted to form an amphipathic positively charged α-helix in the membrane-like environments (46von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Google Scholar,47Lemire B.D. Fankhauser C. Baker A. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20206-20215Google Scholar), which seems to be required for preprotein recognition by the mt surface receptors (6Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Google Scholar, 7Neupert W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Google Scholar, 8Pfanner N. Craig E.A. Honlinger A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 25-51Google Scholar, 9Bauer M.F. Neupert W. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2001; 24: 166-180Google Scholar, 10von Heijne G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 604-608Google Scholar) as well as for preprotein transport across the inner membrane (47Lemire B.D. Fankhauser C. Baker A. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20206-20215Google Scholar, 48Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21700-21708Google Scholar). A surplus of positively charged residues in the presequence also greatly facilitates preprotein transport across the inner membrane (i.e. transfer of a precursor protein from the TOM complex to the TIM complex is facilitated by stepwise interactions of the positively charged presequence with the negative charged regions on these two complexes) (47Lemire B.D. Fankhauser C. Baker A. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20206-20215Google Scholar, 48Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21700-21708Google Scholar). In contrast, Mtf1p carries neither a cleavable presequence (25Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22671-22677Google Scholar) nor does its N-terminal sequence exhibit the usual presequence characteristics (i.e.the first 50-amino acid sequence of Mtf1p is not rich in basic and hydroxylated residues and has little capacity to form a positively charged amphipathic α-helix). This suggests that Mtf1p probably carries a nonconventional mt-targeting signal. To ascertain whether an internal region having some of the characteristics of the targeting sequence may exist, we inspected the sequence of Mtf1p for charge segregation. Between residues 100 to 260 in the middle of the protein there is a 44-amino acid region that contains 10 acidic and 2 basic amino acids, followed by a region between residues 157 and 197 that contains 10 basic but no acidic residues, and a third region between residues 207 and 260 that contains 14 acidic and 3 basic residues. Thus, it appears that an internal positively charged region of Mtf1p is surrounded by more negatively charged flanking sequences (Fig.6 A). We have also noticed a small patch of negatively charged sequence at the very end of Mtf1p. Because the charged amino acid residues are important for sub-cellular translocation of mt precursor proteins (6Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Google Scholar, 7Neupert W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Google Scholar, 8Pfanner N. Craig E.A. Honlinger A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 25-51Google Scholar, 9Bauer M.F. Neupert W. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2001; 24: 166-180Google Scholar, 10von Heijne G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 604-608Google Scholar) as well as the human HIV TAT protein (44Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Google Scholar) we have explored by deletion analysis what role these charged or other noncharged regions may play in Mtf1p translocation. The deletion of N-terminal sequences of various lengths and of several internal sequences revealed that the first 50-amino acid N-terminal sequence of Mtf1p is essential but not sufficient for its mt targeting, because the internal sequences from residues 50–144 are also required. This strongly suggests that an extended sequence from 2 to 144 at least is absolutely required for Mtf1p import. Mtf1p import is also influenced by other sequences between 144 and 341 residues. It is not clear whether this is representative of several separated subdomains in this region of the protein that are required for its translocation.Like Mtf1p, mt protein import without a canonical cleavable presequence has also been noticed with other mt proteins (e.g. AAC (42Adrian G.S. McGammon M.T. Montgomery D.L. Douglas M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 626-634Google Scholar), apocytochrome c (31Nye S.H. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5763-5771Google Scholar), Tom22 (49Rodriguez-Cousino N. Nargang F.E. Baardman R. Neupert W. Lill R. Court D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11527-11532Google Scholar), Bcl-2 (50Nguyen M.

On the contrary, the signal sequence of some mt proteins is encoded by an N-terminal segment that is not removed on import (e.g. 70-kDa mt outer membrane protein (53Hurt E.C. Muller U. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3509-3518Google Scholar), inter membrane space protein adenylate kinase (54Bandlow W. Strobel G. Schricker R. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 359-367Google Scholar), mt matrix proteins 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (55Arakawa H. Takiguchi M. Amaya Y. Nagata S. Hayashi H. Mori M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1361-1366Google Scholar) and GTP-AMP phosphotransferase (56Schricker R. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 363-371Google Scholar)). Yet another class of mt or chloroplast proteins carries a cleavable presequence that is not necessary for organelle targeting (e.g. subunit 6 of yeast mt cytochrome bc 1 complex (57DeLabre M.L. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 201-205Google Scholar), mammalian mt phosphate carrier (58Zara V. Palmieri F. Mahlke K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12077-12081Google Scholar), or outer envelope receptor protein Toc86p of chloroplast (59Muckel E. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 266: 23846-23852Google Scholar)).The recent protein data base from the yeast genome sequencing project reveals that almost one-third of nuclear-coded mt proteins indeed lack cleavable N-terminal presequences. According to the size of cleavable presequences yeast mt proteins can be categorized into three different classes. Class 1 consists of major mt proteins with a sizable presequence, which is often cleaved following import. This class includes the mt core RNA polymerase. Class II proteins do not have a cleavable presequence; however, their initiating methionine residue is missing from the mature form. Mtf1p belongs to this class. Proteins belonging to class III remain intact even after their import into mitochondria (i.e. the N-terminal sequences of the preprotein and mature protein are identical) (i.e. Tom6p, r-protein MrpL24, Met-tRNA synthetase). The reported mt-targeting signals range from nonhelical to random secondary structure or mostly polar sequences (46von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Google Scholar, 60Roise D. Theiler F. Horvath S. Tomich J.M. Richards J.B. Allison D.S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 649-653Google Scholar, 61Isenman L. Liebow C. Rothman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 341-370Google Scholar, 62Pfanner N. Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 331-353Google Scholar). This finding suggests that all mt proteins are not imported in precisely the fashion characterized for the bulk of the proteins hitherto studied. There are at least three different import routes that seem to operate for mt targeting of different nuclear-encoded mt proteins (63Kurz M. Martin H. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2461-2474Google Scholar). Preproteins carrying N-terminal signals use the outer membrane Tom20p and the general import pore (GIP) complexes. Preproteins with internal signals such as inner membrane carriers use the outer membrane Tom70p, the GIP complex, and a special Tim pathway, involving small Tims of the inter membrane space and Tim22p-Tim54p of the inner membrane (63Kurz M. Martin H. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2461-2474Google Scholar). The third one is a quite short import pathway for the small Tim proteins themselves. For the translocation of these Tim proteins into the inter membrane space, the trypsin-accessible surface domains of mt import receptors, including Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70, are dispensable (64Dietmeier K. Honlinger A. Bomer U. Dekker P.J.T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Kubrich M. Pfanner N. Nature. 1997; 388: 195-200Google Scholar). However, the trypsin-resistant Tom5 that generally functions as a linker between the receptor and the general import pore (GIP) (64Dietmeier K. Honlinger A. Bomer U. Dekker P.J.T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Kubrich M. Pfanner N. Nature. 1997; 388: 195-200Google Scholar) plays a crucial role for direct translocation of Tims into the inter membrane space. So, Tom5, which typically functions at the second or third stage of the import cascade, could become the first level import component for small Tims and may thus function like an outer membrane receptor for this special translocation process.Although we cannot at present outline the pathway and mechanism for Mtf1p translocation, Mtf1p import at low temperature and in the absence of general import factors argues for a unique translocation mechanism. As explained above we favor a mechanism that derives from the generation of an import competent conformation of Mtf1p in the translation lysate. The proposed Mtf1p conformation, unlike the N-terminal leader sequence of most precursor proteins, may not recognize the conventional mt membrane receptor(s). However, Mtf1p may interact wit"

Here we report the identification of a novel splice variant, SAF-2, of the SAF family bearing strong sequence similarity to SAF-1. The N-terminal 426 amino acids of both SAF-1 and SAF-2 are identical containing two polyalanine tracts, one proline-rich domain, and six zinc fingers. However, the C terminus of SAF-2 containing two additional zinc fingers is different from SAF-1, which indicates the capability of different biochemical function. We show that SAF-2 interacts more avidly with the SAF-binding element, but its transactivation potential is much lower than SAF-1. Furthermore, co-expression of SAF-2 markedly suppresses SAF-1-regulated promoter function. Finally, we show that the level of SAF-2 protein is reduced during many inflammatory conditions, whereas the SAF-1 protein level remains unchanged. Together, these data suggest that the relative abundance of SAF-2 plays a critical role in the fine tuned regulation of inflammation-responsive genes that are controlled by SAF-1.

All of these observations suggest that the SAF-1/MAZ/Pur-1 transcription factor is involved in controlling expression of genes associated with diverse cellular processes. Its activation in different tissues in response to diverse physiological conditions apparently determines its ability to regulate expression of different genes.Critical unanswered questions are how transcriptional properties of SAF-1 are regulated. In general, activities of many transcription factors are regulated either by controlling expression of the genes coding these factors at the transcriptional level or by modification of the proteins at post-translational level, most often by phosphorylation (15Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 16Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). Some transcription factors are regulated via interaction of another protein that has a regulatory role, such as that seen in the case of NF-κB/IκB association (17Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing is another important mechanism for regulating activity of a transcription factor in which the same gene can be used to generate splice variants with different functional activities (reviewed in 18–20). Wilms tumor gene product, a Cys2-His2 zinc finger containing transcription factor (21Hewitt S.M. Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8588-8592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), cAMP-responsive element-binding protein modulator (22Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), and signal transducer and activator of transcription, STAT3 (23Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), represent a few examples of many known transcription factors that contain multiple splice variants with distinct functional properties.Here we describe alternative splicing of SAF transcripts that yields a novel splice variant, designated as SAF-2, with an additional exon that is normally embedded within a large intron. Insertion of this exon in SAF-2 mRNA results in the formation of SAF-2 protein containing a C-terminal region that is different from SAF-1. Compared with SAF-1, SAF-2 protein has higher DNA binding but reduced transactivation ability. Furthermore, overexpression of SAF-2 suppresses SAF-1-regulated promoter function. Interestingly, during inflammation, the level of SAF-2 protein is considerably reduced, whereas the SAF-1 protein level remains unchanged. These unique properties of SAF-2 strongly support the notion that SAF-2 plays a critical role in fine-tuning the regulation of all SAF-1-controlled genes.DISCUSSIONThis study provides first evidence of the existence of an alternatively spliced member, SAF-2, of the SAF family of transcription factors. We show that the splicing pattern of SAF-2 varies during inflammation, and SAF-2 protein negatively regulates another member, designated as SAF-1, of the family. These data shed new light on the mechanistic details of SAF-regulated genes.The SAF-1 transcription factor, containing six Cys2His2-type zinc fingers, regulates a variety of genes, and some of them, such as SAA and γ-fibrinogen, are induced during inflammation. Here we show that the gene coding for SAF-1 generates another functionally distinct isoform, SAF-2, by utilizing the alternate splicing mechanism. Due to alternate splicing of the pre-mRNA, a small exon containing 223 nucleotides is inserted at the C-terminal end of SAF-2 mRNA. Consequently, SAF-1 and SAF-2 proteins are identical at the N-terminal end up to 426 amino acids. Due to the insertion of 223 nucleotides in the mRNA, SAF-2 protein gained two additional zinc fingers, but this event also generated a premature termination codon resulting in deletion of 51 amino acids at the C-terminal end of SAF-2 protein. These differences in the structures suggested that SAF-1 and SAF-2 might have similar but distinct functions. Indeed, we show that SAF-2 with two additional zinc fingers exhibits much higher levels of DNA binding ability than SAF-1 (Fig. 7). However, increased DNA binding ability did not get translated to higher transactivating ability, instead SAF-2 displayed lower transactivation potential. We speculate that one of the reasons may be deletion of 51 amino acids at the C-terminal end that includes a 17-amino acid-long polyalanine tract that is present in SAF-1 (Fig. 1). The polyalanine tract and adjacent sequences were shown to function at low concentration as a transcriptional activator inDrosophila cells (32Sauer F. Jackle H. Nature. 1991; 353: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Many genes are known to produce alternatively spliced mRNAs, each encoding a different protein to provide economic and efficient regulation of gene expression. It is estimated that more than one-third of human genes are alternatively spliced (33Hanke J. Brett D. Zastrow I. Aydin A. Delbruck S. Lehmann G. Luft F. Reich J. Bork P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 389-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This versatile regulatory mechanism of gene expression is utilized during development (34McKeown M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), apoptosis (35Jiang Z.H. Zhang W.J. Rao Y. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9155-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), sex determination (20Lopez A.Z. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and hormonal regulation (36Kosaki A. Nelson J. Webstar N.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10331-10337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) of genes. It is noteworthy that inflammation-regulated splicing of SAF pre-mRNA will be, to our knowledge, the first report of this type. Changes in the relative abundance of SAF-2 in response to different inflammatory conditions were demonstrated by both RNA and protein analysis (Fig. 6). At present, the physiologic or pathophysiologic role of SAF-2 is not fully known, but the shift in relative abundance of SAF-2 mRNA and protein during inflammation is highly suggestive of its biological importance. SAF-1, the major isoform of this family, exhibits low but sustained transcriptional activity under normal conditions. The activity of SAF-1 is highly induced in response to inflammatory agents via phosphorylation by a variety of protein kinases including protein kinase C (5Ray A. Fields A.P. Ray B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39727-39733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), MAP kinase (30Ray A. Yu G.Y. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1027-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and protein kinase A (37Ray A. Chen J. Ray B.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2343-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We speculate that under normal conditions, SAF-1 is additionally regulated by the SAF-2 isoform, which has higher DNA binding ability but very poor transactivation property. By competing for the same promoter elements, under normal conditions, SAF-2 further regulates expression of SAF-1-regulated genes. The presence of SAF-2 at a low level in almost all tissues that have been examined (Fig. 5) supports this hypothesis. During inflammation, when the activity of SAF-1 needs to be at its maximum to support inflammation-induced gene expression, SAF-2-driven regulation is lifted by reducing SAF-2 mRNA-specific splicing. Thus the two splice variants could be involved in maintaining a balance for the regulatory function provided by SAF family of proteins. Similar to our observations, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein modulator and STAT3β, splice variants of cAMP-response element-binding protein and STAT3, act as dominant negative regulators of cAMP-response element-binding protein and STAT3 actions (22Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 23Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar).The precise removal of introns from pre-mRNAs is highly complex and requires accurate recognition and pairing of the correct 5′ and 3′ splice sites. Because sequence similarity is always not sufficient to guarantee correct selection of the proper 5′ splice sites, splice site recognition is regulated by additional elements termed as exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) elements (38Wang Z. Hoffman M.H. Grabowski P.J. RNA (New York). 1995; 1: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar). Although the majority of ESEs has been reported to be purine-rich, examples of non-purine-rich sequences are recently becoming known. ESEs are interacted with various splicing factors, such as SR proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, and some other novel alternative splicing factors (reviewed in Ref. 39Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). These factors participate in both constitutive and alternate splicing of pre-mRNAs. Furthermore, identification of polypyrimidine track binding proteins that can repress (40Cote J. Dupuis S. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8535-8543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or positively regulate (41Lou H. Helfman D. Gagel R.F. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) selection of an exon complicates the whole matter. The presence of SAF-2 mRNA at a much lower level than SAF-1 suggests that this splice site is recognized less favorably. One explanation could be the absence of purine-rich elements in SAF-2-specific exon V′. Instead, a CA-rich motif is present at this region. SR proteins that interact with purine-rich sequences are primarily involved in constitutive splicing, whereas the CA-rich element is shown to interact by alternative splicing factors (42Coulter L.R. Landree M.A. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2143-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that during inflammation, alternative splicing reaction that generates SAF-2 mRNA was reduced even further. We speculate that down-regulation of the splicing factor involved in the selection of exon V′ is probably one of the reasons of low SAF-2 mRNA level during inflammation. Although there are at present no reports of conditionally regulated splice factors, splicing factors that are developmentally regulated and play an important regulatory role in cell-specific alternative splicing during normal development and disease are already known (43Ladd A.N. Charlet-B N. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 44Shepard J. Reick M. Olson S. Gravely B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Further studies are necessary for the identification and characterization of the exonic splicing enhancers and the trans-acting factors to gain insight into the inflammation-induced splicing mechanism that controls SAF-1 and SAF-2 mRNA synthesis.

All of these observations suggest that the SAF-1/MAZ/Pur-1 transcription factor is involved in controlling expression of genes associated with diverse cellular processes. Its activation in different tissues in response to diverse physiological conditions apparently determines its ability to regulate expression of different genes. Critical unanswered questions are how transcriptional properties of SAF-1 are regulated. In general, activities of many transcription factors are regulated either by controlling expression of the genes coding these factors at the transcriptional level or by modification of the proteins at post-translational level, most often by phosphorylation (15Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 16Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). Some transcription factors are regulated via interaction of another protein that has a regulatory role, such as that seen in the case of NF-κB/IκB association (17Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing is another important mechanism for regulating activity of a transcription factor in which the same gene can be used to generate splice variants with different functional activities (reviewed in 18–20). Wilms tumor gene product, a Cys2-His2 zinc finger containing transcription factor (21Hewitt S.M. Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Saunders G.F. J. Biol.

Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), and signal transducer and activator of transcription, STAT3 (23Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), represent a few examples of many known transcription factors that contain multiple splice variants with distinct functional properties. Here we describe alternative splicing of SAF transcripts that yields a novel splice variant, designated as SAF-2, with an additional exon that is normally embedded within a large intron. Insertion of this exon in SAF-2 mRNA results in the formation of SAF-2 protein containing a C-terminal region that is different from SAF-1. Compared with SAF-1, SAF-2 protein has higher DNA binding but reduced transactivation ability. Furthermore, overexpression of SAF-2 suppresses SAF-1-regulated promoter function. Interestingly, during inflammation, the level of SAF-2 protein is considerably reduced, whereas the SAF-1 protein level remains unchanged. These unique properties of SAF-2 strongly support the notion that SAF-2 plays a critical role in fine-tuning the regulation of all SAF-1-controlled genes. DISCUSSIONThis study provides first evidence of the existence of an alternatively spliced member, SAF-2, of the SAF family of transcription factors. We show that the splicing pattern of SAF-2 varies during inflammation, and SAF-2 protein negatively regulates another member, designated as SAF-1, of the family. These data shed new light on the mechanistic details of SAF-regulated genes.The SAF-1 transcription factor, containing six Cys2His2-type zinc fingers, regulates a variety of genes, and some of them, such as SAA and γ-fibrinogen, are induced during inflammation. Here we show that the gene coding for SAF-1 generates another functionally distinct isoform, SAF-2, by utilizing the alternate splicing mechanism. Due to alternate splicing of the pre-mRNA, a small exon containing 223 nucleotides is inserted at the C-terminal end of SAF-2 mRNA. Consequently, SAF-1 and SAF-2 proteins are identical at the N-terminal end up to 426 amino acids. Due to the insertion of 223 nucleotides in the mRNA, SAF-2 protein gained two additional zinc fingers, but this event also generated a premature termination codon resulting in deletion of 51 amino acids at the C-terminal end of SAF-2 protein. These differences in the structures suggested that SAF-1 and SAF-2 might have similar but distinct functions. Indeed, we show that SAF-2 with two additional zinc fingers exhibits much higher levels of DNA binding ability than SAF-1 (Fig. 7). However, increased DNA binding ability did not get translated to higher transactivating ability, instead SAF-2 displayed lower transactivation potential. We speculate that one of the reasons may be deletion of 51 amino acids at the C-terminal end that includes a 17-amino acid-long polyalanine tract that is present in SAF-1 (Fig. 1). The polyalanine tract and adjacent sequences were shown to function at low concentration as a transcriptional activator inDrosophila cells (32Sauer F. Jackle H. Nature. 1991; 353: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Many genes are known to produce alternatively spliced mRNAs, each encoding a different protein to provide economic and efficient regulation of gene expression. It is estimated that more than one-third of human genes are alternatively spliced (33Hanke J. Brett D. Zastrow I. Aydin A. Delbruck S. Lehmann G. Luft F. Reich J. Bork P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 389-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This versatile regulatory mechanism of gene expression is utilized during development (34McKeown M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), apoptosis (35Jiang Z.H. Zhang W.J. Rao Y. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9155-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), sex determination (20Lopez A.Z. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and hormonal regulation (36Kosaki A. Nelson J. Webstar N.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10331-10337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) of genes. It is noteworthy that inflammation-regulated splicing of SAF pre-mRNA will be, to our knowledge, the first report of this type. Changes in the relative abundance of SAF-2 in response to different inflammatory conditions were demonstrated by both RNA and protein analysis (Fig. 6). At present, the physiologic or pathophysiologic role of SAF-2 is not fully known, but the shift in relative abundance of SAF-2 mRNA and protein during inflammation is highly suggestive of its biological importance. SAF-1, the major isoform of this family, exhibits low but sustained transcriptional activity under normal conditions. The activity of SAF-1 is highly induced in response to inflammatory agents via phosphorylation by a variety of protein kinases including protein kinase C (5Ray A. Fields A.P. Ray B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39727-39733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), MAP kinase (30Ray A. Yu G.Y. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1027-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and protein kinase A (37Ray A. Chen J. Ray B.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2343-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We speculate that under normal conditions, SAF-1 is additionally regulated by the SAF-2 isoform, which has higher DNA binding ability but very poor transactivation property. By competing for the same promoter elements, under normal conditions, SAF-2 further regulates expression of SAF-1-regulated genes. The presence of SAF-2 at a low level in almost all tissues that have been examined (Fig. 5) supports this hypothesis. During inflammation, when the activity of SAF-1 needs to be at its maximum to support inflammation-induced gene expression, SAF-2-driven regulation is lifted by reducing SAF-2 mRNA-specific splicing. Thus the two splice variants could be involved in maintaining a balance for the regulatory function provided by SAF family of proteins. Similar to our observations, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein modulator and STAT3β, splice variants of cAMP-response element-binding protein and STAT3, act as dominant negative regulators of cAMP-response element-binding protein and STAT3 actions (22Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 23Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar).The precise removal of introns from pre-mRNAs is highly complex and requires accurate recognition and pairing of the correct 5′ and 3′ splice sites. Because sequence similarity is always not sufficient to guarantee correct selection of the proper 5′ splice sites, splice site recognition is regulated by additional elements termed as exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) elements (38Wang Z. Hoffman M.H. Grabowski P.J. RNA (New York). 1995; 1: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar). Although the majority of ESEs has been reported to be purine-rich, examples of non-purine-rich sequences are recently becoming known. ESEs are interacted with various splicing factors, such as SR proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, and some other novel alternative splicing factors (reviewed in Ref. 39Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). These factors participate in both constitutive and alternate splicing of pre-mRNAs. Furthermore, identification of polypyrimidine track binding proteins that can repress (40Cote J. Dupuis S. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8535-8543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or positively regulate (41Lou H. Helfman D. Gagel R.F. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) selection of an exon complicates the whole matter. The presence of SAF-2 mRNA at a much lower level than SAF-1 suggests that this splice site is recognized less favorably. One explanation could be the absence of purine-rich elements in SAF-2-specific exon V′. Instead, a CA-rich motif is present at this region. SR proteins that interact with purine-rich sequences are primarily involved in constitutive splicing, whereas the CA-rich element is shown to interact by alternative splicing factors (42Coulter L.R. Landree M.A. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2143-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that during inflammation, alternative splicing reaction that generates SAF-2 mRNA was reduced even further. We speculate that down-regulation of the splicing factor involved in the selection of exon V′ is probably one of the reasons of low SAF-2 mRNA level during inflammation. Although there are at present no reports of conditionally regulated splice factors, splicing factors that are developmentally regulated and play an important regulatory role in cell-specific alternative splicing during normal development and disease are already known (43Ladd A.N. Charlet-B N. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 44Shepard J. Reick M. Olson S. Gravely B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Further studies are necessary for the identification and characterization of the exonic splicing enhancers and the trans-acting factors to gain insight into the inflammation-induced splicing mechanism that controls SAF-1 and SAF-2 mRNA synthesis. This study provides first evidence of the existence of an alternatively spliced member, SAF-2, of the SAF family of transcription factors.

https://openalex.org/W1987174173,"Although carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases (CPSs) share sequence identity, multidomain structure, and reaction mechanism, they have varying physiological roles and allosteric effectors. Escherichia coli CPS (eCPS) provides CP for both arginine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis and is allosterically regulated by metabolites from both pathways, with inhibition by UMP and activation by IMP and ornithine. The arginine-specific CPS fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (sCPS), however, apparently responds to no allosteric effectors. We have designed and analyzed a chimeric CPS (chCPS, in which the C-terminal 136 residues of eCPS were replaced by the corresponding residues of sCPS) to define the structural basis for the allosteric nonresponsiveness of sCPS and thereby provide insight into the mechanism for allosteric selectivity and responsiveness in the other CPSs. Surprisingly, ornithine and UMP each had a significant effect on chCPS activity, and did so at concentrations that were similar to those effective for eCPS. We further found that sCPS bound both UMP and IMP and that chCPS bound IMP, although none of these interactions led to changes in enzymatic activity. These findings strongly suggest that the nonresponsive sCPS is not able to communicate occupancy of the allosteric site to the active site but does contain a latent allosteric interaction domain.

CP formation is catalyzed by carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CPS) and the labile metabolite is subsequently utilized in two distinct biosynthetic pathways, one producing pyrimidine nucleotides and the other producing arginine and/or urea (1Meister A. Powers S.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1978; 16: 289-315Google Scholar). Feedback inhibition and feed forward activation serve as major control features for almost all CPSs (2Anderson P.M. Walsh P.J. Wright P. Nitrogen Metabolism and Excretion. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 33-49Google Scholar). Elucidating the structural basis for this allosteric regulation and for its varying specificity to fit the different physiological roles of CPSs is critical for understanding the overall structure/function relationship for CPSs and for potentially altering their activity in pathological conditions. Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria have a single enzyme that provides CP for both arginine and pyrimidine biosynthesis.E. coli CPS (eCPS) is allosterically regulated by metabolites from both pathways. Pyrimidine nucleotides, with UMP the most effective, serve as feedback inhibitors for eCPS (3Anderson P.M. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3164-3169Google Scholar, 4Anderson P.M. Marvin S.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 928-934Google Scholar). Because coordinated synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides is necessary for nucleic acid synthesis, purine nucleotides, with IMP the most effective, serve as allosteric activators for eCPS (3Anderson P.M. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3164-3169Google Scholar, 4Anderson P.M. Marvin S.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 928-934Google Scholar). Ornithine, the co-substrate with CP for the subsequent arginine pathway enzyme ornithine transcarbamoylase, is also an allosteric activator for eCPS (4Anderson P.M. Marvin S.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Despite extensive screening, however, there have been no allosteric regulators identified so far, and it is clear that sCPS does not respond to any of the known regulators for other CPSs (6Paulus H. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1983; 22: 177-200Google Scholar, 7Pierard A. Schroter B. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 106: 145-151Google Scholar, 8Price C.W. Holwell J.H. Abdelal A.T.H. J. Gen.

To define the structural basis for this allosteric nonresponsiveness and thereby provide insight into the mechanism for allosteric selectivity and responsiveness in the other CPSs, we have, in the present work, designed and analyzed a chimeric CPS (chCPS) in which the C-terminal 136 residues of eCPS were replaced by the corresponding segment of sCPS. We have found that the chimera retains partial allosteric response, indicating that while the nonresponsive sCPS contains a latent allosteric interaction domain, it is not able to communicate occupancy of the allosteric site to the active site.

Kantrowitz (Boston College; Ref. 14Xu W. Pitts M.A. Middleton S.A. Kelleher K.S. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5507-5515Google Scholar). The expression vector pESP-1 (Stratagene) contains the Schizosaccharomyces pombe nmt1 promoter, the LEU2 selection marker, and encodes a domain of glutathione S-transferase for use as a purification tag. The E. coli strain XL1-Blue was used for transformation and propagation of plasmid DNA. E. coli strain L673, which lacks both CPS subunits and is defective in the Lon protease, was generously provided by Carol Lusty. The CPA2-disrupted S. cerevisiae strain LPL26 and S. pombe strain SP-Q01 were used, respectively, for functional analyses and expression of sCPS. E. coli strains L673 and XL1-Blue were grown in Luria-Bertani or Terrific broth, as described by Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Under selective conditions, L673 cells were grown in minimal medium 132 (16Glansdorff N. Genetics. 1965; 51: 167-179Google Scholar). EK1104 cells were grown in minimal medium as described (14Xu W. Pitts M.A. Middleton S.A. Kelleher K.S. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5507-5515Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strain LPL26 was grown in YPD medium (17Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). S. pombe strain SP-Q01 containing the expression plasmid pESP-1 was grown in rich medium (YES) or minimal medium (EMM) supplemented with 5 mm thiamine to repress the nmt1 promoter or in EMM in the absence of thiamine to induce expression. Bacterial transformations and recombinant DNA techniques were carried out as described in Sambrooket al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-directed mutants were generated using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) or by the recombinant PCR method (18Higuchi R. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.T. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Each mutagenesis cassette was sequenced to verify that no undesired changes were incorporated into the nucleotide sequence. To create pES (the expression plasmid for chCPS), a 523-bp fragment encoding domain D of sCPS was amplified by PCR (pRS315/CPA2as template, primer P1 2Primers (with mutated residues in bold): P1, 5′-AAGTACCAACTAGTTCCATGTACC-3′; P2, 5′-GGCCGCTCTAAAGCTTGTGGATCC-3′; P3, 5′-GGGCAGCAACTAGTCCATGAAG-3′; P4, 5′-CTTCATGGACTAGTTGCTGCCC-3′; P5, 5′-GCAGCTGGGCAGCAACAACTTCCATGTACCACTACC-3′; P6, 5′-GGTAGTGGTACATGGAAGTTGTTGCTGCCCAGCTGC-3′.introduced a SpeI site at nucleotide 3654 and P2 introduced a HindIII site and removed the existing SpeI site at nucleotide 3154) and digested with HindIII andSpeI to give a 506-bp fragment. A unique SpeI restriction site was introduced into pUCABI at the junction between the eCPS C and D domains (nucleotide 5438, primers P3 and P4). Digestion of the modified pUCABI with HindIII and SpeI removed the 1468-bp fragment coding for domain D of eCPS and ornithine transcarbamoylase (also present in the original expression vector) and allowed ligation of the 506-bp CPA2 fragment. Mutagenic primers P5 and P6 eliminated the SpeI site from the final construction and yielded pES. eCPS and chCPS were expressed in E. coli strain L673 as described (19Saeed-Kothe A. Powers-Lee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7231-7238Google Scholar). The purification protocol for eCPS and chCPS was adapted from one developed for recombinant eCPS (20Rubino S.D. Nyunoya H. Lusty C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11320-11327Google Scholar) and was carried out as described (19Saeed-Kothe A. Powers-Lee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7231-7238Google Scholar). sCPS was expressed from the plasmid pRS315 in S. cerevisiae and crude extract was prepared as described (13Lim A.L. Powers-Lee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11400-11409Google Scholar). To enhance the yield of sCPS and to facilitate its purification, sCPS was expressed in S. pombe as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The sCPS coding region was subcloned from pRS315 to the expression vector pESP-1 to yield expression plasmid pESP/sCPS that encodes a 151-kDa protein in which the 27-kDa GST domain is fused to the 124-kDa sCPS. The construct was verified by a combination of restriction mapping, DNA sequencing, and expression analysis. The sCPS fusion protein was expressed in S. pombe and purified by affinity chromatography according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Stratagene). CP synthesis was determined in a two-step assay by coupling the CPS reaction to that of ornithine transcarbamoylase and then quantitating the resulting citrulline (20Rubino S.D. Nyunoya H. Lusty C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11320-11327Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 50 mmHepes, 10 mm ATP, a 5 mm excess of MgSO4 over the total concentration of all nucleotides, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glutamine (or 300 mm NH4Cl), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ornithine, and 0.2 unit of ornithine transcarbamoylase and were initiated by the addition of CPS (pH 7.6, 37 °C, 100 μl final volume). After varying times of incubation, citrulline was determined colorimetrically with diacetylmonoxime, as previously described (21Guthohrlein G. Knappe J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 26: 188-191Google Scholar). To compare CP synthesis in the absence and presence of ornithine, the CPS reaction was coupled to the aspartate transcarbamoylase reaction and the amount of carbamoyl aspartate was determined (14Xu W. Pitts M.A. Middleton S.A. Kelleher K.S. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5507-5515Google Scholar). Aspartate (20 mm) and 0.064 mg of aspartate transcarbamoylase were substituted for ornithine and ornithine transcarbamoylase in the reaction mixtures and the diacetylmonoxime treatment was as described by Prescott and Jones (22Prescott L.M. Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 408-419Google Scholar). ATCase used in this assay was expressed from the pEK81 plasmid inE. coli strain EK1104 and purified as described (14Xu W. Pitts M.A. Middleton S.A. Kelleher K.S. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5507-5515Google Scholar). ATPase activities were determined by using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase coupled assay to follow cleavage of ATP (19Saeed-Kothe A. Powers-Lee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7231-7238Google Scholar). To determine bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity, no ammonia source was added to the assay mixture. To determine ammonium-dependent ATPase activity, 300 mmNH4Cl was included in the reaction mixture and to determine the rate of glutamine-dependent ATPase activity, 10 mm glutamine was included in the mixture. ATP synthesis from ADP and CP was determined by a hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupling system (19Saeed-Kothe A. Powers-Lee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7231-7238Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using the dye binding assay of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard or fromA 280, with 1 mg/ml eCPS yielding anA 280 of 0.685 (20Rubino S.D. Nyunoya H. Lusty C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11320-11327Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 4–15% Tris-HCl criterion SDS-PAGE gels, following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Binding of ornithine, UMP, and IMP to CPSs was determined in a radiometric assay as previously described (20Rubino S.D. Nyunoya H. Lusty C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11320-11327Google Scholar, 26Hewagama A. Guy H.I. Chaparian M. Evans D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 489-499Google Scholar). 100 μg of CPS was allowed to interact for 10 min at 25 °C with 0.1 mm [8-3H]IMP (0.44 Ci/mmol), 0.5 mm l-[2,3-3H]ornithine (18 mCi/mmol), or 0.05 mm [5-3H]UMP (0.8 Ci/mmol) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6 (final volume, 0.1 ml). Enzyme-bound ligand was separated from free ligand on NICKTM columns (Amersham Biosciences, Inc). The column effluent was added to 10 ml of ScintiSafe Plus 50% (Fisher), and counts were recorded in a Beckman model LS6500 scintillation counter. CD spectra were obtained at room temperature on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. The concentrations of eCPS and chCPS were 0.7–1.6 μm for far UV analysis and 7–10 μm for near UV analysis. The proteins were placed in 0.01 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, containing 0.15 m sodium fluoride by centrifugal desalting on Sephadex G-50 (27Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Google Scholar) and the solutions were filtered (0.2-μm low protein binding filters, Gelman Sciences). Spectra were recorded at 100 nm/min in the spectral range from 200 to 250 nm and at 10 nm/min in the spectral range 250 to 325 nm, using 0.1-cm path length cuvettes. The protein spectra were corrected by subtracting the spectrum of the buffer solution before converting the data to molar ellipticities. Kinetic data were collected on a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer and were fit by nonlinear regression (Grafit, version 5.01; Beckman Enzyme Mechanism software) to the equation:v = V maxS/(K m+ S), where v is the initial velocity,V max is the maximal velocity, S is the substrate concentration, and K m is the Michaelis constant. The multiple sequence alignment was produced by the Protein Information Resource (pir.georgetown.edu) and the three-dimensional visualization of the eCPS crystal structure (Swiss Protein Data base accession number 1CE8; Ref. 28Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22502-22507Google Scholar) by Swiss-Model (GlaxoSmithKline). Although CPSs vary in physiological role and mode of regulation, all catalyze the same overall reaction: formation of CP, Pi, and two ADP from HCO 3−, ammonia (free or cleaved from glutamine), and two ATP. Additionally all CPSs appear to share a multidomain structure that is best defined in the solved crystal structure (29Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Google Scholar, 30Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 8-24Google Scholar) of eCPS. Domain A, which exists as a separate ∼40-kDa amidotransferase subunit in both eCPS and sCPS, is responsible for the binding and cleaving of glutamine to yield ammonia (1Meister A. Powers S.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1978; 16: 289-315Google Scholar). The ∼120-kDa eCPS synthetase subunit, which is responsible for binding all other substrates and for catalyzing all other reactions (1Meister A. Powers S.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1978; 16: 289-315Google Scholar), is comprised of four domains. Domains B and C (403 and 382 residues, respectively) are regions of internal duplication (31Nyunoya H. Lusty C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4629-4633Google Scholar) and each domain contains one ATP binding site (29Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Google Scholar, 30Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 8-24Google Scholar). The 149-residue domain D′ is involved in oligomerization (29Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Google Scholar, 30Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M.

A. 1989; 86: 8304-8308Google Scholar). Domain D, the 136-residue C-terminal region of the eCPS synthetase subunit, termed the “allosteric domain” (29Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Google Scholar, 30Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 8-24Google Scholar), is critical for CP synthesis (13Lim A.L. Powers-Lee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11400-11409Google Scholar), and is also involved in oligomerization (29Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Google Scholar, 30Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 8-24Google Scholar). IMP binding has been localized to domain D by photolabeling (33Bueso J. Lusty C.J. Rubio V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1083-1089Google Scholar), site-directed mutagenesis (34Bueso J. Cervera J. Fresquet V. Marina A. Lusty C.J. Rubio V.

UMP binding has also been localized to domain D by photolabeling (40Cervera J. Bendala E. Britton H.G. Bueso J. Nassif Z. Lusty C.J. Rubio V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7247-7255Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis (35Czerwinski R.M. Mareya S.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13920-13927Google Scholar, 36Delannay S. Charlier D.

Biophys. 2002; 400: 34-42Google Scholar). Studies with a number of UMP and IMP analogs, especially dUMP, have suggested that IMP and UMP bind to overlapping sites (41Boettcher B. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13971-13976Google Scholar). Ornithine binding has been localized to the interface of the C/D domains by crystal structure analysis (29Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Google Scholar, 30Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 8-24Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis (35Czerwinski R.M. Mareya S.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13920-13927Google Scholar, 36Delannay S. Charlier D. Tricot C.

Fresquet V. Rubio V. Cervera J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 323-328Google Scholar). Domain D also appears to be the allosteric domain for the other CPSs that have been studied thus far (44McCudden C.R. Powers-Lee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18285-18294Google Scholar, 45Rodriguez-Aparicio L.B. Guadalajara A.M. Rubio V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3070-3074Google Scholar). Domain boundaries for construction of chCPS were based on the solved eCPS crystal structure and on sequence alignment, with domain C of eCPS 39% identical to that of sCPS and domain D of eCPS 26% identical to that of sCPS (46Lusty C.J. Widgren E.E. Broglie K.E. Nyunoya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14466-14477Google Scholar). In the eCPS crystal structure (29Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Google Scholar,30Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 8-24Google Scholar), domain D starts at residue 937 and extends to the C-terminal end of the protein (residue 1073). Sequence alignment indicated that the corresponding region in sCPS extends from residue 959 to the C-terminal end of the protein (residue 1118). Therefore, for the present studies, we created an expression vector pEs to yield chCPS in which the separate eCPS 41-kDa amidotransferase subunit is retained unchanged and in which residues 937–1073 of the eCPS synthetase subunit are replaced by residues 959–1118 of the sCPS synthetase subunit. We also constructed the complementary chimeric CPS in which residues 1–958 were derived from the sCPS synthetase subunit and residues 937–1073 from the eCPS subunit. However, this construction yielded inactive CPS when expressed in S. cerevisiae (using the pRS315 expression vector used for sCPS expression) or in E. coli (using the pUCAB expression vector used for eCPS and chCPS expression). The only other chimeric CPS construction of which we are aware was designed on the basis of limited proteolysis data because the eCPS crystal structure was not yet available and was comprised of the first 901 residues of the eCPS synthetase subunit fused to residues 1273–1461 of the pyrimidine-specific hamster CPS synthetase subunit (47Liu X. Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27747-27755Google Scholar). This construction was active and its analysis showed that domain D of the hamster CPS was sufficient to confer on the chimera the hamster CPS response to allosteric nucleotides. To determine whether the chCPS construction could produce CP, its ability to functionally complement E. colistrain L673 was assessed. L673 is deficient in eCPS and is therefore dependent for growth on the presence of arginine and uracil in the medium or on transformation with a plasmid carrying a functional CPS (13Lim A.L. Powers-Lee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11400-11409Google Scholar). L673 cells expressing either eCPS or chCPS grew at approximately the same rate on solid minimal medium, indicating that chCPS was able to effectively catalyze the synthesis of CP. eCPS and chCPS were expressed in L673 and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purity of the preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). This analysis also revealed the expected subunit composition for the purified proteins, with the same 41-kDa amidotransferase subunit for each protein and with 121- and 118-kDa synthetase subunits for chCPS and eCPS, respectively. Comparison of circular dichroism spectra of eCPS and chCPS revealed no significant differences and the spectra were very similar to that previously reported for eCPS (20Rubino S.D. Nyunoya H. Lusty C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11320-11327Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters of chCPS were assessed by previously reported assays (24Anderson P.M. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3157-3163Google Scholar) that reflect the utilization of only ATPB, only ATPC, or both molecules of ATP (TableI). In the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase reaction, which reflects usage of only ATPB, chCPS displayed behavior very similar to that of eCPS. The chCPS K m for ATPB was about twice that of eCPS and the chCPS V max was about half of the eCPS value. In the ATP synthesis reaction, which reflects usage of only ATPC, similar ATPC K m values were observed for chCPS and eCPS, with the former value 1.5 times greater than the latter. There was a larger distinction in V max for this partial reaction, with chCPS displaying a 5.6-fold reduction. In the glutamine-dependent ATPase reaction, which reflects the coupled utilization of both ATP molecules to form CP, theK m for ATP was very similar for chCPS and eCPS. Also, chCPS displayed a ratio of CP produced to ATP utilized close to the 1:2 value for eCPS. With glutamine as the nitrogen source, chCPS produced 1 μmol of CP for each 2.88 ATP cleaved and, with ammonia as a nitrogen source, chCPS produced 1 μmol of CP for each 2.30 ATP cleaved. However, the chimera V max for the overall reaction was the kinetic parameter most distinct from eCPS parameters, with a 23-fold reduction. Domain D is known to be critical for enzymatic activity (13Lim A.L. Powers-Lee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11400-11409Google Scholar, 35Czerwinski R.M. Mareya S.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13920-13927Google Scholar) and might participate in conformational changes at the active site and/or might function to exclude water from the active site (13Lim A.L. Powers-Lee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11400-11409Google Scholar). Although the overall architecture of eCPS and sCPS appears to be conserved, allowing the construction of an active chimera, the folding of domain D of sCPS cannot be expected to precisely replicate that of the 26% identical eCPS domain D, with alterations presumably decreasing the catalytic effectiveness. Because allosteric effectors bound at domain D primarily affect ATPC and apparently thereby affect the overall activi"
