https://openalex.org/W2119764013,"Intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes are either sorted for cargo degradation into lysosomes or secreted as exosomes into the extracellular milieu. The mechanisms underlying the sorting of membrane into the different populations of intraluminal vesicles are unknown. Here, we find that cargo is segregated into distinct subdomains on the endosomal membrane and that the transfer of exosome-associated domains into the lumen of the endosome did not depend on the function of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery, but required the sphingolipid ceramide. Purified exosomes were enriched in ceramide, and the release of exosomes was reduced after the inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinases. These results establish a pathway in intraendosomal membrane transport and exosome formation."
https://openalex.org/W2092018614,"In stratified epithelial tissues, homeostasis relies on the self-renewing capacity of stem cells located within the innermost basal layer. As basal cells become suprabasal, they lose proliferative potential and embark on a terminal differentiation programme. Here, we show that microRNA-203 is induced in the skin concomitantly with stratification and differentiation. By altering miR-203's spatiotemporal expression in vivo, we show that miR-203 promotes epidermal differentiation by restricting proliferative potential and inducing cell-cycle exit. We identify p63 as one of the conserved targets of miR-203 across vertebrates. Notably, p63 is an essential regulator of stem-cell maintenance in stratified epithelial tissues. We show that miR-203 directly represses the expression of p63: it fails to switch off suprabasally when either Dicer1 or miR-203 is absent and it becomes repressed basally when miR-203 is prematurely expressed. Our findings suggest that miR-203 defines a molecular boundary between proliferative basal progenitors and terminally differentiating suprabasal cells, ensuring proper identity of neighbouring layers."

To identify additional risk variants, we genotyped 1,020 of the most strongly associated non-HLA markers in an additional 1,643 cases and 3,406 controls. Through joint analysis including the genome-wide association study data (767 cases, 1,422 controls), we identified seven previously unknown risk regions (P < 5 x 10(-7)). Six regions harbor genes controlling immune responses, including CCR3, IL12A, IL18RAP, RGS1, SH2B3 (nsSNP rs3184504) and TAGAP. Whole-blood IL18RAP mRNA expression correlated with IL18RAP genotype. Type 1 diabetes and celiac disease share HLA-DQ, IL2-IL21, CCR3 and SH2B3 risk regions. Thus, this extensive genome-wide association follow-up study has identified additional celiac disease risk variants in relevant biological pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1994728257,"Current theories hypothesize that dopamine neuronal firing encodes reward prediction errors. Although studies in nonhuman species provide direct support for this theory, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans have focused on brain areas targeted by dopamine neurons [ventral striatum (VStr)] rather than on brainstem dopaminergic nuclei [ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra]. We used fMRI tailored to directly image the brainstem. When primary rewards were used in an experiment, the VTA blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response reflected a positive reward prediction error, whereas the VStr encoded positive and negative reward prediction errors. When monetary gains and losses were used, VTA BOLD responses reflected positive reward prediction errors modulated by the probability of winning. We detected no significant VTA BOLD response to nonrewarding events."
https://openalex.org/W2037611829,"A major obstacle to creating precisely expressed transgenes lies in the epigenetic effects of the host chromatin that surrounds them. Here we present a strategy to overcome this problem, employing a Gal4-inducible luciferase assay to systematically quantify position effects of host chromatin and the ability of insulators to counteract these effects at phiC31 integration loci randomly distributed throughout the Drosophila genome. We identify loci that can be exploited to deliver precise doses of transgene expression to specific tissues. Moreover, we uncover a previously unrecognized property of the gypsy retrovirus insulator to boost gene expression to levels severalfold greater than at most or possibly all un-insulated loci, in every tissue tested. These findings provide the first opportunity to create a battery of transgenes that can be reliably expressed at high levels in virtually any tissue by integration at a single locus, and conversely, to engineer a controlled phenotypic allelic series by exploiting several loci. The generality of our approach makes it adaptable to other model systems to identify and modify loci for optimal transgene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1992702812,"The specification and maintenance of growth sites are tightly regulated during cell morphogenesis in all organisms. ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 2 reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (RHD2 NADPH) oxidase–derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulate a Ca 2+ influx into the cytoplasm that is required for root hair growth in Arabidopsis thaliana . We found that Ca 2+ , in turn, activated the RHD2 NADPH oxidase to produce ROS at the growing point in the root hair. Together, these components could establish a means of positive feedback regulation that maintains an active growth site in expanding root hair cells. Because the location and stability of growth sites predict the ultimate form of a plant cell, our findings demonstrate how a positive feedback mechanism involving RHD2, ROS, and Ca 2+ can determine cell shape."
https://openalex.org/W2050838528,"The premature-ageing disease Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is caused by constitutive production of progerin, a mutant form of the nuclear architectural protein lamin A1,2. Progerin is also expressed sporadically in wild-type cells and has been linked to physiological ageing3. Cells from HGPS patients exhibit extensive nuclear defects, including abnormal chromatin structure4,5 and increased DNA damage6. At the organismal level, HGPS affects several tissues, particularly those of mesenchymal origin7. How the cellular defects of HGPS cells lead to the organismal defects has been unclear. Here, we provide evidence that progerin interferes with the function of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We find that expression of progerin activates major downstream effectors of the Notch signalling pathway. Induction of progerin in hMSCs changes their molecular identity and differentiation potential. Our results support a model in which accelerated ageing in HGPS patients, and possibly also physiological ageing, is the result of adult stem cell dysfunction and progressive deterioration of tissue functions."
https://openalex.org/W1980730766,"The tubular structure of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) appears to be generated by integral membrane proteins, the reticulons and a protein family consisting of DP1 in mammals and Yop1p in yeast. Here, individual members of these families were found to be sufficient to generate membrane tubules. When we purified yeast Yop1p and incorporated it into proteoliposomes, narrow tubules (approximately 15 to 17 nanometers in diameter) were generated. Tubule formation occurred with different lipids; required essentially only the central portion of the protein, including its two long hydrophobic segments; and was prevented by mutations that affected tubule formation in vivo. Tubules were also formed by reconstituted purified yeast Rtn1p. Tubules made in vitro were narrower than normal ER tubules, due to a higher concentration of tubule-inducing proteins. The shape and oligomerization of the ""morphogenic"" proteins could explain the formation of the tubular ER."

https://openalex.org/W1989272610,"Despite the integral role of ice nucleators (IN) in atmospheric processes leading to precipitation, their sources and distributions have not been well established. We examined IN in snowfall from mid- and high-latitude locations and found that the most active were biological in origin. Of the IN larger than 0.2 micrometer that were active at temperatures warmer than -7�C, 69 to 100% were biological, and a substantial fraction were bacteria. Our results indicate that the biosphere is a source of highly active IN and suggest that these biological particles may affect the precipitation cycle and/or their own precipitation during atmospheric transport."

https://openalex.org/W2051381362,"A defining feature of glial cells has been their inability to generate action potentials. We show here that there are two distinct types of morphologically identical oligodendrocyte precursor glial cells (OPCs) in situ in rat CNS white matter. One type expresses voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, generates action potentials when depolarized and senses its environment by receiving excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input from axons. The other type lacks action potentials and synaptic input. We found that when OPCs suffered glutamate-mediated damage, as occurs in cerebral palsy, stroke and spinal cord injury, the action potential–generating OPCs were preferentially damaged, as they expressed more glutamate receptors, and received increased spontaneous glutamatergic synaptic input in ischemia. These data challenge the idea that only neurons generate action potentials in the CNS and imply that the development of therapies for demyelinating disorders will require defining which OPC type can carry out remyelination."
https://openalex.org/W2020833431,"Staying aloft when hovering and flying slowly is demanding. According to quasi–steady-state aerodynamic theory, slow-flying vertebrates should not be able to generate enough lift to remain aloft. Therefore, unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms to enhance lift production have been proposed. Using digital particle image velocimetry, we showed that a small nectar-feeding bat is able to increase lift by as much as 40% using attached leading-edge vortices (LEVs) during slow forward flight, resulting in a maximum lift coefficient of 4.8. The airflow passing over the LEV reattaches behind the LEV smoothly to the wing, despite the exceptionally large local angles of attack and wing camber. Our results show that the use of unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms in flapping flight is not limited to insects but is also used by larger and heavier animals."

https://openalex.org/W2097718039,"The regulated trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors at synapses is critical for synaptic function and plasticity. However, the molecular machinery that controls active transport of receptors into synapses is largely unknown. We found that, in rat hippocampus, the insertion of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) into spines during synaptic plasticity requires a specific motor protein, which we identified as myosin Va. We found that myosin Va associates with AMPARs through its cargo binding domain. This interaction was enhanced by active, GTP-bound Rab11, which is also transported by the motor protein. Myosin Va mediated the CaMKII-triggered translocation of GluR1 receptors from the dendritic shaft into spines, but it was not required for constitutive GluR2 trafficking. Accordingly, myosin Va was specifically required for long-term potentiation, but not for basal synaptic transmission. In summary, we identified the specific motor protein and organelle acceptor that catalyze the directional transport of AMPARs into spines during activity-dependent synaptic plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2061054080,"Using linewidth and spinning sideband intensities of lipid hydrocarbon chain resonances in proton magic angle spinning NMR spectra, we detected the temperature-dependent phase state of naturally occurring lipids of intact influenza virus without exogenous probes. Increasingly, below 41 degrees C ordered and disordered lipid domains coexisted for the viral envelope and extracts thereof. At 22 degrees C much lipid was in a gel phase, the fraction of which reversibly increased with cholesterol depletion. Diffusion measurements and fluorescence microscopy independently confirmed the existence of gel-phase domains. Thus the existence of ordered regions of lipids in biological membranes is now demonstrated. Above the physiological temperatures of influenza infection, the physical properties of viral envelope lipids, regardless of protein content, were indistinguishable from those of the disordered fraction. Viral fusion appears to be uncorrelated to ordered lipid content. Lipid ordering may contribute to viral stability at lower temperatures, which has recently been found to be critical for airborne transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2092135924,"A distinctive way of quantitatively imaging inertial fusion implosions has resulted in the characterization of two different types of electromagnetic configurations and in the measurement of the temporal evolution of capsule size and areal density. Radiography with a pulsed, monoenergetic, isotropic proton source reveals field structures through deflection of proton trajectories, and areal densities are quantified through the energy lost by protons while traversing the plasma. The two field structures consist of (i) many radial filaments with complex striations and bifurcations, permeating the entire field of view, of magnetic field magnitude 60 tesla and (ii) a coherent, centrally directed electric field of order 10 9 volts per meter, seen in proximity to the capsule surface. Although the mechanism for generating these fields is unclear, their effect on implosion dynamics is potentially consequential."
https://openalex.org/W1982787945,"Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) suppress autoreactive immune responses and limit the efficacy of tumor vaccines; however, it remains a challenge to selectively eliminate or inhibit Treg cells. In this study, the zinc-finger A20, a negative regulator of the Toll-like receptor and tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling pathways, was found to play a crucial part in controlling the maturation, cytokine production and immunostimulatory potency of dendritic cells (DCs). A20-silenced DCs showed spontaneous and enhanced expression of costimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines and had different effects on T cell subsets: they inhibited Treg cells and hyperactivated tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and T helper cells that produced interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α and were refractory to Treg cell–mediated suppression. Hence, this study identifies A20 as an antigen presentation attenuator in control of antitumor immune responses during both the priming and the effector phases and provides a strategy to overcome Treg cell–mediated suppression in an antigen-specific manner, reducing the need to directly target Treg cells."

https://openalex.org/W2145656942,"Bacterial nitric-oxide (NO) synthases (bNOSs) are smaller than their mammalian counterparts. They lack an essential reductase domain that supplies electrons during NO biosynthesis. This and other structural peculiarities have raised doubts about whether bNOSs were capable of producing NO in vivo. Here we demonstrate that bNOS enzymes from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus anthracis do indeed produce NO in living cells and accomplish this task by hijacking available cellular redox partners that are not normally committed to NO production. These ""promiscuous"" bacterial reductases also support NO synthesis by the oxygenase domain of mammalian NOS expressed in Escherichia coli. Our results suggest that bNOS is an early precursor of eukaryotic NOS and that it acquired its dedicated reductase domain later in evolution. This work also suggests that alternatively spliced forms of mammalian NOSs lacking their reductase domains could still be functional in vivo. On a practical side, bNOS-containing probiotic bacteria offer a unique advantage over conventional chemical NO donors in generating continuous, readily controllable physiological levels of NO, suggesting a possibility of utilizing such live NO donors for research and clinical needs."
https://openalex.org/W2033410380,"Recently, we demonstrated that chondroitin polymerization is achieved by any two combinations of human chondroitin synthase-1 (ChSy-1), ChSy-2 (chondroitin sulfate synthase 3, CSS3), and chondroitin-polymerizing factor (ChPF). Although an additional ChSy family member, called chondroitin sulfate glucuronyltransferase (CSGlcA-T), has been identified, its involvement in chondroitin polymerization remains unclear because it possesses only glucuronyltransferase II activity responsible for the elongation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains. Herein, we report that CSGlcA-T exhibits polymerization activity on α-thrombomodulin bearing the truncated linkage region tetrasaccharide through its interaction with ChSy-1, ChSy-2 (CSS3), or ChPF, and the chain length of chondroitin formed by the co-expressed proteins in various combinations is different. In addition, ChSy family members co-expressed in various combinations exhibited distinct but overlapping acceptor substrate specificities toward the two synthetic acceptor substrates, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol and GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NH-benzyloxycarbonyl, both of which share the disaccharide sequence with the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region tetrasaccharide. Moreover, overexpression of CSGlcA-T increased the amount of CS in HeLa cells, whereas the RNA interference of CSGlcA-T resulted in a reduction of the amount of CS in the cells. Furthermore, the analysis using the CSGlcA-T mutant that lacks any glycosyltransferase activity but interacts with other ChSy family members showed that the glycosyltransferase activity of CSGlcA-T plays an important role in chondroitin polymerization. Overall, these results suggest that chondroitin polymerization is achieved by multiple combinations of ChSy-1, ChSy-2, CSGlcA-T, and ChPF and that each combination may play a unique role in the biosynthesis of CS. Based on these results, we renamed CSGlcA-T chondroitin synthase-3 (ChSy-3).

CS is a linear, sulfated polysaccharide composed of repeating disaccharide units consisting of alternating uronic acid (GlcUA) and GalNAc residues and synthesized as a proteoglycan bound to specific Ser residues in the core protein (1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar, 2Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev.

Compelling evidence has shown that CS-proteoglycans play crucial roles in a number of physiological phenomena, such as cell adhesion, morphogenesis, neural network formation, and cell division (5Perrimon N.

Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Therefore, an understanding of CS synthesis and its regulatory mechanism underlying diverse CS functions is essential. The biosynthesis of CS is initiated by the addition of Xyl to specific serine residues in the core protein, followed by the sequential addition of two Gal residues and a GlcUA residue, forming the tetrasaccharide linkage structure GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser. Each transferring reaction is catalyzed by the corresponding glycosyltransferase. Then chondroitin polymerization with alternating GalNAc and GlcUA takes place, forming the repeating disaccharide region. Then a number of sulfotransferases modify the chondroitin backbone with sulfate at specific positions, resulting in the structural diversity of CS (7Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To date, six homologous glycosyltransferases, all of which are probably responsible for CS biosynthesis, have been cloned.

The PCR fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site of pGIR201protA (20Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1394-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the fusion of the insulin signal sequence and the protein A sequence present in the vector, as described previously (8Kitagawa H.

Two separate PCRs were performed to generate two overlapping gene fragments using the soluble form of CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3) cDNA as a template. In the first PCR, the sense 5′-primer described above and the antisense internal mutagenic primer listed below were used: D184A 5′-GCACATATGTGGCATCCTGCATGATG-3′ (the mutated nucleotide is underlined). In the second round of PCR, the sense internal mutagenic primer (complementary to the antisense internal mutagenic primer) and the antisense 3′-primer described above were used. These two PCR products were gel-purified and then used as a template for a third PCR containing the sense 5′-primer and the antisense 3′-primer described above. The final PCR fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site of pGIR201protA (20Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1394-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the amplified cDNA was determined in a 377 DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). Expression of a Soluble Form of CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3) and Enzyme Assays—The expression plasmid (6.0 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For co-transfection experiments, the CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3) and ChSy-1, ChSy-2, or ChPF expression plasmids (3.0 μg each) were co-transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENE 6, as above. Two days after transfection, 1 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with and then resuspended in the assay buffer and tested for GalNAcT and GlcUA transferase activities, as described below. To quantify the protein absorbed onto IgG-Sepharose beads, the bound protein was eluted with 1 m acetic acid and then quantified using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent (enhanced protocol; Pierce). Assays for GalNAcT-II and GlcAT-II were carried out using chondroitin as an acceptor and UDP-GalNAc or UDP-GlcUA as a sugar donor, respectively, as described previously (21Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K.

Polymerization reactions using α-TM, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-NM, or GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NH-Cbz as acceptors were coincubated in reaction mixtures containing the following constituents in a total volume of 20 μl: 1 nmol of α-TM, 100 nmol of GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-NM or 100 nmol of GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NH-Cbz, 0.25 mm UDP-[3H]Gal-NAc (5.28 × 105 dpm), 0.25 mm UDP-GlcUA, 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5 or 5.8, 10 mm MnCl2, and 10 μl of the resuspended beads. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Characterization of the Enzyme Reaction Products—Products of polymerization reactions on α-TM were isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex peptide column with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 as the eluent. The [3H]GalNAc-labeled oligosaccharide chains were released from α-TM by alkaline reduction treatment using 1.0 m NaBH4, 0.05 m NaOH and then exhaustively digested with chondroitinase ABC using 50 mIU of the enzyme for 1 h, as described previously (23Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the enzyme digest was subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex peptide column, as described above. To determine the size of reaction products, the remaining aliquot was subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 as the eluent. Calibration of the Superdex 200 column was performed using a series of commercial polysaccharides of known size. Pull-down Assays—The cDNA fragment of a truncated form of CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3), lacking the first 57 N-terminal amino acids of putative CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3), was amplified using a 5′-primer (5′-CGGAATTCAGAGCTCGGCTAGACCAAAG-3′) containing an in-frame EcoRI site and a 3′-primer (5′-CGGAATTCCCATCTTGCCTTGCCCTTCC-3′) containing an EcoRI site. The cDNA fragment of a truncated form of ChSy-2, lacking the first 129 N-terminal amino acids of ChSy-2, was also amplified using a 5′-primer (5′-GCTCTAGAGGCTGCCGGTCCGGGCAG-3′) containing an in-frame XbaI site and a 3′-primer (5′-GCTCTAGACAATCTTAAAGGAGTCCTATGTA-3′) containing an XbaI site. Each DNA fragment was inserted into a pcDNA3Ins-His expression vector, resulting in the fusion of the protein with the insulin signal sequence and His6 sequence present in the vector. Combinations of these constructs and the protein A-tagged expression vectors were transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, 1 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) overnight at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with TBS buffer containing Tween 20 three times and subjected to SDS-PAGE (7% gel), and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane, after blocking in PBS containing 2% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20, was incubated with IgG antibody and then treated with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins bound to the antibody were visualized with an ECL advance kit (Amersham Biosciences). Subcellular Localization—The cDNA fragment encoding CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3) was amplified using a 5′-primer (5′-CGGAATTCCTGGCAGGGCCTACCACC-3′) containing an EcoRI site and a 3′-primer (5′-CGGAATTCTGCTATTGGCCTGCTCCT-3′) containing an EcoRI site. The cDNA fragment encoding ChSy-1 was amplified using a 5′-primer (5′-CCCTCGAGGGAGCGGCGCGGGCATG-3′) containing an XhoI site and a 3′-primer (5′-CCCTCGAGGGCTGTCCTCACTGAGCCA-3′) containing an in-frame XhoI site. The cDNA fragment encoding ChSy-2 was amplified using a 5′-primer (5′-CCCTCGAGGCGACAGCCCAGCGAGCGTCCG-3′) containing an XhoI site and a 3′-primer (5′-CGGAATTCGAGTTCGATTGTACCTGACACC-3′) containing an in-frame EcoRI site. The cDNA fragment encoding ChPF was amplified using a 5′-primer (5′-CCCTCGAGACTCCTCTGGCTGCTCTGG-3′) containing an XhoI site and a 3′-primer (5′-CGGAATTCTGCTGTTGCCCTGCTCCT-3′) containing an in-frame EcoRI site. PCR was carried out with KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO) for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 42 s, and 68 °C for 180 s in 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. Each PCR fragment was subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 or pDsRed-Monomer-N1 expression vector (Clontech). The Golgi marker vector (pEGFP-Golgi) was constructed using the pECFP-Golgi vector (Clontech) that harbors a sequence encoding the N-terminal 81 amino acids of human β1–4-galactosyltransferase (24Watzele G. Berger E.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This region of human β1–4-galactosyltransferase contains the membrane-anchoring signal peptide that targets the fusion protein to the trans-medial region of the Golgi apparatus (25Llopis J.

J. 1994; 11: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The region from pECFP-Golgi was digested with NheI and BamHI and subcloned into pEGFP-N1. In addition, the ER marker vector (pDsRed2-ER) was obtained from Clontech. Combinations of GFP-tagged and DsRed-Monomer-tagged expression vectors (3.0 μg each) were transfected into HeLa cells on glass bottom dishes (Matsunami Glass) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescent images were obtained using a laser-scanning confocal microscope, FLUOVIEW (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Northern Blot Analysis—A commercial human 12-Lane Multiple Tissue Northern blot (Clontech) membrane was used for the analysis. The membrane was probed with a gel-purified, radiolabeled (>1 × 109 cpm/μg), 871-bp CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3)-specific fragment corresponding to nucleotides 3031–3903 of the CSGlcA-T cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AB095612). Establishment of an Expression Vector for CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3) and Preparation of Cells That Stably Overexpress CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3)—The cDNA fragment encoding CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3) was amplified from KIAA1402 cDNA as a template using a 5′-primer (5′-CGGAATTCCTGGCAGGGCCTACCACC-3′) containing an EcoRI site and a 3′-primer (5′-CGGAATTCCCATCTTGCCTTGCCCTTCC-3′) containing an EcoRI site. PCR was carried out with KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO) for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 42 s, and 68 °C for 180 s in 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The PCR fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pCMV expression vector (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequence of the amplified cDNA was determined in a 377 DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). The expression plasmid (6.7 μg) was transfected into HeLa cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfectants were cultured in the presence of 1,000 μg/ml G418. Then resultant colonies were picked up and propagated for experiments. RNA Interference of the CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3) Gene—A 25-mer double-stranded RNA composed of sense 5′-GGCUUACAGUGAAAUAGAACAACUGAG-3′ and antisense 5′-CAGUUGUUCUAUUUCACUGUAAGCCAU-3′ sequences and of sense 5′-UCGGCUAGACCAAAGUGAUGAAGACAG-3′ and antisense 5′-GUCUUCAUCACUUUGGUCUAGCCGAAU-3′ sequences for CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3) was designed and purchased from iGENE (Tsukuba, Japan). Silencing, scrambled RNA composed of sequences with no homology to known human sequences (iGENE) was used as a control. The HeLa cells were transfected with 10 nm small interfering RNA (siRNA) using TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Takara, Otsu, Japan). Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from HeLa cells using a QuickPrep total RNA extraction kit (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA was synthesized from ∼1 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and an oligo(dT)20-M4 adaptor primer (Takara). Primer sequences used were as follows: CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3), a forward primer 5′-GCTCGGCTAGACCAAAG-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-TGTAGCTCGGGAGGTCA-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a forward primer 5′-ATGGGTGTGAACCATGAGAAGTA-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-GGCAGTGATGGCATGGAC-3′. Quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR was performed using a FastStart DNA Master plus SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science) in a LightCycler ST300 (Roche Applied Science). The expression level of CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3) mRNA was normalized to that of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript. Derivatization of Glycosaminoglycans from HeLa Cells Using a Fluorophore, 2-Aminobenzamide—Cells were homogenized in acetone and air-dried. The dried materials were digested with heat-pretreated (60 °C for 30 min) actinase E in 200 μl of 0.1 m borate-sodium, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm calcium acetate at 60 °C for 24 h. Following incubation, each sample was treated with trichloroacetic acid, and the resultant precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The soluble fraction was extracted with ether. The aqueous phase was neutralized with 1.0 m sodium carbonate and adjusted to contain 80% ethanol. The resultant precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm pyridine acetate and subjected to gel filtration on a PD-10 column using 50 mm pyridine acetate as an eluent. The flow-through fractions were collected and evaporated to dryness. The dried sample was subsequently dissolved in water. Digestion with chondroitinase ABC (5 mIU) was conducted as described previously at 37 °C for 1 h in a total volume of 10 μl (28Sugahara K. Ohkita Y. Shibata Y. Yoshida K. Ikegami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7204-7212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min. Each digest was derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide and then analyzed by HPLC, as reported previously (29Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Glycosyltransferase Activity of CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3)—Recent studies revealed that co-expression of any two of ChSy-1, ChSy-2 (CSS3), and ChPF augmented glycosyltransferase activities when compared with ChSy-1 or ChSy-2 expressed alone (14Kitagawa H. Izumikawa T. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23666-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Izumikawa T. Uyama T. Okuura Y. Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to investigate whether the co-expression of an additional ChSy family member, CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3), despite having only GlcAT-II activity responsible for the elongation of CS chains (13Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38179-38188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), with ChSy-1, ChSy-2 (CSS3), or ChPF might augment the glycosyltransferase activities. Hence, co-expression of CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3) with ChSy-1, ChSy-2 (CSS3), or ChPF was carried out. To facilitate the functional analysis of CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3), a soluble form of CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3) was generated by replacing the first 57 amino acids of the protein with a cleavable insulin signal sequence and a protein A IgG-binding domain, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Then the soluble protein was expressed in COS-1 cells as a recombinant protein fused with the protein A IgG-binding domain. The fusion protein secreted into the medium was adsorbed onto IgG-Sepharose beads for purification to eliminate endogenous glycosyltransferases, and then the protein-bound beads were used as an enzyme source. When CSGlcA-T (ChSy-3) bound to beads was evaluated for glycosyltransferase activities using chondroitin as an acceptor and either UDP-GalNAc or UDP-GlcUA as a donor substrate, weak GlcAT-II and GalNAcT-II activities were detected (Table 1). These results were distinct from the findings of Gotoh et al. (13"

Previous studies demonstrated that IolG and IolE are the enzymes for the first and second reactions, namely dehydrogenation of myo-inositol to give 2-keto-myo-inositol and the subsequent dehydration to 3D-(3,5/4)-trihydroxycyclohexane-1,2-dione. In the present studies the third reaction was shown to be the hydrolysis of 3D-(3,5/4)-trihydroxycyclohexane-1,2-dione catalyzed by IolD to yield 5-deoxy-d-glucuronic acid. The fourth reaction was the isomerization of 5-deoxy-d-glucuronic acid by IolB to produce 2-deoxy-5-keto-d-gluconic acid. Next, in the fifth reaction 2-deoxy-5-keto-d-gluconic acid was phosphorylated by IolC kinase to yield 2-deoxy-5-keto-d-gluconic acid 6-phosphate. IolR is known as the repressor controlling transcription of the iol operon. In this reaction 2-deoxy-5-keto-d-gluconic acid 6-phosphate appeared to be the intermediate acting as inducer by antagonizing DNA binding of IolR. Finally, IolJ turned out to be the specific aldolase for the sixth reaction, the cleavage of 2-deoxy-5-keto-d-gluconic acid 6-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and malonic semialdehyde. The former is a known glycolytic intermediate, and the latter was previously shown to be converted to acetyl-CoA and CO2 by a reaction catalyzed by IolA. The net result of the inositol catabolic pathway in B. subtilis is, thus, the conversion of myo-inositol to an equimolar mixture of dihydroxyacetone phosphate, acetyl-CoA, and CO2.

MI catabolism in A. aerogenes was studied biochemically, and a pathway of the catabolism finally yielding acetyl-CoA and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) was proposed (9Anderson W.A. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5662-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our knowledge of the molecular genetics of bacterial MI catabolism has been restricted to B. subtilis (1Yoshida K. Aoyama D. Ishio I. Shibayama T. Fujita Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4591-4598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fujita Y. Shindo K. Miwa Y. Yoshida K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Yoshida K.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, the iol divergon, comprising the operons iolABCDEFGHIJ and iolRS (1Yoshida K. Aoyama D. Ishio I. Shibayama T. Fujita Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4591-4598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the iolT gene (12Yoshida K. Yamamoto Y. Omae K. Yamamoto M. Fujita Y. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were shown to be required for inositol catabolism (Fig. 1). Nowadays, a large number of bacteria have genes annotated iol in their genome sequence, but the annotation is only based on sequence similarity to B. subtilis iol genes, as relatively few studies have been done to demonstrate the participation of the deduced iol genes in MI catabolism. In B. subtilis, a repressor encoded by iolR is responsible for the regulation of all the iol genes (11Yoshida K. Shibayama T. Aoyama D. Fujita Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Yoshida K. Yamamoto Y. Omae K. Yamamoto M. Fujita Y. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the absence of MI in the growth medium, the IolR repressor binds to the operator site within the promoter regions to repress the transcription. In its presence, however, MI is taken up by the cell and converted to a catabolic intermediate that acts as an inducer by antagonizing IolR, thereby inducing the iol divergon and iolT (11Yoshida K. Shibayama T. Aoyama D. Fujita Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Yoshida K. Yamamoto Y. Omae K. Yamamoto M. Fujita Y. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consequently, inactivation of iolR makes the transcription of the iol divergon and the iolT gene constitutive (1Yoshida K. Aoyama D. Ishio I. Shibayama T. Fujita Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4591-4598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some enzymes involved in MI catabolism have been characterized. Inositol dehydrogenase encoded by iolG is responsible for the first step of the degradation cascade by converting MI to 2-keto-MI (2KMI), conversion of compound [1] to [3] see (Fig. 1) (10Fujita Y. Shindo K. Miwa Y. Yoshida K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently IolG was also shown to be able to act on d-chiro-inositol (DCI, compound [2]) to yield 1-keto-DCI (compound [4]), and IolI interconverts 1-keto-DCI and 2KMI, indicating that not only MI but also DCI is metabolized through the MI catabolic pathway (Fig. 1) (14Yoshida K. Yamaguchi M. Morinaga T. Ikeuchi M. Kinehara M. Ashida H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 1310-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, pinitol (3-O-methyl-DCI) contained in soybean appeared to be an alternative substrate of IolG, and this substrate was degraded depending on the presence of functional iol genes (15Morinaga T. Yamaguchi M. Makino Y. Nanamiya H. Takahashi K. Yoshikawa H. Kawamura F. Ashida H. Yoshida K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2006; 70: 1913-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 2KMI dehydratase, encoded by iolE, is responsible for the second step to produce 3D-(3,5/4)-trihydroxycyclohexane-1,2-dione (THcHDO, compound [5], formerly called d-2,3-diketo-4-deoxy-epi-inositol) (13Yoshida K. Yamaguchi M. Ikeda H. Omae K. Tsurusaki K. Fujita Y. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The iolT and iolF genes encode the primary and secondary inositol transporters, respectively (Fig. 1) (12Yoshida K. Yamamoto Y. Omae K. Yamamoto M. Fujita Y. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The iolA gene was shown to encode malonic semialdehyde (MSA) dehydrogenase (16Stines-Chaumeil C. Talfournier F. Branlant G. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), supposed to be involved in MI catabolism based on the assumption that the catabolic pathway is similar to that proposed by Anderson and Magasanik for A. aerogenes (9Anderson W.A. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5662-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). But the reaction step producing MSA has not been identified. Homology searches indicated possible functions for the products of the iolC and iolJ genes (13Yoshida K. Yamaguchi M. Ikeda H. Omae K. Tsurusaki K. Fujita Y. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but none has been identified experimentally. In the present studies we tried to identify the functions of iolD, iolB, iolC, and iolJ, aiming to define the whole pathway of MI catabolism and to understand how it is linked to the transcriptional regulation of the iol genes. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. B. subtilis 60015 (trpC2 metC7) is our standard laboratory strain. B. subtilis strains YF244, YF258, YF259, and YF260 are 60015 derivatives. YF244 possesses the iolR::cat mutation inactivating the IolR repressor to allow constitutive expression of the iol divergon (1Yoshida K. Aoyama D. Ishio I. Shibayama T. Fujita Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4591-4598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, some iol mutants defective in MI utilization were obtained by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis, and subsequent detection of colonies were unable to ferment inositol on tetrazolium-containing plates (17Fujita Y. Fujita T. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 864-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complementation test through transformation using various PCR fragments (18Fujita Y. Yoshida K. Miwa Y. Yanai N. Nagakawa E. Kasahara Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4309-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) covering each of the iol genes demonstrated that some appeared to possess mutations localized within iolB and iolC. Subsequent nucleotide sequencing revealed three mutations of iolB52 (Gln-137 (CAA) to stop (TAA)), iolB58 (Glu-162 (GAA) to Lys (AAA)), and iolC62 (Ala-269 (GCC) to Thr (ACC)) as described previously (13Yoshida K. Yamaguchi M. Ikeda H. Omae K. Tsurusaki K. Fujita Y. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Strains YF258, YF259, and YF260 have iolB52, iolB58, and iolC62, respectively, besides iolR::cat, which allows the constitutive iol expression (1Yoshida K. Aoyama D. Ishio I. Shibayama T. Fujita Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4591-4598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. subtilis cells were grown on tryptose blood agar base (Difco) supplemented with 0.18% glucose at 30 °C and incubated in S6 medium (19Fujita Y. Freese E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 760-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 0.5% casamino acids (Difco), 50 μg/ml each of Trp and Met, and supplemented with or without 10 mm MI at 37 °C with shaking. Escherichia coli strains JM109 (20Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar) and BL21(DE3) (Novagen) were used as the hosts for plasmid constructions and expression of C-terminal His6-tag fusion proteins, respectively. E. coli cells were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) (21Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and TGA (22Kaempfer R.O. Magasanik B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 27: 453-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) media at 37 °C. Plasmids pUC18, pUC19 (20Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar), pET30a (Novagen), and pDGHisC (a gift from Kei Asai, Saitama University) were used as cloning vectors. pDGHisC is a pDG148 (23Stragier P. Bonamy C. Karmazyn-Campelli C.

Kanemori M. Kitagawa M. Yanagi H. Yura T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1694-1699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for supplying chaperons to stabilize overproduced fusion proteins. When required, media were supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml), arabinose (1 mg/ml), chloramphenicol (15 and 35 μg/ml for B. subtilis and E. coli, respectively), IPTG (0.5 mm), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and tetracycline (5 ng/ml).TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyGenotypeReference or sourceStrains B. subtilis60015trpC2 metC7Laboratory collectionYF244trpC2 metC7 iolR::cat1Yoshida K.

Yamaguchi M. Ikeda H. Omae K. Tsurusaki K. Fujita Y. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To express iolB and iolJ and produce the corresponding proteins as C-terminal His6-tag fusions, pIOLB-His and pIOLJ-His, respectively, were constructed as follows. DNA fragments covering the iolB or iolJ coding regions, associated with their Shine-Dalgarno sequence and a short linker enabling the C-terminal His6 tag fusion at the head and tail, respectively, were amplified from DNA of strain 60015 by PCR using the specific primers. The primers for the iolB PCR fragment were iolBE (CCCGAATTCTAGAAAGAGGAGGGCTTCTC, an EcoRI site is indicated in bold) and iolBHisC (CCATCGATGCGTTCTAAAATCCATTCATG, a ClaI site is in bold), and those for the iolJ fragment were iolJE (CCGAATTCTTCAGCATGTAATGGATAAAGG, an EcoRI site is in bold) and iolJHisE (CCGGAATTCGCCGACCTGCTGCTTAGCTG, in an EcoRI site is in bold). The iolB fragment was trimmed with EcoRI and ClaI, whereas the iolJ fragment was cut with EcoRI alone, and each of these fragments was ligated to the arm of pDGHisC that had been cleaved with the respective enzyme(s). The ligated DNA mixtures were used for the transformation of JM109 to ampicillin resistance to result in plasmids pIOLB-His and pIOJE-His, which carried the respective iol genes as C-terminal His6 tag fusion placed under the control of the pDGHisC-borne T7 promoter. To express iolA as a C-terminal His6 tag fusion, pIOLA-His was constructed similarly as above but using pET30a (Novagen) as the cloning vector. DNA fragments covering the iolA coding region and a short linker enabling the C-terminal His6 tag fusion at the tail was amplified from DNA of strain 60015 by PCR using the specific primers, iolA-NdeI (GGAATTCCATATGATGGCAGAAATCAGAAAATTAAA, an NdeI site is indicated in bold) and iolA-NotI (ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCGTTGAAATCAGGTGCCGGAT, an NotI site in bold). The PCR fragment was trimmed with NdeI and NotI and ligated to the arm of pET30a that had been cleaved with the same enzymes. The ligated DNA mixtures were used for the transformation of JM109 to kanamycin resistance to result in the plasmid pIOLA-His, which carried iolA as C-terminal His6 tag fusion placed under the control of the pDGHisC-borne T7 promoter. Correct construction of the plasmids was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. To express the His6 tag fusion of iolB, iolJ, and iolA genes, pIOLB-His, pIOLJ-His, and pIOLA-His, respectively, were introduced into BL21(DE3) cells together with pG-KJE8. BL21(DE3) carrying both plasmids was inoculated into TGA medium containing ampicillin, arabinose, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline and grown at 37 °C with shaking. At an optical density of the cultures of 0.35 at 600 nm, production of the C-terminal His6 tag fusion proteins was induced for 2 h by the addition of IPTG. The cells were harvested, treated with lysozyme, and disrupted by brief sonication, and the soluble fraction was obtained after centrifugation. The His6 tag fusion proteins were purified from the soluble fraction using the His-Bond system (Novagen), employing the standard procedure as recommended by the supplier. The purified proteins were subjected to Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration to remove imidazole and salts. The purity of the His6 tag fusion proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblot analyses using anti-His tag antibody (Nacalai Tesque). Enzyme Assays—THcHDO hydrolase activity was measured as follows. The reaction substrate, THcHDO, was prepared by the enzymatic conversion of 2KMI and purified as described (13Yoshida K. Yamaguchi M. Ikeda H. Omae K. Tsurusaki K. Fujita Y. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). JM109 cells carrying pUC18, pIOLB, pIOLC, or pIOLD were grown with IPTG, and the protein extracts were prepared as described (13Yoshida K. Yamaguchi M. Ikeda H. Omae K. Tsurusaki K. Fujita Y. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The hydrolase assay was performed by the procedures modified from those previously reported (3Berman T. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 800-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 0.98 ml of assay mixture was prepared to contain 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm glutathione, 0.05 mm CoCl2, and sufficient THcHDO (giving an absorbance of 0.6 at 260 nm; ∼0.1 mm). After adding 20 μl of the protein extract containing ∼60 μg of protein to the mixture, the rate of decrease in the absorbance at 260 nm was measured, and consumption of the substrate THcHDO was calculated from its estimated molar absorption coefficient of 6000 (3Berman T. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 800-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation triggered by the addition of 5-deoxy-glucuronic acid (5DG) was monitored as follows. The reaction substrate, 5DG, was prepared by the enzymatic conversion of 2KMI and purified as described below. JM109 cells carrying pUC18, pIOLB, pIOLC, or pIOLBC were grown with IPTG, and the protein extracts were prepared as described (13Yoshida K. Yamaguchi M. Ikeda H. Omae K. Tsurusaki K. Fujita Y. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). B. subtilis cells were grown with and without inositol, and the extracts were prepared in the same way as described for the inositol dehydrogenase assay (1Yoshida K. Aoyama D. Ishio I. Shibayama T. Fujita Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4591-4598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation was monitored by the procedures modified from those reported previously (9Anderson W.A. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5662-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 0.9 ml of assay mixture was prepared to contain 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.5 mm ATP, 3.0 mm KCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml of pyruvate kinase, 5 μg/ml of lactate dehydrogenase, 0.25 mm NADH, and 100 μl of protein extract (∼200–300 μg of protein). 0.1 ml of 20 mm 5DG or H2O was added to the mixture, and the rate of decrease in the absorbance of NADH at 340 nm was measured. IolJ aldolase activity was measured as follows. The substrate was the reaction product of the IolBC reaction prepared as described below. IolJ-His was purified as indicated above and used for the enzyme assay. The IolJ reaction was supposed to produce DHAP, and the production of DHAP was monitored by the procedures modified from those reported previously (9Anderson W.A. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5662-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified IolJ-His protein was serially diluted in test tubes, each containing the reaction mixture (100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 3.3 mm DKGP, 1.43 mm NADH, and glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.1 unit/μl)), and incubated at 24 °C for 30 min. Each of the reaction mixtures was diluted 25 times immediately after the reaction to measure the absorbance of NADH at 340 nm. The IolJ reaction was supposed to produce MSA besides DHAP, and MSA would be the substrate of IolA MSA dehydrogenase, which was shown to convert MSA to acetyl-CoA and CO2 with the specific reduction of NAD+ to NADH (16Stines-Chaumeil C. Talfournier F. Branlant G. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, MSA was detected as follows by the procedures modified from those reported previously (9Anderson W.A. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5662-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified IolJ-His protein was serially diluted in test tubes, each containing the reaction mixture (100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 3.3 mm DKGP, IolA-His (5.7 μg), 3.0 mm CoA, and 3.0 mm NAD+), and incubated at 24 °C for 60 min. Each of the reaction mixtures was diluted 25 times immediately after the reaction to measure the absorbance of NADH at 340 nm. Purification and Structural Analysis of the Reaction Products—The product of the IolD reaction was synthesized and characterized as follows. JM109 cells carrying pIOLDE (13Yoshida K. Yamaguchi M. Ikeda H. Omae K. Tsurusaki K. Fujita Y. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were grown in 100 ml of LB containing ampicillin and IPTG for 16 h, harvested, suspended in 2.2 ml of water, treated with lysozyme, disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant solution containing both the IolD and IolE enzymes. The enzyme solution (∼3 ml) was mixed with 250 mg of 2KMI in 9 ml of 33 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and incubated at 25 °C, allowing the reaction to proceed. During the reaction the pH values were maintained at 8.0 by adding NaOH when required. After 20 h appropriate amounts of 6 n H2SO4 were added to drop the pH down to 3.0, and the reaction was terminated. The mixture was heated at 85 °C for 10 min to denature the proteins and then centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm. The supernatant solution was saved, concentrated, and dried. The dried solute was dissolved in 20 ml of methanol/ethyl acetate (4:1, v/v), and the solution was passed through a column filled with 12 ml silica gel (Merck) to remove the remaining substrate and intermediates. The eluent was concentrated once again and dried to obtain 119 mg of pale yellow compound. The 1H NMR spectrum of this compound was obtained in D2O. The IolBC reaction product was identified as follows. JM109 cells carrying pIOLBC (13Yoshida K. Yamaguchi M. Ikeda H. Omae K. Tsurusaki K. Fujita Y. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were grown in 100 ml of LB containing ampicillin and IPTG for 16 h, harvested, suspended in 2.2 ml of water, treated with lysozyme, disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant solution containing both the IolB and IolC enzymes. The enzyme solution (∼3 ml) and 222 mg of 5DG were mixed to make 13 ml of reaction mixture (pH 8.0, adjusted with NaOH) containing 90 mm ATP, 3 mm KCl, and 3 mm MgCl2. The mixture was incubated at 26 °C, allowing the reaction to proceed. 24 h later the reaction was terminated by the addition of HCl to lower the pH to 2–3. After being concentrated to 10 ml and mixed with 40 ml of methanol, the mixture was centrifuged to recover the supernatant solution. The solution was concentrated to 10 ml, neutralized with NaOH to adjust the pH to 7.0, and combined and mixed well with 2.5 ml of BaCl2. The mixture was centrifuged to obtain the white sediment, which was suspended in 10 ml of water, mixed with 10 ml of Duolite C20 resin (H+ type; Sumitomo Chemical), and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The resin was removed by filtration and washed with 20 ml of water. All of the filtrate (∼30 ml) was centrifuged to obtain the clear supernatant. After adjusting its pH to 3.0 with HCl, the supernatant was concentrated and dried to obtain the solute. The dried solute was dissolved in 4 ml of methanol/water (3:1, v/v), and subjected to column chromatography through 25 ml of silica gel with a mobile eluent of methanol/water (9:1, v/v) to collect the eluent in fractions. The desired fractions were combined, concentrated, and then dried to obtain 60 mg of a pale brown compound. The 1H NMR spectrum of this compound was obtained in D2O. The IolB-His reaction product was characterized as follows. The purified IolB-His protein (∼150 μg) and 10 mg of 5DG were combined in 0.14 ml of reaction mixture (pH 8.0, adjusted with NaOH). The reaction mixture was incubated at 26 °C for 16 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of H2SO4 to lower the pH to 2–3 and centrifuged to save the clear supernatant solution, which was concentrated and dried to obtain the solute. The dried solute was suspended in 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) and centrifuged to save the supernatant solution. The solution was passed through a column filled with 2 ml of silica gel, and the eluent was concentrated once again and dried to obtain 9 mg of pale yellow compound. The 1H NMR spectrum of this compound was obtained in D2O. Mass spectra of the IolD and IolBC reaction products were obtained by ESI-TOF/MS (Mariner Biospectrometry Work station; Applied Biosystems). The products were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile containing 1% triethylamine for anion analysis. DNase I Footprinting Experiment—DNase I footprinting experiments were performed as described (11Yoshida K. Shibayama T. Aoyama D. Fujita Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The IolR protein was produced in JM109 c"
https://openalex.org/W2056447311,"One of the mechanisms by which mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS) is proposed to involve the accumulation of detergent-insoluble, disulfide-cross-linked, mutant protein. Recent studies have implicated cysteine residues at positions 6 and 111 as critical in mediating disulfide cross-linking and promoting aggregation. In the present study, we used a panel of experimental and disease-linked mutations at cysteine residues of SOD1 (positions 6, 57, 111, and 146) in cell culture assays for aggregation to demonstrate that extensive disulfide cross-linking is not required for the formation of mutant SOD1 aggregates. Experimental mutants possessing only a single cysteine residue or lacking cysteine entirely were found to retain high potential to aggregate. Furthermore we demonstrate that aggregate structures in symptomatic SOD1-G93A mice can be dissociated such that they no longer sediment upon ultracentrifugation (i.e. appear soluble) under relatively mild conditions that leave disulfide bonds intact. Similar to other recent work, we found that cysteines 6 and 111, particularly the latter, play interesting roles in modulating the aggregation of human SOD1. However, we did not find that extensive disulfide cross-linking via these residues, or any other cysteine, is critical to aggregate structure. Instead we suggest that these residues participate in other features of the protein that, in some manner, modulate aggregation."

https://openalex.org/W2020302176,"p94/calpain 3 is a skeletal muscle-specific Ca2+-regulated cysteine protease (calpain), and genetic loss of p94 protease activity causes muscular dystrophy (calpainopathy). In addition, a small in-frame deletion in the N2A region of connectin/titin that impairs p94-connectin interaction causes a severe muscular dystrophy (mdm) in mice. Since p94 via its interaction with the N2A and M-line regions of connectin becomes part of the connectin filament system that serves as a molecular scaffold for the myofibril, it has been proposed that structural and functional integrity of the p94-connectin complex is essential for health and maintenance of myocytes. In this study, we have surveyed the interactions made by p94 and connectin N2A inside COS7 cells. This revealed that p94 binds to connectin at multiple sites, including newly identified loci in the N2A and PEVK regions of connectin. Functionally, p94-N2A interactions suppress p94 autolysis and protected connectin from proteolysis. The connectin N2A region also contains a binding site for the muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARPs), a protein family involved in the cellular stress responses. MARP2/Ankrd2 competed with p94 for binding to connectin and was also proteolyzed by p94. Intriguingly, a connectin N2A fragment with the mdm deletion possessed enhanced resistance to proteases, including p94, and its interaction with MARPs was weakened. Our data support a model in which MARP2-p94 signaling converges within the N2A connectin segment and the mdm deletion disrupts their coordination. These results also implicate the dynamic nature of connectin molecule as a regulatory scaffold of p94 functions. p94/calpain 3 is a skeletal muscle-specific Ca2+-regulated cysteine protease (calpain), and genetic loss of p94 protease activity causes muscular dystrophy (calpainopathy).

This revealed that p94 binds to connectin at multiple sites, including newly identified loci in the N2A and PEVK regions of connectin. Functionally, p94-N2A interactions suppress p94 autolysis and protected connectin from proteolysis. The connectin N2A region also contains a binding site for the muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARPs), a protein family involved in the cellular stress responses. MARP2/Ankrd2 competed with p94 for binding to connectin and was also proteolyzed by p94. Intriguingly, a connectin N2A fragment with the mdm deletion possessed enhanced resistance to proteases, including p94, and its interaction with MARPs was weakened. Our data support a model in which MARP2-p94 signaling converges within the N2A connectin segment and the mdm deletion disrupts their coordination. These results also implicate the dynamic nature of connectin molecule as a regulatory scaffold of p94 functions. Calpain (EC 3.4.22.18, clan CA, family C2) is a family of Ca2+-requiring and papain-like proteases comprising the products of 15 different genes in humans (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar, 2Suzuki K. Hata S. Kawabata Y. Sorimachi H. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 12-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Calpain is considered a modulator protease, since it modulates functions of substrates. More than 10 calpain molecules are expressed in skeletal muscle, including p94/calpain 3, a skeletal muscle-specific isoform, as well as the conventional μ- and m-calpains, whose catalytic subunits are called calpain 1 and 2, respectively. The functions of calpain in skeletal muscle have been investigated regarding pathogenic conditions, such as atrophy and muscular dystrophy (4Jackman R.W. Kandarian S.C. Am. J.

Defective p94 protease activity by gene mutations causes a muscular dystrophy categorized as calpainopathy (10Richard I. Broux O. Allamand V. Fougerousse F. Chiannilkulchai N. Bourg N. Brenguier L. Devaud C. Pasturaud P. Roudaut C. Hillaire D. Passos-Bueno M. Zatz M. Tischfield J.A. Fardeau M. Jackson C.E. Cohen D. Beckmann J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 27-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). The calpainopathy-type muscular dystrophy contrasts with other muscular dystrophies with regard to the mode of calpain involvement. Unlike the conventional calpains that are hyperactivated as a consequence of advanced dystrophic phenotype (i.e. an aberrant increase in intracellular [Ca2+]) and, in turn, aggravate the symptoms (11Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the dystrophic phenotypes of calpainopathy are caused by loss of p94 protease activity from skeletal muscle (12Ono Y. Shimada H.

Phenotypes of transgenic mice in which the p94 protease activity is manipulated in various ways show that the regulated proteolytic action of p94 on target proteins is critical for the maintenance of skeletal muscle functions (13Tagawa K.

One of the interesting properties of p94 is its very rapid and exhaustive autolysis in protein expression systems examined so far, whereas native p94 protein can be detected at significant quantities in skeletal muscle, where it constitutes a complex with other myofibril components, especially connectin/titin (17Maruyama K.

Two distinct regions in connectin, the N2A and C terminus regions, have been identified as p94-binding sites by yeast two-hybrid (YTH) 4The abbreviations used are: YTH, yeast two-hybrid; E64c, [l-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl]l-leucine(3-methylbutyl) amide; HA, hemagglutinin; I8x, immunoglobulin motif number 8x in the I-band region of connectin/titin; “is”, intervening sequence region in N2A connectin/titin; MARP, muscle ankyrin-repeat protein; dMHC and sMHC, developmental and slow-type isoform of myosin heavy chain, respectively; PEVK, Pro-, Glu-, Val-, and Lys-rich region; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PpBS and SpBS, primary and secondary p94 biding site, respectively; WT, wild type; CS, C129S protease-deficient mutant; DA, D607A missense mutant; aa, amino acid(s); MHC, major histocompatibility complex. screening (19Sorimachi H.

These interactions are thought to impede autolytic disassembly of p94, which has been demonstrated for the N2A fragment in a proteinase-trapping assay, a phenomenon we call “p94 trapping” (23Ono Y. Torii F. Ojima K. Doi N. Yoshioka K. Kawabata Y. Labeit D. Labeit S. Suzuki K. Abe K. Maeda T. Sorimachi H. J. Biol.

Interestingly, in primary cultures of skeletal muscle cells, p94 translocates from the M-line to the N2A region as myofibrillogenesis proceeds or as the sarcomere lengthens (25Ojima K. Ono Y. Doi N.

Together, these observations suggest that p94 and connectin function as a complex in skeletal muscle cells. The importance of connectin as a scaffold for multiple molecular interactions for both the structural and force-generating elements has been recognized (26Maruyama K. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 27Centner T. Fougerousse F. Freiburg A. Witt C. Beckmann J.S. Granzier H. Trombitas K. Gregorio C.C. Labeit S. Adv. Exp. Med.

In fact, the N2A region of connectin appears to be a major site involved in signal transduction in striated muscle tissues. N-terminal to the binding site for p94 in the N2A region of connectin is a specific insertion sequence (“is”), which binds to muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARPs) (30Miller M.K. Bang M.L. Witt C.C.

There are three MARP paralogues: MARP1 expressed primarily in cardiac muscle (also referred to as CARP or Ankrd1), MARP2 (Ankrd2 or Arpp) expressed primarily in skeletal muscle, and MARP3 (DARP) expressed in both muscle tissues. MARPs become strongly up-regulated in myocytes under a variety of acute stresses: cardiac injury and hypertrophy (MARP1) (31Aihara Y. Kurabayashi M. Saito Y. Ohyama Y. Tanaka T. Takeda S. Tomaru K.

MARP1 and -2 are up-regulated in skeletal muscle in chronic pathogenic conditions, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (37Bakay M. Zhao P. Chen J. Hoffman E.P. Neuromuscul.

Int. 2003; 53: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). MARPs are localized both in the nucleus and the sarcomere N2A region, and MARP1 and -2 also interact with nuclear factors involved in transcriptional regulation (40Jeyaseelan R. Poizat C. Baker R.K.

Another example of the physiological significance of the connectin N2A region is that the homozygosity of the in-frame deletion in the connectin N2A region, Ttnmdm/mdm, causes muscular dystrophy, mdm, in mice (43Garvey S.M. Rajan C. Lerner A.P. Frankel W.N. Cox G.A. Genomics. 2002; 79: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 44Witt C.C. Ono Y. Puschmann E. McNabb M. Wu Y. Gotthardt M. Witt S.H. Haak M.

Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 283: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mdm deletion overlaps partially with the C terminus of the p94 binding region and compromises the interaction between connectin I81-I83 (Fig. 1A) and p94 (23Ono Y. Torii F. Ojima K. Doi N.

Biol. 2004; 336: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in mdm skeletal muscle, MARP1 and -2 are up-regulated significantly, respectively, and their specific targeting to the sarcomeric I-band region were observed in microscopic analysis of myofibrils from Ttnmdm/mdm mice (44Witt C.C. Ono Y. Puschmann E. McNabb M. Wu Y. Gotthardt M. Witt S.H. Haak M. Labeit D. Gregorio C.C. Sorimachi H. Granzier H. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Most previous studies have focused on a single molecule, such as calpain, MARP, or connectin. Here, we have focused on the simultaneous relationships among these three molecules. We examined the effect of the mdm deletion on properties of connectin fragments containing binding sites for both MARPs and p94. As a result, the sensitivity of N2A connectin to proteases, including p94, was shown to be suppressed by the mdm deletion. Identification of multiple binding sites for p94 in N2A connectin and of N2A connectin and MARP2 as substrates for p94 protease activity provided a new aspect of the relationships among these molecules. We propose that p94-connectin interaction regulates and facilitates proteolytic modulation by p94 on the signaling cascade through N2A connectin and MARP2. Mouse Experiments—All procedures used for experimental animals were approved by the Experimental Animal Care and Use Committee of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science. cDNA Constructs—The cDNAs for human and mouse p94/calpain 3 were subcloned into expression vectors pSRD and pAS2-1 or pAS2-1c for protein expression in mammalian and yeast cells, respectively, as described previously (12Ono Y.

The mouse cDNAs encoding various regions of N2A connectin/titin and full-length MARP1, -2, and -3 were amplified by PCR from mouse skeletal muscle cDNA using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Connectin fragments were expressed as the N-terminally FLAG-tagged proteins using the expression vector pSRD (Table 1). MARP1 with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) or MYC epitope was expressed using pSRD. MARP2 and -3 were expressed using pcDNA3.1 as the N-terminally HA-tagged protein (47Sato N. Kawahara H. Toh-e A.

Open table in a new tab Protein Expression in COS7 Cells and Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum that had been heat-inactivated before use at 56 °C for 30 min. Electroporation was performed using Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 72 h after electroporation and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl or CsCl, 1 mm EDTA-Na or EDTA-K, pH 8.0, and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.1 mm leupeptin, and 1.5 μm aprotinin). For cells expressing p94, 10 mm iodoacetamide was also included. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 20,630 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For detecting the p94-connectin interaction and MARP-connectin interaction, the incubation was carried out for 2 and 4 h, respectively. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and were rinsed twice with lysis buffer and then twice with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl or CsCl), followed by an incubation with 3× FLAG peptide (150 ng/μlin wash buffer) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were probed with appropriate primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) followed by visualization using a POD immunostaining kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan) or ECL™ Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare). Antibodies—Antibodies used in this study include anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (clone M2; Stratagene), anti-HA monoclonal antibody (clone 6E2; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-MYC monoclonal antibody (clone 4A6; Invitrogen), anti-slow myosin heavy chain (sMHC) monoclonal antibody (clone NOQ7.5.4D; Sigma), and anti-developmental MHC (dMHC) monoclonal antibody (NCL-MHCd; Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK).

An affinity-purified rabbit anti-TPALKK was generated using the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide TPALKK-C (aa 8558-8563 in mouse connectin; NP_035782), which corresponds to the N-terminal region of human connectin N2A proteolyzed by μ-calpain. Before use, the antibody was incubated on ice with peptide RAMLKKTPALKK (aa 8552-8563 in NP_035782) to absorb the population of IgG that also recognizes the uncleaved sequence; the final concentration of peptide was 25 mg/ml. Preparation of an Extract from Mouse Skeletal and Cardiac Muscle—The skeletal muscle (hamstring) and cardiac muscle tissues dissected from mice were frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Cryosections from each muscle tissue, 20 μm thick per section, were lysed in homogenizing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA-K, pH 8.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors as follows: 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm pepstatin A, and 50 μm calpastatin peptide 42 (aa 140-181 of human calpastatin; NP_001035911). The homogenate (total) was fractionated into the soluble fraction (supernatant) and insoluble fraction (pellet) by centrifugation at 20,630 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. An equal amount of protein, 5 μg for each sample, was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis. Histology and Immunohistochemistry—The posterior compartments (gastrocnemius and soleus) of the hind limb skeletal muscles were dissected from 10-week-old Ttn+/+ (WT) and Ttnmdm/mdm mice and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane.

The nuclei were labeled with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole contained in a mounting medium (VECTOR-SHIELD mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were analyzed on a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss), and the images were processed using Photoshop CS2 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Expression of Recombinant Proteins in Sf-9 Cells—Recombinant baculovirus was generated according to the protocol provided by Invitrogen, and the recombinant proteins were expressed as described previously (48Ono Y.

https://openalex.org/W2056950459,"Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) elicits different olfactory behaviors across species. In Drosophila , neurons that detect CO 2 are located in the antenna, form connections in a ventral glomerulus in the antennal lobe, and mediate avoidance. By contrast, in the mosquito these neurons are in the maxillary palps (MPs), connect to medial sites, and promote attraction. We found in Drosophila that loss of a microRNA, miR-279 , leads to formation of CO 2 neurons in the MPs. miR-279 acts through down-regulation of the transcription factor Nerfin-1. The ectopic neurons are hybrid cells. They express CO 2 receptors and form connections characteristic of CO 2 neurons, while exhibiting wiring and receptor characteristics of MP olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). We propose that this hybrid ORN reveals a cellular intermediate in the evolution of species-specific behaviors elicited by CO 2 ."
https://openalex.org/W2145300555,"We recently identified brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the dorsal striatum to be a major component of a homeostatic pathway controlling ethanol consumption. We hypothesized that ethanol-mediated activation of the BDNF signaling cascade is required for the ethanol-related function of the neurotrophic factor. Here, we demonstrate that exposure of striatal neurons to ethanol results in the activation of the BDNF receptor TrkB, leading to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling pathway and the subsequent increase in the expression of preprodynorphin (Pdyn) via BDNF. Finally, we show that activation of the dynorphin receptor, the kappa opioid receptor (KOR), is required for the BDNF-mediated decrease in ethanol intake, illustrating a function of dynorphin in BDNF's homeostatic control of ethanol consumption. Taken together, these results demonstrate that BDNF regulates ethanol intake by initiation of MAP kinase signaling and the ensuing production of downstream gene products, including Pdyn."
https://openalex.org/W2109983326,"Changes in visual cortical responses that are induced by monocular visual deprivation are a widely studied example of competitive, experience-dependent neural plasticity. It has been thought that the deprived-eye pathway will fail to compete against the open-eye pathway for limited amounts of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which acts on TrkB and is needed to sustain effective synaptic connections. We tested this model by using a chemical-genetic approach in mice to inhibit TrkB kinase activity rapidly and specifically during the induction of cortical plasticity in vivo. Contrary to the model, TrkB kinase activity was not required for any of the effects of monocular deprivation. When the deprived eye was re-opened during the critical period, cortical responses to it recovered. This recovery was blocked by TrkB inhibition. These findings suggest a more conventional trophic role for TrkB signaling in the enhancement of responses or growth of new connections, rather than a role in competition."

In polycrystalline metal (gold) films, we observed long-range correlations forming organized patterns oriented at ±45° relative to the mean current flow, even at room temperature and at length scales larger than the diffusion length or the grain size by several orders of magnitude. The preference to form patterns at these angles is a direct consequence of universal scattering properties at defects. The observed amplitude of the current direction fluctuations scales inversely to that expected from the relative thickness variations, the grain size, and the defect concentration, all determined independently by standard methods. Ultracold atom magnetometry thus enables new insight into the interplay between disorder and transport."
https://openalex.org/W2026866678,"DNA mismatch repair corrects mismatched base pairs mainly caused by replication error. Recent studies revealed that human MutL endonuclease, hPMS2, plays an essential role in the repair. However, there has been little biochemical analysis of the MutL endonuclease. In particular, it is unknown for what the MutL utilizes ATP binding and hydrolyzing activity. Here we report the detailed functional analysis of Thermus thermophilus MutL (ttMutL). ttMutL exhibited an endonuclease activity that decreased on alteration of Asp-364 in ttMutL to Asn. The biochemical characteristics of ttMutL were significantly affected on ATP binding, which suppressed nonspecific DNA digestion and promoted the mismatch- and MutS-dependent DNA binding. The inactivation of the cysteinyl residues in the C-terminal domain resulted in the perturbation in ATP-dependent regulation of the endonuclease activity, although the ATP-binding motif is located in the N-terminal domain.

In living cells, a great amount of DNA damage arises as a result of errors during DNA replication, genetic recombination, and other processes (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 1-685Google Scholar). Because the accumulation of such damage can result in various genetic diseases, many DNA repair systems have evolved to remove any lesions. One of these systems is the mismatch repair (MMR), 2The abbreviations used are: MMR, mismatch repair; GdnHCl, guanidine HCl; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino) triphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); OC, open circular; CCC, covalently closed circular. which is conserved throughout all organisms (2Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). It is known that inactivation of MMR in humans has been implicated in over 90% of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancers (3Fishel R. Kolodner R.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The mechanism of MMR has been well characterized in Escherichia coli, and the reconstituted system has been established (4Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A. Burdett V. Modrich P. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 302-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The early reactions in the E. coli MMR are performed by the MutHLS system (5Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6597-6600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), which consists of three proteins, MutS, MutL, and MutH. In this system, a mismatched base in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is recognized by a MutS dimer. A MutL dimer interacts with the MutS-mismatched DNA complex and stabilizes its complex, and then the MutH endonuclease is activated by MutL. MutH nicks the unmethylated strand at the hemimethylated GATC site to provide an entry point for the excision and to direct the repair to the new DNA strand. To complete the repair, the strand containing the error is removed by helicases and exonucleases, and a new strand is synthesized by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and ligase. Homologues of E. coli MutS and MutL exist in the majority of organisms (Fig. 1A), suggesting that MMR is a common repair mechanism among those species. However, despite the prevalence of the MMR system, no homologue of E. coli MutH has been identified in the majority of organisms (7Eisen J.A. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1998; 435: 171-213Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar; Fig. 1A). Therefore, in organisms lacking mutH, the MMR had not been well understood. The research for the primary reactions in the eukaryotic MMR relies on homologues of bacterial MutS and MutL. Many studies on the mammalian MMR have shown that a strand discontinuity serves as a signal that directs the repair to one strand of the mismatched heteroduplex (2Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 4Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A. Burdett V. Modrich P. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 302-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The discontinuities in the newly synthesized strands such as the 3′ ends or termini of Okazaki fragments may designate which strand is to be repaired. For biochemical characterization of MMR, the nicked circular heteroduplex has been used as a substrate containing a strand discontinuity. It has been shown that the excision system in MMR selects the shorter path from a nick to a mismatch (8Fang W. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the distinction between 5′- and 3′-directed MMR should exist. Interestingly, 5′-to 3′-exonuclease activity of Exo I is required for both 5′- and 3′-directed removal (9Genschel J. Bazemore L.R. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13302-13311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10Wei K. Clark A.B. Wong E. Kane M.F. Mazur D.J. Parris T. Kolas N.K. Russel R. Hou H. Kneitz B. Yang G. Kunkel T.A. Kolodner R.D. Cohen P.E. Edelmann W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Recently, Modrich and co-workers (11Kadyrov F.A. Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Modrich P. Cell. 2006; 126: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 12Kadyrov F.A. Holmes S.F. Arana M.E. Lukianova O.A. O'Donnell M. Kunkel T.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37181-37190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) explained how 3′-directed excision is performed by the 5′-to 3′-exonuclease activity of ExoI. They demonstrated that a human MutL homologue, MutLα (MLH1-PMS2 heterodimer), is a latent endonuclease that incises on both sides of a mismatch, and the 5′-to 3′-exonuclease activity of ExoI removes the DNA segment spanning the mismatch. They also showed that MutLα, in the presence of manganese ions, incises a supercoiled homoduplex without other MMR enzymes, and a DQHA(X)2E(X)4E motif in the PMS2 subunit of the MutLα heterodimer is a probable endonuclease active site. There has been little biochemical analysis of a full-length MutL homologous to eukaryotic PMS2. Especially, it has been unknown for what the MutL homologues utilize as ATP-hydrolysis energy. Although the C-terminal regions of MutL homologues show a variety of constructions, MutL proteins from mutH-less bacteria have a C-terminal region homologous to that of eukaryotic PMS2 (Fig. 1, C and E). Here we report the detailed functional analysis of ttMutL, including the analysis of its endonuclease activity. Proteins from Thermus thermophilus are heat-stable and suitable for physicochemical examination. This is the first study of the biochemical characteristics of a bacterial MutL homologous to human PMS2. In particular, the suppression of nonspecific digestion of homoduplex by binding of ATP is emphasized. This result may answer the question how cells regulate the endonuclease activity of MutL (13Yang W. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Culture Conditions for T. thermophilus HB8—T. thermophilus HB8 was grown at 70 °C in TR medium: 0.4% tryptone (Difco), 0.2% yeast extract (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan), and 0.1% NaCl (pH 7.5) (adjusted with NaOH). The TR medium was supplemented with 0.4 mm CaCl2 and 0.4 mm MgCl2 (TT medium) when used for the transformation experiments. To make plates, 1.5% gellan gum (Wako, Osaka, Japan), 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 1.5 mm MgCl2 were added to the TR medium (metals are necessary to solidify the gellan gum). Gene Disruption—The 5′- and 3′-terminal 300-bp regions of ttmutS and ttmutL were amplified by PCR from a T. thermophilus genomic DNA plasmid. A thermostable kanamycin resistance gene, HTK, was also amplified by PCR from pUC18/HTK plasmid DNA (14Hoseki J. Yano T. Koyama Y. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The three DNA fragments were fused by the fusion-PCR method (15Kitazono A.A. Tobe B.T. Kalton H. Diamant N. Kron S.J. Yeast. 2002; 19: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using LA Taq, and then cloned into the pT7Blue vector to obtain the pT7Blue/ttmutS::HTK and pT7Blue/ttmutL::HTK plasmids for ttmutS and ttmutL gene disruption. The transformation of T. thermophilus HB8 or HB27 was carried out according to the procedures described by Hashimoto et al. (16Hashimoto Y. Yano T. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Transformants were stored at –80 °C. Estimation of the Spontaneous Mutation Rate—The spontaneous mutation rate of T. thermophilus HB8 or HB27 was estimated based on the frequency of streptomycin-resistant strains (StrR) measured by means of the modified Luria-Delbrück fluctuation test (17Luria S.E. Delbrück M. Genetics. 1943; 28: 491-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Streptomycin is an antibiotic agent that binds to the 30 S ribosomal subunit and inhibits translation of mRNA (18Carter A.P. Clemons W.M. Brodersen D.E. Morgan-Warren R.J. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). A single amino acid substitution in streptomycin-binding site of the ribosomal protein S12 or a point mutation in 16 S rRNA can lead to the acquisition of streptomycin resistance. Wild type, ttmutS-deficient, and ttmutL-deficient T. thermophilus HB8 were cultured in 3 ml of TR medium at 70 °C for 12 h. The cultures were diluted 1:60 with 3 ml of TR medium and then shaken at 70 °C for 6 h(∼1 × 109 cells/ml). These cultures were spread on plates containing 20 μg/ml streptomycin. The same cultures were diluted 1:105 with TR medium and then spread on drug-free plates. The plates were incubated at 70 °C for 15 h. The frequency of StrR per 108 cells was calculated from the numbers of colonies formed on the streptomycin-containing and drug-free plates. Construction of Expression Plasmids—The pET-3a/ttmutS-expression plasmid was constructed as described previously (19Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). DNA fragments expressing ttMutL and Aquifex aeolicus MutL (aqMutL) were generated by PCR using the T. thermophilus and A. aeolicus genomic DNAs as templates, respectively. The following pairs of primers were used for amplification of each fragment: 5′-ATATCATATGATTCGTCCATTACCACCTG-3′ and 5′-ATATAGATCTTTATTAAGGTTCTCGGGGTAGAGGTGCTTCC -3′ (ttMutL), and 5′-ATATCATATGTTTGTAAA-GTTACTTCCTCCT-3′ and 5′-ATATAGATCTTTATTAG-TAATTCCTGCCTACTTTTTCGTATA-3′ (aqMutL). The forward and reverse primers contained NdeI and BglII restriction sites, respectively (underlined). The amplified ttmutL and aqmutL fragments were ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-11a (Novagen) and pET-21a (Novagen), respectively. The pET-11a/ttmutL plasmid was used as a template to generate D364N ttmutL using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) with the following pairs of primers: 5′-TACGTGGT-GAACCAGCATGCCGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCGGCATGCTGGTT-CACCACGTA-3′ (D364N). Sequence analysis revealed that the constructions were error-free. Expression and Purification of Enzymes—E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was transformed with pET-11a/ttmutL and then grown at 37 °C in 1.5 liters of YT medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. When the density of cultures reached 4 × 108 cells/ml, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.4 μm. The cells were grown at 37 °C for 4 h after induction and harvested by centrifugation. The cells were then lysed by sonication in buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 500 mm NaCl) and then heated to 55 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 60 min, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 1.05 m. The precipitant was resuspended in buffer I and then diluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to 0.15 m NaCl. The resulting solution was loaded onto a HiTrap Heparin column (5 ml) (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with buffer II (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 150 mm NaCl) using anÁKTA explorer (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer II and then eluted with a 50-ml gradient of 0.15–1 m NaCl in buffer II. The fractions containing ttMutL were detected by SDS-PAGE and concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience, Hanover, Germany). The concentrated solution was applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200-pg column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with buffer I and eluted with the same buffer. D364N ttMutL was overexpressed by the same method as for wild type ttMutL and purified by a HiTrap heparin column chromatography, ammonium precipitation, and HiLoad 10/30 Superdex 200-pg column chromatography. aqMutL was overexpressed by the same method as for ttMutL. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm NaCl and heat-treated at 70 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the buffer for the supernatant was substituted with buffer III (50 mm NaPi (pH 7.0) and 1.5 m ammonium sulfate). The solution was loaded onto a Resource PHE column (6 ml) (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with buffer III. The column was washed with 15 ml of buffer III and eluted with a 50-ml gradient of 1.5 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in buffer III. The buffer for the protein solution was substituted with buffer V (10 mm NaPi (pH 7.0)) using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) and applied to a Resource S column (6 ml) (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with buffer V. The column was washed with buffer V and eluted with a 50-ml gradient of 0 –1 m NaCl in buffer V. The fractions containing aqMutL were concentrated, then loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200-pg column, and eluted with buffer I. ttMutS was overexpressed and purified as described previously (19Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of the purified proteins revealed the expected sequences for them. Protein solutions were stored at 4 °C. Limited Proteolysis—Limited proteolysis was performed according to the procedure reported previously (20Nakagawa N. Masui R. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22703-22713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In short, an aliquot of 4 μm ttMutL was reacted with various concentrations of trypsin. The concentrations of trypsin are indicated in the figure legends. The reaction was performed in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ADP or AMPPNP at 37 °C for 10 min, and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of SDS-containing dye (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 10% sucrose, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). The digests were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Size-exclusion chromatography was performed at 25 °C on a Superdex 200 HR column (1 × 30 cm; GE Healthcare) using anÁKTA system. ttMutL (4 μm) was incubated in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm AMPPNP or ADP at 37 °C for 10 min. Then the resulting protein solution was loaded on the Superdex 200 HR column and eluted at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2. The elution profile was monitored by recording the absorbance at 280 and 260 nm. The Superdex 200 HR column was calibrated using apoferritin (443,000 Da), β-amylase (200,000 Da), alcohol dehydrogenase (150,000 Da), thyroglobulin (66,900 Da), albumin (66,000 Da), carbonic anhydrase (29,000 Da), and cytochrome c (12,400 Da). ATPase Assay—Hydrolysis of ATP was measured by means of an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay (21Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 76-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed at 25 °C because the enzymes used to couple the reactions were not thermostable. The change in absorbance at 340 nm was measured with a Hitachi spectrophotometer model U-3000 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). ATP was reacted with 1 μm ttMutL or 100 nm ttMutS in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm DTT, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.32 mm NADH, 25 units/ml pyruvate kinase (Sigma), and 25 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). The concentrations of ATP are indicated in the figure legends. Titration of SH Groups—The experiments were performed according to the procedure reported previously (22Kuramitsu S. Hamaguchi K. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A 135-μl aliquot of ttMutL solution at a protein concentration of 7 μm in the presence or absence of 3 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was mixed with 15 μl of freshly prepared 500 μm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) in a buffer containing 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, and 500 mm KCl at 25 °C, and its absorbance was measured at 412 nm against a freshly prepared reagent blank with a Hitachi spectrophotometer model U-3010 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The molar extinction coefficients of reduced DTNB at pH 8 in the absence and presence of 3 m GdnHCl were assumed to be 14,100 and 13,900 M –1cm–1, respectively. Gel Shift Assay—Synthesized 80-mer ssDNA (Bex, Tokyo, Japan), 5′-CGCAAGCGACAGGAACCTCGAGGGATCCG-TCCTAGCAAGCCGCTGCTACCGGAAGCTTCTCGAGG-TTCCTGTCGCTTGCG-3′, was radiolabeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). The 5′-32P-labeled ssDNA was annealed to complementary ssDNA (Bex) (5′-CGCAAGCGACAGGAACCTCG-AGAAGCTTCCGGTAGCXGCGGCTTGCTAGGACGGAT-CCCTCGAGGTTCCTGTCGCTTGCG-3′) to obtain dsDNA containing a matched or mismatched base pair (X = A and G for perfectly matched dsDNA and G-T mismatched dsDNA, respectively). The 20 nM 32P-labeled ssDNA or dsDNA was incubated with various concentrations of ttMutL in 80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm AMPPNP, ATP, or ADP for 30 min at 25 °C for 30 min. The concentrations of ttMutL used are indicated in the figure legends. The reaction mixture (10 μl) was loaded onto a 12 or 6% polyacrylamide gel and then electrophoresed in 1× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris borate and 2 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and placed in contact with an imaging plate. The bands were visualized and analyzed using a BAS2500 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by fitting the percentage of shifted signals to all signals (% shifted) to Equation 1 using the software Igor 4.03 (WaveMatrics, Lake Oswego, OR). % shifted = 100[ES]/[S]0=100((Kd+[E]0+S0)+{([E]0+[S]0+Kd)2−4[S]0[E]0}1/2)/(2[S]0) Eq. 1 Nuclease Assay Using Plasmid DNA—The assay was performed by modifying the procedure reported previously (23Fukui K. Kosaka H. Kuramitsu S. Masui R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 50 ng/μl supercoiled plasmid DNA (pUC19) was incubated with 100 nm enzyme in 80 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm DTT in the presence or absence of 5 mm ATP, AMPPNP, or ADP at 55 °C for 30 min unless otherwise noted in the figure legends. In the metal dependence experiment, 5 mm MgCl2, NiCl2, ZnCl2, CoCl2, or CaCl2 was added in place of MnCl2. The reactions were stopped by adding 5× loading buffer (5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 50% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). When the effects of adenine nucleotides were examined, reactions were stopped when the initial rate was maintained. The reaction solutions were then loaded onto a 1.0% agarose S (Takara) gel containing 0.5× TBE buffer and 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide and electrophoresed in the same buffer. DNA fragments stained with ethidium bromide were detected under UV light at 254 nm. The amounts of incised and unreacted DNA were determined using the ImageJ software, which was a freely available image processing and analysis program developed at the National Institutes of Health. Complementation Study—The isocitric acid dehydrogenase promoter from T. aquaticus YT1 and the thermostable hygromycin resistance gene was provided by Dr. Yoshinori Koyama (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology) and cloned into EcoRI-HindIII site of pMK18 vector (24de Grado M. Castan P. Berenguer J. Plasmid. 1999; 42: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to create pMK18::Hyg. The pET-11a/ttmutL, pET-11a/D364N ttmutL, and pET-11a/C496A ttmutL were digested by XbaI and HindIII and then ligated into the complement site of the pMK18::Hyg plasmid to generate pMK18::Hyg::WT, pMK18::Hyg::D364N, and pMK18::Hyg::C496A plasmids encoding the wild type and two mutant ttMutL. These ttmutL genes were designed to be polycistronically expressed with the hygromycin resistance gene from the isocitric acid dehydrogenase promoter. These plasmids were then transformed into T. thermophilus HB27, and the spontaneous mutation rates of the transformants were estimated. The MutL Homologue in T. thermophilus—First, we examined the effect of ttmutL disruption on the spontaneous mutation rate of T. thermophilus to confirm the involvement of ttMutL in DNA repair. High frequency mutation to a streptomycin-resistant strain was observed when ttmutS was disrupted (Fig. 1B). Because ttmutS complements the high mutagenicity of mutS-disrupted E. coli and purified ttMutS preferably binds to mismatched heteroduplexes (19Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), ttMutS should function as a mismatch-recognition protein just like E. coli MutS. The same high frequency level was observed when ttmutL was disrupted (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that ttmutL is responsible for MMR in T. thermophilus HB8. Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that the N-terminal 40-kDa region of ttMutL is highly homologous to that of E. coli (Fig. 1C). It is known that this N-terminal region of MutL homologues contains four sequence motifs uniquely conserved in Gyrase b/Hsp90/MutL ATPase family proteins (25Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and functions in adenine nucleotide binding and DNA binding (25Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 26Guarné A. Junop M.S. Yang W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5521-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, there are obvious differences among their C-terminal regions (Fig. 1C). Although eukaryotic PMS2 proteins have a sequence homologous to the C-terminal 20-kDa region of ttMutL (Fig. 1E), there seems to be a large insertion between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of PMS2 (Fig. 1C). To determine the organization of the structural domains of ttMutL, we performed limited proteolysis of ttMutL. ttMutL was digested with trypsin under mild conditions to generate four major fragments with masses of 37, 35, 27, and 24 kDa, which were designated as F1, F2, F3, and F4 (Fig. 1D). To identify the cleavage sites, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of each material was determined. Both the F1 and F2 materials started at Met-1, which is the N-terminal residue of the intact protein. In addition, both the F3 and F4 materials started at Ala-320, indicated by an arrow in Fig. 1E. These results suggest that the cleavage occurred in the inter-domain region predicted on the basis of amino acid sequence comparison, i.e. ttMutL consists of N-terminal 40-kDa and C-terminal 20-kDa domains. ttMutL Undergoes Conformational Change upon ATP Binding—The recombinant ttMutL was purified and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography to analyze self-association and adenine nucleotide-binding properties. The elution profile showed a single peak at an elution volume of 11.2 ml corresponding to a molecular mass of about 130 kDa (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Because the molecular weight of the monomeric ttMutL calculated from amino acid sequence is about 60 kDa, ttMutL should exist in a dimeric form in solution. It has been reported that the N-terminal 40-kDa region of E. coli MutL is in a monomeric form in the absence of adenine nucleotides and undergoes ATP binding-dependent dimerization. The elution profile monitored as to the absorbance at 260 nm showed that no nucleotide co-existed with ttMutL in the solution, indicating that ttMutL exists as a dimer even in the absence of adenine nucleotides. We examined the effects of ADP and AMPPNP on the self-association of ttMutL. It was confirmed that the pH perturbation caused by the addition of adenine nucleotides was negligible under the conditions used in this study (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, middle and lower panels, ADP did not affect the elution profile, whereas AMPPNP caused a slight delay of the elution. The profiles recorded as to the absorbance at 260 nm showed that ttMutL tightly bound to AMPPNP but not ADP. Based on the molar extinction coefficients of ttMutL (∈280 and ∈260, 32,000 and 16,000 m–1 cm–1, respectively) and AMP-PNP (∈280 and ∈260, 2,310 and 15,400 m–1cm–1, respectively), it was found that the eluted ttMutL was carrying equimolar AMPPNP. Because the elution buffer contained no adenine nucleotides, it is expected that the affinity of ttMutL to AMPPNP is extremely high. However, the delay of elution was very slight; therefore we can say that there was no change in the self-association state but that some kind of conformational change of ttMutL was enhanced on the binding of AMPPNP. It was also found that ATP has the same effect on the self-association property of ttMutL as AMPPNP (data not shown). Because ATP hydrolysis activity of ttMutL was slight in the absence of a mismatch and other MMR enzymes (Fig. 2B), the majority of ATP-bound ttMutL species will stably exist under the conditions used here. The ATP-dependent conformational change was also confirmed by the experiment in which we examined the effects of adenine nucleotides on the limited proteolysis of ttMutL. As shown in Fig. 2C, ttMutL mixed with AMPPNP exhibited higher resistance to tryptic digestion than ttMutL alone, suggesting that AMPPNP binding triggered the conformational change of ttMutL. Consistent with the results of gel filtration analysis, the addition of ADP did not affect the resistance of ttMutL to digestion. Thus, ttMutL existed as a dimeric form that preferably binds to ATP. In addition, ATP affected on the reactivities of the SH groups in ttMutL (Fig. 2D). The C-terminal domain of ttMutL has three cysteinyl residues at positions 465, 489, and 496 (Fig. 1E). ttMutL is completely reduced with 5 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of 5 m GdnHCl. After dithiothreitol used had been removed, the time course of the reaction of the SH groups with DTNB was followed at 412 nm. In the presence of 3 m GdnHCl, the SH groups were titrated within the dead time (about 20 s) of the measurement (Fig. 2D, curve a). The number of the SH groups of ttMutL was determined to be 2.85. This value is in good agreement with the cysteinyl content obtained from the amino acid sequence. In the absence of GdnHCl and adenine nucleotide, two of the three SH groups reacted more rapidly than the another one (Fig. 2D, curve b). Although ADP did not affect on the time course of SH reaction (Fig. 2D, curve c), AMPPNP decelerated the reaction of the first two SH groups (Fig. 2D, curve d). The presence of ATP exhibited the same effect as AMPPNP (data not shown). These results suggest that ATP binding causes the significant conformational change of ttMutL. The DNA Binding Activity of ttMutL Was Suppressed by the Binding of ATP—We performed an electromobility shift assay to examine the DNA binding activity of ttMutL. The results showed that ttMutL can bind to 80-bp dsDNA with a dissociation constant of 420 nm (Fig. 3, A, left panel, and B). Interestingly, the nonspecific DNA binding of ttMutL was suppressed by the addition of 2 mm AMPPNP (Fig. 3, A, right panel, and B). In the presence of AMPPNP and magnesium ions, the dissociation constant for 80-bp dsDNA is estimated to be over 5 μm. The same result was obtained when AMPPNP was substituted by ATP (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, there was no detectable effect of ADP (Fig. 3B). These observations were consistent with the results obtained on size-exclusion chromatography and indicate that the ATP-bound form of ttMutL is different from that of the nucleotide-free form in both structural an"

In the present study, we have recorded cytosolic Ca(2+) responses using confocal imaging in astrocytes of acute olfactory bulb slices from mice (postnatal days 3-8). By application of agonists and antagonists, we identified two types of receptors, P2Y(1) and A(2A), that mediated Ca(2+) responses attributable to Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores in the astrocytes. Both receptor types were activated by application of ATP and ADP; however, when enzymatic ATP degradation was suppressed by the alkaline phosphatase inhibitor levamisole, ATP only activated MRS2179-sensitive P2Y(1) but not ZM241385-sensitive A(2A) receptors. The dose-response curve for A(2A) receptors activated by adenosine revealed an EC(50) of 0.3 microM, one order of magnitude smaller than the EC(50) of 5 microM determined for P2Y(1) receptors activated by ADP. Electrical stimulation of the olfactory nerve in the presence of glutamate receptor blockers to suppress excitation of postsynaptic neurons evoked Ca(2+) responses in most of the astrocytes, which were inhibited by blocking both P2Y(1) and A(2A) receptors. Our results indicate that olfactory nerve terminals release not only glutamate, but also ATP, which activates P2Y(1) receptors and, after degradation of ATP to adenosine, A(2A) receptors in astrocytes."

HR plays a prominent role in chromosome damage repair and helps restart stalled DNA replication forks (1Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 932-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, meiotic recombination mediated by the RAD52 group genes ensures the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis I. Accordingly, mutants of the RAD52 group are sensitive to genotoxic agents, bear a strong mutator phenotype, and exhibit severe meiotic abnormalities (2Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). In mammals, a deficiency in HR causes cell inviability and can lead to the cancer phenotype (4Jasin M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8981-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 5D'Andrea A.D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1933-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The mechanistic aspects of HR are best understood in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, within the context of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair (6Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, and RDH54 genes are the core members of the RAD52 epistasis group. The RAD51-encoded product, an orthologue of the Escherichia coli RecA recombinase (8Sung P. Klein H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), mediates the formation of DNA joints that link the recombining DNA molecules (8Sung P. Klein H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

In the presence of ATP, Rad51 polymerizes onto ssDNA to form a righthanded filament called the presynaptic filament. The presynaptic filament also harbors a binding site for duplex DNA (8Sung P. Klein H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 10Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once engaged, the duplex DNA is sampled for homology, leading to DNA joint formation with the ssDNA (8Sung P. Klein H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 10Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nascent DNA joint is extended by DNA strand exchange (10Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sung P. Krejci L. Van Komen S. Sehorn M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42729-42732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Thus, assembly of the presynaptic filament and its maintenance represent a most critical event in HR (10Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); see below).Because nucleation of Rad51 onto ssDNA is slow, presynaptic filament assembly is prone to interference by RPA, the single-strand DNA binding protein in eukaryotes. RPA was first recognized as an accessory factor in the assembly of the presynaptic filament (9Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) via DNA secondary structure removal (12Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Later, it was shown that RPA also possesses a post-synaptic function through sequestering the ssDNA generated during DNA strand exchange (13Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43578-43587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Eggler A.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39280-39288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, because RPA has high affinity for ssDNA, it can prevent Rad51 from binding ssDNA and thus strongly inhibit presynaptic filament assembly (12Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 15Sung P. J. Biol.

This recombination mediator function of Rad52 stems from its ability to nucleate Rad51 onto RPA-coated ssDNA to seed the assembly of the presynaptic filament (7Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 11Sung P. Krejci L. Van Komen S. Sehorn M.G. J. Biol.

Specifically, in chromatin immunoprecipitation and cytological experiments designed to examine the association of RPA and HR factors with DSBs, loading of RPA onto the DNA substrate occurs first, and then it is gradually replaced by Rad51 (18Gasior S.L. Wong A.K. Kora Y. Shinohara A. Bishop D.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2208-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 19Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R.

This replacement of RPA by Rad51 is dependent on Rad52. Aside from its recombination mediator role, Rad52 also functions in a pathway of HR between direct DNA repeats known as single-strand annealing. Herein, Rad52 is thought to anneal RPA-coated complementary single DNA strands (23Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8981-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Several properties of Rad52 are believed to be germane for its recombination mediator function (2Symington L.S. Microbiol.

In addition, Rad52 exists as homooligomer (24Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 40132-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), compromises its recombination mediator function. Although not yet formally proven, it seems reasonable to propose that Rad52 DNA binding function is important for the loading of Rad51 onto RPA-coated ssDNA. In this regard, it has been generally assumed that the N-terminal third of Rad52 is critical. In addition, the oligomeric structure of Rad52 may promote cooperative DNA binding that could be relevant for the recombination mediator activity (11Sung P. Krejci L. Van Komen S. Sehorn M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42729-42732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar).In our continuing effort to dissect the Rad52 recombination mediator function, we unexpectedly find a robust DNA binding activity within the C-terminal third of the protein. We demonstrate that the Rad52 C terminus alone has recombination mediator activity. Importantly, we show that the middle portion of Rad52 interacts with DNA-bound RPA and makes a contribution to the recombination mediator function. Accordingly, a polypeptide harboring the middle and C-terminal portions of Rad52 partially complements the DNA damage sensitivity of the rad52 Δ327 mutant strain and enhances the ability of these cells to target Rad51 to a DSB site. These results provide new molecular details into the role of Rad52 in HR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains—The yeast strains are derivatives of JKM179 (MATα Δho Δhml::ADE1 Δhmr::ADE1 ade1-110 leu2,3-112 lys5 trp1::hisG ura3-52 ade3::GAL10:HO) (36Lee S.E. Moore J.K. Holmes A. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The rad52-Δ327 strain was generated by inserting a stop codon and KanMX right after codon 327 of the chromosomal RAD52 gene, and the rad52Δ strain was made by replacing the chromosomal RAD52 gene by NatMX.Construction of Plasmids—His6-RAD52 harboring codons 34–504 of RAD52 was ligated into the NcoI site of the pET11d vector. His6-RAD52-C was ligated into BamHI or EcoRI sites of the pRSETc vector. His6-RAD52-N/C was generated by inserting the C-terminal fragment of RAD52 (codons 327–504) into the BamHI site of His6-RAD52-N::pRSETc. His6-RAD52-M/C was constructed by ligating the BamHI/BglII fragment of GST-RAD52::pGEX (35Krejci L. Song B. Bussen W. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40132-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) into the BamHI site of pRSETc. For the expression of the Rad52 species in yeast cells, the various alleles were inserted into the SmaI site of the 2μ vector pRS426 ADH (37Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar) to place them under the control of the ADH promoter. The nuclear localization signal GGPKKKRKVG, derived from the SV40 large T antigen, was inserted at the end of the opening reading frame of the RAD52-M/C and RAD52-C genes.Purification of Rad52 Species—The His6-tagged Rad52 species were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Overnight cultures grown in Luria broth at 37 °C were diluted 1000-fold with fresh medium and incubated at 37 °C until the A600 reached 1.2. At that time, isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.1 mm, and the culture was incubated at 16 °C for 24 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. All of the protein purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Lysate was prepared from 20 g of E. coli cell paste using a French press in 100 ml of buffer G (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Igepal, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% sucrose, and 100 mm KCl that also contained aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A at 5 μg/ml each). The crude lysate was clarified by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 90 min).For His6-tagged Rad52-N/C—The clarified lysate was applied onto a SP Sepharose column (20 ml), which was developed with a 160-ml gradient from 100 to 400 mm KCl in K buffer (20 mm K2HPO4, pH7.4,1mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Igepal, and 10% glycerol). The fractions containing the His6-tagged protein (12 ml total; 220 mm KCl) were mixed with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 3 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with 20 ml of buffer K containing 400 mm KCl, and the bound His6-Rad52-N/C was eluted with 5 ml of 10, 50, 100, and 200 mm imidazole in buffer K, respectively. The 100 and 200 mm imidazole eluates were combined, diluted with 10 ml 10% glycerol, and applied onto a 1-ml Macro-HAP (Bio-Rad) column, which was eluted with a 20-ml gradient from 0 to 300 mm KH2PO4 in buffer K. The Macro-HAP fractions (3 ml total; 120 mm KH2PO4) that contained the peak of Rad52-N/C were dialyzed, concentrated to 10 mg/ml, and stored at –80° C. The overall yield of highly purified Rad52-N/C was ∼2 mg.For His6-tagged Rad52-C and Rad52-M/C—The clarified lysate was fractionated in a SP Sepharose column (20 ml) as above. The fractions containing the His6-tagged proteins (12 ml total; 250 mm KCl) were subjected to affinity purification in nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and chromatographic fractionation in Macro-HAP as above. The Macro-HAP fractions (3 ml total; 140 mm KH2PO4) that contained the peak of the Rad52 species were dialyzed, concentrated to 10 mg/ml, and stored as above. We could obtain ∼5 mg of Rad52-C and ∼2.5 mg of Rad52-M/C.Purification of Other Proteins—The procedures for the expression and purification of the various GST-Rad52 species have been described elsewhere (35Krejci L. Song B. Bussen W. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40132-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Rad51 and RPA were expressed and purified as described previously (9Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar).DNA Substrates—The φX 174 viral (+) strand and replicative form I DNA were purchased from New England Biolabs and Invitrogen, respectively. The sequences of the oligonucleotides (oligonucleotides 1 and 2) used in ssDNA annealing and DNA binding experiments and their 32P labeling have been described (35Krejci L. Song B. Bussen W. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40132-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).DNA Binding Assay—Varying amounts of the Rad52 species were incubated with 32P-labeled Oligo-1 (1.36 μm nucleotides) or dsDNA (1.36 μm base pairs; obtained by hybridizing oligo-nucleotide 1 to oligonucleotide 2) at 37 °C in 10 μl of buffer D (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 10 min. After the addition of gel loading buffer (50% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% orange G), the reaction mixtures were resolved in 12% native polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. The gels were dried, and the DNA species were quantified using the Quantity One software in the Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). To show that the DNA substrate remained intact, we treated a reaction mixture containing the highest concentration of the Rad52 species with 0.5% SDS and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 5 min before the analysis.DNA Strand Exchange Assay—The DNA strand exchange reaction was performed according to our published procedure (26Song B. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15895-15904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Rad51 (10 μm) was incubated with ssDNA (30 μm nucleotides) in 10 μl of buffer R (35 mm 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid potassium salt, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm ATP, and 3 mm MgCl2) for 5 min. After the addition of RPA (1.2 μm) in 0.5 μl, the reaction mixture was incubated for another 5 min, before the incorporation of dsDNA (25 μm nucleotides added in 1 μl) and 1 μl of 50 mm spermidine hydrochloride (final concentration, 4 mm). At the indicated times, a 4.5-μl portion of the reaction mixture was withdrawn, processed, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining (9Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Gel images were recorded in a NucleoTech gel documentation system and analyzed with the GelExpert software. To examine the Rad52 recombination mediator function, reaction mixtures (12.5 μl final volume) containing Rad51 (10 μm), RPA (2 μm), and the indicated amounts of the various Rad52 species were incubated on ice for 10 min in 9.5 μl of buffer R, followed by the addition of ssDNA in 1 μl and a 10-min incubation. After the incorporation of linear duplex and spermidine, the completed reactions were incubated and analyzed as before. For the time course experiments, the reactions were scaled up four times to 50 μl but were otherwise assembled in the same fashion.GST Pulldown Assay—RPA or E. coli SSB (2 μm) was incubated with or without either φX174 ssDNA or dsDNA (30 μm nucleotides or base pairs) in 29 μl of buffer T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Igepal) at 37 °C for 10 min before GST-Rad52-M (6 μm) was added in 1 μl. Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the reactions were mixed with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing the beads twice with 150 μl of buffer T, the bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of 3% SDS. The supernatants and SDS eluates, 10 μl each, were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis.Magnetic Bead-based Pulldown Assay—Purified RPA (2 μm) was incubated with 15 μl of magnetic beads containing φX174 ssDNA (30 μm nucleotides) immobilized on the beads through an annealed biotinylated oligonucleotide (38Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) in 43.5 μl of buffer T at 37 °C for 10 min. The magnetic beads in one-third of the slurry were captured with a magnetic particle separator and treated with 15μl 1% SDS to elute the bound RPA, and 10μl of the eluate (beads) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. GST-Rad52-M (6 μm) was added to two-thirds of the slurry in 1μl, followed by mixing for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were captured with the magnetic particle separator and washed with 30μl of the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl 1% SDS. The supernatant and SDS eluate, 10 μl each, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The yeast strains harbor a plasmid of the HO endonuclease gene under the control of the GAL10 promoter, which permits the galactose induction of HO expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was carried out essentially as described (21Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in YEP supplemented with 3% glycerol for 6 h until the mid-log phase, and 2% galactose was added to induce HO expression. At the designated times, the cells were harvested from 45 ml of the cultures, cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min, and then quenched with 125 mm glycine for 5 min. After lysing the cells with glass beads and sonication to shear the chromatin, the cell lysates were incubated with anti-Rad51 antibodies (our own stock) or anti-Rad52 antibodies raised against the C terminus of the protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen). After a series of washes, the immunoprecipitates were incubated at 65 °C to reverse protein-DNA cross-link. Radioactive semi-quantitative PCR was performed to amplify the precipitated DNA. The primers used for amplifying PHO5 and MAT Z were as described (21Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The PCR products were resolved on 6% native polyacrylamide gels and quantified in a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad) using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).Immunoblot Analysis—Cells grown in SC-Ura media at 30 °C were lysed with glass beads in buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and the following protease inhibitors: aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A at 5 μg/ml each) and cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min. Clarified lysates (10 μg of total protein) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with affinity-purified anti-Rad52 antibodies raised against amino acid residues 168–456 of Rad52 (15Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The blots were developed with the Super-Signal Substrate (Pierce).Electron Microscopy—Reactions containing Rad51 (10 μm), RPA (2 μm), and ssDNA (30 μm nucleotides) were assembled in the buffer used for DNA strand exchange and incubated for 15 min either in the absence or presence of Rad52 (1.2 μm) or Rad52-M/C (3 μm). After dilution, the samples were applied onto freshly glow discharged carbon-coated Mesh 400 copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate, and examined with a Technai-12 electron microscope (39San Filippo J. Chi P. Sehorn M.G. Etchin J. Krejci L. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11649-11657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).MMS Survival Assay—rad52Δ and rad52-Δ327 cells harboring plasmids that express Rad52, Rad52-C, and Rad52-M/C tagged with the SV40 nuclear localization signal were grown to the stationary phase in SC-Ura media at 30 °C and diluted 20-fold with fresh medium. When the cultures reached a density of ∼1 × 108 cells/ml, they were serially 10-fold diluted and then spotted on SC-Ura plates containing 0.005% MMS. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 4 days and then photographed.RESULTSPurification of Rad52 Domains—We previously expressed Rad52 and also the N-terminal third (designated as N), middle third (designated as M), and C-terminal third (designated as C) of this protein as GST fusions (35Krejci L. Song B. Bussen W. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40132-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have since expressed and purified His6-tagged Rad52, Rad52-C, and fusions of the M and C regions (Rad52-M/C) and the N and C regions (Rad52-N/C) (Fig. 1). The Rad52 species that contain the N-terminal region of this protein were made from the third ATG codon (corresponding to residue 34) in the RAD52 protein coding frame, because this represents the first start codon that is used in Rad52 protein synthesis in yeast cells (40Antunez de Mayolo A. Lisby M. Erdeniz N. Thybo T. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2587-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At least two independent preparations of each of the Rad52 species were used in our study, and they all gave the same results.Rad52-C Harbors DNA Binding Activity—Rad52 binds ssDNA and shows a weaker affinity for dsDNA (Ref. 23Mortensen U.H.

We show that the prolonged luminescence is not stilbene fluorescence. Instead, the emissive species is a charge-transfer excited complex of an anionic stilbene and a cationic, parallel π-stacked tryptophan. Upon charge recombination, this complex generates exceptionally bright blue light. Complex formation is enabled by a deeply penetrating ligand-binding pocket, which in turn results from a noncanonical interface between the two variable domains of the antibody."

Diminished [Ca2+]i signaling results in impaired T cell activation and, consequently, development of severe immunodeficiency (4Gwack Y. Feske S. Srikanth S. Hogan P.G. Rao A.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Two IP3R isoforms (IP3R-2 and IP3R-3) are expressed in lymphocytes, thymocytes, and splenocytes, whereas Jurkat T cells express all three known IP3R isoforms (IP3R-1, IP3R-2, IP3R-3) (8Sugiyama T.

Binding of IP3 to the IP3R releases Ca2+ from the IP3-sensitive store, followed by activation of plasmalemmal storeoperated Ca2+ (SOC) channels that allow Ca2+ entry (SOCE) across the plasma membrane (7Lewis R.S.

McKay R.R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Because the volume of the ER is estimated to be only ∼1% of the volume of the T cell cytoplasm, it is believed that SOCE is the only mechanism capable of maintaining a sustained [Ca2+]i elevation for hours and days as required for T cell activation (4Gwack Y. Feske S. Srikanth S. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 5Feske S. Nat. Rev.

Therefore, the role of Ca2+ release from the IP3R in T cells is believed to be limited to the generation of a signal that activates plasmalemmal SOC channels (7Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev.

Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas the peripheral blood human T lymphocytes express type 1 and 2 ryanodine (Ry) receptors (RyR) (16Hosoi E. Nishizaki C. Gallagher K.L. Wyre H.W. Matsuo Y. Sei Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4887-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast to the IP3-dependent pathway, the sequence of events leading to the RyR activation and Ca2+ release from the Ry-sensitive store in T cells is less clear. Because down-regulation of IP3R is sufficient to abolish sustained [Ca2+]i elevation and cytokine production following TCR stimulation (17Jayaraman T. Ondriasova E. Ondrias K. Harnick D.J. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6007-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the RyR activation appears to be secondary to IP3R activation. Consistently, the formation of cADPR has been shown to be delayed compared with IP3 production following TCR engagement (13Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Berg I. Skapenko A.L. Weber K. Heyer P. Hohenegger M. Ashamu G.A. Schulze-Koops H. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. Nature. 1999; 398: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, down-regulation of cADPR levels or type 3 RyR expression reduced the TCR-dependent [Ca2+]i signaling in Jurkat T cells (13Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Berg I. Skapenko A.L. Weber K. Heyer P. Hohenegger M. Ashamu G.A. Schulze-Koops H. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. Nature. 1999; 398: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 18Schwarzmann N. Kunerth S. Weber K. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50636-50642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, RyR antagonists ruthenium red and dantrolene inhibited murine T cell proliferation and IL-2 production following TCR stimulation (19Conrad D.M. Hanniman E.A. Watson C.L. Mader J.S. Hoskin D.W. J. Cell Biochem. 2004; 92: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the RyR appears to play a major role in regulating the [Ca2+]i dynamics and, therefore, T cell functions. However, the exact mechanisms by which RyR regulates [Ca2+]i signaling in T cells, and its functional connections with the IP3R and/or plasmalemmal SOC channels, are not established.It is known that following store depletion the SOCE supplies Ca2+ for the store replenishing from the cytosol via sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) (20Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Consequently, store replenishing exerts negative feedback inhibition of SOC channels and termination of SOCE (21Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar). However, the store replenishing via SERCA can be accomplished only if the intracellular Ca2+ release channels (IP3R and RyR) are inactivated. Elevation in [Ca2+]i and/or conformational changes of plasmalemmal Ca2+ channels may stimulate Ca2+ release from the IP3R and/or RyR either by direct interactions or via Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) mechanism (22Galione A. Churchill G.C. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although it is well established that in some cell types, such as skeletal and cardiac muscles, the Ca2+ release from the intracellular store plays a crucial role in generation of [Ca2+]i signals and is controlled by activation of plasmalemmal Ca2+ channels, the effect of SOC channel activation on intracellular Ca2+ release channels in T cells has not been elucidated. Recently, the activation of CICR by Ca2+ influx via SOC channels was demonstrated in parotid acinar cells (23Yao J. Li Q. Chen J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21511-21519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), although the specific type of intracellular channels that support the CICR and the functional significance of the CICR in non-excitable cells were not established.In this study we explored whether Ca2+ release from the IP3R and/or RyR is triggered by activation of plasmalemmal SOC channels and whether it is essential for regulation of Ca2+-dependent T cell functions. The study was performed on Jurkat T cells (human leukemia T cell line) that express TCR and produce IL-2 in response to stimulation with mitogenic lectins (24Dupuis G. Bastin B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1988; 43: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We found that Ca2+ release from both IP3R and RyR was activated in parallel with SOCE and significantly amplified [Ca2+]i signaling in T lymphocytes. Accordingly, inhibition of IP3R or RyR reduced [Ca2+]i elevation following TCR cross-linking and down-regulated proliferation and IL-2 production, the major functions of activated T cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Chemicals—Human acute T cell leukemia line Jurkat E6-1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was maintained in cell culture medium containing RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza/Bio-Whittaker, Basel, Switzerland), 10% FBS (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA), 2% l-glutamine, 2% vitamin solution, 1% RPMI amino acid solution, and 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were kept in suspension in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and passaged every 2 days. Unless indicated, all chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich; ionomycin and dantrolene were from Calbiochem; fura-2/AM, pluronic F-127, and ryanodine were from Invitrogen. (-)-Xestospongin C was isolated from the Xestospongia species as described previously (25Moon S.S. MacMillan J.B. Olmstead M.M. Ta T.A. Pessah I.N. Molinski T.F. J. Nat. Prod. 2002; 65: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and repurified by crystallization before use. Stock solutions of (-)-xestospongin C (1 mm) were prepared in methanol. Stock solutions of ryanodine (10 mm) or dantrolene (10 mm) were prepared in DMSO.Before experiments, cells were plated on poly-l-lysinecoated glass-bottom clambers and then loaded with 1 μm fura-2/AM and pluronic F-127 for 5 min in modified Tyrode solution containing (in mm): 130 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 d-glucose, pH 7.3. After washing, cells were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Some cells were incubated in modified Tyrode solution containing 10 μm (-)-XeC, or 400 μm Ry, or vehicle (methanol or DMSO) alone for 30 min at 37 °C. In nominally Ca2+-free solution, Ca2+ was omitted. In some experiments La3+ was added to modified Tyrode solution and/or nominally Ca2+-free solution.Calcium Imaging—Fluorescence images were acquired from adherent cells using a SenSys CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) and a ×40 oil immersion Zeiss objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Thornwood, NY). A Lambda DG-4 filter changer (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) was used for switching between 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Solution exchange was performed via a gravity-driven perfusion system. Solution exchange in the recording chamber was completed within 5 s. The vehicle-containing solutions (methanol or DMSO) were applied in place of the drugs in all control experiments. Data acquisition was performed using MetaFluor v7.0 software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). [Ca2+]i values were estimated from fura-2 calibration as described previously (26Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Kd was taken as 248 nm (27Fanger C.M. Neben A.L. Cahalan M.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, in each experiment changes in [Ca2+]i were recorded from 15-20 cells and then averaged.Manganese Quench of Fura-2 Fluorescence—Because Mn2+ readily passes through SOC channels (28Missiaen L. Declerck I. Droogmans G. Plessers L. De Smedt H. Raeymaekers L. Casteels R. J. Physiol. 1990; 427: 171-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and is unlikely to be transported from the cytosol (29Chiesi M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2912-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 30Chiesi M. Inesi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 208: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the rate of fura-2 quenching in the presence of Mn2+ was used as a measure of divalent cation influx into the bulk cytoplasm in intact cells. The extracellular solution used in all Mn2+ quench experiments contained (in mm): 130 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.3 CaCl2, 0.5 MnCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 d-glucose, pH 7.3. Changes in Ca2+-independent fluorescence due to Mn2+ quench were determined using the method described by Zhou and Neher (31Zhou Z. Neher E. J. Physiol. 1993; 469: 245-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Briefly, background-corrected fura-2 fluorescence excited at 340 nm (F340) was plotted against background-corrected fura-2 fluorescence excited at 380 nm (F380) during the initial 10 s following application of 30 μm cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). The slope of the F340 versus F380 relationship equals the “isocoefficient” α. The fluorescence value, Fi, which is unaffected by changes in [Ca2+]i, was determined as Fi = F340 + αF380. The rate of Fi decline is proportional to the rate of Mn2+ entry into the cytosol and was used as an indicator of plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability.Proliferation Assay—Cell division track assay was conducted using the CFSE proliferation kit (Molecular Probes). Stock solution of CFSE (4 mm) was prepared in DMSO. Cells were washed, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4 μm CFSE at density 1 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Labeling was quenched by adding 5× volume of RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10% FBS. After washing three times with RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS, cells were placed into FBS-free cell culture medium to abolish cell division and kept overnight in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, the CFSE-labeled cells were pelleted down and a fraction of them (∼50 × 103) were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry to establish the CFSE fluorescence profile of undivided cells. The remaining CFSE-labeled cells were resuspended in cell culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS at a density 0.05 × 106 cells/ml and seeded into 24-well tissue culture plate (1 ml/well). Some cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with (-)-XeC (10 μm), or Ry (400 μm), or dantrolene (30 μm) prior to transfer into FBS-containing cell culture medium. Drugs were also added to the same cells on each consecutive day of culturing. The vehicle-containing solutions (methanol or DMSO) were applied in place of the drugs in all control experiments. After 72 h in culture, cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fluorescence intensity was measured at 488 nm using FACScan flow cytometer and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). The number of cell divisions was calculated using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR).IL-2 Production Assay—Jurkat T cells were washed three times with PBS, resuspended in FBS-free cell culture medium at a density of 0.8 × 106 cells/ml, seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates (0.4 ml/well), and then stimulated with 100 μm mitogenic lectin phytohemeagglutinin P (PHA). Some cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with (-)-XeC (10 μm), or Ry (400 μm), or dantrolene (30 μm) prior to stimulation with PHA. After 24 h of incubation, cell culture supernatants were collected and contents of IL-2 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using Quantikine kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Data Analysis—Image analysis was performed using MetaFluor v7.0 software (Universal Imaging). Further measurements and statistical analysis were performed using Origin 7 software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). All data are presented as the means ± S.E. of the mean; n = number of experiments. Slopes were determined using a linear fit of experimental data to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the data and the fitted line. Statistical differences between means were accepted as statistically significant at p < 0.05, using Student's paired or unpaired t test or Wilcoxon nonparametric test.RESULTSStore Refilling Inversely Correlates with Levels of Global [Ca2+]i—To explore the contribution of Ca2+ release from the internal store to the global [Ca2+]i dynamics, we employed fura-2 Ca2+ indicator and CPA, a reversible SERCA blocker, that allowed us to assess the [Ca2+]i dynamics during SOCE activation and the store content in the individual T cells in the same experiment. As expected, when CPA (30 μm) was applied in Ca2+-free solution, a transient elevation in [Ca2+]i due to Ca2+ release via “leak” channels was observed (Fig. 1A). A second application of CPA following wash in Ca2+-free solution did not produce detectable [Ca2+]i responses, indicating that the CPA-sensitive store was empty. Ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore, applied at the end of the experiment produced only a small elevation in global [Ca2+]i, demonstrating that CPA depleted most of the intracellular Ca2+ store.Readdition of extracellular Ca2+ following the first CPA application produced a global elevation in [Ca2+]i, presumably due to Ca2+ entry via SOC channels (Fig. 1B). After removing extracellular Ca2+, the second application of CPA evoked [Ca2+]i transients, indicating that the store was allowed to be refilled during extracellular Ca2+ readdition. Although on average the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient produced by the second CPA application was smaller than that produced by the first CPA application, the individual cells exhibited a variety of [Ca2+]i responses to the second application of CPA (Fig. 1, B and C). We found that cells that displayed a large elevation in [Ca2+]i upon Ca2+ readdition exhibited a small response to the second CPA application (Fig. 1C). In contrast, in cells that displayed small or no [Ca2+]i transient in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, both CPA applications evoked similar [Ca2+]i transients (Fig. 1C). Ionomycin, applied following the second CPA application, produced similar responses in both cases, indicating that Ca2+ retention within the store may not account for the absence of Ca2+ transient upon a second CPA application.Integration of [Ca2+]i transients evoked by SERCA blockers has been shown to provide an accurate estimate of releasable store content (32Bergling S. Dolmetsch R. Lewis R.S. Keizer J. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We took the ratio of background-subtracted integrated [Ca2+]i transients induced by the second CPA application (CPA2) to the first one (CPA1) (Fig. 1C) as the measure of the extent of store refilling. The [Ca2+]i transients recorded during Ca2+ readdition that were presumably induced by SOCE were also integrated and denoted as [Ca2+]SOCE. When CPA2/CPA1 ratios were plotted against [Ca2+]SOCE measured in the individual cells, an inverse relationship between the extent of store refilling and global [Ca2+]i elevation following Ca2+ readdition was revealed (Fig. 1D).The store refilling in the absence of the global [Ca2+]i elevation was described previously and was attributed to colocalization of the plasmalemmal Ca2+ channels with SERCA (33Mogami H. Nakano K. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 49-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 34Jousset H. Frieden M. Demaurex N. J. Biol.

The absence of store refilling in cells with high levels of [Ca2+]i implied that in these cells intracellular Ca2+ release channels are active and may contribute into [Ca2+]i elevation following Ca2+ readdition.Inhibition of IP3R or RyR Reduces Global [Ca2+]i Elevation during SOCE Activation and Facilitates Store Refilling—To explore the contribution of Ca2+ release from IP3R and/or RyR into the [Ca2+]i elevation following SOCE activation in T cells, we employed (-)-XeC and Ry that specifically block IP3R and RyR, respectively (37Gafni J. Munsch J.A. Lam T.H. Catlin M.C. Costa L.G. Molinski T.F. Pessah I.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 38Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar). When applied extracellularly, neither (-)-XeC (10 μm) nor Ry (400 μm) affected basal [Ca2+]i levels or CPA responses (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, pretreatment with either (-)-XeC or Ry did not affect the rate of the storeoperated divalent cation influx assessed by the Mn2+ quench of fura-2 fluorescence (Fig. 2, C and D). When applied extracellularly, Mn2+ produced a slow base-line quench of fura-2 fluorescence that was significantly accelerated following CPA application due to the activation of the store-operated Mn2+ influx via SOC channels. Preincubation with either (-)-XeC or Ry did not significantly affect rates of Mn2+ quench in the absence or presence of CPA. These experiments indicate that neither (-)-XeC nor Ry release Ca2+ from the CPA-sensitive store or directly affect SOCE.FIGURE 2(-)-Xestospongin C or ryanodine reduce global [Ca2+]i elevation during Ca2+ readdition and facilitate store refilling. A and B, average [Ca2+]i time courses showing the absence of acute effects of (-)-XeC (A;10 μm, red trace) or Ry (B; 400 μm, blue trace) applied in nominally Ca2+-free extracellular solution on [Ca2+]i. Vehicles (methanol (MeOH) or DMSO) alone were applied instead of drugs in control experiments (black traces). Extracellular Ca2+ was omitted and (-)-XeC, Ry, or CPA were applied as indicated.

Base-line time courses of Mn2+ quench of fura-2 fluorescence were recorded in the absence of CPA (upper traces). To record Mn2+ influx via SOC channels, 30 μm CPA was applied 10 min prior to Mn2+ to deplete the store (lower traces). Each trace is an average of 20 traces recorded from individual cells in a typical experiment (n = 5). E and F, average [Ca2+]i time courses recorded from untreated cells (black traces, Control) or cells preincubated with (-)-XeC (E; red trace) or Ry (F; blue trace).

Each trace is an average of 20 traces recorded from the individual cells in a typical experiment. G and H, summarized data from experiments performed as shown in E and F. [Ca2+]SOCE and CPA2/CPA1 ratios were determined as described in Fig. 1.

However, the [Ca2+]i transients during Ca2+ readdition were smaller in (-)-XeC- or Ry-treated cells compared with the control. Given that neither (-)-XeC nor Ry antagonize SOCE (Fig. 2, C and D), the inhibition of Ca2+ release from IP3R or RyR should account for the reduction in [Ca2+]i elevation during Ca2+ readdition in cells preincubated with (-)-XeC or Ry. Consistently, CPA application following Ca2+ readdition produced larger [Ca2+]i transients and therefore increased the CPA2/CPA1 ratio in (-)-XeC- or Ry-treated cells compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2, E-H). Thus, these results demonstrate that activation of Ca2+ release from IP3R or RyR contributes significantly to global [Ca2+]i elevation upon SOCE activation.Inhibition of IP3R or RyR Down-regulates [Ca2+]i Signaling following TCR Stimulation—We next explored whether Ca2+ release from IP3R or RyR plays a role in sust"
https://openalex.org/W2019291236,"Transforming growth factorbeta (TGF-beta) signals through Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways. However, Smad signaling is altered by allelic deletion or intragenic mutation of the Smad4 gene in more than half of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. We show here that loss of Smad4-dependent signaling leads to aberrant expression of RON, a phosphotyrosine kinase receptor, and that signaling by RON cooperates with Smad4-independent TGF-beta signaling to promote cell motility and invasion. Restoring Smad4 expression in a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line that is deficient in Smad4 repressed RON expression. Conversely, small interference RNA knock down of Smad4 or blocking TGF-beta signaling with a TGF-beta type I receptor kinase inhibitor in Smad4-intact cell lines induced RON expression. TGF-beta-induced motility and invasion were inhibited in cells that express Smad4 and that have low levels of RON compared with isogenically matched cells that were deficient in Smad4. Furthermore, knocking down RON expression in Smad4-deficient cells suppressed TGF-beta-mediated motility and invasion. We further determined that Smad4-dependent signaling regulated RON expression at the transcriptional level by real-time reverse transcription PCR and RON promoter luciferase reporter assays. Functional inactivation by site-directed mutations of two Smad binding sites on the RON promoter inhibited TGF-beta-mediated repression of RON promoter activity. These studies indicate that loss of Smad4 contributes to aberrant RON expression and that cross-talk of Smad4-independent TGF-beta signaling and the RON pathway promotes an invasive phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1979245419,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is known to play a role in the regulation of the dynamics of microtubule networks in cells. Here we show the role of GSK-3β in the proper formation of the mitotic spindles through an interaction with GCP5, a component of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC). GCP5 bound directly to GSK-3β in vitro, and their interaction was also observed in intact cells at endogenous levels. Depletion of GCP5 dramatically reduced the GCP2 and γ-tubulin in the γTuRC fraction of sucrose density gradients and disrupted γ-tubulin localization to the spindle poles in mitotic cells. GCP5 appears to be required for the formation or stability of γTuRC and the recruitment of γ-tubulin to the spindle poles. A GSK-3 inhibitor not only led to the accumulation of γ-tubulin and GCP5 at the spindle poles but also enhanced microtubule nucleation activity at the spindle poles. Depletion of GCP5 rescued this disrupted organization of spindle poles observed in cells treated with the GSK-3 inhibitor. Furthermore, the inhibition of GSK-3 enhanced the binding of γTuRC to the centrosome isolated from mitotic cells in vitro.

Serine/threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) was first described in a glycogen metabolic pathway (1Plyte S.E. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). There are two GSK-3 isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, in mammalian cells, and both GSK-3 proteins regulate various physiological responses by phosphorylating many substrates, including protein synthesis, gene expression, subcellular localization of proteins, and protein degradation (2Cohen P.

The binding of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene product (APC) to microtubules increases the stability of microtubules, and their interaction is decreased by the phosphorylation of APC by GSK-3β (8Zumbrunn J. Kinoshita K. Hyman A.A. Nathke I.S. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 44-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We have found recently that GSK-3β binds and phosphorylates Bicaudal-D (BICD) (9Fumoto K. Hoogenraad C.C. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5670-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). BICD is a human homologue of Drosophila Bicaudal-D (10Suter B. Romberg L.M. Steward R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1957-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and there are two homologues in mammals, BICD1 and BICD2 (11Hoogenraad C.C. Akhmanova A. Howell S.A. Dortland B.R. De Zeeuw C.I. Willemsen R. Visser P. Grosveld F. Galjart N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4041-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It has been reported that BICD proteins are involved in dynein-mediated minus end-directed transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (12Matanis T. Akhmanova A. Wulf P. Del Nery E. Weide T. Stepanova T. Galjart N. Grosveld F. Goud B. De Zeeuw C.I. Barnekow A. Hoogenraad C.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 13Hoogenraad C.C. Wulf P. Schiefermeier N. Stepanova T. Galjart N. Small J.V. Grosveld F. de Zeeuw C.I. Akhmanova A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6004-6015Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition to these roles, we showed that GSK-3β functions in transporting centrosomal proteins to the centrosome by stabilizing the BICD and dynein complex, resulting in the regulation of a focused microtubule organization (9Fumoto K. Hoogenraad C.C. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5670-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, GSK-3 plays a role at both the plus and minus ends of microtubules to regulate elongation, anchoring, and stability of microtubules in interphase.Microtubule dynamics and organization of the microtubule network need to be controlled during mitosis in order to assemble a spindle apparatus capable of properly segregating the chromosomes. The rapidly growing and shrinking microtubules in the mitotic phase are captured and stabilized by attachment to the kinetochores, hence allowing the formation of a bipolar mitotic spindle. These changes in microtubule dynamics occur concomitantly with the phosphorylation of many proteins, through a number of mitotic kinases, including CDK1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1), polo kinase, and aurora kinase (14Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that GSK-3 is associated with spindle microtubules and spindle poles and that the inhibition of GSK-3 induces abnormality in astral microtubule length and chromosomal alignment (15Wakefield J.G. Stephens D.J. Tavare J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Tighe A. Ray-Sinha A. Staples O.D. Taylor S.S. BMC Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 34-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which GSK-3 is involved in the regulation of mitotic spindle dynamics is not known.γ-Tubulin is essential for microtubule nucleation, and there are two γ-tubulin complexes, the γ-tubulin small complex (γTuSC) 2The abbreviations used are: γTuSC, γ-tubulin small complex; γTuRC, γ-tubulin ring complex; RNAi, RNA interference; HA, hemagglutinin; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time of flight; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interference RNA; HEK, human embryonic kidney; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MS, mass spectrometry; PI, propidium iodide; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide. 2The abbreviations used are: γTuSC, γ-tubulin small complex; γTuRC, γ-tubulin ring complex; RNAi, RNA interference; HA, hemagglutinin; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time of flight; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interference RNA; HEK, human embryonic kidney; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MS, mass spectrometry; PI, propidium iodide; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide. and the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) (17Wiese C. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 250-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The simplest γTuSC, which is conserved among many organisms, including yeast, flies, and humans, contains γ-tubulin, Spc97p/Dgrip84/GCP2 (γ-tubulin complex protein-2), and Spc98p/Dgrip91/GCP3 and displays low microtubule nucleation activity in vitro (18Oegema K. Wiese C. Martin O.C. Milligan R.A. Iwamatsu A. Mitchison T.J. Zheng Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The functions of γTuSC have been studied extensively by genetic approaches, and deletion of either corresponding gene is lethal, resulting in an accumulation of cells in mitosis (19Zhang L. Keating T.J. Wilde A. Borisy G.G. Zheng Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Geissler S. Pereira G. Spang A. Knop M. Soues S. Kilmartin J. Schiebel E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3899-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The larger complex, γTuRC, contains additional cap subunits Dgrip75/GCP4, Dgrip128/GCP5, Dgrip163/GCP6, and Dgp71WD/GCP-WD/NEDD1 (neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated protein 1), which hold multiple γTuSC subcomplexes together (21Wiese C. Zheng Y. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4143-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Studies in Xenopus and Drosophila have shown that γTuRC associates with microtubule minus ends, possesses higher microtubule nucleation activity in vitro compared with γTuSC, and is required for the assembly of fully functional spindles (22Zheng Y. Wong M.L. Alberts B. Mitchison T. Nature. 1995; 378: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 23Moritz M. Braunfeld M.B. Guenebaut V. Heuser J. Agard D.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 24Verollet C. Colombie N. Daubon T. Bourbon H.M. Wright M. Raynaud-Messina B. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In interphase, most γTuRCs are in the cytoplasm; however, at the onset of mitosis, three to five times more γ-tubulin is recruited to the centrosome (21Wiese C. Zheng Y. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4143-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). How γTuRC is targeted to the centrosome in a cell cycle-dependent manner is not well understood. In this study, we identified GCP5 as a novel binding protein of GSK-3. With the use of a small molecule GSK-3 inhibitor combined with an RNAi approach, we demonstrated that GSK-3 regulates the localization of GCP5 and γTuRC to the spindle poles in order to control proper mitotic spindle formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Chemicals—HeLa S3 cells, U2OS cells, human GSK-3β cDNA, and KIAA1899 (human GCP5) cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. K. Matsumoto (Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan), H. Saya (Keio University, Tokyo, Japan), Dr. J. R. Woodgett (Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto, Canada), and Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan), respectively. Human GCP2 and GCP3 cDNAs and anti-GCP2 antibody were kind gifts from Dr. Y. Ono (Kobe University, Kobe, Japan). Anti-centrin 3 antibody was provided by Dr. M. Bornens (Institut Curie, Paris, France). Anti-GCP5 antibody was prepared in rabbits by immunization with recombinant full-length GCP5 protein. Anti-Myc antibody was prepared from 9E10 cells. Mouse monoclonal anti-GSK-3β and anti-EB1 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated agarose and anti-γ-tubulin antibody and a rabbit polyclonal anti-γ-tubulin antibody were from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP and mouse monoclonal anti-HA (16B12) antibodies were from Invitrogen and COVANCE, respectively. GSK-3 inhibitors, SB216763 and SB415286, were from TOCRIS and Sigma, respectively. Other materials were from commercial sources.Plasmid Construction—pCGN/GSK-3β, pCGN/GSK-3β (K85R), pEGFP/GSK-3β, pEF-BOS-Myc/GSK-3β, and pGEX-4T/GSK-3β were constructed as described previously (25Ikeda S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14066-14073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used to construct the following plasmids: pCGN/GCP5, pCGN/GCP5-(1–567), pCGN/GCP5-(568–1024), pEGFP/GCP5, and pMAL-C2/GCP5.Cell Culture—HeLa S3, U2OS, and HEK-293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum or 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells used for large scale spinner cultures to isolate GSK-3β complexes were grown in Joklik medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. When necessary, HeLa cells were incubated with 30 μm SB415286 for 16 h.Immunoaffinity Purification of GSK-3β Protein Complexes— HeLa cells were transduced with a recombinant retrovirus expressing a bicistronic mRNA coding FLAG-HA-tagged human GSK-3β linked to an interleukin-2 receptor as a surface marker. The transduced subpopulation was purified by repeated cycles of affinity cell sorting (28Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 430-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as follows. Twelve liters of HeLa S3 cells (a total of ∼9 × 109 cells) were centrifuged at 2,246 × g for 8 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cell pellet was resuspended with 6× cell volume of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and shaken for several min. The suspended cells were centrifuged at 980 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended again with 1× cell volume of hypotonic buffer. After 10 min of incubation on ice, the swollen cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2,385 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant (cytoplasmic extracts) was supplemented with one-tenth volume of 10× buffer (300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1.5 m KCl, 30 mm MgCl2) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The extract was ultracentrifuged at 90,800 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The obtained cytoplasmic extract was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at –80 °C.The GSK-3β-containing complexes in the cytoplasmic extracts (10 ml, 100 mg of total protein) were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated agarose (500 μl of beads). As a control, mock purification was performed from nontransduced HeLa cells through all purification steps. After an extensive wash with IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and a protease inhibitor mix (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A)), the bound protein complexes were eluted from M2-agarose by incubation for 30 min with the 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) in 1 ml of IP buffer. The eluates were further purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA (12CA5) antibody conjugated to protein A-Sepharose (General Electric) (500 μl of beads). After washing with IP buffer, the bound complexes were eluted with 500 μl of 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5.Mass Spectrometry Analysis—The GSK-3β complex purified from cytoplasmic extracts of HeLa cell was concentrated by StrataClean Resin (Stratagene). Resin-bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer. The sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained. Each band was excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The digest was lyophilized and dissolved in 50 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution, desalted using ZipTip μC18, and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. All MALDI-TOF mass spectra were obtained in the reflector positive mode using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (saturated solution in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) as the matrix. Analytes were prepared by mixing 0.5 μl of peptide sample with 0.5 μl of matrix solution on a MALDI plate and allowed to air-dry at room temperature in a hood before being inserted into the spectrometer. External calibration was conducted using ACTH-(1–7) and bradykinin. Peptides were identified using the Mascot search program (Matrix Science) to perform theoretical trypsin digests. All visible bands were analyzed, but some bands were not hit by the Mascot search program search. In addition to that, there were bands excised as a single band that consisted of multiple molecules. Only the consistent results through three independent experiments were described.Complex Formation Assay—To show the interaction between endogenous GCP5 and GSK-3β, HeLa S3 cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in IP buffer. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GCP5 antibody, and the immunoprecipitate was probed with the indicated antibodies. To show the complex formation of overexpressed proteins, the indicated proteins were expressed in HEK-293T cells. The cells were washed once with Hepes-buffered saline (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mix). The lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and then the obtained supernatants were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. The experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative data are shown.Immunocytochemistry—HeLa S3 and U2OS cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Alternatively, the cultured cells were fixed with 100% methanol at –20 °C for 5 min and blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min. To measure the accumulation area of γ-tubulin and GCP5 at the spindle poles, each staining area at the spindle pole was measured manually using LSM510 software. For microtubule nucleation activity measurement, quantification of fluorescence intensity of EB1 staining at the spindle poles (1 μm2 circular area) was performed. To show colocalization of two proteins, more than 50 cells were observed carefully, and representative images are shown in the figures.RNAi—The following double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized using a CUGA in vitro small interference RNA (siRNA) synthesis kit (Nippon Gene), and the targeted sequences were as follows: human GCP5, 5′-GGAACATCATGTGGTCCATCA-3′; control (scrambled siRNA), 5′-CAGTCGCGTTTGCGACTGG-3′. HeLa S3 cells were transfected with each siRNA at 100 nm using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), and the cells were used for experiments at 72 h post-transfection.Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation Analysis—HeLa S3 cell extracts were prepared accordingly (29Murphy S.M. Urbani L. Stearns T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. In brief, confluent cells (10-cm diameter dish) were lysed in 0.4 ml of HEPES-S buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and a protease inhibitor mix). The cell extract was homogenized by passing 30 times through a 29½-gauge needle. After centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was loaded onto a 3.3-ml 5–40% discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 0.66 ml each of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40% sucrose in HEPES-S buffer. The gradient was then centrifuged in a RPS56T-swing (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) rotor for 4 h at 314,000 × g at 4 °C. Fractions were collected from top to bottom (14 fractions) and analyzed by immunoblotting.Centrosome Isolation—Centrosome was prepared from mitotic HeLa S3 cells according to the methods described previously (9Fumoto K. Hoogenraad C.C. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5670-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To obtain mitotic cells, HeLa cells were treated with double thymidine blocks with the addition of 2 mm thymidine. After the second thymidine block, cells were released for 6 h before adding 50 ng/ml nocodazole. At 6–8 h after the addition of nocodazole, cells arrested in mitosis were harvested by shake-off. After centrifugation of HeLa S3 cell lysates by a discontinuous gradient consisting of 1 ml of 40%, 1 ml of 50%, and 1.6 ml of 70% sucrose solutions, fractions (200 μl/each fraction) were collected from top to bottom. The centrosome fractions were determined by immunoblotting with anti-γ-tubulin and anti-GCP5 antibodies. The fractions that contained centrosome were then prepared accordingly as described (31Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Smulian A.G. Chan P.K. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Centrosome fractions (400 μl) were diluted with 5× volume of PIPES buffer (10 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.2) and centrifuged for 15 min at 24,000 × g at 4 °C. Pelleted centrosome was then resuspended in 200 μl of PIPES buffer.Purification of HA-GCP5/γTuRC—Forty-eight hours after transfection, lysates of HEK-293T cells expressing HA-GCP5 (three 10-cm diameter dishes) were prepared to purify HA-GCP5/γTuRC as described (32Murphy S.M. Preble A.M. Patel U.K. O'Connell K.L. Dias D.P. Moritz M. Agard D. Stults J.T. Stearns T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3340-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA (12CA5) antibody-conjugated Sepharose (300 μl of beads), and the beads were washed three times with HEPES-A buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm GTP, and a protease inhibitor mix) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, once with HEPES-A buffer containing 250 mm NaCl instead of 150 mm NaCl, and once with HEPES-A buffer. The complex was eluted by incubation with 300 μl of 1 mg/ml HA peptide (Roche Applied Science) in HEPES-A buffer for 3 h at 4 °C. The presence of HA-GCP5 and γ-tubulin complex in the eluates was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-GCP5, anti-GCP2, and anti-γ-tubulin antibodies.Co-sedimentation Assay of GCP5/γTuRC and Centrosome— An In vitro sedimentation assay was performed by mixing equal volumes (10 μl each) of centrosome fractions (0.8 μg) and purified HA-GCP5/γTuRC (35 ng). To inhibit GSK-3 activity, SB415286 was added in the mixture at the beginning of incubation. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the mixture was separated into the pellet and supernatant by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once with PIPES buffer and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.Statistical Analysis—All of the chromosome alignment counts, GCP5 and γ-tubulin area measurements, and microtubule nucleation activity quantifications were performed for at least three independent experiments. At least 20 cells in each of prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase were analyzed in a single experiment. Five hundred cells were analyzed in a single chromosome alignment count. The results shown indicate means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using StatView software (SAS Institute Inc.). An unpaired t test with a p value of <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.RESULTSIdentification of GCP5 as a GSK-3-binding Protein—To understand how GSK-3 is involved in mitotic spindle formation, GSK-3-binding proteins were purified from cytoplasmic extracts of HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG and HA epitope-tagged GSK-3β. As a first step, the proteins were purified by affinity chromatography with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose, and the bound polypeptides were eluted with the FLAG peptide. As a control, we performed a mock purification from cytoplasmic extracts prepared from nontransduced HeLa cells. The FLAG affinity-purified materials were further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with an anti-HA antibody. After the second affinity purification, these proteins were subjected to protein identification by mass spectrometry. Twelve proteins were identified (Fig. 1, A and B). Among them, we were interested in GCP5, because it is one of the subunits comprising γTuRC (32Murphy S.M. Preble A.M. Patel U.K. O'Connell K.L. Dias D.P. Moritz M. Agard D. Stults J.T. Stearns T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3340-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). GCP5 belongs to the GCP family (GCP2 to -6) and has two conserved regions, called Spc (spindle pole body component), in common with other members of this family (Fig. 1C).GSK-3β and GCP5 formed a complex at their endogenous levels in HeLa S3 cells when GCP5 was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody (Fig. 2A). γ-Tubulin was also observed in the immunocomplexes (Fig. 2A). When HA-GCP5 and Myc-GSK-3β were co-expressed in HEK-293T cells, HA-GCP5 was observed in the Myc-GSK-3β immunocomplexes (Fig. 2B). Reciprocally, enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-fused GSK-3β (EGFP-GSK-3β) was immunoprecipitated with HA-GCP5 (Fig. 2B). In addition, EGFP-GSK-3β also formed a complex with HA-GCP2 and HA-GCP3, which are the other components of γTuRC (Fig. 2B). In vitro binding studies using recombinant proteins demonstrated that GST-GSK-3β binds directly to MBP-GCP5 at a Kd value of ∼125 nm (Fig. 2C). Both wild-type and a kinase-inactive mutant (K85R) of GSK-3β formed a complex with EGFP-GCP5 (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that GCP5 binds directly to GSK-3β in intact cells and that the kinase activity of GSK-3 is not necessary for the formation of the complex.FIGURE 2Interaction of GCP5 with GSK-3β. A, lysates of HeLa S3 cells were probed with the indicated antibodies (lane 1). The same lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-GFP (lane 2; control) or anti-GCP5 antibody (lane 3), and the immunoprecipitates were probed (IB) with the indicated antibodies (Ab). The arrow and arrowhead indicate the positions of GSK-3β and Ig, respectively. B, top panels, lysates of HEK-293T cells co-expressing Myc-GSK-3β and HA-GCP5 were probed with the indicated antibodies (lanes 1 and 2).

The arrow and arrowhead indicate the positions of HA-GCP5 and immunoglobulin, respectively. Bottom panels, the lysates of HEK-293T cells co-expressing EGFP-GSK-3β and HA-GCP2, HA-GCP3, or HA-GCP5 were probed with the indicated antibodies (lanes 1–5). The same lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were probed with the indicated antibodies (lanes 6–9). C, the indicated concentrations of GST-GSK-3β were incubated with MBP or MBP-GCP5 (25 pmol) conjugated to the resin in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl for 2 h at 4° C. The samples were recovered with centrifugation, and the precipitates were proved with anti-GST antibody (top). The intensity of each band was measured in the NIH Image software and expressed as an arbitrary unit. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments. D, left panels, lysates of HEK-293T cells co-expressing HA-GCP5 deletion mutants and Myc-GSK-3β were probed with anti-HA, anti-GSK-3β, or anti-γ-tubulin antibodies.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify which region of GCP5 is important for binding to GSK-3β, two deletion mutants of HA-GCP5 were expressed in HEK-293T cells (Fig. 2D). Myc-GSK-3β formed a complex with GCP5-N (GCP5-(1–567)), the N-terminal region of GCP5, but interacted little with HA-GCP5-C (GCP5-(568–1024)), the C-terminal region of GCP5 (Fig. 2D). HA-GCP5-C formed a complex with γ-tubulin slightly, and HA-GCP5-N did not. These results suggest that GCP5 has different sites for interaction with GSK-3β and γ-tubulin. Consistent with t"
https://openalex.org/W2016206520,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a ligand for three endothelial differentiation gene family G protein-coupled receptors, LPA(1-3). We performed computational modeling-guided mutagenesis of conserved residues in transmembrane domains 3, 4, 5, and 7 of LPA(1-3) predicted to interact with the glycerophosphate motif of LPA C18:1. The mutants were expressed in RH7777 cells, and the efficacy (E(max)) and potency (EC(50)) of LPA-elicited Ca(2+) transients were measured. Mutation to alanine of R3.28 universally decreased both the efficacy and potency in LPA(1-3) and eliminated strong ionic interactions in the modeled LPA complexes. The alanine mutation at Q3.29 decreased modeled interactions and activation in LPA(1) and LPA(2) more than in LPA(3). The mutation W4.64A had no effect on activation and modeled LPA interaction of LPA(1) and LPA(2) but reduced the activation and modeled interactions of LPA(3). The R5.38A mutant of LPA(2) and R5.38N mutant of LPA(3) showed diminished activation by LPA; however, in LPA(1) the D5.38A mutation did not, and mutation to arginine enhanced receptor activation. In LPA(2), K7.36A decreased the potency of LPA; in LPA(1) this same mutation increased the E(max). In LPA(3), R7.36A had almost no effect on receptor activation; however, the mutation K7.35A increased the EC(50) in response to LPA 10-fold. In LPA(1-3), the mutation Q3.29E caused a modest increase in EC(50) in response to LPA but caused the LPA receptors to become more responsive to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Surprisingly micromolar concentrations of S1P activated the wild type LPA(2) and LPA(3) receptors, indicating that S1P may function as a weak agonist of endothelial differentiation gene family LPA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1979082329,"In vivo protein kinases A and G (PKA and PKG) coordinately phosphorylate a broad range of substrates to mediate their various physiological effects. The functions of many of these substrates have yet to be defined genetically. Herein we show a role for smoothelin-like protein 1 (SMTNL1), a novel in vivo target of PKG/PKA, in mediating vascular adaptations to exercise. Aortas from smtnl1-/- mice exhibited strikingly enhanced vasorelaxation before exercise, similar in extent to that achieved after endurance training of wild-type littermates. Additionally, contractile responses to α-adrenergic agonists were greatly attenuated. Immunological studies showed SMTNL1 is expressed in smooth muscle and type 2a striated muscle fibers. Consistent with a role in adaptations to exercise, smtnl1-/- mice also exhibited increased type 2a fibers before training and better performance after forced endurance training compared smtnl1+/+ mice. Furthermore, exercise was found to reduce expression of SMTNL1, particularly in female mice. In both muscle types, SMTNL1 is phosphorylated at Ser-301 in response to adrenergic signals. In vitro SMTNL1 suppresses myosin phosphatase activity through a substrate-directed effect, which is relieved by Ser-301 phosphorylation. Our findings suggest roles for SMTNL1 in cGMP/cAMP-mediated adaptations to exercise through mechanisms involving direct modulation of contractile activity.

The contractile state of smooth muscle (SM) 2The abbreviations used are: SM, smooth muscle; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; PKG, protein kinase G; CH, calponin homology; WT, wild type; SKM, skeletal muscle; SOL, soleus muscle; PL, plantaris muscle; SED, sedentary; EX, exercise; PE, phenylephrine; ACh, acetylcholine; ISO, isoproterenol; WV, white vastus; SMTNL1, smoothelin-like protein 1; LC20, myosin regulatory light chain. is largely governed by phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (LC20), which in turn is regulated by the opposing activities of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and myosin phosphatase, SMPP1M (1Somlyo, A. V., Khromov, A. S., Webb, M. R., Ferenczi, M. A., Trentham, D. R., He, Z. H., Sheng, S., Shao, Z., and Somlyo, A. P. (2004) Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 359, 1921-1930Google Scholar). In SM, both MLCK and SMPP1M are regulated, thereby enabling homeostatic control of contractile activity (2Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Exquisite control is necessary because of the essential roles of SM in many physiological processes, such as maintenance of blood pressure. In most SMs, release of cyclic nucleotides (cGMP/cAMP), in response to hormonal or neuronal stimulation, promote relaxation either by lowering intracellular [Ca2+] or desensitizing the muscle to Ca2+ by inhibiting MLCK and/or activating SMPP1M (2Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Targeted deletions of both PKA and PKG in mice produce profound phenotypes, underscoring the importance of these kinases in many physiological processes (3Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiss C. Wang G.X. Korth M. Aszodi A. Andersson K.E. Krombach F. Mayerhofer A. Ruth P. Fassler R. Hofmann F.

Nature. 1996; 382: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In vivo, both kinases are known to selectively target a discrete number of substrates and current thinking suggests that selective targeting is the means by which these broadly acting enzymes bring about coordinated physiological responses (5Beene D.L. Scott J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A few groups have begun to test this hypothesis by selectively deleting PKA/PKG targets in mice. Schlossmann et al. (6Geiselhoringer A. Werner M. Sigl K. Smital P. Worner R. Acheo L. Stieber J. Weinmeister P. Feil R. Feil S. Wegener J. Hofmann F. Schlossmann J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4222-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) demonstrated a major role for IRAG (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 IP3R1-associated protein, with exon 12 deleted by removing the 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor binding domain) in PKG-mediated regulation of [Ca2+] in SM. Disruption of IRAG resulted in a selective loss of signaling response. Other PKG/PKA-mediated responses were largely intact, contrasting with deletion of PKG itself, which produced profound loss of most cGMP/PKG-dependent signaling. Smoothelin-like protein 1 (SMTNL1, NP_077192) is an early target of PKG in SM and is phosphorylated in vitro by PKG and PKA at Ser-301 (7Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Haystead T.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The C terminus contains a highly conserved calponin homology (CH) domain (residues 342-459), also found in the smoothelin family of smooth muscle-specific proteins, whereas the N-terminal domain (residues 1-341) is composed of entirely unique sequence. Studies in permeabilized SM suggested a role in mediating Ca2+ desensitization in response to cGMP (7Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Haystead T.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine the physiological relevance of SMTNL1 in mediating cGMP/cAMP signaling in vivo, we generated smtnl1-/- mice. We show that smtnl1-/- mice have an exercised adapted phenotype, exhibiting better exercise performance and improved vasorelaxation/contractile responses compared with WT littermates. In addition we also show discrete expression of SMTNL1 to type 2a striated muscle fibers. In skeletal muscle (SKM), exercise activates a large set of muscle-specific genes leading to phenotypic changes such as 2b-to-2a fiber type switching, angiogenesis, and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improving metabolic function, blood flow, and contractility (8Muoio D.M. Newgard C.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 367-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 9Sakamoto K. Goodyear L.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 93: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). PKA/PKG-dependent signaling pathways have been implicated as primary messengers in exercise adaptation in both SM and SKM (9Sakamoto K. Goodyear L.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 93: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 10Kojda G. Hambrecht R. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 67: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 11Plourde G. Rousseau-Migneron S. Nadeau A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 74: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our findings with smtnl1-/- mice suggest the physiological role of the protein is to mediate the actions of PKA/PKG in promoting adaptive responses to exercise in SM, and possibly SKM. In biochemical studies in vitro, purified SMTNL1 inhibits SMPP1M activity in its dephosphorylated state, and this effect is alleviated by phosphorylation at Ser-301 by PKA or PKG. In both intact isolated smooth and striated muscle Ser-301 is phosphorylated in response to agonists that elevate intracellular cAMP or cGMP. Collectively these findings suggest a potential mechanism by which adrenergic signals can promote exercise-induced adaptations through regulation of myosin phosphatase activity. Targeted Deletion of the Mouse smtnl1 Gene—The smtnl1-/- mouse was created using standard protocols. Genomic DNA fragments were synthesized by high fidelity PCR from the smtnl1 locus and cloned into a gene targeting vector (OSfrtloxP) (Fig. S1A). The vector was electroporated into an ES cell line derived from strain 129P2/ola (E14Tg2a). Colonies were screened by PCR using a neomycin-specific primer (NeoPro: 5′-acgcgtcaccttaatatgc-3′) and a reverse primer outside the 3′ arm of homology (5′-gatgtgtgctccttccctgagctgtctg-3′). PCR-positive colonies were expanded and re-screened by Southern hybridization. The probe detects an 8.7-kb fragment in the WT locus and a 5.4-kb band in the targeted locus when genomic DNA is cut with Nde1 (supplemental Fig. S1B). Targeted clones were injected into blastocysts derived from strain C75BL/6(B6). Male chimeras demonstrating gene transmission were crossed with 129S6/SvEvTac(129) females, and heterozygous offspring from that cross were back-crossed over 9 generations to a 129 background. Mice were genotyped using a multiplex PCR reaction with three primers: NeoPro, acgcgtcaccttaatatgc; smtnlWT, ttcacctttgaccc; and smtnl1Rev, caaaagagacctggc (supplemental Fig. S1C). Immunohistochemistry and Indirect Immunofluorescent Fiber Typing—Formalin (10%)-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse tissues and timed embryos were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using anti-SMTNL1 (Proteintech Inc.). Fiber typing by immunofluorescent fiber typing was performed as described (12Akimoto T. Ribar T.J. Williams R.S. Yan Z. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C1311-C1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Soleus (SOL) and plantaris (PL) muscles were harvested and frozen in liquid N2-cooled isopentane. Frozen cross-sections (8 μm) were immunostained against MHC I, 2a, and 2b, dystrophin, and SMTNL1. Longitudinal sections were immunostained with anti-myomesin (clone B4), and F-actin was visualized with phalloidin-Alexa488. Treadmill Exercise Protocol—8-week-old 129 mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Mice exposed to the treadmill but not exercise comprised the sedentary (SED) group, those that ran on the treadmill were the exercise (EX) group. Mice were exercised 3 h into their dark cycle on a 2-lane enclosed treadmill. The treadmill stress and endurance protocols were performed as described (13Haubold, K. W., Allen, D. L., Capetanaki, Y., and Leinwand, L. A. (2003) J. Appl. Physiol. 95, 1617-1622Google Scholar). Mice were acclimated to the treadmill at 5 m/min at an 8° incline for 10 min for 2 days before testing. For baseline and final stress tests, an incremental protocol was used: 8.5 m/min, 0° incline, 9 min; then the speed increased by 2.5 m/min every 3 min to a maximum of 40 m/min and incline increase 5° every 9 min to a maximum of 15°. Time to fatigue was determined when mice could not maintain sufficient speed to remain off the shock grid for 15 s. This test was repeated twice with a 48-h rest between tests for each mouse before and after a 5-week endurance training protocol, and results were averaged. Performance was determined through calculation of time to fatigue (minutes), distance run (in meters, calculated from run time and speed of treadmill), and vertical work performed (kg·m). Vertical work was calculated as a product of body weight (kilograms) and vertical distance (meters). Mice were euthanized 24 h after the final stress test, and tissues and serum were collected. Isometric Force Measurements in Aortic Rings—Descending thoracic aortas from SED and EX mice were placed in Krebs solution, continuously aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2, at 37 °C. Aortic rings (3 mm) were mounted in a wire myograph as described previously (14Pannirselvam M. Simon V. Verma S. Anderson T. Triggle C.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Passive stretch was set to 15 millinewtons to simulate the wall tension generated by 100 mmHg of blood pressure. After 30 min of equilibration, 3 cycles of constriction to phenylephrine (PE) were completed, followed by a dose-response curve to PE. Aortic rings were preconstricted with PE, and dose-response curves to acetylcholine (ACh) were determined. Western Blot of Ser-301 Phosphorylation in Vivo—The specificity of the pSMTNL1S301 antibody (Proteintech, Inc.) was tested against recombinant (rSMTLN1) and S301A SMTLN1 (rS301A) phosphorylated with purified PKA as described before (7Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Haystead T.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To test Ser-301 phosphorylation in vivo by Western, isolated aortas held under tension (15 millinewtons), with pinned bladder and SOL equilibrated in Krebs as described (15Wooldridge A.A. MacDonald J.A. Erdodi F. Ma C. Borman M.A. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34496-34504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), were stimulated with vehicle, ISO, or 8-bromo-cAMP and snap frozen. Lysates were Western blotted with anti-pSMTNL1S301. Assay of SMPP1M—SMPP1M and SM myosin were purified from pig bladder as described (16Shirazi A. Iizuka K. Fadden P. Mosse C. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31598-31606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified myosin was phosphorylated with rZIPK to ∼1.4 mol using the following conditions; 1.0 ml of 2 mg/ml myosin (SM or SKM), 10 μg of rZIPK (truncated at Ser-276), 200 μm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl for 30 min (22 °C), followed by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Phosphatase assays were performed as described (16Shirazi A. Iizuka K. Fadden P. Mosse C. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31598-31606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments examining the effects of SMTNL1 on SMPP1M activity in vitro, ∼2 mg of purified rSMTNL1 was phosphorylated to stoichiometry with purified PKA as described before (7Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Haystead T.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Direct phosphorylation site analysis confirmed exclusive phosphorylation of Ser-301. Disruption of the smtnl1 Gene—Genotyping of targeted mice by PCR and Southern hybridization confirmed gene deletion (supplemental Fig. S1, A-C). Deletion of SMTNL1 at the protein level was confirmed by Western analysis of SKM extracts (Fig. 1A). Basal activity, litter sizes, and embryonic development of the smtnl1-/- mice were normal. Extensive histological analysis of various blood vessels and general tissues showed these to be normal in smtnl1-/- mice. Additionally, electron microscopy of SKM sections showed the muscle ultrastructure was normal (supplemental Fig. S2). Western analysis of a battery of tissues showed SMTNL1 expression to be highest in SKM relative to SM and other tissues (Fig. 1B). Within individual striated muscles, SMTNL1 is significantly more expressed in SOL compared with PL or white vastus (WV), suggesting the protein is preferentially expressed in muscles containing Type I or Type 2a fibers (Fig. 1C). Histological Examination of WT, smtnl1-/- Mice and Human SKM Shows Exclusive Expression of SMTNL1 in Type 2a Fibers—Immunohistochemical analysis of SKM and heart showed strong staining in the mixed fiber muscle PL (Fig. 2, A and B) but was absent in sections of fast twitch type 2b muscle WV and the oxidative type I/b heart muscle (Fig. 2, C and D). To determine the specific fiber type expressing SMTNL1, sections from SOL and PL muscles were examined by immunofluorescent fiber typing confocal microscopy. Fig. 2 (E-L) shows SMTNL1 staining co-localized with MHC-2A fibers in SOL and PL, with no staining in MHC-1, MHC-2B, or MHC-2x/d fibers. Specificity of staining was confirmed by competition with rSMTNL1 and analysis of SKM from smtnl1-/- mice (supplemental Fig. S3). Longitudinal sections of SKM stained with phalloidin and anti-myomesin showed that SMTLN1 is specifically localized to the I-band and M-line, but absent in the Z-line (supplemental Fig. S4). Immunohistochemical analysis of timed embryos demonstrated SMTNL1 expression in axial SKM beginning at day E14.5 (supplemental Fig. S5). To verify relevance to human physiology, frozen sections of vastus lateralis biopsy from a study of young men pre and post 8 weeks of stationary bicycle training were evaluated by immunofluorescent fiber typing for SMTNL1 expression and fiber typing. Fig. 2 (M and N) shows expression of SMTNL1 is specific to type 2a fibers in humans. We are currently investigating whether exercise alters the SMTNL1 expression levels in human. Male smtnl1-/- Mice Perform Better Than WT in Exercise Stress Test after Endurance Training—Given the role of type 2a fibers in endurance exercise adaptation and the finding that SMTNL1 is only expressed in those fibers within SKM of both mice and men, we investigated the exercise performance of smtnl1-/- mice. Fig. 3 shows all mice demonstrated similar performance at the beginning of the study. All EX mice ran the same time and distance during the endurance portion of the training, but subjectively, the smtnl1-/- mice demonstrated more willingness to run and required fewer motivational stimuli, such as air puffs, throughout the 5-week protocol. Forty-eight hours after the end of exercise training, the mice were subjected to two more graded stress tests. Results of the stress tests showed female EX smtnl1-/- mice did not differ significantly from the female EX WT mice: (time to fatigue: WT 24.6 ± 0.8 min baseline, 33.1 ± 1.0 min final; smtnl1-/- 24.2 ± 1.2 min baseline, 35.6 ± 1.1 min final). However, male EX smtnl1-/- mice showed significantly increased time to fatigue, distance run, and vertical work performed compared with male EX WT mice after training (Fig. 3, A-C). Endothelium-dependent Vasorelaxation of the Aorta Is Enhanced, and Responses to α-Adrenergic Constriction Are Reduced in smtnl1-/- Mice—Endurance training is known to improve vascular performance. To investigate the impact of SMTNL1 deletion on the contractile properties of SM, isolated aorta from SED and EX mice were mounted for isometric force measurement. To test NO-mediated, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, dose-response curves to ACh were generated. Aortas from SED smtnl1-/- mice showed significantly greater relaxation to ACh compared with WT littermates (Fig. 4, A-D). The extent of relaxation in smtnl1-/- was similar to that from EX WT mice. Therefore exercise did not improve relaxation in aortic rings from smtnl1-/- mice beyond that achieved in ACh-treated EX WT mice (Fig. 4, E and F). These findings show that deletion of SMTNL1 improves vascular responsiveness to ACh, suggesting a role in cGMP/PKG-dependent vascular adaptations to exercise. To determine if the improvements in vascular relaxation were due to alteration in endothelial nitricoxide synthase expression or phosphorylation, we also evaluated these parameters in WT and smtnl1-/- aorta lysates by Western blot. However, no differences in endothelial nitric-oxide synthase phosphorylation or expression were observed. To investigate the effects of SMTNL1 deletion on contractile activity in response to exercise, aortic rings were stimulated with increasing doses of PE. Fig. 4 (G and I) shows that WT SED and EX males generated greater isometric force per cross-section area at doses above 1 μm PE when compared with smtnl1-/- males in the same exercise category. In the case of SED or EX smtnl1-/- mice, the differences in force cannot be attributed to decreased sensitivity to PE. Comparison of EC50 in response to PE values with respect to isometric force development in both aortas from WT and smtnl1-/- did not show significant differences. These findings suggest that the absence of SMTNL1 does not result in receptor desensitization due to either reduced expression of α-adrenergic receptors or through compensatory signaling mechanisms that down-regulate receptor activity. In female mice, the differences in isometric force generated in response to PE between SED or EX WT and smtnl1-/- were less significant (Fig. 4, H and J). This may be reflective of expression levels of SMTNL1 between sexes. Generally, Western analysis of tissues expressing SMTNL1 showed 30-40% less expression in females relative to males (supplemental Fig. S6). As a result, SED WT female mice may already be closer to smtnl1-/- males with respect to their responsiveness to α-adrenergic agonists. No effect on relaxation or force development was observed in tracheal rings isolated from SED or EX, WT or smtnl1-/- mice. These findings are consistent with immunoblot Western data showing that SMTNL1 is not expressed in airway SM (data not shown). Other vessels expressing SMTNL1 have yet to be evaluated. Deletion of SMTNL1 Induces Fiber Adaptations in SKM—To determine if deletion of SMTNL1 significantly altered the proportion type 2a fibers in a manner similar to that induced by exercise, we first evaluated SKM fiber adaptation by immunohistochemical approaches. As reported by others, in all examined fibers from WT mice, the percentage of 2a fibers increased, whereas, the percentage of 2b fibers decreased in response to endurance exercise (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, as determine by fiber typing, SED smtnl1-/- mice had the same percentage of 2a fibers as EX WT mice, suggesting SED smtnl1-/- mice have more type 2A fibers at baseline (Table 1). Although, the percentage of 2a fibers did not increase further in EX smtnl1-/- mice. Like Ex mice, SED smtnl1-/- mice showed significantly lower level of type1b fibers, implying an adaptive response had occurred. The numbers of type 1 and type 2x/d fibers were unaffected with respect to genotype or exercise status (Table 1).TABLE 1SMTNL1 deletion induces type 2A fibers and reduces type 2B fibers to a similar extent to that observed in exercised miceMHC-1MHC-2AMHC-2BMHC-2x/dSedExSedExSedExSedEx%smtnl1+/+1.9 ± 1.60.8 ± 0.226.5 ± 1.137.9 ± 2.0ap < 0.001 versus WT Sec 2a.54.4 ± 2.636.5 ± 2.6bp < 0.001 versus WT Sec 2b.17.3 ± 1.421.6 ± 1.1smtnl1−/−1.4 ± 0.61.6 ± 0.434.3 ± 1.8cp < 0.01 versus WT Sed 2a.36.8 ± 1.544 ± 2.9dp < 0.05 versus WT Sed.39.6 ± 3.022.0 ± 1.522.4 ± 1.1a p < 0.001 versus WT Sec 2a.b p < 0.001 versus WT Sec 2b.c p < 0.01 versus WT Sed 2a.d p < 0.05 versus WT Sed. Open table in a new tab The finding that SED smtnl1-/- mice exhibit fiber adaptations as well as perform better in exercise suggests that exercise may reduce SMTNL1 expression in vivo. Consistent with this hypothesis, Western analysis of SOL isolated from EX mice showed a significant reduction in expression of the protein in male and female mice (Fig. 5B). Similar trends were observed in SM, although the extent of the change was not statistically significant. These results indicate that improvements in exercise performance in smtnl1-/- mice are likely to be either related to improved blood flow due to adaptations within the vascular smooth muscle, and/or, alterations in pathways directly regulating contractile activity. In addition to demonstrating changes in MHC2a and MH2b expression in fiber typing experiments, we also examined other known markers of exercise adaptation by Western blot, including the mitochondrial markers PGC-1α and COX1V by Western blot. Although, as shown by others, these markers were induced by exercise, no differences were observed between SED smtnl1-/- mice and SED WT littermates (supplemental Fig. S7A). Body and Muscle Weight, Capillary Contacts, Glucose Tolerance, Serum Chemistry Values, PL Muscle Time to Fatigue in smtnl1-/- and WT Mice—Other potential compensatory mechanisms that could explain the smtnl1-/- phenotype were also evaluated, including overnight fasted glucose levels, resting blood pressure (supplemental Fig. S7, B and C) serum muscle enzyme activities (creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase), total Ca, Mg, P, Na+, K+, Cl-, and albumin levels. All values were within normal ranges with no differences between groups. Body and muscle weight were also not different (supplemental Table S1). We asked whether capillary density was altered in the smtnl1-/- mice. Capillary contacts increased in type 2A fibers with exercise as expected, but there was no difference between WT and smtnl1-/- mice (supplemental Fig. S8A). Evaluation of time to fatigue of PL muscle after tetanic stimulation in smtnl1-/- and WT mice showed similar times to fatigue of ∼20s (supplemental Fig. S8B). Because SKM consists of mixed fibers (e.g. PL, <30% type 2a; SOL, ∼40%) more complete assessment of the effects of SMTNL1 deletion on contractile activity in SKM will require studies on isolated 2a fibers. SMTNL1 Phosphorylation Is Regulated in SM and SKM in Vivo—Previously, using a phosphoproteomic approach, we identified SMTNL1 as an early target of PKG activation following addition of 8-bromo-cGMP to permeabilized ileal smooth muscle (7Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Haystead T.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In vitro, using rSMTNL1, we showed that the protein is an excellent substrate for both PKG and PKA. Both protein kinases phosphorylate SMTNL1 at a single site, Ser-301. To determine if SMTNL1 is phosphorylated in intact smooth muscles, we generated phosphospecific antibodies to Ser-301. Specificity of the antibody was confirmed by Western blotting against WT rSMTNL1 and a recombinant S301A mutant of the protein (rSMTNL1S301A) following in vitro phosphorylation of the protein with purified PKA. Fig. 6A shows the antibody specifically recognizes only the phosphorylated form of the protein and not the non-phosphorylated form or rSMTNL1S301A. Having demonstrated specificity for the phospho-Ser-301 in vitro, we examined phosphorylation in vivo. Isolated intact aortas held under tension were treated with physiological concentrations of norepinephrine, isoproterenol (ISO), acetylcholine, 8-bromo-cGMP, and 8-bromo-cAMP for times observed to produced maximal relaxation as determined in Fig. 4. The treated vessels were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue extracts were blotted for Ser-301 phosphorylation. Fig. 6B shows that all five agonists produce robust phosphorylation of Ser-301, demonstrating that in aorta SMTNL1 is regulated by cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways activated by both endothelial-dependent (ACh) and -independent pathways (norepinephrine and ISO). Significantly, maximal phosphorylation of Ser-301 was found to correlate with maximal relaxation of aorta in response to ACh as observed in Fig. 4. Similar results were also observed in studies with isolated bladder treated with 8-bromo-cGMP (data not shown). To test whether SMTNL1 is phosphorylated in striated muscle, isolated SOL held under tension were treated with ISO over the indicated time course and fixed time point then frozen in liquid nitrogen, and extracts were blotted for Ser-301 phosphorylation (Fig. 6, C and D). Fig. 6 (C and D) shows that SMTNL1 is robustly phosphorylated in striated muscle and therefore likely to be directly regulated by PKA in this tissue. SMTNL1 Inhibits SMPP1M Activity toward Myosin through a Substrate-directed Effect That Is Alleviated by Ser-301 Phosphorylation—The finding that exercise reduces SMTNL1 expression in SM and SKM, as well as the finding that Ser-301 is phosphorylated in vivo in response to both endothelial dependent agonists as well β-adrenergic agonists, suggests a role in the regulation of contraction. This hypothesis is supported by earlier studies from our laboratory demonstrating an effect of rSMTNL1 on Ca2+-desensitization pathways when added to permeabilized SM (7Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Haystead T.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), myosin, and myosin phosphatase (SMPP1M) have all been directly implicated in mediating Ca2+ desensitization in SM (1Somlyo, A. V., Khromov, A. S., Webb, M.

The phosphorylated form of SMTNL1 was generated by phosphorylating rSMTNL1 to ∼1 mol/mol with purified PKA as described (7Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Haystead T.A.

Phosphopeptide sequence and phospho amino acid analysis confirmed that PKA phosphorylated SMTNL1 at a single site of Ser-301 (Fig. 7, A and B). To investigate whether phosphoS301rSMTNL1 or SMTNL1 directly regulate MLCK activity toward myosin, both forms of the protein were incubated with the kinase at increasing concentrations in the presence of MgATP.

SB203580, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of p38 MAPK and other kinases, prevents this dual phosphorylation during ischemia. Studies in non-cardiac tissue have shown receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) lies upstream of p38 MAPK, is SB203580-sensitive and ischemia-responsive, and aggravates ischemic injury. We therefore examined the RIP2-p38 MAPK signaling axis in the heart. Adenovirus-driven expression of wild-type RIP2 in adult rat ventricular myocytes caused robust, SB203580-sensitive dual phosphorylation of p38 MAPK associated with activation of p38 MAPK kinases MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6. The effect of SB203580 was recapitulated by unrelated inhibitors of RIP2 or the downstream MAPK kinase kinase, TAK1. However, overexpression of wild-type, kinase-dead, caspase recruitment domain-deleted, or kinase-dead and caspase recruitment domain-deleted forms of RIP2 had no effect on the activating dual phosphorylation of p38 MAPK during simulated ischemia. Similarly, p38 MAPK activation and myocardial infarction size in response to true ischemia did not differ between hearts from wild-type and RIP2 null mice. However, both p38 MAPK activation and the contractile depression caused by the endotoxin component muramyl dipeptide were attenuated by SB203580 and in RIP2 null hearts. Although RIP2 can cause myocardial p38 MAPK dual phosphorylation in the heart under some circumstances, it is not responsible for the SB203580-sensitive pattern of activation during ischemia.

Res. 2004; 61: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar for review). Thus, in theory at least, inhibitors of p38 MAPK have therapeutic potential in ischemic heart disease. However, enthusiasm for “blanket” pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK is tempered by the facts that it is involved in innumerable biological processes (3Raman M. Chen W. Cobb M.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3100-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar), its major isoform is essential for early embryogenesis (4Tamura K. Sudo T. Senftleben U. Dadak A.M. Johnson R. Karin M. Cell. 2000; 102: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and hepatic toxicity has curtailed the development of at least three clinical trial programs (5Zhang J. Shen B. Lin A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 286-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These drawbacks have increased interest in the mechanisms controlling p38 activation in the hope they will reveal new, less crucial, therapeutic targets (5Zhang J. Shen B. Lin A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 286-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The activity of p38 MAPK is controlled by dual phosphorylation of the Thr180-Gly181-Tyr182 motif within the activation loop/lip (3Raman M. Chen W. Cobb M.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3100-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). The traditional view is that this dual phosphorylation event is achieved by upstream, dual specificity MAPK kinases or MKKs (3Raman M. Chen W. Cobb M.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3100-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 5Zhang J. Shen B. Lin A. Trends Pharmacol.

SB203580 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole), a pyridinyl imidazole, is the most widely used pharmacological inhibitor of p38 MAPK. Because it occupies the catalytic site without inhibiting upstream MKKs, it should inhibit the phosphorylation events downstream of p38 MAPK without inhibiting the dual phosphorylation of p38 MAPK itself. Nonetheless, there are numerous examples where SB203580 and other pyridinyl imidazoles diminish the dual phosphorylation of p38 MAPK during ischemia and related myocardial stresses (see Fig. 2 of Ref. 6Maulik N.

One explanation for these robust observations is that SB203580 inhibits a kinase upstream of p38 MAPK involved in its activation by transphosphorylation during ischemia. Once identified, inhibition of such a kinase may prevent p38 MAPK activation during ischemia but not under other circumstances possibly required for homeostasis. Godl et al. (16Godl K. Wissing J.

RIP2 is a likely candidate to mediate the SB203580-sensitive dual phosphorylation of p38 during ischemia because it is highly expressed in the heart (18McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), is more sensitive to SB203580 than p38α MAPK (16Godl K. Wissing J. Kurtenbach A. Habenberger P.

The principal purpose of this study was to explore whether RIP2 is responsible for the SB203580-sensitive activating dual phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and injury during myocardial ischemia. Products—Antibodies recognizing the dual phospho-Thr180/Tyr182 form of p38 MAPK (catalog no. 9211), total p38 MAPK (catalog no. 9212), and HA tag (catalog no. 2367) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies recognizing RIP2 (catalog no. ALX-804-139) and the phospho-Ser189 forms of MKK3 and MKK6 (catalog no. 7994) were from Alexis and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. SB203580 (catalog no. S8307) was obtained from Sigma, myelin basic protein (catalog no. 13-110) was from Upstate, PP2 (catalog no. 529576) was from Merck, TAK1 inhibitor (5Z-7-oxozeaenol; catalog no. NP-009245) was from Analyticon Discovery, and muramyl dipeptide (MDP) (catalog no. TLR-MDP) was from Invitrogen. Perfusion of Isolated Murine Hearts—All experiments were performed in accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office “Guidance on the Operation of Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.” Male RIP2 null (21Kobayashi K.

Hearts were rapidly isolated and placed in ice-cold modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB; 118.5 mmol of NaCl, 25.0 mmol of NaHCO3, 4.75 mmol of KCl, 1.18 mmol of KH2PO4, 1.19 mmol of MgSO4, 11.0 mmol of d-glucose, and 1.4 mmol of CaCl2). The excised heart was mounted onto a Langendorff apparatus and retrogradely perfused at a constant pressure of 80 mm Hg with KHB equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. A fluid-filled balloon inserted into the left ventricle monitored contractile function. The balloon was gradually inflated until the end diastolic pressure was between 2 and 8 mm Hg. Atrial pacing was performed at 580 beats/min with a 0.075-mm silver wire (Advent). Coronary flow was measured by timed collection of perfusate. More detailed methods and exclusion and inclusion criteria ware as described previously (22Tanno M. Bassi R. Gorog D.A. Saurin A.T. Jiang J. Heads R.J. Martin J.L. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Marber M.S.

Infarction Assessment in Isolated Murine Hearts—Following a 30-min stabilization, all hearts underwent 30 min of global ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Electrical pacing was stopped when contraction ceased during ischemia and was restarted 30 min into reperfusion. After 2 h of reperfusion, hearts were perfused for 1 min with 5 ml of 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride in phosphate-buffered saline and then placed in an identical solution at 37 °C for 10 min. The atria were removed, and the hearts were blotted dry, weighed, and stored at –20 °C for up to 1 week. Hearts were then thawed, placed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 1 min, and set in 5% agarose. The agarose heart blocks were sectioned from apex to base in 0.75-mm slices using a Vibratome (Agar Scientific). After sectioning, slices were placed overnight in 10% formaldehyde at room temperature before transferring to phosphate-buffered saline for an additional day at 4 °C. Sections were then compressed between glass plates (0.75 mm apart) and scanned (Epson Model G850A). After magnification, planimetry was carried out using image analysis software (Adobe Photoshop 7.0), and the surface areas of the whole and triphenyltetrazolium chloride-negative myocardium were transformed to volume by multiplication with tissue thickness. Within each heart, after the summation of individual slices, triphenyltetrazolium chloride-negative infarction volume was expressed as a percentage of heart volume. All analyses of infarct size were done by an investigator who was blinded with regard to the group assignments. Adult Rat Ventricular Myocyte (ARVM) Culture—ARVMs were isolated as described previously (23Bellahcene M. Jacquet S. Cao X.B. Tanno M. Haworth R.S. Layland J. Kabir A.M. Gaestel M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Shah A.M. Avkiran M. Marber M.S. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2006; 48: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and washed with M199 medium with added penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 IU/ml). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 100 × g for 2 min to pellet the myocytes, which were then resuspended in complete M199 medium (M199 medium with added penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 IU/ml), l-carnitine (2 mm), creatine (5 mm), and taurine (5 mm)) and placed in laminin-coated 6-well plates prior to incubation in 5% CO2/room air at 37 °C. After 1 h, the medium was aspirated, leaving only adherent cells, and fresh prewarmed complete M199 medium was added with specified adenoviral vectors. Adenoviral Transfection of ARVMs—Adenoviruses encoding HA-tagged forms of wild-type RIP2 (WT-RIP2), kinase-dead RIP2 (DN-RIP2; K47R), CARD-deleted RIP2 (DC-CARD; residues 1–353), and kinase-dead + CARD-deleted RIP2 (DN/DC-RIP2) were as described previously (24Eickhoff J. Hanke M. Stein-Gerlach M. Kiang T.P. Herzberger K. Habenberger P. Muller S. Klebl B. Marschall M. Stamminger T. Cotten M. J. Biol.

Cells were exposed to virus for 1 h prior to washing and incubated in virus-free complete M199 medium for 24 h. Simulated Ischemia Protocol—Simulated ischemia was induced by exposing ARVMs for the specified duration to modified KHB (137 mm NaCl, 3.8 mm KCl, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl2, and 4.0 mm HEPES) with 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose, 20 mm sodium lactate, and 1 mm sodium dithionite at pH 6.5 (25Punn A. Mockridge J.W. Farooqui S. Marber M.S. Heads R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). When specified, cells were exposed to 0.1 μm SB203580 for 60 min prior to and during simulated ischemia. Following simulated ischemia, the buffer was removed, and ARVMs were quickly frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. RIP2 Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—ARVMs were infected with HA-WT-RIP2 adenovirus; exposed 24 h later, when indicated, to SB203580 at 0.1 μm for 1 h prior to washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were lysed in buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and after centrifugation to clear the sample, the supernatant was collected, and anti-HA antibody was added prior to overnight agitation at 4 °C. The RIP2-antibody complex was pulled down using protein G beads coupled to agarose. After extensive washes, the pellet was resuspended in kinase buffer with the myelin basic protein as a substrate, [32P]ATP (5 μCi/assay), and 0.1 μm SB203580 when specified, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The incorporation of 32P in myelin basic protein was measured by autoradiography after separation on a 12% acrylamide gel. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—ARVMs and hearts were homogenized and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer as described previously (22Tanno M. Bassi R. Gorog D.A.

Proteins were separated on 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels; transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were blocked for 2 h with 5% nonfat milk plus 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Triton; and probed overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody. After washing and exposure for 2 h at room temperature to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, antibody-antigen complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Data sets were analyzed by one-way (Figs. 5B, 6C, and 7B) or two-way (Figs. 5A; 6, A and B; and 7A) analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.FIGURE 6Influence of RIP2 on sensitivity to myocardial infarction.

Hanke M. Stein-Gerlach M. Kiang T.P. Herzberger K. Habenberger P. Muller S. Klebl B. Marschall M. Stamminger T. Cotten M. J. Biol.

WT-RIP2 was able to induce a robust activation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 1A), but a similar level of ectopic expression of DN/DC-RIP2 caused no activation. Similar results were obtained in other cells, including embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 (Fig. 1B) and adult rat ventricular fibroblasts (data not shown). RIP2 Kinase Activity and p38 MAPK Activation by RIP2 Are Sensitive to Pharmacological Inhibition by SB203580 and PP2—Godl et al. (16Godl K. Wissing J. Kurtenbach A. Habenberger P. Blencke S. Gutbrod H. Salassidis K. Stein-Gerlach M. Missio A. Cotten M. Daub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15434-15439Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) reported that RIP2 is exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by SB203580. To document the sensitivity of RIP2 to inhibition by SB203580, we performed a kinase assay on WT-RIP2 expressed in ARVMs, followed by immunoprecipitation using the HA tag. The presence of 0.1 μm SB203580 in the kinase buffer largely prevented the incorporation of 32P into myelin basic protein (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the inhibition of RIP2 kinase activity by SB203580 diminishes endogenous p38 MAPK dual phosphorylation, we performed a dose-response study on ARVMs expressing WT-RIP2 or DN/DC-RIP2 (Fig. 2B). As expected, SB203580 prevented RIP2-induced p38 MAPK activation. It is important to note that SB203580 inhibited p38 MAPK phosphorylation at a concentration 2 orders of magnitude lower than that commonly used to inhibit p38 MAPK catalytic activity in intact cells (10 μm). At this concentration, it is unlikely that our observation is the result of the inhibition of another mechanism of SB203580-sensitive p38 dual phosphorylation, viz. p38 autophosphorylation (26Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). However, to rule out this possibility, we exposed transfected ARVMs to PP2, which inhibits RIP2 and Src kinase activity (20Windheim M. Lang C. Peggie M. Plater L.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and similarly prevented p38 activation by RIP2 (Fig. 2C). In conclusion, these results suggest that RIP2 lies upstream of p38 MAPK in an SB203580- and PP2-sensitive manner. Characterization of the Domains of RIP2 Responsible for p38 MAPK Activation—RIP2 was originally described as a serine/threonine kinase implicated in NF-κB activation and apoptosis (27Lu C. Wang A.

RIP2 is composed of an N-terminal kinase domain followed by an intermediate region and a C-terminal CARD. The physiological role of the RIP2 kinase domain in isolation is uncertain because autophosphorylation of Ser176 on RIP2 (28Dorsch M. Wang A. Cheng H. Lu C. Bielecki A. Charron K. Clauser K. Ren H. Polakiewicz R.D. Parsons T. Li P. Ocain T. Xu Y. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) is the only substrate yet identified, and RIP2 has been proposed to function primarily as a scaffolding protein (27Lu C. Wang A. Dorsch M. Tian J. Nagashima K. Coyle A.J. Jaffee B. Ocain T.D. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16278-16283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to characterize the individual roles of the CARD and kinase domain in the activation of p38 MAPK in ARVMs by using our previously described adenoviral constructs lacking kinase activity (DN-RIP2) or CARD (DC-RIP2) as well as kinase activity together with CARD (DN/DC-RIP2) (Fig. 3A) (24Eickhoff J. Hanke M. Stein-Gerlach M. Kiang T.P. Herzberger K. Habenberger P. Muller S. Klebl B. Marschall M. Stamminger T. Cotten M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9642-9652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Expression of the kinase-dead RIP2 form resulted in robust p38 MAPK dual phosphorylation that appears similar to that seen with WT-RIP2, suggesting that kinase activity is not the major contributor. This was confirmed by deletion of CARD alone (DC-RIP2), which diminished p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Surprisingly, this was further diminished in DN/DC-RIP2-expressing cells, suggesting that in the absence of CARD, kinase activity contributes to p38 MAPK dual phosphorylation, but in the presence of CARD, it has a minor role. To better understand the mechanisms responsible for this pattern of p38 MAPK dual phosphorylation, we examined the activating phosphorylations within the archetypal p38 MAPK upstream kinases TAK1 (29Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kajino T. Ono K. Ohtomo T. Matsumoto M. Shiina M. Mihara M. Tsuchiya M. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18485-18490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and MKK (3Raman M. Chen W. Cobb M.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3100-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether TAK1 plays a role in the activation of p38 MAPK by RIP2, we treated cells with a TAK1 inhibitor, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (Fig. 3B) (29Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kajino T. Ono K. Ohtomo T. Matsumoto M. Shiina M. Mihara M. Tsuchiya M. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18485-18490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In the presence of the TAK1 inhibitor, there was markedly reduced activation of p38 MAPK by RIP2, indicating that RIP2 is acting through TAK1, confirming similar results previously obtained in HEK293 cells (20Windheim M. Lang C. Peggie M. Plater L.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27Lu C. Wang A. Dorsch M. Tian J. Nagashima K. Coyle A.J. Jaffee B. Ocain T.D. Xu Y.

Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18485-18490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Then we further characterized the signaling pathway leading to the activation of p38 MAPK by RIP2 by studying the possible role of the MKK proteins (Fig. 3C). When cells express WT-RIP2, there is robust activation of MKK6 and of MKK3 to a lesser extent. Interestingly, by comparing the individual mutants, it seems likely that RIP2 kinase activity is responsible for the activation of MKK6 and MKK3 (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 3C) and that CARD is responsible for the activation of MKK4 (compare lanes 2 and 4). We confirmed the role of the MKKs in the RIP2 pathway by exposing the cells to the RIP2 inhibitor SB203580 at 0.1 μm, and as expected, we observed decreased MKK6 and MKK4 activation (Fig. 3C). However, surprisingly, the effect of pharmacological inhibition with SB203580 on p38 MAPK dual phosphorylation was greater than the effect of the absence of kinase activity. Moreover, SB203580 haf a marked added effect on p38 MAPK dual phosphorylation caused by exposure to kinase-dead RIP2, confirming an action independent of kinase inhibition. The mechanisms that underlie this observation are worthy of further exploration and include SB203580 inhibiting endogenous RIP2, binding to RIP2, and interfering with downstream kinase-independent signaling and/or inhibiting other RIP2-dependent kinase signals. In summary, RIP2 overexpression in ARVMs results in robust and SB203580-sensitive dual phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. This pattern is identical to that seen during myocardial ischemia (6Maulik N.

Computational approaches to investigation of enzymatic catalysis rely on the ability to obtain a proper initial structure for the system under study. Three-dimensional structures are best determined by experimental methods such as x-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, or even electron microscopy (1Chiu W. Baker M. Jiang W. Dougherty M. Schmid M. Structure. 2005; 13: 363-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, experimental methods cannot always be applied. Many proteins are too large for NMR analysis and cannot be expressed or purified in an amount substantial enough to be crystallized for x-ray diffraction; consequently, there are no corresponding three-dimensional structures for the majority of protein sequences. In such cases prediction of the protein structure by computational methods can frequently result in a useful model. However, the application of a comparative model depends on its accuracy. A strong predictor is the sequence identity between the target and the known protein structure used as a template; there is a broad application spectrum based on this identity. The high end of the accuracy spectrum corresponds to models based on 50% identity or more; the average accuracy of these models is about 1 Å root mean square for the main-chain atoms, which is comparable with that of low resolution x-ray structures (2Baker D. Sali A. Science. 2001; 294: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Mammalian histidine decarboxylase (HDC 4The abbreviations used are: HDC, histidine decarboxylase; rHDC, rat HDC; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; DDC, DOPA decarboxylase; pDDC, pig DDC; AADC, l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase; rAADC, rat AADC; QM, quantum mechanics; MM, molecular mechanics; PMF, potentials of mean force; NVT, constant number of particles, volume, and temperature. 4The abbreviations used are: HDC, histidine decarboxylase; rHDC, rat HDC; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; DDC, DOPA decarboxylase; pDDC, pig DDC; AADC, l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase; rAADC, rat AADC; QM, quantum mechanics; MM, molecular mechanics; PMF, potentials of mean force; NVT, constant number of particles, volume, and temperature.; EC 4.1.1.22) is one of the enzymes for which there is no experimentally solved structure due to its instability in vivo, in crude extracts, and in purified solutions (3Moya-García A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 13438-13446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that synthesizes histamine by decarboxylation of histidine. The importance of this enzyme is obvious considering that the biogenic amine histamine (2-(4-imidazolyl)ethylamine) is a multifunctional intercellular mediator involved in many different physiological responses in animals (hematopoiesis, gastric secretion, neurotransmission) (5Haas H. Panula P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 6Ohtsu H. et al.FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 7Schneider E.

It is also related to many pathological processes (gastric ulcer, allergy and many other inflammatory diseases, bone lost, tumor progression, learning deficiency, and epilepsy, etc.) (9Fitzpatrick L.

Thus, the control of its synthesis should be interesting for therapy against these pathologies that affect a high population rate at any stage of their lives. Nevertheless, nowadays, antihistamine pharmacology is based on agonists and antagonists of the histamine reception in target cells but not on the development of modulators of its synthesis. This is mainly due to the lack of information about the proper targets for intervention at the level of its synthesis in the different histamine-producing cell types (3Moya-García A. Medina M. Sánchez-Jiménez F. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Gram-positive bacteria express a non-homologous pyruvoyl-dependent HDC, but Enterobacteria express a PLP-dependent HDC that is evolutionary related to the mammalian enzyme (14Kamath A. Vaaler G. Snell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9432-9437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides, several mammalian cell types (mainly neurons) also express a highly homologous PLP-dependent enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis of several neurotransmitters, named DOPA decarboxylase or l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (DDC/AADC) (15Sandmeier E. Hale T. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 16Burkhard P. Dominici P. Borri-Voltattorni C. Jansonius J. Malashkevich V. Nat. Struct.

According to these facts, it has been difficult to develop specific modulators of mammalian histidine decarboxylase activity. In actuality, synthetic substrate analogs such as fluoromethylhistidine and histidine methyl ester can inhibit both the Gram-negative and the mammalian HDC (18Rodríguez-Caso C. Rodríguez-Agudo D. Moya-García A. Fajardo I. Medina M. Subramaniam V. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4376-4387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); other inhibitors, such as epigalocathequine-3-gallate, have been described as inhibitors of both mammalian HDC and DDC/AADC (19Rodríguez-Caso C. Rodríguez-Agudo D. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Medina M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As a consequence, a deeper structural characterization of the mammalian enzyme is needed to locate the best targets for selective intervention. The first three-dimensional model of a mammalian enzyme (rat HDC (rHDC)) was obtained in 2003 based on a pig DOPA decarboxylase (pDDC) structure as the template (sequence identity of 52%) (18Rodríguez-Caso C. Rodríguez-Agudo D. Moya-García A. Fajardo I. Medina M. Subramaniam V. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4376-4387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This structure was then validated with experimental results that were obtained from more than 25 direct mutants (20Fleming J. Fajardo I. Langlois M. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Wang T. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Fleming J. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Moya-García A. Langlois M. Wang T. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 253-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) so that the functional data on the enzyme fit well with the proposed model of the enzyme (3Moya-García A. Medina M. Sánchez-Jiménez F. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The agreement between our proposed rHDC structure and the experimental data available has led us to perform a detailed computational study aimed to unravel special topics of the catalytic mechanism, namely the location of the cofactor-substrate adduct in the active site as well as its correct conformation for decarboxylation. Such an effort offers additional and definitive validation of our model as a reliable representation of the structure of mammalian histidine decarboxylase and contributes to extending the scope of computational focus on enzyme catalysis. Catalysis by PLP-dependent enzymes has been extensively reviewed (23Hayashi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 24Eliot A. Kirsch J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The PLP-dependent decarboxylase catalytic cycle begins with the cofactor covalently bound to the ∈-amino group of a specific and conserved Lys residue (Lys-308 in rHDC) in a Schiff base known as internal aldimine. After substrate binding, the external aldimine intermediate (PLP-His) is formed via a reversible transaldimination process; then, decarboxylation occurs, histamine is released from the catalytic site, and the enzyme recovers the internal aldimine state (Fig. 1). Any of these processes may be the rate-limiting step of the entire reaction rate. In fact, kcat of the mammalian enzyme is extremely low (lower than 0.1 s-1), in contrast to those higher values (2–3 orders of magnitude) reported for both homologous enzymes, mammalian DDC/AADCs, and HDC from Enterobacteria (25Tanase S. Guirard B. Snell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6738-6746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Olmo M. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Medina M. Hayashi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As revealed by structure/function relationship studies carried out in our and other laboratories, both mammalian HDCs and DDC/AADCs are described as homodimeric enzymes (18Rodríguez-Caso C. Rodríguez-Agudo D. Moya-García A. Fajardo I. Medina M. Subramaniam V. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4376-4387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Rodríguez-Caso C.

J. 2004; 379: 253-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their active sites must be similar and involve residues of both monomers. PLP binding residues are mainly located in one of them, but both monomers contribute to the substrate binding site (16Burkhard P. Dominici P. Borri-Voltattorni C. Jansonius J. Malashkevich V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 963-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 18Rodríguez-Caso C. Rodríguez-Agudo D. Moya-García A. Fajardo I. Medina M. Subramaniam V. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Eur. J.

J. 2004; 379: 253-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By means of different biophysical techniques (circular dichroism, electrophoresis under semidenaturing conditions, and gel filtration chromatography), it was detected that local conformational changes occur after histidine binding and then are transmitted to the global conformation of the mammalian histidine decarboxylase (18Rodríguez-Caso C. Rodríguez-Agudo D. Moya-García A. Fajardo I. Medina M. Subramaniam V. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4376-4387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These facts have not been observed in other homologous enzymes, at least in such extent (21Fleming J. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Moya-García A. Langlois M. Wang T. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 253-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Olmo M. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Medina M. Hayashi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Hayashi H.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1802-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Transaldimination leads to formation of the external aldimine, whereas the conserved lysine residue is released. This external aldimine can exist in different prototropic forms, although the predominant form seems to be that which presents the pyridine and the amide nitrogen atoms as protonated, whereas the 3′-hydroxyl group is deprotonated (29Auld D.S. Bruice T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 2098-2106Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2). There are two possible ways of histidine binding to PLP that lead to two different conformations for the external aldimine. We have named them as conformation 1, for the conformation in which the side chain of the substrate points toward the re face of the imino sp2 center (i.e. opposite to the PLP-binding lysine), and conformation 2, for that in which the substrate points toward the si face of the cofactor. Kern et al. (30Kern A.D. Oliveira M.A. Coffino P. Hackert M.L. Structure. 1999; 7: 567-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) asserted that the PLP-His position in the group II amino acid decarboxylase folding family corresponds to the conformation 1. When the structure of pDDC was solved, a conformation similar to conformation 2 was observed for the PLP-carbiDOPA adduct in the catalytic site (16Burkhard P. Dominici P. Borri-Voltattorni C. Jansonius J. Malashkevich V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 963-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In this work we carry out a theoretical analysis of external aldimine decarboxylation in the active site of rHDC. The structure of the enzyme, obtained from homology models, is used to explore the catalytic properties of the enzyme by means of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations. The first part of the study was devoted to investigation of an appropriate model of the external aldimine in the active site. We investigated different possible structures for this external aldimine, concluding that conformation 1 seems to be more appropriate for the external aldimine considered in this case. In the second part, we simulated the decarboxylation reaction in the active site and compared it to the uncatalyzed process in water. A homology model for the structure of rat histidine decarboxylase reported by the authors (18Rodríguez-Caso C. Rodríguez-Agudo D. Moya-García A. Fajardo I. Medina M. Subramaniam V. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4376-4387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and validated by directed mutagenesis (3Moya-García A. Medina M. Sánchez-Jiménez F. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Fleming J. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Moya-García A. Langlois M. Wang T. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 253-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to manually fit the Schiff base formed by the histidine substrate and the cofactor PLP into the active cleft in two different ways; this was done to obtain the two starting conformations of the external aldimine. Calculations were performed by means of a QM/MM computational scheme (31Warshel A. Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 227-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3620) Google Scholar, 32Roca M. Moliner V.

Chem. 2002; 53: 467-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) using the CHARMM 27 package (34MacKerell Jr., A.D. et al.J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11621) Google Scholar). The external aldimine was chosen as the QM subsystem (described using the AM1 hamiltonian) (35Dewar M. Zoebisch E. Healy E. Stewart J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3902-3909Crossref Scopus (15025) Google Scholar), whereas the MM subsystem was composed of both protein residues and water molecules. To achieve a reasonable agreement between performance and calculation time for this large protein (15,054 atoms), a simulation protocol was followed (36Poulsen T. García-Viloca M. Truhlar D. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 9567-9578Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 37Ferrer S. Ruiz-Pernía J. Tuñón I. Moliner V. García-Viloca M. González-Lafont A. Lluch J.M. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2005; 1: 750-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). First, the coordinates of the hydrogen atoms of the protein were determined using the HBUILD program of the CHARMM package, where all the ionizable groups were set to their normal ionization state at pH 7. Then, the protein was relaxed using a potential restraining scheme with a low force constant (25 kcal·mol-1Å-2) applied only on the peptidic backbone. Finally, the optimized protein was solvated with a 24-Å radius sphere of TIP3P water molecules using atom C4 of the substrate (see Fig. 2 for atom numbering) as the geometrical center of the system. Water molecules that were within a distance of 2.5 Å of any non-hydrogen atom were removed. The resulting system was resolvated four more times using different relative orientations between the protein and the water sphere to ensure good solvation of the system. Then, water positions were optimized using the Adopted Basis Newton-Raphson (ABNR) algorithm followed by optimization of that part of the system included in the sphere of 24 Å around C4. Finally, a molecular dynamics simulation of the water molecules (5 ps) was carried out to relax energetically unfavorable contacts, and the 3-fold cycle of superposition, deletion, and rotation was then repeated to fill in additional cavities generated during the dynamic simulation. Thus, the final model has 16,352 atoms; 15,054 of them are atoms from the protein, 41 from the cofactor-substrate adduct, and 1,257 atoms are from the water molecules. The residues lying outside of this 24 Å sphere were kept fixed for subsequent calculations, whereas the residues inside the 20-Å sphere from C4 were totally free. A buffer zone was described for the residues and water molecules in the zone between 20 and 24 Å. The movement of the atoms in this buffer region was restrained following a protocol detailed in Poulsen et al. (36Poulsen T. García-Viloca M. Truhlar D. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 9567-9578Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, a switched cut-off radius from 12 to 13.5 Å was used for all interactions. The final structure was first heated to 310 K for 30 ps and then equilibrated using hybrid QM/MM Langevin-Verlet molecular dynamics (NVT) over 500 ps. We also studied the decarboxylation step in solution using the same QM/MM methodology. In this case the aldimine (QM subsystem) was placed in a cavity deleted from a 55.8-Å cubic box of water molecules, described using the classical TIP3P potential (a total of 5804 water molecules). For all calculations performed in water, periodic boundary conditions were applied, making use of the same switched cut-off radius. The conformational changes and decarboxylation reactions were studied through computation of the corresponding potentials of mean force (PMFs) using the canonical ensemble (NVT). A PMF was traced using the χ dihedral angle (see Fig. 2) as the distinguished coordinate to investigate the relative orientation of the carboxylate group and the pyridine ring. A total of 12 simulation windows were run to cover coordinate values from -80 to -180 degrees for this χ transition. Each window was started from the final conformation of the previous window and consisted of 10 ps of equilibration and 80 ps of production using a time step of 1 fs. Changes in the selected reaction coordinate were restrained using an umbrella potential with a force constant of 1.2 kcal·mol-1degree-2 and an additional biasing potential (39Torrie G.M. Valleau J.P. J. Comp. Phys. 1977; 23: 187-199Crossref Scopus (4174) Google Scholar). A potential of mean force was also computed using the distance between CA and C (see Fig. 2) as the reaction coordinate. In this case we ran 17 windows to cover a reaction coordinate range from 1.4 to 3.0 Å. Each consecutive window consisted of 10 ps of production at 310 K, with a time step of 1 fs and a force constant of 500 kcal·mol-1Å-2. In both cases, the reference temperature was 310 K. The different values of the variable sampled during the simulations were then pieced together by means of the weighted histogram analysis method (38Gao J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 7796-7797Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to construct the distribution functions from which the PMFs were derived. Finally, the same chemical step was studied in water solution. The reaction coordinate, defined also as the distance between the CA and C atoms, was sampled along a total of 65 windows. Langevin-Verlet NVT molecular dynamics were applied to each window, running for a total of 10 ps for relaxation followed by 15 ps for production. The umbrella constant applied on each particular value of the reaction coordinate was 600 kcal·mol-1·Å-2, and the temperature of the bath was 310 K. As before, weighted histogram analysis method was used to render the PMF. External Aldimine Conformation—The external aldimine is formed in the pDDC active site from PLP and the inhibitor carbiDOPA, the substrate analog pointed toward the si face of the cofactor in a conformation similar to conformation 2 in Fig. 3 (16Burkhard P. Dominici P. Borri-Voltattorni C. Jansonius J. Malashkevich V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 963-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). An interesting discussion has been reported on the suitability of binding the substrate to PLP toward the re or si face (40Matsuda N. Hayashi H. Miyatake S. Kuroiwa T. Kagamiyama H.J. J. Biochem. 2004; 135: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Matsuda et al. (40Matsuda N. Hayashi H. Miyatake S. Kuroiwa T. Kagamiyama H.J. J. Biochem. 2004; 135: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) suggest that because the inhibitor carbiDOPA has an α-hydrazino group with an extra nitrogen atom (compared with the α-amino group of DOPA and His), the PLP-carbiDOPA complex is expected to adopt a significantly different conformation from that of PLP-DOPA and, consequently, the PLP-His in the HDC active site. This issue has important consequences for the relative orientation of the substrate with respect to the enzyme. In the conformation 2, the side chain of the substrate points toward the interior of the protein, whereas in the conformation 1 it points outwards the enzyme (see Fig. 3, panels C and D). To solve this question, we built both conformations for the external aldimine complex. The two conformations of the external aldimine were fully minimized in the active site using the QM/MM hybrid potential described in the previous section. After geometry optimization, we obtained the conformations presented in Fig. 3. It is important to note that conformation 2 presents a too-short distance between two negatively charged groups of the molecule; that is, the phosphate and the carboxylate groups. This high energy conformation of the external aldimine is then very unlikely to be appropriate for describing the product of the transaldimination. To confirm this point, the full system (cofactor-substrate complex, protein, and water molecules) was heated to 310 K and then 450 ps of NVT/MD simulation were run for each of the two conformations. Fig. 4 displays the time evolution of some key distances for both cases; that is, the distance between the carbon atom of the carboxylate group and the phosphorous atom of the phosphate group (C-P), the distance between the imino nitrogen atom and the negatively charged O3 atom (N-O3), and the CA-C bond length. As can be observed, the conformation 2 evolves through spontaneous decarboxylation after 100 ps. The only way found in this conformation for diminishing the electrostatic repulsion between the phosphate and carboxylate groups is to lengthen the CA-C distance, leading to decarboxylation of the transaldimination product. On the other hand, the conformation 1 remains stable during the simulation. Another noticeable difference between the two conformations is that the first form retains a strong and biologically relevant intramolecular hydrogen bond between the imino nitrogen and the O3 atom (23Hayashi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (the O3-N distance fluctuates around 2.2 Å), whereas in the other form, the N atom forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule. We can, thus, consider that the conformation 2 does not properly represent the external aldimine, whereas the first conformation may be considered as a realistic model in agreement with the proposal of Matsuda et al. (40Matsuda N. Hayashi H. Miyatake S. Kuroiwa T. Kagamiyama H.J. J. Biochem. 2004; 135: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); therefore, subsequent studies were performed on this conformation. Active Site Description—Once the conformation of the external aldimine in the active site seemed to be well established, we could concentrate on the most important interactions observed with the active site residues. We monitored distances between heteroatoms of PLP-His and those of the closest-neighbor amino acids to localize important hydrogen bonds. Fig. 5 shows the position of some important residues of the active site interacting with the external aldimine in the conformation 1. Residues located less than 5 Å from the PLP moiety are (A and B are used to distinguish both monomers) V100A, T152A, V153A, S154A, H197A, S199A, K202A, T247A, T250A, T251A, D276A, K308A, F314A, P355B, and L356B; those closer to the substrate moiety are Y83A, Y84A, I439A, F331B, M350B, H351B, and I354B. There is experimental evidence for an essential role in mammalian HDC activity for those residues highlighted in italics (21Fleming J. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Moya-García A. Langlois M. Wang T. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 253-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active site is located in the monomer-monomer interface but is mainly composed of residues from one monomer; as in pDDC (16Burkhard P. Dominici P. Borri-Voltattorni C. Jansonius J. Malashkevich V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 963-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), residues of the opposite monomer participating in the active site are mainly hydrophobic and noteworthy, and there are a number of water molecules participating in direct interactions with both the cofactor and substrate. There are several nonpolar residues that are meant to increase the hydrophobicity of the active site to facilitate the introduction of an aromatic substrate such as histidine. This is also a common feature of aromatic amino acid decarboxylases (23Hayashi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that there are a number of water molecules (only one is shown in the figure) participating in direct interactions with both the cofactor and the substrate. Lys-308 is the residue that binds PLP covalently to form the internal aldimine. This residue is shifted during transaldimination and is responsible for product release (23Hayashi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the external aldimine state, this lysine together with Lys-202 interacts with the phosphate group of PLP, providing extra binding energy to the adduct. Lys-202 can establish this interaction after a conformational change of its side chain. The charge-charge interactions established between these two lysine residues and the phosphate group of PLP play a very important role in providing a favorable environment for the external aldimine. The averaged distances from the N∈ atoms of lysine residues to the closest oxygen atoms of the phosphate groups are 2.73 and 3.27 Å for Lys-308 and Lys-202, respectively. His-197, another highly conserved residue, is stacked parallel to the cofactor pyridine ring. Its anal"

Upon v-H-Ras overexpression, normal cells undergo senescence through several cellular processes, including activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. Interestingly, the <i>E1a</i> gene from adenovirus 5 has been shown to rescue cells from senescence by a yet unknown mechanism. We investigated whether E1a was able to interfere with the ERK1/2 signaling pathway to rescue cells from v-H-Ras-mediated senescence. Our results show that, E1a overexpression blocks v-H-Ras-mediated ERK1/2 activation by two different and concomitant mechanisms. E1a through its ability to interfere with PKB/Akt activation induces the down-regulation of the PEA15 protein, an ERK1/2 nuclear export factor, leading to nuclear accumulation of ERK1/2. In addition to this, we show that E1a increases the expression of the inducible ERK1/2 nuclear phosphatases (MAPK phosphatases) MKP1/DUSP1 and DUSP5, which leads to ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. We confirmed our observations in the human normal diploid fibroblasts IMR90, in which we could also show that an E1a mutant, unable to bind retinoblastoma protein (pRb), cannot rescue cells from v-H-Ras-induced senescence. In conclusion, E1a is able to rescue from Ras-induced senescence by affecting ERK1/2 localization and phosphorylation."

In this work, we have investigated the effect of a physiological electron donor to cytochrome cd1, the copper protein pseudoazurin, on the mechanism of nitrite reduction by the enzyme.

Pseudoazurin catalyzed this effect even when present at only one-tenth the stoichiometry of cytochrome cd1. In contrast, redox-inert zinc pseudoazurin did not affect cd1-X, indicating a crucial role for electron movement between monomers or individual enzyme dimers rather than simply a protein-protein interaction. Furthermore, formation of cd1-X was, remarkably, accelerated by the presence of pseudoazurin, such that it occurred at a rate consistent with cd1-X being an intermediate in the catalytic cycle.

Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The c heme is located in the N-terminal region of the enzyme, which is predominantly α-helical (with a fold similar to that of mitochondrial cytochrome c). As in the vast majority of c-type cytochromes (4Allen J.W.A. Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

In cytochromes cd1, the c heme is the site of electron acceptance from the external donor proteins (6Silvestrini M.C. Cutruzzolè F. D'Alessandro R. Brunori M. Fochesato N. Zennaro E. Biochem.

The d1 heme is a dioxoisobacteriochlorin (a four-electron reduced porphyrin relative to “normal” b heme and with other variant features) (9Wu W. Chang C.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 3149-3150Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and is unique to this class of enzyme. It is noncovalently bound to the polypeptide chain and is at the active site (10Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar); the d1 heme binding domain has an eight-bladed β-propeller structure. Nitrite (NO2−) binds via its nitrogen atom to the iron of the d1 heme, where it is reduced by one electron to form nitric oxide (10Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J.

In addition to reduction of nitrite to NO, cytochrome cd1 is capable of catalyzing the two-electron reduction of hydroxylamine to ammonia and the four-electron reduction of oxygen to water. The enzyme was long thought to be an oxidase; however, it is now widely accepted that its physiological role is the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide during denitrification (12Richter C.D.

The crystal structure of oxidized P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1“as isolated” revealed that the c heme is axially ligated by histidines 69 and 17 and that the d1 heme iron is coordinated by histidine 200 and tyrosine 25 (3Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The distal tyrosine ligand to the d1 heme is provided by the c heme domain of the protein and is connected to the c heme distal ligand, His-17, by a short loop. Upon reduction of the enzyme, a remarkable switch in heme coordinations occurs. His-17 is replaced by Met-106 as a ligand to the c heme, resulting in His/Met coordination, and Tyr-25 dissociates from the d1 heme, leaving the iron pentacoordinate and able to bind substrate (10Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The oxidized “as isolated” state of the enzyme is catalytically inert, but the enzyme can be activated by reduction (12Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Koppenhöfer A. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J.

When reduced enzyme is reoxidized, the oxidized form generated (which retains His/Met c heme coordination) is catalytically active in the presence of electron donor and substrate but, in their absence, reverts slowly (over a few min) to the inactive “as isolated” conformation (which has His/His-coordinated c heme) (16Allen J.W.A.

There remain many mechanistic uncertainties for cytochrome cd1, prominent among which is the mode of release of nitric oxide from the d1 heme.

This may be through a protein-protein interaction, or it may be as a result of the electron donation itself. To test these possibilities, we have mixed fully reduced cytochrome cd1 plus potassium nitrite, in the absence of excess reductant, with fully oxidized pseudoazurin (in the absence of excess oxidant) and also with pseudoazurin from which the normal copper had been extracted and replaced with zinc. The results of these experiments are presented here, and implications for the physiological mechanism of nitric oxide dissociation from cytochrome cd1 are discussed. Preparation of Cytochrome cd1—P. pantotrophus was grown in anaerobic conditions at 37 °C. Cytochrome cd1 was purified from the periplasm of the cells according to the method of Moir et al. (19Moir J.W.B. Baratta D. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), as modified by Koppenhöfer et al. (20Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzyme was determined by the Rz value (A406/A280), and all cytochrome cd1 used in this work had an Rz > 1.25. The concentration of the enzyme was determined at 406 nm for the oxidized enzyme and 418 nm for the reduced, using the respective extinction coefficients of 142.5 mm-1 cm-1 (21Kobayashi K. Koppenhöfer A. Ferguson S.J. Tagawa S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and 161.5 mm-1 cm-1 (20Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J.

These extinction coefficients refer to the concentration of the enzyme monomer; throughout this work, the enzyme concentration will be given as monomer concentration. Fully reduced cytochrome cd1, which has oxidase activity (20Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was produced by reduction with sodium dithionite in an anaerobic glove box (<2 ppm of O2; Faircrest Ltd.); the excess reductant was removed by passing the enzyme down a desalting column packed with P6-DG resin (Bio-Rad) and equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer. Preparation of Pseudoazurin—Pseudoazurin was purified according to the method of Moir et al. (19Moir J.W.B. Baratta D. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J.

Cells were grown aerobically for 16 h on 2× TY medium containing 2 mm CuSO4 and 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin. To ensure that the pure pseudoazurin was fully oxidized for use in kinetics experiments, a small excess of potassium ferricyanide was added. The excess oxidant was separated from the protein using a desalting column packed with P6-DG resin (Bio-Rad). Preparation of Zinc Pseudoazurin—Apopseudoazurin was prepared essentially according to the method previously described (23Capaldi A.P. Ferguson S.J. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The apopseudoazurin was washed by passing down a desalting column packed with P6-DG resin and equilibrated in water. Buffering apopseudoazurin in 50 mm potassium phosphate solution was found to cause protein precipitation. The apopseudoazurin was incubated with 20 mm ZnCl2 for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with water as above. The concentration of zinc pseudoazurin, which is colorless, was estimated from its predicted extinction coefficient at 280 nm calculated using the program ProtParam (available on the World Wide Web). Characterization of Zinc Pseudoazurin—Zinc pseudoazurin, like reduced copper pseudoazurin, is colorless; therefore, it was not possible to verify the presence of zinc holopseudoazurin by any characteristic absorbance in the visible region of the spectrum. However, a comparison of the UV region of the spectrum with that of copper holopseudoazurin indicated the same absorbance pattern (data not shown). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry indicated that the zinc pseudoazurin was of the expected molecular weight and had not been degraded during the preparation process, although the metal dissociates from the polypeptide in this experiment. The addition of potassium ferricyanide, in an attempt to oxidize any residual copper bound to the protein, did not cause any increase in absorbance at 590 nm, indicating that the process of making the zinc pseudoazurin had not merely yielded reduced copper pseudoazurin. The addition of copper to the zinc pseudoazurin, followed by oxidation with potassium ferricyanide, did not result in any increase in absorbance at 590 nm, indicating that apopseudoazurin was not present; apopseudoazurin takes up copper to reform holopseudoazurin, which absorbs maximally at 590 nm in the oxidized state (19Moir J.W.B. Baratta D. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The circular dichroism spectrum of the zinc pseudoazurin was compared with that of copper pseudoazurin (data not shown). The spectrum of copper pseudoazurin was as previously published (23Capaldi A.P. Ferguson S.J. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and that of the zinc pseudoazurin was very similar, although the spectrum of the latter possibly indicated the presence of a minor amount of unfolded protein, which is likely to have been produced during the process of extracting the copper. The zinc pseudoazurin was also denatured with 4 m urea; the unfolded form gave a completely different CD spectrum showing that, although there may have been a small percentage of misfolded protein present in the zinc pseudoazurin stock, the majority was not unfolded. Stopped-flow UV-visible Spectroscopy—Stopped-flow experiments were performed on a Hi-Tech SF-61 DX2 double mixing stopped-flow spectrophotometer interfaced with a CU-61 control unit (Hi-Tech Scientific). The path length of the optical cell was 10 mm, and the dead-time of the instrument was ∼2 ms. The stopped-flow unit was housed entirely within an anaerobic glove box maintained at <2 ppm O2. Unless otherwise stated, all solutions of enzyme and substrate were prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Both single and multimixing experiments were carried out, and details of these are given under “Results” and in each of the figure legends. For multimixing experiments, enzyme and substrates were prepared at 4 times the final concentration required, and in single mixing experiments, they were prepared at double the final required concentration. EPR Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were recorded using conditions similar to those previously described (18George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) on a Bruker ELEXSYS 500 spectrometer with an ER049X SuperX microwave bridge and shq cavity, fitted with an Oxford Instruments ER-900 liquid helium-cooled cryostat. Integrations of EPR signals were performed according to the method of Aasa and Vänngård (24Aasa R. Vänngård T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar). Pseudoazurin Promotes Decay of cd1-X—A stopped-flow multimixing experiment was carried out in which fully reduced P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 was mixed with 4 mm potassium nitrite to form cd1-X, which is an approximately equimolar mixture of cFe(III) d1Fe(II)-NO and cFe(II) d1Fe(II)-NO+ (18George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This mixture was allowed to age for ∼82 ms, the time scale on which George et al. (18George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported full formation of cd1-X, and was then mixed with oxidized pseudoazurin. When a stoichiometric ratio of initially oxidized pseudoazurin to d1 heme was used, the disappearance of cd1-X was lost in the dead time of the instrument (∼2 ms), and, therefore, the experiment was repeated using pseudoazurin at one-tenth the stoichiometry of enzyme monomer. Diode array spectra were collected on a logarithmic time base for 2 s after mixing with pseudoazurin (Fig. 1). The first time point after mixing with pseudoazurin, at which a peak at 632 nm is clearly visible and a significant proportion of the c heme is still reduced, as judged by the characteristic split α-band absorbance around 550 nm, is shown in boldface type. These spectral features indicate the presence of cd1-X (18George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Table 1). At later time points after mixing with pseudoazurin at one-tenth the stoichiometry of enzyme monomer, the peak at 632 nm attenuated and was red-shifted to 641 nm, with oxidation occurring at the c heme. The final species was almost completely oxidized at the c heme and had a d1 heme absorbance maximum at 641 nm (Fig. 1; Table 1). In other experiments (e.g. Fig. 2), the final product was fully oxidized at the c heme, and the presence of the residual absorbance around 550 nm in Fig. 1 is probably explained by the presence of a small amount of reduced semiapocytochrome cd1 (i.e. lacking the d1 heme) (13Timkovich R. Dhesi R. Martinkus K.J. Robinson M.K. Rea T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 215: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The most likely assignment of the final product of the reaction between pseudoazurin and cd1-X is all-ferric cytochrome cd1 with nitrite bound (i.e. cFe(III) d1Fe(III)-NO2−), as was suggested by George et al. for the product of photodissociation of cd1-X (18George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). If so, the enzyme has been oxidized relative to cd1-X, and NO has been released. The final products of photocatalyzed and pseudoazurin-dependent NO dissociation from cytochrome cd1 have essentially identical absorption spectra (Fig. 2); this was the same whether the pseudoazurin concentration was stoichiometric with d1 heme or at one-tenth the stoichiometry. Another possible assignment for the species obtained after reaction of initially oxidized pseudoazurin with cd1-X would be the all-ferric enzyme with NO bound at the d1 heme. However, this is unlikely, since the spectrum does not vary with pH in the manner that we have observed for the all-ferric NO-bound form of cytochrome cd1 (Table 1). The final product of the reaction between pseudoazurin and cd1-X at pH 7.0 had a visible absorption peak at 641 nm, and when the same experiment was repeated at pH 6.0, the peak was at 639 nm. Model spectra for both nitrite and NO bound to fully oxidized cytochrome cd1 were obtained using the Y25S variant of P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1, which, unlike the “as isolated” oxidized wild type enzyme, is fully competent for exogenous ligand binding (25Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jafferji A. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Fülöp V. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 26073-26079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The d1 heme peak in the spectrum of nitrite bound to all-ferric Y25S enzyme varied from 639 to 642 nm as the pH shifted from 6.0 to 7.0 (Table 1). However, in the spectrum of NO bound to all-ferric Y25S cytochrome cd1, the d1 heme peak varied between 632 nm at pH 6.0 and 640 nm at pH 7.0. The possibility of the final species produced by the reaction between pseudoazurin and cd1-X being ferrous d1 heme with NO bound was ruled out using EPR spectroscopy. A signal corresponding to d1Fe(II)-NO (28Johnson M.K. Thomson A.J. Walsh T.A. Barber D. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was observed in the spectrum of a sample of cd1-X reacted with pseudoazurin, but quantitation showed that it represented only ∼1% of the total d1 heme that was present.FIGURE 2Optical spectra showing the products of pseudoazurin-dependent (dashed line) versus photocatalyzed (solid line) dissociation of the complex formed on mixing fully reduced P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1, in the absence of excess reductant, with 2 mm potassium nitrite (called cd1-X in this work). cd1-X was formed by manual mixing of cytochrome cd1 and 2 mm potassium nitrite. Photodissociation of the cd1-X was achieved by mixing with buffer in the stopped-flow apparatus and allowing the mixture to remain in the flow cell for 60 s, where it was in the path of intense light (see Ref. 18George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Pseudoazurin-mediated dissociation of cd1-X was achieved by mixing cd1-X with one-tenth stoichiometric oxidized pseudoazurin to enzyme monomer in the stopped-flow apparatus. The spectrum after 0.5 s is shown. The spectra are normalized for final concentration of cytochrome cd1. All solutions were prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Reactions were carried out anaerobically at 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Upon close inspection of the data shown in Fig. 1, it is apparent that there are two distinct kinetic phases of the reaction between cd1-X and initially oxidized pseudoazurin at one-tenth the stoichiometry of the cd1 monomer. In the region above 600 nm, where only the d1 heme absorbs (21Kobayashi K. Koppenhöfer A. Ferguson S.J. Tagawa S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the phases can be clearly separated from one another. Up to 100 ms after mixing cd1-X with pseudoazurin, the first phase was dominant, and an isosbestic point was apparent at 642 nm. From 100 ms onward, the second phase dominated the absorbance change with an isosbestic point at 635 nm. The first 100 ms of the absorbance change at 635 nm (Fig. 3A) fitted to a single exponential with kobs = 24 s-1. The rate constant of the second phase of the reaction was determined by plotting the absorbance change at 642 nm, the wavelength at which there is no change during the first phase of the reaction, against time (Fig. 3B). After an initial lag of ∼100 ms, the change at 642 nm fitted to a single exponential with kobs = 5 s-1. Oxidation of the c heme was measured by subtraction of the change in absorbance at 539 nm from the change in absorbance at 549 nm (Fig. 3C). This enables determination of the absorbance change at the c heme by substantially eliminating the d1 heme contribution and is necessary because there is no wavelength at which the c heme absorbs without some contribution from the d1 heme (see also Ref. 18George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The two separate phases of the 549 nm minus 539 nm trace (up to 100 ms and from 100 ms onward) were fitted to separate single exponentials with kobs1 = 10 s-1 and kobs2 = 4 s-1. The first phase of oxidation of the c heme appears to occur at about half the rate of the first phase occurring at the d1 heme in which decay of the 632 nm peak is observed. The second phase of oxidation of the c heme occurs at a rate similar to that of the second phase occurring at the d1 heme. It is clear from the data presented so far that the addition of pseudoazurin causes the otherwise kinetically stable complex of cytochrome cd1 and NO, referred to as cd1-X in this work, to react in a manner that is dependent on pseudoazurin concentration. We assign the product of this reaction as fully oxidized cytochrome cd1 with nitrite bound to the d1 heme (i.e. from which NO had dissociated). Th"

Timely degradation of many cell cycle regulators is fundamental to the maintenance of proper cell cycle progression. Here we report novel mechanism(s) that govern the tight regulation of TRIP-Br2 levels during cell cycle progression. TRIP-Br2 was observed to be a short-lived protein in which the expression level peaks at the G1/S boundary. TRIP-Br2 accumulated in cells treated with 26 S proteasome inhibitors. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that TRIP-Br2 forms ubiquitin conjugates. In silico analysis identified a putative leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) motif that overlaps with the PHD-Bromo interaction domain in the acidic C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of TRIP-Br2. This NES motif is highly conserved in widely divergent species and in all TRIP-Br family members. TRIP-Br2 was shown to be stabilized in G2/M phase cells through nuclear entrapment, either by deletion of the acidic C-terminal TAD, which includes the NES motif, or by leptomycin B-mediated inhibition of the CRM1-dependent nuclear export machinery. Mutation of leucine residue 238 of this NES motif abolished the interaction between CRM1 and TRIP-Br2, as well as the nuclear export of TRIP-Br2 and its subsequent 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation.

The TRIP-Br/SERTAD (henceforth referred to as TRIP-Br (transcriptional regulator interacting with the PHD-bromodomain)) family of mammalian transcriptional coregulators has been shown to play important roles in governing cell cycle progression, at least in part, by regulating the expression of E2F-responsive genes that are implicated in or directly linked to the regulation of cell proliferation (1Hsu S.I.

In addition, the TRIP-Br homolog in Drosophila, Taranis (TARA), was identified in a screen for functional partners of the homeotic loci and was shown to represent a novel member of the trithorax group of regulatory proteins (4Calgaro S. Boube M. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.M. Genetics. 2002; 160: 547-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRIP-Br proteins are recruited to the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein-dissociated E2F-1·DP-1 complexes on E2F-responsive promoters through physical association with DP-1. PHD zinc finger- and/or bromodomain-containing proteins such as p300/CBP, PCAF, and KRIP-1, present in differing amounts and possessing different binding affinities, have been proposed to compete for binding to TRIP-Br proteins and confer positive or negative regulatory signals to E2F-1·DP-1 transcription complexes assembled on E2F-responsive promoters (1Hsu S.I.

Antagonism of the TRIP-Br integrator function has been shown recently to elicit a proliferative block and caspase-3-independent cellular subdiploidization, associated with the transcriptional down-regulation of a subset of E2F-responsive genes in vivo (7Sim K.G. Zang Z. Yang C.M. Bonventre J.V. Hsu S.I. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Members of the TRIP-Br family possess four evolutionary conserved regions including a putative cyclin A-binding motif [including a conserved nuclear localization signal (NLS), KRK] at the amino terminus, a novel SERTA (S.E.I-1, RBT1 and TARA) domain and an acidic TAD at the C terminus, which also includes a PHD zinc finger and/or bromodomain (PHD-Bromo) interaction domain (4Calgaro S. Boube M. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.M. Genetics. 2002; 160: 547-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of the SERTA domain remains to be elucidated, studies have shown that this motif of TRIP-Br1 binds to cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and facilitates the assembly and activation of cyclin D·CDK4 complexes (8Sugimoto M. Nakamura T. Ohtani N. Hampson L. Hampson I.N. Shimamoto A. Furuichi Y. Okumura K. Niwa S. Taya Y. Hara E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3027-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Notably, the C terminus of TRIP-Br proteins is required not only for the stimulation of E2F-mediated transcription by TRIP-Br1, TRIP-Br2, and RBT1 (1Hsu S.I. Yang C.M. Sim K.G. Hentschel D.M.

Yoshida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35633-35648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Members of the TRIP-Br protein family share a similar but unusual genomic structure. All members have intronless coding regions but possess one intron in their 5′-untranslated regions. In addition, the splice acceptor site is always found within 7 bp of the ATG start codon (5Darwish H. Cho J.M. Loignon M. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4319-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). TARA, the Drosophila homolog of mammalian TRIP-Br genes, also contains one intron in its 5′-untranslated region (4Calgaro S. Boube M. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.M. Genetics. 2002; 160: 547-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains unknown whether TRIP-Br proteins are regulated by post-transcriptional modifications such as alternative splicing. We recently reported that TRIP-Br2 is a novel proto-oncogene that is overexpressed in multiple human tumors such as prostate carcinoma, squamous cell lung carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, ovarian cystadenocarcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its overexpression was associated with up-regulation of E2F-mediated transcription, transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and promotion of tumor growth in athymic nude mice. 4J. K. Cheong, L.

In contrast, knockdown or global knock-out strategies demonstrated that a decrease or absence of TRIP-Br2 expression results in cell proliferation arrest (2Sim K.G. Cheong J.K. Hsu S.I. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 4J. K. Cheong, L. Gunaratnam, Z. Zang, M. L. Yang, X. M. Sun, S. L. Nasr, K. G. Sim, B. K. Peh, S. Abdul Rashid, J. V. Bonventre, M. Salto-Tellez, and S. I. Hsu, submitted for publication. Because the loss and gain of function of TRIP-Br2 leads to cell proliferation arrest and tumor progression, respectively, we investigated whether transcriptional and/or translational regulation of TRIP-Br2 may serve to tightly control the precise execution of its function during cell cycle progression. We demonstrate that TRIP-Br2 protein (not transcript) expression peaks at the G1/S boundary and progressively decreases through S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. The oscillatory nature of TRIP-Br2 expression in cell cycle progression is shown to be tightly regulated by the closely related ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation and CRM1-mediated nuclear export pathways. We provide the first evidence that a TRIP-Br protein may form ubiquitin conjugates and may possess an intrinsic NES motif that directly regulates its turnover and function during cell cycle progression.

Cell Synchronization and Flow Cytometric DNA Content Analysis—U2OS cells and COS-7 cells were grown to 50% confluence on 100-mm culture dishes 24 h prior to incubation with 10 mm HU for an additional 24 h to synchronize them at the G1/S boundary (modified from Liu and Erikson (11Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8672-8676Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)). Cells were released from G1/S block and harvested at the indicated time points for flow cytometric DNA content, semiquantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot (WB) analyses. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) at a wavelength of 488 nm. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (3 μg) was reverse transcribed using the ABI high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed on 1-μl cDNA samples in the presence of 10 mm dNTPs and specific primer pairs (at 10 μm) in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. PCR was performed as follows: 20 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (51 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min) with a 2-min initial denaturation step at 94 °C and a 3-min terminal polishing step at 72 °C. The primer sequences used for RT-PCR are available upon request. Protein Degradation and 26 S Proteasome Inhibition Assays—A CHX chase assay for the analysis of protein degradation was performed as described previously (12Gardner R. Cronin S. Leader B. Rine J. Hampton R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2611-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (untransfected and transfected) were exposed to CHX (20 μg/ml) over a given time course. To achieve 26 S proteasome inhibition, cells were exposed to ALLN (50 μm), MG132 (25 μm), or lactacystin (5 μm) over a given time course. Whole cell lysates were prepared from the drug-treated cells at the indicated time points for semiquantitative RT-PCR and WB analyses. Immunoprecipitation and Immunocytochemistry—Transfected cells were washed twice with PBS, and cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cells with gentle rocking in ice-cold modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 μg/ml each). The cell lysates were precleared with protein A/G plus-agarose beads (sc-2003, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min prior to centrifugation at 14,000 × g (4 °C, 15 min). The supernatants were then incubated overnight with preconjugated anti-HA-protein A/G plus-agarose beads (sc-7392AC, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-GAL4DBD-protein A/G plus-agarose beads (sc-510AC, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). These agarose beads were precipitated with centrifugation at 1000 × g (4 °C, 5 min) and washed five times with ice-cold modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. They were then resuspended in 60 μl of 2× WB sample loading buffer and boiled for 5 min prior to denaturing SDS-PAGE and WB analysis. To analyze the subcellular localization of endogenous TRIP-Br2, cells were grown to 80% confluence on coverslips, washed three times with PBS, fixed in prechilled 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton-X for 10 min. Primary immunostaining with rabbit anti-TRIP-Br2 antibody (G4195, 1:4000) was performed at room temperature for 1 h. To analyze the subcellular localization of GAL4DBD-hTRIP-Br2 and its derivatives, cells were grown to 50% confluence on coverslips and transfected as described above. After 48 h, transfected cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed in prechilled 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton-X for 10 min. Primary immunostaining with mouse anti-GAL4DBD antibody (1:300) was performed at room temperature for 1 h. Secondary immunostaining with goat anti-rabbit-Cy3 or goat anti-mouse-Cy3 antibody was performed at room temperature for 1 h following three washes with PBS at the end of primary immunostaining. Cellular DNA was subsequently counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Staining was visualized and photographed using a Nikon Eclipse E1000 fluorescence microscope. NES Motif Prediction Analysis and Nuclear Export Inhibition Assay—NES motif prediction was achieved by in silico interrogation of the human TRIP-Br2 primary amino acid sequence (GenBank™ accession number NP_055570) using a Web-based NES motif predictor, NetNES 1.1. To inhibit CRM1-mediated nuclear export, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml LMB for 2 h as described previously (13Lai I.L. Wang S.Y. Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. Gene. 2007; 388: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) prior to immunocytochemical or denaturing SDS-PAGE and WB analyses. Subcellular Fractionation, Denaturing SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Subcellular fractionation of cells was performed using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents kit (Pierce) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins from whole cell lysates were resolved using denaturing SDS-PAGE as described previously (1Hsu S.I. Yang C.M. Sim K.G. Hentschel D.M. O'Leary E. Bonventre J.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2273-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-TRIP-Br2 (G4195) polyclonal antibody and mouse anti-TRIP-Br1 monoclonal antibody, which were generated as described previously (14Zang Z.J. Sim K.G. Cheong J.K. Yang C.M. Yap C.S. Hsu S.I. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2007; 6: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), were used in WB and/or immunocytochemical analyses. The majority of antibodies used in WB analyses were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. They include anti-HA (sc-805 (Y11), sc-7392 (F7)), anti-cyclin D1 (sc-718), anti-cyclin A (sc-596), anti-CDK2 (sc-163), anti-PSer780Rb (sc-12901-R), anti-p27 (sc-1641), anti-HA (sc-805 and sc-7392), anti-GAL4DBD (sc-510), anti-lamin B (sc-6217), anti-GAPDH (sc-59540), anti-CRM1 (sc-5595), and β-tubulin (sc-5274). Anti-ubiquitin (Ub) (Z0458) was purchased from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). TRIP-Br2 Is Differentially Expressed during Cell Cycle Progression—Members of the TRIP-Br family of mammalian transcription coregulators have been shown to play key roles in regulating cell cycle progression. Our group and others have previously demonstrated that some members of this novel family of proto-oncogenes and/or tumor suppressors, such as TRIP-Br1, RBT1, and TRIP-Br3, are themselves tightly controlled during cell cycle progression by regulatory processes that remain elusive (1Hsu S.I.

Chem. 2006; 281: 35633-35648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have also recently shown that the loss and gain of function of the poorly studied TRIP-Br2 protein leads to cell proliferation arrest and tumor progression, respectively (2Sim K.G. Cheong J.K. Hsu S.I. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 4J. K. Cheong, L. Gunaratnam, Z. Zang, M. L. Yang, X. M. Sun, S. L. Nasr, K. G. Sim, B. K. Peh, S. Abdul Rashid, J. V. Bonventre, M. Salto-Tellez, and S. I. Hsu, submitted for publication. We envisaged that the tight regulation of TRIP-Br2 might serve to control the precise execution of its function(s) during cell cycle progression. To study whether TRIP-Br2 is regulated spatially and/or temporally during cell cycle progression, we synchronized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells at the G1/S boundary by exposure to 10 mm HU for 24 h before reversing the drug treatment. We found that the transcript levels of both TRIP-Br1 and TRIP-Br2 remained constant in all phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 1A). In contrast, TRIP-Br1 and TRIP-Br2 protein levels were differentially regulated during cell cycle progression (Fig. 1B). Both TRIP-Br1 and TRIP-Br2 levels accumulate at the G1/S boundary and decrease progressively through S phase until the G2/M phase of the cell cycle is reached. Proper cell cycle progression after the release from HU arrest was confirmed by the presence of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, Rb (P-Ser-780Rb), in the S phase and its subsequent dephosphorylation in the G2/M phase. Unlike non-oscillatory cell cycle-related proteins such as CDK2, TRIP-Br2 was also differentially expressed during cell cycle progression in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast to cyclin A, a known proliferation marker that is rapidly degraded when cells progress out of S phase, residual expression of TRIP-Br2 was observed in the G2/M and early G1 phases of the cell cycle in HU-synchronized cells. This suggests that TRIP-Br2 may play novel roles during these phases of the cell cycle, which may include cell division in the G2/M phase and mitogen sensing in the early G1 phase to facilitate its subsequent accumulation at the G1/S boundary in a positive autoregulatory loop. The higher molecular weight endogenous species observed in Fig. 1B are specific bands that we have observed in only a subset of human cancer cell lines, as detected by the rabbit polyclonal anti-TRIP-Br2 antibody used for immunoblot analyses. C-terminal HA-tagged TRIP-Br2 Is Susceptible to Rapid Turnover—Given that the transcript level of TRIP-Br2 did not vary across the different phases of the cell cycle, a post-translational regulatory mechanism may serve to limit the function of TRIP-Br2 in the G2/M and early G1 phases of the cell cycle by controlling the turnover of TRIP-Br2 proteins. We first performed cycloheximide chase analysis to examine the half-lives of endogenously expressed TRIP-Br2 and exogenously expressed N-terminal GAL4DBD-tagged TRIP-Br2 in COS-7 cells. Both endogenously expressed TRIP-Br2 and exogenously expressed N-terminal GAL4DBD-tagged TRIP-Br2 exhibited similar half-lives of approximately 2 h (Fig. 2A). However, when we performed cycloheximide chase analysis on C-terminal HA-tagged TRIP-Br2 in COS-7 cells, we observed that its half-life was significantly reduced to less than 30 min (Fig. 2B). Compared with known short-lived cell cycle regulatory proteins like cyclin D, which has a half-life of ∼1 h, we found that the C-terminal HA-tagged TRIP-Br2 was rapidly turned over with its half-life estimated to be about 20 min (Fig. 2C). It is unlikely that such control over the protein turnover of C-terminal HA-tagged TRIP-Br2 reflects a transcriptional mechanism, as its exogenous expression in transiently transfected COS-7 cells was driven by a strong and constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter. As shown in Fig. 2D, we demonstrated that the transcript level of C-terminal HA-tagged TRIP-Br2 did not vary across the time intervals of the cycloheximide chase analysis. These data suggest that the introduction of epitope-tagged sequences to TRIP-Br2 at the C terminus may have exposed encrypted degradation signals of TRIP-Br2 through changes in its native protein conformation. Degradation of TRIP-Br2 through the 26 S-dependent Proteasome Pathway—Protein turnover in eukaryotic cells is governed by multiple proteolytic systems, including the lysosomal proteases, calpains, the ATP-ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway, and an ATP-independent non-lysosomal process (15Barrett A.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 674: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway is known to be involved in regulating the turnover of key regulators of the cell cycle machinery such as cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (16Barinaga M. Science. 1995; 269: 631-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). To determine whether the 26 S proteasome complex is involved in the regulation of TRIP-Br2 protein turnover, we treated TRIP-Br2-HA-transfected COS-7 cells with known 26 S proteasome inhibitors MG132 (25 μm, 2 h) and ALLN (50 μm, 2 h). As shown in Fig. 3A, either MG132 or ALLN was sufficient to cause accumulation of TRIP-Br2-HA in COS-7 cells (compare treatment lanes 2 and 3 with control lanes 4 and 5). To investigate whether the 26 S proteasome complex may play a role in regulating TRIP-Br2 levels, we treated TRIP-Br2-HA-transfected COS-7 cells with a combination of cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) and MG132 (Fig. 3A, lane 1). We have earlier shown that TRIP-Br2-HA is a short-lived protein and has a half-life of ∼20 min in a cycloheximide chase analysis. The addition of MG132 prevented the 26 Sproteasome-dependent depletion of the existing pool of TRIP-Br2-HA in these cycloheximide-treated cells (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 6). In the absence of de novo synthesis of TRIP-Br2-HA and inhibition of the degradation of the existing pool of TRIP-Br2-HA, the TRIP-Br2-HA level was comparable with that observed under normal physiologic conditions (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 5) in which TRIP-Br2-HA is robustly synthesized and actively degraded. We observed a similar increase in TRIP-Br2-HA protein stability when COS-7 cells were treated with lactacystin, another specific inhibitor of 26 S proteasome activity (Fig. 3B). Notably, the protein stability of TRIP-Br2-HA increased over time in lactacystin (5 μm)-treated COS-7 cells (Fig. 3C). In addition, MG132 (25 μm, 2 h) was sufficient to prevent the degradation of both TRIP-Br1-HA and TRIP-Br2-HA in NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts stably overexpressing these TRIP-Br proteins (Fig. 3D). The accumulation of TRIP-Br2-HA in these cells was clearly observed within 1 h of MG132 treatment (Fig. 3E). A similar phenomenon was observed when U2OS cells, which abundantly express endogenous TRIP-Br2, were treated with MG132 or ALLN. WB analysis of endogenous TRIP-Br2 in U2OS cells following a MG132- or ALLN-prolonged treatment time course (6 h) revealed a ladder of higher molecular weight TRIP-Br2 species, which is a characteristic of polyubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 3F). These data suggest that the 26 S proteasome may regulate the turnover of the two TRIP-Br family members, TRIP-Br1 and TRIP-Br2. As the protein level of TRIP-Br2 has been shown to be higher at the G1/S boundary and throughout most of the S phase, we sought to determine whether TRIP-Br2 is more susceptible to the 26 S proteasome-dependent proteolysis in other phases of the cell cycle, such as the G2/M phase, by treating asynchronously cycling COS-7 cells as well as G1/S phase-synchronized and G2/M phase-synchronized COS-7 cells with MG132. The synchronized cell populations were derived from treatment of asynchronously cycling COS-7 cells with 10 mm HU for 24 h; the drug effect was reversed to allow cycling of the synchronized cell populations. The G1/S phase-synchronized cells and G2/M phase-synchronized cells were collected at 1 and 20 h following the release from HU arrest, respectively, prior to a 2-h MG132 treatment (25 μm). The asynchronously cycling COS-7 cells that were subjected to MG132 treatment were used as a positive control. WB analysis of endogenously expressed TRIP-Br2 following MG132 treatment of asynchronous or synchronized COS-7 cells showed that MG132 alone was sufficie"
https://openalex.org/W2029533522,"Sepsis causes extensive apoptosis of lymphocytes, a pathological condition that is frequently associated with hyperthermia. Heat stress has been implicated to repress the activation of an inflammatory mediator, nuclear factor of κB (NF-κB), which sensitizes cells to apoptosis mediated by inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor α. However, the molecular mechanism of hyperthermia-associated loss of T cells remains unclear. We show that hyperthermia causes rapid translocation of IκB kinase (IKK) and NF-κB complexes into the plasma membrane-associated lipid rafts in T cells. Heat stress induces aggregation of Carma1 in lipid rafts, which in turn recruits protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ) and Bcl10 to the microdomains, causing subsequent membrane translocation of the IKK and NF-κB signalosomes. Depletion of Carma1 and inhibition of PKCθ impair accumulation of NF-κB complexes in lipid rafts. Heat stress prohibits IκB kinase activity by sequestrating the IKK and NF-κB complexes in lipid rafts and by segregating the chaperone protein Hsp90, an essential cofactor for IKK, from the IKK complex. This process ultimately results in functional deficiency of NF-κB and renders T cells resistant to tumor necrosis factor α-induced activation of IKK, thereby contributing to the apoptotic loss of T lymphocytes in sepsis-associated hyperthermia."
https://openalex.org/W2098552582,"Axin plays an architectural role in many important signaling pathways that control various aspects of development and tumorigenesis, including the Wnt, transforming growth factor-β, MAP kinase pathways, as well as p53 activation cascades. It is encoded by the mouse Fused (Fu) locus; the AxinFu allele is caused by insertion of an IAP transposon. AxinFu/Fu mice display varying phenotypes ranging from embryonic lethality to relatively normal adulthood with kinky tails. However, the protein product(s) has not been identified or characterized. In the present study, we conducted immunoprecipitation using brain extracts from the AxinFu mice with specific antibodies against different regions of Axin and found that a truncated Axin containing amino acids 1–596 (designated as AxinFu-NT) and the full-length complement of Axin (AxinWT) can both be generated from the AxinFu allele. When tested for functionality changes, AxinFu-NT was found to abolish Axin-mediated activation of JNK, which plays a critical role in dorsoventral patterning. Together with a proteomics approach, we found that AxinFu-NT contains a previously uncharacterized dimerization domain and can form a heterodimeric interaction with AxinWT. The AxinFu-NT/AxinWT is not conducive to JNK activation, providing a molecular explanation for the dominant negative effect of AxinFu-NT on JNK activation by wild-type Axin. Importantly, AxinFu-NT exhibits no difference in the inhibition of Wnt signaling compared with AxinWT as determined by reporter gene assays, interaction with key Wnt regulators, and expression of Wnt marker genes in zebrafish embryos, suggesting that altered JNK signaling contributes, at least in part, to the developmental defects seen in AxinFu mice.

In Wnt signaling, Axin provides a platform for the assembly of the β-catenin degradation complex to keep the activity of β-catenin in check, which otherwise would lead to developmental defects such as axis duplication and outgrowth of tissues or tumorigenesis. It also forms complexes with the upstream MAP kinases MEKK1 or MEKK4 to activate JNK and p38 MAP kinases (8Luo W. Ng W.W. Jin L.H. Ye Z. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol.

In addition, binding of GSK-3β, casein kinases, or dishevelled can attenuate Axin activation of JNK by competing against MEKK binding or disrupting Axin homodimerization, suggesting that Axin activation of the MAPKs is highly conformation-dependent (10Zhang Y.

We recently showed that Axin-mediated JNK activation plays a critical role in dorsoventral patterning, in that Axin exerts two opposing roles, one to down-regulate β-catenin and cause ventralization and the other to activate JNK leading to dorsalized embryos when overexpressed (12Rui Y.

While the IAP insertion occurs at intron 6 in the FuFused allele, IAP is inserted into exon 7 in FuKnobbly. FuKinky, FuKnobbly, and FuFused are dominant mutations, which are presumably caused by their truncated proteins resulting from the IAP insertion. Several studies have examined the nature of the mRNA transcripts from the FuFused allele. Vasicek et al. (19Vasicek T.J. Zeng L. Guan X.J. Zhang T. Costantini F. Tilghman S.M. Genetics. 1997; 147: 777-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a 3.9-kb mRNA corresponding to wild-type Axin RNA could be detected in both wild-type and FuFused homozygous mice by Northern blotting, suggesting that the IAP insertion does not entirely prevent the generation and processing of the FuFused allele into a normal mature Axin transcript. However, transcripts that terminate immediately after exon 6 were also detected, suggesting the existence of other Axin transcripts that could potentially create a premature stop codon caused by the aberrant splicing between exons 6 and 7 (19Vasicek T.J.

It is also believed that the inserted IAP may provide an internal promoter that may yield transcripts encoding a C-terminal portion of Axin.

Zool. 1949; 110: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Jacobs-Cohen R.J. Spiegelman M. Cookingham J.C. Bennett D. Genet.

A. 2003; 100: 2538-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the phenotypic penetrance of the Fused allele is highly epigenetic, i.e. some AxinFu/Fu homozygotes die prenatally, and some can develop into adulthood with kinked tails. In heterozygotes, some adult mice display kinky tails, and some do not. These variations in phenotypes among animals with the same genotype are likely a reflection of epigenetically regulated expression of the mutated Axin gene. It was reported that the presence or absence of the characteristic phenotype, a kinky tail, correlates with differential DNA methylation at the retrotransposon within AxinFu or the overall levels of methylation of the AxinFu gene (23Rakyan V.K. Chong S. Champ M.E. Cuthbert P.C. Morgan H.D. Luu K.V. Whitelaw E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2538-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Consistently, Waterland et al. (24Waterland R.A. Dolinoy D.C. Lin J.R. Smith C.A. Shi X. Tahiliani K.G. Genesis. 2006; 44: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) reported that the supply of methyl donor to female mice before and during pregnancy resulted in increased DNA methylation at AxinFu and thereby reduced half the incidence of tail kinking among AxinFu/+ offspring. Nevertheless, the fact that some AxinFu/Fu homozygotes die prenatally suggest that AxinFu-NT can cause lethal defects during early development of mouse embryos. However, the protein products from any of the Fused alleles have not been characterized. To understand the molecular nature of the naturally occurring mutant of Axin would shed new light on the multifunctionality and mechanisms thereby of Axin. In this study, we first generated a new polyclonal antibody against a C-terminal region of mouse Axin, in addition to the previously used C2b antibody raised against amino acids 348–500 (5Liu W. Rui H. Wang J. Lin S. He Y. Chen M. Li Q. Ye Z. Zhang S. Chan S.C. Chen Y.G. Han J. Lin S.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1646-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), to identify the protein products encoded by FuFused mRNA. As a result, we have identified a truncated protein of Axin that contains amino acids 1–596, which is designated as AxinFu-NT, but were unable to detect any of the proposed truncate containing a C-terminal portion of Axin. We found that heterozygous and homozygous AxinFu mice all express the full-length complement of Axin (AxinWT). When cotransfected, AxinFu-NT abrogated JNK activation by wild-type Axin, indicating that AxinFu-NT exerts a dominant negative effect on this aspect of Axin function. When AxinFu-NT and wild-type Axin were co-expressed, homodimerization between wild-type Axin was disrupted by AxinFu-NT, suggesting AxinFu-NT possesses a domain that interacts with the wild-type Axin. GST pull-down of brain extracts from AxinFu mice using GST-AxinNT400 that contains the N-terminal 400 amino acids, also showed that endogenous Axin can form a complex with the N-terminal Axin fragment. This provides a strong explanation as to how AxinFu-NT abrogates Axin-mediated JNK activation. Surprisingly, AxinFu-NT down-regulates Wnt signaling as effectively as AxinWT. When tested in zebrafish embryos, AxinFu caused severe ventralized phenotypes that can be partially rescued by co-injection of JNK. Our current study has thus characterized the molecular nature of the AxinFu mice, providing new insight into the structure and function of Axin. AxinFu Mice and Genotyping—Inbred 129P4/RrRk AxinFu/+ mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Genomic DNA was isolated from the mouse ear. Mice were genotyped for the AxinFu and wild-type alleles by multiplex PCR using the following primers: P23: 5′-cggagctattccgagaacg-3′, G245: 5′-gaccagagcccaagaaaaaccc-3′ and IAP forward: 5′-gcgcatcactccctgattg-3′ according to protocols from Dr. Frank Costantini (Columbia University). Preparation of Mouse Brain Extract—For brain protein extract preparation, the mouse brain was homogenized in 2 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (5Liu W. Rui H. Wang J. Lin S. He Y. Chen M. Li Q. Ye Z. Zhang S. Chan S.C. Chen Y.G. Han J. Lin S.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1646-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) containing 0.1% SDS with Polytron centrifuged at 1700 × g for 30 s on ice. Samples were sonicated three times for 10 s each and centrifuged at 18,000 × g rpm for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Array. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with C2b or CT36 antibody raised against Axin. Plasmid Constructions—Expression vectors for HA- or Myc-tagged wild-type mouse Axin (short form), HA-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), HA-β-catenin, HA-casein kinase Iα (CKIα), Wnt-1, HA-MEKK1-CT, HA-MEKK4-CT, and FLAG-JNK, were constructed as previously described (8Luo W.

AxinFu-NT and AxinFu-CT were generated by PCR amplification using the following primers: AxinFu-NT:5′-ccatatgcagagtcccaaaatgaatg-3′ (forward), and 5′-ctcacccaaagggcaaatccccagc-3′ (reverse); AxinFu-CT:5′catatgtcttgttctcccagtggtaaaactagtgcaccttc-3′ (forward), and 5′-ctcagtccaccttttccaccttgccgatg-3′ (reverse). The fragments were then subcloned into pCMV5-HA, Myc, or FLAG, and, into pXT7 for in vitro transcription. All PCR products were verified by sequencing. Fish and Microinjection—Zebrafish embryos of the Tubingen strain were incubated in Holtfreter′s solution at 28.5 °C. Capped mRNAs were synthesized using T7 Cap Scribe (Roche Applied Science) according to the protocol described previously (26Zhao J. Cao Y. Zhao C. Postlethwait J. Meng A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6078-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-UTP labeled antisense RNA probes were generated by in vitro transcription and used for whole mount in situ hybridization (27Joly J.S. Joly C. Schulte-Merker S. Boulekbache H. Condamine H. Development. 1993; 119: 1261-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Thisse C. Thisse B. Halpern M.E. Postlethwait J.H. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK293T, HEK293 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and 2 mm l-glutamine, and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in a humidified incubator. Transfection was performed using PEI. For transfection in 60-mm dishes; transfection mixture was prepared by adding DNA into 240 μl of HBS (150 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and 180 μl of 10 μm PEI (Cat. 23966, Polysciences, dissolved in HBS), immediately followed by mixing. The mixture was left at room temperature for about 30 min before dropping into cells. During the 30-min incubation, the cell medium was changed with 1.0 ml of DMEM (fetal bovine serum (FBS)-free). After 6–12 h of transfection, the FBS-free DMEM medium was changed with complete DMEM medium. Preparation of Antibodies—Mouse anti-HA (F-7), anti-Myc (9E10), rabbit anti-MEKK1 (C-22), and goat anti-Axin (S-20, R-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse anti-FLAG (M2) and mouse anti-β-tubulin were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) was purchased from Cell Signaling. The polyclonal antibody against Axin (C2b) was described previously. For the rabbit polyclonal anti-Axin (CT36) antibody, the GST fusion protein containing the amino acid sequence from amino acids 676–832 was produced in BL21 bacterial cells and injected into rabbits following purification using glutathione-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitation, Immunokinase Assay, and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (9Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) at 36-h post-transfection, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies for about 3 h. Then beads were spun down and washed with lysis buffer three times. The proteins were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer and along with the total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with different antibodies. The immunokinase assay on JNK activation was performed as previously described (9Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Assay—GST-AxinNT400, which contains the Axin N-terminal-half (amino acids 1–400), was expressed in BL21 bacterial cells transformed with pGEX-AxinNT400 bacterial expression plasmid and was purified with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C. Approximately 0.2 mg of the GST fusion protein bound to agarose beads was added to each brain extract from adult Axin+/+ and AxinFu/Fu mice, and incubated for 3 h with gentle rotation, followed by washing three times with lysis buffer. The proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer. Transcription Reporter Assay—For the LEF-1 reporter assay, 0.5 μg of LEF-1 reporter gene and 0.1 μg of LEF-1 were co-transfected with HA-Axin or HA-AxinFu-NT or both of them into HEK293T cells. Wnt1 (0.1 μg) was also transfected as indicated. At 30-h post-transfection, cells were lysed, divided into two portions, and each measured for the activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase. The ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity varied less than 10% among samples. Data are presented as means plus standard deviation from three separate experiments performed in duplicate. Detection of a Truncated N-terminal Fragment of Axin in AxinFu Mice—In some of the heterozygous (AxinFu/+) mice (36/134), the tails appeared normal, whereas all of the homozygotes showed kinked tails with some of the kinked tails also having bifurcation at the distal end. These observations are consistent with previous reports showing that, AxinFu/+ and AxinFu/Fu adult mice display variable phenotypes characterized by kinked tails (13Reed C.S. Genetics. 1937; 22: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gluecksohn-Schoenheimer S. J. Exp. Zool. 1949; 110: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Jacobs-Cohen R.J. Spiegelman M. Cookingham J.C. Bennett D. Genet. Res. 1984; 43: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Based on previous work on the IAP insertion position and the detection of normal mature Axin mRNA transcript as well as aberrant transcripts, we outlined putative protein products resulting from the IAP insertion in the AxinFu allele (Fig. 1A). Normal mature Axin mRNA must be produced by splicing out the IAP sequence between the donor sequence of exon 6 and the acceptor site in exon 7. It was also speculated that the IAP-disrupted intron 6 may not be properly spliced out, and as a consequence the translation is extended into the intron sequence and prematurely terminated immediately after exon 6 junction as diagrammed in Fig. 1A. In addition, it was hypothesized that the long terminal repeat sequence in the transposon may serve as a promoter to drive transcription of the Axin sequence downstream of intron 6 to the 3′ terminus, resulting in a potential truncated protein containing amino acids 597–832 of Axin (19Vasicek T.J. Zeng L. Guan X.J. Zhang T. Costantini F. Tilghman S.M. Genetics. 1997; 147: 777-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rakyan V.K. Chong S. Champ M.E. Cuthbert P.C. Morgan H.D. Luu K.V. Whitelaw E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2538-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, none of the putative AxinFu protein species has been identified or characterized. We set out to identify the naturally occurring Axin truncates in the AxinFu mice. For convenience of characterization of the AxinFu truncates, we first generated cDNA fragments corresponding to the predicted AxinFu-NT and AxinFu-CT respectively, as diagrammed in Fig. 1A. In parallel, we generated an additional polyclonal antibody against a C-terminal region (amino acids 676–832) of Axin, which was designated as Axin antibody CT36. The antibody against the N-terminal Axin (antibody C2b) had been previously reported (5Liu W. Rui H. Wang J. Lin S. He Y. Chen M. Li Q. Ye Z. Zhang S. Chan S.C. Chen Y.G. Han J. Lin S.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1646-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The C2b and CT36 antibodies specifically react with AxinFu-NT and AxinFu-CT that were expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B). C2b recognized HA-Axin and HA-AxinFu-NT, but not AxinFu-CT; conversely, CT36 only reacted with the full-length Axin and HA-AxinFu-CT, but not AxinFu-NT. We carried out immunoprecipitation experiments with total brain protein extracts from adult Axin+/+, AxinFu/+ (with normal tail appearance), AxinFu/+ (kinked tail), and AxinFu/Fu mice. After immunoprecipitation with C2b and CT36 antibodies, the precipitated protein samples were separated on PAGE gels along with total lysates of HEK293T cells expressing untagged AxinWT (full-length, the first lanes, Fig. 2A), AxinFu-NT and AxinFu-CT (the last two lanes, on the right of Fig. 2A), which were constructed as diagrammed in Fig. 1A and were used as molecular weight references. The separated proteins were then subjected to immunoblotting with two commercial antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, S-20 (against the N-terminal region) and R-20 (against the C-terminal region). The antibodies are indicated on the left of each panel (Fig. 2A). In the wild-type mice, a protein with a molecular mass of ∼110 kDa that corresponds exactly to the control full-length Axin protein (lane 1 of Fig. 2A) expressed in HEK293T cells was detected in immunoprecipitates of C2b. In AxinFu mice, heterozygous or homozygous, a second specific protein species that co-migrated with the constructed AxinFu-NT was also detected by S-20 that was raised against the N-terminal region of Axin. These results showed that the proposed AxinFu-NT indeed exists in mice containing the AxinFu allele. We also carried out immunoprecipitations with the CT36 antibody, followed by Western blotting with the different antibodies indicated. In the immunoprecipitates, only the full-length Axin protein was specifically detected by all the antibodies; no specific Axin species corresponding to the putative AxinFu-CT was detected (Fig. 2A). However, it remains possible that the failure to detect the AxinFu-CT is due to the high background of the Western blot. Protein levels of tubulin in the mouse brain extracts were detected by immunoblotting and served as an internal loading control. AxinFu-NT Effectively Attenuates Wnt Signaling—To characterize the functional properties of the AxinFu-NT protein, we first tested whether it affects Wnt signaling. The AxinFu-NT and TOPFLASH reporter were co-transfected with or without Wnt1, into HEK293T cells, and the luciferase activities at 30-h post-transfection were measured. As shown in Fig. 3B, AxinFu-NT attenuated Wnt signaling almost as effectively as the wild-type Axin. Similar results were obtained using a similar reporter, the LEF-1 luciferase plasmid (Fig. 3A). Consistently, the AxinFu-NT protein interacted with GSK-3β, β-catenin, and APC with similar affinities compared with wild-type Axin (Fig. 3, C–E). We also examined the interaction between AxinFu-NT and CKIα, and the results demonstrated that AxinFu-NT also effectively interacts with CKIα, albeit with slightly lesser affinity (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that AxinFu-NT is fully capable of forming the degradation complex and promoting the GSK3β-mediated, phosphorylation-dependent, β-catenin degradation. When injected into zebrafish embryos, AxinFu-NT could down-regulate the expression of dharma/boz that is a specific maternal β-catenin target (30Fekany K. Yamanaka Y. Leung T. Sirotkin H.I. Topczewski J. Gates M.A. Hibi M. Renucci A. Stemple D. Radbill A. Schier A.F. Driever W. Hirano T. Talbot W.S. Solnica-Krezel L.

Development. 2000; 127: 3899-3911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as effectively as AxinWT (Fig. 3G, upper panel). At the shield stage, the zygotic β-catenin target tbx6 (32Lekven A.C. Thorpe C.J. Waxman J.S. Moon R.T. Dev Cell. 2001; 1: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) in zebrafish was also impaired by AxinFu-NT to the same extent as AxinWT (Fig. 3G, lower panel). The statistics of the phenotypic changes in those differently injected embryos is shown in Fig. 3H. Identification of an N Terminus Proximal Dimerization Domain of Axin—The AxinFu allele is a gain-of-function mutation. We therefore tested whether AxinFu-NT can form a dimeric interaction with the wild-type Axin. We performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay in HEK293T cells transfected with HA-tagged wild-type Axin and Myc-tagged AxinFu-NT. When co-expressed, HA-Axin was detected in the immunoprecipitate by anti-Myc (Fig. 4A), suggesting that AxinFu-NT forms a heterodimer with wild-type Axin. To verify that, we also transfected differentially tagged AxinFu-NT into HEK293T and carried out immunoprecipitation. HA-AxinFu-NT was detected in the immunoprecipitate by anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that AxinFu-NT could strongly interact with wild-type Axin, unexpectedly revealing a previously unidentified dimerization domain in the N-terminal region of Axin. To further confirm that the N-terminal of Axin could form a homodimer, we carried out a GST pull-down assay with GST-AxinNT400 corresponding to the N-terminal-half (amino acids 1–400) and the brain extracts separately from adult Axin+/+and AxinFu/Fu mice. Consistently, pull-down with GST-AxinNT400 and the brain extract of AxinFu/Fu mice produced two Axin protein species corresponding to the full-length wild-type Axin and AxinFu-NT, but only the wild-type Axin was detected from the pull-down using the extract of Axin+/+ mice (Fig. 4C). The Axin proteins were not seen in the pull-down using GST alone. Dominant Negative Effect of AxinFu-NT on Axin-induced JNK Activation—Next, we tested if AxinFu-NT has an effect on JNK activation. Whereas wild-type Axin robustly activated JNK in HEK293T cells, AxinFu-NT failed to activate JNK, in agreement with our observations that Axin strictly requires its C-terminal regions for JNK activation (11Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Liu D.X. Neo S.Y. He X. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-3215"
