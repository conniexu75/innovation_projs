An alternative method for achieving pulsatile release involves using microfabrication technology to develop active devices that incorporate micrometre-scale pumps, valves and flow channels to deliver liquid solutions. Here we report a solid-state silicon microchip that can provide controlled release of single or multiple chemical substances on demand. The release mechanism is based on the electrochemical dissolution of thin anode membranes covering microreservoirs filled with chemicals in solid, liquid or gel form. We have conducted proof-of-principle release studies with a prototype microchip using gold and saline solution as a model electrode material and release medium, and we have demonstrated controlled, pulsatile release of chemical substances with this device."

The mechanism of action has only recently begun to be elucidated. Exogenous decorin activates the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, thereby triggering a signaling cascade that leads to phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, induction of p21, and growth suppression. In this study we demonstrate a direct interaction of decorin with the EGF receptor. Binding of decorin induces dimerization of the EGF receptor and rapid and sustained phosphorylation of MAP kinase in squamous carcinoma cells. In a cell-free system, decorin induces autophosphorylation of purified EGF receptor by activating the receptor tyrosine kinase and can also act as a substrate for the EGF receptor kinase itself. Using radioligand binding assays we show that both immobilized and soluble decorin bind to the EGF receptor ectodomain or to purified EGF receptor. The binding is mediated by the protein core and has relatively low affinity (K d ∼87 nm). Thus, decorin should be considered as a novel biological ligand for the EGF receptor, an interaction that could regulate cell growth during remodeling and cancer growth.

Thus, decorin should be considered as a novel biological ligand for the EGF receptor, an interaction that could regulate cell growth during remodeling and cancer growth. Decorin plays a pivotal role in regulating the proper assembly of collagenous matrices and in the control of cell proliferation (1Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). Most of its biological interactions occur via the central leucine-rich repeat region, which is thought to fold into an arch-shaped structure (2Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Because of the ability of decorin to bind fibrillar collagen and to delay in vitro fibrillogenesis (3Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), this proteoglycan is regarded as a key modulator of matrix assembly. Genetic studies utilizing decorin null mice have indeed proved a major role for decorin in the homeostasis of dermal collagen. Although the nullizygous animals grew to adulthood without any overt pathology, a close analysis revealed a skin fragility phenotype; the dermal collagen exhibited aberrant organization of fibrils with abnormal packing and a great variability in diameter (4Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Another important role of decorin is linked to its ability to inhibit transforming growth factor-β, which in turns blocks cell proliferation (5Border W.A. Noble N.A. Yamamoto T. Harper J.R. Yamaguchi Y. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1992; 360: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). There is also mounting evidence that decorin is involved directly in the control of cell growth. Decorin levels are markedly elevated during growth arrest and quiescence, its expression is abrogated by viral transformation, and its transcription is suppressed in most tumorigenic cell lines (6Mauviel A. Santra M. Chen Y.Q. Uitto J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11692-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). De novo expression of decorin induces a generalized growth suppression by activating p21, a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase activity (7Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C.

Exogenous decorin causes dimerization of the EGFR in A431 squamous carcinoma cells. Decorin induces autophosphorylation of the EGFR by activating the EGFR tyrosine kinase in a cell-free system and can also act as a substrate for the EGFR kinase itself. Both immobilized and soluble decorin bind to the soluble EGFR ectodomain or to immunopurified EGFR. The binding is solely mediated by the protein core and has relatively low affinity (K d ∼87 nm). Thus, decorin should be considered as a novel biological ligand for the EGFR. Media and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Hyclone Laboratories, Inc. (Logan, UT). [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and Hybond ECL membranes were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The EGFR preparation purified from A431 cells by immunoaffinity chromatography (Sigma) contained ∼500 units of active EGFR; 1 unit catalyzes the incorporation of 1 pmol of phosphate/min from [γ-32P]ATP into poly(Glu,Tyr) at 30 °C. Confluent A431 cells, which were rendered quiescent by serum deprivation for 36 h, were incubated with decorin or decorin protein core (1 μm) or EGF (16 nm) or various combinations at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were washed extensively and incubated for 10 min with the membrane-impermeable cross-linker bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate (BS3, (Pierce). The cell lysates were separated in 3–15% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting (10Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M. McQuillan D.J. Wong A.J. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) with anti-EGFR antibody. The anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibody (New England BioLabs) detects p42 and p44 MAP kinases (Erk1/Erk2) only when they are catalytically activated by phosphorylation at Thr202 and Tyr204. Constant amounts (∼300 ng) of immunopurified EGFR were preincubated with buffer alone or containing increasing concentrations (5–20 μg) of decorin, its decorin protein core, or collagen type I. After 15 min of incubation in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 40 μmNa3VO4, 0.01% BSA, 15 μm ATP) 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 was added to reach a final volume of 60 μl. The mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min, stopped by boiling in SDS buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Control samples omitting either [γ-32P]ATP or EGFR showed no activity. Because A431 cells synthesize a soluble form of EGFR of ∼105 kDa lacking the transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains (12Weber W. Gill G.N. Spiess J. Science. 1984; 224: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), serum-free medium conditioned by confluent A431 cells was concentrated by Centricon-50 and incubated with decorin, or its protein core immobilized on nitrocellulose filters, washed, and subjected to immunodetection with anti-EGFR antiserum. Briefly, serial dilutions of BSA, decorin, or its protein core were slot-blotted onto ECL nitrocellulose, blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% nonfat milk, and washed several times in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4). The membranes were incubated with the serum-free medium conditioned by the A431 cells, washed 3 more times, incubated with an antibody raised against the N-terminal sequence LEEKK of the human EGFR, and affinity-purified on a peptide linked to Sepharose. This antibody would not interfere with the binding because it recognizes the N-terminal end of the EGFR. As additional control, we used a mouse monoclonal antibody 225 raised against the EGF-binding domain of the EGFR (13Fan Z. Lu Y. Wu X. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27595-27602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We utilized columns containing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) as ligand (Qiagen) since the recombinant human decorin contains an N-terminal tag with 6 histidine residues (His6) that allows a rapid and efficient purification via Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (14Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). First we phosphorylated the immunopurified EGFR to reach a specific activity of ∼1.7 × 1017 cpm/mol using thein vitro phosphorylation assay described above. Following purification by Sephadex G-50 chromatography, constant amounts of32P-labeled EGFR were incubated with increasing concentrations of decorin or its core protein for 30 min at 4 °C under gentle agitation. The spin columns were equilibrated with 3 column volumes of binding buffer (300 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl), and then the samples were applied and spun at 750 × g for 5 min. Following two consecutive washes, the bound decorin-EGFR complexes were eluted with buffer containing 250 mmimidazole. Parts of the fractions were counted in a scintillation counter, and parts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Radioligand binding assays were performed as described before (15Milev P. Chiba A. Margolis R.K. Schachner M. Ranscht B. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6998-7005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Decorin was coated in removable Immulon 4HXB wells (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA), and binding of 32P-labeled EGFR was measured in TBS supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, and 1 mg/ml heat-inactivated BSA following incubation under gentle shaking (60 rpm) for 4–14 h. Reversible binding was demonstrated by incubation with 100-fold molar excess EGFR. After incubation the wells were washed with ice-cold TBS-T and then counted in toto. Scatchard plots were generated using the Ligand program as described before (16Milev P. Monnerie H. Popp S. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21439-21442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is well established that the general mechanism transmitting extracellular signals starts with binding of a growth factor to a cell surface receptor that in many cases carries an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (17van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). For example, EGF stimulates the formation of non-covalent homo- and heterodimers with other members of the family of receptor tyrosine kinase (17van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). The growth of some tumor cells bearing high levels of EGF receptors is paradoxically suppressed. For instance, A431 vulvar squamous carcinoma cells are stimulated to grow with picomolar amounts of EGF but are markedly growth inhibited with nanomolar amounts of the growth factor (18Barnes D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). EGF treatment of A431 cells causes a protracted induction of p21(19, 20), and similarly, antibodies that recognize the EGF-binding region of the EGFR inhibit the proliferation of normal and transformed cells (13Fan Z. Lu Y. Wu X. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27595-27602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Fan Z. Baselga J. Masui H. Mendelson J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4637-4642PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fan Z. Mendelsohn J. Masui H. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21073-21079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Van de Vijver M.

Thus, we reasoned that decorin might induce growth suppression by activating a similar signal-transducing pathway. To test whether decorin could cause dimerization of the EGFR, we added purified decorin proteoglycan or its protein core to quiescent A431 cells at 4 °C for 1 h, washed extensively, and incubated for 10 min with BS3, a non-cleavable, membrane-impermeable cross-linker. Decorin induced significant dimerization of the EGFR (Fig.1 A, lanes 4 and 8), estimated to be ∼40% of that induced by EGF (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). There were no additive effects when decorin or its protein core were added concurrently with EGF (Fig. 1, A, lanes 6 and 10, and B, lane 6). The protein core of decorin was capable of mediating the full effect of the decorin proteoglycan (Fig. 1 B). To investigate this further, we iodinated decorin and performed similar cross-linking experiments followed by immunoprecipitation. We found a very high M r complex that could not penetrate the gel (not shown), further suggesting the decorin might be directly involved in binding to the EGFR. To investigate whether decorin induces rapid and sustained activation of the MAP kinase signal-transducing pathway, we exposed quiescent A431 cells to 1 μm decorin or its protein core for either 18 h or 10 min. As positive and negative controls we used EGF (16 nm) and collagen (1 μm), respectively. The results showed both a sustained (Fig.2 A) and rapid (Fig. 2,B and C) activation of the MAP kinase signal pathway, which leads to prolonged activation of the endogenous p21 and block of the cells in G1 (10Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M. McQuillan D.J. Wong A.J. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To more directly investigate the interaction between the EGFR and decorin, we used EGFR purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from plasma membranes of A431 cells (25Yarden Y. Harari I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 315-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EGFR was not exposed to EGF during the purification procedure, and thus it contains optimal kinase activity and is suitable for both binding and in vitro kinase assays. First, we established by Western immunoblotting the purity of the EGFR and the lack of degradation products. A single ∼170-kDa band was seen using an antibody against the N terminus of the EGFR (Fig. 2 D). When the EGFR was subjected to in vitro kinase assay there was a dose-dependent induction of EGFR autophosphorylation only in the presence of decorin (Fig. 2 E, lanes 2–4) or its protein core (Fig. 2 E,lanes 5–7) but none in the presence of collagen (Fig. 2 E, lanes 8–10). Of note, the EGFR kinase efficiently phosphorylated decorin protein core as seen by the appearance of the two ∼42- and 46-kDa proteins seen only when the protein core was added (Fig. 2 E, lanes 5–7). No significant phosphorylation of the decorin proteoglycan (which would have appeared as a ∼100-kDa band) was noted, indicating that the actual phosphorylation of the protein core may be inhibited by the dermatan sulfate chain. The binding of decorin to the EGFR was totally abolished by thermal denaturation (80 °C for 15 min) of both decorin and its protein core (not shown). The same treatment of the EGFR abolished the binding to decorin. Thus, proper protein folding is required for this interaction. The rationale for these studies is based on the observation that A431 cells synthesize and release into the medium a soluble form of EGFR of ∼105 kDa lacking the transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains (12Weber W. Gill G.N. Spiess J. Science. 1984; 224: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Weber W. Bertics P.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14631-14636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This soluble protein is derived from the 2.8-kilobase mRNA transcribed from a rearranged EGFR gene on chromosome 7 (27Carpenter G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 881-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). As the extracellular domain has both a high Cys content and large amount of oligosaccharides, the ectodomain is quite stable and highly resistant to proteolysis. It binds with high affinity EGF (12Weber W. Gill G.N. Spiess J. Science. 1984; 224: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Weber W. Bertics P.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14631-14636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and available stoichiometry data show that 1 mol of EGFR binds 1 mol of EGF. First, we tested the purity of the medium conditioned for 48 h by A431 cells by performing Western immunoblotting. A single band of ∼105 kDa was detected using the anti-EGFR antiserum (Fig. 3 A). This material was used in slot-blot overlay assays in which both proteins (the immobilized and the soluble ligand) are under native conditions. Serum-free medium conditioned for 48 h by A431 cells was concentrated ∼8-fold by Centricon-50 and incubated with decorin, its protein core, or BSA immobilized on nitrocellulose filters, washed, and subjected to immunodetection with anti-EGFR antiserum (28Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S. Goldfarb M.P. Glass D.J. Lemke G. Yancopoulos G.D. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Both protein core (Fig. 3 B) and decorin (Fig. 3 C) bound specifically to soluble EGFR ectodomain, in contrast to BSA, which was unreactive. Of note, a chimeric biglycan/decorin protein containing the N terminus of biglycan and the remaining decorin gave identical results (not shown). Thus, the binding to EGFR is not mediated by the N terminus since biglycan did not cause activation of EGFR (10Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M. McQuillan D.J. Wong A.J. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). When similar slot-blot overlay assays were tested with monoclonal antibody 225 that reacts specifically with the EGF binding region of the EGFR (13Fan Z. Lu Y. Wu X. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27595-27602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there was no reactivity (not shown), suggesting that decorin might bind near or perhaps in the same location where EGF binds. To further corroborate the above results, we immobilized on nitrocellulose scalar amounts of media conditioned for various periods of time by A431 cells and performed overlay assays with soluble decorin followed by Western immunoblotting (29Fisher L.W. Stubbs III, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 61-65Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The results showed specific binding of decorin to serum-free medium conditioned by A431 cells, which contains the EGFR ectodomain (Fig. 3 D). As negative and positive controls we used either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Fig. 3 D) or scalar dilutions (50–0 ng) of purified decorin (Fig. 3 E), respectively. Our results show that decorin interacts specifically with the ectodomain of the EGFR either in solution or immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes. Next we sought to investigate whether soluble decorin could interact with the EGFR under physiological salt concentrations and in solution. The rationale for this approach is that decorin contains an N-terminal His6 tag that allows a rapid and efficient purification via Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (14Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Constant amounts of32P-labeled EGFR were incubated with increasing concentrations of decorin or its core protein for 30 min at 4 °C under gentle agitation. The Ni-NTA columns were equilibrated with 3 column volumes of binding buffer, and then the samples were applied and spun at 750 × g for 5 min. Following two consecutive washes, the bound decorin-EGFR complexes were eluted with buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. In two independent experiments there was specific binding of the EGFR to decorin since the amount of radioactive EGFR increased proportionally to the amount of interacting (Ni-NTA-bound) decorin (Fig. 4,A–C). Quantitation of both experiments gave a strong correlation with r 2 = 0.961 andp < 0.0005 (Fig. 4 D). Finally, to determine more precisely the binding affinity we utilized a radioligand binding assay where increasing concentrations of32P-labeled EGFR were tested on Immulon wells coated with decorin protein core (22 pmol). Binding of EGFR to decorin protein core was saturable (Fig. 4 E), and a Scatchard plot (Fig.4 F) gave a single straight line with K d∼87 ± 7.5 nm (n = 5). The binding of decorin to the radiolabeled EGFR was totally abolished by 100-fold molar excess of cold EGFR (not shown). In parallel experiments where 10-fold more decorin protein core was used to coat the wells, the binding of EGFR was rapidly saturable, and the data also yielded linear Scatchard plots (not shown). Notably, the affinity constant obtained in such experiments is ∼90-fold lower than that reported for the low affinity binding sites for EGF (∼1 nm) and ∼900-fold lower than the high affinity receptor for EGF (∼0.1 nm) (27Carpenter G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 881-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that decorin protein core causes a rapid phosphorylation of the EGFR in A431 cells, which leads to a specific activation of the MAP kinase signal pathway and to induction of endogenous p21. Several lines of evidence support a specific protein/protein interaction between decorin and the EGFR. We demonstrate for the first time that decorin is capable of inducing dimerization of the EGFR in live cells, a physiologic phenomenon previously shown to be a prelude to receptor activation. The specific binding occurs when decorin is either immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes or free in physiologic salt solutions. In a cell-free system, decorin induces autophosphorylation of purified EGFR by activating the receptor tyrosine kinase and can also act as a substrate for the EGFR kinase itself, although it is unlikely to be a substrate in vivo since decorin is an extracellular molecule. Decorin is capable of inducing EGFR tyrosine kinase and that both the binding and activation require properly folded protein moiety. Notably, DDR1 and DDR2, two “orphan” receptor tyrosine kinases, have been shown to be the receptors for fibrillar collagen (28Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S. Goldfarb M.P. Glass D.J. Lemke G. Yancopoulos G.D. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 30Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Similarly to the decorin/EGFR interaction, stimulation of the DDR receptor tyrosine kinase activity requires the native triple helical structure of collagen and occurs over an extended period of time (30Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The unexpected realization that extracellular matrix molecules can directly serve as ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases may change prevailing views about the mechanisms by which cells perceive and respond to the extracellular matrix signals. Because decorin is intimately associated with fibrillar collagen, a complex scenario where multimeric interactions take place in an integrin-independent manner should be considered. An increase in decorin content in the newly formed tumor stroma could potentially trigger a functional interaction with the EGFR, known to be highly expressed in most tumor cells, which would in turn start a signaling process that directly influences the cell cycle machinery."

The FA gene was identified by positional cloning and found to encode a 210-amino acid mitochondrial protein designated frataxin (2Campuzano V. Montermini L. Molto M.D. Pianese L. Cossée M. Cavalcanti F. Monros E. Rodius F. Duclos F. Monticelli A. Zara F. Cañizares J. Koutnikova H. Bidichandani S.I. Gellera C. Brice A. Trouillas P. De Michele G. Filla A. De Frutos R. Palau F.

Most cases of FA are because of the expansion of a polymorphic GAA trinucleotide repeat located in the first intron of the frataxin gene, resulting in reduced frataxin mRNA levels (3Montermini L. Andermann E. Labuda M. Richter A. Pandolfo M. Cavalcanti F. Pianese L. Iodice L. Farina G. Monticelli A. Turano M. Filla A. De Michele G. Cocozza S. Hum. Mol.

The defect responsible for FA also affects non-neuronal organs, and patients usually succumb to a cardiomyopathy in the fourth decade. Gait ataxia is the most common presenting symptom, and most patients eventually manifest dysarthria, areflexia, pyramidal weakness of the legs, extensor planar responses, and distal loss of joint position and vibration sense (1Harding A.E. Harding A.E. Deufel T. Advances in Neurology. 61. Raven Press Ltd., NY1993: 1-14Google Scholar). The frataxin protein is localized to the mitochondria (5Campuzano V. Montermini L. Lutz Y. Cova L. Hindelang C. Jiralerspong S. Trottier Y. Kish S.J. Gauchezux B. Trouillas P. Authier F.J. Durr A. Mandel J.-L. Vescovi A. Pandolfo M. Koenig M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1771-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), but its function has not been determined. The frataxin protein is highly expressed in neuronal and heart tissue (2Campuzano V. Montermini L. Molto M.D. Pianese L. Cossée M. Cavalcanti F. Monros E. Rodius F. Duclos F. Monticelli A. Zara F. Cañizares J. Koutnikova H. Bidichandani S.I. Gellera C. Brice A. Trouillas P.

Advances in Neurology. 61. Raven Press Ltd., NY1993: 1-14Google Scholar). Iron deposits have been found in the myocardium of FA patients, and myocardial mitochondrial respiration has been found to be defective (6Rötig A. de Lonlay P. Chretien D. Foury F. Koenig M. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Friedreich ataxia Yeast disrupted for YFH1 (yeast frataxin homologue) accumulate iron in mitochondria (7Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is damaged and mitochondrial respiratory activity is impaired (8Foury F. Cazzalini O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 9Wilson R.B. Roof D.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial iron accumulation in yeast with YFH1 deletions is associated with subnormal cytosolic iron concentrations (7Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Lowered cytosolic iron concentrations induce transcription of FET3, a component of the plasma membrane high affinity iron uptake system (10Hassett R.F. Romeo A.M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7628-7636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The increased rate of iron uptake results in a doubling of cellular iron content relative to wild-type cells, but the excess iron is abnormally localized to mitochondria. Mitochondrial defects in patients with FA and in the yeast model could be a direct result of mitochondrial iron accumulation. Alternatively, a deficiency of frataxin protein could result in mitochondrial damage, and iron overload may be one manifestation of the mitochondrial damage. This phenomenon has been observed in two patients with acquired idiopathic sideroblastic anemia (11Gattermann N. Retzlaff S. Wang Y.-L. Hofhaus G. Heinisch J. Aul C. Schneider W. Blood. 1998; 90: 4961-4972Crossref Google Scholar). To determine whether iron accumulation is the cause or consequence of the mitochondrial defect, we constructed a yeast strain that contains respiration-competent mitochondria and regulatable YFH1. Using this approach, we found that YFH1 maintains mitochondrial iron homeostasis at the level of iron efflux. This result indicates that under normal conditions there is a dynamic flux of iron through mitochondria, which is disrupted by the loss of YFH1. pMET-YFH was generated by polymerase chain reaction using YFH1 open reading frame-flanking primers (5′ cga gat atc tag agt gta gca atg att aa 3′ and 5′ ccc gag ctc tta gcg gcc gcg acc tcc ttg gct ttt aga aat ggc ct 3′) and was cloned behind a MET25 promoter in the vector pTf63. This vector has origins of replication for yeast (2μ) andEscherichia coli (ori), the URA3 gene to allow selection for yeast transformants, and the ampicillin resistance gene for selection in E. coli (12Askwith C.A. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 3018-3020Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. yfh1Δ cells (7Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) were mated either to wild type or to the fet3Δ strain DY1397–6α (12Askwith C.A. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 3018-3020Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The resulting diploids were transformed with the pMET-YFH plasmid and sporulated onto complete media lacking uracil and containing 2% glucose (CM-URA) and lacking methionine to maintain expression ofYFH1. Spores were analyzed for the presence of the disruptions by polymerase chain reaction and Southern analysis. Plasmid was maintained by growth on media lacking uracil throughout all experiments. MET-YFH cells and wild-type cells containing pTf63 were grown to log phase in CM-URA(+met), then washed and resuspended in CM-URA(+met) supplemented with59FeCl3 to a final iron concentration of 3.3 μm, and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Cells were then washed, resuspended in nonradioactive CM-URA(+met), and incubated with shaking at 30 °C for 3 h to allow the 59Fe to label the cellular iron pool. Cell samples were then grown for indicated times either in CM-URA(+met) or in CM-URA(−met) and placed on ice for the remainder of the experiment. Growth curves indicated that the cells were in log phase growth at all times, and time courses of wild-type and yfh1Δ cells indicated that incubation on ice did not affect cellular distribution of radioactive iron (data not shown). Washed cell samples were spheroplasted and Dounce-homogenized. Postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged (12,000 × g, 30 min) to generate organelle pellets, which were resuspended and layered onto preformed 0–25% iodixanol gradients. These gradients were spun at 10,000 × g for 2 h and then fractionated. Radioactivity in each fraction was measured, and the position of mitochondria in the gradients was determined by Western blotting and probing with monoclonal anti-porin antibody (Molecular Probes). To determine whether iron accumulation is the cause or consequence of the mitochondrial defect in yfh1Δ cells, we constructed the MET-YFH strain, which contains respiration-competent mitochondria, a deleted chromosomal copy of YFH1, and a plasmid-based, methionine-regulated YFH1. Cells grown in the absence of methionine expressed abundant YFH1 message, whereas addition of methionine produced complete repression of YFH1transcription within 2 h (Fig.1 A). Cells grown in the presence of methionine completely repressed YFH1 message, whereas removal of methionine resulted in full transcription ofYFH1 (Fig. 1 B). Correlated with YFH1induction was a suppression of FET3 transcription (Fig.1 B), whereas repression of YFH1 resulted in increased expression of FET3 mRNA within 4 h (Fig.1 A). Increased iron uptake correlated with the expression ofFET3 transcripts (Fig. 2). When cells were maintained in the absence of methionine, iron uptake remained low, whereas cells moved to media containing methionine rapidly induced the high affinity iron uptake system. This demonstrates that the cytosol becomes iron-depleted when YFH1 is repressed, because FET3 transcription and the high affinity iron transport system are positively regulated by iron deficiency (12Askwith C.A.

Cell. 1994; 76: 3018-3020Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (587) Google Scholar).Figure 2Repression of YFH1 produces a rapid increase in iron transport. Iron uptake of MET-YFH cells first grown in the absence of methionine and then transferred to media containing or lacking methionine is shown. Iron uptake was assayed in the presence of 0.5 μm59Fe and 1 mm ascorbate as described previously (12Askwith C.A. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 3018-3020Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (587) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the relationship between cellular iron accumulation and mitochondrial damage, MET-YFH cells were grown in media lacking methionine and then incubated in media containing or lacking methionine that was supplemented with increasing concentrations of iron. Cell samples were then washed and plated on media that lacked methionine and contained glucose as the carbon source. The resultant colonies were then replica-plated onto media containing 1% glycerol and 1% ethanol as carbon sources. Mitochondrial damage was assessed as the percentage of colonies that were petite, i.e. unable to grow when glycerol and ethanol were the sole carbon sources. In the absence ofYFH1, mitochondrial damage was proportional both to the amount of iron in the growth media and to the time cells were exposed to iron (Fig. 3 A). MET-YFH cells lacking FET3, which are defective for high affinity iron acquisition, demonstrated no iron-dependent mitochondrial damage even in the presence of 500 μm iron (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that the mitochondrial damage that follows YFH1 depletion is dependent upon cellular iron uptake. Cells with a deleted YFH1 gene demonstrated increased mitochondrial iron content. This accumulation could have resulted from either increased iron uptake or decreased iron efflux. To distinguish between these possibilities we monitored mitochondrial iron content following reintroduction of Yfh1p in yfh1Δ cells. MET-YFH cells grown in the presence of methionine were incubated with59Fe for 20 min and then grown in the presence of methionine for 3 additional hours to label cellular iron stores. Following this, cells were either maintained in media containing methionine or transferred to media lacking methionine to induce expression of YFH1. Cells were then homogenized and organelles were fractionated on iodixanol gradients. Virtually all59Fe was found in fractions that also contained the mitochondrial protein porin (Fig. 4). When maintained in media containing methionine, there was only a marginal, time-dependent decrease in mitochondria-associated iron (Fig. 4 A). When cells were incubated in medium lacking methionine to induce expression ofYFH1, there was a rapid decrease in mitochondria-associated iron (Fig. 4 B). Iron mobilized from the mitochondria was immediately available as cytosolic free iron as FET3transcription was rapidly repressed (Fig. 1 B). Although these data do not rule out an effect of YFH1 on mitochondrial iron uptake, they do establish that YFH1mediates the efflux of iron from mitochondria. In this study, we demonstrate a role for Yfh1p in maintaining mitochondrial iron homeostasis. Yfh1p is unlikely to be the actual transporter, as sequence analysis indicates that it contains no transmembrane sequences. Yfh1p may mediate iron efflux by Atm1p, an ABC transporter located in the mitochondrial inner membrane (13Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although yeast strains deleted for ATM1 show a mitochondrial iron accumulation phenotype similar to YFH1 deletion strains (14Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), a direct biochemical interaction between Yfh1p and Atm1p has yet to be determined. Our results suggest that the mitochondrial defect in tissues from patients with FA is the consequence of iron accumulation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that mitochondrial damage results from iron-mediated oxygen radical production. Reintroduction ofYFH1 resulted in the efflux of iron from mitochondria, suggesting that the excess mitochondrial iron in the similar FA syndrome may potentially also be mobilized. If this proves to be the case then perhaps chelation therapy should be considered for the treatment of FA, if a strategy for selectively chelating mitochondrial iron could be devised. Many drugs have been administered to patients with FA in an attempt to alleviate progression of the disease, including choline chloride, lecithin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, γ-vinyl, γ-aminobutyric acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and benserazide. None has had any beneficial effects, and current therapy of FA is limited to supportive care (1Harding A.E. Harding A.E. Deufel T. Advances in Neurology. 61. Raven Press Ltd., NY1993: 1-14Google Scholar). Patients with hereditary aceruloplasminemia exhibiting basal ganglion dysfunction because of iron accumulation in neuronal tissues have been successfully treated by chelation with desferrioxamine (15Miyajima H. Takahashi Y. Kamata T. Shimizu H. Sakai N. Gitlin J.D. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 41: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), indicating that it can chelate iron in neuronal tissues. Excess iron in cardiac myocytes is also accessible to desferrioxamine as demonstrated in patients with cardiac iron overload because of thalassemia (16Giardina P.J. Grady R.W. Semin. Hematol. 1995; 32: 304-312PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that Yfh1p affects iron efflux indicates that, under normal conditions, iron can both enter and exit yeast mitochondria. This suggests the existence of a mitochondrial iron cycle. A mechanism must exist to regulate mitochondrial iron accumulation in response to iron need, either for mitochondrial proteins or for heme synthesis, the final step of which occurs within the mitochondrial matrix. Increased mitochondrial iron demand could be met by either increased influx or reduced efflux. A priori we expected regulation to occur at the level of uptake, but there is no theoretical reason why the site of regulation could not be at the level of efflux. Excessive mitochondrial iron accumulation is found in erythroid precursors of patients with sideroblastic anemia. Iron deposition results from deficiencies in heme synthesis, due either to mutations in heme biosynthetic enzymes or to pharmacologic inhibition of porphyrin synthesis (17Kushner J.P. Lee G.R. Wintrobe M.M. Cartwright G.E. Medicine. 1971; 50: 139-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion that iron may only exit mitochondria as heme (18Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As our results suggest the existence of a yeast mitochondrial iron efflux pathway independent of heme, we propose that the homologous frataxin-mediated pathway may be inactivated or absent in cells of erythroid lineage. Inhibition of a pathway allowing efflux of free iron from erythroid mitochondria may support the high rate of heme biosynthesis required by this cell type. We thank J. Leslie and D. Ward for advice on gradient fractionation and J. Kushner for numerous helpful discussions."

However, only one isoform of TrxR has previously been identified in mammalian cells, and it has not been known whether this protein is expressed in mitochondria. We now describe the purification and cloning of a second type of TrxR, named TrxR2, from rat liver and demonstrate that this protein is specifically expressed in mitochondria. Rat liver was obtained from Bioproducts for Science, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Rabbit antiserum to rat TrxR1 was produced by immunization with purified enzyme according to standard procedures. Rabbit antiserum to TrxR2 was prepared by injection with a hemocyanin-conjugated peptide (RSGLDPTVTGCCG) corresponding to the COOH-terminal sequence of rat TrxR2, with the exception that the penultimate residue (Secys) was changed to Cys. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin G and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) immunoblot detection system were from Amersham; biotin-conjugated iodoacetamide,N-(biotinoyl)-N′-(iodoacetyl)ethylenediamine (BIAM), was from Molecular Probes; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine, and Neutravidin beads were from Pierce; and yeast GR was from Boehringer-Mannheim. Recombinant rat Trx was prepared as described (26Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Rat livers (1 kg) were homogenized in 4 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.05 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), pepstatin (0.5 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), and aprotinin (0.5 μg/ml). The homogenate was centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was adjusted to pH 5.0 with 1 m acetic acid and then centrifuged again at 70,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet and supernatant were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to TrxR1 and TrxR2 (see Fig. 6 A). TrxR1 was detected only in the supernatant, whereas TrxR2 was present mostly in the pellet. Thus, the supernatant and pellet served as the sources for purification of TrxR1 and TrxR2, respectively. For purification of TrxR1 (elution profiles of column chromatographies are not shown), the supernatant (40 g of protein) from the pH 5 precipitation step was adjusted to pH 7.8 with 1 m ammonium hydroxide and then applied to a DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia) column (10 × 16 cm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, and 0.01 mm AEBSF. The column was washed consecutively with 2.5 liters of equilibration buffer and 2.5 liters of equilibration buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 100 to 400 mm NaCl in 5 liters of equilibration buffer, and fractions (25 ml) were collected and assayed for TrxR1 by immunoblot analysis. The peak fractions (10.4 g of protein), corresponding to 300 to 380 mm NaCl on the gradient, were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.01 mm AEBSF, and then applied to a 2′5′-ADP-agarose column (2 × 7 cm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA. The column was washed with 100 ml of equilibration buffer, and proteins were then eluted stepwise with 100 ml each of equilibration buffer containing 200 mm KCl, equilibration buffer containing 200 mm sodium phosphate and 200 mm KCl, and equilibration buffer containing 1 mNaCl and 200 mm KCl. The 58-kDa TrxR1 was present almost exclusively in the fractions eluted by the buffer containing 200 mm KCl as revealed both by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Coomassie Blue staining and by immunoblot analysis. Peak fractions (19.8 mg of protein) were pooled and then adjusted to 1.2 m ammonium sulfate by addition of 4 mammonium sulfate. After removal of the resulting precipitate by centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a Phenyl-5PW high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column (0.75 × 7.5 cm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.2m ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with 60 ml of equilibration buffer, and proteins were then eluted with a decreasing linear gradient of 1.2 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in 120 ml of 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA. Peak fractions, corresponding to 0.8 to 0.64m ammonium sulfate on the gradient, were pooled, concentrated, dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA, divided into portions, and stored at −70 °C. The pellet derived from the pH 5 precipitation step described for the purification of TrxR1 was dissolved in 2 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.05 mm AEBSF, leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), and aprotinin (0.5 μg/ml). The pH of the suspension was adjusted to 7.8 with 1 m ammonium hydroxide. After centrifugation of the suspension, the resulting supernatant (7.3 g of protein) was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (10 × 16 cm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.01 mm AEBSF. The column was washed with 1.5 liters of equilibration buffer and then with 2.5 liters of equilibration buffer containing 50 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 50 to 800 mm NaCl in 5 liters of equilibration buffer, and fractions (20 ml) were collected. TrxR2 was assayed by immunoblot analysis (see Fig. 6 B). Peak fractions (numbers 80 to 120, containing 1.8 g of protein) were pooled, dialyzed overnight against equilibration buffer, and then applied to a 2′5′-ADP-agarose column (2 × 7 cm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA. The column was washed with 100 ml of equilibration buffer, and proteins were then eluted consecutively with 60 ml of equilibration buffer containing 20 mm KCl, a linear gradient of 20 to 200 mm KCl in 260 ml of equilibration buffer, 60 ml of equilibration buffer containing 200 mmKCl, 100 ml of equilibration buffer containing 200 mmsodium phosphate and 200 mm KCl, and 120 ml of equilibration buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 200 mm KCl. Fractions were assayed for TrxR2 by immunoblot analysis (see Fig. 6 C). Peak fractions eluted between 340 and 352 min were pooled and then adjusted to 1.2 m ammonium sulfate by adding 4m ammonium sulfate. After removal of the resulting precipitate by centrifugation, the supernatant (6.1 mg of protein) was applied to a Phenyl-5PW HPLC column (0.75 × 7.5 cm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.2 mammonium sulfate. The column was washed with 60 ml of equilibration buffer, and proteins were then eluted with a decreasing linear gradient of 1.2 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in 120 ml of 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and assayed for TrxR2 by immunoblot analysis (see Fig. 6 D). Peak fractions eluted between 32 and 42 min (2.1 mg of protein) were pooled, concentrated, dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT, divided into portions, and stored at −70 °C. The concentrations of recombinant Trx and TrxR1, TrxR2, and GR were determined spectrophotometrically, with A 280 values for 0.1% solutions of 0.738, 0.938, 1.081, and 1.091, respectively, which were calculated based on their amino acid composition. The concentrations of other proteins were determined with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. All procedures were performed in an anaerobic chamber with solutions that were free of oxygen. TrxR2 (130 μg/ml) in 1 ml of 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA was reduced by incubation for 10 min at room temperature first with 54 μm NADPH and then with 100 μm DTT. The reduced enzyme was dialyzed on ice against 50 mm Bis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm EDTA. The dialyzed protein (100 μg) was then incubated at room temperature and in the dark for 10 min in 4 ml of 50 mm Bis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μm BIAM. The biotinylation reaction was stopped by the addition of iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 7.5. After 10 min, the mixture was dialyzed twice against 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA. Dialyzed BIAM-labeled TrxR2 (80 μg) was digested by incubation overnight at room temperature with 4 μg of trypsin. One-fourth of the resulting digest was analyzed by HPLC on a C18 column; peptides were eluted with a linear gradient (0 to 60%, v/v) of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min over 60 min. Fractions (500 μl) were collected, and a portion (2 μl) of each was analyzed for BIAM-labeled peptide. Peptides were immobilized on maleic anhydride-activated microplates (Pierce) and labeled peptide was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and the peroxidase substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine, the oxidation of which was monitored spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. A major BIAM-labeled peptide eluted at 28.5 min. Two nonlabeled peptides that eluted at 38.3 and 40.1 min were also collected and subjected to sequence analysis. The remaining three-fourths of the BIAM-labeled TrxR2 digest were incubated with 15 μl of Neutravidin beads (30% slurry) for 50 min at room temperature. The beads were separated by brief centrifugation, washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% Lubrol, and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 6 mguanidine hydrochloride in 500 mm potassium phosphate (pH 2.5). The released peptides were further purified by HPLC on a C18 column as described above, and the BIAM-labeled peptide that eluted at 28.5 min was collected for sequence analysis. The purity and mass of the isolated BIAM-labeled peptide were assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization with time of flight detection (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy (Hewlett-Packard model G2025A), using sinapinic acid as the matrix (21Gladyshev V.N. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectroscopy was performed with a Hewlett-Packard model G1946A instrument interfaced to a model 1100 HPLC system equipped with a Vydac 218TP narrow bore C18 column. The effluent from the column (200 μl/min) was mixed in a tee with acetic acid, pumped by another 1100 series pump (100 μl/min), and the mixture was introduced into the mass spectrometer (27Apffel A. Fischer S. Goldberg G. Goodley P.C. Kuhlmann F.E. J. Chromatogr. A. 1995; 712: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation with a Hewlett-Packard model G1005 sequencer running version 3.5 of the manufacturer's chemistry program. Reduction of oxidized Trx was measured in a mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm NADPH, and 120 μm oxidized Trx. After addition of the TrxR source, the oxidation of NADPH was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm and 25 °C. The GR assay mixture contained 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm NADPH, 1 mm GSSG, and enzyme source in a final volume of 0.5 ml, and the reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm and 25 °C. For both TrxR and GR assays, activity was calculated as micromoles of NADPH oxidized per minute at 25 °C from the relationA 340 × 0.5/6.22. Assay mixtures lacking enzyme served as controls. Complementary DNA encoding TrxR2 was amplified from Marathon rat liver cDNA (CLONTECH) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the 5′ primer 5′-CA(G/A)CA(G/A)AA(C/T)TT(C/T)GA and 3′ primer 5′-GTNACNGGCTGCTGAGG, corresponding to the determined NH2-terminal (QQNFDLLVIGGGS) and COOH-terminal SGLDPTVTGCUG (where U represents Secys) sequences, respectively, of the purified protein. The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel, and the amplified 1.5-kilobase molecule was eluted from the gel with a Qiagen gel extraction kit. After ligation of the eluted DNA into the pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen) and transformation of Escherichia coli, positive clones were identified by nested-PCR with the internal forward primer 5′-GA(C/T)GA(C/T)ATNTT(C/T)TGG or the internal reverse primer 5′-CCA(G/A)AANAT(G/A)TC(G/A)TC, both of which were derived from the internal amino acid sequence HGITSDDIFWLK of TrxR2. Plasmid DNA was purified from the positive E. coli clones with a Qiagen miniplasmid preparation kit, and was sequenced with the T7 primer and pCR3.1 reverse primer on an ABI sequencer. To extend the 5′ sequence, we perfomed 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) by PCR with Marathon-Ready rat liver cDNA as the template, the adapter primer 1 (CLONTECH) as the forward primer, and a reverse primer complementary to the sequence 5′-CTGTGGCTGACTATGTGGAA. 5′-RACE was also performed with nested adapter primer 2 (CLONTECH) as the forward primer and a reverse primer complementary to the sequence 5′-GCAGCAGAACTTCGATCTC. PCR products were cloned into the TA vector and sequenced. The 5′-extended sequences determined from the two independent 5′-RACE experiments were identical. Similarily, the sequence of the 3′-untranslated region was determined by two independent 3′-RACE experiments with two different sense primers (5′-GCTTCATACGCACAGGTGATGCAG and 5′-TGGTTAAGCTGCACATCTCC) and the adapter primer 1 as the antisense primer. The Beckman Optima model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a four-place An-Ti rotor was used for sedimentation velocity experiments at 20.0 °C. The density (ρ) of the dialysate buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate-1.8 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (substituted for 1 mmDTT in centrifugation studies)) was determined to be 1.00546 g/ml at 20.00 ± 0.01 °C with a Paar DMA 58 densitometer, and the relative viscosity was determined to be 1.020 (28Shapiro B.M. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2153-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The partial specific volumes (v̄) of TrxR1 and TrxR2 were calculated to be 0.720 and 0.722 ml/g (29Zamyatnin A.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1984; 13: 145-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), respectively, from the amino acid sequences. The protein sample (0.34 ml) and dialysate buffer (0.35 ml) were loaded into the right and left sides, respectively, of a 4° Kel-F coated double-sector centerpiece in 12-mm cells that were equipped with plane ultraviolet-quartz windows. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 48,000 and 40,000 rpm for TrxR1 and TrxR2, respectively, while scanning in a continuous mode (0.003-cm steps) with triple averaging at 280 nm and 4-min intervals (after equilibration and radial calibration at 3000 rpm, at which speed radial and wavelength (9 to 11 averages at 1-nm resolution) scans were collected). The TRACKER program of A. P. Minton (http://bbri-www.eri.harvard.edu/RASMB/rasmb.html) was used to monitor the progress of runs. Observed sedimentation coefficients (s obs) were corrected to the density and viscosity of water at 20.0 °C, yieldings 20,w values of 1.0393s obs and 1.0395 s obs for TrxR1 and TrxR2, respectively. The time derivative method of Stafford (30Stafford III, W.F. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A231Google Scholar, 31Stafford III, W.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was used to estimate the molecular weights of TrxR1 and TrxR2; the diffusion coefficient (D) and sedimentation coefficient (s) were obtained from the half-width and maximum, respectively, of the Gaussian fit to the g(s *) distribution pattern from four late scans (Origin Windows g(s *) Velocity Program of Beckman Instruments), and the solute molecular weight (M) was calculated from the Svedberg equation, M =RTs/[D(1 − v̄ρ)]. The relation of D to the half-width or standard deviation of the Gaussian fit is given by D = (ς r mω2 t)2/2t, wheret is the sedimentation time in seconds, ω2 is the angular velocity of the rotor, and r m is the radial position of the meniscus (30Stafford III, W.F. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A231Google Scholar, 31Stafford III, W.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); t, ω2 t, and r m can be read from the output file from DC_DT in the Beckman g(s *) program. The selenium content of TrxR1, TrxR2, and the BIAM-labeled peptide derived from BIAM-labeled TrxR2 was determined with a Perkin-Elmer model 4100 ZL atomic absorption spectrometer with the use of a palladium-magnesium nitrate modifier and temperature conditions as described (32Daher R. van Lente F. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Calibration solutions were prepared by diluting the selenium stock solution (1 g/liter) with a solution containing 1.16 mmNa2HPO4, 0.31 mmKH2PO4, 10.26 μm NADPH, and bovine serum albumin (0.120 mg/ml) to give final concentrations of 0, 10, 30, and 90 μg/liter. Various concentrations of TrxR1 and TrxR2 were prepared in the same solution devoid of albumin; the BIAM-labeled peptide solution was prepared in double-distilled water. Frozen rat tissues (Pel-Freeze Biologicals) were sonicated in a solution containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, aprotinin (2.5 μg/ml), and leupeptin (5 μg/ml). The sonicates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for TrxR1 or TrxR2. Rat liver homogenates were prepared, and cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation as described (33Hakkola E.H. Autio H.H. Sormunen R.T. Hassinen I.E. Hiltunen J.K.

In previous studies, we have used the Trx system as the electron donor for reduction of H2O2 by peroxiredoxins (26Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) and for reactivation of H2O2-inactivated protein tyrosine phosphatase (6Lee S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Kim S.-R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). For these experiments, the 58-kDa TrxR, designated here as TrxR1, was routinely purified from rat liver by a procedure that included acidification of tissue homogenate to pH 5 and sequential chromatography of the acid-soluble proteins on DEAE Sephacel, 2′,5′-ADP-agarose affinity matrix, and Phenyl-5PW. A purification in which the pH 5 precipitation step was inadvertently omitted yielded two peaks of flavoprotein after the 2′,5′-ADP-agarose column step, as judged from the ratioA 280/A 460. The first peak eluted with the buffer containing 200 mm KCl and contained a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 58-kDa, whereas the second peak eluted with the buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 200 mm KCl and comprised predominantly a 55-kDa protein. Further purification of these peak fractions by phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography yielded highly purified preparations of the 58- and 55-kDa proteins (Fig. 1 A). Whereas both preparations exhibited TrxR activity, polyclonal antibodies to 58-kDa TrxR1 recognized the 58-kDa protein from the first peak but not the 55-kDa protein from the second peak (Fig.1 B), suggesting that the 55-kDa protein was not derived from TrxR1. The 55-kDa protein was thus named TrxR2. Like TrxR1, TrxR2 was demonstrated to be a flavin-containing protein by its absorption spectrum, which showed maxima at 280, 352, and 446 nm in a ratio of 1, 0.12, and 0.11, respectively (Fig. 1 C)"
https://openalex.org/W2062746203,"A cDNA encoding a new human matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), tentatively called MMP-23, has been cloned from an ovary cDNA library. This protein exhibits sequence similarity with MMPs, but displays a different domain structure. Thus, MMP-23 lacks a recognizable signal sequence and has a short prodomain, although it contains a single cysteine residue that can be part of the cysteine-switch mechanism operating for maintaining enzyme latency. The C-terminal domain is considerably shortened and shows no sequence similarity to hemopexin, whereas all human MMPs, with the exception of matrilysin, contain four hemopexin-like repeats. Furthermore, MMP-23 is devoid of structural features distinctive of the diverse MMP subclasses, including the specific residues located close to the zinc-binding site in collagenases, the transmembrane domain of membrane-type MMPs, or the fibronectin-like domain of gelatinases. Fluorescent <i>in situ</i> hybridization experiments showed that the human MMP-23 gene maps to 1p36, a location which differs from all MMP genes mapped to date. Recombinant MMP-23 produced in<i>Escherichia coli</i> exhibits low, but significant proteolytic activity against a synthetic substrate commonly used for assaying MMPs. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that MMP-23 is predominantly expressed in ovary, testis, and prostate, suggesting that this new MMP may play a specialized role in reproductive processes."

Collectively, these data led us to suggest that SPP is a prototype of a new class of lipid second messengers that can also act as first messengers (20Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R.

Commun. 1996; 227: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and H218/AGR16 (32Okazaki H. Ishizaka N. Sakurai T. Kurokawa K. Goto K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Neurosci. 1994; 5: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). H218 and Edg-3 are widely expressed in adult tissues, particularly in cardiovascular and nervous systems. However, the ligands, signal transduction pathways, and physiological functions of these receptors are still not known. Recently, Edg-3 and H218 were shown by An et al. (34An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughling S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) to confer responsiveness to SPP of a serum response element-driven reporter gene when expressed in Jurkat cells and to allow SPP-stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux inXenopus oocytes, suggesting that Edg-3 and H218 may also be functional receptors for SPP. However, no direct binding data were presented in this study, and therefore it is not clear at present whether Edg-3 and H218 are bona fide SPP receptors. Moreover, sphingosine and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) were almost as effective as SPP in Jurkat T cells. Since SPP and sphingosine may also act intracellularly, it was of interest to determine the specificities and affinities of Edg-3 and H218 for these lipids using our recently developed binding assay (20Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that both Edg-3 and H218 bind SPP with high affinity and remarkable specificity. Moreover, we have identified H218 as the receptor that mediates cell rounding and neurite retraction in response to SPP. SPP, sphinganine 1-phosphate (dihydro-SPP), sphingosine, N,N-dimethylsphingosine, and C2-ceramide were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratory Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). SPP was determined to be greater than 99% pure by thin layer chromatography analysis. C8-ceramide 1-phosphate was from Calbiochem. SPP-phosphonate and SPP-homophosphonate were synthesized as described by Tarnowski (35Tarnowski A. Bär T. Schmidt R.R. Bioorg. Medicinal Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 573-576Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cyclic SPP was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Other lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Serum and medium were obtained from Biofluids (Rockville, MD). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293; ATCC CRL-1573) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (ATCC CRL-1721) were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum (8Edsall L.C. Pirianov G.G. Spiegel S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6952-6960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). edg-1, edg-3, and H218genes were amplified by PCR from human and rat genomic DNA, respectively. The primers were designed to add aBamHI site at the 5′-end and a XhoI site at the 3′-end as follows: 5′-GAGGGATCCGGGCCCACCAGCGTCCCGCTG-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCGAGCTAGGAAGAAGAGTTGACGTTTCC-3′ for edg-1; 5′-GAGGGATCCGCAACTGCCCTCCCGCCGCGT-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCGAGTCAGTTGCAGAAGATCCCATTCTG-3′ for edg-3; 5′-GAGGGATCCGGCGGTTTATACTCAGAGTAC-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCGAGTCAGACCACTGTGTTGCCCTC-3′ for H218. PCR products were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing a myc epitope tag at the 5′-end (a generous gift of Dr. Peter Burbelo). The resulting plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions at a 4:1 ratio with pCEFL GFP, which encodes green fluorescent protein (a generous gift of Dr. Silvio Gutkind). The cells were then grown for 2 days to allow expression of receptors before experiments were performed. Transfection efficiencies were typically 30–35% for HEK293 cells and 10% for PC12 cells. HEK293 cells were transfected as described above and lysed in PBS containing 1% CHAPS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 10 μg/ml concentration each of leupeptin and aprotinin for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged, and equal amounts of protein from the supernatant were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and probed with monoclonal anti-c-Myc 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Bands were visualized with Super Signal chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. [32P]SPP was synthesized enzymatically using partially purified sphingosine kinase (36Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) as described previously (20Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The specific activity of [32P]SPP was 6 × 106 cpm/pmol. Cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of [32P]SPP in 200 μl of binding buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm NaF, 2 mm deoxypyridoxine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C. Unlabeled lipid competitors were added as 4 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin complexes (3Zhang H. Desai N.N. Olivera A. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with 200 μl of ice-cold binding buffer containing 0.4 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and bound [32P]SPP was quantitated by scintillation counting (20Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 12-well dishes coated with polylysine and transfected 2 days later with the indicated receptor expression plasmids together with pCEFL GFP, as described above. Following transfections, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum or 10% serum that had been stripped with activated charcoal to remove lipids (26Lee M.-J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed and placed in serum-free medium for the indicated times and then treated with vehicle or with 100 nm SPP. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 5% sucrose for 20 min at room temperature and photographed using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted fluorescence microscope connected to a Sony DKC5000 digital camera. Cells expressing GFP and GFP-expressing cells displaying rounded morphology were counted. At least three different fields were scored with a minimum of 300 cells scored. For neurite retraction assays, PC12 cells were transfected as above, incubated overnight, and then split into 6-well dishes in RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transferred to serum-free medium, and NGF (100 ng/ml) was added to induce differentiation. After 48 h, vehicle or 100 nm SPP was added for the indicated time, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 5% sucrose, and the morphology of transfected cells was evaluated by a blinded observer using a fluorescence microscope. Cells that had flattened, irregularly shaped cell bodies with neurite outgrowths were scored as differentiated. Cells with spherical shape lacking any neurite extensions and filopodia were scored as rounded. At least three different fields were scored for differentiated and rounded cells with a minimum of 100 cells scored. Cell rounding was expressed as the percentage of round shaped cells among total green fluorescent cells. Fixed cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with bisbenzimide trihydrochloride (24 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline; Hoechst dye 33258; Calbiochem) for 10 min. Stained cells were examined with an inverted fluorescence microscope. Transfected cells were marked by the expression of green fluorescent protein, and apoptotic cells were distinguished by condensed, fragmented nuclear regions using an ultraviolet filter. A minimum of 300 cells were scored. Quantitative binding studies with lysolipid agonists such as SPP and LPA have been hampered by the lipophilic nature of the ligand, resulting in very high levels of nonspecific binding (for example, see Ref. 37Zondag G.C.M. Postma F.R. Etten I.V. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, recently we have developed a sensitive assay for binding of SPP to cell surface receptors that overcomes these problems (20Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). To determine if the Edg-3 and H218 G protein-coupled receptors, which share 48 and 45% homology, respectively, with Edg-1, were capable of specifically binding SPP, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 expression plasmids containing H218 or edg-3 open reading frames with c-myc tags fused in frame at the N terminus. HEK293 cells were selected for these studies, since they have no specific SPP binding. Although no edg-1 mRNA expression can be detected by Northern analysis, barely detectable expression can be seen by RT-PCR. Additionally, a low level ofedg-3 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR; however, no product was seen using primers specific for H218 (data not shown). Western analysis confirmed that an approximately 43-kDa protein containing the c-Myc tag was expressed in cells transfected withedg-3 or H218 but not with the pcDNA3myc vector or in untransfected cells (Fig.1 A). H218- and Edg-3-expressing HEK293 cells display dramatically increased specific binding of [32P]SPP in comparison with untransfected and vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). HEK293 cells expressing H218 and Edg-3 had similar binding affinities for [32P]SPP with K D values of 27 and 23 nm, respectively (Fig.2).Figure 2SPP binding to H218 and Edg-3. Specific binding of [32P]SPP (defined as binding in the absence of unlabeled competitor minus binding in the presence of excess unlabeled ligand) to HEK293 cells transiently transfected with plasmids encodingH218 (A) and edg-3 (B) was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations.K D values were determined by hyperbolic curve fitting with Delta Graph 4.0 for Macintosh.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Several other lipids that are structurally related to SPP, especially SPC and LPA, often have similar effects to SPP, and it has been suggested that in some instances they may share the same receptor (21Yatomi Y.

Desidirio D.M. Sun G. Miller D. Tigyi G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, recently it has been suggested that LPA is a low affinity agonist for Edg-1 (39Lee M.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Thompson B.D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22105-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, the specificity of binding to H218 and Edg-3 for a variety of lipid analogs of SPP was tested. Similar to our previous results with Edg-1 (20Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), only unlabeled SPP and dihydro-SPP, which lacks the 4-trans-double bond present in SPP, effectively competed with [32P]SPP for binding to cells expressing either H218 or Edg-3 (Fig.3, A and B). Sphingosine had a small but statistically significant effect on SPP binding to both Edg-3 and H218, while ceramide had a similarly small effect on binding to H218 only. Interestingly, the homophosphonate analog of SPP, which differs from SPP in that the oxygen atom at the 1-position is replaced by a carbon atom, competed for binding to Edg-1 as effectively as did unlabeled SPP (Fig. 3 C), although it had only a slight effect on binding of SPP to Edg-3 and no effect on binding to H218 (Fig. 3, A and B). The other lipids tested, including both LPA and SPC, do not compete for binding of SPP to any of the three Edg family receptors (Fig. 3 and Ref.20Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Cell rounding is one of the most profound biological responses induced by low (nanomolar) concentrations of SPP that is thought to be mediated by a cell surface receptor (24Postma F.R. Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2388-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transfected with H218 and edg-3 exhibited marked changes in cell morphology and increased numbers of rounded cells in comparison with vector- and edg-1-transfected cells (Fig.4). To quantitate the magnitude of this response, the percentage of transfected cells, indicated by expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), which displayed rounded morphology, was determined. Expression of H218 or Edg-3 increased rounding of HEK293 cells, while Edg-1 did not have a significant effect (Fig.5 A). Since the loss of cell attachment can lead to death by apoptosis (40Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar, 41Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), the percentage of transfected cells that displayed apoptotic characteristics was also determined. Expression of H218 or Edg-3 also increased the percentage of transfected cells HEK293 cells that displayed fragmented nuclei characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 5 B). Edg-1 expression led to a significant but much smaller increase. Although this response was seen in the absence of exogenously added SPP, these cells were grown in the presence of serum, which has been shown to contain high levels of SPP (43Yatomi Y. Igarashi Y.

Edsall and S. Spiegel, unpublished observations. Under these conditions, HEK293 cell morphology was similar in all cells in the absence of SPP (Fig. 6). Treatment with 100 nm SPP induced modest cell rounding in vector-transfected and Edg-1-expressing HEK293 cells. However, SPP induction of cell rounding was dramatically increased by expression of H218, whereas expression of Edg-3 appeared to only slightly enhance the rounding effect of SPP. To quantify this response, the number of rounded cells, expressed as a percentage of the transfected cells identified by expression of GFP, was determined (Fig.7 A). Expression of all three receptors modestly enhanced the percentage of rounded cells in comparison with vector-transfected controls.

Ahp1p contains a peroxisomal sorting signal, suggesting a peroxisomal localization. AHP1 exerts strong antioxidant protective functions, as demonstrated both by gene overexpression and deletion analyses, and is inducible by peroxides in an Yap1- and Skn7-dependent manner. Similar to yeast Tsa1p, Ahp1p forms a disulfide-linked homodimer upon oxidation and in vivo requires the presence of the thioredoxin system but not of glutathione to perform its antioxidant protective function. Furthermore, in contrast to Tsa1p, which is specific for H2O2, Ahp1p is specific for organic peroxides. Therefore, with respect to substrate specificity, Ahp1p differs from Tsa1p and is similar to prokaryotic alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpC. These data suggest that Ahp1p is a yeast orthologue of prokaryotic AhpC and justifies its name of yeast alkyl hydroperoxide reductase.

The incomplete reduction of molecular oxygen during respiration and the lipid metabolism in peroxisomes leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations ROSreactive oxygen speciesPCRpolymerase chain reactionDTTdithiothreitolORFopen reading framet-BOOHtert-butyl hydroperoxide 1The abbreviations ROSreactive oxygen speciesPCRpolymerase chain reactionDTTdithiothreitolORFopen reading framet-BOOHtert-butyl hydroperoxide(1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). ROS are potent oxidants and can damage all cellular constituents (2Sies H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1986; 25: 1058-1071Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). They cause DNA base modifications and strand breaks and are therefore mutagenic. They can damage proteins and inactivate enzymes. Oxidation of membrane lipids can initiate free radical chain reactions, which alter cellular membranes and give rise to other very toxic reactive species such as lipid hydroperoxides, alkoxyl and peroxyl radicals, lipid epoxides, and aldehydes. To protect against the toxicity of ROS, aerobic organisms use an array of defense mechanisms (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine.

Among these, cytosolic and mitochondrial superoxide dismutases eliminate the O·̄2radical, cytosolic and peroxisomal catalases remove H2O2, and glutathione peroxidases reduce both H2O2 and alkyl hydroperoxides. The AhpC/TSA family, also referred to as peroxiredoxin, is a large family of newly discovered peroxidases that are highly conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (5Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Biofactors. 1994; 4: 177-180PubMed Google Scholar) and act to reduce hydroperoxides with electrons donated by NADPH via thioredoxin or other thiol-containing intermediates (6Jacobson F.S. Morgan R.W.

As an approach to this question, we have used a genetic selection for identifying genes, which could rescue the alkyl hydroperoxide hypersensivity of an skn7 null strain. We report the identification of one of the genes isolated from this selection, which we have named AHP1 (see below). Evidence is provided which demonstrates that the AHP1 gene product is a yeast antioxidant related to the AhpC/TSA peroxiredoxin family with alkyl hydroperoxide defense properties. Studies were performed with the wild type strain YPH98 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as indicated in the legends (MATa ura3-52lys2-801amber ade2-101ochre trp1-Δ1leu2-Δ1) and its isogenic derivatives yMT1 (yap1::LEU2), yMT2 (skn7::TRP1), yMT3 (yap1::LEU2, skn7::TRP1), yMT4 (gsh1::LEU2), yMT5 (ahp1::TRP1), yMT6 (tsa1::TRP1), and yMT7 (trr1::TRP1). The following strains were also used as indicated in the legends and are derived from W303: wild type strain EMY60 (MATa, ade3, ade2 trp1–1, leu2–3, 112, ura3–1, his3–11, can1–100), EMY61 (trx1::TRP1), EMY62 (trx2::LEU2), and EMY63 (trx1::TRP1, trx2::LEU2) and are a gifts from Dr. E. G. Muller (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (22Muller E.G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9194-9202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Muller E.G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24466-24471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The composition of synthetic complete medium (SC), rich broth medium (YPD), glucose (SMG), and galactose selective media (SMGal) are described elsewhere (24Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Strains were transformed by electroporation as described (25Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 273-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Standard protocols and buffers were used (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gene disruptions were performed by the one-step gene disruption technique (25Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 273-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Theskn7::TRP1 construct used to create yMT2 was a gift from Dr. H. Bussey (McGill University, Montreal, Canada) (27Brown L.L. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6908-6915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Theyap1::LEU2 construct used to create yMT1 was prepared by removing the YAP1 coding sequence from theBamHI site (+186) to the KpnI site (+1650) relative to the ATG and replacing it with the LEU2 gene. Theahp1::TRP1 deletion construct used to generate yMT5 was prepared by replacing the full AHP1 open reading frame (ORF) with the TRP1 gene. Basically, oligonucleotide primers were used to PCR-amplify 5′ (−680 to +5) and 3′ (+532 to +1530) regions of the AHP1 gene relative to the ATG. These PCR-amplified fragments were then subcloned upstream and downstream of the TRP1 gene. The deletion construct used to create yMT4 (gsh1::LEU2) was prepared by removing a 700-base pair DNA fragment from the HindIII site at −180 base pairs relative to the ATG up to the BamHI site at +511 and replacing it with the LEU2 gene. yMT6 and yMT7 were prepared by a one-step amplification protocol that replaced the entireTSA1 or TRR1 ORF with the TRP1 gene (28Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Danouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). The cDNA library plasmid pY1 contained the entireAHP1 ORF from −119 relative to the translation start to +614, 82 base pairs downstream of the stop codon. To generate pAHP1, the AHP1 gene was isolated by PCR amplification of total yeast DNA with oligonucleotides that primed from −984 to +614, and then cloned into the polylinker region of plasmid pRS426 between the BamHI and NotI sites. A S. cerevisiae cDNA library under control of the repressible GAL1 promoter in the centromeric vector pRS316 (29Liu H. Krizek J. Bretscher A. Genetics. 1992; 132: 665-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed into strain yMT2 (skn7::TRP1). Transformed cells were plated onto SMG lacking uracil and containing 1 m sorbitol.URA3 transformants were pooled from each plate separately, diluted, and then plated onto SMGal lacking uracil and containing t-BOOH (0.5 mm). Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 5–12 days. Plasmids recovered from viable colonies were analyzed by restriction digest and sequencing. Sequencing was performed using an automated Perkin-Elmer DNA sequencer according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Aliquots (10 μl) containing approximately 103 or the indicated cell number of an overnight culture were spotted on YPD plates containing oxidants at the indicated concentration. Plates were monitored after 3–6 days of incubation at 30 °C. Cells from an exponential growth culture were washed, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a density of OD600 of 0.1, and not exposed or exposed to peroxides at different concentrations for 1 h. Cells were then diluted and plated for colony survival. Yeast cells from overnight culture were diluted to an OD600 of 0.01 in SC medium and incubated with shaking at 30 °C until they reached an OD of 0.3. The cells were then aliquoted and incubated in the absence or in the presence of H2O2 (0.2 mm) or t-BOOH (0.2 mm) for 20 min. Total RNA was prepared by the hot phenol method (30Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). For each condition tested, 20-μg RNA samples were loaded per lane on an agarose gel containing formaldehyde, separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a Bio-Rad nylon membrane, and hybridized with an an AHP1 32P-labeled DNA specific probe produced by random priming (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridization of each blot with a small nuclear RNA U3(SNR17A)-specific 32P-labeled DNA probe served as a RNA loading control. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washes were carried out as described elsewhere (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridized membrane were exposed for autoradiography. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein spot identification were performed as described elsewhere (13Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Alkylation of protein free sulfhydryls before the second dimension was achieved as follows. The first dimensional gel rod was first reduced by a 10-min incubation in buffer A (30% glycerol, 6 m urea, 2.5% SDS, 0.001% bromphenol blue, 0.2 m Bis-Tris, 0.1 mHCl, and 67 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)). Alkylation was then performed by incubating the gel rod in buffer in which DTT was omitted, and iodoacetamide (222 mm) was added instead. A S. cerevisiae strain carrying askn7 null mutation fails to grow on medium containing 0.5 mm of t-BOOH (a synthetic alkyl hydroperoxide), whereas the isogenic wild type strain will tolerate up to 1.5 mm of this oxidant. We have searched for genes whose overexpression would rescue the t-BOOH hypersensitivity of the skn7 null strain using a galactose-inducible yeast cDNA library (29Liu H. Krizek J. Bretscher A. Genetics. 1992; 132: 665-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This library was used to bypass the possible Skn7 requirement for the expression of candidate genes. We expected to identify genes controlled by Skn7 and/or encoding alkyl hydroperoxide antioxidant defense activities. Strain yMT2 (skn7::TRP1) was transformed with theGAL1-controlled cDNA library. Forty thousand transformants were obtained and incubated on plates containing 0.5 mm t-BOOH. Viable colonies were recovered from these plates after 7 days and the corresponding library plasmids isolated. Five plasmids, able to increase the t-BOOH tolerance of the yMT2 strain upon retransformation, were shown to carry inserts of different sizes, but containing the same ORF. One of them, pY1, was further analyzed. pY1 was able to increase the tolerance to t-BOOH not only of yMT2 but also of yMT1 (a yap1 null strain) (Fig.1). Therefore, the gene carried on the pY1 plasmid has antioxidant properties. This gene was calledAHP1 for alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (see below) and further analyzed. The AHP1 gene is encoded at the YLR109W locus. Interestingly, its gene product has been recently identified as a 19-kDa protein by comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in the search of yeast proteins induced by H2O2(13Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Ahp1p is a protein predicted to be 176 amino acids long with a molecular mass of 19,108 Da (Fig.2). This predicted mass is in agreement with a molecular weight of 19,000 extrapolated from its mobility in denaturing polyacrylamide gels (13Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 6). Ahp1p contains 3 cysteine residues at positions 31 (Cys-31), 62 (Cys-62), and 120 (Cys-120). Ahp1p carries the C-terminal sequence AHL similar to the putative S(A)K(H/R)L(I) peroxisomal-like sorting signal sequence (31Gould S.J. Keller G.-A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A sequence comparison with the GenBank data base revealed that Ahp1p is highly similar throughout its entire sequence to five peroxisomal-like fungal proteins, and to three other prokaryotic proteins. Ahp1p has also a weak, yet significant similarity to the peroxiredoxin AhpC/TSA family.Figure 6Ahp1p can form a disulfide-linked homodimerin vitro. Autoradiogram of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis performed with total cellular extracts from [5S]methionine-labeled exponentially growing wild type YPH98 cells. The 19-kDa Ahp1p protein and the 40-kDa Ahp1p dimer identified by mass spectrometry are indicated by an arrow.A, extracts prepared from untreated cells. B, extracts prepared from cells exposed to H2O2(0.4 mm) for 15 min. C, alkylated extracts prepared from untreated cells. In this case, the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis procedure was modified by the following change; after the first-dimensional electrophoresis, the resulting polyacrylamide rod was incubated in a buffer containing DTT and then treated with iodoacetamide before subjecting it to the second electrophoretic dimension.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The sequences of the proteins that are highly similar to Ahp1p are compared in Fig. 3. Of the three Ahp1p cysteines, Cys-62 is the only one conserved among these related proteins and occupies a region with a high density of amino acid identities. Cys-31 is conserved only in Lipomyces kononenkoae peroxisomal-like protein and in Aspergillus fumigatus Aspf3 protein. C. bondinii PMP20 A and B proteins (32Garrard L.J. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13929-13937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the other related fungal protein sequences all contain a tripeptide peroxisomal-like sorting signal at their extreme C terminus. Inspection of these related sequences also shows that theHaemophilus influenzae Y572 protein has an additional C-terminal domain with a very strong similarity to the redox-active center of glutaredoxins (Fig. 3). C. bondinii PMP20 A and B are two isoforms of a protein that was identified as the most abundant peroxisomal proteins of methanol-exposed cells but was not assigned any specific function (32Garrard L.J. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13929-13937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Goodman J.M. Maher J. Silver P.A. Pacifico A. Sanders D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3464-3468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the other proteins shown in Fig. 3have an identified function. Nevertheless, the presence of a glutaredoxin-like domain in Y572 suggests that this protein might be involved in redox reactions. The overall similarity between Ahp1p and the AhpC/TSA family is confined in a very short sequence surrounding Ahp1p Cys-62 and the highly conserved N-terminal catalytic cysteine of the AhpC/TSA homology (5Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Biofactors. 1994; 4: 177-180PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This similarity between Ahp1p and the AhpC/TSA family is shared among all the Ahp1p homologues shown in Fig. 3. The functional importance of the N-terminal cysteine in the peroxidase function of Tsa1p (7Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.-W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that Ahp1p and its homologues may have an equivalent function. We therefore analyzed in detail the in vivo antioxidant properties of Ahp1p. A null mutation of the AHP1 gene that removes all its coding sequence was created. The viability of the resulting ahp1null strain demonstrates that this gene is not essential. Theahp1 null strain does not have any particular growth phenotype on glucose, galactose, acetate, pyruvate, or oleate media or under anaerobic conditions. The effect of the ahp1 null mutation was then tested on the stress tolerance to t-BOOH by a patch assay. Compared with its isogenic wild type control, theahp1 null strain is hypersensitive to t-BOOH (Fig.4 A). Conversely, high expression of AHP1 from a multicopy plasmid dramatically increases the resistance of the wild type strain toward t-BOOH (Fig.4 C). Note that the difference in t-BOOH sensitivity of wild type cells in panels A and C is related to the different strain backgrounds used in these experiments (see figure legend and “Experimental Procedures”). The role ofAHP1 in the stress tolerance to H2O2was then examined. In sharp contrast to its role in t-BOOH tolerance, the ahp1 null mutation barely affects the cell tolerance to H2O2 (Fig. 4 B) and high expression of AHP1 does not improve the wild type strain tolerance to H2O2 (Fig. 4 C). Similar results were obtained by a challenge assay (data not shown). These results suggested that AHP1 is involved in the cellular defense against t-BOOH but not against H2O2. This prompted us to compare the antioxidant properties of Ahp1p with those of the structurally related Tsa1p/peroxiredoxin. An in vitromeasurement of Tsa1p catalytic activity had shown that this enzyme is more efficient in reducing H2O2 than t-BOOH (7Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, the tsa1 null mutant is hypersensitive to killing by H2O2 and has a wild type resistance to t-BOOH (Fig. 4, A and B). The antioxidant properties of AHP1 were also tested toward several other oxidants and a metal (Fig. 4 D). Theahp1 null mutation results in a slight decrease in the tolerance to the thioloxidant diamide and to cadmium and suprisingly to an increase in the resistance to the superoxide generating redox cycling drug menadione. However, high copy expression ofAHP1 has no effect on the wild type strain tolerance to any of these compounds. Tsa1p1 reduces peroxides with electrons donated by thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH (7Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.-W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whereas AhpC reduces organic peroxides with electrons donated by the FAD-bound NADPH-dependent AhpF reductase (6Jacobson F.S. Morgan R.W. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus sought to determine the potential requirement of an electron donor system for the Ahp1p antioxidant function. The effect of overexpressingAHP1 on t-BOOH resistance was tested in strains deleted of thioredoxin 1 (TRX1), thioredoxin 2 (TRX2), or both TRX1 and TRX2 (Fig.5 A). The trx1 null strain has a normal tolerance toward t-BOOH, whereas thetrx2 null mutant is slightly more sensitive than the wild type strain to this oxidant (15Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) (compare Fig. 5 A with Fig.4 C). However, the trx1trx2 double null strain is hypersensitive to t-BOOH. In the trx1 null strain, overexpression of AHP1 results in a significant increase in the resistance to t-BOOH, similar to that seen in the wild type strain (compare Fig. 5 A and 4 C). In the trx2null strain, the effect of overexpressing AHP1 can be seen only at the lower t-BOOH concentrations. In the trx1trx2null strain, no effect can be seen upon overexpression ofAHP1. A thioredoxin reductase (TRR1) deletion mutant also displayed a t-BOOH-hypersensitive phenotype that was not improved by overexpression of AHP1 (data not shown). The effect of overexpressing AHP1 on t-BOOH resistance was also tested in strains deleted for γ-glutamylcysteine synthase (GSH1), the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis (Fig. 5 B). The gsh1 null strain appears slightly more resistant to t-BOOH than the wild type strain, suggesting that high levels of GSH are not required for the resistance to this oxidant (the gsh1 null strain is auxotroph for GSH and can only grow in the presence of at least minimal amounts of exogenous GSH supplement such as those present in YPD-rich medium; Ref.35Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In addition, the gsh1 null mutation does not affect the gain in t-BOOH resistance resulting from AHP1overexpression. Taken together, these data show that thioredoxins but not GSH are important in the protection against t-BOOH and provide indirect evidence for the requirement of the thioredoxin system, but not of GSH, in the antioxidant protective function of Ahp1p. Ahp1p was identified on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of total yeast proteins as a H2O2-inducible spot migrating at a pI of 4.5 and a molecular weight of 19,000. Interestingly, an unidentified H2O2-induced spot with a pI identical to that of Ahp1p and a molecular weight of 40,000 was observed (Fig. 6). We suspected that this unknown spot could represent a dimeric form or other covalent modifications of Ahp1p. This spot was indeed identified as Ahp1p by peptide mapping using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry (36Shevshenko A. Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar). We next asked whether the 40-kDa spot could represent a disulfide-linked dimer of Ahp1p. Cellular extracts subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis are initially reduced in a buffer containing 160 mm β-mercaptoethanol. However, some substrates could be potentially reoxidized during the second dimension, when all of the β-mercaptoethanol has been lost during electrophoresis. To test this hypothesis, the first dimension polyacrylamide rod was incubated in a buffer containing DTT to reduce any potentially reoxidized cysteine residues, and then treated in a buffer containing the cysteine alkylating agent iodoacetamide, which irreversibly blocks free sulfhydryls. As shown in Fig. 6, this procedure led to the complete disappearance of the 40-kDa spot. These data strongly suggest that the 40-kDa Ahp1p spot represents a disulfide-linked Ahp1p homodimer. Ahp1p is an abundant protein under non induced conditions, and its synthesis rate is increased by about 3-fold upon exposure to H2O2(13Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed whether the peroxide stimulation of Ahp1p was dependent upon Yap1 and Skn7. Northern blots were performed using an AHP1 specific probe and total RNA from exponentially growing wild type, yap1, and skn7 null cells that had not been treated or were treated with 0.2 mm amounts of either t-BOOH or H2O2. In wild type cells,AHP1 mRNA levels were significantly increased upon H2O2 (Fig.7 A) or t-BOOH (Fig.7 B) exposure, confirming the results of the two-dimensional gel analysis. In contrast, in yap1 or in skn7null strains, both uninduced and t-BOOH-induced AHP1mRNA levels were significantly decreased, although they could still be moderately induced by peroxide. However, this residual induction was not seen in the yap1skn7 double null strain, although some uninduced levels persisted (Fig. 7 C). Consistent with a transcriptional control by Yap1, the 5′ AHP1 flank contains the sequence TTAGTAA at position (−484) from the start codon, which perfectly matches a Yap1 response element (Fig. 1) (37Fernandes L. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6982-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Oxidative damage to lipids can lead to a variety of alkyl hydroperoxides, which are particularly detrimental due to their ability to initiate and propagate free radical chain reactions. Enzymes involved in the breakdown of alkyl hydroperoxides are thus important for protection against oxidative stress. We report here the characterization of AHP1, which encodes a yeast antioxidant important for the protection against alkyl hydroperoxides, and related to the AhpC/TSA peroxiredoxin family. Gene deletion and overexpression analyses have demonstrated thatAHP1 exerts strong antioxidant protective functions. Furthermore, the observation that AHP1 mRNA and protein levels are induced by peroxides in a Yap1- and Skn7-dependent manner also supports the notion that Ahp1p is involved in protecting yeast cells from oxidative stress. Therefore,AHP1 can be added to the growing list of yeast antioxidant genes of the Yap1 and Skn7 regulons, which includesTRX2-encoded thioredoxin (15Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), GSH1-encoded γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (19Wu A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GLR1-encoded glutathione reductase (20Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and TRR1-encoded thioredoxin reductase (17Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M. Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 101-110Google Scholar). Sequence analysis relates this antioxidant to the AhpC/TSA protein family. Although mostly confined to a small region surrounding Cys62 of Ahp1p and the highly conserved N-terminal cysteine of the AhpC/TSA proteins family (5Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Biofactors. 1994; 4: 177-180PubMed Google Scholar), this homology is functionally important because the N-terminal cysteine of yeast Tsa1p is the catalytic center of its peroxidase function (7Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.-W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The proposed catalytic mechanism for Tsa1p involves substrate peroxide reduction by Cys N terminus, which upon oxidation reacts with the Cys C terminus of another subunit to form an intermolecular disulfide. This disulfide is subsequently reduced with electrons donated by thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH (7Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.-W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It was observed that Ahp1p forms a disulfide-linked homodimer upon oxidation. Furthermore, genetic data suggested that the antioxidant protective function of AHP1 is independent of GSH but dependent upon both thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase. Therefore, the structural similarity between Ahp1p and Tsa1p may be extended to a common mode of action, which suggests that a peroxidase function underlies the antioxidant properties of Ahp1p. Of the three Ahp1p cysteines, Cys-62 would be most likely to be involved in direct substrate peroxide reduction. However, it is not clear whether another cysteine would play a role in the putative Ahp1p catalytic function, nor which cysteine(s) is (are) involved in homodimer disulfide bond formation. Site-directed mutagenesis of individual cysteines of Ahp1p will answer these questions. The antioxidant protective function of AHP1 appears specific for organic peroxides. The slight increase in H2O2 sensitivity, and perhaps the altered diamide tolerance phenotype seen in the ahp1 null mutant, could be related to the lipid hydroperoxides which might be generated upon exposure to these oxidants. Although not an oxidant, cadmium may also lead to the production of ROS through metal-catalyzed electron transfer (38Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radicals Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar, 39Brennan R.J. Schiestl R.H. Mutat. Res. 1996; 356: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and its toxicity might therefore be exacerbated by the lack of AHP1. It is unlikely that cadmium is a direct substrate for Ahp1p. The menadione hyperresistance phenotype of theahp1 null strain is not understood but could be related to a deregulated expression of superoxide defense genes. Interestingly, anin vivo comparison of the substrate specificities of Ahp1p and Tsa1p showed that, whereas Ahp1p activity is specific for organic peroxides, Tsa1p activity is specific for H2O2. This observed in vivo substrate specificity of Tsa1p is fully consistent with in vitro measurements of its catalytic activity toward t-BOOH and H2O2 (7Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, with respect to its substrate specificity, Ahp1p differs from Tsa1p and appears related to the Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpC, which is specifically involved in the breakdown of lipid and other alkyl hydroperoxides, but not of H2O2 (6Jacobson F.S. Morgan R.W. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eukaryotic cells have several enzymes involved in the breakdown of lipid hydroperoxides. The structurally related selenoproteins glutathione peroxidase (40Flohe L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 643-722Google Scholar) and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (41Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 42Brigelius-Flohe R. Aumann K.D. Bloker H. Gross G. Kiess M. Kloppel K.D. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Schuckelt R. Usani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7342-7348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can reduce both alkyl hydroperoxides and H2O2. However, glutathione peroxidase is more active toward H2O2, whereas phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase is more specific for lipid hydroperoxides (41Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 43Marinho H.S. Antunes F. Pinto R.E. Free Radicals Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 871-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, only phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase can catalyze the reduction of lipid hydroperoxide derivatives of intact phospholipids. GlutathioneS-transferase isozymes are also able to reduce lipid hydroperoxides with GSH (44Mosialou E. Morgenstern R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 45Hurst R. Bao Y. Jemth P. Mannervick B. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Another pathway for the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides is constituted by NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase (46Bjornstedt M. Hamberg M. Kumar S. Xue J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11761-11764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, an eukaryotic orthologue of prokaryotic AhpC has not been described. We suggest, based on substrate specificity and structural homology, that Ahp1p is a peroxidase and the yeast orthologue of prokaryotic AhpC. Ahp1p is highly similar to C. bondinii PMP20 A and B and to several other fungi and prokaryotic proteins (see Fig. 1 B).C. bondinii PMP20 A and B are two isoforms of a protein identified as the most abundant peroxisomal protein of methanol-exposed cells and suspected to play a role in methanol metabolism (32Garrard L.J. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13929-13937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Goodman J.M. Maher J. Silver P.A. Pacifico A. Sanders D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3464-3468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these two proteins and their fungi and prokaryotic homologues (see Fig. 3 A), which share with Ahp1p the same similarity to the AhpC/TSA family, may have also a peroxidase function. Consistent with this idea is the presence of a C-terminal glutaredoxin domain in the H. influenzae Y572, which may serve as an electron donor for the catalytic cysteine of this putative peroxidase. Based on immunostaining and cellular subfractionation experiments, PMP20 is a peroxisomal protein tightly associated with membranes (33Goodman J.M. Maher J. Silver P.A. Pacifico A. Sanders D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3464-3468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this localization, PMP20 A and B contain a C-terminal peroxisomal sorting signal sequence (32Garrard L.J. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13929-13937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar peroxisomal sorting signal is present in Ahp1p and in the other PMP20-related fungi proteins, suggesting that they may all be similarly localized in peroxisomes. However, the abundance of Ahp1p observed on two-dimensional gels, which only analyze soluble proteins, and its presence in high quantity in the supernatant of a stationary cell culture (data not shown), may indicate that this polypeptide is also present in the cytosol and is shed out of the cell in the medium. A detailed analysis of Ahp1p subcellular location will provide an answer to this question. In summary, AHP1 encodes an AhpC/TSA-related antioxidant with apparent substrate specificity for alkyl hydroperoxides. These data suggest that this antioxidant is a yeast orthologue of prokaryotic AhpC and justifies its name of Ahp1p for yeast alkylhydroperoxide reductase. AHP1 is coordinately controlled with TRX2 and TRR1 by Yap1 and Skn7 and requires the presence of these two enzymes to exertin vivo its antioxidant protective function. In vitro measurements of the antioxidant activity of wild type and Ahp1p cysteine substitution mutants will provide a detailed analysis of its peroxidase function and will confirm the role of the thioredoxin system in supporting the antioxidant activity of Ahp1p. Further studies aimed at analyzing the redox characteristics of Ahp1p and understanding the molecular basis of its substrate specificity will be of interest. In that respect, the propensity of Ahp1p to oxidize to a disulfide-linked homodimer during electrophoresis is quite striking and suggests a high reactivity to oxidation in vitro and probably also in vivo of one or more of its cysteines. We thank Howard Bussey, Steve Moye-Rowley, and Eric Muller for their generous gifts and Kiran Madura for the yeast cDNA library. We also thank Jerome Garin for the identification of the Ahp1p dimer on two-dimensional gels, Gilles Lagniel for technical assistance, and André Sentenac and Raquel Levy-Toledano for critical review of the manuscript."

Current evidence indicate that the chemoelectrical transduction process is mediated by G protein-coupled second messenger cascades. In the present study, attempts were made to identify the G protein subtypes which are activated upon stimulation with urinary pheromonal components.

Experiments using different fractions of urine revealed that upon stimulation with lipophilic volatile odorants, only Gi proteins were activated, whereas Go activation was elicited by α2u-globulin, a major urinary protein, which is a member of the lipocalin superfamily. Since each G protein subtype is stereotypically coexpressed with one of the two structurally different candidate pheromone receptors (V1R and V2R), the results provide the first experimental evidence that V1Rs coexpressed with Gimay be activated by lipophilic probably volatile odorants, whereas V2Rs coexpressed with Go seem to be specialized to interact with pheromonal components of proteinaceous nature.

Whereas the main olfactory system is responsible for the “conventional” sense of smell, the VNO appears to specifically detect pheromones, thereby inducing a distinct social or sexual behavior or endocrine response (1Keverne E.B.

Fertil. 1975; 43: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) urinary substances producing a definite endocrine or behavioral response have been identified. The best characterized non-volatile urinary components in male mouse urine are the “major urinary proteins” (6Clissold P.M. Hainey S. Bishop J.O. Biochem.

Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Although recent structural studies have characterized the naturally bound volatile substances (11Böcskei Z. Groom C.R.

Physiol. 1995; 486: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) suggesting that proteins themselves act as pheromones.The molecular mechanisms responsible for the detection of pheromones and the signal transduction processes in the VNO are not well understood. Initially, it has been suggested that the transduction mechanisms in the VNO would resemble those in the olfactory epithelium, but some of the specific molecular components involved in the transduction of odorants in receptor neurons of the OE, like Golf, adenylyl cylase (AC) subtype III, and the α-subunit of the cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel could not be detected in the neuroepithelium of the VNO (12Berghard A.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 909-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, recent molecular biology advances implicate that neurons in the VNO utilize another set of receptor genes than the olfactory epithelium. Two novel and structurally unrelated multigene families of putative pheromone receptors have been identified (V1R and V2R) which are exclusively expressed in neurons of the VNO (14Dulac C. Axel R. Cell. 1995; 83: 195-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 15Herrada G. Dulac C.

Although receptors of both families represent members of G protein-coupled receptors, the structural differences especially in the N-terminal region led to the concept that each receptor family may be tuned to recognize a distinct class of ligands.Receptors of each family show a distinct nonoverlapping expression pattern within two major laminar zones. Whereas V1Rs are expressed in the apical half of the neuroepithelium, V2Rs are restricted to the basal region of the epithelium. An identical spatial expression pattern has also been observed for two types of G protein α-subunits. Whereas Gi is expressed only in apical neurons, Goexpression is restricted to neurons in the basal half of the VNO neuroepithelium (13Berghard A. Buck L.B. J.

The stereotypical distribution of both receptor families with distinct G protein subtypes implies a linkage between both components.The present study was aimed to characterize the G protein subtypes in the rat vomeronasal organ activated upon stimulation with male urine by performing photoaffinity labeling experiments. Furthermore, antibodies for different G protein subtypes were employed to interfere with the urine-induced IP3 signaling. To evaluate whether there is any correlation between the chemical properties of applied urinary stimuli and the activation of distinct G protein subtypes, stimulation experiments were performed with different fractions of urine as well as with purified α2u-globulin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMale and female adult Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany.

For subcloning into the expression vector pTrcHis, the α2u-globulin sequences from pGEM-T-plasmids were cut out with BamHI andHindIII restriction enzymes and ligated in-frame into the corresponding vector sites. The expression constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3).Growth of Cells and Protein Purification100 ml of LB-medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was inoculated with an overnight culture in the same medium and grown at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced at A 600 of 0.5–0.7 with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, and growth was continued for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and stored on ice for 1 h. For damage of spheroplastes, cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at room temperature. After sonification with a tip sonicator for 2 min on ice, the soluble material was separated from cell debris and inclusion bodies by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and used for affinity chromatography.For purification of His-tagged proteins, the cytosol was loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose column equilibrated against washing buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mmNaCl, and 20 mm imidazole) and washed with 5 column volumes of washing buffer. Subsequently, bound protein was eluted as single peak by increasing the concentration of imidazole to 250 mm. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and protein concentrations were monitored by A 280; corresponding fractions were pooled and dialyzed twice for 8 h against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5.Protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml with 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20. Cleavage of fusion protein was performed by incubation with 1/40 (w/w) enterokinase for 16 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the NaCl concentration was increased to a final concentration of 500 mm, and agarose-coupled soybean trypsin inhibitor was added; after an incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, soybean trypsin inhibitor bound enterokinase was precipitated by centrifugation (2,000 × g for 10 min) and the supernatant was recovered.Preparation of Vomeronasal Organ MembranesMembrane fractions of the VNO were prepared as described previously (23Kroner C. Breer H. Singer A.G. O'Connell J. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 2989-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, VNOs removed from fertile male rats were washed twice in Ringer's solution (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.6 mm K2HPO, 25 mm NaHCO3, 7.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) to remove superficial blood and debris and subsequently frozen in liqiud nitrogen. Each pooled sample (30–60 animals) was thawed on ice, minced, and subsequently subjected to Ringer's solution containing 10 mm calcium chloride; after gently stirring for 10 min at 4 °C, debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min, 3,000 × g), the resulting supernatant was collected and the pellet was resuspended again in Ringer's solution containing CaCl2 as described above. The pooled supernatants containing the membrane fractions were centrifuged again for 30 min at 48,000 × g and the resulting pellet was resuspended in aliquots (100–500 μg in 500 μl) in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) and stored at −70 °C. Olfactory cilia of the OE were obtained using the calcium-shock method as described previously (24Schandar M. Laugwitz K.-L. Boekhoff I. Kroner C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Breer H. J. Biol.

McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4087-4093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was prewarmed at 37 °C with or without odorants. The reaction was started by the addition of 60 μl of VNO membrane preparations, incubated for 2 min at 37 °C and stopped by 7% ice-cold perchloric acid (200 μl) before the concentration of IP3 was determined according to Palmer et al.(26Palmer S. Hughes K.T. Lee D.Y. Wakelma M.J.O. Cell. Signalling. 1989; 1: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To prevent degradation of IP3, stimulation experiments were performed in the presence of 10 mm LiCl (final concentration during incubation). To determine the influence of the subtype-specific G protein α-subunit antisera on the efficiency of urine-induced second messenger responses, membrane preparations of the VNO were preincubated with the indicated dilutions of the specific antisera and subsequently stimulated with urine or purified fractions of urine.Photolabeling of Activated G Proteins[α-32P]GTP azidoanilide was synthesized and purified as described (27Offermanns S. Schultz G. Rosenthal W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 268-301Google Scholar); receptor-dependent G protein labeling was performed as described previously (20Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen VNO membrane preparations in hypotonic buffer were centrifuged (10 min, 12,000 × g, 4 °C) and resuspended in double concentrated labeling buffer (60 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 200 μm EDTA, 500 μm GDP, pH 7.4). 10 μl of urine, general odorants, separated urine fractions (diluted in water), or α2u-globulin (diluted in reaction buffer) were adapted to 37 °C with 20 μl of [α-32-P]GTP azidoanilide (4 × 106 cpm/tube). The reaction was started by adding 30 μl of VNO membrane preparations (1–2 μg/μl); after an incubation period of 2 min at 37 °C the reaction was terminated by cooling the samples to 4 °C. Excess [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide was removed by centrifugation (5 min, 12,000 ×g, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in labeling buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, placed on a Parafilm-coated metal plate (4 °C), and irradiated for 30 s with a 254-nm UV lamp (150 W, Vl-100 Grid-Tube, Herolab GmbH).ImmunoprecipitationPhotolabeled membranes were pelleted and solubilized in 2% (w/v) SDS for 10 min at room temperature before 20 μl/tube of precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% desoxycholate, 1% Tergitol Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4) and 5 μl/tube of the indicated, undiluted subtype-specific G protein α-subunit antisera were added.After 1 h at 4 °C under constant rotation, 60 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (3 mg) was added and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter the Sepharose beads were pelleted (1 min, 12,000 × g, 4 °C) and washed twice with 1 ml of washing buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, 600 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 1% Tergitol Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) and twice with washing buffer B (100 mm Tris/HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Preparation of the samples for SDS-PAGE was performed as described Laugwitz et al. (20Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Incorporated [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide was determined densitometrically after gel-exposure to a PhosphorImager (Fuji).RESULTSBased on a recent study indicating that treatment of vomeronasal organ slice preparations of rats with urine dilutions elicit an increased impulse frequency of sensory neurons which can be blocked by phospholipase C inhibitors (28Inamura K. Kashiwayanagi M. Kurihara K. Chem. Senses. 1997; 22: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we set out to explore whether urine-induced IP3 responses in membrane preparations of VNOs from female rat are mediated by a G protein-controlled reaction cascade. IP3 responses induced upon stimulation with different concentrations of male urine (0.1 to 4%, v/v) were determined in the presence of GTP or GDP. The results in Fig.1 demonstrate that male urine elicited a dose-dependent increase in the formation of IP3; this response was only observed in the presence of GTP indicating that urine-induced phospholipase C activation in the VNO is mediated via G proteins.Immunohistochemical studies (18Halpern M.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 909-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that different G proteins α-subunits (Gs, Gi2, Go, and Gq/11/13) are expressed in neurons of the VNO. Toward an identification of distinct G protein subtypes which are activated upon stimulation with urine, a photoaffinity labeling approach was employed using the photoreactive, hydrolysis resistant [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide (27Offermanns S. Schultz G. Rosenthal W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 268-301Google Scholar, 20Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermanns S.

Female VNO membrane preparations were stimulated with two different concentrations of male urine in the presence of [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide, and subsequently distinct G protein α-subunits were immunoprecipitated (24Schandar M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16669-16677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using subtype-specific antibodies for different G protein α-subtypes (Table I).Fig. 2 shows that urine addition significantly enhanced incorporation of [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide into Gαi as well as Gαosubtypes. Quantification of the labeling intensity indicates that stimulation with male urine (0.2%, v/v) induced a 57% increase in Gαi labeling and a nearly 100% increase in the [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide incorporation into Gαo compared with control samples. In contrast, proteins precipitated with an antiserum specific for Gαs and Gαolf (AS 348) as well as Gαq subtypes (AS 368) show only very weak incorporation of [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide under control conditions, and no increase upon urine stimulation was registered (data not shown).Figure 2Effect of different concentrations of male rat urine on photoaffinity labeling of Gαi and Gαo. Vomeronasal organ preparations of female rat were photolabeled in the absence (control) or presence of two different concentrations of male rat urine indicated in percent v/v. Labeled membranes were solubilized, and immunoprecipitations were performed using either the antibody C-10, specific for Gαi (top panel), or the selective Gαo antibody K-20 (bottom panel). The autoradiograms, showing the 40-kDa regions of a SDS-PAGE, are representative of three independent experiments each giving very similar results. The intensity of labeling, represented as photostimulated luminescence (PSL), was determined densitometrically. Data were calculated as percentage of the basal photostimulated luminescence obtained in the absence of urine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Antibodies for distinct G protein α-subtypes have been successfully used to selectively inhibit ligand-induced phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis (24Schandar M.

Accordingly, membrane preparations of female VNOs from rat were pretreated with different concentrations of subtype-specific antibodies and subsequently stimulated with a 2% (v/v) dilution of male urine. As demonstrated in Fig.3 A, preincubation with the Gαi common antibody C-10 or with the Gαo-specific antibody K-20 attenuated the urine-induced IP3 response in a concentration-dependent manner; 50% inhibition was obtained at a 1:500 dilution of either antibody. In contrast, antibody AS 348 specific for Gαssubtypes as well as AS 368 selective for the Gαqsubfamily did not affect the responsiveness significantly (Fig.3 B). These results indicate that the IP3response in female VNO preparations induced upon stimulation with a complex pheromonal mixture (male urine) is mediated via Gias well as Go proteins.Figure 3Concentration-dependent inhibition of urine-induced IP3 formation by different Gα subtype-specific antibodies. Aliquots of membrane preparations of female VNOs were pretreated with different concentrations of Gα subtype-specific antibodies (A, C-10 for Gαi and K-20 for Gαo; B,AS-368 for Gαq and AS-348 for Gαs) and subsequently samples were stimulated with a 2% (v/v) dilution of male rat urine. The basal level of IP3 in the VNO preparations under control conditions (38.1 ± 6.8 pmol/mg of protein) was not affected upon pretreatment with the different G protein antibodies. The data are calculated as percent of urine–induced IP3formation (57.9 ± 13.0 pmol/mg of protein).

https://openalex.org/W2004417949,"A gene encoding a new GATA factor fromAspergillus nidulans, sreA, was isolated and characterized. SREA displays homology to two fungal regulators of siderophore biosynthesis: about 30% overall identity to SRE fromNeurospora crassa and about 50% identity to URBS1 fromUstilago maydis over a stretch of 200 amino acid residues containing two GATA-type zinc finger motifs and a cysteine-rich region. This putative DNA binding domain, expressed as a fusion protein inEscherichia coli, specifically binds to GATA sequence motifs. Deletion of sreA results in derepression ofl-ornithine-N 5-oxygenase activity and consequently in derepression of the biosynthesis of the hydroxamate siderophore N,N′,N′′-triacetyl fusarinine under sufficient iron supply in A. nidulans. Transcription of sreA is confined to high iron conditions, underscoring the function of SREA as a repressor of siderophore biosynthesis under sufficient iron supply. Nevertheless, overexpression of sreA does not result in repression of siderophore synthesis under low iron conditions, suggesting additional mechanisms involved in this regulatory circuit. Consistent with increased sensitivity to the iron-activated antibiotics phleomycin and streptonigrin, the sreA deletion mutant displays increased accumulation of 59Fe.

These results demonstrate that SREA plays a central role in iron uptake in addition to siderophore biosynthesis. All microorganisms, with the exception of certain lactobacilli that utilize manganese and cobalt as biocatalysts in place of iron, require iron for their growth (1Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The electron transfer ability of the iron atom, modified by diverse ligand environments, makes it essential for redox reactions ranging from respiration to ribonucleotide synthesis. Although iron is the fourth most abundant element in the earth crust, the amount of naturally utilizable iron is very limited for organisms as most of this metal exists in extremely insoluble complexes of ferric hydroxide in nature. On the other hand, excess of free iron in the cell is detrimental, because iron can catalyze the production of cell-damaging hydroxyl radicals in the presence of oxygen. Therefore, the concentration of iron in biological fluids is tightly controlled. Because most species lack an excretory route for iron, control is primarily accomplished by regulating the rate of iron uptake. Thereby, diverse species, from Escherichia coli to human, have developed various and most often multiple iron transport mechanisms. The genus Aspergillus is one of the most ubiquitous microorganisms worldwide and various Aspergillus species are facultative pathogens involved in human infections capable of causing severe diseases like allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma, and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. In particular, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis represents a life-threatening disease of increasing incidence in immunocompromised patients, which has been attributed to increasing iatrogenic immunosuppression and successful life-support measures for neutropenic patients. Because iron is tightly sequestered in mammalian hosts by high affinity iron-binding proteins, microbes require efficient iron-scavenging systems to survive and proliferate within the host. Under conditions of iron starvation, most fungi synthesize and excrete low molecular weight, iron-specific chelators called siderophores, which have therefore often been proposed as virulence factors. Siderophore biosynthesis and its impact on bacterial pathogenicity is well established (1Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In contrast, the knowledge of the biochemical basis for siderophore biosynthesis and its regulation on the molecular level is rather fragmentary in eukaryotic organism. This may be in part because of the fact that the leading model organism for molecular genetic analysis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lacks the ability to synthesize siderophores, although it can utilize siderophores produced by other species (2Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis, a gene encoding a transcriptional repressor of siderophore biosynthesis belonging to the GATA protein family of transcription factors has been characterized (3Voisard C. Wang J. McEvoy J.L. Xu P. Leong S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7091-7100Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Subsequent genetic and molecular studies have shown that URBS1 acts as a transcriptional repressor by direct binding to GATA motifs in the promoter of at least sid1, encodingl-ornithine N 5-oxygenase, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the two Ustilagosiderophores ferrichrome and ferrichrome A (4An Z.

In this study, we report the cloning and characterization ofsreA, a GATA factor-encoding gene responsible for repression of siderophore biosynthesis in Aspergillus nidulans and show its involvement in the control of iron uptake. This study represents a first important step in the investigation of the regulation of siderophore biosynthesis in Aspergilli and provides the basis for evaluation of the impact of iron metabolism on pathogenicity in these fungal species.

High iron medium contained 10 μm FeSO4, and for preparation of low iron medium, addition of FeSO4 was omitted. If required, biotin (20 μg/liter) or l-arginine (200 mg/liter) was added to the media. YAG (2% glucose, 0.5% yeast extract, 2% agar, trace elements) was used as complete medium. Standard molecular techniques were performed as described by Sambrooket al. (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

For expression of the N-terminal SREA zinc finger (NZF), a fragment encoding the SREA amino acids 80–175 was amplified from cDNA employing the primers 5′-TTTTGAATTCGAGACTCCAATGAACG (OSR1) and 5′-TTTTCTGCAGTTAACCTTCGCTTCCAGTA (OSR2), carrying add-on restriction enzyme cleavage sites for EcoRI and PstI. Subsequently, the amplified product was cleaved with EcoRI and PstI and ligated into the respective restriction sites of pMal-cRI (New England Biolabs). After verification of proper integration of the relevant fragment into the plasmid by sequencing, the resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli DH5α. Expression and purification of the maltose-binding protein-NZF fusion protein were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For expression of the C-terminal SREA zinc finger (CZF, amino acid residues 229–315) and the peptide containing both zinc fingers (NCZF, amino acid residues 80–315), the same strategy was employed. For amplification of the CZF-encoding fragment primers, 5′-TTTTGAATTCCCGTCTCCAGAGGCTGA (OSR5) and 5′-TTTTCTGCAGTTAATGGGTAGCAGCAGTC (OSR6) were used, and the NCZF-encoding fragment was amplified employing the primers OSR1 and OSR6.

X. Caddick (University of Liverpool, UK). The resulting plasmid was digested withEcoRI, and the 4.8-kbp fragment was gel-purified before transformation of A. nidulans strain WG355. For overexpression of sreA in A. nidulans, a translational fusion of the sreA-coding region with thegpdA promoter was constructed. Therefore, a 1.8-kbpsreA fragment was amplified from genomic DNA employing primers 5′-TTCTTTGGATCCACTTCTCTTGTCATTGA and 5′-TTCTTTCCATGGTAGCGTCCATCCCGCAC carrying add-on restriction enzyme cleavage sites for NcoI and BamHI, as primers. Subsequently, the amplified product was cleaved withNcoI and BamHI and ligated into the respective restriction sites of pAN52–1 (Ref. 14Punt P.J. Zegers N.D. Busscher M. Pouwels P.H. van den Hondel C.A. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 17: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession number Z32697). pAN52–1 was provided by Dr. P. Punt (TNO, Nutrition and Food Research Institute, The Netherlands). The junctions as well as the coding regions of the fused product were verified by sequencing. The resulting plasmid was co-transformed into A. nidulansWG355, with the argB carrying vector pILJ16. Transformation of A. nidulans was carried out according to Tilburn et al. (15Tilburn J. Sarkar S. Widdick D.A. Espeso E.A. Orejas M. Mungroo J. Penalva M.A. Arst Jr., H.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Screening of positive clones was performed by PCR from fungal colonies. For screening of sreAdisruption strains, the primers Osre, 5′-CGCTAATCCCGCCATCG, and Oarg, 5′-TTCCTCTGCTGCGTCCG, were employed (see Fig. 4). To obtain homokaryotic transformants, colonies from single homokaryotic spores were picked, and genomic integration was analyzed by Southern blot analysis. The siderophore concentration was determined by means of the ferric perchlorate assay, the chrome azurol S liquid assay, and quantitative HPLC analysis (16Payne S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 17Konetschny-Rapp S. Huschka H.G. Winkelmann G. Jung G. Biol. Met. 1988; 1: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For reversed phase HPLC analysis of siderophores according to Konetschny-Rapp et al. (17Konetschny-Rapp S. Huschka H.G. Winkelmann G. Jung G. Biol. Met. 1988; 1: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), siderophores were isolated according to the procedure described for isolation of ferrichrome from Ustilago sphaerogena (16Payne S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Isolated ferric siderophores were photometrically quantified at 435 nm. The siderophores neocoprogen I, neocoprogen II, coprogen, and triacetylfusarinin C used as standards for HPLC analysis were a gift of Dr. G. Winkelmann (Universität Tübingen, Germany). l-ornithine-N 5-oxygenase enzyme activity was determined as already described (7Zhou L. Haas H. Feng B. Marzluf G.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 259: 532-540Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Quantification of resistance/sensitivity of A. nidulans to phleomycin and streptonigrin was performed as described by de Souza et al. (18de Souza C.C. Pellizzon C.H. Hiraishi M. Goldman M.H. Goldman G.H. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 109 conidia of the respective Aspergillus strain were spread onto a YAG plate and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C to produce a nonsporulating mycelial mat. Mycelial “plugs” were cut out from the mats using the wide end of a sterile Pasteur pipette and transferred in three repetitions onto plates containing various drugs or chelators mentioned below and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. The diameters of the resulting colonies were measured, and the radial growth was compared with the average diameter of colonies on zero-dose plates expressed in %. Subsequently, the growth rate of the respective strain was then correlated to that of the A. nidulans wild type. This technique avoids problems of delayed germination and ensures measurement of true exponential-phase growth rate. Drugs were used in YAG with the following concentration: phleomycin (Sigma), 50 μg/ml; streptonigrin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml; benomyl (Sigma), 1 μg/ml; EDTA and bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid, 0.1 mm each. In the case of low iron conditions, minimal medium lacking iron was used, and growth was compared with that on minimal medium containing 10 μm FeSO4. For studying iron uptake, plates containing 50 nCi of 59FeCl3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)/ml of medium were overlaid with a dialysis membrane (Serva, 67 mm). Subsequently, mycelial plugs of the different Aspergillusstrains, prepared as described in Quantification of Resistance/Sensitivity to Drugs (18de Souza C.C. Pellizzon C.H. Hiraishi M. Goldman M.H. Goldman G.H. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), were transferred on top of these dialysis membranes. After incubation for 72 h at 37 °C, the dialysis membranes carrying the fungal colonies were removed from the plates, and the 59Fe content of the colonies was determined using a Phosphor Storage Imaging System, model Storm 840 (Molecular Dynamics). The various members of the GATA protein family are characterized by a high degree of similarity within their DNA binding domain. To isolate thesreP homologous gene from A. nidulans, a PCR-aided strategy similar to the one used for the cloning of the GATA factor-encoding genes sreP and nreB from P. chrysogenum was employed (6Haas H. Angermayr K. Stöffler G. Gene. 1997; 184: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Haas H. Angermayr K. Zadra I. Stöffler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22576-22582Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Using the degenerated primers 5′-ACNCCNYTNTGGMG and 5′–APNCCPCANGCPTTPCA (Y = T or C; M = A or C; N = any nucleotide; P = A or G) derived from the amino acid sequences Thr-Pro-Leu-Trp-Arg and Cys-Asn-Ala-Cys-Gly-Leu, conserved in most fungal GATA factors, a 56-bp fragment was amplified from genomic Aspergillus DNA. The obtained fragments were subcloned into plasmid vectors and sequenced whereby the deduced amino acid sequence of one fragment displayed only a single amino acid exchange compared with the corresponding region of SREP. The encoding fragment was radiolabeled and utilized to probe theAspergillus cosmid library constructed in pWE15 provided by the Fungal Genetic Stock Center (19Brody H. Griffith J. Cuticchia A.J. Arnold J. Timberlake W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3105-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Five hybridizing clones, W04B12, W09A09, W09E09, W10A09, and W10E09, were detected. According to the information made available by the Fungal Genetic Stock Center, the inserts of all five cosmids originate from chromosome VIII, localizingsreA to chromosome VIII as well. Subsequently, a 4.6-kbpEcoRI fragment carrying sreA was subcloned from cosmid W09E09 into pBluescriptKS and sequenced in its entirety. Additionally, 0.4 kbp of the 3′-downstream region of sreAhave been sequenced directly from the cosmid W09E09. The transcription start points and the polyadenylation site of sreA were mapped by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocols according to Frohman et al. (20Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Two major transcription start points were localized 1073 bp and 211 bp upstream of the putative translation start codon. The polyadenylation site was mapped 435 bp downstream of the translation stop codon. Two introns were mapped by amplification of the coding region from mRNA by reverse-transcribed PCR. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences revealed an open reading frame of 1647 bp interrupted by two introns, 55 and 60 bp in length. The 5′ and 3′ borders of the introns as well as the putative lariat formation sites perfectly match the consensus sequences for fungal introns (21Gurr S.J. Uncles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Kinghorn J.R. Gene Structure in Eucaryotic Microbes. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 93-193Google Scholar). The deduced SREA protein displays a calculated mass of 58.8 kDa. Searches in several data bases using the BLAST alignment computer program confirmed that the cloned gene encodes a member of the GATA protein family (38Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar). In contrast to all other identified fungal GATA factors, SREA as well as SREP from P. chrysogenum, SRE from N. crassa, URBS1 from U. maydis, and GAF2p from Schizosaccharomyces pombecontain two zinc fingers (3Voisard C. Wang J. McEvoy J.L. Xu P. Leong S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7091-7100Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 6Haas H. Angermayr K. Stöffler G. Gene. 1997; 184: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Zhou L. Haas H. Feng B. Marzluf G.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 259: 532-540Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Hoe K.L. Won M.S. Yoo O.J. Yoo H.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 127-135PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the sequence homology in these five proteins is not limited to the two zinc finger regions but also extends into the intervening region, where a conserved 27-amino acid residue sequence with four cysteines is present (Fig.1). Moreover, SREA, SREP, and SRE share a common highly conserved C terminus predicted to form a coiled coil structure by computer analysis using the ExPASy tools software package, indicative of a putative protein-protein interaction domain (23Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar). SREA displays the highest overall identity to Penicillium SREP and Neurospora SRE with 61% and 35%, respectively. The positions of the two introns are perfectly conserved in A. nidulans sreA, P. chrysogenum sreP, and N. crassa sre, dating the intron origin before the evolutionary split of the ancestors of these three ascomycetes (6Haas H. Angermayr K. Stöffler G. Gene. 1997; 184: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Zhou L. Haas H. Feng B. Marzluf G.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 259: 532-540Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast,urbs1 from U. maydis and GAF2p fromS. pombe do not contain any introns (3Voisard C. Wang J. McEvoy J.L. Xu P. Leong S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7091-7100Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Hoe K.L. Won M.S. Yoo O.J. Yoo H.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 127-135PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis indicates that expression of sreA is sensitive to the iron content of the medium (Fig. 2). The steady statesreA mRNA levels are significantly elevated in mycelia grown in high iron medium or transferred from low iron medium into high iron medium. In contrast, in mycelia grown in low iron medium or transferred from high iron medium into low iron medium, nosreA transcripts can be detected. In this respect, transcription of sreA differs significantly from that ofUstilago urbs1 and Neurospora sre, where it was found to be constitutive (3Voisard C. Wang J. McEvoy J.L. Xu P. Leong S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7091-7100Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Zhou L. Haas H. Feng B. Marzluf G.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 259: 532-540Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Analogous to the situation in P. chrysogenum, sreA is expressed via two transcripts, 3.2 kb and 2.4 kb in length. Northern blot analysis employing two different hybridization probes, probe A placed in the region between the two major transcription start points and probe B originating from the coding region, proved that the two transcripts are indeed because of different initiations of transcription found by the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure (Fig. 2). GATA factors are defined as GATA-binding proteins that recognize the core motif GATA. To investigate whether sreA in fact encodes a DNA-binding protein, three SREA peptides containing the NZF, the CZF, and both zinc fingers (NCZF), respectively, were expressed as fusion products with the maltose-binding protein in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. In A. nidulans, an SREA-regulated gene has not been isolated so far; therefore, no putative target binding sequence is available. Recently it was shown that NIT-2, WC-1, WC-2, and NGF1, four GATA-factors of N. crassa that are involved in diverse regulatory circuits, bind to the same nucleotide sequence containing GATA motifs, thus displaying little preference for flanking regions (24Feng B. Marzluf G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3983-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, a fragment containing two GATA motifs, which was already shown to bind the Penicillium GATA factor NREB, was employed to test the DNA binding potential of the SREA peptides (10Haas H. Angermayr K. Zadra I. Stöffler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22576-22582Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, both zinc fingers are required for specific DNA binding, at least to the sequence provided, because only NCZF was able to shift the 130-bp DNA fragment (F130). In contrast to the SREA homologous proteins, all other fungal GATA factors identified so far contain only a single zinc finger, which proved to be sufficient for specific DNA binding. On the other hand, the requirement of two GATA-type zinc fingers for recognition of certain DNA sequences has been demonstrated for vertebrate GATA factors: in murine and chicken GATA-1, the C-terminal finger is sufficient for specific DNA binding and certain functionsin vivo, but the N-terminal finger can help to achieve binding specificity and stability, whereby binding to palindromic GATA sites is dependent on the presence of both finger domains (25Visvader J.E. Crossley M. Hill J. Orkin S.H Adams J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 634-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Martin D.I. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 27Trainor C.D. Omichinski J.G. Vandergon T.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28Yang H.Y. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a mutation of the conserved amino acid residue Arg-350 in the N-terminal URBS1 zinc finger does not affect regulation of siderophore biosynthesis in U. maydis, whereby the corresponding mutation in the C-terminal zinc finger abolishes the function of URBS1 (4An Z. Zhao Q. McEvoy J. Yuan W.M. Markley J.L. Leong S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5882-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It cannot be ruled out that the C-terminal finger of SREA might recognize specific DNA sequences on its own, but for recognition of the provided sequence, obviously both fingers are necessary. To investigate the involvement of the two GATA motifs present in F130, 48 bp of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing both GATA motifs as well as mutations of one or both sites were employed in mobility shift analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, the mutation of either single GATA site has no apparent effect on the in vitro binding of NCZF, whereas the mutation of both GATA sites eliminates binding. These results prove that sreA indeed encodes a GATA-binding protein. In comparison, Ustilago URBS1 also specifically binds to a single GATA motif in the sid1 promoter in vitro, but for in vivo function, two clustered sites are necessary (5An Z. Mei B. Yuan W.M. Leong S.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Disruption of sreA was achieved using the 4.6-kbp EcoRI sreA genomic fragment in which the promoter region and the first two exons of sreA were replaced by the argB-encoding gene from A. nidulans (Fig. 4). The resulting 4.8-kbp EcoRI fragment was used to transform anargB − strain of A. nidulans (WG355).Aspergillus argB + /sreA −strains were isolated and characterized by PCR (using primers Osre and Oarg, see Fig. 4). Southern blot analysis proved that thesreA disruption strain, called SRKO1, does not contain the first two sreA exons (probe B) and that these exons are replaced by the argB gene, resulting in a 4.8-kbpEcoRI fragment instead of the original 4.6-kbp fragment (probe C), also confirmed by hybridization with probe D, originating from the third sreA exon (Fig. 4). Moreover, in SRKO1, nosreA transcripts could be detected (Fig. 2). To check if sreA indeed encodes a regulator of siderophore biosynthesis, Aspergillus wild-type and SRKO1 strain were grown in high iron and low iron medium, respectively, and siderophore production was analyzed and quantified by reversed phase HPLC (Fig.5).

The sequence of C2/4GnT encoded a putative type II transmembrane protein with significant sequence similarity to human C2GnT and IGnT. Expression of the secreted form of C2/4GnT in insect cells showed that the gene product had UDP-N-acetyl-α-d-glucosamine:acceptor β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (β1,6GlcNAc-transferase) activity. Analysis of substrate specificity revealed that the enzyme catalyzed O-glycan branch formation of the core 2 and core 4 type. NMR analyses of the product formed with core 3-para-nitrophenyl confirmed the product core 4-para-nitrophenyl. The coding region of C2/4GnT was contained in a single exon and located to chromosome 15q21.3. Northern analysis revealed a restricted expression pattern of C2/4GnT mainly in colon, kidney, pancreas, and small intestine. No expression of C2/4GnT was detected in brain, heart, liver, ovary, placenta, spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes. The expression of core 2O-glycans has been correlated with cell differentiation processes and cancer. The results confirm the predicted existence of a β1,6GlcNAc-transferase that functions in both core 2 and core 4O-glycan branch formation. The redundancy in β1,6GlcNAc-transferases capable of forming core 2O-glycans is important for understanding the mechanisms leading to specific changes in core 2 branching during cell development and malignant transformation.

Mucin-type O-glycosylation is initiated by a large family of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide GalNAc-transferases that add GalNAc to selected Ser and Thr residues (1Clausen H. Bennett E.P.

Elongation and termination of complex oligosaccharide structures involves a large number of glycosyltransferases. Synthesis of the different O-glycan structures is cell- and tissue-specific.

For example, increased formation of GlcNAcβ1–6GalNAc branching inO-glycans has been demonstrated during T-cell activation, during the development of leukemia, and for immunodeficiencies like Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and AIDS (3Piller F.

Blood. 1991; 77: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, many carcinomas show changes from complex O-glycans found in normal cell types to immaturely processed simple mucin-typeO-glycans such as T (Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen; Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-R), Tn (GalNAcα1-R), and sialosyl-Tn (NeuAcα2–6GalNAcα1-R) (see Fig. 1) (11Springer G.F. Science. 1984; 224: 1198-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this has been extensively studied in breast cancer, where it was shown that specific down-regulation of core 2 β6GlcNAc-transferase was responsible for the observed lack of complex type O-glycans on the mucin MUC1 (7Brockhausen I. Yang J.M. Burchell J. Whitehouse C. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the metastatic potential of tumors has been correlated with increased expression of core 2 β6GlcNAc-transferase activity (6Fukuda M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2237-2244PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in core 2 β6GlcNAc-transferase activity was associated with increased levels of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains carrying sialyl-Lex, which may contribute to tumor metastasis by altering selectin-mediated adhesion (5Yousefi S.

The control ofO-glycan core assembly is regulated by the expression of key enzyme activities outlined in Fig. 1; however, epigenetic factors including post-translational modification, topology, or competition for substrates may also play a role in this process (13Paulson J.C.

Human C2GnT was identified by a transfection cloning strategy, and it shows similarity to another β6GlcNAc-transferase (IGnT) that is responsible for poly-N-acetyllactosamine branching (22Bierhuizen M.F. Mattei M.G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, these two genes were not similar in sequence to GnTV, which is responsible for formation of the β6GlcNAc branch in tetraantennaryN-linked glycans (23Shoreibah M. Perng G.S. Adler B.

Studies of the kinetic properties and acceptor substrate specificities of β6GlcNAc-transferases involved inO-glycosylation from different cell lines and organs have suggested that multiple β6GlcNAc-transferases exist and that one of these would function in a manner that is distinct from the cloned C2GnT enzyme, in being capable of forming core 2, core 4, and possibly the branched I antigen structure (17Brockhausen I. Matta K.L. Orr J. Schachter H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1866-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Brockhausen I. Matta K.L. Orr J. Schachter H. Koenderman A.H. van den Eijnden D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The existence of a homologous β6GlcNAc-transferase family containing C2GnT and IGnT suggests that additional β6GlcNAc-transferase activities may be encoded by homologous genes (22Bierhuizen M.F. Mattei M.G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, similar genes for large families of galactosyltransferases (24Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol.

This report describes the use of this strategy for identification of a novel member of the β6GlcNAc-transferase family that forms core 2 as well as core 4 structures. The BLASTn and tBLASTn were used with the reported coding sequence of human C2GnT (GenBankTMaccession number M97347) to search the dbEST data base at The National Center for Biotechnology Information as described previously (24Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31979-31991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Human EST and genomic bovine sequences similar but not identical to known members of the β6GlcNAc-transferase family were identified. EST clone 178656 (5′ EST GenBankTM accession number AA307800), derived from a putative homologue to C2GnT, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Sequencing of this clone revealed a partial open reading frame with significant sequence similarity to C2GnT. The coding region of human C2GnT and a bovine homologue was previously found to be organized in one exon (27Bierhuizen M.F. Maemura K. Kudo S. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 3T. Schwientek and H. Clausen, unpublished observations. Because the 5′ and 3′ sequence available from the C2/4GnT EST was incomplete but likely to be located in a single exon, the missing 5′ and 3′ portions of the open reading frame were obtained by sequencing genomic P1 clones. P1 clones were obtained from a human foreskin genomic P1 library (DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. Human Foreskin Fibroblast P1 Library) by screening with the primer pair TSHC27 (5′-GGAAGTTCATACAGTTCCCAC-3′) and TSHC28 (5′-CCTCCCATTCAACATCTTGAG-3′). Two genomic clones for C2/4GnT, DPMC-HFF#1–1026(E2) and DPMC-HFF#1–1091(F1), were obtained from Genome Systems Inc. DNA from P1 phage was prepared as recommended by Genome Systems Inc. The entire coding sequence of the C2/4GnT gene was represented in both clones and sequenced in full using automated sequencing (ABI377, Perkin-Elmer). Confirmatory sequencing was performed on a cDNA clone obtained by PCR (30 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 68 °C for 2 min 30 s) on total cDNA from the human COLO 205 cancer cell line with the sense primer TSHC 54 (5′-GCAGAATTCATGGTTCAATGGAAGAGACTC-3′) and the antisense primer TSHC 45 (5′-AGCGAATTCAGCTCAAAGTTCAGTCCCATAG-3′). The composite sequence contained an open reading frame of 1314 base pairs encoding a putative protein of 438 amino acids with type II domain structure predicted by the TMpred-algorithm at the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research. 4The website at the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research ishttp://www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/software/TMPRED_form.html). The sequence of the 5′ end of C2/4GnT mRNA including the translational start site and 5′-UTR was obtained by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (35 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 52 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 2 min) using total cDNA from the human COLO 205 cancer cell line with the antisense primer TSHC 48 (5′-GTGGGAACTGTATGAACTTCC-3′) (see Fig. 2). An expression construct designed to encode amino acid residues 31–438 of C2/4GnT was prepared by PCR using P1 DNA and the primer pair TSHC55 (5′-CGAGAATTCAGGTTGAAGTGTGACTC-3′) and TSHC45 (see Fig. 2). The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI site of pAcGP67A (PharMingen), and the insert was fully sequenced. An expression construct encoding amino acid residues 40–428 of human C2GnT was prepared by PCR on genomic DNA of a healthy male blood donor using the primer pair EBCT1 (5′-AGCGGATCCTTTGTAAGTGTCAGACACTTGGAG-3′) and EBCT2 (5′-AGCGGATCCAAAATTGCCCGTAATGGTCAGTG-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI site of pAcGP67B (PharMingen), and the sequence was found to be identical to the sequence originally reported by Bierhuizen and Fukuda (21Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Plasmids pAcGP67-C2/4GnT-sol and pAcGP67-C2GnT-sol were co-transfected with Baculo-GoldTMDNA (PharMingen) as described previously (24Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H.

Recombinant Baculo-virus were obtained after two successive amplifications in Sf9 cells grown in serum-containing medium, and titers of virus were estimated by titration in 24-well plates with monitoring of enzyme activities. Controls included the pAcGP67-GalNAc-T3-sol (28Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The kinetic properties were determined with partially purified enzymes expressed in High FiveTM cells. Partial purification was performed by consecutive chromatography on Amberlite IRA-95, DEAE-Sephacryl, and CM-Sepharose essentially as described (29Wandall H.H. Hassan H. Mirgorodskaya E. Kristensen A.K. Roepstorff P. Bennett E.P. Nielsen P.A. Hollingsworth M.A. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23503-23514Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad reagent with bovine serum albumin as standard protein. Standard assays were performed using culture supernatant from infected cells in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 100 mm MES (pH 8.0 for C2/4GnT and pH 7.0 for C2GnT), 10 mm (C2/4GnT) or 5 mm EDTA (C2GnT), 10 mm2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucono-1,5-lacton, 180 μm UDP-[14C]-GlcNAc (6,000 cpm/nmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the indicated concentrations of acceptor substrates (Sigma and Toronto Research Laboratories Ltd.; see Table I for structures). Semi-purified C2GnT and C2/4GnT were assayed in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 100 mm MES (pH 7), 5 mm (C2/4GnT) or 2 mm EDTA (C2GnT), 1 mm dithiothreitol (C2GnT), 90 μmUDP-[14C]-GlcNAc (3,050 cpm/nmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the indicated concentrations of acceptor substrates. Reaction products were quantified by chromatography on Dowex AG1-X8. Complete glycosylation of core3-pNph was performed in a reaction mixture consisting of 6.9 milliunits C2/4GnT (specific activity determined with core1-pNph), 2 mg core3-pNph, 100 mm MES (pH 7.0), 5 mm EDTA, 4.6 μmol UDP-GlcNAc, and 100 milliunits alkaline phosphatase in a final volume of 200 μl. The glycosylation of core3-pNph was monitored by thin layer chromatography and run for 8 h until completed. The reaction product was purified on an octadecyl-silica cartridge (Bakerbond; J. T. Baker), deuterium exchanged by repeated lyophilization from D2O and then dissolved in 0.5 ml of D2O for NMR analysis. One-dimensional 1H NMR, two-dimensional1H-1H TOCSY (30Braunschweiler L.

Hollingsworth M.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4744-4748PubMed Google Scholar). 25 μg of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% denaturing agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (38Sutherlin M.E.

The cDNA fragment of soluble C2/4GnT was used as a probe for hybridization. The probe was random primer-labeled using [α32P]dCTP and an oligonucleotide labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was probed overnight at 42 °C as described previously (28Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and washed twice for 30 min each at 42 °C with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and twice for 30 min each at 52 °C with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Human multiple tissue Northern blots, MTN I and MTN II (CLONTECH), were probed as described above and washed twice for 10 min each at room temperature with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS; twice for 10 min each at 55 °C with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS; and once for 10 min with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Fluorescence in situhybridization was performed on normal human lymphocyte metaphase chromosomes using procedures described previously (24Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H.

For evaluation of the chromosomal slides a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters for visualization of fluorescein isothiocyanate was used. Hybridization signals and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-counterstained chromosomes were transformed into pseudo-colored images using image analysis software. For precise localization and chromosome identification 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-converted banding patterns were generated using the BDS-imageTM software package (ONCOR). Analysis of the GenBankTM and dbEST data bases suggested the existence of additional members of the β6GlcNAc-transferase family. EST clones encoding the putative enzymes were obtained, and the full coding sequence of a novel gene with significant sequence similarity to human C2GnT (21Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and blood group IGnT (22Bierhuizen M.F. Mattei M.G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and analysis of P1 DNA. The sequence encoded a type II transmembrane protein of 438 amino acids with an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 9 residues, a transmembrane segment of 18 residues, a stem region, and catalytic domain of 411 residues with two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig.2). A Kyte and Doolittle (39Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar) hydropathy plot of C2/4GnT showed similarity to C2GnT and indicated that the putative stem region was hydrophilic, similar to other Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases (data not shown). The cloned cDNA included a single initiation codon according to the Kozak rule (40Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR of 510 base pairs was confirmed in additional EST clones and contains a polyadenylation signal at base pair 1749 (+435) (Fig. 2). A multiple sequence alignment (ClustalW) of three human β6GlcNAc-transferases is shown in Fig.3. C2/C4GnT shows a higher overall amino acid sequence identity to human C2GnT (52%) than to human IGnT (41%). Sequence similarities among the three human proteins are found predominantly in the putative catalytic domains, and no significant sequence similarities were detected in the N-terminal regions. Eight cysteine residues are conserved in all three β6GlcNAc-transferases; a ninth cysteine residue in the N-terminal region of C2GnT and C2/C4GnT was not found in IGnT (Fig. 3). N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence sites are not generally conserved in homologous as well as orthologous glycosyltransferases, although one site is conserved in the central region of four β3Gal-transferases (25Amado M. Almeida R. Carneiro F. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Nomoto M. Hollingsworth M.A. Hassan H. Schwientek T. Nielsen P.A. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol.

Interestingly, a single potentialN-linked site located in the stem region of C2/4GnT, C2GnT and IGnT is conserved (Fig. 3). The two N-glycosylation sites found in C2GnT are utilized, and the N-Glycan in the conserved position was shown to be essential for function of the recombinant enzyme (42Toki D. Sarkar M. Yip B. Reck F. Joziasse D. Fukuda M. Schachter H. Brockhausen I. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The coding region of the human C2/4GnT gene was found to be organized in a single exon, similar to the genomic structure of the human C2GnT gene (27Bierhuizen M.F. Maemura K. Kudo S. Fukuda M.

Recently, the c-ski gene product (c-Ski) was found to bind to N-CoR (nuclear hormone receptor co-repressor), an element implicated in transcriptional repression mediated by multiple transcriptional repressors including the nuclear hormone receptors and Mad. c-Ski is required for transcriptional repression mediated by Mad involved in negative regulation of cellular proliferation. v-Ski abrogates Mad-induced transcriptional repression in a dominant negative fashion. Here we report that v-Ski also inhibits transcriptional repression mediated by Rb, another tumor suppressor gene product.

Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). N-CoR was originally identified as a co-repressor that binds to and mediates transcriptional repression by nuclear hormone receptors (8Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B.

Another co-repressor, SMRT, shows striking homology to N-CoR (9Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). N-CoR also forms a complex with mammalian Sin3 orthologues (mSin3A and mSin3B). The binding of mSins to histone deacetylase (HDAC) suggested that transcriptional repression through N-CoR involves deacetylation of nucleosomal histones (10Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.-M.

We demonstrated that N-CoR binds to the N-terminal region of c-Ski and that this interaction is also required for transcriptional repression mediated by Mad and the thyroid hormone receptor β (28Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The same target sequence of Mad/Max, the so-called E-box, is also recognized by a heterodimer of Myc/Max that activates transcription. It is believed that Myc/Max enhances cellular proliferation or transformation, whereas Mad/Max leads to suppression of proliferation or induction of terminal differentiation in a wide range of cell types (16Ayer D.E.

Rb regulates the G1/S transition in the cell cycle by silencing a group of target genes regulated by E2F transcription factors (21Weinberg R.A.

Rb binds to the activation domain of E2F and then actively represses the promoter by recruiting HDAC. The pocket region of Rb, which contains two subdomains, termed A and B, are responsible for interaction with HDAC (18Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 19Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S. Le Villain J.P. Troalen F. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A.

Although HDAC forms a complex with mSin3, N-CoR, and Ski, it remains unknown whether Rb can form a complex with any of these components of the N-CoR complex. To understand the molecular mechanism of transformation by v-Ski, we examined whether c-Ski forms a complex with Rb and whether v-Ski abrogates Rb-induced transcriptional activation as in the case of Mad. Our results indicate that c-Ski is needed for the transcriptional repression mediated by Rb and that v-Ski abrogates Rb-induced transcriptional repression. HeLa cells were lysed in lysis buffer consisting of PBS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim). CV-1 cells were lysed in lysis buffer consisting of PBS, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim). Lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-c-Ski monoclonal antibodies (28Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), anti-Sno monoclonal antibodies, anti-Rb antibody G3-245 or XZ91 (Pharmingen), anti-Gal4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), or control IgG, and the immune complex was analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-Rb, anti-N-CoR (28Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), anti-c-Ski, anti-mSin3A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), or anti-HDAC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) antibodies and ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-c-Ski and anti-Sno monoclonal antibodies were prepared using bacterially expressed full-length c-Ski and Sno proteins, respectively. To examine the effect of v-Ski on complex formation among Rb, HDAC1, and Ski, CV-1 cells were transfected with a mixture of 1 μg of the c-Ski or v-Ski expression plasmid, 3 μg of the Gal4-Rb expression plasmid, and 1 μg of the HDAC1 expression plasmid using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies Inc.). The plasmid to express Gal4-Rb containing the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (amino acids 1–174) and the repressor domain of Rb (amino acids 379–792) was constructed using the cytomegalovirus promoter-containing vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The HDAC1 expression plasmid was constructed using pcDNA3, and the c-Ski and v-Ski expression plasmids were described (28Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated using anti-Gal4 antibody (UBI) or control IgG as described above, and the immune complex was analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-HDAC1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). To express the GST-Rb fusion protein containing the pocket region of human Rb (amino acids 372–787) inEscherichia coli, a plasmid was constructed by the polymerase chain reaction-based method using the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The modified pSP65 vector pSPUTK (Stratagene) was used for in vitro transcription/translation of the various forms of Rb and c-Ski. The various deletion mutants of c-Ski have been described previously (28Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and the Rb deletion mutants were constructed using appropriate enzyme sites. The Rb mutants contained deletions of one of the following regions; ΔB (amino acids 600–928), ΔA (amino acids 302–600), ΔA + B (amino acids 414–928), or A + B (amino acids 1–371 and amino acids 789–928). The preparation of GST fusion proteins, the in vitro translation of various forms of Rb and c-Ski, and the binding assays were done essentially as described (28Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) except for the use of a binding buffer consisting of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 0.1 m KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and the use of PBS for washing. The antibody injection experiments using the Gal4-Rb expression plasmid and the anti-c-Ski and anti-Sno polyclonal antibodies were performed as described (28Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of v-Ski on Gal4-Rb-mediated transcriptional repression, a mixture of 3 μg of the Gal site-containing luciferase reporter, 0.02 μg of Gal4-Rb or the Gal4 expression plasmid, and 1, 2, or 3 μg of the plasmid to express c-Ski or v-Ski and 0.5 μg of internal control plasmid pRL-TK was transfected into CV-1 cells using the CaPO4 method, and luciferase assays were performed. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 15 μg by addition of the control plasmid DNA lacking the cDNA. To examine the effect of Ski on E2F-dependent transcriptional activation, a mixture of 0.1 μg of the E2F1 site-containing luciferase reporter, 0.05 μg of the E2F1 expression plasmid or the control DNA, and 1.5, 2, or 2.5 μg of the v-Ski expression plasmid and 0.1 μg of the internal control plasmid pRL-TK was transfected into CV-1 cells using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and luciferase assays were performed. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 3 μg by addition of the control plasmid DNA lacking the cDNA. The E2F site-containing reporter was described previously (23Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The pcDNA1 vector (Invitrogen) containing the cytomegalovirus promoter was used to express E2F1. To investigate whether Rb forms a complex with c-Ski in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed (Fig.1 A). The cell lysates were prepared from HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Ski, anti-Sno, or control anti-Gal4 antibody. Rb was co-precipitated with anti-c-Ski or anti-Sno antibodies but not with the control anti-Gal4 antibody. To examine complex formation between the endogenous Rb protein and mSin3A, co-immunoprecipitation was performed using CV-1 cells. The anti-Rb antibody XZ91 co-immunoprecipitated mSin3A, whereas the anti-Rb antibody G3-245 or control IgG did not (Fig.1 B). These results indicate that Rb forms a complex in vivo not only with HDAC but also with c-Ski and mSin3A. We could not detect N-CoR or SMRT in the complex immunoprecipitated with anti-Rb antibodies (data not shown). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this is due to the low level of expression of N-CoR and SMRT in HeLa and CV-1 cells. To examine whether expression of v-Ski results in loss of HDAC in the Rb-HDAC complex, we performed the co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 1 C). CV-1 cells were transfected with a mixture of the c-Ski or v-Ski expression plasmid together with the plasmids to express HDAC1 and the Gal4-Rb fusion protein made up of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and the pocket region of Rb. The cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-Gal4 or control IgG antibody. The amount of HDAC1 coprecipitated with Gal4-Rb in the presence of v-Ski was apparently less than that with c-Ski. These results suggest that v-Ski inhibits association between Rb and HDAC1 in a dominant negative fashion. During the analysis of the interaction between Rb and the components of the N-CoR complex, we found that c-Ski directly binds to Rb in vitro. In the GST pull-down assays using in vitrotranslated Rb and the GST-c-Ski resin containing full-length c-Ski, a significant amount of in vitro translated Rb was found to bind to the GST-c-Ski resin (Fig.2 A). The results of binding assays using the different mutants of Rb indicated that the B subdomain in the pocket region of Rb is responsible for the interaction with c-Ski. To identify the region in c-Ski that interacts with Rb, the GST pull-down assay was performed using the GST-Rb fusion protein resin and various forms of in vitro translated c-Ski protein (Fig.2 B). The results indicated that two regions in c-Ski efficiently interact with Rb; one is the region between amino acids 197 and 330, which includes a part of the N-CoR-binding domain (amino acids 99–274) and the other is the C-terminal coiled-coil region (amino acids 556–728). Thus, Rb directly binds to c-Ski and HDAC. To further investigate whether c-Ski is required for transcriptional repression by Rb, antibody injection experiments were done (Fig.3). Injection into Rat-1 cells of alacZ reporter plasmid containing the lacZ gene linked to the TK promoter and Gal4-binding sites gave rise to manylacZ-positive cells. Co-injection of this lacZreporter with a plasmid encoding the Gal4-Rb fusion protein made up of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and the pocket region of Rb resulted in a decrease in the number of lacZ-positive cells. This decrease was relieved significantly by co-injection of anti-c-Ski antibody and partially by anti-Sno antibodies. Co-injection of both antibodies also significantly relieved the decrease in the number oflacZ-positive cells, but not completely. The incomplete abrogation of Gal-Rb function by co-injection of both antibodies may be due to the presence of other Ski-related protein(s) such as the third member of the ski gene family which we identified recently. 2M. M. Khan, T. Nomura, and S. Ishii, unpublished data. As a control experiment, we used a Gal4 fusion protein containing the repressor domain of δEF1, which is thought not to utilize the N-CoR c-Ski complex. Co-injection of anti-c-Ski or anti-Sno antibodies did not alleviate the decrease in the number of lacZ-positive cells induced by Gal4-δEF1 (28Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the effect of anti-Ski/Sno antibodies was specific for Rb. To investigate whether v-Ski mutants that lack the C-terminal region of c-Ski could abrogate transcriptional repression by Rb in a dominant negative fashion as in the case of Mad, we examined the effect of overexpression of v-Ski on Gal4-Rb-induced transcriptional repression (Fig. 4, A and B). Gal4-Rb containing the pocket region of Rb strongly repressed transcription from the Gal4 site-containing reporter. This Gal4-Rb-induced repression was abrogated by v-Ski in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, wild type c-Ski partly abrogated Gal4-Rb-induced transcriptional repression. We observed that the microspeckle pattern of N-CoR was disrupted by coexpression of a high amount of c-Ski but not by a low amount of c-Ski. 3T. Nomura and S. Ishii, unpublished data. These two observations are consistent with the idea that overexpression of wild type c-Ski abrogates transcriptional repression by creating an imbalance between the components of the co-repressor complex rather than potentiating transcriptional repression. In control experiments, repression by the Gal4-δEF1 fusion protein was not abolished by co-expression of either v-Ski or wild type c-Ski (28Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Using the E2F1 site-containing luciferase reporter, we also examined the effect of v-Ski on E2F1-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 4 C). v-Ski was also found to enhance E2F1-induced transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that v-Ski inhibits Rb-dependent transcriptional repression. The oncogene v-ski can transform chicken embryo fibroblasts. Our results indicate that v-Ski abrogates transcriptional repression mediated not only by Mad but also by Rb. c-Ski has two regions that are conserved in related proteins, the N-terminal cysteine-rich region and the C-terminal coiled-coil region. N-CoR binds to the N-terminal cysteine-rich region, while the C-terminal coiled-coil region binds to mSin3 (28Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The C-truncated c-Ski protein lacking the coiled-coil region cannot bind to mSin3 and disrupts the dot-like structure of N-CoR (28Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this form of c-Ski acts as in a dominant negative fashion. Because v-Ski also lacks the C-terminal coiled-coil region, v-Ski probably inhibits Mad- and Rb-mediated transcriptional repression in a dominant negative fashion. In our co-transfection assay, overexpression of normal c-Ski also partly abrogated the transcriptional repression mediated by Rb (Fig.4). This is consistent with the fact that overexpression of wild type c-Ski also leads to transformation (24Colmenares C. Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Stavnezer E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4929-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the human Rb gene occurs in a wide variety of tumors (25Goodrich D.W. Lee W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, one of themad-related genes, mxi1, was recently demonstrated to act as a tumor suppressor using mutant mice (26Schreiber-Agus N. Meng Y. Hoang T. Hou Jr., H. Chen K. Greenberg R. Cordon-Cardo C. Lee H.-W. DePinho R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, abrogation of Rb and Mad activity by v-Ski may contribute, at least partly, to transformation by v-ski. Rb was recently reported to directly bind to HDAC (18Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 19Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S.

Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Rb also directly interacts with c-Ski. Furthermore, Rb forms a complex with mSin3, although it is not clear whether the Rb-HDAC-mSin3A-Ski complex contains N-CoR. The antibody injection experiments showed that c-Ski is required for Rb-mediated transcriptional repression (Fig. 3). At present, it remains unknown whether N-CoR and mSin3 are needed for the transcriptional repression mediated by Rb. Thus, c-Ski is required for the transcriptional repression mediated by at least Mad, thyroid receptor, and Rb. It is possible that other transcriptional repressors that utilize the N-CoR-mSin3-HDAC complex also require c-Ski. The complex containing mSin3 consists of multiple proteins such as SAP30 and the histone-binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48 (27Zhang Y. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Cell. 1997; 89: 357-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SAP30 is required for the transcriptional repression mediated by the estrogen receptor but not by thyroid receptor or the retinoic acid receptor (7Laherty C.D. Billin A.N. Lavinsky R.M. Yochum G.S. Bush A.C. Sun J.-M. Mullen T.-M. Davie J.R. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism of v-Ski-induced transformation, it will be important to determine whether c-Ski acts in specific transcriptional repression mediated by a limited number of repressors or in transcriptional repression in general.

Fat1p, has homology to a rat peroxisomal very long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase. Very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity is reduced in strains containing a disrupted FAT1 gene and is increased when FAT1is expressed in insect cells under control of a baculovirus promoter. Fat1p accounts for approximately 90% of the C24-specific acyl-CoA synthetase activity in glucose-grown cells and approximately 66% of the total activity in cells grown under peroxisomal induction conditions. Localization of functional Fat1p:green fluorescent protein gene fusions and subcellular fractionation of C24 acyl-CoA synthetase activities indicate that the majority of Fat1p is located in internal cellular locations. Disruption of the FAT1 gene results in the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in the sphingolipid and phospholipid fractions. This includes a 10-fold increase in C24 acids and a 6-fold increase in C22 acids. These abnormal accumulations are further increased by perturbation of very long chain fatty acid synthesis. Overexpression of Elo2p, a component of the fatty acid elongation system, in fat1Δ cells causes C20–C26 levels to rise to approximately 20% of the total fatty acids. These data suggest that Fat1p is involved in the maintenance of cellular very long chain fatty acid levels, apparently by facilitating β-oxidation of excess intermediate length (C20–C24) species. Althoughfat1Δ cells were reported to grow poorly in oleic acid-supplemented medium when fatty acid synthase activity is inactivated by cerulenin, fatty acid import is not significantly affected in cells containing disrupted alleles of FAT1 andFAS2 (a subunit of fatty acid synthase). These results suggest that the primary cause of the growth-defective phenotype is a failure to metabolize the incorporated fatty acid rather than a defect in fatty acid transport. Certain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase activities, however, do appear to be essential for bulk fatty acid transport inSaccharomyces.

Most of the very long chain fatty acids found in yeast are 26:0 2Fatty acids are denoted by a standard designation that indicates the number of carbons followed by the number of double bonds (e.g. 26:0, hexacosanoic acid, a 26-carbon fatty acid with no double bonds; 18:2, linoleic acid, an 18-carbon fatty acid with two double bonds). and hydroxy-26:0. C20–C24 VLCFAs are minor sphingolipid components that are apparently derived from metabolic intermediates in the formation of the 26-carbon species. Our laboratory has recently found two genes, ELO2 and ELO3, that are involved in very long chain fatty acid synthesis (1Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Each gene apparently encodes a single component of a system that elongates C16 and C18 acids to C20–C26 VLCFAs. Elo2p is involved in the elongation of fatty acids up to 24 carbons. Elo3p apparently has a broader substrate specificity and is essential for the conversion of 24-carbon acids to 26-carbon species (1Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol.

A characteristic of human X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is an absence or reduction of very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLACS) activity, which leads to the accumulation of saturated VLCFAs. This appears to be caused by the mutations in the X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy gene, which encodes the ABC transporter in peroxisomal membranes (2Mosser J. Douar A.M. Sarde C.O. Kioschis P. Feil R.

Pharmacother. 1994; 48: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The function of the adrenoleukodystrophy protein is not clearly explained but might be involved in the transport of VLCFAs into peroxisomes or in the transport of proteins that are required for the β-oxidation of VLCFAs. β-Oxidation of VLCFAs in yeast and mammals is known to occur primarily in peroxisomes (4Singh H. Derwas N. Poulos A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 5Kalish J.E. Chen C.I. Gould S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The formation of CoA thioesters from VLCFAs is an initial step for β-oxidation and is catalyzed by a VLACS. A VLACS was recently purified from the rat liver peroxisomal membranes and microsomes, leading to the identification of its gene (6Uchida Y. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,7Uchiyama A. Aoyama T. Kamijo K. Uchida Y. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30360-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA synthetase activity is required for the biosynthesis and the catabolic oxidation of fatty acids. Previous studies have identified four fatty acyl-CoA synthetases in Saccharomyces that appear to be involved in the metabolism of long chain (C12–C18) fatty acids (8Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10861-10867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We had previously determined that the two major synthetase activities, encoded by the FAA1 and FAA4 genes, were not essential for VLCFA synthesis and that disruption of either or both genes did not affect VLCFA composition. Given the important role of acyl-CoA synthetase activity in the biosynthesis and metabolism of VLCFAs, we attempted to identify a yeast VLACS homologue by data base searching. The amino acid sequence of open reading frame YBR041W was found to be homologous to that of the rat VLACS. Previously, YBR041W had been designated as FAT1 and was proposed to function in long chain fatty acid transport (10Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the protein encoded by the YBR041W sequence is a functional homolog for the rat VLACS and that disruption of the gene can cause large accumulations of aberrant, C20–C24 VLCFAs, suggesting that Fat1p plays an important role in controlling cellular VLCFA levels. Bulk fatty acid transport does not appear to be affected by the loss of Fat1p activity; however, given its multiplicity of cellular locations, it could also play a significant role in the uptake of low levels of nutrient fatty acids. In examining the role of fatty acyl-CoA synthetases in fatty acid import, however, we identified two fatty acyl-CoA synthetases, Faa1p and Faa4p, that are essential for the bulk import of nutrient fatty acids. Yeast strains constructed for this study and their genotypes are presented in Table I. Strains containingfaa1Δ, faa4Δ, and faa1Δ/faa4Δgene disruptions were obtained from J. Gordon and were previously described (11Choi J.Y. Stukey J. Hwang S.Y. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3581-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Plasmids constructed for this study are shown in TableII. Standard yeast genetics methods were used for construction of strains bearing the appropriate mutations. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in YPAD (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, and 2 mg/liter adenine), YPADt (YPAD plus 1% tergitol nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 (to disperse fatty acids), CM (complete synthetic medium (12Ausubel F.M.

Tergitol is used in the medium to disperse fatty acids. Unlike Brij and Tween compounds, which are derived from fatty alcohols or fatty acids, tergitol is a nonylphenol polyethylene oxide polymer that is apparently not metabolized. Alternative carbon sources (2% galactose; 2% raffinose; or 3% glycerol, 0.1% (3.54 mm) oleic acid, 0.25% Tween 40) were used by replacing glucose in appropriate media. Fatty acids were obtained from Sigma or Nu-Chek Prep (Elysian, MN).

A linear faa2Δ::URA3 sequence was also transformed into the fat1Δ::LEU2 strain andfat1Δ::LEU2/fat2Δ::HIS3 to create the fat1Δ/faa2Δ double disruption stain and thefat1Δ/fat2Δ/faa2Δ triple disruption strain. 2.3 kb of DNA sequence containing FAT1 coding sequence and 3′-untranslated region was released by BamHI and HpaI digestion of the pCRSK-FAT1 (Table II). This element was inserted into the linearized and blunt ended YCpGAL1URA vector by BamHI, HindIIIj, and Klenow enzyme digestion to create vector pFAT1. That vector was transformed intofat1Δ::LEU2 strains, and transformants were selected on CM plates without uracil and leucine. Protein coding elements of the FAT1 gene were fused in frame to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequences by insertion into centromeric plasmid vectors pTS395 and pTS408. These contain the GFP sequence linked to the GAL1 promoter and the 3′ terminator sequence from the ACT1 gene. Vector pTS395 was used to fuse GFP to the C terminus, and vector pTS495 was used to fuse GFP to the N terminus of Fat1p. To create vector pTS395FAT1, a DNA sequence containing codons 1–669 of the FAT1 coding sequence was derived from PCR using DTY10a genomic DNA as templates and primers 5′-ATAGGATCCATGTCTCCCATACATGTTGTTGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCTAGATAATTTAATTGTTTGTGCATCG-3′ (reverse). To create the vector pTS408FAT1 construct, a DNA sequence containing the same codons was derived from DTY10a genomic DNA and primers 5′-ATAGGATCCATGTCTCCCATACATGTTGTTGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCTAGACTATAATTTAATTGTTTGTGCATCG-3′ (reverse). The amplified PCR products were cut with BamHI and XbaI and inserted to vectors digested with the same restriction enzymes. To induce expression the FAT1-GFP fusion gene under control of the GAL1 promoter, fat1Δ strains harboring GFP fusion vectors were grown overnight in 5 ml of uracil and leucine drop-out CM containing 2% raffinose. Cells were induced for 4 h by resuspension in the same media containing 2% galactose. For oleic acid and galactose induction, cells were grown overnight in uracil and leucine drop-out CM containing 3% glycerol and induced for 4 h in the same medium containing 2% galactose, 0.1% oleic acid, 0.25% Tween 40. One μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was added to the media during the last 1.5 h of galactose induction. After induction, cells were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.4) three times and then resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline buffer. In a humid chamber, cells were dropped onto a Superfrost Plus slide (25 × 75 × 1 mm; VWR Scientific) and allowed to settle for 10 min. Excess cells were flushed from the slides with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline buffer and mounted in 0.1% sea plaque agar under a coverslip. All samples were viewed on a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope equipped with a Chroma Endow GFP filter set 41017 (excite HQ470/40; emitter HQ525/50; beam splitter Q495 LP). Images were captured using the Acquire software program. Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by HCl methanolysis as described previously (13Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16537-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gas chromatography was performed on a Varian 3400CX chromatograph using a Supelcowax TM10 30 m × 0.32 mm column (Supelco) temperature programmed from 70 to 240 °C at 40 °C/min. Data were collected and analyzed using the Class-VP Chromatography Data System version 4.1 (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments) software. Sphingolipid and glycerolipid fatty acids were fractionated from logarithmic phase cells as described by Pinto et al. (14Pinto W.J. Wells G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5% trichloroacetic acid-washed cell pellets were subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis. The methanolic-KOH extract, which contains saponifiable fatty acids from glycerolipids, was acidified and extracted with petroleum ether as described previously (15Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28281-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Extracted fatty acids were dried under nitrogen, and methyl esters were prepared by HCl methanolysis. Sphingolipids were extracted from the saponified cell pellets with an ethanol/water/diethylether/pyridine/NH4OH (15:15:5:1:0.018 by volume) solvent. After drying under nitrogen, sphingolipid fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by HCl methanolysis. Glucose-grown cells were cultured in 200 ml of YPAD culture to 3 × 107 cells/ml. For oleic acid induced cells, cultures were pregrown in 50 ml of YPAD medium to 3 × 107 cells/ml and washed with YP medium containing 3% glycerol. Cells were resuspended in 200 ml of YP medium containing 3% glycerol, 0.1% oleic acid, and 0.25% Tween 40 at a density of 4 × 106 cell/ml and grown for 18 h to 3 × 107 cells/ml. Formation of spheroplasts, homogenization, and differential centrifugation were performed according to Thieringeret al. (16Thieringer R. Shio H. Han Y.S. Cohen G. Lazarow P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 510-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold water and incubated in Zymolase buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 m sorbitol, 30 mmdithiothreitol) for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then resuspended in Zymolase buffer and incubated with Zymolase (0.1 mg/g of cells (wet weight) for glucose-grown cells and 2 mg/g for oleic acid-induced cells) for 60 min at 30 °C with shaking at 50 rpm. Spheroplasts were washed by resuspension of centrifuged pellets in 2 volumes of ice-cold Zymolase buffer three times, followed by resuspension in 2 volumes of lysis buffer (5 mm MES (pH 6.0), 0.6 m sorbitol, 1 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% ethanol (v/v), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin). Spheroplasts were disrupted at 4 °C in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with 50 strokes. Homogenates were centrifuged at 3,500 rpm (1,500 × g) for 5 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor to remove nuclei and cell debris. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer, rehomogenized, centrifuged, and combined with the postnuclear supernatant. Aliquots consisting of 20% of the total volume were quickly frozen to −80 °C. The remaining fraction was centrifuged for 15 min at 25,000 × g. The supernatants (25,000 × g supernatant) were frozen and saved. The resulting pellet (25,000 × g pellets) was gently resuspended in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 600 ×g for 5 min to remove aggregated material prior to enzyme assay. Previously frozen supernatant fractions were centrifuged at 80,0000 rpm (256,000 × g) for 40 min in a Beckman TL100 microultracentrifuge to fractionate microsomes. Protein concentrations in cell fractions were measured by the Bradford assay method (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Preparation of the fatty acid substrate and assay of VLACS activity followed the method of Wanders et al. (18Wanders R.J. van Roermund C.W. van Wijland M.J. Schutgens R.B. Schram A.W. van den Bosch H. Tager J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 919: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The fatty acid substrate [1-14C]lignocerate was prepared as a 100 μm stock solution. Solubilized substrate was obtained by dissolving the dried fatty acid in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 10 mg/ml α-cyclodextrin and incubating for 30 min in a sonicating water bath at room temperature. Reactions were started by adding 20 μl of yeast extract to the assay solution (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 150 μmcoenzyme A, 300 μm dithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 μm [1-14C]lignocerate dissolved in α-cyclodextrin) to the final volume of 200 μl at protein concentrations of 50–100 μg/ml. After 30 min at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by transferring 150 μl of the incubation mixture to a glass tube containing 750 μl of Dole's reagent (isopropyl alcohol, heptane, 1 m H2SO4; 40:10:1 by volume). After vigorous mixing, the protein was removed by centrifugation, and 650 μl of the supernatant was extracted with 350 μl of heptane plus 190 μl of a solution containing 400 nm Mops-NaOH (pH 6.5). The lower (aqueous) layer was washed three times with 400 μl of heptane, and the radioactivity in that fraction was measured by scintillation counting. The radioactivity measured from the boiled protein control extracts was subtracted from the corresponding assay to determine the amount of acyl-CoA product. Cells were pregrown in 40 ml of CM to midlogarithmic phase, collected by centrifugation, and reinoculated at a concentration that would yield 2–3 × 107 ml at the end of the experiment in 40 ml of fresh CMt containing 0.5 or 1.0 mmfatty acids. Following incubation with fatty acids, cells were washed with 1% tergitol solution three times and distilled water three times. Aliquots of cells subjected to this procedure were plated on YPD medium and found to show no significant changes in viability compared with unwashed control cells. To measure fatty acid incorporation in FAT1-overexpressing cells, strains were grown in CMt (2% raffinose) medium, reinoculated in fresh CMt galactose medium, and grown for 4 h to induce theGAL1 promoter. 1 mm 18:2 was then added to these cultures for 1 h. To compare uptake over short times in fatty acid synthesis-defective strains, fas2Δ and fat1Δ/fas2Δ cells were grown in CMt supplemented with a mixture of odd numbered fatty acids (13:0, 15:0, and 17:0; 0.2, 0.4, and 0.2 mm, respectively). After 72 h of growth, the native, even chain length, fatty acids are replaced with odd chain species (Table VII), permitting detection of imported even numbered species (18:1, 14:0, and 16:0) that would normally be masked by their endogenous counterparts. Import was monitored by the addition of 0.5 mm even chain fatty acids to the growth medium.Table VIEffect of FAT1 deletion on VLCFA composition in sphingolipid (SL) and phospholipid (PL) fractionsStrainVery long chain fatty acid speciesSaturated fatty acidsHydroxy fatty acids22:024:026:0HO-24"
https://openalex.org/W2014463993,"In mammalian cells valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) forms a high M r complex with the four subunits of elongation factor EF-1H. The β, γ, and δ subunits, that contribute the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of EF-1H, are tightly associated with the NH2-terminal polypeptide extension of valyl-tRNA synthetase. In this study, we have examined the possibility that the functioning of the companion enzyme EF-1α could regulate valyl-tRNA synthetase activity. We show here that the addition of EF-1α and GTP in excess in the aminoacylation mixture is accompanied by a 2-fold stimulation of valyl-tRNAValsynthesis catalyzed by the valyl-tRNA synthetase component of the ValRS·EF-1H complex. This effect is not observed in the presence of EF-1α and GDP or EF-Tu·GTP and requires association of valyl-tRNA synthetase within the ValRS·EF-1H complex. Since valyl-tRNA synthetase and elongation factor EF-1α catalyze two consecutive steps of the in vivo tRNA cycle, aminoacylation and formation of the ternary complex EF-1α·GTP·Val-tRNAVal that serves as a vector of tRNA from the synthetase to the ribosome, the data suggest a coordinate regulation of these two successive reactions. The EF-1α·GTP-dependent stimulation of valyl-tRNA synthetase activity provides further evidence for tRNA channeling during protein synthesis in mammalian cells. In mammalian cells valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) forms a high M r complex with the four subunits of elongation factor EF-1H. The β, γ, and δ subunits, that contribute the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of EF-1H, are tightly associated with the NH2-terminal polypeptide extension of valyl-tRNA synthetase.

The EF-1α·GTP-dependent stimulation of valyl-tRNA synthetase activity provides further evidence for tRNA channeling during protein synthesis in mammalian cells. Aminoacyl-tRNA is the donor of amino acid in ribosomal protein synthesis. The tRNA molecule is aminoacylated with the corresponding amino acid by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, the aminoacyl-tRNA is converted to a ternary complex with elongation factor 1α, to give the immediate precursor of amino acid for protein synthesis: EF-1α·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA. Several lines of evidence have suggested that in mammalian cells the translational apparatus is highly organized. In particular, association of the protein vectors of tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and elongation factors, with the cytoskeletal framework has been reported (1Dang C.V. Yang D.C.H. Pollard T.D. J.

The existence of a channeled tRNA cycle during mammalian protein synthesis provided functional evidence for cellular compartmentalization of translation (8Negrutskii B.S. Deutscher M.P. Proc.

According to the proposed channeling scheme, aminoacyl-tRNAs are vectorially transferred from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to the ribosomes as ternary complexes EF-1α·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA (8Negrutskii B.S.

A. 1995; 92: 7158-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, the GDP form of EF-1α could be involved in the capture of deacylated tRNA at the exit site of the ribosome and its delivery to the synthetase (11Petrushenko Z.M. Negrutskii B.S.

Channeling, or direct transfer of metabolites from one enzyme to another in a metabolic pathway, is believed to increase significantly the efficiency of the overall reaction (12Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). For sequential metabolic enzymes, the stimulation of activity of the first enzyme induced by a protein-protein interaction with the second enzyme provides a structural basis for a channeling mechanism. As far as the protein biosynthesis machinery is concerned, the possible regulation of aspartyl- (13Reed V.S. Wastney M.E. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32932-32936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and phenylalanyl- (14Negrutskii B.S. Budkevich T.V. Shalak V.F. Turkovskaya G.V. El'skaya A.V.

In both cases, no stable protein-protein interaction between the synthetase and the elongation factor was detected. In connection with tRNA channeling from aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to EF-1α, two enzymes ensuring consecutive steps of the tRNA cycle, the multienzyme complex containing valyl-tRNA synthetase and EF-1H deserves special mention. The only stable macromolecular assemblage that involves an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and elongation factor 1α is the ValRS 1The abbreviations ValRSvalyl-tRNA synthetaseDTE1,4-dithioerythritolGMP-PNPβ;γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate 1The abbreviations ValRSvalyl-tRNA synthetaseDTE1,4-dithioerythritolGMP-PNPβ;γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate·EF-1H complex (15Bec G.

Biochem. 1991; 201: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). EF-1H, the “heavy” form of the translation elongation factor 1, is a pentameric complex of the four subunits α, β, γ, and δ in molar ratio 2:1:1:1 (17Janssen G.M.C. van Damme H.T.F. Kriek J. Amons R.

EF-1α forms a ternary complex with aminoacyl-tRNA and GTP to give the active species of amino acid for protein synthesis and delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site of the ribosome. The EF-1βγδ subunits contribute the guanine nucleotide exchange activity to regenerate EF-1α·GTP from EF-1α·GDP. The finding that in mammalian cells valyl-tRNA synthetase is exclusively found as a complex with EF-1H has suggested that this association might contribute an essential function in vivo. Here we show that EF-1α controls the aminoacylation reaction catalyzed by ValRS. Our results demonstrate that association of ValRS with EF-1H is absolutely required for the stimulation in trans by EF-1α. The ValRS·EF-1H complex provides a structural basis for the functional interaction between ValRS and EF-1α. The coupling of these two consecutive reactions during protein biosynthesis could have a regulatory function. valyl-tRNA synthetase 1,4-dithioerythritol β;γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate valyl-tRNA synthetase 1,4-dithioerythritol β;γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate The ValRS·EF-1H complex was isolated from rabbit liver according to a procedure adapted from that used to isolate the multisynthetase complex (18Mirande M. Le Corre D. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers (1 kg) from 13 rabbits were homogenized in three portions (w/v; total volume 2 liters) of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTE (1,4-dithioerythritol)) containing 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Postmitochondrial supernatant was adjusted to 2% polyethylene glycol-6000 by addition of a 50% stock solution in extraction buffer and stirred for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was recovered, adjusted to 5% polyethylene glycol-6000, and stirred for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the precipitate was dissolved in 200 ml of 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5% glycerol, and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The homogeneous solution was applied to a Bio-Gel A-5m column (Bio-Rad; 90 × 910 mm) equilibrated with the same buffer containing 10% glycerol. Fractions containing valyl-tRNA synthetase activity were combined and loaded on a tRNA-Sepharose column (50 × 315 mm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted by a linear gradient of 25–400 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6). Fractions with valyl-tRNA synthetase activity were pooled and applied to a Source 15Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 20 × 95 mm) equilibrated in 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and developed with a 50–1000 mm KCl gradient in the same buffer. Fractions with ValRS activity were pooled, concentrated by vacuum dialysis, and stored at −20 °C after dialysis against 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.6), 50% glycerol, and 2 mm DTE. Dissociation of the ValRS·EF-1H complex and isolation of its ValRS, EF-1δ, and EF-1βγ subunits in their native state was conducted in the presence of 0.5 m NaSCN as reported previously (19Bec G. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21138-21143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The free truncated ValRS species deprived of its NH2-terminal extension was obtained by controlled elastase treatment, as described (20Bec G. Kerjan P. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2086-2092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The free form of elongation factor 1α was purified to homogeneity from rabbit liver as described in (14Negrutskii B.S. Budkevich T.V. Shalak V.F. Turkovskaya G.V. El'skaya A.V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 18-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm NH4Cl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTE, and 25% glycerol. ValRS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, and the multisynthetase complex from rabbit liver were purified as described previously (14Negrutskii B.S. Budkevich T.V.

Homogeneous EF-Tu fromEscherichia coli was generously provided by Dr. Andrea Parmeggiani (Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France). Initial rates of tRNA aminoacylation were measured at 25 °C in 0.1 ml of 20 mm imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 3 mm KCl, 15% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm DTE, 5 mmMgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 60 μm[14C]valine (NEN Life Science Products, 50 Ci/mol), and saturating amounts (5–10 μm) of partially purified beef liver tRNA (valine acceptance of 325 pmol/A 260). Where indicated, the incubation mixture also contained GDP, GTP, or GMP-PNP, with or without EF-1α. Catalytic amounts of ValRS were added (1–5 nm) after appropriate dilution in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm DTE, and 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. All dilutions and incubations were conducted in plastic tubes. The reaction mixture was preincubated at 25 °C for 2 min and the aminoacylation reaction was started by addition of tRNA. Incubation was conducted at 25 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at times indicated and immediately quenched in 5% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated tRNA was collected on GF/C filters (Whatman). Filters were dried and counted in Lipoluma scintillation fluid (Lumac LSC). One unit of activity is the amount of enzyme producing one nmol of aminoacyl-tRNA/min, at 25 °C. Saturation kinetics of Val-tRNAVal synthesis by ValRS (2 nm) from the ValRS·EF-1H complex in the presence or in the absence of an excess of free EF-1α (500 nm) were obtained in the presence of 100 μm GTP in the incubation mixture. Michaelian parameters K m andk cat were determined by nonlinear regression of the theoretical Michaelis equation to the experimental curves using the KaleidaGraph 3.0.4 software (Abelbeck Software). For measuring the activity of EF-1α, the guanine nucleotide exchange assay was carried out as described previously (20Bec G. Kerjan P. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2086-2092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EF-1α·[3H]GDP complex was prepared following incubation of 6 μm EF-1α with 4 μm[3H]GDP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1500 Ci/mol) in 80 μl of 35 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mm DTE, 8.6 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm NH4Cl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 18% glycerol for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was put on ice and diluted by addition of 800 μl of ice-cold exchange buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm NH4Cl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The exchange reaction was conducted at 0 °C after addition of exchange buffer containing nucleotide and specified exchange factors. Aliquots were taken at times indicated and immediately filtered through nitrocellulose filters (Sartorius; pore size 0.45 μm). Filters were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NH4Cl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), dried, and counted in Lipoluma scintillation fluid. To obtain the GTP form of bacterial EF-Tu, purified EF-Tu was incubated with 100 μm GTP in an incubation mixture containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTE, 0.5 mm EDTA, in the presence of pyruvate kinase (30 μg/ml) and phosphoenolpyruvate (1 mm) to remove traces of GDP. Incubation was conducted at 30 °C for 15 min, and the EF-Tu·GTP preparation was used immediately. Earlier studies suggested that tRNA aminoacylation catalyzed by ValRS is independent of its association with EF-1α. Indeed, the intrinsic specific activity of the enzyme, determined in the aminoacylation reaction, was not affected following its dissociation from the EF-1H complex (15Bec G. Kerjan P. Zha X.D. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21131-21137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bec G. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21138-21143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, whereas the EF-1β, -γ, and -δ subunits are tightly bound to ValRS, the EF-1α subunit can be easily depleted from the ValRS·EF-1H complex (21Venema R.C. Peters H.I. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12574-12580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggested that the ternary complex EF-1α·GTP·Val-tRNAVal is readily dissociated from the ValRS·EF-1H complex following completion of a single aminoacylation cycle. We reasoned that if valylation of tRNAVal by ValRS is controlled by EF-1α, this effect should be detected only in the presence of an excess of free EF-1α. If ValRS and EF-1α activities are coupled, as expected if tRNA is channeled from the synthetase to the elongation factor, addition in the reaction mixture of free EF-1α in excess, that could be effectively transformed into its EF-1α·GTP species by the β, γ, and δ subunits of EF-1H in the presence of GTP, should result in an enhanced rate of Val-tRNAValformation. When all EF-1α is transformed to a ternary complex with the aminoacylated tRNA, this stimulation should ceased. Therefore, we devised an aminoacylation assay designated to test a putative effect of EF-1α·GTP on the valylation efficiency catalyzed by the ValRS component of the ValRS·EF-1H complex. In the assay procedure used in our study, the reaction mixture containing the ValRS·EF-1H complex and free EF-1α in excess, but deprived of tRNA, was incubated 2 min at 25 °C before the aminoacylation reaction was started by addition of the tRNA substrate. This preincubation was necessary to avoid a lag in the time course experiments described below. Presumably, EF-1H is preloaded with EF-1α·GTP during this initial incubation. When catalytic amounts of the ValRS·EF-1H complex (1.5 nm) is incubated in the presence of an excess of free EF-1α (500 nm) and saturating amounts of the substrates for the aminoacylation reaction, in the presence of GTP to produce the active species EF-1α·GTP, the rate of valyl-tRNAValsynthesis was 2-fold increased, raising from 1.2 pmol/min to 2.1 pmol/min (Fig. 1 A). GTP alone had no effect on the rate of Val-tRNAVal formation. This increased aminoacylation rate was especially observed during the first minutes of the incubation, when the free form of EF-1α is still in excess. As exemplified in Fig. 1 B with a higher amount of the ValRS·EF-1H complex (3 nm), when consumption of free EF-1α is faster, the time course of valyl-tRNAValformation is clearly biphasic. The initial rate in the presence of EF-1α·GTP (4.7 pmol of valyl-tRNAVal formed/min) is 2-fold that observed in the absence of EF-1α (2.4 pmol/min). After the reaction proceeded for about 9 min, producing 45 pmol of valyl-tRNAVal, corresponding approximately to the amount of EF-1α added in the incubation mixture (50 pmol), the time course of aminoacylation returned to its control value determined in the absence of EF-1α. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1 A, in the presence of GTP the duration of the stimulation and the apparent initial rate of valyl-tRNAVal synthesis are functions of the amount of free EF-1α added in the incubation mixture. The GTP form of elongation factor EF-1α, and therefore its ability to contribute a ternary complex EF-1α·GTP·Val-tRNAVal, is absolutely required to stimulate the aminoacylation activity of ValRS. Indeed, in the presence of GDP instead of GTP, the rate of valylation of tRNAVal by the ValRS·EF-1H complex is not affected by the presence of a large excess (200-fold) of free EF-1α (Fig.2). The nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GMP-PNP did produce a stimulation of ValRS activity in the presence of EF-1α, albeit to a lesser extent, as compared with GTP (Fig. 2). This lower efficiency could be due to a slower rate of GDP/GMP-PNP exchange, as compared with the GDP/GTP exchange, leading to a decreased rate of dissociation of EF-1α·GMP-PNP·Val-tRNAVal from the ValRS·EF-1H complex, as compared with the regular ternary complex EF-1α·GTP·Val-tRNAVal. Accordingly, the rate of dissociation of GDP from the EF-1α·[3H]GDP complex in the presence of an excess of free GMP-PNP is not as fast as that observed in the presence of GTP (Fig. 3). Similarly, EF-1α·GMP-PCP has a stronger affinity for the EF-1βγ subunits than EF-1α·GTP, thus slowing down the exchange of GDP from EF-1α·GDP (22Janssen G.M.C. Möller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1773-1778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the inability of GMP-PNP to mimic GTP for the stimulation of ValRS by EF-1α also suggests that GMP-PNP, from which Pi cannot be released, has not the potential of GTP to produce a conformational change in the ValRS·EF-1H complex that would favor the dissociation of the ternary complex EF-1α·GTP·Val- tRNAVal.Figure 3Effect of nucleotide on the GDP exchange reaction catalyzed by EF-1H from the ValRS·EF-1H complex. The time course of GDP exchange from EF-1α·[3H]GDP (400 nm) was determined at 0 °C in the absence (▪) or in the presence (○, ⋄, ■) of the EF-1H subunits (4 nm) from the ValRS·EF-1H complex. The reaction was initiated by addition of 100 μm GDP (▪, ■), 100 μm GTP (⋄), or 140 μm GMP-PNP (○), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Radioactivity of [3H]GDP bound to EF-1α before addition of a chasing nucleotide was taken as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The simplest mechanism that might account for the observed EF-1α·GTP-dependent stimulation of ValRS activity would merely imply that the Val-tRNAVal formed is sequestered by EF-1α·GTP, thereby preventing product inhibition of ValRS activity. We tested this possibility by adding to the aminoacylation mixture the prokaryotic analogue of EF-1α, EF-Tu, that is known to interact, in its GTP-bound form, with eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNAs (23Slobin L.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 1388-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Since EF-Tu has a much lower affinity for GTP than for GDP (24Arai K. Kawakita M. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 76: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and cannot be charged with GTP by the nucleotide exchange subunits of EF-1H (unpublished observation), nucleotide exchange was performed by preincubation of the factor with an excess of GTP in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase. When EF-1α·GTP was substituted by EF-Tu·GTP in the aminoacylation reaction, no stimulatory effect of EF-Tu·GTP on the ValRS aminoacylation activity was observed at different concentrations of the factor (0.5–2 μm) (Fig. 4). This result suggested that the EF-1α-induced stimulation of Val-tRNA synthesis catalyzed by the ValRS component of the ValRS·EF-1H complex is contributed by a protein-protein interaction requiring cognate factors from higher eukaryotic origin. To test for the requirement of the native ValRS·EF-1H assembly in the EF-1α·GTP stimulation of ValRS activity, two ValRS derivatives that behave as free species were isolated from the complex. It was shown previously that the ability of ValRS to associate with EF-1H is lost upon conversion by elastase of the native enzyme of 140 kDa to a fully active truncated form of 125 kDa (20Bec G. Kerjan P. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2086-2092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 200-amino acid extension of ValRS lost upon elastase treatment is involved in the assembly of the ValRS·EF-1H complex through protein-protein interaction with the δ subunit of EF-1H. Furthermore, native ValRS can be dissociated from the EF-1H components in the presence of 0.5 m NaSCN, a chaotropic salt (19Bec G. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21138-21143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting monomeric ValRS species is isolated without loss of its aminoacylation activity. These two monomeric ValRS species were assayed for their potential to be stimulated by EF-1α·GTP in conditions where the native ValRS·EF-1H species does. Neither the truncated free ValRS, nor the native free ValRS, could be activated by the addition of preformed EF-1α·GTP in the incubation mixture (Fig.5). Further addition of the EF-1βγ subunits in the assay had no effect on ValRS activity (Fig. 5). As shown previously, the EF-1β and -γ subunits form a stable complex that efficiently exchanges the nucleotide from EF-1α·GDP but does not associate to the isolated 140- or 125-kDa ValRS species (20Bec G. Kerjan P. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2086-2092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of the EF-1δ subunit the ValRS·EF-1H complex cannot be reconstituted. On the other hand, the EF-1δ subunit associates with the native 140-kDa ValRS form (20Bec G. Kerjan P. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2086-2092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but in the absence of the β and γ subunits, this nucleotide exchange factor alone did not confer on EF-1α the ability to stimulate ValRS activity (not shown). Therefore, the association of ValRS with the β, γ, and δ subunits of EF-1H seems to be absolutely required to produce a functional interaction between the synthetase and elongation factor EF-1α. This result suggests that a proper positioning of EF-1α·GTP and ValRS·Val-tRNAVal contributes an essential step for the activation of the synthetase activity. The presence in solution of a competitor protein (EF-1α·GTP or EF-Tu·GTP) with a high affinity for the newly synthesized aminoacyl-tRNA cannot per seexplain the observed stimulation effect. In the case of yeast ValRS, for which dissociation of the aminoacyl-tRNA was shown to be the rate-limiting step in the aminoacylation reaction (25Kern D. Gangloff J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2065-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), addition of EF-1α, EF-1βγ, and GTP proved to have no stimulatory effect (result not shown). Similarly, incubation of the multisynthetase complex from rabbit containing nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (18Mirande M. Le Corre D. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) in the presence of EF-1α·GTP did not confer on methionyl-, lysyl-, or aspartyl-tRNA synthetases increased aminoacylation rates (results not shown). The Michaelian parameters for tRNA in the aminoacylation reaction catalyzed by ValRS from the ValRS·EF-1H complex were determined in the presence or in the absence of EF-1α·GTP in the incubation mixture. Kinetic parameters were determined using 0.05–3 μm beef liver tRNA enriched in tRNAVal (325 pmol/A 260). The apparent dissociation constant (K m) for tRNA of 0.33 ± 0.08 μmwas not affected by the addition of EF-1α·GTP in the aminoacylation reaction. By contrast, the catalytic constantk cat was found to be increased 2-fold, raising from 0.17 ± 0.03 s−1 to 0.32 ± 0.04 s−1 in the presence of EF-1α·GTP. Therefore, we suggest that the major effect of the interaction of ValRS·EF-1H with EF-1α·GTP is in increasing the turnover number of ValRS, through a conformational change that would promote the release of Val-tRNAVal. The EF-1α-induced stimulation of ValRS can be detected in the presence of GTP but not of GDP. This finding clearly demonstrates the importance of the ternary complex EF-1α·GTP·Val-tRNAVal for the stimulation mechanism. As expected, activation is observed as long as some free EF-1α·GTP is available in the incubation mixture. When all EF-1α is converted to EF-1α·GTP·Val-tRNAVal, ValRS is no longer stimulated, suggesting that EF-1α does not rapidly dissociate from GTP and Val-tRNAVal. Although the intrinsic GTPase activity of EF-1α is stimulated by the aminoacyl-tRNA (26Crechet J.B. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), EF-1α does not appear to be efficiently recycled in this assay. Accordingly, it is possible to substitute GTP by GMP-PNP. This nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue can be regarded as mimicking the nucleotide substrate in its ground state complex. Therefore, the endogenous GTPase activity of EF-1α is not involved in the stimulation of ValRS activity. Mammalian ValRS is a 1265-amino acid protein (27Hsieh S.L. Campbell R.D. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As compared with its bacterial counterpart, the human enzyme displays a large NH2-terminal polypeptide extension dispensable for its activity (20Bec G. Kerjan P. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2086-2092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro reconstitution experiments have shown that this domain interacts with the δ subunit of EF-1H (20Bec G. Kerjan P. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2086-2092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that neither the native enzyme of 140 kDa nor the truncated 125-kDa ValRS species are susceptible to EF-1α mediated stimulation also demonstrates that the NH2-terminal extension of ValRS is not per se engaged in a functional interaction with EF-1α. Noteworthy, the NH2-terminal polypeptide extension of the multifunctional glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase, and the p18 auxiliary component of the multisynthetase complex display sequence similarities with this domain (28Quevillon S. Mirande M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This observation led to the suggestion that these polypeptide domains could be involved in the transient anchoring of EF-1α to the complex. Though we were unable to detect any effect of EF-1α·GTP on the activity of three components of the multisynthetase complex, namely lysyl-, aspartyl-, and methionyl-tRNA synthetases, we cannot rule out the possibility that a specialized adaptor molecule could be involved to provide a functional interaction between EF-1α and those synthetases, a role played by the EF-1βγδ subunits in the case of the ValRS·EF-1H complex. The EF-1α-induced activation of tRNAVal aminoacylation by ValRS requires the whole ValRS·EF-1H complex to occur. Neither bacterial EF-Tu can substitute for mammalian EF-1α, nor free dissociated ValRS can mimic the ValRS component of the ValRS·EF-1H complex. Furthermore, the isolated guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, EF-1δ or EF-1βγ, cannot individually sustain the activation of ValRS by EF-1α. All these results illustrate the direct connection between regulation of ValRS activity and the adequate association of ValRS and EF-1α within a macromolecular assemblage of defined composition and structure. The ValRS·EF-1H complex should provide a structural support for the functional interaction of ValRS with EF-1α. A synoptic model is outlined in Fig.6. ValRS is tightly associated to the β, γ, and δ subunits of EF-1H. EF-1α is loosely bound to this complex: (i) it is easily dissociated from the other components following chromatography on a Mono Q column (21Venema R.C. Peters H.I. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12574-12580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or following incubation with aminoacyl-tRNA and GTP (17Janssen G.M.C. van Damme H.T.F. Kriek J. Amons R. Möller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31410-31417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) catalytic amount of the ValRS·EF-1H complex can efficiently exchange GTP for GDP from a 100-fold molar excess of EF-1α·[3H]GDP (Fig. 3). Therefore, EF-1α·GDP can be recycled into EF-1α·GTP by the exchange factors bound to ValRS even in the absence of synthetase activity, at least in vitro (Fig. 6, top right). In parallel, the ValRS component of the complex is able to catalyze tRNAVal aminoacylation even in the absence of GTP or of an excess of free EF-1α, that is when the elongation factors are not functioning (Fig. 6, top left). However, the concomitant functioning of ValRS and of the EF-1 subunits is accompanied by a 2-fold increase in the valylation rate. Since thek cat parameter is primarily affected, the EF-1α·GTP facilitated ValRS activity is most likely the result of a protein-protein interaction that induces a conformational change in ValRS, and promotes the release of Val-tRNAVal from the enzyme, suggesting that product release is the rate-limiting step. Coupling of these two parallel reactions would favor the direct transfer of the aminoacylated tRNA to the elongation factor, with formation of the ternary complex EF-1α·GTP·Val-tRNAVal (Fig. 6, bottom).In vivo, this coupling could be responsible for the channeling of tRNA reported by Deutscher and co-workers (8Negrutskii B.S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4991-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7158-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Using a permeabilized cell system, they observed that exogenously added tRNA or aminoacyl-tRNA are not effective precursors for protein synthesis, suggesting that there is a channeled tRNA cycle in mammalian cells. In the case of the ValRS system, our results suggest that the release of the aminoacylated tRNA from the synthetase could be controlled by the availability of free EF-1α, therefore providing a rational explanation for channeling. In that connection, it should be stressed that a great deal of data reports that members of the EF-1H and of the ValRS·EF-1H complexes are the targets of phosphorylation events (21Venema R.C. Peters H.I. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12574-12580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Janssen G.M.C. Maessen G.D.F. Amons R. Möller W. J. Biol.

Van Sant C. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of these modifications is poorly understood but could alter translational efficiency. Whether these postranslational modifications have a role on the EF-1α-induced stimulation of ValRS, and therefore on tRNA channeling in vivo remains to be shown, but could be a means to regulate the efficiency of tRNA delivery for protein synthesis. The valuable comments from an anonymous reviewer are gratefully acknowledged."

The study of female parasite growth, development, and gene regulation is important because the eggs produced are responsible for the pathogenesis observed in schistosomiasis. p14, an eggshell precursor gene expressed only in sexually mature females in response to a male stimulus, is a model for female-specific gene regulation. The upstream region of the p14 gene shares sequences present in insect genes known to be regulated in a sex-, temporal-, and tissue-specific manner by members of the steroid receptor superfamily.

Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem afflicting 300 million people in 76 countries (1Engers H.D. Bergquist R. Modabber F. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1996; 87: 73-84PubMed Google Scholar). Egg production is not only responsible for dissemination of the parasite but also for pathology of the disease in humans. Therefore, studies of female schistosome reproductive development and egg production may define targets useful in disease control. Interestingly, female reproductive development is regulated intimately by a stimulus from the male parasite (2LoVerde P.T. Chen L. Parasitol. Today. 1991; 7: 303-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For many years it has been known that female schistosomes from single sex infections are stunted in size and sexually immature (2LoVerde P.T. Chen L. Parasitol. Today. 1991; 7: 303-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that schistosomes have an intriguing developmental system requiring signaling from the male schistosome leading to direct or indirect activation of a number of female-specific genes (2LoVerde P.T.

Members of the steroid receptor superfamily are likely to play a role in female-specific gene regulation of schistosomes. A similar sequence is present as part of an imperfect palindrome in the upstream region of p14 (2LoVerde P.T. Chen L. Parasitol. Today. 1991; 7: 303-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Furthermore, a direct repeat that follows the “3-4-5” rule of steroid response elements is present in the p14 upstream region (13Umesono K. Murakami K. Thompson C. Evans R.

Presence of these cis-elements in thep14 gene led to a search for schistosome homologues of steroid hormone receptors. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of Schistosoma mansoni RXR cDNA (SmRXR), and we provide evidence for a possible role in regulation of female-specific gene expression. retinoid X receptor Schistosoma mansoni electrophoretic mobility shift assays amino acids ultraspiracle protein glutathione S-transferase Gal4 activation domain synthetic dropout 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole mouse RXRβ Drosophila USP human RXRα retinoic acid receptor reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction base pair Degenerate oligonucleotides representing the conserved regions of RXRgenes with the amino acid sequences, CEGCKGFF (aa 288–295) and GMKKEAVQEE (aa 335–344), were synthesized for use in PCR (Fig.2). Using a cDNA pool derived from schistosome worm pair mRNA as a template and the RXRgene-specific primers, a 170-base pair fragment was amplified. This PCR product was cloned into TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and shown to be related to RXRs by NCBI Blast search analysis. The DNA fragment homologous to RXRs was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming and used as a probe to screen a female adult worm λZAP cDNA library. Seven positive clones were identified, the phagemids were excised, and then the cDNA inserts were shown to be identical in sequence. Amino acid comparison of SmRXR to Drosophila USP and human RXRα was performed using the Pile-Up program from the Wisconsin Package version 9. Phylogeny trees were constructed using the PAUPsearch and PAUPdisplay program from the Wisconsin Package version 9. The following parameters were used in construction of trees to confirm accuracy of the study: heuristic with parsimony, branch-and-bound with parsimony, branch-and-bound with minimal evolution, and neighbor joining. A fragment of SmRXR encoding amino acids 200–561 was inserted into pGEX 2T-1 to form pGEX-RXR. TOP 10 competent cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with pGEX-RXR. Transformed cells were grown to 0.45A 600 at 37 °C and then cooled on ice for 20 min. After the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cells were incubated overnight at 20 °C. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin and 75 μm aprotinin), sonicated, and the supernatant fraction collected after centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The GST-SmRXR fusion protein in the S18 fraction was purified by passage over a glutathione- Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with G-S binding buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). GST-SmRXR was eluted by addition of 10 mm reduced glutathione in G-S binding buffer. Rabbit anti-RXR was purified from serum of a rabbit immunized with recombinant GST-SmRXR by the method of Beal and Mitchell (15Beal J.A. Mitchell G.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 86: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Extracts from adult worm pairs, mature male worms, mature female worms, and 3-h schistosomules were loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-acrylamide gel in triplicate panels. One panel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the other two panels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) for Western analysis. One panel was probed with preimmunized rabbit serum (1:5000 dilution) and the other panel with affinity purified rabbit anti-RXR antibody (2 μg/ml). RNA was extracted from the following schistosome developmental stages: 45-day worms, 44-day female (bisex infection), 44-day male (bisex infection), 44-day female (single sex infection), 44-day male (single sex infection), 35-day worms, 32-day worms, 30-day worms, 28-day worms, 21-day, 15-day, 7-day, and 4-day schistosomule. RNA was isolated using the RNA-STAT-60 Kit (Tel-Test) following the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare total cDNA, 5 μg of total RNA was used as template for each 50-μl reaction. A total reaction volume of 31 μl containing RNA, RNasin (Promega), 1 μg of oligo(dT), 0.1 μg of random hexamers (Life Technologies, Inc.), and water were incubated for 10 min at 70 °C. After incubation, 1st strand buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.01 m dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm dNTPs, and 400 units of Superscriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to each reaction. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, 0.5 μl of reaction mix was used as template for PCR. SmRXR-specific oligonucleotides were synthesized for PCR: 5′ AACAGATCTACCTAATTTAACATAC-OH (aa 434–441) as forward primer and 5′ GCACGTAGTAAAGCTAATTCAG-OH (aa 581–588) as reverse primer. α-Tubulin-specific primers (16Mei H. LoVerde P.T. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were used in each reaction as a constitutively expressed gene control. To remain in the linear range of PCR, 28 cycles were performed. The PCR products were size-separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and quantified by the Molecular Analyst program, PC version 1.5 (Bio-Rad). The amount of SmRXR PCR product was compared within each reaction to α-tubulin product and then this value was compared among the developmental stages. The Matchmaker One-hybrid System protocol (CLONTECH) was followed with a few exceptions. The target-reporter construct pHisi-154, was made by inserting a 154-base pair DNA fragment, delineating nucleotides −220 to −60 of thep14 gene (Fig. 1), repeated 3 times upstream of the His3 promotor in the pHISi-1 vector. Target-reporter construct, pHisi-EL1, was made by inserting the DNA fragment, 5′ TTGACATTTTTAACTATCACGCTCAACTATCATT-OH (Fig. 1) repeated six times upstream of the His3 promotor. After preparing competent YM4271 yeast cells as directed by CLONTECH, 10 μg of the target-reporter construct was used for transformation. Yeast reporter strains were analyzed by Southern blot to ensure that proper integration of the target-reporter had occurred. The competent reporter yeast strains were transformed with either pACT-2 activation domain vector (CLONTECH) containing the SmRXR gene downstream of the Gal4-AD (pAC-RXR), pACT-2 vector, pADH1 expression vector containing the SmRXR (pADH-RXR), or pADH1 vector. The pADH1 vector is a 2-μm expression vector with a multi-cloning site upstream of a ADH1 promotor. Control transformations without DNA were also performed. In a sterile 15-ml conical tube, 10 μg of plasmid DNA, 200 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 330 μl of component reporter strain yeast cells were added. After mixing the DNA and yeast, 2 ml of LiAc/polyethylene glycol solution (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 0.1 m LiAc, and 40% polyethylene glycol) were added, and the suspension was vortexed. The transformation suspension was incubated while shaking at 200 rpm at 30 °C for 30 min. After incubation, 230 μl of Me2SO were added and mixed by inverting the tube gently. Cells were incubated for 15 min at 42 °C and then placed on ice for 2 min. Cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was aspirated. The pellet was resuspended in 2.3 ml of TE buffer. From the control tubes that contained reporter strains lacking DNA, 10 μl of cells were diluted 1:100 in TE and 200 μl per plate were spread onto SD/−his media containing 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT, a HIS3 competitor). From each tube containing reporter yeast strains transformed with plasmid DNA, 100 μl, were spread onto SD/−leu to test transformation efficiency. All plasmids used contained the selection marker leu2 gene. From each of these tubes, 200 μl per plate were spread onto SD/−his−leu containing AT at concentrations of 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 mm. The plates were incubated at 30 °C and checked each day for growth. On the 7th day, selected colonies were restreaked on SD/−his−leu plates containing AT. Yeast two-hybrid assay, originally developed by Fields and Song (17Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1982; 340: 245-246Crossref Scopus (4863) Google Scholar), was performed with the HybriZAP II Two-hybrid System (Strategene) according to the directions supplied from the manufacturer. SmRXR cDNA was ligated into the binding domain vector, pAS2–1 (CLONTECH) forming pAS-RXR. Control DNA included pGal4, p53/pSV40, and pLaminC/pSV40 (Stratagene). Yeast cells transformed with pAS-RXR, p53/pSV40, and pLaminC/pSV40 were plated on SD/−trp plates. Yeast transformed with pGal4 were spread on SD/−leu plates. After 1 week incubation at 30 °C, colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using theCLONTECH protocol. SmRXR cDNA was inserted into the pCITE vector (Novagen) forming pCITE-RXR and transcribed and translated using the Single Tube Protein System (Novagen). The manufacturer's protocol for [35S]methionine incorporation was followed except an additional 1.25 mm cold methionine was added to each 50-μl reaction. Negative control reactions with circular pCITE DNA were also performed. Samples were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography and then used immediately. A 250-bp sequence of the p14 upstream region, nucleotides −300 to −50 (Fig.1), was radiolabeled by PCR amplification of the fragment using [32P]dCTP. Every 20-μl reaction contained ZnSO4 buffer (4 mm Tris, 80 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm ZnSO4, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA), 5 μg of poly(dI·dC), 12% glycerol, and 5 fmol of radiolabeled p14template (18Gogos J.A. Hsu T. Bolton J. Kafatos F.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1951-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA binding reactions contained 1 μl of transcription-translation lysate. In cold template competition reactions, unlabeled p14 template (250-bp fragment) was added in 10 and 100 × molar excess of the radiolabeledp14 probe. In competition reactions with nonspecific DNA, a 250-bp fragment cut form pET32a DNA (Novagen), was added in 10, 100, and 250 × molar excess of the p14 probe. The following DNA sequences were added in 10, 100, and 250 × molar excess for competition reactions: 5′ TTGACATTTTTAACTATCACGCTCAACTATCATT-OH (direct repeat), 5′ TTTAATAATGATGCACTTAGTGAGGCACAACTCTTC-OH (imperfect palindrome), and 5′ TTCTAACGGTAGAATCAAAATAGTGAGTAATTCGTG-OH (Fig. 1). Binding reactions were incubated at 23 °C for 30 min and then loaded onto a 16-cm 4% acrylamide gel (6.75 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA pH 8, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 0.05% bisacrylamide). Electrophoresis was performed with a 6.75 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA and 3.3 mmsodium acetate running buffer at 4 °C. A 170-base pair DNA fragment that showed homology to RXRs was amplified using degenerate oligonucleotides representing conserved regions of RXR genes as primers and adult schistosome cDNA as template in PCR (Fig. 2). The sequence of the 5′ primer used for PCR encodes for an amino acid sequence found in the second zinc finger of all members of retinoid receptors, RARs and RXRs (19Kumar M. de Verneuil H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 20Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 21Forman B.M.

Res. 1993; 48: 99-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the 3′ primer encodes for an amino acid sequence of the hinge region that is identical in all identified RXRs and is not found in other members of the steroid receptor superfamily. After screening 400,000 plaques of a female adult worm λ ZAP cDNA library with the RXR homologous DNA fragment, seven positive clones were obtained. Restriction digest and sequencing demonstrated that all seven clones were identical. The nucleotide sequence of SmRXR translates into a protein of 743 amino acids with an approximate mass of 74 kDa. SmRXR is the largest reported RXR to date. Sizes of RXRs range from 410 amino acids for mRXRβ to 508 amino acids for dUSP (11Shea M. King D. Conboy M. Mariani B. Kafatos F.

Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of SmRXR to other RXRs reveals that this protein exhibits significant homology to the DNA binding domain and the dimerization domain of other members of the RXR family (Fig. 2). For example, comparison of the amino acids of the DNA binding domain of SmRXR (aa 271–336) to those amino acids in the same domain of hRXRα (aa 135–200) and dUSP (aa 104–169) shows identities of 69 and 68%, respectively (11Shea M.

The first zinc finger within the DNA binding domain of SmRXR has only four amino acid changes from that of hRXRα (25Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). The second zinc finger exhibits lower homology. Within the dimerization and ligand binding domain are heptad repeats (Fig. 2) containing hydrophobic amino acids at positions 1, 5, and 8 (21Forman B.M. Samuels H. Mol.

The amino acids of the dimerization motif of SmRXR (aa 531–680) share 48 and 35% identity to those of hRXRα (aa 325–463) and dUSP (aa 357–506), respectively (11Shea M. King D. Conboy M. Mariani B.

https://openalex.org/W1972320353,"Capsid assembly is the final event of virus replication, and its understanding is pivotal for the design of empty capsid-based recombinant vaccines and drug delivery systems. Although the capsid structure of several members of the picornavirus family has been elucidated, little is known about the structural elements governing the assembly process that is tightly associated with proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein. Among the picornaviruses, hepatitis A virus (HAV) is unique in that it contains VP1-2A as a structural component and the small structural protein VP4, which argues for an assembly pathway different from that proposed for other picornaviruses. Using a recombinant system we show here that proteolytic processing of the HAV capsid proteins' precursor P1-2A is independent of the terminal domains 2A and VP4 of the substrate. However, both terminal domains play distinct roles in the assembly of viral particles. 2A as part of P1-2A is a primary signal for the assembly of pentameric structures which only further aggregate to empty viral capsids when VP4 is present as the N terminus of the precursor. Particle formation in the hepatovirus genus is thus regulated by two intrinsic signals that are distinct from those described for other picornaviruses.

Particle formation in the hepatovirus genus is thus regulated by two intrinsic signals that are distinct from those described for other picornaviruses. Based on crystallographic data, the capsid structure of several members of the picornavirus family has been determined in detail (see Ref. 1Rueckert R.R. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-654Google Scholar for review). The mature icosahedral capsid is composed of 12 pentamers, which comprise five copies each of the four viral structural proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4. The particle's 5-fold axis of symmetry comprises parts of 5 molecules of the major viral capsid protein VP1 and is stabilized by an extensive network formed by the N termini of proteins VP1, VP3, and VP0, the precursor polypeptide of VP2 and VP4. At the 3-fold axis of the mature virion, the N termini of three VP2 molecules interact, and at the 2-fold axis VP2 and VP3 of neighboring protomers come in contact (2Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. Erickson J.W. Frankenberger E.A. Griffith J.P. Hecht H.J. Johnson J.E. Kamer G. Luo M. Mosser A.G. Nature. 1985; 317: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The smallest picornaviral capsid protein VP4, which is liberated during the final step of capsid maturation, is found on the inside of the capsid shell facing the viral RNA genome. The myristoylated N terminus of VP4 is located below the 5-fold vertices, whereas its C terminus is found at the 3-fold axis and thus near the N terminus of VP2. Based primarily on structural analyses of mature viral particles and on disassembly studies, it has been concluded that protomers that consist of one molecule of VP1, VP3, and VP0 and sediment at 5 S presumably assemble into 14 S pentamers (1Rueckert R.R. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-654Google Scholar, 3Hellen C.U.T. Wimmer W. Rotbart H.A. Human Enterovirus Infections. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1995: 155-171Google Scholar). For poliovirus, the prototype of the enteroviruses, it was convincingly shown by genetic studies that myristoylation at the N terminus of VP4 and/or its precursors is a prerequisite for assembly into 14 S pentameric and higher ordered structures (4Ansardi D.C. Porter D.C. Morrow C.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4556-4563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Marc D. Masson G. Girard M. Van Der Werf S. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4099-4107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, VP4 seems to be crucial for the release of viral RNA from the mature virion following adsorption to target cells (6Moscufo N. Yafal A.G. Rogove A. Hogle J. Chow M.A. J. Virol. 1992; 67: 6849-6857Crossref Google Scholar). Assembly of the picornaviral capsid depends on the proteolytic liberation of the individual structural proteins from the precursor P1 or P1-2A catalyzed by proteinase 3Cpro, which is encoded within the P3 domain of the viral polyprotein. The genetic map of hepatitis A virus (HAV) 1The abbreviations HAVhepatitis A virusELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the position of the viral structural proteins in P1-2A and the viral proteinase 3Cpro in P3 is illustrated in Fig. 1 and at thetop of Fig. 5.Figure 5Model for the hepatitis A virus assembly pathway and the role of the terminal domains VP4 and 2A of P1-2A (based on Refs. 3Hellen C.U.T.

Panel A, after 3Cpro-mediated primary cleavage, five molecules of P1-2A assemble to form 13 S pentamers, which are mediated by 2A. Upon proteolytic cleavage of assembled P1-2A, 14 S pentamers arise. Presumably due to rearrangements, these particles expose the neutralization epitope and are thus recognizable by the monoclonal antibody K2-4F2. 12 pentamers can aggregate at their 3- and 2-fold axes and form empty capsids. In the presence of newly synthesized viral RNA, the nucleic acid can be packaged by 14 S pentamers (not shown).Panel B, in the presence of 2A, the N-terminally truncated precursor VP2-2A can assemble into 14 S pentamers. Further aggregation at the 3- and 2-fold axes is not possible in the absence of VP4. Panel C, due to the lack of the primary assembly signal 2A, the precursor P1 does not assemble into pentamers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) hepatitis A virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay For the mature particles of HAV no crystallographic data are available.In vivo studies on morphogenesis suggested that assembly of HAV particles might be different from that of other picornaviruses (7Anderson D.A. Ross B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ruchti F. Siegl G. Weitz M. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 2159-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Bishop N.E.

In particular, maturation cleavage of HAV VP0, which yields VP2 and VP4 and generally converts noninfectious into stable infectious virions, seems to be protracted (9Bishop N.E. Anderson D.A. Virology. 1993; 197: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast to most picornaviruses, HAV structural protein VP4 is not myristoylated and only about one-third in length (10Tesar M. Jia X.-Y. Summers D.F. Ehrenfeld E. Virology. 1993; 194: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Possibly due to its small size, VP4 has so far not been detected in HAV particles. If present, it is rather unlikely that a protein as small as HAV VP4 fulfills the same structural role as the homologous but considerably larger polypeptide of other picornaviruses that extends from the 3-fold to the 5-fold axes of symmetry in the virion. Furthermore, HAV empty capsids and early assembly intermediates contain VP1-2A instead of VP1 (7Anderson D.A. Ross B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bishop N.E.

Virology. 1995; 213: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Whereas protein 2A of entero- and rhinoviruses functions as proteinase, the corresponding HAV protein is proteolytically inactive and forms part of the putative structural proteins' precursor P1-2A (1Rueckert R.R. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-654Google Scholar, 14Schultheiβ T. Kusov Y.Y. Gauss-Müller V. Virology. 1994; 198: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, HAV 2A can be considered a structural component and might thus be involved in morphogenesis. The HAV structural proteins (VP0, VP3, VP1, or VP1-2A) are released by proteolytic liberation from the precursor polypeptide P1-2A, which represents the N-terminal third of the viral polyprotein (for genomic map, see top of Fig. 5). In this study, we examined the role of the unique terminal domains (VP4 and 2A) of the HAV structural proteins' precursor P1-2A using a genetic in vivo approach. HAV P1-2A and its derivatives truncated at the N or C terminus were coexpressed with P3 as the source of the viral proteinase. Irrespective of the presence of the terminal protein domains, liberation of the structural proteins was equally efficient. However, the assembly of HAV particles was dependent on both terminal domains 2A and VP4 and is thus different from other picornaviruses. A model for the assembly of HAV particles is proposed. Construction of plasmids pEXT7-HM/HAS-P1-2A(E/S) and pEXT7-HM/HAS-P1[273] was described previously (15Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Müller V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For simplicity the proteins encoded by these constructs are here called P1-2A and P1, respectively. To ensure efficient processing of the VP1/2A site, the E/S cleavage site of HAV strain HAS-15 at VP1 amino acid position 273 was used (15Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Müller V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct a plasmid encoding the VP4-deleted precursor polypeptide, pT7-HAV1 (GenBankTM accession number M16632, Ref. 16Harmon S.A. Richards O.C. Summers D.F. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2757-2760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as template for polymerase chain reaction amplification with primers 5′-TTATGGCCATGGACATTGAGGAAGAGCAAATGATTCAATCAG-3′ (sense 5′-VP2) and 5′-TCTGGTCACCAGGAACCATAGCACAGATCAATCCCCCC-3′ (antisense 3′-VP2). After restriction with MscI andBstEII (underlined), the 0.4-kilobase pair fragment representing nucleotides 799 to 1189 of the attenuated HAV strain HM175 was inserted into pEXT7-HM/HAS-P1-2A(E/S) cut with the same enzymes. The resulting construct (pEXT7-HM/HAS-VP2-2A(E/S)) encodes the VP4-deleted polypeptide VP2-2A comprising amino acids 24 to 836 of the HAV polyprotein. Fig. 1 shows the genetic elements of all three P1-2A constructs. pGEM2-HM-P3, which has been described elsewhere, was used as the source of proteinase 3Cpro (12Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Müller V. J.

After replacing the medium by 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, incubation was continued for 18 h. Then the cells were scraped off the plate in 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. 70 μl of the crude cellular extract were separated on a discontinuous 12% SDS gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Colorimetric detection of recombinant proteins was performed with polyclonal anti-VP0 (18Gauss-Müller V. Lottspeich F. Deinhardt F. Virology. 1986; 155: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), anti-VP4 (19Tesar M. Harmon S.A. Summers D.F. Ehrenfeld E.

Since the anti-2A serum was raised against a purified recombinant polypeptide spanning amino acid residues 255–345 of VP1-2A of the attenuated strain HM175 and thus including the 19 C-terminal amino acids of VP1[273] (15Probst C.

Virology. 1995; 213: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), minor immune reactivity with VP1-containing proteins was observed (see lane 13 in Fig.2). For particle detection, the crude extracts were clarified by centrifugation. Then the supernatants were diluted 1:10 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and analyzed by an ELISA using the neutralizing monoclonal antibody K2-4F2 as capture and detection antibody (21MacGregor A.W. Kornitschuk M. Hurrell J.G.R. Lehmann N.I. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1983; 18: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ping L.-H. Jansen R.W. Stapelton J.T. Cohen J.I. Lemon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Each transfection assay was performed twice and analyzed in duplicate. Rate zonal centrifugation was performed as described before (7Anderson D.A. Ross B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Borovec S.V. Anderson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3095-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after lysis of 1 × 107 cells in 1 ml of NPT (100 mmNaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.3) the extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min and adjusted to 1% (w/v) SDS. Ultracentrifugation was performed in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 35 krpm, 4 °C for 3 h using a linear 5–30% (w/w) sucrose gradient in NT (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3). The gradient was fractionated from the bottom of the tube. 50 μl of each fraction (1 ml total) were analyzed by an ELISA using the neutralizing monoclonal antibody. For immunodot analysis, 450 μl of each fraction were made 0.4% in SDS, boiled for 10 min, and dotted on nitrocellulose. The subsequent immune reaction with anti-VP1 and anti-2A was performed as described above and expressed in relative units. The sucrose concentration of each fraction was measured refractometrically. Polypeptide P1-2A is the putative functional precursor of the HAV structural proteins that is cleaved by the viral proteinase 3Cpro contained in domain P3 of the viral polyprotein. To study the role of the N- and C-terminal regions of P1-2A (VP4 and 2A, respectively) in both proteolytic cleavage and particle formation, the HAV precursor polypeptide P1-2A and VP4- and 2A-deleted forms (VP2-2A and P1, Fig. 1) were transiently expressed in the presence of the P3 domain using vaccinia virus vTF7-3 as helper virus. By cotransfection of two T7-promoted cDNA constructs, we could exclude viral genome replication and focus our studies on protein synthesis and processing and particle assembly. Proteolytic cleavage efficiency was analyzed by immunoblot using antisera directed against purified HAV proteins. For the individual precursor proteins (lysates B–D), immune reaction with anti-VP1 shows that expression of P1-2A (lysate B), VP2-2A (lysate C), and P1 (lysate D) was equally efficient and generated the respective unprocessed structural precursor molecules (Fig.2, lanes 5–7). The lack of immunoreaction of the P3 extract (lysate A, lane 4) demonstrates the specificity of the anti-VP1 serum. The cellular lysates obtained after coexpression of P1-2A (lysate E), VP2-2A (lysate F), or P1 (lysate G) with P3 were analyzed for proteins reactive with anti-VP1 (Fig. 2, lanes 8–10) and anti-2A (Fig. 2, lanes 11–13), anti-VP0 (Fig.3, lanes 1–3), anti-VP4 (Fig.3, lanes 4–6), anti-VP3/VP1 (Fig. 3, lanes 7–9). As additional control for efficient coexpression of P3, lysates E, F, and G were analyzed for the presence of 3C-containing proteins, which are derived from autoproteolysis of P3 (see Ref. 12Probst C. Jecht M. Gauss-Müller V. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8013-8020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Fig. 2, lanes 1–3). Almost equal intensities of the bands 3C, 3BC, and 3ABC clearly demonstrate equal amounts of coexpressed and autoproteolytically active P3. The immunoblot with anti-VP1 and anti-2A of lysates E to G showed the expected processing products. VP1, VP1-2A, and VP3-VP1-2A were found as products of P1-2A (lysate E) and VP2-2A (lysate F), whereas the 2A-containing polypeptides were lacking among the products derived from P1 (lysate G), clearly demonstrating that correct processing occurred in this experimental system. The lysates probed with anti-VP0 and anti-VP4 showed processing products VP0-VP3, VP2-VP3, VP0, and VP2, which were identified by their electrophoretic mobility and by comigration with proteins of different immunoreactivity (Fig. 3). A nearly identical staining pattern was obtained by immunoreaction with anti-VP3/VP1 (Fig. 3). The specificity of the reaction with anti-VP4 was clearly demonstrated by the lack of any reactivity of lysate F (Fig. 3, lane 5). Based on these observations we conclude that the additional protein bands in Fig. 3 are aberrant translation or processing products and do not represent unspecific binding of the antisera. Taken together, it is obvious that P3-mediated cleavage of the HAV structural proteins' precursor P1-2A is efficient and is not affected by deletions of VP4 or 2A. Specific processing was not observed in the absence of P3 (Fig. 2, lanes 5–7) nor was cleavage of VP0 into VP4 and VP2 detected (Fig. 3, lanes 1–3). Aliquots of the same cell extracts used in the immunoblot experiments described above were further analyzed for HAV particle formation using an antibody specific only for particulate structures (upper panel of Fig. 2). The murine monoclonal antibody K2-4F2 used in the ELISA is directed against an immunodominant antigenic site that is essential for neutralization of viral infectivity. The conformation-dependent epitope involves amino acid residues of both VP3 and VP1 (21MacGregor A.W. Kornitschuk M. Hurrell J.G.R. Lehmann N.I. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1983; 18: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ping L.-H. Jansen R.W. Stapelton J.T. Cohen J.I. Lemon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8281-8285Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Ping L.-H. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neither 2A nor VP4 seem to be essential constituents of the epitope since mature infectious particles lacking 2A are efficiently neutralized by the monoclonal antibody K2-4F2 (23Ping L.-H. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and coexpression of the VP4-deleted precursor (VP2-2A) with P3 led to the formation of structures recognized by K2-4F2 (see below). In combination with sedimentation analyses, this monoclonal antibody is thus appropriate to monitor viral assembly steps subsequent to the initial association of uncleaved precursor polypeptides (see also Fig. 5 for the reactivity of K2–4F2). No K2-4F2-reactive antigen was produced when the precursor polypeptides were expressed in the absence of the proteinase implying that the uncleaved precursors do not form the neutralizing epitope (Fig. 2, lysates B, C, and D). The absence of K2-4F2 reactivity with uncleaved precursor polypeptides demonstrates the specificity of the monoclonal antibody in distinguishing between processed and assembled HAV structural proteins on one side and their precursor on the other. The highest antigenic reaction was detected after coexpression of P1-2A with P3 (Fig. 2, lysate E). Although processing of the precursor polypeptides did not depend on the presence of either VP4 or 2A (see Figs. 2 and 3), particle formation decreased to near background level when 2A was deleted (Fig. 2, lysate G) and to approximately one-fifth when VP4 was deleted from the precursor (lysate F). From these results we conclude that VP4 and 2A play important roles in the assembly of HAV particles. To characterize the sedimentation properties of the viral antigen, rate zonal centrifugation on a 5 to 30% (w/w) sucrose gradient was performed with extracts generated by coexpression of P1-2A, VP2-2A, or P1 with P3 (Fig. 4). The major antigenic product detected in the P1-2A + P3 lysate sedimented with approximately 70 S and thus has the form of empty capsids. Only minor quantities of antigenicity were identified in the 12% sucrose fraction (Fig.4 A). In contrast, the recombinant antigen produced by coexpression of VP2-2A + P3 showed a sedimentation profile characteristic for 14 S pentameric structures with virtually no empty capsids (Fig. 4 B). No K2-4F2-reactive particles were detected in the P1 + P3 or control extract (Fig. 4, C andD). These data indicate that no aggregation occurs in the absence of 2A and that assembly of HAV pentameric structures to empty capsids is impaired in the absence of VP4. The presence of only small amounts of 14S pentamers in the P1-2A + P3 extracts suggests that aggregation of pentamers to empty procapsids is highly efficient (Fig.4 A). As expected, RNA-containing particles sedimenting faster than procapsids were not detected in this system, probably due to the lack of putative packaging signals exposed on the viral RNA. To determine the VP1- and 2A-specific antigenicity of HAV particles, the fractions of the sucrose gradients were analyzed for HAV structural proteins by a denaturing dot blot assay. Both VP1- and 2A-reactive proteins were found in the fractions containing empty capsids or pentamers (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively). In addition to the K2-4F2-reactive particles sedimenting at about 70 S, faster sedimenting particles were reactive with anti-VP1 and anti-2A (Fig. 4 A). It is possible that the neutralization epitope of faster sedimenting particles in Fig. 4 A is masked by either aggregation or altered conformation. For HAV particles, a wide range of sedimentation coefficients have been reported (7Anderson D.A. Ross B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ruchti F. Siegl G. Weitz M. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 2159-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and it is not clear whether their formation depends on specific experimental parameters. Probably due to their heterogeneity, HAV particles could not be crystallized yet. No structural proteins were detected in fractions of gradient C shown in Fig. 4, confirming our previous observation that assembly of 14 S pentamers and subsequently empty capsids is abrogated when 2A is deleted from the polyprotein. From the experimental data presented here we can conclude that both terminal domains of HAV precursor protein P1-2A serve distinct functions in the formation of HAV 14 S pentameric structures and empty particles. Based on our results with deleted precursor polypeptides, we now modify and extend the previously reported assembly model for HAV particles (3Hellen C.U.T. Wimmer W. Rotbart H.A. Human Enterovirus Infections. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1995: 155-171Google Scholar,7Anderson D.A. Ross B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Borovec S.V. Anderson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3095-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is shown in Fig.5 A. Panels B andC of Fig. 5 depict impaired HAV assembly due to the lack of either VP4 or 2A. The C-terminal domain of P1-2A, protein 2A, is required for the initial assembly step leading to the formation of uncleaved 13 S and of 14 S pentameric structures upon proteolytic cleavage by 3Cpro. Although no structural data are available for HAV, this observation implies that 2A as part of VP1-2A might be located near the 5-fold vertices on the outside of the pentamer and the empty capsid. In contrast, assembly of the poliovirus particle depends on myristoylated VP4, which is found near the 5-fold axes on the inside of the capsid shell (2Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. Erickson J.W. Frankenberger E.A. Griffith J.P. Hecht H.J. Johnson J.E. Kamer G. Luo M. Mosser A.G. Nature. 1985; 317: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Based on the known structure of other picornaviruses with the N terminus of VP2 located near the 3-fold axis and on the small size of HAV VP4, we assume that this structural protein is found on the periphery of the HAV pentamer. We propose that VP4 as part of VP0 is required for the subsequent association of 12 pentamers at the 3-fold axis. Our data provide first experimental evidence that the terminal domains of the HAV and poliovirus structural proteins' precursor might have exchanged their roles in the initial assembly step. Whereas myristoylated VP4 of poliovirus P1 is required to initiate aggregation of pentamers, the 2A domain of HAV P1-2A signals this first step. Furthermore, our experimental data indicate that two distinct signals separately regulate HAV capsid formation. In a first step, the assembly of HAV pentamers requires the presence of 2A, and in a second step, VP4 is necessary for the formation of empty capsids. In mature infectious virions, neither VP0 nor VP1-2A was observed in significant amounts, suggesting that removal of both terminal domains of the primary processing product are essential for maturation (7Anderson D.A. Ross B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ruchti F. Siegl G. Weitz M. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 2159-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Bishop N.E.

Virology. 1993; 194: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Borovec S.V. Anderson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3095-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The autocatalytic cleavage of VP0, which liberates VP4, is common to all picornaviruses (1Rueckert R.R. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-654Google Scholar, 3Hellen C.U.T. Wimmer W. Rotbart H.A. Human Enterovirus Infections. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1995: 155-171Google Scholar). However, maturation of the HAV capsid apparently requires an additional cleavage step that is protease-catalyzed and presumably occurs on the outer surface of the particle. Recently, it was reported that up to 15% of HAV 2A can be deleted from the complete viral genome without significantly affecting the viability of the resulting virus, which had a small plaque phenotype (24Harmon S.A. Emerson S.U. Huang Y.K. Summers D.F. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5576-5581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the light of our results this observation can now be explained by inefficient particle formation due to the lack of the complete primary assembly signal. Our data presented here clearly show that the structural protein precursor P1-2A in combination with P3 is sufficient for the recombinant expression and assembly of empty capsids exposing epitopes essential for neutralization. These recombinant, noninfectious particles might prove useful for the design of diagnostic tools and in addition for vaccine products. Possibly, our data and the proposed model of assembly also apply to particle production of mengovirus and foot and mouth disease virus both of which contain 2A as a protein of unknown function and have been considered as vectors for gene transfer.

In conclusion, these studies describe the first functionally reconstituted mitochondrial carrier that displays an efficient transport activity for dCTP. The inner membrane of mitochondria normally possesses very low electrophoretic permeability to most molecules. However, through the action of specific transport systems, the inner mitochondrial membrane is selectively permeable to a number of co-factors, metabolites, and nucleotides (1Kramer R. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 974: 1-23Google Scholar, 2LaNoue K.F. Schoolwerth A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 871-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The AAC 1The abbreviations AACATP/ADP carrierHPThydroxyapatite 1The abbreviations AACATP/ADP carrierHPThydroxyapatiteis the only mitochondrial nucleotide carrier successfully isolated and reconstituted in an active state (3Klingenberg M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The AAC is highly selective for ADP and ATP, mediating the import of ADP from the cytoplasm and export of matrix ATP. The ATP-Mg/Pi carrier is another nucleotide transport activity that has been described in isolated mitochondria (4Joyal J.L. Aprille J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19198-19203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but has not been successfully isolated. Another member of the family of anion transport proteins that reside within the mitochondrial inner membrane is the phosphate carrier that catalyzes transport of inorganic phosphate into the mitochondrial matrix, where the phosphate is utilized for phosphorylating ADP to ATP (5Kaplan R.S. Pratt R.D. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12767-12773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP/ADP carrier hydroxyapatite ATP/ADP carrier hydroxyapatite The existence of a mechanism for mitochondrial dNTP uptake has been suggested by DNA synthesis experiments using isolated mitochondria (6Parsons P. Simpson M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1912-1919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Enriquez J.A. Ramos J. Perez-Martos A. Lopez-Perez M.J. Montoya J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22414-22420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies indicated that exogenous dNTPs could be utilized by isolated mitochondria to synthesize mitochondrial DNA. In addition, based on previous studies from our laboratory, antiviral nucleoside analog triphosphates in mitochondria appear to originate from the cytoplasm (9Chen C.H. Cheng Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2856-2859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, the absence of 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine-induced mitochondrial toxicity in cytoplasmic dCyd kinase-deficient cells suggested that the cytoplasmic-formed metabolite 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine triphosphate is the nucleotide source in the inhibition of mitochondrial DNA synthesis. Thus, the 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine triphosphate metabolites inside mitochondria appear to originate from the cytoplasm. However, the experimental evidence supporting the existence of a dNTP carrier in intact mitochondria is only circumstantial and not definitive as for other mitochondrial metabolite carriers. The final proof for the existence of a carrier protein is its isolation and functional reconstitution. To that end, we demonstrate that upon incorporation into lipid vesicles, partially purified mitochondrial protein catalyzes dCTP uptake. This transport activity displays unique substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity from that previously described for mitochondrial anion transporters. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a substantially purified preparation of this class of mitochondrial carrier activity in functional form. Hydroxyapatite (Bio-Gel HPT) was purchased from Bio-Rad. Blue Sepharose and Sephadex G-50 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. α-32P-Labeled nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Soybean asolectin (l-α-phosphatidylcholine), cholesterol, Triton X-114, Dowex 1 × 4 (100–200 mesh, chloride form), atractyloside, and nucleotides were from Sigma. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (from Baker's yeast; Sigma) was used to prepare [γ-32P]dCTP from dCDP as follows. A 1-ml mixture containing 10 units of nucleoside diphosphate kinase, 2 mm[γ-32P]GTP (100 μCi), and 0.5 mm dCDP in 150 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, and 10 mmMgCl2 was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 volumes of ice-cold methanol and incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min, the supernatant containing [γ32P]dCTP was evaporated to dryness and resuspended in 500 μl of water. The mixture containing dCDP, GDP, [γ-32P]GTP, and [γ-32P]dCTP was chromatographed by ion exchange HPLC using a Whatman Partisil-SAX column (4.6 mm × 25 cm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The nucleotides were resolved with a gradient consisting of water to 30 mm buffer (potassium phosphate, pH 6.7) from 0 to 10 min, 30–150 mm buffer from 10 to 15 min, 150 mmbuffer from 15 to 50 min, and 300 mm buffer from 50 to 80 min. Peaks were identified by authentic standards, and the peak corresponding to [γ-32P]dCTP was collected. The purified [γ-32P]dCTP was diluted 5-fold with water, placed over a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (2-ml bed volume), and washed with 20 ml of water to remove the phosphate buffer, and the [γ-32P]dCTP was eluted with 10 ml of ammonium formate (500 mm). The eluted sample was freeze-dried to remove the ammonium formate and resuspended to a volume of 2 ml in water. The purity of [γ32P]dCTP was verified by ion exchange HPLC as described above, and the radiospecificity was determined to be 90 μCi/mmol. Mitochondria were isolated from acute lymphocytic leukemia cells after leukophoresis of a patient in blast crisis and further purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient as described previously (9Chen C.H. Cheng Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2856-2859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen mitochondria (100–150 mg) were solubilized for 10 min on ice in 10 ml of a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 1% Triton X-114, 150 mmNa2SO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine. The detergent was separated from the aqueous phase by centrifugation at 280,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The upper aqueous phase was decanted, and the detergent phase was resuspended to 10 ml in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine (buffer B). The detergent extract was applied to an HPT column (1 g of dry HPT/20 mg of protein) connected in tandem with a blue Sepharose column (1 ml of Blue Sepharose/2 mg of protein) equilibrated with buffer B. The unbound protein-containing fraction was eluted from the tandem columns with buffer B. Asolectin was further purified as described (10Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1987: 143-144Google Scholar). For use in transport studies, cholesterol (120 mg/ml final concentration) was added to the asolectin (200 mg/ml final concentration). Cholesterol has been reported to prevent protein-mediated leakage in reconstituted proteoliposomes (11Schafer J.A. Giebisch G. Kristensen P. Ussing H.H. Methods in Membrane and Transporter Research. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 325Google Scholar). The asolectin was stored in chloroform under nitrogen in a light proof container at −20 °C. Immediately before use, an aliquot of asolectin was dried under a stream of nitrogen. Following the addition of 2 ml of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), the lipid was dispersed by sonication (Branson Sonifier 250; microtip output control = 4; 80% duty cycle; on ice) until the mix appeared transparent. Aliquots of freshly isolated protein fractions (typically 0.3 mg) were mixed with lipid vesicles (55 mg) to a final volume of 1 ml. This mixture was vortexed and then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. For ATP/ADP exchange reactions and dCTP efflux experiments, proteoliposomes were prepared in the presence of 100 μm ADP and 20 μm [α-32P]dCTP, respectively. These proteoliposomes could be stored at −80 °C up to 5 days without appreciable loss of dCTP transport activity. Immediately prior to assay, the samples were freeze-thawed twice (total of three cycles) using liquid nitrogen and thawed a final time in an ice-water bath followed by sonication (Branson Sonifier 250; microtip output control = 2; 70% duty cycle; 30 burst; total sonication time = 25 s; on ice). For ATP/ADP exchange reactions and dCTP efflux experiments, external ADP and [α-32P]dCTP, respectively, were removed by passing the proteoliposomes over an ion exchange column (Dowex; 1 × 3.5 cm) equlibrated with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) at 4 °C. The first 1 ml of the turbid eluate from the Dowex column was collected and then used for transport experiments. A heterogeneous population of large, primarily unilamellar proteoliposomes suitable for transport studies are generated by this general freeze-thaw-sonicate procedure (12Kramer R. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4209-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Kasahara M. Hinkle P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7384-7390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pick U. Arch.

All measurements of nucleotide uptake into reconstituted proteoliposomes were carried out at 37 °C. Transport was initiated by the addition of 4 μl of radiolabeled substrate (typically [α-32P]dCTP, 10 μm final concentration, 30 Ci/mmol) to 190 μl of proteoliposomes in a final volume of 200 μl. For competition assays, competitor was added to the desired concentration to the proteoliposome mix before the radiolabeled substrate. After the desired incubation time, the reaction mixture was placed over a Dowex ion exchange column (1 × 3.5 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) at 4 °C in order to remove the external radioactivity not transported into proteoliposomes. The liposomes were eluted with 4 ml of ice-cold equilibration buffer, collected in 16 ml of scintillation fluid, vortexed, and counted. Subtracting values obtained when a 100-fold molar excess of nonradiolabeled substrate was added 2 min prior to the radiolabeled substrate made corrections for nonspecific uptake of radioactivity. For efflux experiments, external radioactivity was removed by passing the samples through a Dowex column and collecting and counting the liposomes as described above. The transport activity was calculated by subtracting the experimental values from the control values (efflux at 4 °C). Mitochondria possess a variety of specific carrier systems for the transport of metabolites across the inner mitochondria membrane. Because of the importance of mitochondrial toxicity in nucleoside analog chemotherapy (for a review, see Ref. 16Parker W.B. Cheng Y.C. J. NIH Res. 1994; 6: 57-61Google Scholar), we have sought to extend our knowledge about dCTP uptake into mitochondria. Our procedure for isolation and reconstitution of active dCTP transport from human mitochondria consisted of three basic steps. First, sucrose gradient isolated mitochondria were extracted with Triton X-114. Second, hydrophobic membrane proteins in the detergent were separated from the aqueous phase. Finally, the detergent phase containing solubilized membrane proteins was chromatographed on HPT and blue Sepharose. When applying these conditions to mitochondria from acute lymphocytic leukemia cells, the activity of dCTP transport was significantly enriched, but it remains a heterogeneous mixture of proteins. In Table I the activity of the protein obtained by blue Sepharose chromatography relative to that of the HPT chromatography is reported. For comparison, we report also the data on the total mitochondrial membrane extract. However, reconstitution of a total membrane extract in liposomes and its comparison with the data obtained from a smaller number of proteins after chromatography should be done with caution and may not be fully reliable because of differences in protein-protein interactions, liposome size, and passive permeabilities. Uptake of [α-32P]dCTP could be detected in proteoliposomes reconstituted using crude mitochondrial protein extracts and detergent phase membrane proteins with a specific activity of 2.8 and 18 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. However, only minimal dCTP transport activity could be detected in proteoliposomes using aqueous phase proteins after detergent phase separation. Approximately 180- and 90-fold increases in the specific activity of dCTP uptake in proteoliposomes compared with crude extracts were obtained after HPT and blue Sepharose chromatography, respectively. The decrease in specific activity after blue Sepharose chromatography compared with HPT elutes may indicate the presence of multiple dCTP transport activities resolved by blue Sepharose. Alternatively, this result may suggest the removal of a protein(s) component of a multisubunit complex responsible for dCTP transport. Furthermore, there is a large increase in the total activity recovered in the HPT eluate (i.e. 965%) relative to the starting material. The recovery of activity greater than the starting material may reflect the removal of an inhibitor or interfering activity. Further studies will be required to define the role of these factors in the above observations.Table IPartial purification of the dCTP carrier activity from human acute lymphocytic leukemia mitochondriaTotal proteindCTP uptakemgpmol/min/mg proteinTriton X-114 extract962.8Detergent phase5018Aqueous phase33<1HPT eluate5.2499Blue Sepharose eluate3.8248Sucrose gradient isolated mitochondria were used as a starting material.

Hydroxyapatite chromatography is important because it offers a large single purification step common to mitochondrial anion transporters (17Claeys D. Azzi A. J. Biol.

Under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” the reconstituted protein eluate after HPT chromatography contained atractyloside-sensitive AAC activity in addition to dCTP transport activity (data not shown). To improve the purification of the dCTP carrier activity, the protein eluate after HPT chromatography was applied to a blue Sepharose column to remove the AAC activity (24Rojo M. Wallimann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Table II shows that after HPT and blue Sepharose chromatography the internalized ADP as a counterion did not stimulate ATP uptake in reconstituted proteoliposomes. This is in contrast to HPT protein eluates reconstituted into proteoliposomes, where internalized ADP dramatically increased ATP uptake (data not shown). Furthermore, ATP uptake in proteoliposomes was observed after HPT and blue Sepharose chromatography but was not sensitive to the AAC inhibitor atractyloside. These results demonstrate that the reconstituted protein eluate after HPT and blue Sepharose chromatography is capable of ATP transport, but this activity is not associated with AAC activity. Further studies will be required to determine whether one or more proteins are present that play a role in dCTP and ATP transport.Table IIATP uptake in proteoliposomesInternal nucleotideCompeting nucleotideATP uptakeActivitypmol/min/mg protein%NoneNone113 ± 310010 μmdCTP63 ± 35650 μm dCTP45 ± 340ADPNone50 ± 14410 μm dCTP53 ± 34650 μm dCTP37 ± 433The protein eluate after HPT and blue Sepharose chromatography was obtained and reconstituted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For ATP/ADP exchange reactions, proteins were reconstituted in the presence of 100 μm ADP.

Means and S.D. values from three separate experiments are presented. The unbound protein fraction from HPT and blue Sepharose chromatography was functionally characterized for dCTP transport activity after incorporation into liposomes. To obtain a base line of transport activity in the absence of divalent cations, the effect of EDTA on transport using 10 μm [32P]dCTP in reconstituted proteoliposomes was measured (Fig.1 A). A significant dose-dependent decrease in dCTP uptake was observed with a maximum effect at 0.2 mm EDTA. We next measured the effect of 1 mm divalent cations on dCTP uptake in the presence of 0.2 mm EDTA (Fig. 1 B). Mn2+ and Zn2+ had a negligible effect, while Cu2+ and Co2+ inhibited dCTP uptake. However, Ca2+dramatically increased dCTP uptake, whereas Mg2+ and Ni2+ moderately increased uptake. In addition, NaCl and KCl were observed to have no effect on dCTP uptake (data not shown). The effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+ were further investigated in Fig. 1 C. A dose-dependent increase in dCTP uptake was noted with Ca2+ that was saturable at about 2 mm (an 8-fold increase), whereas the effect of Mg2+ was less dramatic (a 2.5-fold increase). What effect is Ca2+ having to stimulate dCTP transport activity? The transport assay described in this study consisted of several components that, in principle, could all be targets for the cations: negatively charged phospholipids, the negatively charged substrate dCTP, and the inserted carrier protein. Interaction of Ca2+ with the anionic substrate dCTP is questionable because of the large discrepancy in the actual concentrations used. Interestingly, the affinity of Mg2+ for ATP has been reported to be about 10 times higher than that of Ca2+(25Alberty R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3290-3302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If Mg2+ interacts with the triphosphate moiety of dCTP similar to that of ATP to stimulate dCTP transport in reconstituted proteoliposomes, the activation effect of Mg2+ should be seen at lower concentrations. Second, the results presented in this paper cannot simply be due to surface charge screening of the phospholipid vesicles, since there are significant differences with respect to the stimulation power between the various cations tested. Finally, although the protein may be the most reasonable choice as the target of the activation by Ca2+, further studies will be required to address this issue. The effect of protein concentration on the reconstitution of the dCTP transport activity was investigated by progressively increasing the protein concentration in the reconstitution mix while keeping the lipid concentration constant (55 mg/ml). Increasing the protein concentration from 0.05 to 0.4 mg/ml resulted in a parallel increase in the transporter-mediated uptake of [32P]dCTP (Fig.2 A). There also was a slight increase in the background rate of uptake with increasing protein concentration (<2 pmol/min at 0.4 mg/ml protein), but this increase was much less pronounced than the increase in the rate of protein-mediated uptake. From these experiments, we selected 0.3 mg/ml protein as an optimum condition to characterize dCTP uptake. In Fig. 2 B the dCTP uptake catalyzed by mitochondrial protein reconstituted into liposomes has been plotted as a function of time. There is an apparent initial rapid component occurring within 1 min and a slower uptake component that reached a steady state within 5–10 min. A temperature dependence in dCTP uptake is also observed with negligible [32P]dCTP uptake when the proteoliposomes are incubated at 4oC. Subsequent experiments were conducted at 1 min to assess the initial uptake of dCTP in reconstituted proteoliposomes. Because the insertion of protein in the lipid vesicle is in a random orientation, unidirectional transport in both directions may explain the time-dependent change in the transport rate. To measure the efflux of dCTP, proteoliposomes were preloaded with [α-32P]dCTP. Fig. 2 C illustrates a time-dependent efflux of [α-32P]dCTP from proteoliposomes similar to that observed for influx. To directly address if dCTP is transported without prior breakdown, dCTP was radiolabeled with 32P in the γ-position only and used for uptake studies. Fig. 2 D illustrates the time- and temperature-dependent uptake of [γ-32P]dCTP. Under these conditions, [γ-32P]dCTP uptake decreases in the presence of excess nonradiolabeled dCTP. 2E. G. Bridges, Z. L. Jiang, and Y. C. Cheng, unpublished observations. However, a 10-fold molar excess of inorganic phosphate has no effect on [γ-32P]dCTP uptake, suggesting that protein-mediated uptake of 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate (e.g.the phosphate transporter) plays no role in the observed transport activity.2 Thus, it is unlikely than dCTP is broken down before uptake into proteoliposomes. In addition, the exchange of a counterion (including dCDP or ADP) for dCTP in reconstituted proteoliposomes, similar to that for ATP and ADP in the AAC nucleotide transport system, has not been observed.2 We have thus far demonstrated the transport activity of reconstituted mitochondrial protein by measuring the uptake of radioactive substrate into proteoliposomes. With this assay method, the amount of substrate taken up can be measured, but it is not possible to obtain precise initial kinetic parameters because the radioactive substrate remaining outside the proteoliposomes has to be removed before the radioactive substrate transported inside the vesicles can be measured. Further studies were performed to elucidate a dose-response curve for dCTP uptake in proteoliposomes. The value obtained from a Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 3) indicated an apparentK m of 3 μm. The inhibition of dCTP uptake in proteoliposomes by ATP was also studied. Fig. 3 demonstrates that ATP competitively inhibits dCTP uptake. The K ivalue was estimated to be 8 μm by a replot of the slopesversus the ATP concentration. Numerous studies in cell culture, particularly that of the T-lymphoblastic cell line CEM, have demonstrated dCTP intracellular pool sizes ranging from 8 to 38 μm (26Iwasaki H. Huang P. Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Blood. 1997; 90: 270-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Xie K.C. Plunkett W. Can. Res. 1996; 56: 3030-3037PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gandhi V. Mineishi S. Huang P. Yang Y. Chubb S.

Whereas CEM cells are rapidly dividing cells in culture, another study using peripheral blood lymphocytes reported a dCTP pool size of 1.5 μm in quiescent cells and 18 μm in phytohemagglutinin-activated lymphocytes (31Gao W.Y. Cara A. Gallo R.C. Lori F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8925-8928Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Thus, the mitochondrial dCTP transport activity reported herein may be significant within the range of these reported intracellular dCTP concentrations. The substrate specificity of this novel mitochondrial carrier activity was examined by investigating the ability of dCTP and its derivatives to inhibit uptake of the unidirectional, inward flux of 10 μm [32P]dCTP (TableIII). If [32P]dCTP were broken down to [32P]dCDP or [32P]dCMP for transport, we would expect excess dCDP or dCMP to decrease uptake by dilution of the radiospecificity of [32P]dCDP or [32P]dCMP derived from the action of phosphatase present in the preparation. Excess unlabeled dCTP is included as a positive control. Uptake of [32P]dCTP was most affected by the triphosphate of deoxycytidine (dCTP), while the diphosphate form (dCDP) exhibited a moderate effect. In contrast, the nucleoside deoxycytidine and its monophosphate derivative (dCMP) had little effect on [32P]dCTP uptake (<10% inhibition). Thus, the reconstituted transporter discriminates between different phosphate forms of deoxycytidine. The uptake of α- and γ-labeled [32P]dCTP into proteoliposomes and the effect of excess dCDP and dCMP on uptake suggests that dCTP is the primary substrate used for transport.Table IIIEffect of competitors and inhibitors on the uptake of [32P]dCTP by proteoliposomesAdditivedCTP uptakeActivity remainingpmol/min/mg protein%None190 ± 3100dCTP13 ± 27dCDP122 ± 1164dCMP177 ± 293dCyd200 ± 8105Atractyloside285 ± 7150N-Ethylmaleimide162 ± 885PO4−158 ± 1283Competitors were added immediately before the radiolabeled substrate.

The effects of other nucleoside triphosphates on [32P]dCTP uptake are shown in TableIV. At equimolar concentrations, the purines GTP, ATP, dATP, and dGTP moderately reduced [32P]dCTP uptake in proteoliposomes with more potent inhibition with a 5-fold excess of competitor. Interestingly, these purines were more effective than TTP or UTP in competing for [32P]dCTP uptake in proteoliposomes. These results raise the possibility that the observed transport activity may not be specific for dCTP only but may reflect the activity of a general dNTP carrier. Further studies will be required to assess if the competition represents uptake of other dNTPs.Table IVEffect of nucleoside triphosphates on dCTP transport activityCompeting nucleotidedCTP uptake activity remaining10 μm concentration50 μm concentration%None100 ± 7100 ± 7dCTP45 ± 117 ± 2TTP77 ± 647 ± 1dGTP63 ± 532 ± 8dATP63 ± 336 ± 3ATP61 ± 732 ± 3CTP74 ± 150 ± 3UTP89 ± 273 ± 1GTP34 ± 120 ± 2The protein eluate from HPT and blue Sepharose chromatography was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transport was initiated by the addition of 10 μm [α-32P]dCTP and one of the competing nucleotides.

The sensitivity of the reconstituted carrier to externally added inhibitors was investigated using the sulfhydryl reagentN-ethylmaleimide (a potent inhibitor of the phosphate carrier) (32Stappen R. Kramer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11240-11246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), atractyloside (a specific inhibitor of the AAC) (33Arnaudo E. Dalakas M.C. Shanske S. Moraes C.T. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Lancet. 1991; 337: 508-510Abstract PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), and phosphate. N-Ethylmaleimide, atractyloside, and phosphate had no significant inhibitory effect on dCTP transport (TableIII). However, a 50% increase in dCTP uptake occurs in the presence of atractyloside. The mechanism by which atractyloside increases dCTP uptake is unclear. These data indicate that the phosphate carrier and the AAC do not play a role in the dCTP uptake activity observed in this study. We have not assessed the uptake of other dNTPs, although it is possible that there are other carrier activities for these metabolites. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a preparation of a mitochondrial dCTP carrier activity in functional form from any source. This transport activity suggests an important role of bioactive endogenous dNTP uptake in mitochondria. Thus, cytoplasmic pools of dNTPs may be available to mitochondria, which are continually being damaged, and for replication of their DNA. The transport activity reported in this study may also be important in mediating the mitochondrial accumulation of cytotoxic nucleoside analogs used in chemotherapy. Clinical and laboratory findings have focused attention on damage to mitochondrial function as a mechanism of toxicity of various drugs. Indeed, available evidence supports the hypothesis that the myopathy induced by anti-human immunodeficiency virus nucleoside analogs is due to inhibition of mitochondrial DNA synthesis (34Casademont J.

The factors regulating this process are incompletely understood, but a number of growth factors and cellular signals have been implicated (1Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2851) Google Scholar). We showed that interleukin-6 (IL-6) which is increased in the liver posthepatectomy is required for normal liver regeneration (2Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E.

We found that IL-6 specifically regulates the expression of a subset of genes that are transcriptionally activated in the regenerating liver, but other genes such as PRL-1 are induced normally posthepatectomy even in the absence of IL-6. We reasoned that examination of the regulation of PRL-1 gene expression during liver regeneration would help us better understand the IL-6 independent signals that are critical for liver regeneration.

Spinner N.B. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17286-17295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A non-canonical internal promoter, P2, was found in the first intron that results in a PRL-1 transcript beginning 8 bp downstream of the 5′ end of exon 2 and causes no alteration in the encoded protein. The first 200-bp region upstream of promoter P1 and P2 confers high basal transcriptional activity. An enhancer that binds a developmentally regulated factor was localized to the first intron of the human PRL-1 gene. Promoter P1 of the PRL-1 gene contained two potential Egr-1 DNA-binding elements. Early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1, also named NGFI-A, krox-24, zif268, Cef5, andTis8) is an immediate-early gene and encodes a transcription factor with three zinc fingers recognizing a GC-rich sequence, 5′-CGCCCCCGC-3′, which has been identified in the promoter regions of a number of genes (7Sukhatme V.P.

Egr-1 protein expression and Egr-1 binding activity increased in concert with PRL-1 gene transcription in regenerating liver. Egr-1 transactivated thePRL-1 promoter in the presence of an intact not mutant Egr-1 site, and the Egr-1 site at −99 was responsible for mitogen stimulation of PRL-1 promoter activity. For regenerating liver, female Fisher rats (160–220 g, Charles River) were anesthetized with metofane (Pitman-Moore, Inc.) and subjected to midventral laparotomy with approximately 70% liver (left lateral and median lobes) (20Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). For cycloheximide-treated samples, rats were pretreated 15 min prior to the laparotomy with 50 mg of cycloheximide per kg of body weight (5% solution in phosphate-buffered saline) intraperitoneally. Sham surgeries were performed by subjecting rats to midventral laparotomy and closure. Animals were allowed to recover for the times indicated in the figure legends prior to the isolation of the remaining liver lobes for purification of RNA, preparation of nuclei, and nuclear protein extracts. Regenerating liver RNA was prepared exactly as reported (21Mohn K.L. Melby A.E. Tewari D.S. Laz T.M. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To make the RNA probe for the RNase protection assay, EcoRI-linearized Bluescript KS plasmid template containing EcoRI/PstI fragment of ratPRL-1 cDNA was transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP using anin vitro transcription kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The probe used contains 32 bp of exon 1 and 180 bp of exon 2 (see Fig. 1). 50–70 μg of total regenerating liver RNA was used for the assay. After overnight hybridization of 0.5–1 × 106 cpm of urea-denatured 5% polyacrylamide gel-purified probe to the RNA, the hybrids were digested according to the described protocol (22Ausubel F.M.

The protected fragments were then analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. Nuclei preparation and nuclear run-on assays were carried out by following the previously described procedure (21Mohn K.L. Melby A.E. Tewari D.S. Laz T.M. Taub R. Mol. Cell.

Frozen nuclei were quickly thawed and pelleted, resuspended in 100 μl of nuclear transcription buffer (50 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm MnCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.35 m(NH4)2SO4, 2 mm EDTA) plus heparin (50 mg/ml), 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (specific activity, 800 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products), 1 mm of each ATP, GTP, and CTP. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 μl of a solution containing 10 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 50 μg/ml RNase-free DNase I was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with shaking. Following proteinase K digestion and phenol/chloroform extraction, thein vitro synthesized RNA was subsequently precipitated with ethanol-sodium acetate and redissolved in H2O. The same amount of the radiolabeled RNA (approximately 1–5 × 106 cpm) was hybridized to nitrocellulose membrane applied with 20 μg of linearized insert-bearing plasmids using a slot blot apparatus in the exactly same way as reported (22Ausubel F.M.

We used ATP synthase and β2-microglobulin as positive controls and Bluescript SK(−) as negative control. Human hepatoma cell line HepG2 cells, mouse embryo testicular carcinoma cell line F9 cells, and mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin, and 50 units of streptomycin (Flow Laboratories) as described previously (6Peng Y.

Rat hepatoma cell line H35 cells were grown in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin, and 50 units of streptomycin. To produce quiescent H35 and NIH 3T3 cells, the medium was changed to 0.5% serum/DMEM for 72 h. Following serum deprivation, NIH 3T3 and H35 cells were treated with 20% serum and insulin (10−8m), respectively, for the indicated times and harvested for preparation of nuclear extract. Cycloheximide treatment was performed as described previously (21Mohn K.L. Melby A.E. Tewari D.S. Laz T.M. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For the transient transfection assays (6Peng Y. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17286-17295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,23Peng Y. Schwarz E.J. Lazar M.A. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Taub R. Genomics. 1997; 43: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), HepG2, NIH 3T3, or F9 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes at a density of 1–5 × 105 cells/cm per dish for 16–24 h prior to transfection. Cells were incubated with calcium phosphate precipitates containing the indicated reporter plasmids, pSV-β-galactosidase reference plasmid (Promega) as an internal standard for transfection efficiency. After 16–18 h, the cells were washed twice with serum-free culture medium, complete medium was added, and then the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h before harvesting for luciferase activity assays performed with luciferase assay system (Promega) using the recommended procedure of the supplier. For serum stimulation assay, NIH 3T3 cells were serum-deprived (0.5% fetal calf serum) for 24 h after 16–18 h of CaPO4transfection. The cells were harvested with or without 4 h of 20% fetal calf serum induction. PRL-1 promoter constructs were cloned into pGL2 luciferase (Promega). Bal-31 nuclease was used to make deletion mutant constructs of PRL-1 promoter P1. TheSmaI-linearized plasmid pSma I (6Peng Y. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17286-17295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was incubated with Bal-31 exonuclease at 30 °C for various lengths of time, and the reaction was terminated with addition of EGTA to 20 mm. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the resuspended DNA was digested with XbaI and gel-purified on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The resulting DNA fragments were cloned into the luciferase report vector between SmaI and XbaI sites. The mutation of the consensus Egr-1-binding site was performed using QuickChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene following the standard procedure provided with the kit. The overlapping primers used for the site mutation are 5′-GAGGGGGCGGGCCTCCGCCCtttCCTGTCGGCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCCGACAGGaaaGGGCGGAGGCCCGCCCCCTC-3′ (backward). The correct orientation, mutation sites, and the 5′ and 3′ boundaries of the insert of all plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. All steps were performed at 4 °C, and 2 μg/ml proteinase inhibitors antipain, aprotinin, bestatin, and leupeptin were added into all buffers except phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Nuclei from regenerating liver and from cell lines HepG2, H35, and NIH 3T3 were prepared by using the described procedure (6Peng Y. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Biol.

Nuclei were lysed by the dropwise addition of 1/9 volume of 4.2 m NaCl and shaken for 30 min before being centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 50 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against Buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol) for at least 6 h. Finally, the extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and aliquots were quick-frozen in dry ice, 95% ethanol mixture and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. End labeling of oligonucleotides was carried out with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and purified by Sephadex G-25 spin column. Binding reactions were performed essentially as reported (6Peng Y. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Biol.

Nuclear protein extracts (3–6 μg) were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 10 μl of binding buffer containing 20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 12% glycerol for 15 min on ice. [γ-32P]ATP-labeled probe (0.5–1 × 104 cpm) was then added to the reaction, and incubation was continued for another 20 min. DNA-protein binding complexes were analyzed on 6% native polyacrylamide gel at 300 V using 0.5× TBE as electrophoresis buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film overnight. Supershift experiments were performed by incubating 1 μl of primary antibody with nuclear extracts in binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotides. Potato acid phosphatase treatment experiments were performed as described (26Tewari M. Dobrzanski P. Mohn K.L. Cressman D.E. Hsu J.-C. Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2898-2908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against Egr-1 and Sp1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. The synthesized complementary polynucleotides were annealed in 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 0.3 m NaCl at 90–95 °C for 10 min and then cooled down to room temperature. After being kept at room temperature for 24 h, the annealed oligonucleotides were purified on 15% native polyacrylamide gels. These oligonucleotides were PRL/B (−118, 5′-TCCGGAGGGGGCGGGCCTCCGCCCCCGCCTGT-3′ −87); PRL/B-mA (5′-TCCGGAGGGttaGGGCCTCCGCCCCCGCCTGT-3′); PRL/B-mB (5′-TCCGGAGGGGGCGGGCCTCCGCCCtttCCTGT-3′); PRL/B-mAB (5′-TCCGGAGGGttaGGGCCTCCGCCCtttCCTGT-3′); CRE(PRL/A) (−128, 5′-CGGAGTGACGTCCGGAGG-3′ −111); E2, PRL/C (−68, 5′-TCCAGACCGCGATTGGTGGCT-3′ −48). These oligonucleotides correspond to the specific elements of the human PRL-1 gene and were used as competitor DNAs in gel mobility shift assays. Consensus Sp1 (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) and Egr-1 oligonucleotides (5′-GGATCCAGCGGGGGCGAGCGGGGGCGA-3′) were from Promega and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. In addition, double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to Ap1, Ap2, and CRE consensus binding sites were purchased from Promega. 50–70 μg of whole nuclei or nuclear extracts were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Primary antibody anti-Egr 1 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted 1:1000 and incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody was added at a dilution of 1:10000 for 30 min and then detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer (27Du K. Peng Y. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PRL-1 is expressed as an immediate-early response gene in regenerating liver and mitogen-stimulated 3T3 fibroblasts. To assess the relative induction of the two rat PRL-1 gene promoters in liver regeneration, an RNase protection assay was performed. Like the human gene in which two promoters were identified (6Peng Y. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17286-17295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), two protected fragments of approximately 212 and 172 bp (Fig.1 A), which respectively represented the products transcribed from PRL-1 promoter (P1) and internal promoter (P2) located in the first intron, were increased during liver regeneration. Both PRL-1 transcripts were rapidly induced, reached a peak by 4 h, with 17.9- and 6.3-fold induction for P1 and P2, respectively, and remained elevated through 8 h posthepatectomy. Because the regulation of gene expression can be both transcriptional and post-transcriptional, we tested whether the induction ofPRL-1 gene expression was transcriptionally regulated. Nuclear run-on assays indicated that PRL-1 gene transcription, which was virtually absent in normal liver, increased by 14.8-fold at 30 min posthepatectomy and remained elevated (10-fold) at 2 h posthepatectomy (Fig. 1 B). As a control, there was no induction of the constitutively expressed genes for ATP synthase and β2-microglobulin and no signal detected for vector Bluescript SK. This indicated that PRL-1 was transcriptionally up-regulated during liver regeneration and that an increase in transcription could largely explain the induced expression of PRL-1 mRNA at early times posthepatectomy. Because of its larger transcriptional induction, we focused on determining the regions upstream of promoter P1 responsible for transcriptional activation posthepatectomy. Transient transfection experiments had revealed that virtually all of the basal trans-acting elements are located within the first 200 bp upstream of the human P1 promoter in both human hepatoma HepG2 and mouse NIH 3T3 cell lines (6Peng Y. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17286-17295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A number of potential DNA-binding sites were identified within this region. Gel mobility shift experiments were performed to characterize the various DNA-binding proteins that might contribute to PRL-1 gene transcription during liver regeneration. EMSA experiments with nuclear extracts from normal and regenerating liver confirmed the binding of transcription factors including CRE (PRL/A, −123 to −116), Sp1, Egr-1 (PRL/B, −118 to −87), and E2 (28Li R. Knight J. Bream G. Stenlund A. Botchan M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 510-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (PRL/C, −68 to −48) proteins to the consensus sequences (not shown). Most of these DNA binding activities were constitutive in normal and regenerating liver. The AP1 complex that bound the CRE is known to increase in liver regeneration (14Taub R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, transfection with c-Jun and c-Fos expression vectors did not have a major effect on the PRL-1 promoter P1 activity in NIH 3T3 cells or HepG2 cells (data not shown) nor did deletion of this region reduce mitogenic stimulation of the promoter (see Fig. 7), so no further analyses of PRL/A were performed. PRL/B bound Egr-1 and SP1, and Egr-1 activity increased posthepatectomy indicating a possible correlation with the transcriptional induction of the PRL-1 gene posthepatectomy. Two potential overlapping Egr/Sp1 sites were found in region PRL/B. Gel mobility shift assays were employed to examine Egr-1 and Sp1 binding activities with nuclear extract from regenerating rat liver at 30 min posthepatectomy. Egr-1 and Sp1 specifically bound to oligonucleotide PRL/B (−118 to −87) containing the two potential overlapping Egr-1/Sp1 sites (Fig.2, A and B). PRL/B oligonucleotide specifically competed Sp1 and Egr-1 binding to the consensus Sp1 and Egr-1 oligonucleotides (Fig. 2 A, lanes 8 and 12). Sp1 is a ubiquitous protein that is constitutively expressed at very high levels in normal and regenerating liver (see Fig. 4), and its DNA binding profile is well characterized. Therefore, we focused on Egr-1 interactions with the PRL-1 promoter region PRL/B. 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled Sp1 oligonucleotides was routinely included in EMSA experiments to prevent Sp1 from binding to the overlapping Sp1 sites in PRL/B. As shown (Fig. 2 B), Egr-1 binding to PRL/B was specific because excess unlabeled PRL/B oligonucleotides (lane 3) and antibody against Egr-1 (lane 5) inhibited complex formation, whereas preimmune serum (lane 4) or a large excess of unrelated oligonucleotides Ap1 (lane 6), Sp1 (lane 7), Ap2 (lane 8), and CRE (lane 9) did not. To assess the role of two potential Egr-1 binding motifs inPRL-1 promoter, we carried out in vitro binding studies to compare Egr-1 binding affinity to the two Egr-1-binding sites. Nuclear extracts from mitogen-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells were used in gel mobility shift assays. As shown mB oligonucleotide bound Egr-1 much less efficiently than either wild type or mA (16-versus 72-h exposure) (Fig.3 A). The unlabeled wild type oligonucleotide and mA oligonucleotide efficiently competed Egr-1 binding (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8), whereas mB competed Egr-1 binding weakly (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). Titration of increasing amounts of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide confirmed the relative affinities of mA and mB (Fig. 3 B). Addition of as little as a 50-fold molar excess of wild type or mA-mutated oligonucleotides resulted in a complete inhibition (Fig.3 B, lanes 3 and 9). In contrast, over a 250-fold molar excess of mB oligonucleotides was necessary to effectively compete Egr-1 binding to the wild type oligonucleotides (Fig. 3 B, lane 8). The results demonstrated that Egr-1 has an estimated binding affinity for the site B which is over 5-fold higher than for the site A. On the other hand, Sp1 binding activity was well competed in the presence of mB and wild type oligonucleotides but not mA or mAB, indicating that Sp1 binds most strongly to site A (Fig. 3 C). Mutation of the −99 site does not have a major impact on total Sp1 binding to the region (Fig. 3 C, and data not shown). We then examined the time course of induction of Egr-1 binding activity following hepatectomy and mitogen-stimulated NIH 3T3 and H35 cells. As shown (Fig. 4 A), some Egr-1 binding activity was present in normal rat liver, and Egr-1 binding activity was rapidly induced 30 min posthepatectomy with a 5–7-fold induction at the 1-h peak. The induction of Egr-1 binding activity was specific to regenerating liver and not simply due to the stress of surgery or induction of an acute-phase response, as sham operation did not significantly increase Egr-1 binding during this time (Fig. 4 A, lane 6 and 7). Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, did not block the increase in Egr-1 binding activity at 30 min posthepatectomy (Fig. 4 A, lane 8) but inhibited Egr-1 retardation complex formation at 3 h posthepatectomy (Fig.4 A, lane 9). In contrast, no Egr-1 binding activity was detected in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells and H35 cells, and there was little or no induction during the first 30 min after serum or insulin (10"

A key domain on αIIbβ3 is the ligand binding site, which can bind to plasma fibrinogen and to a number of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-type ligands. However, the nature and function of the ligand binding pocket on αIIbβ3 remains controversial. Some studies suggest the presence of two ligand binding pockets, whereas other reports indicate a single binding pocket. Here we use surface plasmon resonance to show that αIIbβ3contains two distinct ligand binding pockets. One site binds to fibrinogen, and a separate site binds to RGD-type ligands. More importantly, however, the two ligand binding pockets are interactive. RGD-type ligands are capable of binding to αIIbβ3 even when it is already occupied by fibrinogen. Once bound, RGD-type ligands induce the dissociation of fibrinogen from αIIbβ3. This allosteric cross-talk has important implications for anti-platelet therapy because it suggests a novel approach for the dissolution of existing platelet thrombi.

Integrins contribute to the structure of cells and tissues by providing the physical contact between a cell and the matrix. However, integrins are also involved in bidirectional signaling events that greatly influence development, angiogenesis, wound repair, and a variety of pathological conditions. Although considerable progress has been made toward identifying the members in the integrin protein family and toward assigning their physiologic ligands, there are several biochemical properties of integrins for which the underlying principles are not well understood. First, many integrins exhibit a very broad ligand binding specificity (4Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar, 5Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 585-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some integrins, even those that bind to the RGD tripeptide adhesion motif, can bind to ligands that lack an RGD sequence. For example, the two β3 integrins, αIIbβ3 and αvβ3, can bind to as many as 13 different ligands representing several protein families. Furthermore, some integrins can bind to adhesive proteins and to proteases, two classes of ligands with seemingly opposing functions (6Brooks P.C. Silletti S. von Schalscha T.L. Friedlander M. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 391-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 7Mesri M. Plescia J. Altieri D.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27183-27188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is not known how binding to ligands with such disparate functions is coordinated or regulated. Second, ligand binding to integrins can depend on activation. Signals transmitted from the cytoplasm can activate the integrins ligand binding function in the ectodomain, resulting in a proadhesive phenotype (2Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 10Williams M.J. Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 4: 109-112Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 11O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). However, integrins can bind to some ligands in the absence of cellular stimulation. Such binding is often referred to as “activation-independent.” Clearly then, there are two separable mechanisms of ligand binding. Third, when integrins bind their ligands, signals are transmitted in the opposite direction, or “outside-in.” These signals can ultimately alter cellular physiology and gene expression (13Pelletier A.J. Bodary S.C. Levinson A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J.

Recent work suggests that outside-in signaling can depend upon the type of ligand bound to integrin (17Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The biochemical basis for these ligand-dependent differences in signaling is not understood. One hypothesis that would have a major bearing on each of these issues suggests that integrins contain multiple ligand binding pockets (18Loftus J.C. Liddington R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, there is considerable circumstantial evidence to support this hypothesis. However, the existence of two ligand binding sites remains uncertain, particularly because there is little information to explain mechanistically how two such sites would interact, if at all. To test the two-site hypothesis, we examined the ligand binding function of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3, an integrin that binds to a number of different ligands. The ligands for αIIbβ3 can be grouped into two general categories. One class of ligands contains the well known RGD integrin binding motif (19Plow E.F. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Marguerie G.A. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8057-8061Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 20Plow E.F. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Marguerie G. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1987; 70: 110-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other class of ligands is represented solely by fibrinogen. Fibrinogen binds to αIIbβ3 through a non-RGD sequence present in its γ-chain (21Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 226-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Hawiger J. Thromb.

A. 1986; 83: 5708-5712Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Both types of ligands have physiologic importance for regulating platelet adhesion to the subendothelial matrix (24Ruggeri Z.M. De Marco L. Gatti L. Bader R. Montgomery R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 25Plow E.F. McEver R.P. Coller B.S. Woods Jr., V.L. Marguerie G.A. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1985; 66: 724-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in mediating aggregation with other platelets to form a thrombus (26Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10729-10732Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). There is a considerable discrepancy regarding the nature of the ligand binding pocket on αIIbβ3. Some studies imply that the two types of ligands could bind to distinct sites on αIIbβ3 (27Bennett J.S. Shattil S.J. Power J.W. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12948-12953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Santoro S.A. Lawing Jr., W.J. Cell. 1987; 48: 867-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), whereas other reports indicate the existence of a common, or overlapping, binding pocket (29Plow E.F. Srouji A.H. Meyer D. Marguerie G. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5388-5391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Lam S.C.-T. Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Andrieux A. Ryckwaert J.-J. Marguerie G. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 947-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A third hypothesis argues that the receptor contains a single binding pocket that can have different depths (31Beer J.H. Springer K.T. Coller B.S. Blood. 1992; 79: 117-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the ligand binding studies on αIIbβ3 have been performed under equilibrium conditions and show that the two types of ligands competitively inhibit the binding of each other. However, these prior measurements failed to distinguish between the two mechanisms of competitive inhibition, same site competitive inhibitionversus allosteric competitive inhibition (32Segal I. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). Here we apply real time kinetic analysis to show that αIIbβ3 contains distinct and interacting ligand binding sites. Competition binding experiments were performed with purified αIIbβ3 according to methods we have previously published (33Hu D.D. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21745-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, αIIbβ3purified from platelet lysates by RGD affinity chromatography (34Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Argraves S. Suziki S. Ruoslahti E. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was immobilized in the wells of microtiter plates. Radiolabeled ligand was added to the immobilized αIIbβ3 along with competing ligand until the binding had reached equilibrium (empirically determined to be 90 min). Free ligand was removed by extensive washing, and bound ligand was solubilized using boiling 1 n NaOH. Each sample was transferred to a glass 12 × 77-mm tube, and the bound ligand was quantified by γ counting. Each experiment was performed at least three times, and all points are the average of triplicate measurements. Data were analyzed and plotted using SigmaPlotTM. Double-reciprocal plots were generated using the 95% confidence interval of a least squares analysis. Equilibrium binding studies were performed on freshly isolated human platelets (35Marguerie G.A. Edgington T.S. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 154-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were purified from platelet-rich plasma by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-4B equilibrated in Tyrode's buffer containing 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% glucose, pH 7.2. For binding studies, platelets were diluted in Tyrode's buffer containing 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1.8 mmMgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% glucose to a concentration of 1 × 108 platelets/ml. The binding of radiolabeled ligands was measured on platelets stimulated with 20 μm ADP at ambient temperature and under equilibrium binding conditions (30 min). Bound and free ligand were separated by centrifugation of the platelets through a cushion of 20% sucrose. The platelet pellet was collected into tubes for γ counting or scintillation counting by excising the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Nonspecific binding was typically less than 10% of the total binding of each ligand and was measured by inclusion of a 500-fold molar excess of Searle Compound (SC) 1The abbreviations SCSearle CompoundSPRsurface plasmon resonance 52012 or Fab-9 with radiolabeled ligands. All points are the average of triplicate data points, and each experiment was repeated at least three times, yielding virtually identical results. Searle Compound surface plasmon resonance SPR was performed using the BIAcoreTM amine coupling kit according to previously published methods (33Hu D.D. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21745-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Importantly, the results reported here were obtained when either the integrin or the ligand was immobilized to the SPR sensor chip via the amine coupling kit. Only minor differences in dissociation rates were observed when the configuration of the assay was switched. Each sensorgram represents at least five similar repetitions, encompassing at least four batches of purified αIIbβ3 and three batches of human fibrinogen (Enzyme Research Laboratories). The association (k 1) and dissociation (k −1) rate constants were calculated from sensorgrams as described (36Altschuh D. Dubs M.-C. Weiss E. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6298-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Turbidimetric aggregometry was performed as described (37Panzer-Knodle S.G. Jacqmin P. Page J.D. Nicholson N.S. Zablocki J.A. Engleman V.W. Feigen L.P. Platelets. 1995; 6: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. ADP was used as an agonist at 5 μm. Three minutes after the addition of agonist to the aggregometer tube, SC 52012 or buffer control was added to the reaction. The disaggregation of the platelets was monitored for an additional 6 min. The ability of Fab-9 to induce disaggregation was measured by adding fibrinogen-coated blue polystyrene beads (6 μm in diameter) to platelet-rich plasma (38Coller B.S. Lang D. Scudder L.E. Circulation. 1997; 95: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Following stimulation of a suspension of beads and platelets with 20 μm ADP, platelets adhered to the beads and simultaneously aggregated. The coupled process was monitored in a microtiter plate reader at 562 nm, which detects the light scattering properties of the blue polystyrene beads. Two distinct classes of competitive inhibition between ligands for a common receptor are illustrated in Fig.1. Simple competitive inhibition, or same-site competitive inhibition (Scheme 1), is a competition between ligands A and B for the same binding pocket. In such a case, one ligand alters the affinity of a receptor for the other ligand. A separate type of competitive inhibition is allosteric, and it is more difficult to identify (Scheme 2). Allosteric inhibitors bind at physically separate sites. Like same-site inhibition, an allosteric inhibitor will change the overall binding affinity of a receptor for its ligand. However, allosteric inhibition differs because the two ligands bind at separate sites, and it may be possible for one ligand to interact with the receptor when the other ligand is already bound. Hence, ligand B could still interact with its binding pocket, even when ligand A is bound at a separate site. Here we show that αIIbβ3 has two separate binding pockets that interact in an allosteric manner (Scheme 3). The evidence in support of this conclusion is presented below. A series of competition binding experiments were conducted to determine whether αIIbβ3 contains two ligand binding pockets. Such measurements cannot be performed properly with natural RGD-type ligands like vitronectin and fibronectin because, in comparison with fibrinogen, they exhibit very slow association rates (39Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because they are multivalent. Both properties invalidate many types of kinetic analysis, a method that must be used to distinguish simple competitive inhibition from allosteric competitive inhibition. Therefore, we employed two model RGD ligands; Fab-9 is a human antibody engineered by phage display to contain an RGD in the antigen binding site (40Barbas C.F. Languino L. Smith J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10003-10007Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 41Smith J.W. Hu D. Satterthwait A. Pinz-Sweeney S. Barbas C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32788-32795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SC 52012 is a small molecule mimic of RGD (37Panzer-Knodle S.G. Jacqmin P. Page J.D. Nicholson N.S. Zablocki J.A. Engleman V.W. Feigen L.P. Platelets. 1995; 6: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). These two model ligands have several advantages. First, the rate at which they bind to αIIbβ3 (the association rate) is comparable with that of fibrinogen (39Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Smith J.W. Hu D. Satterthwait A. Pinz-Sweeney S. Barbas C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32788-32795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, both ligands are monovalent and bind to αIIbβ3 in a reversible manner, allowing for meaningful kinetic measurements and comparisons. As a first step, we measured the ability of the RGD mimetic SC 52012 to block the binding between purified αIIbβ3and the two macromolecular ligands Fab-9 and fibrinogen. The binding isotherms are shown in Fig. 2 along with double-reciprocal transformations of the data. The shape of these plots enables one to distinguish noncompetitive inhibition from competitive inhibition. Increasing concentrations of competing SC 52012 shift the binding isotherms for both 125I-fibrinogen (Fig.2 A) and 125I-Fab-9 (Fig. 2 C) to the right, indicating a change in their overall binding affinity. The double-reciprocal transformations of both sets of binding data intersect on the y axis (Fig. 2, B andD), a hallmark of competitive inhibition (32Segal I. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we conclude that the small molecule RGD mimetic, SC 52012, is a competitive inhibitor of the binding between αIIbβ3 and Fab-9 and also a competitive inhibitor of the binding between αIIbβ3 and fibrinogen. Although these findings are consistent with previously published reports indicating competitive inhibition between RGD ligands and fibrinogen, they do not distinguish between same site competitive inhibition (Fig. 1, Scheme 1) and allosteric competitive inhibition (Fig. 1, Scheme 2). As a second step, we performed the converse experiment and measured the ability of fibrinogen to block the binding of each of the RGD-type ligands to αIIbβ3. These studies were performed on gel-filtered human platelets, although virtually identical results were obtained with purified αIIbβ3 (not shown). An extensive series of preliminary binding experiments showed that all of the αIIbβ3 molecules on the platelet surface could be saturated at a fibrinogen concentration of 500 nm. Hence, fibrinogen was used in excess of this concentration (2.3 μm) in attempts to compete for the binding of [3H]SC 52012 and 125I-Fab-9. Fibrinogen failed to block the binding of [3H]SC 52012 to αIIbβ3 (Fig.3 A). In several experiments of this type, we observed no significant effect of fibrinogen on the affinity of αIIbβ3 for [3H]SC 52012. In contrast, Fab-9 (an RGD ligand) did block binding of [3H]SC 52012 (▪). A similar binding study showed that fibrinogen had only a minimal effect on the binding of 125I-Fab-9 to αIIbβ3 (Fig. 3 B). The presence of saturating levels of fibrinogen (2.3 μm) caused only a 2–3-fold shift in the K d of whole platelets for Fab-9 (1.9 ± 0.9 nm in the absence of fibrinogen to 5.9 ± 2.9 nm in the presence of fibrinogen (n = 3)). In contrast, SC 52012 was able to block virtually all of the specific binding between 125I-Fab-9 and αIIbβ3 on platelets (▪). In other studies, we attempted to favor the binding of fibrinogen over both RGD ligands by allowing a 20-min pre-binding step with competing fibrinogen. However, even under these conditions, fibrinogen did not interfere with the binding of [3H]SC 52012 or125I-Fab-9. It is important to emphasize that we have found that Fab-9 and fibrinogen associate with αIIbβ3 at similar rates, so fibrinogen's inability to block the binding of Fab-9 is not a kinetic artifact. Collectively, the results show that even though RGD-type ligands are competitive inhibitors of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3, fibrinogen fails to interfere with the binding of either RGD ligand. Such findings are inconsistent with same site competitive inhibition (Fig. 1, Scheme 1) and strongly hint that the RGD ligands are allosteric inhibitors of fibrinogen binding (Fig. 1, Scheme 2). Because our measurements indicated that RGD ligands are competitive inhibitors of fibrinogen binding, we sought to perform a definitive test that would distinguish between same site competitive inhibition (Fig. 1, Scheme 1) and allosteric competitive inhibition (Fig. 1, Scheme 2). MeasuringK d under equilibrium binding conditions cannot provide such a distinction because both modes of inhibition alter the overall binding affinity between receptor and ligand. Therefore, we used SPR because it allows one to measure the two components of overall affinity, ligand association and ligand dissociation, independently. In essence, SPR allows one to observe the binding reaction in real time,i.e. as it happens. Because fibrinogen failed to block the binding of RGD ligands to αIIbβ3, we reasoned that the RGD binding site is likely to be accessible even when fibrinogen and αIIbβ3 are in a complex. We further suspected that the binding of RGD might induce the dissociation of fibrinogen from the integrin. Such an observation would prove the two-site model. To test this idea, we measured the effects of SC 52012 on the association and dissociation rates between αIIbβ3 and fibrinogen or Fab-9. Particular interest was paid to the effects of the compound on ligand dissociation. SC 52012 prevented the association of Fab-9 with αIIbβ3 (Fig.4 A) but had no effect on the dissociation rate for this ligand (Fig. 4 B). This behavior is consistent with the conclusion that SC 52012 and Fab-9 bind the same binding pocket on αIIbβ3. SC 52012 cannot gain access to the RGD binding pocket and induce dissociation of Fab-9 because that binding site is already occupied by Fab-9 (same site competitive inhibition, Fig. 1, Scheme 1). SC 52012 had markedly different effects on the interaction between fibrinogen and αIIbβ3. It blocked association between fibrinogen and αIIbβ3(Fig. 4 A), but more importantly, SC 52012 induced the dissociation of prebound fibrinogen from the integrin (Fig.4 C). Saturating levels of SC 52012 increase the off-rate between fibrinogen and αIIbβ3 by 160-fold (from 6.2 × 10−5 s−1 to 1 × 10−2 s−1). Because SPR reports ligand binding in real time (as the binding reaction is occurring), the latter observation unequivocally demonstrates that SC 52012 can bind to αIIbβ3 even when fibrinogen is bound. Consequently, SC 52012 and fibrinogen bind to separate sites on the integrin (Fig. 1, Scheme 3). An important prediction of the two-site model is that integrins that are already in contact with the extracellular matrix could still bind ligands at the second ligand binding pocket and be redirected to other functions. Indeed, the two-site model also has important implications for anti-integrin therapy because it suggests a novel approach toward reversing integrin-mediated matrix contact. To test these predictions, we used platelet aggregates as a physiologic model of the interaction between an integrin and its matrix. We measured the ability of the two RGD ligands to dissociate an existing platelet aggregate, a structure that is formed by the binding of fibrinogen and αIIbβ3. As shown in Fig.5 A, the RGD mimic, SC 52012, enacted the complete dissolution of the aggregate within a period of minutes. When platelet aggregates were allowed to incubate for extended periods of time before the addition of the RGD-type ligand, less dissolution of the platelet aggregate occurred. Yet, even when aggregation was allowed to proceed for 15 min in the presence of maximal platelet stimulation (20 μm ADP), before challenge with SC 52012, 40–60% of the aggregate was consistently dissociated by the compound. Using a slightly different assay of platelet aggregation (38Coller B.S. Lang D. Scudder L.E. Circulation. 1997; 95: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we found that Fab-9 also dissociated platelets that were aggregated with fibrinogen-coated polystyrene beads (Fig. 5 B). In five separate experiments of this type, the molar ratio of Fab-9/αIIbβ3 required to enact 50% disaggregation ranged from 0.5:1 to 1:1. Calculations are based on an estimate of 80,000 αIIbβ3molecules/platelet. A platelet aggregate is a complex structure, and we cannot exclude the possibility that there are other parameters that influence the dissolution of aggregates when challenged with an RGD compound. However, the simplest interpretation of these findings is that dissolution of the aggregate is enacted by the same mechanism that induces dissociation of complexes between purified αIIbβ3 and fibrinogen. Consideration must also be given to the idea that the two ligand binding sites on αIIbβ3 are regulated by different means. The fibrinogen binding function of αIIbβ3is tightly controlled by platelet stimulation, a process that can be brought about by a host of physiologic stimuli such as ADP, thrombin, or collagen (2Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In fact, the binding of fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 on resting platelets is of such low affinity that it cannot be measured (35Marguerie G.A. Edgington T.S. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 154-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibronectin, an RGD ligand for αIIbβ3, cannot bind to resting platelets or even to platelets stimulated by ADP. It will only bind αIIbβ3 on the platelet surface when the platelets have been stimulated by thrombin (42Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9477-9482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the activation requirement for ligand binding appears to depend on the type of ligand being examined. In light of the findings in the current report, another interpretation of the observation of Plow and Ginsberg (42Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9477-9482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is that the two ligand binding pockets on αIIbβ3 are regulated independently by activation. To explore this possibility further, we compared the binding of Fab-9 and fibrinogen on resting versus activated platelets. The binding studies were done with 250 nm125I-Fab-9, a concentration we found to just saturate the number of αIIbβ3 molecules on the platelet surface when platelets were stimulated with ADP (see Fig.3 B). 125I-Fab-9 bound the same number of αIIbβ3 molecules on resting and stimulated platelets. In binding studies performed on blood from four separate donors, 125I-Fab-9 bound to between 30,000 and 100,000 sites/platelet, depending on the donor. The number of molecules of Fab-9 bound was equivalent in each case on resting versusADP-stimulated platelets. The number of binding sites for Fab-9 was also equivalent to the number of αIIbβ3molecules on the platelet as reported by the binding of125I-abciximab, an antibody that binds to αIIbβ3 in an activation-independent manner (43Wagner C.L. Mascelli M.A. Neblock D.S. Weisman H.F. Coller B.S. Jordan R.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 907-914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, parallel binding studies performed on the same platelets showed that 125I-fibrinogen is unable to bind specifically to resting platelets. However, upon activation with ADP,125I-fibrinogen bound to the full complement of αIIbβ3 molecules. Because Fab-9 and fibrinogen bind to separate sites on αIIbβ3, these observations are consistent with the conclusion that the two ligand binding pockets on αIIbβ3 are regulated independently by activation of the integrin. However, our findings do not resolve all of the discrepancies in binding data relating to activation of αIIbβ3. Although Fab-9 and fibronectin are both RGD-type ligands, Fab-9 binds αIIbβ3in the absence of platelet stimulation, whereas fibronectin will bind only when platelets are stimulated with thrombin. Nevertheless, in conjunction with prior reports, the results presented here suggest that the distinct ligand binding pockets on αIIbβ3 can be regulated independently by physiologic stimuli. Glanzmann's thrombasthenia is a series of genetic disorders in which patients either fail to express αIIbβ3 on the platelet surface or express a dysfunctional form of the integrin (44Kato A. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1997; 26: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Glanzmann's patients suffer from chronic bleeding problems. Interestingly, however, not all Glanzmann's defects are associated with the complete dysfunction of αIIbβ3. There are reports of defects in which αIIbβ3 fails to mediate platelet aggregation or bind to fibrinogen but retains the ability to bind RGD ligands. The two-site model of αIIbβ3 proposed in Fig. 1, Scheme3,provides a basis for such observations. The Strasbourg variant of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia contains a point mutation of arginine to tyrosine at residue 214 in the integrin β3subunit (45Lanza F. Stierle A. Fournier D. Morales M. Andre G. Nurden A.T. Cazenave J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1995-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Strasbourg αIIbβ3 bound to small RGD peptides but not to fibrinogen. It is reasonable to suggest that the Strasbourg variant results from a defect specific to the fibrinogen binding site even though the RGD ligand binding pocket remains functional. The knowledge that αIIbβ3 contains two interacting ligand binding pockets also has bearing on the application of small molecule antagonists of αIIbβ3 in anti-platelet therapy. Several such drugs are currently being tested as antithrombotic agents in large clinical trials (46Coller B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1467-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 47Tcheng J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 48Moliterno D.J. Topol E.J.

These trials are aimed at eliminating the ischemic complications that often accompany cardiac interventions like balloon angioplasty. During coronary intervention, complications are presumed to arise when platelets aggregate to form a thrombus, occluding a vessel and reducing blood supply. Anti-platelet therapy has been proposed as a solution to this problem. If αIIbβ3 interacted with two classes of ligands in a “mutually exclusive” manner (27Bennett J.S. Shattil S.J. Power J.W. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12948-12953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lam S.C.-T. Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Andrieux A. Ryckwaert J.-J. Marguerie G. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 947-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), then antagonists of αIIbβ3 could function only by preventing the association of fibrinogen with the integrin. In such cases, drugs directed toward αIIbβ3 would be effective only when applied before the formation of thrombi or in a prophylactic manner. The results presented here indicate that the binding of RGD-type antagonists to αIIbβ3will occur even when fibrinogen is already bound and when platelets have already aggregated. Thus, such ligands could enact the dissolution of an existing thrombus. Therefore, drugs that bind to site II on αIIbβ3 (Fig. 1, Scheme 3) may provide an additional benefit to the patient by enacting the dissolution of existing thrombi."

Using synthetic peptides of a previously identified fibronectin binding region (amino acids 269–292), the minimal binding sequence was determined to be 12 amino acids, 269–280 (FAP-A-(269–280)). Synthetic peptides were prepared in which each amino acid in the 269–280 sequence was substituted with Ala. Assessment of the effect of Ala substitution on fibronectin binding showed that the presence of Ala at amino acids 273–276 (RWFV) completely abrogated fibronectin binding activity. Furthermore, the ability to inhibit the attachment of viableMycobacterium bovis BCG to fibronectin was abrogated by Ala substitution at the RWFV sites. To validate the function of RWFV, further studies were performed with recombinant FAP-A in which single Ala mutations were generated for the RWFV sites and as controls at amino acids 269 and 280. Mutant FAP-A containing single Ala substitutions at the RWFV sites (amino acids 273, 274, 275, or 276) showed significant abrogation of fibronectin binding function. Recombinant FAP-A with Ala substitutions at either 269 or 280 showed wild type activity. When the four essential amino acids (RWFV) were either substituted en bloc with Ala or were all deleted, complete loss of fibronectin binding function was observed. Control recombinant proteins with en bloc Ala substitutions or deletions at four positions outside the fibronectin binding region (amino acids 255–257) retained functional activity. These data show that the RWFV sequence is necessary for fibronectin binding function of FAP-A. Furthermore, the data suggest that mycobacterial FAP proteins, all of which share the RWFV binding motif, constitute a family of highly homologous proteins that bind fibronectin in a unique manner.

Two distinct mycobacterial proteins or protein complexes, fibronectin attachment protein (FAP) 1The abbreviations FAPfibronectin attachment proteinfnfibronectinLNlaminin and proteins of the antigen 85 complex, have been linked to mycobacterial attachment to fibronectin (8Abou-Zeid C.

To date, FAP proteins from four mycobacterial species including M. leprae (FAP-L),M. avium (FAP-A), M. bovis BCG (FAP-B), andM. smegmatis (FAP-S) have been cloned and characterized (4Schorey J.S.

Using recombinant FAP-A and FAP-A peptides, two non-continuous fibronectin binding regions (amino acids 177–201 (FAP-A-(177–201)) and amino acids 269–292 (FAP-A-(269–292))) were observed to possess fibronectin binding activity (5Schorey J.S. Holsti M.A. Ratliff T.L. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Both sequences are highly conserved among all identified FAP proteins except FAP-S, which contains only the region homologous to FAP-A-(269–292) (5Schorey J.S. Holsti M.A. Ratliff T.L. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In vitro studies on FAP-A-(269–292) or its homologue in M. leprae, FAP-L-(240–263) showed this fibronectin binding region to be sufficient to block the attachment of all tested mycobacteria (M. avium, M. bovis BCG, and M. smegmatis) to fibronectin-coated surfaces and also to abrogate fibronectin-opsonized mycobacterial attachment to epithelial cells and Schwann cells (5Schorey J.S. Holsti M.A. Ratliff T.L. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These data suggest an important role for FAP-A-(269–292) in FAP-mediated fibronectin binding. In the present study, the amino acids required for fibronectin binding of the FAP-A-(269–292) peptide were determined using Ala substitutions in synthetic peptides and site-directed mutagenesis of the recombinant protein. The data show that four amino acids, RWFV, are necessary for fibronectin binding function. The FAP-A peptides were synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography as described (5Schorey J.S. Holsti M.A. Ratliff T.L. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The fn binding to FAP-A peptides was as described (5Schorey J.S. Holsti M.A. Ratliff T.L. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, immulon 2 microtiter 96-well plates were coated with FAP peptides, 0.36 mm for Fig. 1 and the given concentration for Fig. 2. Nonspecific sites were blocked with bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg of fn or laminin (LN) in wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20) was added per well. After a 3-h incubation at 25° C, wells were washed with wash buffer and bound fn and LN were detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-fn or anti-LN, respectively. Bound antibody was detected using anti-rabbit Ig coupled to horseradish peroxidase.Figure 2Effect of Ala substitution on fibronectin binding of FAP-(269–280) peptides.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For each mutant FAP-A DNA, one pair of complementary oligonucleotide primers containing GCC (code for alanine) substitution or nucleotide deletion at the desired site were used to generate two DNA fragments having overlapping ends with primary polymerase chain reaction. Then these fragments were combined for secondary polymerase chain reaction. The resultant mutant FAP-A DNAs were cloned into pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced using the Taq DyeDeoxy Termination Cycle Kit and the Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All mutant FAP-A DNAs were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and then ligated into the expression vector pTrcHisB. The mutant FAP-A fusion proteins containing poly-His tag were expressed and purified using a Ni2+ affinity column under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The cell lysates and purified fusion proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. M. bovis BCG attachment was performed as described previously (5Schorey J.S. Holsti M.A. Ratliff T.L. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Immulon 4 microtiter plates (96-well) were coated overnight at 4° C with 100 μl of 60 μg/ml fibronectin or 120 μg/ml human serum albumin. After blocking nonspecific sites with human serum albumin, a total of 2 × 106 colony forming units of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled M. bovis BCG were added in a volume of 50 μl of 0.05 m Tris buffer (pH 6.2). In blocking experiments, 1 μm recombinant FAP-A protein was added in a volume of 50 μl of 0.05 m Tris buffer before the addition of M. bovis BCG. After a 90-min incubation at 37° C, the wells were washed with 0.05 m Tris buffer and bound fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled M. bovis BCG were detected using a FL500 Fluorescence Plate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Frederick, MD). Previous studies identified two regions in FAP-A that possessed the capacity to bind fibronectin (5Schorey J.S. Holsti M.A. Ratliff T.L. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These regions consisted of amino acids 177–201 (FAP-A-(177–201)) and amino acids 269–292 (FAP-A-(269–292)). Characterization of the peptides showed that FAP-A-(269–292) was sufficient to block the interaction of mycobacteria with fibronectin-coated surfaces, mycobacterial attachment to epithelial cells, and M. bovis BCG-mediated antitumor activity (4Schorey J.S. Li Q. McCourt D.W. Bong-Mastek M. Clark-Curtiss J.E. Ratliff T.L. Brown E.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2652-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schorey J.S. Holsti M.A. Ratliff T.L. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).2 Therefore we initiated studies on FAP-A-(269–292) to determine the amino acids required for fibronectin binding. Initially we tested synthetic peptides of varying lengths to determine the minimal peptide length necessary for binding to fibronectin. Truncation of FAP-A-(269–292) from the amino-terminal end abrogated binding activity quickly suggesting that this region played an important role in fibronectin binding (Fig.1 A). Truncation from the carboxyl-terminal end showed that the minimal peptide length supporting fibronectin binding was amino acids 269–280 (FAP-A-(269–280), Fig.1 B). No binding function was observed for a peptide containing amino acids 269–277. Further studies were performed to identify the essential amino acids within FAP-A-(269–280). To determine the essential amino acids, peptides were synthesized that contained single Ala substitutions as shown in Fig. 2 A. Each peptide was tested for binding capacity to fibronectin as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2). The data show that amino acids 273–276 are essential for fibronectin binding (Fig. 2, Band C). Ala substitution of any one of these amino acids completely abrogated fibronectin binding activity. Substitution of amino acids 269–272, 277, and 279 had no effect on the fibronectin binding capacity of FAP-A-(269–280) (Fig. 2 C). Ala substitution of amino acid 278 produced partial inhibition of binding and amino acid 280 reproducibly enhanced the fibronectin binding capacity of the FAP-A-(269–280) peptide (Fig. 2 C). Comparison of binding regions for cloned FAP proteins shows 100% homology among the essential amino acids (RWFV; Fig.2 D). We previously reported the ability of the synthetic FAP-A-(269–292) peptide to inhibit the attachment ofM. bovis BCG to fibronectin-coated surfaces (5Schorey J.S. Holsti M.A. Ratliff T.L. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here we tested the wild type minimal binding peptide (FAP-A-(269–280)) and FAP-A-(269–280) with individual Ala substitution (at amino acid 269, 273, 274, 275, 276, or 280) for their ability to inhibit M. bovis BCG attachment to fibronectin. When compared with wild type peptide (FAP-A-(269–292)), peptides with Ala substitution within the active region identified above either partially (Ala274–276) or completely (Ala273) abrogated the ability of the respective peptides to block M. bovis BCG attachment (Fig. 3, A andB). The relative activity of peptides with Ala substitutions at 274–276 varied from experiment to experiment although the data consistently showed partial abrogation of activity for each. Therefore, we show the mean percent inhibition of all experiments (three in number) in Fig. 3 B. These data show the reproducibility of the effects of Ala substitution. In all experiments control peptides containing Ala substitution at either amino acid 269 or 280 had no significant effect on peptide function (Fig. 3, A andB). To determine the effect of Ala substitution on fibronectin binding activity at the FAP-A fusion protein level, a truncated form of FAP-A consisting of amino acids 210–381 (FAP-A-(210–381)), which contains the FAP-A-(269–292) binding region, was used. Residues 269, 273, 274, 275, 276, and 280 were selected for individual Ala substitution (Fig.4 A). In addition the four identified active amino acids, RWFV (amino acids 273–276), were either deleted en bloc or substituted en bloc with Ala. As a control for the RWFV deletion and the en bloc Ala substitution, four residues outside the identified fibronectin binding region, NGQI (amino acids 255–257), were either deleted or substituted with Ala. The sequences of all mutated FAP-A DNAs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. FAP-A mutants were subcloned into the pTrcHis expression vector and expressed, and the resultant fusion proteins were purified as described (4Schorey J.S. Li Q. McCourt D.W. Bong-Mastek M. Clark-Curtiss J.E. Ratliff T.L. Brown E.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2652-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schorey J.S. Holsti M.A. Ratliff T.L. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Coomassie Blue staining showed the induced fusion proteins to correspond to the correct molecular weight (data not shown). The effect of mutant FAP-A proteins on M. bovis BCG attachment to fibronectin was tested, and a representative experiment showing M. bovis BCG attachment is provided in Fig.4 B. Fig. 4 C shows the mean percent inhibition from three independent experiments of M. bovis BCG binding by the FAP-A mutants. Mutant FAP-A with a single Ala substitution at either amino acid 269 (FAP-A269) or 280 (FAP-A280) showed no alteration in peptide function (Fig.4, B and C). In contrast FAP-A mutants with Ala substitutions at amino acids 273 (FAP-A273A), 274 (FAP-A274A), 275 (FAP-A275A), and 276 (FAP-A276A) showed partial abrogation of the ability of each peptide to inhibit M. bovis BCG attachment to fibronectin. When the four essential amino acids (RWFV) were either all changed to Ala (FAP-A4ala-(273–276)) or deleted (FAP-A4d-(273–276)), no functional activity of the respective peptides was observed (Fig. 4,B and C). The control mutants in which the four amino acids outside the fibronectin binding region were substituted with Ala (NGQI, amino acids 255–258, FAP-A4ala-(255–258)) or deleted (FAP-A4d-(255–258)) retained functional activity. These data indicate that one Ala substitution within the RWFV motif is not sufficient to completely abrogate fibronectin binding function in the recombinant FAP-A protein; however, the en bloc deletion of RWFV or Ala substitution of the RWFV motif resulted in complete loss of fibronectin binding activity. These data demonstrate RWFV to be critical to the fibronectin binding function of mycobacterial FAP. We performed studies to identify the amino acids necessary for fibronectin binding of FAP. Because previous studies demonstrated the FAP-A-(269–292) fibronectin binding peptide to be sufficient to block mycobacterial interaction with fibronectin, this site in FAP-A was characterized. The minimal binding sequence of FAP-A for fibronectin, consisting of 12 amino acids (amino acids 269–280), was identified. Using this binding sequence as a base, a panel of synthetic peptides containing single Ala substitutions was used to determine which amino acids were necessary for fibronectin binding (Fig. 2, B andC). Characterization of the functional effects of single Ala substitutions in the synthetic peptides showed that substitution at amino acids 273–276 abrogated peptide binding to fibronectin (Fig. 2,B and C). In a more stringent test of the biological effects of Ala substitutions at amino acids 273–276, Ala-modified synthetic peptides were tested for their ability to block attachment of M. bovis BCG to fibronectin. Single Ala substitutions at Trp, Phe, or Val partially inhibited M. bovis BCG attachment whereas Ala substitution at the Arg site completely abrogated M. bovis BCG binding (Fig. 3,A and B). The amino acids RWFV are 100% conserved in all FAP molecules identified to date (Fig. 2 D). These data show that the RWFV motif is essential for peptide binding to fibronectin and also is important in the M. bovisBCG/fibronectin interaction. To validate the synthetic peptide data, additional studies were performed in which mutant recombinant proteins containing Ala substitutions or amino acid deletions were tested for fibronectin binding function. In these studies the ability of mutated recombinant FAP-A-(210–381) to inhibit M. bovis BCG binding to fn was compared with wild type FAP-A-(210–381). FAP-A mutants with single Ala substitutions at amino acids 273–276 showed partial inhibition ofM. bovis BCG attachment to fibronectin. The Ala mutation of Arg at position 273 in recombinant FAP-(210–381) did not result in complete abrogation of function as was seen in the synthetic peptide. This suggests that the function of Arg273 was exaggerated in the shorter synthetic peptide. FAP-A mutants in which all four relevant amino acids (273–276) were simultaneously mutated to Ala or were simultaneously deleted showed complete loss of function. Control proteins in which Ala deletion or substitution was performed at a site outside the fibronectin binding region (amino acids 255–258, NGQI) retained function. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the RWFV sequence is a critical functional motif in FAP binding to fibronectin. Moreover, because the RWFV motif was shown to be important in modulating M. bovis BCG attachment to fibronectin, the data suggest an important role for the motif in the M. bovis BCG/fibronectin interaction. A second protein family, the antigen 85 complex, also has been implicated in the fibronectin binding of mycobacteria. Abou-Zeidet al. (8Abou-Zeid C. Ratliff T.L. Wiker H.G. Harboe M. Bennedsen J.

Dis. 1990; 141: 830-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A highly conserved motif among the antigen 85 complex proteins, FEWYYQ, was identified as an important sequence in the binding of recombinant 85 complex proteins to fibronectin (12Naito M. Ohara N. Matsumoto S. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2905-2909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). While the interaction between antigen 85 complex proteins and fibronectin has been demonstrated in in vitrobinding assays, the role of these proteins in the attachment of viable bacteria to fibronectin has not been established. The relationship between the antigen 85 complex and FAP in the mycobacterial interaction with fibronectin is not known. The minimal amino acid sequence that will bind fibronectin was identified for the 85B protein and consists of 11 amino acids (FEWYYQSGLSV) (12Naito M. Ohara N. Matsumoto S. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2905-2909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The amino acid composition of this binding peptide consists of 8 polar and 3 non-polar amino acids with a neutral net charge. Essential amino acids in the minimal binding sequence were identified as FEWYYQ, which has a net negative charge. FAP contains no region of homology with the identified 85B binding region. Furthermore, the composition of the minimal amino acid sequence of the FAP fibronectin binding region, which consists of 12 amino acids, is quite distinct from that of the 85B sequence. The FAP minimal binding peptide consists of 7 polar and 5 non-polar amino acids with a net positive charge. Moreover, the essential binding motif of this binding region, RWFV, bears little resemblance to the 85B sequence, FEWYYQ. The FAP sequence is highly non-polar and is positively charged while the 85B sequence is negatively charged and is comprised of 2 non-polar and 3 polar amino acids. The composition of the respective binding sites for antigen 85B and FAP suggest distinct function. In this regard, a previous report localized the binding site on fibronectin for 85B to be in the collagen binding region at the amino-terminal end of fibronectin (11Peake P. Gooley A. Britton W.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4828-4834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, the interaction between 85B and fibronectin was inhibited by gelatin. In contrast, our unpublished studies show that both FAP and intact M. bovis BCG attach to the carboxyl-terminal region of fibronectin containing the heparin binding site. In collaborative studies with Dr. James McCarthy (University of Minnesota), we have shown M. bovis BCG and FAP to bind to the 33/66 fragment of a trypsin/cathepsin D digest of fibronectin. In addition, previous studies showed M. bovisBCG attachment to fibronectin to be inhibited by heparin but not gelatin (2Kavoussi L.R. Ruesing R.A. Hudson M.A. Catalona W.J. Ratliff T.L. J. Urol. 1989; 142: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Comparison of FAP and protein 85B with other bacterial fibronectin attachment proteins suggests that FAP exhibits unique properties, whereas protein 85B shares many characteristics with these proteins. The best characterized of the fibronectin-binding proteins is that ofStaphylococcus. The primary fibronectin binding sequence ofStaphylococcus aureus is located in the 37–48 amino acid sequence that is repeated four times in the binding protein (16McGavin M.J. Raucci G. Gurusiddappa S. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8343-8347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The essential binding motif is a negatively charged hydrophilic motif, DFEEDT, and is shared by other Gram-positive cocci for which fibronectin attachment proteins have been identified (17Joh H.J. House-Pompeo K. Patti J.M. Gurusiddappa S. Hook M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6086-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The negative charge and the hydrophilic nature of the Staphylococcusfibronectin binding protein is similar to the characteristics of the identified fibronectin binding sequence for the mycobacterial 85B protein. In addition, the region in the fibronectin molecule to which the Staphylococcus protein binds is located in the same collagen binding region as 85B (11Peake P. Gooley A. Britton W.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4828-4834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16McGavin M.J. Raucci G. Gurusiddappa S. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8343-8347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The studies we report here identify and characterize a fibronectin binding region of FAP-A. The data show that FAP-A binding depends on the RWFV sequence, which possesses characteristics distinct from antigen 85B and fibronectin-binding proteins of Gram-positive cocci. Further studies are needed to characterize the respective roles of FAP and the antigen 85 complex in mycobacterial attachment to fibronectin."

PsbDis transcribed from at least three different promoters, one which is activated by high fluence blue light. Sequences within 130 base pairs (bp) of the psbD blue light-responsive promoter (BLRP) are highly conserved in higher plants. In this study, the structure of thepsbD BLRP was analyzed in detail using deletion and site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro transcription. Deletion analysis showed that a 53-bp DNA region of thepsbD BLRP, from −57 to −5, was sufficient for transcription in vitro. Mutation of a putative prokaryotic −10 element (TATTCT) located from −7 to −12 inhibited transcription from the psbD BLRP. In contrast, mutation of a putative prokaryotic −35 element, had no influence on transcription. Mutation of a TATATA sequence located between the barley psbA −10 and −35 elements significantly reduced transcription from this promoter. However, site-directed mutation of sequences located between −35 and −10 had no effect on transcription from the psbDBLRP. Transcription from the psbD BLRP was previously shown to require a 22-bp sequence, termed the AAG-box, located between −36 and −57. The AAG-box specifically binds the protein complex AGF. Site-directed mutagenesis identified two different sequence motifs in the AAG-box that are important for transcription in vitro. Based on these results, we propose that positive factors bind to the AAG-box and interact with the chloroplast-encoded RNA polymerase to promote transcription from the psbD BLRP. Transcription from the psbD BLRP is thus similar to type II bacterial promoters that use activating proteins to stimulate transcription. Transcription of the psbD BLRP was ∼6.5-fold greater in plastid extracts from illuminated versus dark-grown plants. This suggests that light-induced activation of this promoter in vivo involves factors interacting with the 53-bp psbDBLRP in vitro.

Photosystem II contains at least four plastid-encoded chlorophyll apoproteins (D1, D2, CP47, CP43). Among these, D2 and D1 form a heterodimer, which houses the photosystem II reaction center chlorophyll P680. D1 and D2 are relatively unstable in illuminated plants (1Mattoo A.K. Hoffman-Falk H.

One of thepsbD promoters is activated when plants are illuminated by high fluence blue light but not by red or far-red illumination (5Christopher D.A. Mullet J.E.

The conserved psbD BLRP contains sequences with significant similarity to typical prokaryotic −10 and −35 promoter regions (13Sexton T.B. Jones J.T. Mullet J.E. Curr.

Mullet J.E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the AAG-box and its cognate DNA-binding protein complex, AGF, are required for transcription from the barleypsbD BLRP in vitro (34Kim M. Mullet J.E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DNA region containing the PGT and AAG-boxes was shown to be important for transcription from the tobacco psbD BLRP in vivo(40Allison L.A. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3721-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the present study, we define a minimal DNA region required for transcription of the barley psbD BLRP and further dissect the architecture of the promoter using deletion, insertion, and point mutation analyses.

The conserved psbD BLRP contains sequences with significant similarity to typical prokaryotic −10 and −35 promoter regions (13Sexton T.B. Jones J.T. Mullet J.E. Curr.

Mullet J.E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the AAG-box and its cognate DNA-binding protein complex, AGF, are required for transcription from the barleypsbD BLRP in vitro (34Kim M. Mullet J.E.

Furthermore, the DNA region containing the PGT and AAG-boxes was shown to be important for transcription from the tobacco psbD BLRP in vivo(40Allison L.A. Maliga P.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of hCCR2, we cloned and sequenced the hCCR2 gene; it was approximately 8 kilobase pairs in length and consisted of three exons divided by two introns.

The hCCR2 gene has been cloned, and the mechanism of how it produces two alternatively spliced variants that differ only in their carboxyl-terminal tail has been elucidated (10Wong L.-M. Myers S.J.

In addition, hCCR2 and hCCR3 have been implicated as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 co-receptors in certain cell types (13Doranz B.J. Rucker J. Yi Y. Smyth R.J. Samson M. Peiper S.C.

Nature. 1997; 385: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar).We previously reported that tumor-associated macrophages attracted by MCP-1 inhibit the growth of transplanted rat tumors in vivo(15Yamashiro S. Takeya M. Nishi T. Kuratsu J. Yoshimura T. Ushio Y. Takahashi K. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 856-867PubMed Google Scholar). We posited that if we could stimulate the expression of MCP-1 in tumors and the expression of hCCR2 in monocytes, we would be able to obtain a greater inhibitory effect by a larger number of infiltrated macrophages against the growth of MCP-1-producing tumors such as human malignant glioma. The treatment of malignant tumors by the enhancement of an intrinsic immune system may be possible. The promoter region of the human MCP-1 gene has already been analyzed; it contains a distal nuclear factor κB binding site for induction by interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor α, and a proximal GC box for basal transcriptional activity that is important for the transcriptional activation of MCP-1 (16Ueda A. Okuda K. Ohno S. Shirai A. Igarashi T. Matsunaga K. Fukushima J. Kawamoto S. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2052-2063PubMed Google Scholar). However, the promoter region for thehCCR2 gene remains to be characterized.To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate hCCR2, we cloned the hCCR2 gene, sequenced approximately 1.7 kbp of the 5′-flanking region, and mapped the transcription initiation site. We also assessed the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region using luciferase (Luc) assays and gel mobility shift assays. We found that the Oct-1 binding sequence located 36 bp upstream from the TATA box and the tandem CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) binding sequences located at +50 to +77 within the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) are essential for the transcriptional activation and the tissue specificity of hCCR2 expression.DISCUSSIONIn the present work, we isolated and functionally characterized the 5′-flanking region of the hCCR2 gene to elucidate its regulatory mechanism. The structural analysis disclosed that the proximal 5′-flanking region of this gene contained a classic TATA box, a CAAT box, and clustered consensus sequences for tissue-specificcis-regulatory elements, i.e. the GATA binding sequence, Oct-1 binding sequence, and C/EBP binding motifs. This is compatible with the fact that the hCCR2 gene is not a housekeeping gene and is regulated in a cell-specific manner.Among the members of the CCR family, only the promoter region for hCCR5 has been isolated and functionally characterized to date (23Mummidi S. Ahuja S.S. McDaniel B.L. Ahuja S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30662-30671Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The transcription of the hCCR5 gene was initiated by two different promoters, and both proximal and distal promoters lack the canonical TATA or CAAT box. Instead, they contain the consensus sequence for several transcriptional factors such as Oct-1 and multiple motifs for GATA-1, which are also observed in the hCCR2gene. It is interesting that these closely related genes have rather different transcriptional initiations, although they are thought to share the same ancestral gene.The Luc assay using various deletion mutants of the hCCR2promoter region demonstrated that at least four regions are important for the constitutive expression of hCCR2 in THP-1 cells: (a) −429 to −186 for activation, (b) −185 to −123 for repression, (c) −89 to −59 for activation, and (d) +36 to +118 for cell specificity and activation. Among these four regions, we focused on the latter two, because the deletion mutant containing only these regions (−89 to +118) was sufficient for the basal expression and tissue specificity.The gel mobility shift assay and mutagenesis demonstrated that Oct-1 bound mainly to the octamer consensus sequence (ATGCAAAT) located in the third region (from −89 to −59) and was probably responsible for the trans-activation of this region. Although Oct-1 is ubiquitously expressed (24Schaffner W. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 37-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it is reduced or under the detectable level in CCR2-negative cell lines (J-111 and U-251 MG cells) (Fig. 8). This suggests that Oct-1 plays a certain role in the tissue-specific expression of hCCR2.The most important cis-acting element was located at a rather unusual position, the 5′-UTR of the hCCR2 gene (+36 to +118). It has been reported that the 5′-UTR could regulate the expression of genes in two different ways, one of which is that the 5′-UTR can work as a tissue-specific active translational enhancer taking a stable stem and loop structure; examples are the human γ-glutamyl transferase gene (25Diederich M. Wellman M. Visvikis A. Puga A. Siest G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the thymidine kinase gene (26Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Cell. 1985; 40: 515-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), the glutathione peroxidase gene (27Kurata H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the ornithine decarboxylase gene (28Kashiwagi K. Ito K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Stable secondary structures were predicted between +12 and +118 of the hCCR2 gene, presenting the free energy formation of −43.6 kcal/mol. However, the present Northern blot analysis indicated that the hCCR2 gene is regulated at least at the transcriptional level in various cell lines (Fig. 4). Therefore, we should focus on the other mechanism, the transcriptional activity of the 5′-UTR, which has been demonstrated in the human plasminogen gene (29Meroni G. Buraggi G. Taramelli R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the Aγ-globin gene (30Amrolia P.J. Cunningham J.M. Ney P. Nienhuis A.W. Jane S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12892-12898Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), indicating that the transcriptional factor bound to a specific region within 5′-UTR.We particularly noted the position near +75, where two putative C/EBP binding sequences were located in tandem, because pGL3-0.18KΔE, which partially disrupted the C/EBP binding consensus, reduced the Luc activity by nearly 60%. The gel mobility shift assay using a 73-bp fragment containing tandem C/EBP binding sequences as a probe detected three prominent bands. Competition using the C/EBP consensus sequence and the supershift assay demonstrated that each band was related to C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ. Finally, the introduction of mutation in each motif disclosed that site 1 was the most important site for the tissue-specific expression of hCCR2.The C/EBP family of transcriptional factors is involved in tissue-specific gene expression in adipocytes, hepatocytes, and monocyte/macrophages (31Wedel A. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In particular, target genes for C/EBP include acute phase response genes in liver cells and cytokine genes in monocytes/macrophages (31Wedel A. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Our present results demonstrate that CCR2-negative cells (J-111 and U-251 cells) had considerably reduced expression of the C/EBP family (Fig. 8). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the C/EBP binding sequence located in the 5′-UTR can regulate the expression of hCCR2 in a monocyte-specific manner.It is interesting that C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ contribute to the lipopolysaccharide response of MCP-1, the ligand of CCR2 (32Bretz J.D. Williams S.C. Baer M. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7306-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). MCP-1 and CCR2 are probably coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level by the C/EBP family for effective immune responses. The tumor cytotoxicity of macrophages from C/EBPβ knockout mice was severely impaired (33Tanaka T. Akira S. Yoshida K. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji N. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that the growth of MCP-1-producing tumors was inhibited by the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (15Yamashiro S. Takeya M. Nishi T. Kuratsu J. Yoshimura T. Ushio Y. Takahashi K. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 856-867PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that MCP-1 and CCR2 may play an important role in the cytotoxicity of macrophages in cancer. Although we were unable to identify the stimulation that effectively induces the expression of hCCR2, our present findings provide a useful foundation for further studies.

In addition, hCCR2 and hCCR3 have been implicated as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 co-receptors in certain cell types (13Doranz B.J. Rucker J. Yi Y. Smyth R.J. Samson M. Peiper S.C.

We previously reported that tumor-associated macrophages attracted by MCP-1 inhibit the growth of transplanted rat tumors in vivo(15Yamashiro S. Takeya M. Nishi T. Kuratsu J. Yoshimura T. Ushio Y. Takahashi K. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 856-867PubMed Google Scholar). We posited that if we could stimulate the expression of MCP-1 in tumors and the expression of hCCR2 in monocytes, we would be able to obtain a greater inhibitory effect by a larger number of infiltrated macrophages against the growth of MCP-1-producing tumors such as human malignant glioma. The treatment of malignant tumors by the enhancement of an intrinsic immune system may be possible. The promoter region of the human MCP-1 gene has already been analyzed; it contains a distal nuclear factor κB binding site for induction by interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor α, and a proximal GC box for basal transcriptional activity that is important for the transcriptional activation of MCP-1 (16Ueda A. Okuda K. Ohno S. Shirai A. Igarashi T. Matsunaga K. Fukushima J. Kawamoto S. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2052-2063PubMed Google Scholar). However, the promoter region for thehCCR2 gene remains to be characterized. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate hCCR2, we cloned the hCCR2 gene, sequenced approximately 1.7 kbp of the 5′-flanking region, and mapped the transcription initiation site. We also assessed the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region using luciferase (Luc) assays and gel mobility shift assays. We found that the Oct-1 binding sequence located 36 bp upstream from the TATA box and the tandem CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) binding sequences located at +50 to +77 within the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) are essential for the transcriptional activation and the tissue specificity of hCCR2 expression. DISCUSSIONIn the present work, we isolated and functionally characterized the 5′-flanking region of the hCCR2 gene to elucidate its regulatory mechanism. The structural analysis disclosed that the proximal 5′-flanking region of this gene contained a classic TATA box, a CAAT box, and clustered consensus sequences for tissue-specificcis-regulatory elements, i.e. the GATA binding sequence, Oct-1 binding sequence, and C/EBP binding motifs. This is compatible with the fact that the hCCR2 gene is not a housekeeping gene and is regulated in a cell-specific manner.Among the members of the CCR family, only the promoter region for hCCR5 has been isolated and functionally characterized to date (23Mummidi S. Ahuja S.S. McDaniel B.L. Ahuja S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30662-30671Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The transcription of the hCCR5 gene was initiated by two different promoters, and both proximal and distal promoters lack the canonical TATA or CAAT box. Instead, they contain the consensus sequence for several transcriptional factors such as Oct-1 and multiple motifs for GATA-1, which are also observed in the hCCR2gene. It is interesting that these closely related genes have rather different transcriptional initiations, although they are thought to share the same ancestral gene.The Luc assay using various deletion mutants of the hCCR2promoter region demonstrated that at least four regions are important for the constitutive expression of hCCR2 in THP-1 cells: (a) −429 to −186 for activation, (b) −185 to −123 for repression, (c) −89 to −59 for activation, and (d) +36 to +118 for cell specificity and activation. Among these four regions, we focused on the latter two, because the deletion mutant containing only these regions (−89 to +118) was sufficient for the basal expression and tissue specificity.The gel mobility shift assay and mutagenesis demonstrated that Oct-1 bound mainly to the octamer consensus sequence (ATGCAAAT) located in the third region (from −89 to −59) and was probably responsible for the trans-activation of this region. Although Oct-1 is ubiquitously expressed (24Schaffner W. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 37-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it is reduced or under the detectable level in CCR2-negative cell lines (J-111 and U-251 MG cells) (Fig. 8). This suggests that Oct-1 plays a certain role in the tissue-specific expression of hCCR2.The most important cis-acting element was located at a rather unusual position, the 5′-UTR of the hCCR2 gene (+36 to +118). It has been reported that the 5′-UTR could regulate the expression of genes in two different ways, one of which is that the 5′-UTR can work as a tissue-specific active translational enhancer taking a stable stem and loop structure; examples are the human γ-glutamyl transferase gene (25Diederich M. Wellman M. Visvikis A. Puga A. Siest G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the thymidine kinase gene (26Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Cell. 1985; 40: 515-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), the glutathione peroxidase gene (27Kurata H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the ornithine decarboxylase gene (28Kashiwagi K. Ito K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Stable secondary structures were predicted between +12 and +118 of the hCCR2 gene, presenting the free energy formation of −43.6 kcal/mol. However, the present Northern blot analysis indicated that the hCCR2 gene is regulated at least at the transcriptional level in various cell lines (Fig. 4). Therefore, we should focus on the other mechanism, the transcriptional activity of the 5′-UTR, which has been demonstrated in the human plasminogen gene (29Meroni G. Buraggi G. Taramelli R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the Aγ-globin gene (30Amrolia P.J. Cunningham J.M. Ney P. Nienhuis A.W. Jane S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12892-12898Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), indicating that the transcriptional factor bound to a specific region within 5′-UTR.We particularly noted the position near +75, where two putative C/EBP binding sequences were located in tandem, because pGL3-0.18KΔE, which partially disrupted the C/EBP binding consensus, reduced the Luc activity by nearly 60%. The gel mobility shift assay using a 73-bp fragment containing tandem C/EBP binding sequences as a probe detected three prominent bands. Competition using the C/EBP consensus sequence and the supershift assay demonstrated that each band was related to C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ. Finally, the introduction of mutation in each motif disclosed that site 1 was the most important site for the tissue-specific expression of hCCR2.The C/EBP family of transcriptional factors is involved in tissue-specific gene expression in adipocytes, hepatocytes, and monocyte/macrophages (31Wedel A. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In particular, target genes for C/EBP include acute phase response genes in liver cells and cytokine genes in monocytes/macrophages (31Wedel A. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Our present results demonstrate that CCR2-negative cells (J-111 and U-251 cells) had considerably reduced expression of the C/EBP family (Fig. 8). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the C/EBP binding sequence located in the 5′-UTR can regulate the expression of hCCR2 in a monocyte-specific manner.It is interesting that C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ contribute to the lipopolysaccharide response of MCP-1, the ligand of CCR2 (32Bretz J.D. Williams S.C. Baer M. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7306-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). MCP-1 and CCR2 are probably coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level by the C/EBP family for effective immune responses. The tumor cytotoxicity of macrophages from C/EBPβ knockout mice was severely impaired (33Tanaka T. Akira S. Yoshida K. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji N. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that the growth of MCP-1-producing tumors was inhibited by the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (15Yamashiro S. Takeya M. Nishi T. Kuratsu J. Yoshimura T. Ushio Y. Takahashi K. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 856-867PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that MCP-1 and CCR2 may play an important role in the cytotoxicity of macrophages in cancer.

Enzyme forms differ in respect to their oxidizing substrates; XDH prefers NAD to molecular oxygen, whereas XO only reacts significantly with oxygen. The preference for oxidizing substrate is partially explained by thermodynamics. Unlike XDH, the midpoint potential of the FAD, the center at which oxygen and NAD react, is too high in XO to efficiently reduce NAD (Hunt, J., Massey, V., Dunham, W.R., and Sands, R.H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 18685–18691). To distinguish between changes in thermodynamics and in substrate binding, samples of both XO and XDH have been prepared in which the native FAD has been replaced with an FAD analog of different redox potential, 1-deaza-FAD or 8-CN-FAD. Reductive titrations indicate that both 1-deaza-XO and 1-deaza-XDH have a flavin midpoint potential similar to native XDH and that 8-CN-XO and 8-CN-XDH each have a flavin potential higher than XO. Both the low potential 1-deaza-XO and the high potential 8-CN-XDH contain essentially no xanthine/NAD activity. However, 1-deaza-XDH does exhibit xanthine/NAD activity, and 8-CN-XO has normal xanthine/oxygen activity.The binding of NAD to oxidized XO and XDH was investigated by ultrafiltration and isothermal titration calorimetry. TheK d for the binding of NAD to XDH was determined to be 280 ± 145 μm by ultrafiltration and 160 ± 40 μm by isothermal titration calorimetry. No evidence for the binding of NAD to XO by either method could be obtained. A low flavin midpoint potential is necessary but not sufficient for dehydrogenase activity.

XDH contains an NAD-binding site adjacent to the FAD, as addition of the NAD analog aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide causes marked perturbations of the visible spectrum of XDH (19Nishino T.

In contrast, no spectral changes occur on the addition of either compound to oxidized XO. The redox potential of the FAD/FADH2 couple in XDH, −340 mV (20Hunt J. Massey V. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18685-18691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is favorable for the reduction of NAD, −335 mV at pH 7.5 (21Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1976: 414-415Google Scholar). However, the FAD/FADH2 couple in XO, −255 mV (22Porras A.G. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11617-11626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is too high for efficient reduction of NAD. This paper investigates the role of the low redox potential of the FAD/FADH2 couple and the salient NAD-binding site of XDH in conferring reactivity toward NAD as an oxidizing substrate. The midpoint potential of the FAD/FADH2 couple was engineered by replacement of the normal FAD with FAD analogs containing different redox potentials. By reversing the redox potentials of the two enzyme forms, it might be possible to reverse the use of NAD as an oxidizing substrate. The low potential 1-deaza-FAD, −280 mV for the unbound flavin, (23Spencer R. Fisher J. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3586-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used to prepare 1-deaza-XO, an oxidase-type enzyme with a low FAD/FADH2 midpoint potential. Previous work of Hille and Massey (24Hille R. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17401-17408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that 1-deaza-XO has a low flavin potential of −340 mV at the higher pH, 8.5. The recently synthesized 8-CN-FAD has a redox potential of −50 mV (25Murthy Y.V.S.N. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8975-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Preparation of 8-CN-XDH resulted in a dehydrogenase-type enzyme with an FAD/FADH2potential predicted to be too high for efficient NAD reduction. The flavin potentials of these substituted enzymes were determined relative to the 2Fe/2S centers by reductive titrations or by reduction in the presence of suitable redox dyes. Steady-state kinetics of the xanthine/NAD and xanthine/oxygen activities were measured to assess any changes in the preferred oxidizing substrate. As NAD binding experiments have focused on spectral changes of the enzyme on addition of NAD, NAD binding was also assessed by measuring the concentration of unbound NAD in mixtures of NAD and oxidized XO or XDH and by isothermal calorimetry. Note that NAD binding to reduced XDH and XO is more catalytically relevant, but it is not possible to measure in the case of XO. Differences in substrate binding and reactivity are discussed. XDH was purified by the method of Hunt and Massey (18Hunt J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21479-21485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). XO was purified in the same manner but with the omission of dithiothreitol. The preparation of 1-deaza-FAD has been described previously by Spenceret al. (23Spencer R. Fisher J. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3586-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The synthesis and characterization of 8-CN-FAD was performed by Murthy and Massey and has recently been described (25Murthy Y.V.S.N. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8975-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Immediately before use, XDH samples were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with 2.5 mm dithiothreitol. Dithiothreitol was removed by desalting on a Sephadex G-25 column. All experiments were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.3 mm EDTA. Samples of deflavo XO were prepared by the method of Komai et al. (6Komai H. Massey V. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1692-1700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deflavo XDH was prepared in the same manner but with the addition of 2.5 mm dithiothreitol at all stages. The visible spectra and activity of deflavo enzymes indicated greater than 95% removal of FAD. Reconstitution of holoproteins was performed by incubating deflavo enzyme (approximately 20 μm) with a 3-fold excess of the artificial FAD for at least 30 min on ice. Excess flavin was removed by repeated concentration and dilution in a Centricon-100 spin concentrator. Reconstitution of deflavo XO and XDH with normal FAD ensured that native activity could be recovered. Samples of 1-deaza-FAD substituted enzyme were purged of oxygen in anaerobic cuvettes, as described previously (9Harris C.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8370-8379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Photo reductions (26Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) were performed by careful irradiation of anaerobic enzyme in a sample containing 20 mm potassium oxalate and 5-deazaflavin equal to 10% of the enzyme concentration. Dithionite titrations were performed by minute additions of an anaerobic sodium dithionite solution (0.5 mg/ml) from a titrating syringe into an anaerobic solution of enzyme. Titrations are presented as proportionality plots in which the percent absorbance lost at a principally 2Fe/2S wavelength is plotted as a function of the percent absorbance lost at a mostly FAD wavelength. Redox potentials of the enzyme-bound artificial flavins were determined relative to the 2Fe/2S centers by fitting proportionality plots with simulated curves calculated from the Nernst equation, the known redox potentials of 2Fe/2S I and 2Fe/2S II, and the extinction changes of the iron-sulfur and FAD centers. The fraction of each center reduced was calculated at a given system potential, E. Percent spectral changes were calculated by dividing the sum of absorbance changes for each center by the total absorbance change reached at full reduction, Fraction(fr.)reduced at FAD wavelength=Equation 1 (Δɛ2Fe/2S)(fr.2Fe/2S Ired+fr.2Fe/2S IIred)+(ΔɛFADH°)(fr.FADH°)+(ΔɛFADH2)(fr.FADH2)2Δɛ2Fe/2S+ΔɛFADH2 where the extinction changes (Δε) are at the FAD wavelength. The fraction reduced at the primarily 2Fe/2S wavelength was calculated in the same way but with the corresponding extinction changes. Concentrations of 2Fe/2S Ired, 2Fe/2S IIred, FADH°, and FADH2 were calculated as follows from the system potential, E, and the known potentials,E° (19Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5468-5473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed.

This method relies on the assumption that the potentials of the 2Fe/2S centers are unchanged by flavin substitution. The method is accurate insofar as the potential of the FAD is not too far removed from the 2Fe/2S potentials (E° 2Fe/2S I= −310 mV, andE° 2Fe/2S II= −235 mV (22Porras A.G. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11617-11626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Anaerobic 8-CN-FAD-substituted XO was photo-reduced stepwise as above in the presence of the indicator dye indigotrisulfonate (20 μm,E m at pH 7.5 = −96 mV). The extent of reduction of the dye was estimated from its absorbance change at 600 nm, where XO shows negligible absorbance changes. The extent of reduction of the enzyme was estimated at 492 nm, an isosbestic point for the reduction of indigotrisulfonate. To calculate the difference between the redox potential of indigodisulfonate and that of the enzyme-bound 8-CN-FAD, the log(ox/red) of the indicator was plottedversus the log(ox/red) of the enzyme-bound 8-CN-FAD according to the method of Minneart (27Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a method previously utilized for the measurement of the redox potentials of native XDH (20Hunt J. Massey V. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18685-18691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1-ml samples of 8-CN-FAD-substituted XDH containing an appropriate indicator dye (indigodisulfonate, indigotrisulfonate, or 1-HO-phenazine) plus 3 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase plus 2 μm benzyl viologen were purged of oxygen in an anaerobic cuvette with 2 side arms by gentle agitation under a constant stream of oxygen-free argon for 20 min. The visible spectrum was then recorded. To begin reduction of the XDH by an NADPH generating system, 0.1 μm NADP and 5 mm glucose 6-phosphate were tipped in from the side arms. The solution was thoroughly mixed in the main cuvette, and the reaction was followed by recording visible spectra at 25 °C with time as the NADPH generating system slowly reduced the XDH. For indigodisulfonate, the extent of reduction of the dye was estimated by the decrease in absorbance at 612 nm, where the enzyme gives rise to less than 5% of the total absorbance change under the conditions used, and the extent of reduction of the flavin was estimated at 463 nm, which is isosbestic for the dye reduction. For indigotrisulfonate, the extent of reduction of the dye was estimated by the extent of decrease in absorbance at 600 nm, where the enzyme gives rise to less than 5% of the total absorbance change, and the extent of reduction of the flavin was estimated from the change in absorbance at 460 nm after the absorbance changes because of the dye were subtracted. For 1-hydroxyphenazine, the extent of reduction of the dye was estimated by the decrease in absorbance at 372 nm. At this wavelength, absorbance changes associated with formation and reduction of the flavin semiquinone of 8-CN-XDH are negligible. Absorbance changes at this wavelength associated with the 2Fe/2S centers of the enzyme were subtracted. The reduction of FADH° was monitored at 620 nm, where 1-hydroxyphenazine does not absorb in either its oxidized or reduced forms. Steady-state kinetics were measured with a Hi-Tech SF-61 and with a Kinetics Instruments stopped-flow spectrophotometer, wherein excellent control of oxygen concentration can be maintained. The method of initial rates was used. Xanthine/oxygen turnover was measured by the increase in urate concentration at 295 nm (Δε = 9,600 m−1cm−1). Xanthine/NAD turnover was measured anaerobically as the increase in NADH concentration at 340 nm (Δε = 6,200m−1 cm−1). Concentrations of xanthine (2–80 μm) and NAD (2–80 μm) or molecular oxygen (31–1220 μm) were varied independently. The enzyme concentration was between 0.1 and 0.5 μm. The enzyme concentration was corrected for inactive enzyme; the fraction of active enzyme was measured as the fraction of absorbance lost within a few s on anaerobic addition of 200 μm xanthine relative to that lost on addition of excess sodium dithionite. Assays with NAD analogs were performed at fixed concentrations: 100 μmxanthine and 500 μm pyridine dinucleotide. The wavelengths monitored and the extinction changes are as follows: thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, Δε395 = 11,300 m−1 cm−1; acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, Δε361 = 9,100m−1 cm−1; pyridine aldehyde adenine dinucleotide, Δε356 = 9,300m−1 cm−1 (28). Native XDH or XO (80 μm) was mixed with varying concentrations of NAD at 25 °C. The sample was put in a Centricon-30 spin concentrator, and was centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 30 min. The concentration of free ligand was taken as the concentration of NAD that passes through the filter. Samples run without enzyme indicated that no NAD was retained by the Centricon filter. NAD was measured by its UV spectrum (ε260 = 17,800 m−1 cm−1). NAD biding was also measured by isothermal titration calorimetry, as described by Wiseman et. al. (29Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar) using enzyme concentrations in the range 100–220 μm. These measurements were kindly made by Dr. Bruce A. Palfey, employing a Calorimetry Sciences Corp. (Provo, Utah) 4200 instrument. Deflavo XO and XDH were prepared by the method of Komaiet al. (6Komai H. Massey V. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1692-1700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The visible spectrum as well as activity assays indicated that greater than 95% of the FAD had been removed (not shown). Mixing deflavo XO with 8-CN-FAD and 1-deaza-FAD yielded enzymes with near-complete flavin reconstitution. The addition of 8-CN-FAD and 1-deaza-FAD to deflavo XDH also resulted in near-complete binding, as shown below. The spectrum of 8-CN-FAD is not significantly changed on binding to deflavo XO or XDH. The extinction at 450 nm of 8-CN-FAD is 9,990m−1 cm−1 (25Murthy Y.V.S.N. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8975-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The spectrum of 8-CN-XO minus that of deflavo XO has an extinction difference of 8,800m−1 cm−1, indicating that only 88% of the 8-CN-XO contains bound flavin. The extinction difference at 450 nm because of 8-CN-FAD binding to deflavo XDH is 9,500m−1 cm−1, indicating 95% bound flavin in the 8-CN-XDH sample. After reconstitution with 8-CN-FAD, the excess flavin was removed from the enzyme samples in a Centricon-100 concentrator. The spectrum of the initial material (enzyme + excess flavin) minus that of the free 8-CN-FAD that had passed through the filter confirmed the extinctions reported here. Spectra of 8-CN-XO and 8-CN-XDH are shown in Figs. 1,A and B, respectively. The spectra of 1-deaza-XO and 1-deaza-XDH are identical to that reported previously for 1-deaza-XO (24Hille R. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17401-17408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference spectra of enzyme-bound minus deflavo enzyme indicated the extinction at 550 nm of bound 1-deaza-FAD to be 9,150 m−1cm−1 for 1-deaza-XO and 9,310 m−1cm−1 for 1-deaza-XDH. These values are quite close to that of 9,700 m−1 cm−1 reported for 1-deaza-XO (24Hille R. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17401-17408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to that of 8,700 m−1cm−1 for the free 1-deaza-FAD (30Ludwig M.L. Schopfer L.M. Metzger A.L. Pattridge K.A. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10364-10375Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These spectral data indicate near-complete binding of 1-deaza-FAD to deflavo XO and XDH. Again, the spectrum of enzyme with excess 1-deaza-FAD minus that of the unbound 1-deaza-FAD support these extinctions. Spectra of 1-deaza-XO and 1-deaza-XDH are shown in Figs. 5, A and B, respectively. The redox potentials of the bound artificial flavins were determined to ensure that the FAD potential had been shifted in the desired direction and amount. Enzyme samples were reduced in very small increments by photo-reduction, by sodium dithionite, or by an NADPH-generating system. Sufficient time (30 to 60 s) was given between irradiations or additions to ensure equilibration. For the 1-deaza-FAD-substituted enzymes, the 2Fe/2S centers were used as redox indicators and are expected to be reduced before the flavin. For the higher potential 8-CN-FAD-substituted enzymes, dye equilibration studies were carried out, as the 2Fe/2S centers were expected to be of too low a potential to be of use as redox indicators. Spectra from the reduction of 7.7 μm 8-CN-XO by sodium dithionite are shown in Fig. 1 A. In addition to spectra of the oxidized and reduced enzyme, the spectrum containing the maximally obtained FADH° is given. The peak at 414 nm indicates this to be the anionic form of 8-CN-FAD semiquinone (25Murthy Y.V.S.N. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8975-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Only about 12% of the semiquinone is stabilized, because this species has an extinction increase relative to oxidized 8-CN-FAD of 26,600m−1 cm−1 (25Murthy Y.V.S.N. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8975-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is evident from the spectra in Fig. 1 A that at the stage of maximal semiquinone formation there is no reduction of 2Fe/2S centers, because there is no change in the spectrum at wavelengths greater than 520 nm. The FAD/FADH° potential is therefore much higher than that of the 2Fe/2S centers. Identical results are obtained by photo-reduction. Extinction changes for this reduction are given in TableI.Table IExtinction changes of artificial FAD-substituted enzymesEnzymeΔɛ2Fe/2S (at 2Fe/2S λ)aAbsorbance contributions from the two 2Fe/2S centers are approximately equal (38); therefore, Δɛ2Fe/S(I) = Δɛ2Fe/S(II) = above values.ΔɛFAD-FADH2 (at 2Fe/2S λ)ΔɛFAD-FADH° (at 2Fe/2S λ)Δɛ2Fe/2S (at FAD λ)aAbsorbance contributions from the two 2Fe/2S centers are approximately equal (38); therefore, Δɛ2Fe/S(I) = Δɛ2Fe/S(II) = above values.ΔɛFAD-FADH2 (at FAD λ)ΔɛFAD-FADH° (at FAD λ)XO3,400 (550)0 (550)−5,500 (550)7,000 (450)12,200 (450)9,760 (450)8-CN-XO3,400 (550)−1,040 (550)−1,870 (550)7,000 (450)7,000 (450)960 (450)1-deaza-XO7,750 (470)2,510 (470)1,360 (470)3,400 (550)6,860 (550)7,330 (550)XDH3,400 (550)0 (550)−5,500 (550)7,000 (450)12,200 (450)9,760 (450)8-CN-XDH3,400 (550)−1,040 (550)−2,300 (550)7,000 (450)7,000 (450)4,050 (450)1-deaza-XDH7,750 (470)2,510 (470)1,360 (470)3,400 (550)6,860 (550)7,330 (550)Extinction coefficients are given in units ofm−1 cm−1 along with the wavelength in nm at which they were measured.

The amounts of oxidized and reduced indigotrisulfonate and the amounts of oxidized and reduced enzyme-bound 8-CN-FAD were estimated as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” The log(ox/red) for the indigotrisulfonate was plottedversus the log(ox/red) for the flavin (Fig. 2,inset). An initial slope of 2 corresponds to the small amount of observed semiquinone formation, which is followed by a slope of 0.9 as compared with a theoretical slope of 1 for the 2-electron reduction of the flavin. The plot gives a potential of −90 mV for the 2-electron reduction of the enzyme-bound 8-CN-FAD. This figure represents a decrease in the potential of 8-CN-FAD of 40 mV on binding to XO, a figure in reasonable agreement with decreases of 47 mV and 50 mV on the binding of native FAD and 1-deaza-FAD, respectively, to XO (Table II).Table IIRedox potentials and steady-state kinetic parameters of artificial FAD-substituted enzymesEnzymeE m, free FADE m, enzyme-boundElectron acceptork catK m, xanthineK m, oxygenK m, NADmVmVs−1μmμmμmXO−208−255 (22)Oxygen (32)13 ± 0.42 ± 0.553 ± 2NAD0.11 ± 0.011 ± 0.66.9 ± 0.68-CN-XO−50 (25)−90 ± 4Oxygen12 ± 21.9 ± 1.0250 ± 120NAD0.018 ± 0.0034.4 ± 0.81.7 ± 0.31-deaza-XO−280 (23)−325 ± 10Oxygen2.0 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.320 ± 6NAD0.049 ± 0.0123.7 ± 0.95.6 ± 1.4XDH−208−340 (20)Oxygen (9)2.1 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.465 ± 9NAD (18)6.3≤178-CN-XDH−50 (25)−158 ± 11Oxygen5.1 ± 0.52.2 ± 0.4540 ± 110NAD0NDaND, not determined.ND1-deaza-XDH−280 (23)−360 ± 14Oxygen0.86 ± 0.041.3 ± 0.483 ± 4NAD2.5 ± 0.1≤111 ± 1a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Spectra from the dithionite reduction of 14 μm 8-CN-XDH are shown in Fig. 1 B. The most notable difference with respect to the reduction of 8-CN-XO is that the semiquinone formed is the neutral semiquinone, as seen by the extinction increases from 550 to 650 nm (25Murthy Y.V.S.N.

A 24-h exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulated PLD-1, but not PLD-2, mRNA expression. This 1,25(OH)2D3-enhanced expression was accompanied by increased total PLD and PLD-1 activity.

Expression of the early (spinous) differentiation marker keratin 1 decreased in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 over 12–24 h. Treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 enhanced the activity of transglutaminase, a late (granular) differentiation marker, by 12 h with a maximal increase after 24 h.

Our results suggest a role for PLD expression/activity during keratinocyte differentiation. The skin is a dynamic organ consisting of the dermis and epidermis, with the latter continuously undergoing regeneration to replace cells lost through normal exposure to the environment. The epidermis is composed of several cell layers. The deepest layer, located at the dermal-epidermal junction, is the basal layer, consisting of the undifferentiated basal keratinocytes, which continuously proliferate. As the cells migrate up through the epidermis, keratinocytes undergo a distinct pattern of differentiation that is essential for the function of the skin as a protective barrier. This pattern is characterized by growth arrest and expression of the mature cytokeratins 1 and 10 in the first differentiated layer of the epidermis, the spinous layer. Early differentiation in the spinous layer is followed by late differentiation in the granular layer accompanied by expression of proteins, including the enzyme transglutaminase, that are essential for the formation of the cornified envelope and corneocytes. The corneocytes are terminally differentiated and constitute the outer layer of the epidermis, the cornified layer, which gives skin its resistance to mechanical stresses (for reviews, see Refs. 1Bikle D.D.

A physiologic role for 1,25(OH)2D3 in regulating keratinocyte differentiation in the epidermis in vivo is suggested by several lines of evidence: 1) keratinocytes express the 1α-hydroxylase, which converts the inactive 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to its active 1,25-dihydroxymetabolite (reviewed in Ref.1Bikle D.D. Pillai S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 3-19PubMed Google Scholar); 2) receptors for 1,25(OH)2D3 are present in the skin and in epidermal keratinocytes (references cited in Ref. 4Bollag W.B. Ducote J. Harmon C.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); and 3) 1,25(OH)2D3 triggers two major events in keratinocytes in vitro: inhibition of proliferation and induction of differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 1Bikle D.D. Pillai S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 3-19PubMed Google Scholar). 25(OH)2D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 sn-1,2-diacylglycerol phosphatidic acid protein kinase C phospholipase D ADP-ribosylation factor guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate cytokeratin K1 II3(NeuAc)2, IV3(NeuAc)2-GgOseCer The mechanism by which 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits proliferation and stimulates differentiation is still unclear. This hormone is thought to function through the vitamin D receptor, a transcription factor affecting expression of genes possessing vitamin D response elements. However, the keratin 1 gene is the only keratinocyte differentiation marker known to possess a 1,25(OH)2D3 response element (5Bikle D.D. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1709S-1714SPubMed Google Scholar, 6Blumenberg M. Connolly D.M. Freedberg I.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 42S-49SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the expression of this marker is inhibited by 1,25(OH)2D3 (7Lu B. Rothnagel J.A. Longley M.A. Tsai S.Y. Roop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7443-7449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 was recently shown to enhance the expression of several phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C isoenzymes (8Pillai S. Bikle D.D. Su M.-J. Ratnam A. Abe J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the activity of which generates diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG, in turn, is known to regulate the activity of protein kinase C (PKC), and numerous data suggest the involvement of PKC in the regulation of keratinocyte growth and differentiation (reviewed in Refs. 1Bikle D.D. Pillai S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 3-19PubMed Google Scholar and 9Inohara S. Exp. Dermatol. 1992; 1: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although PKC-activating DAG can be generated directly by phosphoinositide turnover via phospholipase C, such DAG can also be generated indirectly by an additional pathway. Diacylglycerol is generated by the combination of phospholipase D (PLD), which hydrolyzes phospholipids to generate phosphatidic acid (PA), and PA phosphohydrolase, which dephosphorylates PA to yield DAG (reviewed in Ref. 10Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Indeed, in several cell systems, PLD activity has been shown to underlie at least a portion of agonist-induced sustained DAG production (reviewed in Ref. 10Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that chronic elevations in DAG content are the product of the combined activities of PLD and PA phosphohydrolase (11Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support a role for PLD in differentiation of keratinocytes. For example, the tetrasialo ganglioside GQ1binduces PLD activation, a sustained elevation in DAG content, and induction of keratinocyte differentiation (12Seishima M. Aoyama Y. Mori S. Nozawa Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 835-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 13Yada Y. Okano Y. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Studies in our laboratory also provide evidence for an involvement of PLD in keratinocyte growth inhibition and differentiation. Specifically, incubation of epidermal keratinocytes with bacterial PLD results in inhibition of proliferation and an increase in the activity of a marker of differentiation, transglutaminase (14Jung E.M. Griner R.D. Mann-Blakeney R. Bollag W.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 318-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, staurosporine and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate elicit sustained PLD activation and also induce transglutaminase activity in primary mouse keratinocytes. 2E. M. Jung, S. Betancourt-Calle, R. D. Griner, R. Mann-Blakeney, and W. B. Bollag,Carcinogenesis, in press. Finally, previous findings with two microbial toxins, epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor derived from Staphylococcus aureusE-1 and exoenzyme C3 from Clostridium botulinum, also support an involvement of PLD in keratinocyte differentiation. These toxins inhibit the differentiation of human epidermal keratinocytes through a common mechanism (15Sugai M. Hashimoto K. Kikuchi A. Inoue S. Okumura H. Matsumoto K. Goto Y. Moriishi K. Syuto B. Yoshikawa K. Suginaka H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2600-2604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) involving ADP-ribosylation of small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family. Since RhoA regulates PLD (reviewed in Ref. 16Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 945-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and since in other systems C3 exoenzyme is known to block PLD activation (17Kuribara H. Tago K. Yokozeki T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25667-25671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it is possible that the ability of epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor and C3 to inhibit keratinocyte differentiation may be through their inhibition of the activity of PLD. Two isoforms of PLD, PLD-1 and PLD-2, have recently been cloned, sequenced, and characterized (18Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol.

Both isoenzymes utilize phosphatidylcholine as a substrate and require phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate as a cofactor (19Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J.

Interestingly, two recent reports have observed changes in the expression and/or activity of PLD-1 associated with differentiation of C6 glioma (23Yoshimura S. Nakashima S. Ohguchi K. Sakai H.

Furthermore, PLD-1 appears to represent the isoform sensitive to microbial toxin inhibition, since this isoenzyme is regulated by small GTP-binding proteins, such as Rho. On the other hand, PLD-2 exhibits constitutive activity (22Colley W. Sung T.-C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), and its function is unknown (19Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J.

Because 1,25(OH)2D3 increases the expression of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase, which generates PKC-activating DAG, and because PLD not only generates DAG but also may be an important signaling enzyme during keratinocyte differentiation, we hypothesized that 1,25(OH)2D3 may also exert its effects on keratinocyte differentiation by modulating PLD expression and/or activity. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on PLD-1 and -2 expression and PLD activity. We report that 1,25(OH)2D3 induces PLD-1, but not PLD-2, expression. The current work establishes the time course of the induction of PLD-1 expression in primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 and demonstrates a concomitant enhancement of PLD activity. Furthermore, the data correlate the activation of this signaling pathway with the induction and progression of keratinocyte differentiation.

Cell Res. 1974; 86: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) were used to initiate primary cultures. Cells were plated at a density of 25,000 cells/cm2 and were allowed to attach overnight in the presence of keratinocyte plating medium composed of calcium-free minimal essential medium supplemented with 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 μm calcium chloride, 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 2 mm glutamine, ITS+, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml fungizone. Following attachment, the cells were refed with keratinocyte growth medium composed of the above medium in which serum was deleted and 90 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract was added. Near confluent cultures of primary keratinocytes were refed with keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with 250 nm1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle control. After the indicated time periods, the cells were lysed with 1.0 ml of TriZOL reagent, and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (15 μg) was separated on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to GeneScreen (NEN Life Science Products) membrane. Following prehybridization overnight, the blots were probed overnight in Church-Gilbert buffer (0.5 msodium phosphate, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6) at 65 °C with a random hexamer-primed [32P]dCTP-labeled probe fragment. Blots were then washed four times for 5 min each at room temperature in 2× SSC plus 0.1% SDS and two times for 30 min each at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS (1× SSC: 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and exposed to film for 6–10 days. Quantitation was performed using a Bio-Rad model GS-700 imaging densitometer, and the density of each band was normalized to the density of the corresponding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase band.

The probe for cytokeratin K1 was kindly provided by Dr. Stuart Yuspa (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Total PLD activity was assayed as detailed in Ref. 26Bollag W.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 105: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar and is described briefly. To determine an acute effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on PLD activity, near confluent cultures of primary keratinocytes (densities of 15,000–30,000 cells/cm2) were labeled for 20–24 h with [3H]oleic acid and then refed with keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with 250 nm1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle control in the presence of 0.5% ethanol for an additional 30 min. To determine a chronic effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on PLD activity, keratinocytes were incubated for 24 h with 250 nm1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle control prior to the addition of approximately 5 μCi/sample of [14C]ethanol in ethanol (final concentration = 0.5%) for an additional 1 h. The incubations were terminated by aspirating the medium and lysing the cells by the addition of 0.2% SDS containing 5 mmEDTA. The radiolabeled phosphatidylethanol was then extracted into chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), separated by thin layer chromatography, visualized with autofluorography using En3Hance, and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Rho- and ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-stimulatable PLD-1 activity was assayedin vitro essentially as in Ref. 27Iwasaki-Bessho Y. Banno Y. Yoshimura S. Ito Y. Kitajima Y. Nozawa Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 376-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Near confluent epidermal keratinocytes were treated for 24 h with control vehicle (0.05% ethanol) or 250 nm 1,25(OH)2D3. Cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped from the plate in 300 μl of buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2.1 μmleupeptin, 1.8 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A with or without 2.5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor and 1 μg/ml chymostatin)). Keratinocytes were then homogenized using a pellet pestle (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) and centrifuged to remove unlysed cells. The resulting supernatant (40 μl) was assayed in vitro for PLD activity in the presence and absence of 1 μm each of GTPγS-loaded Rho and ARF in a final volume of 150 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm EGTA, 80 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2. The substrate consisted of phospholipid vesicles composed of 320 μg of phosphatidylethanolamine, 20 μg of phosphatidylcholine, 14 μg of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and 50 μCi of [choline-methyl-3H]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and prepared by sonication in 2.5 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the phospholipid vesicle mixture (1.3 μCi/sample) and proceeded for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking. Reactions were terminated, and unreacted [3H]phosphatidylcholine was precipitated by the addition of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid and bovine serum albumin. Samples were centrifuged at 4 °C, and [3H]choline released into the supernatant was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Blanks to which no cell lysate was added were performed, and the determined radioactivity was subtracted from all samples. Values were then expressed as the difference between PLD activity assayed in the presence of Rho and ARF versus in the absence of these two small GTP-binding proteins. Controls in which human PLD-1- or mouse PLD-2-overexpressing (baculovirus-infected) Sf9 membranes were assayed as above showed that PLD-1 activity was stimulated in the presence of Rho and ARF, whereas PLD-2 activity was unaffected (and/or slightly inhibited), as previously reported (22Colley W. Sung T.-C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant, baculovirus-expressed human Rho and ARF and PLD-overexpressing insect cell membranes were generous gifts of Dr. Nancy Pryer (Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Richmond, CA). Near confluent cultures of primary keratinocytes were refed with keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with the indicated concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle control. After the indicated time periods, the cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for approximately 1 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and reactions were terminated using ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. Cells were washed sequentially with 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by deionized water and were solubilized in 0.3 m NaOH. An aliquot of this NaOH extract was counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Near confluent cultures of primary keratinocytes were refed with keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with 250 nm1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle control. Cells were harvested, and transglutaminase activity was measured according to the method of Folk and Chung (28Folk J.E. Chung S.I. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 358-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Specifically, dimethylcasein was substituted for α-casein, and reactions were permitted to continue overnight before isolating the [3H]putrescine dimethylcasein product on filters with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The radiolabeled product was then counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer and normalized to protein content of the samples as determined using the micro-BCA protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The expression of PLD-1 mRNA in neonatal mouse skin was detected by in situ hybridization as described by Wilkinson (29Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 75-84Google Scholar), with modifications for use with tissue sections. Briefly, neonatal mouse skins were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Fixed skins were then dehydrated in ethanol and xylene and embedded in paraffin. Seven-μm-thick sections were cut, deparaffinated, and rehydrated. The sections were treated with proteinase K and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde prior to hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled PLD-1 probe (nucleotides 542–1390, as above) at 70 °C overnight in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1% SDS, 5 mg/ml heparin, and 50 mg/ml yeast tRNA. Following hybridization, the tissue sections were washed sequentially in 2× SSC plus 1% SDS, 1× SSC plus 1% SDS, and 0.5× SSC plus 1% SDS for 1 h each at 70 °C. The sections were then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody for 2 h and washed in TBST overnight. The colorimetric reaction for alkaline phosphatase was performed using nitro blue tetrazolium and X-phosphate. The data are presented as means ± S.E. Each keratinocyte preparation represents a separate experiment (n = 1). Data were analyzed using analysis of variance or Student's t test, as appropriate, to determine if individual time points or treatments differed significantly from control. The level of significance was p < 0.05. To determine the ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to modulate the expression of PLD, Northern blot analysis was performed. Near confluent cultures of primary mouse keratinocytes were treated with 250 nm1,25(OH)2D3 (a maximal growth-inhibitory concentration, as shown in Fig. 4 A) or vehicle for 24 h, and total RNA was isolated. RNA was analyzed by Northern hybridization with probes for PLD-1 and PLD-2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PLD-1 mRNA levels were specifically increased by 250 nm 1,25(OH)2D3, while PLD-2 levels were unchanged (Fig.1). Subsequently, treatment of near confluent cultures of primary mouse keratinocytes with 250 nm 1,25(OH)2D3 for various times revealed that PLD-1 expression increased to 167% of control within 8 h and reached a peak increase of 289% of control at 24 h (Fig. 2).Figure 1Effect of 1,25(OH)2D3on the expression of PLD-1 and -2 in primary cultures of mouse keratinocytes. Near confluent cultures of primary mouse keratinocytes were treated with 250 nm1,25(OH)2D3 (D 3) or vehicle control (C) for 24 h, and Northern blot analysis was performed.

Near confluent cultures of primary mouse keratinocytes were treated with 250 nm1,25(OH)2D3 (D 3) or vehicle control (C) for the indicated time periods, and Northern blot analysis was performed. Two bands are typically recognized by the PLD-1 probe; the size differential of these two bands (the upper band is 7.5 kilobase pairs, and the lower band is 5 kilobase pairs) suggests that they cannot represent the two splice variants of PLD-1 described previously, PLD1a and PLD1b, which differ by only 114 base pairs (20Colley W.C.

Although the precise identities of the two bands are unclear, the lower band was used for quantitation, since the 5-kilobase pair size matches that defined as the cDNA coding region (20Colley W.C. Altshuller Y.M. Sue-Ling C.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Bollag R.J. Bollag W.B. Frohman M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The density of the PLD-1 band was normalized to the density of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) band within each lane, and the level of PLD-1 expression by treated keratinocytes is expressed as a percentage of the control PLD-1 expression for each time point. The compiled results of multiple experiments are expressed graphically, and one representative blot containing a range of time points is shown. Asterisks indicate that PLD-1 expression by treated keratinocytes is significantly greater than the control PLD-1 expression at the given time point (means ± S.E.,n = 3–5, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To establish that the increase in PLD-1 mRNA levels resulted in increased enzyme activity, total PLD activity was measured in near confluent cultures of primary mouse keratinocytes following both acute (30-min) and chronic (24-h) exposures to 250 nm1,25(OH)2D3. After 30 min, there was no significant effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on PLD activity (Fig. 3 A). However, after 24 h the PLD activity was increased to 140% of control (Fig. 3 A). Thus, 1,25(OH)2D3increased both PLD-1 expression and PLD activity within 24 h in primary cultures of mouse keratinocytes. Previous reports indicate that PLD-1 activity is enhanced by the small GTP-binding proteins, Rho and ARF (reviewed in Ref. 16Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Curr.

We observed an approximate 3-fold increase in Rho- and ARF-stimulated activity in 1,25(OH)2D3-pretreated cell homogenates (Fig.3 B), consistent with our observations of an approximate 3-fold increase in PLD-1 expression, as well as enhanced total PLD activity, in response to 1,25(OH)2D3.

The folding process for oligomeric proteins is more complex as the acquisition of the quaternary structure entails both, the intramolecular refolding of the individual polypeptide chains and the simultaneous intermolecular interactions between the various subunits. Hence, elucidation of the hierarchy of events occurring during the denaturation of an oligomeric protein provides important means to delineate such a process.Legume lectins, a class of highly homologous, carbohydrate-binding proteins exhibit the same jelly roll tertiary structural fold but differ considerably in their ligand specificity and quaternary structures (1Lis H.

They can hence be considered to be “natural mutants” of quaternary structures. However, apart from their agglutinating activity, the role of oligomerization in lectins is not clearly understood (1Lis H. Sharon N. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Unlike most other legume lectins, which dissociate and unfold as single entities (12Surolia A. Sharon N. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol.

Existence of such a molten globule-like structure with retention of binding activity is perhaps unprecedented so far. Moreover, the occurrence of such a species for PNA suggests that the monomers of legume lectins are competent to bind sugars and oligomerization appears to impart them stability and necessary spatial disposition of sugar binding sites for manifestation of their respective biologic activities.DISCUSSIONThe unfolding process of peanut agglutinin studied by GdnHCl-induced denaturation was found to be completely reversible. The profiles were biphasic in nature when monitored by all the three spectroscopic probes, suggesting a non-two-state unfolding process. The intermediate in the unfolding of PNA was further characterized spectroscopically (fluorescence, near- and far-UV-CD), by gel filtration and by titration calorimetry, to determine the extent of its activity. The intermediate has about 80% of its secondary structural elements intact, yet has considerably decreased tertiary structure (nearly 70% loss of tertiary structure). It seems to be fairly compact in nature (its gel filtration elution volume corresponds to that of the monomer of PNA), and yet highly solvent exposed, as observed by its strong ability to bind ANS. This species may hence be described as a molten globule-like intermediate, as similar properties have been observed for the molten globule states of a number of proteins. For example, in the case acid isolated molten globule of α-lactalbumin, there is nearly a 75% loss of tertiary structure, while the secondary structure is almost intact in addition to being highly compact in nature. Likewise, in cytochrome c this state is accompanied by a loss of approximately 23–30% of the secondary structure (20Kim B.L. Baldwin R.L. Annu. Rev.

Yet, unusually, the PNA intermediate, despite the reduced tertiary structure, retains its carbohydrate binding activity to a considerable degree. It thus seems that, at least for PNA, the architecture of the binding site in the intermediate seems sufficiently intact, necessary for its ligand recognition. These data, hence, not only provide information on the folding pathway of peanut agglutinin tetramer, which may be correlated with its three-dimensional structure, but also provide novel insights on the architecture of a functional monomer of a legume lectin. It is thus pertinent, at this point, to describe briefly the unusual features of its quaternary structure. Unlike any other legume lectin, PNA is best described as a dimer of two back to back dimers each 2-fold symmetric (10Banerjee R. Mande S.C. Ganesh V. Das K. Dhanaraj V. Mahanta S.K. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1994; 91: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Banerjee R. Das K. Ravishankar R. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although the two dimers, viz. subunits 1 and 4 and 2 and 3 in the tetramer, are also related by a dyad, the different dyads neither intersect nor are they mutually perpendicular. Consequently, the molecule has an open quaternary arrangement. The interactions between the two dimers involve two distinct kinds of interfaces. One is a side by side antiparallel alignment of the flat six-stranded back β-sheets, between subunits 1 and 2, like the highly extended “canonical” dimeric interface in legume lectins such as concanavalin A (ConA), pea lectins, etc. However, the two sheets at this interface do not come close enough as in ConA, pea lectin, etc. Instead the association between the two back β-sheets from subunits 1 and 2 are stabilized by six water bridges. The other interface, viz. between subunits 3 and 4, an incidental consequence of the presence of the two back to back (1-4 and 2-3) and a side by side (1-2) interfaces, has not been observed in any other tetrameric protein so far. The back to back association between the two flat back β-sheets across the subunits 1-4 and subunits 2-3 of PNA tetramer appears to be intrinsically less stable as compared with the canonical dimeric interfaces of the legume lectins. The 1-2 interface in peanut agglutinin, which is common to 1-4 and 2-3 dimers, does not link up to give a contiguous 12-strand sheet, as it does so in ConA, pea lectins, etc., hence it is unable to confer stability to the extent observed in the latter class of lectins and with a slight chaotrope perturbation, dissociates into monomers readily. The resultant exposure of the flat six-stranded back β-sheet may lead to the display of extensive hydrophobic patches that is recognized by ANS, although the exposure of a recently described additional hydrophobic region in PNA is not ruled out altogether (11Banerjee R. Das K. Ravishankar R. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This monomeric state has considerably reduced tertiary structure and yet binds the ligand, indicating that the regions of the two sheets supporting the four carbohydrate binding loops as well as the loops themselves retain the geometric features of the combining site like that in the native protein.Legume lectins exist as oligomers, the nature of which has important functional implications (1Lis H. Sharon N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 741-749Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 2Goldstein I.J. Hayes C.E. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4933-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), for example, have shown that various lectins form well defined and characteristic lattices when complexed with multivalent oligosaccharides that may underlie their effects on cells such as mitogenesis. From our studies, it appears that lectin monomers may have all the necessary features compatible with carbohydrate binding and that oligomerization essentially appears to endow them with additional stability and the requisite topology of binding sites for manifesting their biologic activity. Despite their preponderance in biologic systems, studies on the folding pathways of oligomeric proteins are less common and information regarding the same, meager.

The back to back association between the two flat back β-sheets across the subunits 1-4 and subunits 2-3 of PNA tetramer appears to be intrinsically less stable as compared with the canonical dimeric interfaces of the legume lectins. The 1-2 interface in peanut agglutinin, which is common to 1-4 and 2-3 dimers, does not link up to give a contiguous 12-strand sheet, as it does so in ConA, pea lectins, etc., hence it is unable to confer stability to the extent observed in the latter class of lectins and with a slight chaotrope perturbation, dissociates into monomers readily. The resultant exposure of the flat six-stranded back β-sheet may lead to the display of extensive hydrophobic patches that is recognized by ANS, although the exposure of a recently described additional hydrophobic region in PNA is not ruled out altogether (11Banerjee R. Das K. Ravishankar R. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This monomeric state has considerably reduced tertiary structure and yet binds the ligand, indicating that the regions of the two sheets supporting the four carbohydrate binding loops as well as the loops themselves retain the geometric features of the combining site like that in the native protein. Legume lectins exist as oligomers, the nature of which has important functional implications (1Lis H. Sharon N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 741-749Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 2Goldstein I.J. Hayes C.E. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1978; 35: 127-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar).

From our studies, it appears that lectin monomers may have all the necessary features compatible with carbohydrate binding and that oligomerization essentially appears to endow them with additional stability and the requisite topology of binding sites for manifesting their biologic activity."

In this report we have used in vitro insertion assays to analyze four additional members of the chlorophyll-a/b-binding protein family. We show that two members, Lhca1 and Lhcb5, display an absolute requirement for stroma, nucleoside triphosphates, and protein transport apparatus, indicating an “assisted” pathway that probably resembles that of LHCP.

The insertion of membrane proteins is a complex process in which two major obstacles must be overcome: the transfer of hydrophobic regions into the bilayer with the correct final topology and the efficient translocation of hydrophilic domains to the transside of the bilayer. Many such proteins are believed to insert post-translationally into bacterial, mitochondrial, and chloroplast membranes, and a variety of in vivo and in vitroapproaches have been used to study the underlying mechanisms. In several cases it has been shown that the proteins follow an “assisted” pathway that involves protein transport machinery in both the soluble phase and the target membrane. Escherichia coli has been a popular model system, and a range of membrane proteins has been shown to rely on the cytosolic signal recognition particle (SRP), 1The abbreviations SRPsignal recognition particleLHCPmajor light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein of photosystem IINTPnucleoside triphosphateCABchlorophyll a/b-binding proteinElipearly light-inducible proteinPsbSphotosystem II subunit STricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineDPdegradation productpPsbSprecursor of PsbSpLHCPprecursor of LHCP which is a complex of 4.5 S RNA molecule and Ffh protein, a homolog of the 54-kDa component of eukaryotic SRPs that target proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (1De Gier J.-W.L.

It is generally believed that this factor docks with the SecYEG translocon in the inner membrane, and this has been confirmed recently for at least one SRP substrate (6Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A.

InE. coli, two single-span proteins, the coat proteins of the M13 and pf3 phages, have been shown to insert into the inner membrane without the aid of SRP, SecA, or the membrane-bound Sec apparatus (10Kuhn A. FEMS Micro. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,11Kiefer D. Xintong H. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These proteins may thus insert spontaneously into the bilayer. A similar mechanism may apply to other bacterial inner membrane proteins, but none has been characterized in vitro, and the in vivo analyses have tended to offer a less direct mode of analysis. The chloroplast thylakoid membrane has also been employed as a model system for the study of membrane protein biogenesis, in part because the component photosynthetic proteins have been characterized intensively and partly because the membrane itself has been shown to insert or import a wide range of proteins in vitro (for review see Ref. 12Robinson C. Hynds P.J. Robinson D. Mant A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 209-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may reflect the relative ease with which these membranes can be isolated in a purified form. The chloroplast is prokaryotic-like in many respects, having probably evolved from an endosymbiotic cyanobacterium, and it contains a Sec system for the transport of proteins into the lumen (13Yuan J. Henry R. McCaffery M. Cline K. Science. 1994; 266: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 14Nakai M. Goto A. Nohara T. Sugita D. Endo T. J. Biol.

Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22175-22180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). As with bacteria, two distinct pathways have been identified for the insertion of membrane proteins, one of which is assisted, and the other of which is SRP/Sec/ΔpH-independent. One imported multispanning membrane protein, the major light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein of photosystem II (Lhcb1, but usually termed LHCII or LHCP) has been shown to require SRP together with GTP for insertion into the membrane (17Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and proteolysis of thylakoids blocks this insertion process (18Fulson D.R. Cline K. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) indicating the involvement of protein-targeting apparatus (probably the Sec apparatus, but this remains to be confirmed). In broad terms this targeting pathway therefore resembles the bacterial SRP-dependent pathway for membrane proteins, but significant mechanistic differences may exist because no RNA molecule has been identified in stromal SRP, and the SRP54 subunit instead forms a complex with a novel 43-kDa subunit (20Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A very different SRP/Sec-independent pathway has been identified for a subset of thylakoid membrane proteins: CF0II and the X and W subunits of photosystem II (PsbX, PsbW). Each of the mature proteins contains a single transmembrane span, and each is synthesized in the cytosol with a bipartite presequence in which a typical “envelope transit” signal is followed by a cleavable signal peptide. These proteins insert into thylakoids in the absence of SRP, SecA, nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) or a ΔpH (21Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Lorkovic Z.J. Schröder W.P. Pakrasi H.B. Irrgang K.-D. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and there is strong evidence that the Sec apparatus is likewise not involved: proteolysis of thylakoids abolishes Sec-dependent transport of lumenal proteins yet has no effect on the insertion of these membrane proteins (19Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these proteins may insert spontaneously into the membrane, and the signal peptides probably serve an unusual function by simply providing an additional hydrophobic region that assists insertion through the formation of a loop intermediate (24Thompson S.J. Kim S.J. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18979-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this respect the insertion of these proteins may resemble that of M13 coat protein, which is the only other membrane protein known to be synthesized with a signal peptide but inserted by a Sec-independent process (10Kuhn A. FEMS Micro. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, Sec/SRP-independent insertion processes have only been characterized for simple single-span membrane proteins, and the SRP-dependent process has been characterized only for LHCP. In this study we have analyzed the insertion of four additional members of the extended light-harvesting chlorophylla/b-binding protein (CAB) family. We show that two members resemble LHCP in that stromal factors, NTPs, and protein transport machinery are all absolutely essential for integration. In contrast, two other members, early light-inducible protein 2 (Elip2) and photosystem II subunit S (PsbS), can insert efficiently in the complete absence of these factors, suggesting a possible spontaneous insertion mechanism. A portion of the population of Elip2 and PsbS molecules does, however, appear to utilize the assisted pathway described above, indicating that some thylakoid proteins are capable of following parallel insertion pathways. EST cDNA clones encoding Arabidopsis CAB proteins were obtained from theArabidopsis stock center at Ohio State University. Full-length cDNAs were characterized, and both strands of each cDNA were fully sequenced; the full sequence details of these clones together with those encoding other CAB proteins will appear elsewhere. 2S. Jansson, manuscript in preparation. The stock numbers for the clones are 93I7T7, 37A1T7, VCVCD09, and 137M5T7 for cDNAs encoding Lhca1, Lhcb5, Elip2, and PsbS, respectively. The precursor proteins were prepared in vitro by transcription of the cDNAs using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase followed by translation in a wheat germ lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. Other precursors were synthesized as detailed in Ref. 19Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, and a cDNA encoding petunia pLHCP was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Viitanen. Apyrase (grade VI, potato), nigericin, proteinase K, thermolysin, trypsin (type XIII, bovine pancreas), and trypsin inhibitor (type I-S, soybean) were all obtained from Sigma. Pea seeds (Pisum sativum var. Kelvedon Wonder) were obtained from Nickerson-Zwaan. Isolated thylakoid membranes were prepared from intact pea chloroplasts, as described in Ref. 25Brock I.W. Hazell L. Michl D. Nielsen V.S. Møller B.L. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. Thylakoid membranes were washed twice with ice-cold 10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 8.0, and 5 mm MgCl2 (HM) and were then resuspended in HM or stromal extract to a concentration of 0.5 mg ml−1 chlorophyll. Stromal extract was prepared by lysing intact chloroplasts in HM at 1.0 mg ml−1 chlorophyll. Integration assays (50 μl) contained 20 μg of chlorophyll and 5 μl of in vitro-translated precursor protein mixture (treated with 0.1 mg ml−1 final concentration of puromycin). Where appropriate, the thylakoids and translation mixture were preincubated on ice in the presence of inhibitors. Apyrase was used to deplete the assay of NTPs as detailed in Hulford et al. (26Hulford A. Hazell L. Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3251-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed in an illuminated water bath (intensity 150 μmol photons m−2 s−1, 26 °C) for 20 min and were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold HM followed by reisolation of the thylakoid membranes for direct analysis, treatment by protease, or urea extraction. All samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Insertion efficiencies were quantitated by measurement of the protease-resistant degradation product using a PhosphorImager and are shown quantitated as the percentage of available precursor in the insertion reaction. The technique was adapted from Breytonet al. (27Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes (equivalent to 10 or 20 μg of chlorophyll) were washed in 1 ml of 20 mmTricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant carefully removed. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of freshly made 6.8 m urea and 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, and incubated for 10 min on the bench (22–24 °C). The sample was then subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles (solid CO2/room temperature) before being centrifuged at 50,000 rpm (135,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL100 benchtop ultracentrifuge, using the TLA100.3 rotor. The first 80-μl supernatant was withdrawn carefully to avoid contamination with the pellet, and the remaining supernatant was discarded (this inevitably resulted in the loss of a very small quantity of the pellet). The pellet was resuspended once more in 100 μl of 6.8 m urea and 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, and the extraction process was repeated. Equivalent amounts of the first supernatant and the second pellet were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The second round of extraction rarely resulted in the removal of any extra material from the thylakoid membranes. The protocol was as described in Ref. 19Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, with the following modifications. After activation of the chloroplast ATPase by illuminating intact chloroplasts in the presence of dithiothreitol and Ca2+, isolated thylakoids in HM were incubated with or without 60 μg ml−1 trypsin for 10 min on ice. Both samples were washed with HM buffer containing 120 μg ml−1 trypsin inhibitor, and the membranes were reisolated by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm (135,000 × g) for 6 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge, using the TLA100.3 rotor. The thylakoids were washed twice further with HM and 60 μg ml−1 trypsin inhibitor and similarly reisolated before being resuspended in stromal extract (from chloroplasts lysed at 1.0 mg ml−1 chlorophyll) or HM buffer. Each assay contained (in 50 μl) thylakoids equivalent to 20 μg of chlorophyll in stromal extract or HM, 60 μg ml−1 trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm MgATP, and 10 μl of puromycin-treated in vitro translation mixture (which also contains ATP at 1.2 mm). The assay was set up in a darkroom under a green safelight, and the incubation was carried out for 30 min at 26–27 °C. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold HM followed by centrifugation at 17,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. There were no discernible differences in the recovery of membranes between trypsin-treated and control samples. One half of each sample was analyzed directly, the other half by thermolysin treatment (0.2 mg ml−1 thermolysin, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 40 min on ice). Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. CAB proteins form a diverse family of pigment-binding proteins that apparently originated through internal gene duplication from an ancestral single-span protein (for review, see Ref. 28Green B.R. Pichersky E. Kloppstech K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 181-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Most plant CAB proteins have three transmembrane spans, and the structure of the most abundant member (LHCP) has been solved by electron crystallography (29Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). In this report we have studied the insertion of four Arabidopsis thaliana CAB proteins; these are the Lhca1 protein (Lhca corresponds to the light-harvesting complex of photosystem I), Lhcb5 (Lhcb = light-harvesting complex of photosystem II), PsbS, and Elip2. Elips are early light-inducible proteins that appear very rapidly after the onset of illumination and then decline rapidly in abundance. Their function is unclear, but roles in transient binding of chlorophyll molecules or in energy dissipation have both been suggested (28Green B.R. Pichersky E. Kloppstech K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 181-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). All of the proteins exhibit diagnostic conserved transmembrane regions (the first and third regions in the Lhca1, Lhcb5, and Elip2 sequences (28Green B.R. Pichersky E. Kloppstech K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 181-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar)). PsbS is an unusual component of the photosystem II core complex which is believed to contain four transmembrane spans (30Wedel N. Klein R. Ljungberg U. Andersson B. Herrmann R.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Funk C. Schröder W.P. Napiwotzki A. Tjus S.E. Renger G. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11133-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The full sequence details will be presented elsewhere.2 In this study we used assays for the insertion of proteins into isolated thylakoids, and as criteria for correct insertion we used protease protection assays and urea washing of the membranes. To characterize the protease resistance of the authentic mature proteins we used thylakoids containing radiolabeled mature protein that had been imported into intact chloroplasts. Once inside the organelles, many membrane proteins have been found to insert efficiently and correctly into the thylakoid membrane, and incorrect insertion has not been documented to date. Fig. 1 shows chloroplast import assays using the precursors of Lhca1 and Lhcb5. The precursors are imported and sorted efficiently to the thylakoids (lanes T); incubation of these membranes with thermolysin (lanes T+) reveals that Lhca1 is wholly resistant to digestion, whereas Lhcb5 is clipped to a slightly smaller size. The translation products are quantitatively digested to low molecular mass peptides by the same concentrations of protease (lanes Tr+), confirming that the observed protease resistance of the mature proteins is caused by their transmembrane configurations. Fig. 2 shows assays for the insertion for these two proteins into thylakoids, in which we tested the requirement for added stromal extract or the effects of pretreating the incubations with apyrase. Apyrase hydrolyzes all available NTPs and totally blocks targeting by the SRP- and SecA-dependent pathways, both of which depend entirely on NTPs (26Hulford A. Hazell L. Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3251-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hoffman N.E. Franklin A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Incubation of both pre-Lhca1 and pre-Lhcb5 with thylakoids and stromal extract leads to the generation of mature protein because of the action of stromal-processing peptidase, which removes the envelope transit domain. Under these conditions, a significant portion of the population of mature protein molecules is resistant to further digestion. The appearance of the protease-resistant Lhca1 and Lhcb5 depends almost entirely on the presence of stromal extract and is totally abolished by preincubation with apyrase. These data indicate strongly that the protease-resistant protein represents inserted protein and that insertion requires stromal factors and NTPs. Only one point remains unclear; mature Lhcb5 generated in chloroplast import assays is digested slightly by thermolysin, whereas the same concentration of protease does not digest the inserted protein in thylakoid insertion assays. One possibility is that this difference reflects differing states of assembly of the protein in the two types of assay, but further work will be required to test this. Other tests have confirmed that the protease-resistant Lhca1 and Lhcb5 are indeed inserted into the membrane; the proteins are recovered only in the pellet fraction after extensive urea washes as used below for PsbS and Elip2 (not shown). In general, therefore, Lhca1 and Lhcb5 appear to resemble LHCP in that both stromal factors and NTPs are required for insertion into thylakoids. Future studies should reveal whether the same stromal factors are involved in each case. Our primary aim in this study was to determine whether all of the CAB family members use similar insertion pathways, and PsbS and Elip2 were found to be good test subjects because of their ability to insert efficiently into isolated thylakoids. Again, acquisition of protease resistance was used as a criterion for membrane insertion. Fig. 3 A shows chloroplast imports of pre-Elip2 in the absence or presence of nigericin, a proton ionophore that dissipates the thylakoidal ΔpH. This compound markedly inhibits the insertion of LHCP leading to its appearance in the stroma (32Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no effect is observed on the import characteristics of Elip2, and the protein is found almost entirely in the thylakoid fraction in both panels. Incubation of the thylakoids with 50 μg/ml proteinase K (lanes T+) leads to the appearance of two degradation products (DP1 and DP2). Assays for the import of Elip2 into thylakoids (Fig. 3 B) show that the thylakoid-associated protein is converted to the same two products by proteinase K, and comparison with authentic mature Elip2 from a chloroplast import shows that the DP1:DP2 ratio is identical when generated by even 100 or 150 μg/ml proteinase K. Both concentrations of proteinase K digest the translation product essentially to completion. These data indicate that DP1 and DP2 are diagnostic of correct insertion and that Elip2 has inserted correctly into the isolated thylakoids. Insertion is more efficient in the presence of stromal extract but nevertheless occurs efficiently in the complete absence of stroma. The effects of apyrase and the presence/absence of stromal extract are shown in Fig. 4, and the efficiency of insertion was quantitated by measurement of the [35S]methionine in the degradation products. Insertion efficiencies are calculated on the assumption that the degradation products contain the same number of labeled residues as mature size protein (because the sites of cleavage are not known). The figures given are therefore certain to be underestimates because analysis of the primary sequence shows that methionine residues must be lost when Elip2 is converted to this size of degradation product by cleavage at either the NH2 or COOH terminus (not shown). In the absence of stroma, insertion of Elip2 is again observed as demonstrated by the appearance of DP1 and DP2. The presence of stroma again enhances the insertion efficiency approximately 2-fold, and the presence of apyrase reduces import efficiency to about the same level as observed in the absence of stroma. These data strongly suggest that a proportion of the molecules use an assisted pathway that depends on stromal factors and NTPs, whereas just over half of the inserting molecules do so in the complete absence of stroma/NTPs. The lower panel of Fig. 4is a control to verify the effectiveness of apyrase in this particular experiment. i33K is an intermediate size construct that is imported into the thylakoid lumen by the ATP-dependent Sec system (26Hulford A. Hazell L. Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3251-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the data show that the appearance of protease-protected, mature 33-kDa protein is stimulated by the presence of stromal extract but completely blocked by apyrase treatment. Similar tests were carried out on PsbS. Fig.5 shows a chloroplast import assay in which the precursor protein (pPsbS) is efficiently imported, processed to the mature size, and localized in the thylakoid membrane (lane T). Incubation of the thylakoids with 50 μg/ml proteinase K converts the 24-kDa mature protein to a series of degradation products with masses of between 12 and 15 kDa. The larger product (DP1) becomes less prominent at higher concentrations of proteinase K (100 and 150 μg/ml), but the remaining products (DP2–4) are relatively resistant even to these very high concentrations of protease. The translation product is completely digested by all three concentrations of proteinase K, and labeled digestion products are only observed comigrating with the dye front (df). Incubation of pPsbS with isolated thylakoids in either the presence or absence of stromal extract leads to the appearance of the same four DPs (Fig. 5,lower panel), and the relative intensities of the four bands are essentially identical when thylakoids are digested from chloroplast or thylakoid import assays. This finding represents strong evidence that PsbS is able to insert into thylakoids. Calculation of the insertion efficiency is made more difficult by the presence of only a single methionine in the mature protein (the presequence contains two), hence some degradation products may not be apparent in this type of assay. However, even taking this into account, our experience is that PsbS inserts into thylakoids with relatively high efficiency (e.g. slightly more efficiently than Elip2 or pLHCP). The effects of apyrase are shown in Fig.6. As with Elip2, insertion is stimulated by the presence of stroma, and apyrase reduces this enhanced level of insertion to the figure observed in the absence of stroma. The presence of stromal extract leads to the processing of the precursor protein to the mature size but insertion proceeds in the absence of any apparent processing in the “−stromal extract” incubation, indicating that the full precursor is competent for insertion. The data indicate that, in this experiment, just over half of the PsbS inserts by an assisted mechanism with the remainder able to insert in the absence of NTPs or stromal factors. Although protease resistance is used widely as an indication that membrane insertion has taken place, we sought an alternative criterion, and urea washing has proven to be very useful. B"
https://openalex.org/W1971223670,"Transcription factors are often regulated by associated protein cofactors that are able to modify their activity by several different mechanisms. In this study we show that calreticulin, a Ca2+-binding protein with chaperone activity, binds to thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), a homeodomain-containing protein implicated in the differentiation of lung and thyroid. The interaction between calreticulin and TTF-1 appears to have functional significance because it results in increased transcriptional stimulation of TTF-1-dependent promoters. Calreticulin binds to the TTF-1 homeodomain and promotes its folding, suggesting that the mechanism involved in stimulation of transcriptional activity is an increase of the steady-state concentration of active TTF-1 protein in the cell. We also demonstrate that calreticulin mRNA levels in thyroid cells are under strict control by the thyroid-stimulating hormone, thus implicating calreticulin in the modulation of thyroid gene expression by thyroid-stimulating hormone."
https://openalex.org/W2005847772,"The urokinase receptor overexpressed in invasive cancers promotes laminin degradation. The current study was undertaken to identify cis elements and trans-acting factors activating urokinase receptor expression through a footprinted (−148/−124) region of the promoter containing putative activator protein-2- and Sp1-binding motifs. Mobility shifting experiments using nuclear extract from a high urokinase receptor-expressing cell line (RKO) indicated that Sp1, Sp3, and a factor similar to, but distinct from, activator protein-2α bound to this region. Mutations preventing the binding of the activator protein 2α-related factor diminished urokinase receptor promoter activity. In RKO cells, the expression of a negative regulator of activator protein-2 function diminished urokinase receptor promoter activity, protein, and laminin degradation. Conversely, urokinase receptor promoter activity in low urokinase receptor-expressing GEO cells was increased by activator protein-2αA expression. Although using GEO nuclear extract, little activator protein-2α-related factor bound to the footprinted region, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment, which induces urokinase receptor expression, increased complex formation.

The urokinase-type plasminogen activator (urokinase) is a serine protease that converts the inert zymogen plasminogen into plasmin, a protease with broad substrate specificity leading to extracellular matrix degradation and tumor invasion (1Nielsen L.

Third, the u-PAR interacts with the extracellular domain of integrins to connect to the cytoskeleton, thereby mediating cell adhesion and migration (13Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C.

Fourth, the u-PAR is chemotactic for human monocytes and mast cells, and this may require the cleavage of the binding site between domains 1 and 2 (16Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S.

Mignatti P. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1992; 60: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar,19Casey J.R. Petranka J.G. Kottra J. Fleenor D.E. Rosse W.F. Blood. 1994; 84: 1151-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of the u-PAR gene yields a 1.4-kilobase mRNA or an alternatively spliced variant lacking the membrane attachment peptide sequence (20Roldan A. Cubellis M. Masucci M. Behrendt N. Lund L.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The amounts of u-PAR are controlled mainly at the transcriptional level, but altered message stability and receptor recycling may represent other means of controlling the amount of this gene product at the cell surface (22Lengyel E. Wang H. Stepp E. Juarez J. Wang Y. Doe W. Pfarr C.M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23176-23184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Shetty S. Kumar A. Idell S.

The transcriptional regulation of the u-PAR gene is still poorly understood. Soravia et al. (26Soravia E. Grebe A. De Luca P. Helin K. Suh T.T. Degen J.L. Blasi F. Blood. 1995; 86: 624-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the basal expression of the gene was regulated via Sp1 motifs proximal and upstream of the transcriptional start site. Our laboratory showed that both the constitutive and PMA-inducible expression of the gene required a footprinted region (−190/−171) of the promoter containing an AP-1 motif (22Lengyel E. Wang H. Stepp E. Juarez J. Wang Y. Doe W. Pfarr C.M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23176-23184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We also observed a second footprinted region of the promoter (−148/−124), and deletion of this region caused a dramatic reduction in the constitutive u-PAR promoter activity in a colon cancer cell line characterized by its high expression of this gene. Interestingly, this region of the promoter contained noncanonical AP-2 (−142/−134) and Sp1 (−147/−138) motifs overlapping with each other as well as nonconsensus polyomavirus activator 3 (−133/−127) motifs. The u-PAR has been implicated in a number of physiological and pathological processes involving tissue remodeling, although it is not critical for mouse development (27Carmeliet P. Moons L. Dewerchin M. Rosenberg S. Herbert J. Lupu F. Collen D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In cancer, several experimental and clinical findings support the view that the u-PAR plays a prominent role in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. For example, the u-PAR mRNA is expressed in the tumor cells of invasive colon cancers (28Pyke C. Salo S. Ralfkiaer E. Romer J. Dano K. Tryggvason K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4132-4139PubMed Google Scholar,29Pyke C. Kristensen P. Ralfkiaer E. Grondahl-Hansen J. Eirksen J. Blasi F. Dano K. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1059-1067PubMed Google Scholar), and a high u-PAR protein level is predictive of short survival times for patients with this disease (30Ganesh S. Sier C.F.M. Heerding M.M. Griffioen G. Lamers C.B.H. Verspaget H.W. Lancet. 1994; 344: 401-402Abstract PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Further, earlier studies have shown that the overexpression of a human u-PAR cDNA increased the ability of human osteosarcoma cells to invade into an extracellular matrix-coated porous filter (31Kariko K. Kuo A. Boyd D. Okada S. Cines D. Barnathan E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3109-3117PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, down-regulating u-PAR levels using antisense expression constructs, oligonucleotides, or synthetic compounds reduced the ability of divergent invasive cancers to invade in vitro and in vivo (32Kook Y.H. Adamski J. Zelent A. Ossowski L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3983-3991Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 33Xing R.H. Mazar A. Henkin J. Rabbani S.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3585-3593PubMed Google Scholar, 34Quattrone A. Fibbi G. Anichini E. Pucci M. Zamperini A. Capaccioli S. Del Rosso M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 90-95PubMed Google Scholar, 35Min H.Y.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Since the u-PAR is a key factor in promoting tumor-associated proteolysis, down-regulation of its expression could be a promising strategy for inhibiting cancer invasion and metastasis. We therefore undertook a study with two objectives: (a) to identifycis-elements and trans-acting factors regulating constitutive and PMA-inducible u-PAR gene expression via the footprinted region spanning nucleotides −148/−124 and (b) to determine the effect of interfering with transcription factors binding to this region on u-PAR-directed laminin degradation. The u-PAR CAT reporter consisted of 449 base pairs of sequence (37Wang Y. Dang J. Johnson L.K. Selhamer J.J. Doe W.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) stretching from −398 to +51 (relative to the transcription start site) cloned into the XbaI site of the pCAT-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Reporter constructs regulated by truncated u-PAR promoter fragments were as described previously (22Lengyel E. Wang H. Stepp E. Juarez J. Wang Y. Doe W. Pfarr C.M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23176-23184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The urokinase CAT reporter consisted of 2345 base pairs of 5′-flanking region fused directly to the reporter (38Verde P. Boast S. Franze A. Robbiati F. Blasi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10699-10715Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Antibodies to Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and AP-2 isoforms were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The Jun-D expression construct was described elsewhere (22Lengyel E. Wang H. Stepp E. Juarez J. Wang Y. Doe W. Pfarr C.M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23176-23184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies (The Woodlands, TX). Recombinant AP-2αA and Sp1 (full-length human proteins) were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Expression vectors for AP-2αA, AP-2αB, and AP-2 antisense (39Buettner R. Kannan P. Imhof A. Bauer R. Yim S.O. Glockshuber R. Van Dyke M.W. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4174-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) consisted of the cloned sequences inserted into theEcoRI site of pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Tainsky. The AP-2 pBLCAT2 reporter construct contained three consensus AP-2 motifs 5′ of the pBLCAT2 reporter (40Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). For the generation of the R2 CAT reporter construct, an oligonucleotide spanning nucleotides −154/−128 was cloned into theXbaI site of pCATbasic (Promega). Nuclear extracts and EMSA were carried out as described elsewhere (22Lengyel E. Wang H. Stepp E. Juarez J. Wang Y. Doe W. Pfarr C.M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23176-23184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). EMSA was carried out using nuclear extract (8 μg), 0.6 μg of poly(dI/dC), and 2 × 104 cpm of a T4 polynucleotide kinase-labeled [γ-32P]ATP oligonucleotide. The sequences of the AP-2 and Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides were: 5′-GAT CGA ACT GAC CGC CCG CGG CCC GT-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-2513) and 5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-2502), respectively. The sequence of the mutated (underlined nucleotides) AP-2 consensus-containing oligonucleotide was 5′-GAT CGA ACT GAC CGC TTG CGG CCC GT-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-2516). This was performed according to the protocol of the Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (5Z701) ofCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). For generation of the Sp1/Sp3mt u-PAR CAT, pCATbasic (Promega) regulated by 398 base pairs of the u-PAR promoter (37Wang Y. Dang J. Johnson L.K. Selhamer J.J. Doe W.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) served as a template. A mutation primer substituting T for G at positions −148, −147, −144, and −142 and its corresponding selection primer (5′-CTTATCATGTCTGGTACCCCCGGAATTC-3′) converting the BamHI site of pCATbasic to a KpnI site were annealed to the denatured template plasmid, and the plasmid was amplified according to the protocol. Remaining wild-type plasmid was eliminated by two BamHI digestions for 4 h, each of them followed by transformation of nondigested DNA into BMH 71–18mutS cells (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). DNA of selected clones was isolated and sequenced using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech T7-Sequenase 2.0 Kit. For generation of the AP-2/Sp1/Sp3mt u-PAR CAT construct, the Sp1/Sp3mt u-PAR CAT plasmid served as a template. The second mutation primer substituted A for C at positions −146, −145, −142, and −141 of the u-PAR promoter, and the selection primer (5′-CTTATCATGTCTGGATCCCCCGGAATTC-3′) changed the KpnI site generated above back to BamHI. Selection for AP-2/Sp1/3-mutated plasmids was done by KpnI digestion. The procedure was continued as described above. Cells were transfected at 60% confluency using poly-l-ornithine as described previously (41Nead M.A. McCance D.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 668-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All transient transfections were performed in the presence of a luciferase expression vector (4 μg), and transfection efficiencies were determined by assaying for luciferase activity. CAT activity was measured as described previously (22Lengyel E. Wang H. Stepp E. Juarez J. Wang Y. Doe W. Pfarr C.M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23176-23184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The amount of acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was determined using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using ImageQuant software. Student's t test analysis was performed two-sided using the SPSS for Windows statistical software (release 6.1.3) (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Statistical significance was defined asp ≤ 0.05. Transfected cells were enriched by the MACS-Select method of Miltenyi Biotech (Auburn, CA). RKO cells were co-transfected with the AP-2αB expression construct and a plasmid encoding a mutated CD4 molecule (pMACS 4) in a 3:1 ratio. Cells were harvested after 42 h in 320 μl of PBE buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm EDTA) and incubated for 15 min with 80 μl of a magnetic bead-conjugated antibody directed against the mutated CD4 molecule. The cell suspension was then run through VS+ separation columns using the VarioMACS magnet according to the manufacturer's protocol. RKO cells were extracted into a buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA) for 10 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and 750 μg protein of cell extract was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 16 h with 0.25 μg of a polyclonal anti-u-PAR antibody and protein A-agarose beads. The polyclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Mazar, Angstrom Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA) was raised in rabbits against amino acids 1–281 of the human u-PAR and purified on a Sepharose-immobilized u-PAR column. The immunoprecipitated material was subjected to standard Western blotting (42Burnette W. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar), and the blot was probed with 5 μg/ml of an anti-u-PAR monoclonal antibody (catalog no. 3931, American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the determination of u-PAR by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, resected tissue was prepared as described by the manufacturer (American Diagnostica). These were carried out as described previously (43Schlechte W. Murano G. Boyd D.D. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6064-6069PubMed Google Scholar). RKO cells were harvested with 3 mm EDTA/phosphate-buffered saline, washed twice, and seeded (500,000 cells) on radioactive laminin-coated (2 μg/dish) dishes. The cells were allowed to attach overnight. Subsequently, cell surface u-PARs were saturated by incubating the cells at 37 °C for 30 min with 5 nm urokinase, and unbound plasminogen activator was removed by washing. The cells were then replenished with serum-free medium with or without 10 μg/ml plasminogen (final concentration). After varying times at 37 °C, aliquots of the culture medium were withdrawn and counted for radioactivity. Solubilized laminin represents the degraded glycoprotein (43Schlechte W. Murano G. Boyd D.D. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6064-6069PubMed Google Scholar). Region II of the u-PAR Promoter Footprinted by Nuclear Extract from a High u-PAR-expressing Cell Line Is Bound with Sp1, Sp3, and an AP-2α-related Factor—We previously reported (22Lengyel E. Wang H.

As a first step to identifying transcription factor(s) bound to this region, EMSA was carried out using an oligonucleotide spanning nucleotides −154/−128 (Fig.1 A). The oligonucleotide was not extended to the 3′-end (−124) of the footprinted region II, since preliminary EMSA utilizing a probe that included sequences 3′ of −128 had failed to reveal any specific binding complexes. Employing the −154/−128 oligonucleotide, three slower migrating bands (indicated by a brace, arrow, and asterisk) were apparent (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and8) with a 100-fold excess of the nonradioactive oligonucleotide eliminating (lane 3) all of these bands. Computer analysis of this region of the u-PAR promoter revealed the presence of putative AP-2- (−142/−134) and Sp1/Sp3- (−147/−138) binding motifs all bearing one mismatch with the corresponding canonical (AP-2, GCCNNNGGC; Sp1, RYYCCGCCCM) sequences. The addition of a 100-fold excess of a consensus AP-2-containing oligonucleotide (Fig.1 B, lane 7 and 11) from the human metallothionein IIa promoter sequence (44Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) eliminated one of the shifted bands (*). In contrast, substitution of this oligonucleotide at the AP-2 motif (CC to TT) prevented it from competing for the shifted bands (Fig. 1 B, lane 10). Increasing amounts of a nonradioactive oligonucleotide bearing a consensus Sp1 motif caused a dose-dependent decrease in the intensity of two of the shifted bands (indicated with a brace andarrow) (Fig. 1 C) while having little effect on the band (*) competed with the AP-2 motif-containing oligonucleotide. The ability of the consensus Sp1 motif to compete for the binding of nuclear-extracted proteins to the u-PAR promoter footprinted region II oligonucleotide suggested that transcription factors recognized by these motifs were bound to the u-PAR promoter. To examine this possibility, “supershifting” experiments were carried out. The addition of an anti-Sp1-specific antibody to the RKO nuclear extract resulted (Fig. 1 B, lane 4) in a slower migrating band (indicated with a line) with a concomitant decreased intensity of the complex (indicated by a brace) competed with the Sp1 consensus sequence. On the other hand, the addition of an antibody against Sp2 had no effect (lane 5) on the migration pattern, while an antibody directed at the DNA-binding domain of Sp3 completely abolished (Fig. 1 B,lane 6) the shifted band with the intermediate mobility (arrow). These data suggested that the region of the u-PAR promoter footprinted with nuclear extract from a high u-PAR-expressing cell line (22Lengyel E. Wang H. Stepp E. Juarez J. Wang Y. Doe W. Pfarr C.M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23176-23184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) is bound with Sp1 and Sp3. Since the fastest migrating complex evident in the EMSA (indicated by an asterisk) was competed with an AP-2 consensus motif (Fig.1 B), we hypothesized that the bound protein was an AP-2 isoform. To test this hypothesis, two sets of experiments were carried out. First, RKO nuclear extract was mixed with 2 μg of an anti-AP-2α antibody or an equal amount of IgG and subsequently with protein A-agarose beads. The supernatant (depleted of AP-2α-immunoreactive proteins) was then used in band shifting experiments. The fastest migrating band (*), which was competed with an excess of the AP-2 consensus, was practically abolished (Fig.1 D) by treatment of the nuclear extract with the anti-AP-2α antibody, whereas the bands recognized by the Sp1 (brace) and Sp3 (arrow) antibodies were unaffected. Further, the IgG control had no effect on the intensity or mobility of any of the shifted bands and antibodies specific for AP-2β, or AP-2γ failed to deplete the RKO nuclear extract of the binding factor (Fig. 1 E). Second, we determined if authentic AP-2α could bind to the u-PAR promoter region II. In EMSA using an oligonucleotide spanning −154/−128, authentic AP-2α (Promega) gave rise to a shifted band (line) (Fig.2), which could be competed with an excess of either the u-PAR region II oligonucleotide (−154/−128) or a consensus AP-2 motif. The authentic AP-2α bound to the −154/−128 probe had a different mobility from the retarded band (which was removed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-AP-2α antibody; Fig.1 D) observed using RKO nuclear extract (*). To delineate the minimal sequence of footprinted region II required for the binding of Sp1/Sp3 and the factor recognized by the anti-AP-2α antibody, band-shifting experiments were carried out with the u-PAR promoter oligonucleotide truncated from either the 5′- or 3′-end (Fig.3 A). The removal of two base pairs at the 5′ terminus (generating oligonucleotide −152/−128) had little effect on the intensities of the Sp1- (brace) and Sp3- (arrow) bound complexes when compared with probe −154/−128. However, a severe attenuation in the binding of these factors was apparent with further truncation from the 5′-end as evident with probe −150/−128. These data suggested that nucleotides 5′ of the nonconsensus Sp1 motif (−147/−138) are required for the optimal binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to region II of the u-PAR promoter. On the other hand, the fastest migrating band (*), which is recognized by the anti-AP-2α antibody, was unaffected by the removal of 5′ nucleotides with binding maintained with probe −143/−128. These data rule out the possibility that an AP-2-like motif located further upstream (−151/−143) is mediating the binding of this factor to region II of the u-PAR promoter. While the binding of Sp1/Sp3 and the AP-2α antibody-reactive factor demonstrated different 5′ requirements, the binding of these transcription factors showed identical requirements for 3′ sequences. Thus, the removal of up to 5 base pairs from the 3′ terminus of oligonucleotide −154/−130 (generating oligonucleotide −154/−135) had little effect on transcription factor binding. However, the deletion of an additional 3 base pairs from the 3′-end (oligonucleotide −154/−138) completely abolished the binding of these three transcription factors. Thus, sequences in the u-PAR promoter extending 3′ to −135 are required for the optimal binding of Sp1, Sp3, and the factor recognized by the anti-AP-2α antibody.Figure 3Identification of minimal sequences of footprinted region II required for binding of nucleus-derived transcription factors from RKO cells.

After this time, 2 μg of the indicated antibody was added to the reaction mixture where indicated. Binding complexes were subsequently analyzed by EMSA.

The insect immune response to parasites and pathogens involves the action of different classes of blood cells (hemocytes), which adhere to and spread across the surface of foreign targets. In phylogenetically advanced insects like the Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), plasmatocytes and granular cells are the two most important classes of hemocytes involved in cellular defense responses like encapsulation and clotting (3Strand M.R. Pech L.L. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1995; 40: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). However, relatively little is known about the factors mediating the movement and action of these immune cells (3Strand M.R. Pech L.L. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1995; 40: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The identification of a peptide that induces the adhesion and spreading of plasmatocytes on foreign surfaces was recently reported (1Clark K.D. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol.

Although the existence of cytokine-like factors to regulate hemocyte activity has been proposed previously (3Strand M.R. Pech L.L. Annu. Rev.

Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, the growth-blocking peptide (GBP) ofPseudaletia separata and the paralytic peptides fromManduca sexta, Heliothis virescens, andSpodoptera exigua have high (>70%) sequence identity with PSP1, including the two cysteine residues and a highly conserved glycine. High sequence variabilty within this group is found only at positions 4 and 8. Some similarity between the sequences of GBP and human epidermal growth factor has been recently suggested (4Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and this would extend to PSP1 and the paralytic peptides. Chemically synthesized PSP1 was shown to induce an identical plasmatocyte spreading and adhesion response to the peptide purified from the plasma of P. includens larvae and is therefore suitable for detailed structure-function analysis (1Clark K.D. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Here we report the three-dimensional structure of this novel insect cytokine determined by NMR spectroscopy and torsion angle dynamics calculations. The structure of PSP1 shows clear homology to the C-terminal subdomain of the EGF domain family. The backbone conformation of PSP1 is very similar to that of the fifth EGF-like domain of the human anticoagulant protein thrombomodulin (hTM5), despite sharing sequence identity at only four positions, including the two cysteines of the conserved disulfide. PSP1 was synthesized usingtert-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry and purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Its identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and NMR. The NMR sample consisted of 2 mg of pure lyophilized peptide, dissolved in 500 μl of a buffer containing 90% H2O/10% D2O, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. All NMR spectra were recorded at 10 °C on Bruker DMX750 and DMX500 spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance (1H/13C/15N) probes and with Z− or three–axis pulsed field gradient capabilities. Quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimensions was obtained with the States-TPPI method (5Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3514) Google Scholar). Water suppression was achieved using a watergate sequence with a 3-9-19 selective inversion pulse (6Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). A two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy spectrum with an isotropic mixing period of 67 ms was acquired at 499.84 MHz, with spectral widths of 6009.6 Hz in both dimensions and time domain data sizes of 2048 and 256 complex points in the direct and indirect dimensions, respectively. A two-dimensional NOESY spectrum with a 300-ms mixing time was acquired at 750.13 MHz with spectral widths of 8892.8 Hz in both dimensions and time domain data sizes of 1024 and 256 complex points in the direct and indirect dimensions, respectively. All Fourier transformations of NMR data were performed with Felix 95.0 (Molecular Simulations) or NMRPipe (7Delagalio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293PubMed Google Scholar). Time domain data in both dimensions were apodized with a squared cosine bell prior to zero filling to the final matrix size, Fourier transformation, and phase correction. The initial value for the incremented delay was set in a manner that allowed predictable phasing in each dimension and minimized roll and offset of the base line (8Bax A. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Zhu G. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 91: 174-178Google Scholar). All 1H dimensions were referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. Sequential resonance assignments for the backbone were obtained manually from analysis of the total correlation spectroscopy and NOESY spectra (9Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Subsequent assignment of side chains and NOEs for structure calculations were obtained with the programs Garant (10Bartels C. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and XEASY (11Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Structures were calculated with the torsion angle dynamics approach of the program DYANA 1.5 (12Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar) using the anneal.dya macro with 4000 steps/structure in the early stages of refinement and 20,000 steps in the final rounds, followed by 1000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. Distance constraint upper bounds were generated with the CALIBA function of DYANA. For the initial round of structure calculations, sequential and intraresidue NOEs assigned by Garant, as well as a small number of manually assigned additional medium and long range NOEs were used as input restraints. Each round started with 60 randomized conformers, from which the 30 with the lowest target function were used to analyze constraint violations and assign additional NOE constraints (in Garant or XEASY) for the following round of refinement. This process was repeated until all peaks in the spectrum had been assigned and all consistent violations were eliminated. In the later stages of refinement, the GLOMSA routine of DYANA was applied to the set of restraints and ensemble of structures to obtain a small number of stereospecific assignments based on differences in NOE intensities for diastereotopic groups. From the total of 60 structures calculated in the final round of refinement, the 30 conformers with the lowest target function were considered for analysis. The mean structure calculated in MOLMOL (13Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6454) Google Scholar) from this ensemble of 30 structures was minimized in DYANA with 1000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization and reported as the representative PSP1 structure. All analyses of root mean square deviation, secondary structure, and hydrogen bonds were performed with MOLMOL. Two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to obtain complete resonance assignments for chemically synthesized plasmatocyte-spreading peptide 1 (PSP1). 2Chemical shift assignments of PSP1 have been deposited in the BioMagResBank Data Base (accession number 4292). As shown in Fig.2, the chemical shift dispersion and large number of NOEs observed indicate the presence of well defined secondary and tertiary structure. A total of 699 cross-peaks were assigned in the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum of PSP1, from which 333 nontrivial NOE distance constraints were produced after discarding duplicate and structurally redundant NOEs. Two additional pairs of upper and lower bound distance constraints were included between the Sγ and Cβ atoms of Cys7 and Cys19 to produce normal disulfide bond geometry (2.0 Å < dS−S < 2.1 Å, 3.72 Å < dCβ−Cβ< 3.99 Å). A summary of all 337 distance constraints by class is given in Table I, and the distribution of constraints by residue is shown in Fig.3. Stereospecific assignments were obtained from analysis of structures and NOE intensities for the Hα protons of Gly17, the Hβprotons of Tyr11 and Pro21, and the Hγ and Hδ protons of Pro21.Table IStructural statistics for 30 PSP1 conformersNOE constraint totals by typeNumberLong92Medium73Short109Intraresidue59Disulfide4Total337Constraints/residue14.6DYANA parameters〈TAD〉〈TAD〉rTarget function (Å2)0.12 ± 0.020.13Upper limit violationsNumber > 0.1 Å4 ± 13Sum of violations (Å)1.3 ± 0.11.2Maximum violation (Å)0.19 ± 0.000.19Van der Waals' violationsNumber > 0.1 Å0 ± 00Sum of violations (Å)0.2 ± 0.10.3Maximum violation (Å)0.05 ± 0.010.05Average atomic RMSD (Å)aAtomic RMSDs were calculated by superposition of either backbone N, Cα, C′ atoms or all nonhydrogen atoms for residues 7–22.N, Cα, C′All nonhydrogen〈TAD〉 vs.〈 TAD 〉0.18 ± 0.080.81 ± 0.20〈TAD〉 vs.〈 TAD 〉min0.23 ± 0.100.94 ± 0.24〈TAD〉 pairwise0.27 ± 0.111.15 ± 0.30〈TAD〉, the ensemble of 30 DYANA torsion angle dynamics (TAD) conformers; 〈 TAD 〉, the average coordinates obtained from a least squares superposition of residues 7–22; 〈 TAD 〉min, the structure obtained by applying 1000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization to the mean structure, 〈 TAD 〉.a Atomic RMSDs were calculated by superposition of either backbone N, Cα, C′ atoms or all nonhydrogen atoms for residues 7–22.

The ensemble of 30 PSP1 conformers, which resulted from the final stage of refinement, is shown in Fig. 4. The low average target function (0.12 ± 0.02 Å2) indicates good agreement between the ensemble of calculated conformers and the experimental constraints. Superposition of the well ordered residues (7–22) of this ensemble onto the corresponding residues of the mean structure produced an average RMSD to the mean of 0.18 Å for the backbone atoms and 0.84 Å for all nonhydrogen atoms. After minimization of the mean structure in DYANA to a final target function of 0.13, the average RMSD for residues 7–22 became 0.23 Å for the backbone and 0.98 Å for the heavy atoms. A summary of residual violations and RMSDs is given in Table I. The tertiary structure of PSP1 is stabilized by a combination of the covalent disulfide linkage, hydrogen bonding within the β-hairpin structure, and hydrophobic side chain packing. All 30 torsion angle dynamics conformers were consistent with a pair of hydrogen bonds involving the backbone amide and carbonyl groups of Met12and Lys20. Evidence for two additional hydrogen bonds (Asp16 HN–Thr14 Oγ1, Thr14 HN–Arg18 O) was observed in a subset of the family of structures. Within the ordered portion of the molecule, a subset of side chains forms a well defined hydrophobic core centered around the side chain of Tyr11. This residue, conserved throughout the family of EGF-like domains as a phenylalanine or tyrosine (14Appella E. Weber I.T. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), has NOE contacts to the side chains of Cys7, Leu8, Ala9, Cys19, Pro21, and Phe23. The opposite side of the structure is largely composed of exposed and disordered charged residues, including Arg13, Asp16, Arg18, and Lys20. As seen in Fig. 1, the sequences of PSP1, GBP from Pseudaletia separata, and a paralytic peptide from M. sexta differ in very few positions, and all may be expected to adopt the same three-dimensional structures. Although the structures of these related peptides have not been reported, preliminary analysis of the NOESY spectrum of GBP indicates that its structure will be very similar to that reported here for PSP1. 3B. F. Volkman, unpublished results. Consistent with this result are functional assays using both PSP1 and GBP that show no significant differences in activity. 4K. D. Clark, unpublished results. EGF-like domains are peptides of approximately 40 residues in length, containing six highly conserved cysteine residues. Three loops, designated A, B, and C, are defined by the pattern of disulfide bonding. EGF modules are alternatively described in terms of two subdomains, each containing a β-hairpin structure. The N-terminal EGF-like subdomain consists of the first two disulfide-linked loops, and the smaller C-terminal subdomain consists of the third disulfide and the C loop. The structures of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) (15Hommel U. Harvey T.S. Driscol P.C. Campbell I.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and the hTM5 (16Sampoli-Benitez B.A. Hunter M.J. Meininger D.P. Komives E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which have been determined by NMR spectroscopy, share the general structural features of the family of EGF-like domains. The variability of the EGF family is illustrated by the differences between these two structures, including alternative pairing for the first two disulfides and a longer C loop in hTM5 than hEGF (16Sampoli-Benitez B.A. Hunter M.J. Meininger D.P. Komives E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sequence identity between PSP1 and these representatives of the family of EGF-like domains is limited to the essential cysteine, glycine, and tyrosine residues of the C-terminal EGF-like subdomain (Fig. 1), but PSP1 has an extended C loop as found in hTM5. The backbone conformations of these three peptides are compared in Fig.5. Except for the displacement of the β-turn in hEGF, resulting from its shorter C loop, the structures of all three molecules are quite similar. PSP1 and hTM5 align to a remarkably high degree, with an average backbone atomic RMSD of ∼1 Å for the 13 residues within the disulfide loop. PSP1 was isolated as the peptide responsible for spreading of insect cell plasmatocytes on foreign surfaces, an important process in cellular defense. Hence, it will be of interest to determine the cellular receptor for this peptide. Given the striking similarity between the structure of PSP1 and the C-terminal subdomain of EGF-like modules, it is tempting to speculate that the ligand-receptor interactions of PSP1 may be analogous to those of the array of EGF domain-receptor complexes that have been investigated (17McInnes C. Sykes B.D. Biopolymers. 1998; 43: 339-366Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the minimized mean structure of PSP1, including all side chains. The charged residues Arg13, Asp16, Arg18, and Lys20 are clearly clustered on one side of the molecule, and the patch of hydrophobic residues surrounding the Tyr11side chain are located on the opposing side. No consensus receptor-binding site has been identified yet for EGF receptor ligands, despite intense efforts (17McInnes C. Sykes B.D. Biopolymers. 1998; 43: 339-366Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) stemming from the relevance of this system to the design of potential drugs for treating human cancers. However, the studies have determined that an arginine conserved in EGF receptor binding domains (Arg41 in hEGF) is essential for binding. Interestingly, Arg18 is the analogous residue in PSP1. Significant effort has been spent investigating the details of thrombin recognition by thrombomodulin, including alanine-scanning mutagenesis, NMR spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography of the complexes between small peptide fragments of hTM5 and thrombin (18Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mathews I.I. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Sadler J.E.

Although the distinction between residues critical for proper folding and those directly involved in binding may not be entirely clear from mutagenesis alone, a structural interpretation clearly implicates the C loop of hTM5, including the many acidic side chains on either side of Cys421 (Fig. 1). None of these residues has a direct correlation, but the cluster of charged side chains occurs in the same vicinity of the PSP1 structure. In the absence of other information on the activity of PSP1, this concentration of acidic and basic residues is an obvious starting point for investigations of the receptor-binding determinants of this new class of insect cytokine peptides.

https://openalex.org/W2039268577,"Abstract The α5 subunit is a component of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are probably involved in the activation step of the catecholamine secretion process in bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells. The promoter of the gene coding for this subunit was isolated, and its proximal region was characterized, revealing several GC boxes located close to the site of transcription initiation (from −111 to −40). Deletion analysis and transient transfections showed that a 266-base pair region (−111 to +155) gave rise to ∼77 and 100% of the maximal transcriptional activity observed in chromaffin and SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of five different GC motifs indicated that all of them contribute to the activity of the α5 gene, but in a different way, depending on the type of transfected cell. Thus, in SHSY-5Y cells, alteration of the most promoter-proximal of the GC boxes decreased α5 promoter activity by ∼50%, whereas single mutations of the other GC boxes had no effect. In chromaffin cells, by contrast, modification of any of the GC boxes produced a similar decrease in promoter activity (50–69%). In both cell types, however, activity was almost abolished when four GC boxes were suppressed simultaneously. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from either chromaffin or SHSY-5Y cells showed the specific binding of Sp1 protein to fragment −111 to −27. Binding of Sp1 to the GC boxes was also demonstrated by DNase I footprint analysis. This study suggests that the general transcription factor Sp1 plays a dominant role in α5 subunit expression, as has also been demonstrated previously for α3 and β4 subunits. Since these three subunits have their genes tightly clustered and are expressed in chromaffin cells, probably as components of the same receptor subtype, we propose that Sp1 constitutes the key factor of a regulatory mechanism common to the three subunits."

These effects are achieved through the interaction of GTP-bound proteins with various downstream targets. A series of RhoA/Rac1 and Rho/Ras chimeras was generated to map the domain(s) of RhoA involved in its association with two classes of effector kinase, represented by PRK2 and ROCK-I. Although the switch 1 domain was required for effector binding, the N terminus of Rho (residues 1–75) was interchangeable with that of Rac. This suggested that the region of Rho that confers effector binding specificity lay further C-terminal. Subsequent studies indicated that the “insert domain”(residues 123–137), a region unique to Rho family GTPases, is not the specificity determinant. However, a determinant for effector binding was identified between Rho residues 75–92. Rac to Rho point mutations (V85D or A88D) within loop 6 of Rac promoted its association with PRK2 and ROCK, whereas the reciprocal Rho(D87V/D90A) double mutant significantly reduced effector binding capacity. In vivostudies showed that microinjection of Rac(Q6IL/V85D/A88D) but not Rac(Q6IL) induced stress fiber formation in LLC-PK epithelial cells, suggesting that loop 6 residues conferred the ability of Rac to activate ROCK. On the other hand, the reciprocal Rho (Q6IL/D87V/D90A) mutant was defective in its ability to transform NIH 3T3 cells. These data suggest that although Rho effectors can utilize a Rho or Rac switch 1 domain to sense the GTP-bound state of Rho, unique residues within loop 6 are essential for determining both effector binding specificity and cellular function.

The Ras superfamily of GTPases is involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes, including signal transduction to induce growth and differentiation (Ras), membrane trafficking (Rab), nuclear transport (Ran), and cytoskeletal regulation (Rho) (1Macara I.G.

The best characterized members of the Rho family of GTPases are RhoA, Rac 1, and CDC42Hs, which regulate stress fiber formation, lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling, and filopodia formation, respectively (2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Rac and CDC42 also regulate transcription via activation of the JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, whereas all three Rho family members can activate the serum response factor (4Hill C.S.

Ras superfamily proteins act as molecular switches, alternating between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. GTP binding induces a conformational change in two domains of Ras, referred to as switch 1 and switch 2 (7Wittinghofer A. Franken S.M. Scheidig A.J. Rensland H. Lautwein A. Pai E.F. Goody R.S. Ciba Found. Symp. 1993; 176: 6-27PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of Ha-Ras, effector protein binding and activation occurs primarily through association with the switch 1 domain located in loop 2 and β-strand 2 (residues 32–40) (3Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Indeed, point mutations within this region of Ras can differentially disrupt its interaction with various downstream targets (8Stone J.C. Colleton M. Bottorff D. Mol. Cell.

These include an α-helix located between residues 123–137 that is unique to Rho family members (henceforth referred to as the “insert domain”) and a region located between residues 143–175 (15Freeman J.L.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 655-661PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that in contrast to Ras, the effector-binding domain of Rho extends beyond switch 1. For example, a Rac73Rho chimera, lacking Rho N-terminal sequences could still induce stress fiber formation (16Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, we set out to determine which regions of Rho are involved in its interaction with the downstream effectors PRK2 and p160 ROCK (18Narumiya S. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). PRK2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase isolated by us and others (5Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A.

Meanwhile, the Rho kinases (ROKα/ROCK-II/Rho-kinase and ROKβ/ROCK-I/p160 ROCK) that mediate Rho-induced stress fiber formation possess a distinct Rho-binding structure (23Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), referred to herein as RBD. Although HR1 and RBD do not share primary sequence homology, they are both highly charged and are predicted to contain significant α-helical content. It was therefore of interest to determine whether or not the same domains of Rho recognized both classes of effector-binding motif. homology region glutathione S-transferase maltose-binding protein Rho binding domain of ROCK-1 polymerase chain reaction hemagglutinin wild type guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) Using Rho/Rac chimeras, we demonstrate here that multiple domains of Rho are involved in effector binding. Although switch 1 domain residues common to both Rho and Rac are required for binding Rho-effectors, unique residues in loop 6 of Rho confer specific interaction with Rho targets. In vivo data demonstrated that loop 6 of Rho not only distinguishes between Rho and Rac effectors but also is required for their physiological activation. Deletion of the Rho insert domain (residues 123–137) severely disrupted Rho-induced transformation but did not significantly disrupt PRK2 or ROCK-I binding to Rho in vitro. The loss of transformation resulting from insert domain deletion may have been due to requirement of the insert helix for activation of an additional Rho target. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that its deletion resulted in disruption of the adjacent loop 6 structure. [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Vent DNA polymerase and all restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. PCR cloning vector pCR Blunt was from Invitrogen. M2-FLAG and hemaglutinin antibodies were from Sigma and Berkeley Antibody Co., respectively. All the Rho mutants and Rho/Rac chimera constructs used in this study are summarized in Fig.1. Rho and Rac mutants are offset by two codons due to the longer N terminus of RhoA. The Rac(Val12)143Rho, Rac73Rho143Rac, and Rho(G14V/T37A) constructs have been described previously (16Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and were provided by A. Hall (University College, London, United Kingdom). Rho(F39A), Rho(D87V/D90A), Rac(V85D/A88D), Rac(V85D), and Rac(A88D) mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR. Rho122Rac139Rho (RhoΔRac) was created by PCR using long oligonucleotides that replaced the Rho insert domain (codons 123 to 138) with that of Rac. RhoΔRas mutations were also created using this strategy, replacing codons 122–141 of Rho with codons 121–127 of Ha-Ras. The Rho75Rac and Rac73Rho chimeras were made by swapping the N terminus of Rho/Rac, using the PvuII site at codon 59 (residues 59–73 are identical between Rho and Rac). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate wild type Rho75Rac92Rho and Rac73Rho90Rac using Rho75Rac92Rho(Leu63) and Rac73Rho90Rac(Leu61) (16Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) as PCR templates. Rho92Rac and Rac90Rho were constructed by swapping the N-terminal 59 amino acids of Rho75Rac92Rho and Rac73Rho90Rac, taking advantage of the codon 59 PvuII common to the chimeras. All mutants were subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate GST fusion protein or into pZIP (24Cepko C.L. Roberts B.E. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1984; 37: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) or pCGN for expression in mammalian cells. Codons 905–1046 of p160 ROCK were PCR-amplified from a human small intestine Marathon-ready cDNA library (CLONTECH). Codons 1–284 (HR1), 36–113 (HR1a), 133–208 (HR1b), and 210–284 (HR1c) were amplified from PRK2 by PCR. All constructs were subcloned into pGEX-2T and pMal-c (New England Biolabs) to generate GST and maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins, respectively. pCMV2-FLAG-PRK2 has been described previously (5Quilliam L.A.

GST-fused Rho GTPases were expressed in the BL21(DE3)lysE strain of Escherichia coli. Following a 3-h induction with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C, cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm GDP, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1.9 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After sonication to lyse the cells, the supernatant was tumbled with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer and stored at 4 °C. GST-fused HR1 and RBD were purified similarly except for using 1 mm EDTA instead of MgCl2 and GDP in the lysis buffer. MBP fusion proteins were also purified in a similar manner except for using amylose beads (New England Biolabs) and the following lysis buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.9 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Rac proteins for microinjection studies were cleaved from GST using 10 units of thrombin in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C overnight. After removing thrombin with p-aminobenzamidine beads (Sigma), the supernatants were dialyzed against 15 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 12 h and concentrated using an Amicon Centricon filter, as described (25Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The active Rac protein concentration was estimated by [32P]GTP loading (26Quilliam L.A. Der C.J. Clark R. O'Rourke E.C. Zhang K. McCormick F. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2901-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Bead-bound Rho proteins were loaded with [α-32P]GTP by incubation for 20 min at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 μm GTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. MgCl2 was added to 10 mm to stop the reaction, and free nucleotide was removed by washing beads three times with the loading buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 in place of GTP/EDTA. Proteins were then eluted by incubating beads with 100 μl of 20 mm glutathione, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol on ice for 20 min. HR1a and RBD proteins were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% Tween-20 for 2 h. The membrane was then incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with 25 pmol of [α-32P]GTP-bound Rho (determined by scintillation counting) in blocking buffer supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 and 100 μm GDP. Following extensive washing in binding buffer, the membrane was autoradiographed at –80 °C to visualized the binding of Rho to its effectors. The GTP binding capacity of each Rho mutant was determined as above, using [α-32P]GTP. 2.5 μg of active GST-fused GTPases was then preloaded with unlabeled GTPγS or GDP and eluted off glutathione-agarose beads as described above. Subsequently, the proteins were incubated with 5 μg of MBP-fused HR1 or 1 μg of MBP-fused RBD immobilized on amylose beads in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm GTP at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed three times in the above buffer (except for 0.1% Triton X-100), and bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The binding of GST-Rho/Rac to HR1 and RBD was then determined by Western blotting using “in-house” anti-GST polyclonal antibody and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) detection. COS cells were transfected with pCMV2-FLAG-Prk2 using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 days, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1.9 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 2 μg of active bead-bound GTPases was preloaded with GTPγS as described above. Equal amounts of cell lysate supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 and 50 μm GTP were incubated with each GTPase at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed three times with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The binding of PRK2 to immobilized GTPases was determined by Western blotting with M2 anti-FLAG antibody. WT RhoA was preloaded with [α-32P]GTP as described above. 25 pmol of active Rho was then incubated with 400 μg of GST (as control) or different amounts of GST-HR1a (0.5–12.5 nmol/16–400 μg) on ice for 1 h to allow ligand binding. Subsequently, 500 μl of GTP exchange buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm GTP) was added to each sample, and exchange reactions were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at the indicated time points, and reactions were terminated by addition of 500 μl of ice-cold GTP exchange buffer. Protein-bound nucleotide was then captured on BA85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell), which were washed three times with 1 ml of cold GTP exchange buffer prior to scintillation counting. LLC-PK cells were maintained in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For microinjection experiments, cells were plated on coverslips and grown to >90% confluence. Cells were then co-microinjected with the indicated Rac proteins (60 μg/ml), botulinum exoenzyme C3 (10 μg/ml), and fluoroscein-conjugated dextran as described. 2N. Raman and S. J. Atkinson, submitted for publication. C3 exoenzyme was also prepared as described.2 After 45 min, cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, and F-actin was visualized using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. For transformation assays, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 2 μg of empty pZIP vector or vector encoding Rho(Q63L), Rho(Q63L/D87V/D90A) or RhoΔRas(Leu63) along with 1 μg of additional pZIP vector or pZIP-Raf(Y340D), as indicated, using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (27Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in regular growth medium, and transforming foci were fixed and stained with crystal violet after 12–16 days of culture. To create stable cell lines, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pCGN plasmids containing the above mutants and selected on growth medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. At least 100 colonies were pooled and immunoblotted for HA-tagged Rho expression approximately 3 weeks posttransfection. PRK2 and the related kinase PKN/PRK1 possess three tandem copies of a 60–70-amino acid sequence at their N terminus that has been referred to as homology region 1 (HR1) (Ref. 19Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and Fig.2 a). Single HR1 units are also present in other Rho-binding proteins (Rhophilin and Rhotekin) and appear to represent a common Rho binding motif (18Narumiya S. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Another Rho-binding motif, RBD (Fig. 2 b), that is present in ROCK does not share significant primary sequence homology with HR1 (23Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Both domains, however, are highly charged and predicted to contain significant α-helical content. We therefore established in vitro binding assays to determine whether these two distinct structures interacted with common domains of Rho. Fig. 2 cshows that interaction of RhoA-GTP with the HR1 region of PRK2 occurs primarily via the N-terminal-most repeat, HR1a. Weaker interaction was detectable with the HR1b but not with the HR1c domain. This is in agreement with Flynn et al. (28Flynn P. Mellor H. Palmer R. Panayotou G. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2698-2705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), who similarly found that Rho predominantly bound to the HR1a domain of PRK1/PKN. Binding of Rho to both HR1a and HR1b was determined to be GTP-dependent. RhoA-GTP also bound to the RBD of p160 ROCK (Fig. 2 d). Although ROCK-RBD has been reported to interact with Rac (13Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 14Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. Van Aelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), under our assay conditions (Fig. 2 d) and those described by Leung et al. (29Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there was no interaction of RBD with WT Rac1-GTP. We therefore generated a series of Rho/Rac chimeras to map which domains of Rho are required for its specific interaction with PRK2 and ROCK-1. Introduction of residues from Rho into the switch 1 domain of Rac has previously been shown to disrupt various Rac functions (12Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). However, we found that a Rac73Rho chimera (containing residues 1–73 of Rac1) still bound to HR1 and RBD, suggesting that either a Rac or a Rho switch 1 domain could support Rho-effector interaction (see Fig.3). In contrast, introduction of a Rho T37A mutation into Rho disrupted its ability to bind the PRK2-HR1 domain. A similar observation was previously reported for PKN (30Shibata H. Mukai H. Inagaki Y.

However, this mutation may disrupt the interaction of Thr37 with Mg2+ and the γ-phosphate of GTP that is necessary for the switch 1 domain to adopt its active conformation (7Wittinghofer A.

The F39A mutation totally abolished the ability of Rho to bind to both HR1 and ROCK-RBD, suggesting that the switch 1 domain does indeed contribute to effector binding but does not determine the specificity of Rho-effector interaction. The GTP dependence of Rho-effector binding (Fig. 2) was also supportive of the involvement of switch 1. However, because Rac does not normally interact with PRK2 or ROCK (5Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Der C.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), then the C-terminal two-thirds of Rho must determine effector binding specificity. The highly charged insert domain has been postulated to be an effector binding determinant and has been reported to be required for Rac-induced activation of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase (15Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19794-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 32Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because the HR1 and RBD sequences are also highly charged and could possibly associate with the insert domain via ionic interaction, we exchanged the entire insert domain of Rho with that of Rac. As seen in Fig. 4, the Rho123Rac138Rho chimera (RhoΔRac) still bound efficiently to HR1a and RBD, suggesting that the insert domain did not dictate Rho effector binding specificity. Although introduction of the Rac insert domain did not lead to loss of Rho-effector binding, this sequence possesses a very similar conformation and charge distribution to that of Rho, having highly charged residues on the outer surface of the helix and long-chain hydrophobic residues on the inner side facing loop 6 (34Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 35Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X. Minor W. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). So, just as residues 1–73 of Rac could replace residues 1–75 of Rho, it was possible that the insert domains may also be interchangeable. To determine whether the insert domain is involved in Rho-effector binding, we removed this region, replacing it with the corresponding sequence from loop 8 of Ras. This swap was equivalent to that previously made in CDC42 by McCallum et al. (36McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21732-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which also removes prolines 138 and 141 to minimize disruption of the global structure. This RhoΔRas mutant still interacted with PRK2 and ROCK-RBD (Fig. 4), indicating that the insert domain is not essential for PRK or ROCK family binding. Although RhoΔRas did not bind to effectors quite as effectively as WT Rho (∼60% binding), it was not as efficiently expressed in E. coli and bound fewer mol of GTP/mg of total protein (Fig. 4), suggesting that the decreased binding may just reflect recombinant protein instability. To identify regions of Rho outside of the classic switch domains that confer effector binding specificity, we used an additional series of Rho/Rac chimeras. Although a Rac143Rho chimera was ineffective, Rac73Rho143Rac still bound to both HR1 and RBD (Fig. 4). This suggested that a region between residues 75 and 143 of Rho is sufficient for effector binding. This notion is supported by the observation that Rac73Rho143Rac induced stress fiber formation in Swiss 3T3 cells as effectively as Rho (16Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The significant decrease in binding of HR1 and RBD to Rac73Rho143Rac, as with RhoΔRas, was very likely due to the poor GTP binding capacity of Rac73Rho143Rac (Fig. 4). Because the RhoΔRac and RhoΔRas chimeras that still bound Rho targets encompassed residues 123–138, we concluded that the Rho-effector-binding domain lay between residues 75 and 123. This was confirmed using a Rho122Rac chimera, which bound to both effectors. 3H. Zong and L. A. Quilliam, unpublished observations. Additionally, because a Rho92Rac but not a Rac90Rho chimera could efficiently interact with HR1a and RBD (Fig. 5 a), the Rho-effector-binding sequence was further narrowed down to Rho residues 76–92. Although we previously found no interaction between full-length PRK2 and Rac1-GTP in precipitation experiments (5Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K.

This report describes the design of potent DNA based antagonists of DNA MeTase and their utilization to define the interactions of DNA MeTase with its substrate and to study its biological role.

The inhibitors developed in this study are the first documented example of direct inhibitors of DNA MeTase in living cells and of modified oligonucleotides as bona fide antagonists of critical cellular proteins. DNA-binding proteins that regulate gene expression play an important biological role and are potentially attractive therapeutic targets. However, the study of their role in different physiological and pathological processes has been hindered by the lack of specific inhibitors. These proteins are especially appealing as drug targets because their ligand is a DNA sequence that can be identified by standard molecular biology techniques and can be synthesized and modified by well established chemistries (1Sproat B. J. Biotech. 1995; 41: 221-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, recent observations suggest that double-stranded DNA-based oligonucleotides bearing transcription factor recognition sites can be delivered into cells in culture and in vivo and exhibit pharmacological effects (2Akhtar S. Agrawal S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 12-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 3Tracewell W. Desjardins J. Iversen P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1995; 135: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A major limitation of this approach is that oligonucleotide antagonists that are identical to the transcription factors cognate site act as stochiometric competitors. Therefore, very high intracellular concentrations are required to effectively engage all the transcription factor available in the cell at all times. An ideal DNA-binding protein antagonist should exhibit higher affinity to the protein than the cognate sequence and bear a slow off rate. In this report we have tested the hypothesis that DNA-based inhibitors of DNA-binding proteins that address these requirements could be developed, using the DNA methyltransferase enzyme (DNA MeTase) 1The abbreviations DNA MeTaseDNA methyltransferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisAdoMetS- adenosylmethionine as a model DNA-binding protein.

For example, the intraperitoneal injection of antisense oligonucleotide to DNA MeTase mRNA into LAF/1 mice bearing tumors derived from the syngeneic tumor cell line Y1 (11Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R.

Uncovering the biological role of DNA MeTase in vivorequires the availability of specific DNA MeTase inhibitors especially since mice bearing a null mutation of the DNA MeTase die at midgestation (13Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar). The most established inhibitors of DNA MeTase are nucleoside analogs such as 5-fluorouracil and 5-azaCdR (14Jones P.A. Cell. 1985; 40: 485-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), which are believed to covalently trap the DNA MeTase after incorporation into DNA (15.Wu, J. C., and Santi, D. V. (1985) 198,119–129.Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that this mechanism of action is responsible for the cytotoxic and mutagenic side effects of 5-azaCdR (16Jackson-Grusby L. Laird P.W.

Cancer Metasasis Rev. 1998; 17: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One direct inhibitor of DNA MeTase isS-adenosylhomocysteine (19Chiang P.K. Burbelo P.D. Brugh S.A. Gordon R.K. Fukuda K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4988-4991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however,S-adenosylhomocysteine is not a specific inhibitor of DNA methylation and might inhibit other methylation reactions in the cell. We reasoned that oligonucleotide-based DNA analogs that bind the DNA MeTase but are not acceptors of the methyl group will form a high affinity stable intermediate with DNA MeTase and will be potent inhibitors of DNA MeTase. In this paper, we describe the design of self complementary oligonucleotides that form “hairpin” structures and demonstrate that a combination of modifications of the DNA sequence, methylation status, and phosphate backbone of these oligonucleotides results in modified substrates that act as potent and efficacious direct inhibitors of DNA MeTase. All oligonucleotides were synthesized at Hybridon Inc. using standard phosphoramidite chemistry as described previously, purified on a 20% denaturing PAGE, eluted by salt extraction, denatured by boiling, and reannealed by slow cooling to room temperature, and dissolved in water at a final concentration of 1 mm. A549 non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (ATCC, CCL 185) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with low glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. H446 lung carcinoma cells (ATCC, HTB 171) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% fetal calf serum. To treat A549 cells with hairpin oligonucleotides, cells were plated 18 h before treatment at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells per 10-cm plate. The relevant hairpin oligonucleotides were mixed with 30 μl of Lipofectin (2 mg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) and 4 ml of OPTI-MEM serum-free medium and left at room temperature for 15 min and then added to cells. The hairpin containing medium was removed from the cells and replaced with regular growth medium after 4 h. The treatment was repeated 3 times at 24-h intervals. The cells were split after the third treatment and equal numbers of cells were plated on 10-cm tissue culture plates and harvested after 24 h. DNA MeTase activity was assayed using nuclear extracts (5 μg of total protein) prepared from human lung carcinoma cell line H446 as described previously (20Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (final volume of 30 μl) included the indicated concentrations of oligonucleotides in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 25% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 μl ofS-[methyl-3H]adenosyl-l-methionine (78.9 Ci/mmol, Amersham) (AdoMet) as a methyl donor, and 0.2 μm of a synthetic hemimethylated double-stranded oligonucleotide substrate as a methyl acceptor as described previously (20Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following 2 h incubation at 37 °C the reaction was inactivated by heating at 65 °C for 5 min and the incorporation of methyl groups into the DNA substrate was determined by scintillation counting of trichloroacetic acid precipitable counts. For each experiment, the background counts reflecting methylation of other macromolecules present in the nuclear extract as well as endogenous DNA methylation were determined by incubating the nuclear extract under the same conditions in the absence of the hemimethylated substrate. In a typical experiment the background counts obtained with nuclear extract alone were around 3000 dpm. The background counts were subtracted from the values obtained per each point. The DNA methyltransferase reaction is linear for 3 h under these conditions. The results are presented as an average of three determinations and the apparent constant of inhibition was determined by curve fitting of the dose-response curve using Sigma Plot software. DNA MeTase was purified from A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultures at near confluence. Nuclei were isolated by resuspending and incubating the cells in buffer A (100 μl/107 cells: 10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmKCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 10 min, which was followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The nuclear pellet were resuspended in buffer A (400 μl) and collected as above. Nuclear proteins were extracted by resuspending and incubating the nuclear pellet in buffer B (30 μl/107 cells: 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.4 mm NaCl) at 4 °C for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min to separate the nuclear extract in the supernatant from the chromatin pellet. Nuclear extracts were stored at −80 °C. Freshly prepared nuclear extract was diluted to a conductivity equivalent to 0.2 mNaCl and applied onto a DEAE-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column (1.0 × 5 cm), which was pre-equilibrated with buffer P (10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) containing 0.2m NaCl. The column was operated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After sample loading, the column was washed with 15 ml of the starting buffer (buffer P + 0.2 m NaCl) and the proteins were eluted with 5 ml of a linear NaCl gradient (0.2–1.0 m). 0.5-ml fractions were collected and assayed for DNA MeTase activity as described above after desalting through a Microcon 10 (Amicon Inc.) spin column. DNA MeTase eluted between 0.3 and 0.5 m NaCl. The pooled active fractions were adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl by dilution and applied onto a Q-Sepharose column (1.0 × 5 cm), which had been previously equilibrated with buffer P at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed and eluted with a 5 ml of a linear NaCl gradient of 0.2–1.0 m. 0.5-ml fractions were collected and assayed for DNA MeTase activity after desalting and concentrating (to a final volume of 0.2 ml) through a Microcon 10 spin column. MeTase activity eluted between 0.3 and 0.4 m NaCl. The pooled active fractions were adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl, loaded onto a 2.0 × 2.0-cm DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia) column, and eluted with 10 ml of buffer P containing 0.2 m NaCl. The fractions (0.8 ml) were collected and assayed after concentration to about 200 μl, for MeTase activity. Activity was detected at fraction 4, which is very near the void volume (Table I). A silver staining PAGE analysis revealed one distinct band migrating around 200 kDa. DNA MeTase is an unstable protein in our hands which explains in part the loss of activity through the purification procedure (Table I). This loss of activity can explain why the fold purification as determined by enzymatic assays is only 240-fold whereas only a single distinct band is identified by a silver-stain PAGE analysis. The identity of the band as DNA MeTase was verified by a Western blot analysis of the purified fraction with a previously described anti DNA MeTase polyclonal antibody (11Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R.

Subdomains of the human DNA-cytosine-5-methyltransferase cDNA were generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from 1 μg of total RNA prepared from the human small lung carcinoma cell line H446 using the following set of primers: a, 5′-ccccatcggtttccgcgcgaaaa-3′(sense; 168–190) and 5′-gcatctgccattcccactct-3′ (antisense; 611–592); b, 5′-ttatccgaggagggctacct-3′ (sense; 454–473) and 5′-cccttccctttgtttccagggc-3′ (antisense; 3573–3551); c, 5′-ggcaagggaaaagggaaggg-3′ (sense; 3571–3590) and 5′-gtccttagcagcttcctcct-3′ (antisense; 5085–5066). The nucleotide positions are according to accession number X63692. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned in pCR3.1 vector (InVitrogen) and the sequence of the cDNAs was verified by dideoxy chain termination method using a T7 DNA sequencing kit (Pharmacia) and alignment to the published human DNA MeTase sequence (21Yen R.W. Vertino P.M. Nelkin B.D. Yu J.J. el-Deiry W. Cumaraswamy A. Lennon G.G. Trask B.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2287-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To generate the DNA MeTase construct we first cleaved the pCR 3.1 bearing fragment c withEcoRI, the fragment was blunted and ligated to a pCR3.1 vector bearing fragment b which was cleaved at the 3′ EcoRV site. This construct was then cleaved with XbaI and ligated it into a pCR3.1 vector bearing fragment a which was cleaved at an internal XbaI site to form the reassembled MeTase construct. This plasmid can direct expression from the bacteriophage T7 or the mammalian cytomegalovirus promoter. Escherichia coli BL21 DE 3 cells (expressing T7 polymerase under a Lac promoter) were transformed with plasmid pCR 3.1MeTase and grown in 2 liters of Luria broth medium at 37 °C up to an OD600 of 0.6. The cells were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside for 6 h. Following centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min, the cells (10 g) were suspended in 10 ml of Buffer P, sonicated for 5 min with a burst and a gap of 15 s. The supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min and was blended with the protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and Pefabloc SC (Boehringer-Mannheim) (10 μl each of 1 mg/ml stock solution) and loaded onto a 10-ml phosphocellulose column equilibrated with Buffer P + 0.2 m NaCl. Active fractions were identified by a DNA MeTase assay as described above and were pooled and further purified by Q-Sepharose and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography as described above for A459 human DNA MeTase. To identify DNA-protein complexes formed between DNA MeTase and the hairpin inhibitors, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed. The different oligonucleotides were labeled at their 5′ with32P by incubating 5 μm purified oligonucleotide with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boerhinger-Mannheim) in a final volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for 2 h. The labeled oligonucleotide was then purified on a 6% denaturing PAGE to remove the T4 polynucleotide kinase and the unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP, eluted from the gel, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in double-distilled water. This mixture was heated at 90 °C for 5 min and the hairpin was annealed by allowing the mixture to cool slowly to 25 °C. The DNA binding reactions contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7), 12% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm dithothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 μg of purified human MeTase, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 300 μm scrambled phosphorothioate oligonucleotide as a nonspecific competitor (5′-CGATTCAATCCTCACCTCTC), and the indicated concentration of hairpin oligonucleotide in a final reaction volume of 10 μl. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C for approximately 3 h at 220 volts. For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of the competing oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture prior to adding the labeled test hairpin inhibitor. For determination of apparent dissociation constants (K d), the level of complex formation at different substrate concentrations was quantified with a PhosphorImager and plotted against the substrate concentration. The K dwas calculated using the Sigma plot software. To determine the stability of the complex formed with the hemimethylated hairpin (k off), a binding reaction mixture of 100 μl was prepared with the same final concentrations described above. After an initial incubation time of 30 min, 100-fold excess of competitor was added (time 0) at room temperature and 10 μl of the binding reaction were removed at each time point and loaded on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Human DNA MeTase was synthesized by coupled transcription-translation, with the Promega TNT reticulocyte lysate kit, from 2 μg of human DNA MeTase cDNA cloned into pCR 3.1 using T7 RNA polymerase and 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol) in a 50-μl reaction volume in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin) were purchased from Dynal. The hemimethylated 5′-biotin phosphorothioate hairpin oligonucleotide had an identical sequence to oligo 3018 and was synthesized using phosphoramidite chemistry on a Biosearch model 8700 automated synthesizer and was purified by high performance liquid chromatography using a phenyl-Sepharose column followed by DEAE 5PW anion exchange chromatography. The oligonucleotide (at a final concentration of 3 μm) was incubated with 5 mg of beads in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl EDTA (pH 7.4) and 1 mNaCl for 10 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed and resuspended in 500 μl of the same buffer. The final concentration of the oligo bound to the beads was 150 pmol/mg and was calculated by measuring the optical density at 260 nm of the supernatant before and after binding of beads. To assay DNA MeTase binding to the hairpin bound beads, 50 μg of nuclear extract or 3 μl of in vitro translated DNA MeTase were preincubated in a 30-μl reaction mixture including nonspecific or specific competitor oligonucleotide (100 μm), 10 mm Tris-HCl EDTA (pH 7.4), protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, sodium vanadate, 10 μg), and 40 mm NaCl. At this point the mixture was applied onto 500 μg of hairpin bound beads for 5 min. The bound fraction and the unbound supernatant were separated by a magnet and the bound beads were washed twice with 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl EDTA (pH 7.4) buffer followed by two washes in a 1 m NaCl containing buffer. After washing, the bead bound fraction was resuspended in 30 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl EDTA (pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS solution and boiled for 5 min. The different fractions were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel, dried, and exposed to autoradiography. SK-Bluescript plasmid (50 ng, Stratagene) was denatured by boiling for 10 min in presence of a hexanucleotide mixture (Boehringer-Mannheim) in the presence of Boehringer primer extension buffer, and was then annealed with the random primers by slow cooling to room temperature. 0.25 μm dNTPs (−dCTP), 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products Inc.), 5 μg of H446 nuclear extract, and the indicated concentration of hairpin oligonucleotide or scrambled oligonucleotide were added to the reaction mixture to a final volume of 30 μl and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The incorporation of labeled dCTP into extended DNA was determined by scintillation counting of trichloroacetic acid precipitable counts. SK-Bluescript plasmid (1 μg, Stratagene) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 units of HpaII MeTase (New England Biolabs) and 80 mm S-adenosylmethionine, in the buffer recommended by the manufacturer, in the presence of the indicated concentrations of hairpin or scrambled oligonucleotide. The reaction was terminated and the enzyme was heat inactivated at 65 °C for 20 min. The methylated plasmid was subjected to digestion with 10 units ofHpaII restriction enzyme in 40 μl of the appropriate buffer for 30 min at 37 °C and the digestion products were analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel which was subjected to Southern blotting and hybridization with a 32P-labeled SK probe. Bisulfite mapping was performed as described previously (22Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The primers used for the HumanMyoD first exon (GenBank accession X56677) were: MyoD IN1′ 5′- GTTTTTTTTGTTTTTTTGTTATAA-3′ (position 173–195), MyoD OUT1′ 5′-TTGTTAGTATTTTGTTATTTATAG-3′ (position 8–21), MyoD IN2′ 5′-CTCAAAAACCTCATTTACTTT-3′ (position 506–483), MyoD OUT2′ 5′-CAAAATCTCCACCTTAAACA-3′ (position 569–549). Our general goal was to design a modified DNA MeTase substrate that will bind the DNA MeTase with higher affinity than the unmodified sequence, will not serve as a methyl acceptor in the reaction, but will occupy the enzyme. The following principles were used in our initial design of modified substrates. First, the preferable substrate for vertebrate DNA MeTase is a hemimethylated CpG dinucleotide contained in double-stranded DNA (23Gruenbaum Y. Cedar H. Razin A. Nature. 1982; 295: 620-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, it stands to reason that cointroduction in vivo of two annealed oligonucleotides without disturbing their interaction is an arduous task. There is documented evidence, however, that single-stranded oligonucleotides could be delivered ex vivo and in vivo (2Akhtar S. Agrawal S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 12-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We therefore opted at designing self-complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides that can form hairpin structures and enable the formation of a hemimethylated duplex (see TableII for prototype structures). A hemimethylated DNA duplex forms, however, only a low affinity complex with mammalian DNA MeTase (24Hanck T. Schmidt S. Fritz H.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Reale A. Lindsay H. Saluz H.P. Pradhan S. Adams R.L.P. Jost J.-P. Storm R. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It is therefore clear that certain modifications will be required to generate a potent inhibitor of DNA MeTase. Altering the recognition sequence in the hemimethylated CpG dinucleotide pair can significantly alter the affinity of the enzyme to the substrate and the rate of methylation (26Smith S.S. Kan J.L.C. Baker D.J. Kaplan B.E. Dembek P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that structures associated with more weakly stacked cytosine rings, such as mispaired or abasic duplexes and other unusual DNA structures, are preferentially methylated by the human DNA MeTase (26Smith S.S. Kan J.L.C. Baker D.J. Kaplan B.E. Dembek P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,27Smith S.S. Lingeman R.G. Kaplan B.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Table IIModifications of the phosphate backbone determine the potency of hairpin inhibitors of DNA MeTase Open table in a new tab We designed our hairpins to recapitulate the natural substrate. The 5′ arm of the hairpin bearing methylated CpGs mimics the parental methylation guiding strand whereas the 3′ arm of the hairpin mimics the nascent methyl-acceptor strand of replicating DNA (Table II). As our goal was to design an inhibitor of DNA MeTase, we tested the hypothesis that introducing changes similar to those previously described (26Smith S.S. Kan J.L.C. Baker D.J. Kaplan B.E. Dembek P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Smith S.S. Lingeman R.G. Kaplan B.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to the methyl acceptor strand will increase the time of occupancy of the enzyme by the substrate as well as inhibit methyl transfer. In addition, very little is known about the interactions of the DNA MeTase and the phosphate and sugar components of the backbone. We reasoned that these interactions might be critical in determining the ability of the enzyme to interact with the substrate as well as its ability to catalyze the methyl transfer. Based on these principles, a set of single-stranded oligonucleotides to act as substrates for DNA MeTase were synthesized (Tables II and III). Both hemimethylated and nonmethylated variants were synthesized as well as various substitutions to the C located opposite the methylated CpG dinucleotide. The two CpG sites in each oligonucleotide were separated by 4 bases to avoid tandem CpGs which were previously shown to be poor substrates of DNA MeTase (28Bolden A.H. Nalin C.M. Ward C.A. Poonian M.S. Weissbach A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1135-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All compounds are expected to form a hairpin structure based on previously documented published data and theoretical considerations (29Boulard Y. Gabarro-Arpa J. Cognet J.A. LeBret M. Guy A.

We have verified that these oligonucleotides form double-stranded structures at 37 °C (data not shown). The potency of the oligonucleotides as inhibitors of DNA MeTase was determined by measuring the rate of DNA MeTase-catalyzed transfer of a tritiated methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to a standard hemimethylated double-stranded oligonucleotide substrate (20Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a nuclear extract prepared from a human small cell lung carcinoma line H446 in the presence of increasing concentrations of these oligonucleotides. Typical curves are presented in Fig.1. The ability of the inhibitors to serve as acceptors of DNA MeTase-catalyzed transfer of methyl groups in the absence of the standard substrate was determined using saturating concentrations of the inhibitors (1 μm).

We describe herein the characterization of a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes antithrombin in complex with either thrombin, factor Xa, or a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues P14 to P9 of the serpin's reactive center loop (RCL, ultimately cleaved between the P1 and P′1 residues). Accordingly, this antibody reacts with none of the monomeric conformers of antithrombin (native, latent, and RCL-cleaved) and does not recognize heparin-activated antithrombin or antithrombin bound to a non-catalytic mutant of thrombin (S195A, in which the serine of the charge stabilizing system has been swapped for alanine). The neoepitope encompasses the motif DAFHK, located in native antithrombin on strand 4 of β-sheet A, which becomes strand 5 of β-sheet A in the RCL-cleaved and latent conformers. The inferences on the structure of the antithrombin-protease stable complex are that either a major remodeling of antithrombin accompanies the final elaboration of the complex or that, within the complex, at the most residues P14 to P6 of the RCL are inserted into β-sheet A. These conclusions limit drastically the possible locations of the defeated protease within the complex.

The RCL connects strand 4 of β-sheet A to strand 1 of β-sheet C; it is exposed to solvent in the inhibitory serpins. By analogy with protease substrates, the 20 amino acids constituting the RCL are numbered Pn- … -P1-P′1- … -P′n, where P1-P′1 is ultimately cleaved. The mechanism of protease inhibition involves multiple steps that initiate by the formation of a reversible association, converting to a stable complex, ultimately split into regenerated enzyme and RCL-cleaved (consumed) serpin (9Patston P.A.

Based on functional studies of serpin variants and immunochemical investigations, a number of reports nevertheless suggest that, in the stable complex, the RCL is inserted into β-sheet A. Antibodies have been characterized that fail to react with native serpin, but recognize binary complexes with a synthetic tetradecapeptide corresponding to residues P14 to P1 of the RCL, as well as consumed inhibitors (27Skriver K.

Thus, antibodies revealed that insertion of the RCL in β-sheet A exposes neoepitopes that are not present in the intact inhibitor. The same neoepitopes being exposed in stable serpin-protease complexes led to the conclusion that, during trapping of the protease, the RCL inserts at least in part into β-sheet A. Convincing evidence also suggests that the protease translocates away from the site at which initial attack occurs. Wright and Scarsdale (34Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) even proposed that the enzyme ends in a location almost opposite to that of the RCL in intact serpins, i.e. that, in the stable serpin-protease complexes, β-sheet A is a six-stranded sheet. Stratikos and Gettins (35Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, at least 21 Å separates position of the protease in the initial (reversible) Michaelis complex from that in the (virtually irreversible) final complex. Modeling considerations suggest a range of plausible stable structures: from full insertion of the RCL with upside-down translocation of the defeated protease, to limited RCL insertion (up to the P9residue) with concomitant stacking of the target on the F-helix. Following cross linking experiments with stable complexes of type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor, Wilczynska et al. (36Wilczynska M. Fa M. Karolin J. Ohlsson P.-I. Johansson L.B.-Å. Ny T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) favored stacking on the F-helix, and partial rather than complete insertion of the cleaved RCL. We report herein characterization of a monoclonal antibody (12A5) that provides definite insight into the structure of the stable AT-protease complex; unless AT was unfolded, the antibody failed to react with any AT monomers, while endorsing stable complexes with thrombin or factor Xa and binary complex with a short peptide derived from the RCL. The unexpected location of the neoepitope, on the distal part of β-sheet A, has several fundamental implications. The conformations of β-sheet A and/or of the F-helix in the stable complex must simultaneously differ from the five- and six-stranded structures of native and RCL-cleaved AT, respectively. Steric hindrance considerations also limit drastically the possible topologies of the complex. Human thrombin and its S195A variant were prepared as described previously (8Stone S.R. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 344-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Factor Xa was purchased from ERL (South Bend, IL). Porcine pancreatic elastase (type IV) and bovine serum albumin (BSA, protease-free) were from Sigma (St-Quentin Fallavier, France), as well as mouse AT and bovine, sheep, porcine, rabbit, and chicken plasma. Standard, unfractionated heparin (Heparin Choay) and pentasaccharide with high affinity for AT (M, 1714) were from Sanofi-Winthrop (Gentilly, France). Peptide P14-P9 derived from the RCL of AT (Ac-SEAAAS) was synthesized by Altergen (Schiltigheim, France). Human AT was purified from citrated frozen plasma essentially according to McKay (37McKay E.J. Thromb. Res. 1981; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia, St-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France), followed by anion-exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q column (Pharmacia). AT cleaved by porcine pancreatic elastase was prepared by incubating AT (5 μm) with 50 nm enzyme for 4 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 0.15m NaCl and 0.1% polyethylene glycol (M r 8000; w/v). The resulting C-terminal fragment was isolated by transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% acrylamide), and analyzed by N-terminal sequencing (Biotechnology Department, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Two sites of cleavage were identified: Val389-Ile390 and Ile390-Ala391, corresponding to the P5-P4 and P4-P3residues of the RCL, respectively. Identical cleavages are obtained following incubation of AT with human neutrophil elastase (38Gettins P. Harten B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3634-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thrombin-cleaved AT was prepared by incubating AT (7 μm) with thrombin (0.1 μm) for 3 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl and trace amounts of SDS (0.02%, w/v; Refs. 39Urano T. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B.-Å. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and 40Munch M. Heegaard C.W. Andreasen P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thrombin was neutralized by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Traces of SDS and excess phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were removed by extensive dialysis against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) suggested that in these conditions AT was fully cleaved by thrombin, at a single site. In addition to the N terminus of AT, N-terminal sequencing of the reaction mixture revealed a single sequence starting with the P′1residue of the RCL, indicating that thrombin cleaved a single bond in AT, between the P1 and P′1 residues of the RCL. AT cleaved by porcine pancreatic elastase or by thrombin were indistinguishable by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig.1) and had a similar affinity for heparin (i.e. reduced compared with native AT); both eluted at about 0.3 m NaCl on heparin-Sepharose column. Latent AT was prepared according to Wardell et al. (41Wardell M.R. Chang W.-S.W. Bruce D. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, AT (1.7 μm) was incubated for 18 h at 60 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.35 m sodium citrate. Following incubation, the mixture was dialyzed against 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and latent AT was recovered by heparin-Sepharose chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q column, both developed with a linear gradient from 0.0 to 0.5 m NaCl; latent AT eluted at 0.3 and 0.2 m NaCl, respectively. The concentration of all AT monomers was estimated assuming an absorption coefficient of 3.8 × 104m−1cm−1 at 280 nm (ε%=6.5 cm−1). Stable complexes of AT with thrombin or factor Xa were prepared by incubating AT (5 μm) for 2 h at room temperature with thrombin (5 μm) or for 4 h with factor Xa (5 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.1% polyethylene glycol (M r 8000; w/v). Virtually no monomer of AT (either native or RCL-cleaved) could be seen by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in the presence of SDS (Fig. 1); therefore, concentrations of the complexes were assumed to be that of the added AT (5 μm). Reversible complex of AT with S195A thrombin was prepared by mixing AT (2 μm) with S195A thrombin (2 μm) in the presence of heparin (1 unit/ml); association was presumed to be almost instantaneous (8Stone S.R. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 344-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and concentration of the reversible complex was assumed to be that of the added AT. Formation of a binary complex with the P14-P9 peptide derived from the RCL was carried out according to Schulze et al. (28Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.-B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and Chang et al. (42Chang W.-S.W. Whisstock J. Hopkins P.C.R. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), by incubation of AT (20 μm) and peptide (2 mm) in 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm NaCl. Binary complex was used immediately after a 60-min incubation at 37 °C: when less than 50% AT formed a complex and no polymerization of AT had yet occurred (Fig. 1). Concentration of the binary complex was assumed to be 40% that of the total amount of AT. Murine monoclonal antibodies directed against human AT were selected, isolated and characterized by standard procedures (43Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, NY1988: 139-282Google Scholar). Four 6-week-old BALB/c females were immunized by subcutaneous injection of 20 μg of AT in complete Freund's adjuvant followed 3 weeks later by a further subcutaneous injection of 20 μg of AT in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. One hundred days later, mouse received 8 μg of AT subcutaneously and 12 μg of AT intravenously. One day prior to the AT injection, and for 5 days, mice also received a daily intraperitoneal injection of 20 μg of pentasaccharide. Three days after the final injection, spleen cells were fused with the mouse myeloma cell line P3-X63-Ag.8.653 by using 50% polyethylene glycol 1540, and cultured in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine media. Positive clones were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); Maxisorp microplates from Nunc (Polylabo, Strasbourg, France) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg/ml AT in 0.1 mNa2HCO3/NaH2CO3, pH 9.5, and washed three times in 20 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl (PBS) and 0.5% Tween 20 (v/v). Residual sites were blocked for 1 h with 1 mg/ml BSA in PBS, and microplates were washed as above. Each hybridoma supernatant to be tested was added to one of the wells of the microplate and allowed to bind for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad, Ivry-sur-Seine, France) was added and allowed to bind for 1 h at room temperature. Following a final wash, ELISA was developed by adding 150 μl of orthophenylenediamine (0.5 mg/ml; Bio-Rad) in 0.1m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, containing 0.3% H2O2 (v/v). The reaction was stopped after 30 min by the addition of 50 μl of H2SO4(12.5%, v/v), and the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded. Selected clones were grown in pristane-primed BALB/c mice, and antibodies purified from the ascitic fluid by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia). IgG appeared pure by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and were stored at −80 °C after dialysis against PBS. The subclass was determined with a commercial kit (Amersham, Les Ulis, France): monoclonal 12A5 described in this study was typed as IgG2a. To identify the conformers of AT recognized by the monoclonal antibodies, a sandwich ELISA was designed in which microplates were coated with purified IgG (5 μg/ml). Each AT conformer, diluted in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (v/v) and 1 mg/ml BSA, was added to one of the wells of the microplate and allowed to bind for 2 h at room temperature. Sandwich ELISA was developed with a peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG directed against human AT (Sanofi Research, Montpellier, France). In assays with S195A-AT reversible complexes, 1 unit/ml heparin was present during the binding step, and all buffers included 0.1 unit/ml heparin to prevent release throughout the washing steps. Ability of the S195A-AT complexes to be retained on a microtiter plate was assessed by the use of a commercial kit designed to detect plasma thrombin-AT complexes (Enzygnost TAT micro; Behring, Marburg, Germany). A microplate, coated with a polyclonal antibody directed against thrombin was incubated with various amounts of S195A-AT complexes and developed with a polyclonal antibody directed against AT, according to the manufacturer's instructions except that 0.1 unit/ml heparin was added in all buffers. Customized AT peptide sets were prepared by Chiron Mimotopes Peptide Systems (Clayton, Victoria, Australia) as biotinylated peptides linked to a cleavable polyethylene pin (44Geysen H.M. Rodda S.J. Mason T.J. Tribbick G. Schoofs P.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 102: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). A four-amino acid spacer (GSGS) separated the N terminus of each peptide from the pin, except for the peptide encompassing the first 14 amino acids of AT where the spacer was coupled to the C terminus. Binding assays were performed according to the supplier's instructions. Briefly, 100 μl of streptavidin (5 μg/ml in water) was added to each well of a microplate and evaporated to dryness at 37 °C. Biotinylated peptides (about 1 μm in PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Monoclonal antibody (0.1 μg/ml) in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (v/v) and 1 mg/ml BSA was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Washing and development were otherwise performed as described above for the ELISA, using the peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Immunoblotting of the various AT conformers (after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in denaturing conditions) was performed on nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) essentially as described previously (45Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Bock S.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8433-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Incubation and washing were all completed at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.15m NaCl and 0.5% Tween 20 (v/v). The membrane was saturated with nonfat dry milk (3% w/v), washed, and incubated for 1 h with monoclonal antibody 12A5 (0.5 μg/ml). After washing, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). The immunoblot was further washed, and developed by adding a phosphatase substrate solution consisting of 0.15 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 0.3 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium in 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.5, containing 0.5 mm MgCl2. The influence of monoclonal antibody 12A5 on thrombin and factor Xa inhibition by AT was studied in the absence and in the presence of heparin, essentially as described previously (46Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12241-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 47Djie M.Z. Le Bonniec B.F. Hopkins P.C.R. Hipler K. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11461-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol (M r 8000; w/v); 1 mg/ml BSA was included in the assay of factor Xa inhibition. Without heparin, estimates of the association rate constant (k on), in the presence of 1 μm12A5 (or control IgG), were obtained from kinetic experiments performed in microplates, under pseudo first-order conditions (20–100 nm AT with 2 nm thrombin, and 150–300 nm AT with 15 nm factor Xa). First order rate constants were estimated by non-linear regression analysis of the residual activities versus time (up to 90 min), andk on values deduced from the linear plot of the first order rate constants as a function of AT. Thek on values in presence of heparin (1.4 units/ml), were estimated by analysis of data from progress-curve kinetics also completed in pseudo first-order conditions (0.2–0.6 nm AT with 10 pm thrombin, and 1–2 nm AT with 100 pm factor Xa). Inhibition of thrombin was initiated by its addition to a microtiter well containing 0.2 μm 12A5 (or control IgG), AT at various concentration, and 100 μmH-d-Phe-pipecolyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2238, Biogenic, Montpellier, France). Before initiating factor Xa inhibition, the release of p-nitroaniline from 400 μmbenzyl-CO-Ile-Glu-(γ-OR)-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2222, Biogenic) by factor Xa was monitored for 10–15 min, until a steady state velocity of about 0.2 μm min−1 was reached. The inhibition reaction was initiated by the addition of a mixture of 0.2 μm 12A5 (or control IgG) and AT at various concentrations. The release of p-nitroaniline was monitored for up to 3 h using a Lambda 14 Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer, but only data corresponding to less than 10% substrate hydrolysis were used in the analysis. Estimates of the k onvalues were obtained by fitting data to the equation for slow-binding inhibition and corrected for the competition introduced by the substrate. AT may adopt at least four conformations: native, heparin-activated, latent, and RCL-cleaved. A fifth conformation is likely to occur when AT is trapped in a complex with one of its targets (thrombin or factor Xa), but the precise structure of AT within this complex remains largely unknown. In an attempt to probe the elusive conformation of trapped AT, we prepared a panel of monoclonal antibodies; 12 were selected, because they recognized AT that had been coated on a microplate. To determine which conformer of AT was recognized, the monoclonal antibodies were coated onto a microplate, then AT (native, RCL-cleaved, or in complex with thrombin) was added, and sandwich ELISA developed with a polyclonal antibody directed against AT. Two monoclonal antibodies retained our attention, because they did not react with native or RCL-cleaved AT, while giving a strong signal with complexes; the other monoclonal antibodies reacted with all three forms of AT, indicating that selectivity of the former was not due to an experimental artifact. Thus, even though AT-protease complexes were not included in the immunization mixture, all the antibodies reacted with AT in complex. Although surprising at first, we reasoned that complexes might have formed with endogenous mouse proteases, and that a neoepitope inaccessible in the native protein might be exposed in partially denatured AT. To delineate more precisely the specificity of one of the monoclonal antibodies (12A5), we evaluated its affinities for native, latent, and heparin-activated AT, for AT with the RCL cleaved by thrombin or porcine pancreatic elastase, for AT in stable complex with thrombin or factor Xa, and for AT in complex with a peptide derived from the P14-P9 residues of its RCL. AT in complex with either thrombin or factor Xa bound to 12A5 in a dose-dependent fashion, as did the binary complex of AT with the P14-P9 peptide, although to a lesser extent, but binding of the other AT conformers remained undetected at concentrations as high as 1 μm (Fig.2). In contrast, 12A5 recognized all forms of AT following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS and immunoblotting, even after reduction of the disulfide bridges with β-mercaptoethanol. Thus, a motif recognized by 12A5, inaccessible in native, heparin-activated, latent, and RCL-cleaved AT, was exposed in denatured and target-complexed AT. Taken together, these data suggested that steric hindrance, rather than a need for a specific conformation, limited the ability of 12A5 to interact with native or RCL-cleaved AT. As 12A5 recognized unfolded AT after reduction of the disulfide bonds, it was reasonable to expect that the neoepitope was a contiguous sequence of amino acids. We scanned two sets of biotinylated peptides, covering the entire sequence of AT. The first set simply divided AT sequence into 31 peptides that each were 14 amino acids in length, starting with His1 of AT; the second set divided AT sequence into 30 peptides (each also 14 amino acids in length) but starting with Cys8 of AT. Thus, each peptide overlapped 2 peptides of the alternate set by 7 amino acids (except peptides 1 and 31 of the first set). Peptides were individually linked to the well of a microtitration plate, and incubated with 12A5. ELISA was developed with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. Only two peptides of the whole bank were able to bind 12A5: GRDDLYVSDAFHKA and SDAFHKAFLEVNEE, suggesting that the neoepitope included the shared motif SDAFHKA. Consistent with this hypothesis, 0.5 μmthrombin-AT displaced 50% of the binding of 10 nm 12A5 to peptide SDAFHKA coated on a microplate. Similarly, 0.2 μmpeptide SDAFHK displaced 50% of the binding of 2 nmthrombin-AT to 12A5 c"
https://openalex.org/W2069956333,"In a previous study we observed that long term (5 days) incubation with fumonisin B1 (FB1), an inhibitor of acylation of sphingoid long chain bases to (dihydro)ceramide, resulted in morphological and biochemical changes in 3T3 fibroblasts (Meivar-Levy, I., Sabanay, H., Bershadsky, A. D., and Futerman, A. H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 1558–1564). Among these were changes in the profile of synthesis of sphingolipids (SLs) and glycosphingolipids (GSLs). Whereas [3H]globotriaosylceramide ([3H]Gb3) comprised 1.9% of the total [3H]SLs and [3H]GSLs synthesized in control cells, it comprised 16.5% in FB1-treated cells. We now demonstrate by in vitro analysis that inhibition of ceramide synthesis by FB1 for 5 days results in up-regulation of the activities of three enzymes in the pathway of Gb3 synthesis, namely glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and Gb3 synthases; up-regulation is due to an increase inV max, with no change in K mvalues toward lipid substrates. Moreover, molecular analysis (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) of glucosylceramide synthase indicated that this enzyme is up-regulated at the transcriptional level. No changes in either the V max orK m values of sphingomyelin or of GM3synthase were detected after FB1 treatment. Analysis of SL and GSL synthesis in cultured cells using [4,5-3H]sphinganine as a metabolic precursor demonstrated that at low substrate concentrations, Gb3 synthesis is favored over GM3 synthesis and glucosylceramide synthesis is favored over sphingomyelin synthesis, whereas the opposite is true at high substrate concentrations. These data demonstrate that GSL synthesis and in particular Gb3 synthesis are tightly regulated in fibroblasts, presumably so as to maintain constant levels of Gb3 on the cell surface. In a previous study we observed that long term (5 days) incubation with fumonisin B1 (FB1), an inhibitor of acylation of sphingoid long chain bases to (dihydro)ceramide, resulted in morphological and biochemical changes in 3T3 fibroblasts (Meivar-Levy, I., Sabanay, H., Bershadsky, A.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Significant variation exists in the types and levels of both acidic and neutral GSLs between different cells, and although most attention has been paid to the sialic-acidic containing GSLs, the gangliosides (2Ledeen R.W. Yu G. Trends. Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1992; 4: 174-187Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), neutral GSLs are also found at relatively high levels in a number of tissues (1Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar, 3Hakomori S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 453-459Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Among these is globotriaosylceramide (Galα1–4Galβ1–4Glcβ1-ceramide; Gb3). Gb3 is expressed in many types of human blood cells, including erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets, and its expression is elevated in some lymphomas (4Stults C.M. Larsen R.D. Marcher B.A. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 680-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 5Wiels J. Holmes E.H. Cochran N. Tursz T. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14783-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequential changes in the expression of Gb3 and of other GSLs occurs during B cell differentiation due to sequential activation of the corresponding glycosyltransferases (6Taga S. Tetaud C. Mangeney M. Tursz T. Wiels J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). No single function has been ascribed to Gb3, although it has been implicated as a differentiation antigen for B lymphocytes, as the Pk blood group antigen (7Naiki M. Marcus D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and as a marker for apoptosis of germinal center B-cells (8Mangeney M. Lingwood C.A. Taga S. Cailluo B. Tursz T. Weils J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5314-5319PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, although not a physiological function, Gb3 acts as the cell surface receptor for Shiga toxin (9Lindberg A.A. Brown J.E.

Liotta D.C. Riley R. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 218-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), levels of Gb3synthesis were not reduced (13Meivar-Levy I. Sabanay H. Bershadsky A.D. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1558-1564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of 3T3 fibroblasts for 5 days with 20 μm FB1, the incorporation of [4,5-3H]sphinganine (a precursor of the synthesis of all SLs and GSLs (14Hirschberg K. Zisling R. van Echten-Deckert G. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14876-14882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)) into [3H]SLs was reduced by ∼70% (13Meivar-Levy I. Sabanay H. Bershadsky A.D. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1558-1564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, whereas [3H]sphingomyelin (SM) and total [3H]GSL synthesis decreased by 75 and 72%, respectively, [3H]Gb3 synthesis unexpectedly increased after FB1 treatment by ∼2.3-fold. This resulted in different profiles of [3H]SL synthesis, with [3H]Gb3 comprising 1.9% of the total [3H]SLs synthesized in control cells but 16.5% in FB1-treated cells (13Meivar-Levy I. Sabanay H. Bershadsky A.D. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1558-1564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In the current study, we examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the differences in profiles of SL and GSL synthesis after long term inhibition of ceramide synthesis by FB1. By in vitro analyses, we demonstrate that three glycosyltransferases in the metabolic pathway leading to Gb3 synthesis are up-regulated. In addition, in vivo analysis demonstrates that differences in K m values also result in a preference for Gb3 synthesis when ceramide is synthesized at low levels. That fibroblasts specifically maintain cellular Gb3 levels, in preference over other GSLs and SLs, adds weight to the idea that Gb3 plays one or more essential, although as yet unidentified, physiological functions in fibroblasts and presumably in other cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsFB1 was from the Division of Food Science and Technology (CSIR, Pretoria, South Africa). d-Sphinganine and lactosylceramide (LacCer) were from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA).n-Hexanoic acid [1-14C]n-hydroxysuccinimide ester (55 mCi/mmol) was from American Radioactive Chemicals (St. Louis, MO).

After 24 h of incubation with [4,5-3H]sphinganine, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, removed by scraping with a rubber policeman, and centrifuged (15,000 ×g av, 30 min, 4 °C). Protein was determined (18Bradford M.M. Anal.

Upon metabolism of [4,5-3H]dihydroceramide to [3H]ceramide, we assume that 50% of the3H radioactivity is lost due to dehydrogenation of the 4,5-double bond; this was taken into account when quantifying [3H]GSL synthesis as described previously (14Hirschberg K.

Using [4,5-3H]sphinganine as a precursor of SL and GSL synthesis, we previously observed that residual levels of synthesis of each lipid differed after 5 days incubation with FB1 (20 μm) (13Meivar-Levy I.

No differences in residual levels of SL or GSL synthesis were observed after incubation with FB1 for short times (i.e. 1 h). 3I. Meivar-Levy and A. H. Futerman, unpublished observations. We have now systematically determined the activity of the five enzymes responsible for the synthesis of each lipid by in vitro analyses and analyzed whether differences in K m values between the different enzymes might account for the change in the profile of SL and GSL synthesis.In Vitro Analysis of SL SynthesisCultured fibroblasts were incubated with FB1 (20 μm) for various times, removed from the culture dishes, and homogenized, and SM and GlcCer synthases were assayed in vitro using a short acyl chain radioactive analogue of ceramide, [14C]hexanoyl Cer (15Futerman A.H.

After 3 h of incubation of fibroblasts with FB1, there was no difference in the activity of GlcCer synthase compared with control cells, but after 1 day, a 30% increase was detected (Fig. 1). As time of incubation with FB1 increased, the activity of GlcCer synthase increased to a maximum of ∼3-fold higher in cells incubated with FB1 for 5 days compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1). Addition of FB1 had no effect on GlcCer synthase activity or on the activity of any of the other enzymes assayed below, when added directly to the reaction mixture. The activity of SM synthase was much lower than GlcCer synthase in vitro, and no change in the level of SM synthase was detected even after 5 days of incubation with FB1 (Fig. 1).To determine whether the increase in activity of GlcCer synthase was due to changes in the V max or in theK m of the reaction, assays were performed using conditions in which the initial reaction rate (V o) was linear with respect to time and to protein concentration and was not limited by substrate availability. After 5 days incubation with FB1, theV max of GlcCer synthase was 333 pmol/min/mg of protein, compared with 167 pmol/min/mg of protein in control cells (Fig. 2), but the K mvalues with respect to [14C]hexanoyl Cer were unchanged (6.3 μm in FB1-treated cells and 6.5 μm in control cells (Fig. 2)). No change was detected in either the V max or K m value of SM synthase after 5 days of incubation with FB1 (not shown).Figure 2Kinetic analysis of GlcCer synthase activity.

RT-PCR analysis revealed that GlcCer synthase mRNA expression was increased in cells incubated with FB1 for 3 (not shown) or 5 days (Fig.3) but not for 3 h (not shown). This demonstrates that GlcCer synthase is up-regulated at the transcriptional level upon long term incubation with FB1.Figure 3RT-PCR analysis of GlcCer synthase.

Oligonucleotide markers (400–700 base pairs) are shown in the left-hand lane. Note that RT-PCR analysis was repeated three times, and in every case, more RNA expression was observed in FB1-treated than in control cells, although the extent of the increase differed between individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next examined the activity of LacCer synthase using [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer as substrate. TheV max of LacCer synthase also increased upon incubation with FB1 for 5 days, from 143 fmol/min/mg of protein in control cells to 250 fmol/min/mg of protein in FB1-treated cells (Fig. 4). The K m values with respect to [14C]hexanoyl GlcCer were unchanged (1.25 μm in FB1-treated cells and 1.57 μm in control cells (Fig. 4)). Similarly, the activity of Gb3 synthase was 2.7-fold higher in FB1-treatedversus control cells (Fig.5), 4Assays for Gb3 synthesis were not performed at saturating levels of UDP[14C]Gal because the low specific activity of this enzyme precluded detection of activity when UDP[14C]Gal was diluted with UDP-Gal. but in contrast, there was no increase in theV max of GM3 synthase after FB1 treatment for 5 days (Fig.6), although a small but statistically insignificant reduction in the activity of GM3 synthase was observed after FB1 treatment.Figure 4Kinetic analysis of LacCer synthase activity.

Liotta D.C. Riley R. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 218-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Incubation of cultured cells directly with sphinganine (10 μm added each day for 5 days) had no effect on enzyme activity measured in vitro (GlcCer, SM, and LacCer synthases), and co-incubation of FB1 together with sphinganine (10 μm added each day for 5 days) did not change the extent of enzyme up-regulation induced by FB1 (not shown). These results suggest that the effects observed are due to inhibition of ceramide synthesis rather than accumulation of sphinganine.In Vivo Analysis of [3H]GSL and [3H]SM SynthesisThe data presented above demonstrate that long term inhibition (5 days) of ceramide synthesis results in up-regulation of the activity of three glycosyltransferases that use ceramide or downstream metabolites of ceramide as substrate, GlcCer, LacCer, and Gb3 synthases, but does not affect SM or GM3synthases. We next examined whether flux to different branches of the SL and GSL synthesis pathway (see Fig. 8) is correlated with substrate levels by directly incubating cultured cells with varying amounts of [4,5-3H]sphinganine, a metabolic precursor of the five lipids analyzed above.Figure 8Proposed regulation of GSL and SM synthesis in 3T3 fibroblasts. When ceramide is synthesized at low levels, GlcCer synthesis (bold line) is favored over SM synthesis (dashed line), and Gb3 synthesis (bold line) is favored over GM3 synthesis (dashed line).

Because [3H]GM3 comprised ∼25% of total [3H]SLs and [3H]GSLs synthesized at both high and low [4,5-3H]sphinganine concentrations (TableI), the ratio of [3H]Gb3 to [3H]GM3 synthesis increased ∼4-fold as [4,5-3H]sphinganine decreased (Fig.7 A). In addition, whereas [3H]SM comprised 59% of the total [3H]SLs synthesized at 30 nm [4,5-3H]sphinganine, it comprised only 43% at 0.6 nm[4,5-3H]sphinganine (Table I), and as a result the ratio of [3H]GSLs to [3H]SM synthesis increased by ∼2-fold as [4,5-3H]sphinganine decreased (Fig.7 B).

https://openalex.org/W2091114195,"The in vitro folding ofEscherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (AP) from the guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) denatured state is characterized by a significant slow phase in the post activational recovery of native protein lability (probed by the susceptibility to GdnHCl denaturation and occurring on the time scale of days) as well as a slow phase in the recovery of activity (on the time scale of minutes). Slow folding events have often been attributed to cis-trans isomerizations ofX-Pro peptide bonds, a plausible explanation for AP, which contains 21 prolines per subunit. To investigate the role of proline isomerization in the two measures of refolding mentioned above, we have performed “double-jump” GdnHCl denaturation/renaturation experiments, with a third jump, where the rate of unfolding of refolded protein upon exposure to denaturant was added to assess the rate of change of lability. Our measurements of the time evolution of both the lability and the reactivation of refolded AP as a function of denaturation time show that proline isomerization is unlikely to be the cause of either of these slow events in the refolding of AP. The conclusions are further confirmed by the absence of proline isomerization effects when AP is refolded in the presence of human and periplasmic E. coli peptidyl-prolyl isomerase.

Numerous studies of protein folding have shown that kinetic trapping can produce folded forms of the protein that differ from the native state and may in fact lead to long time scale changes in structure. The molecular origin of this behavior and the nature of the trapped state are unclear and of considerable interest in studies of folding. For example, in vitro refolded β-lactoglobulin adopts a non-native conformation, as shown both by antibody binding (1Hattori M. Ametani A. Katakura Y. Shimizu M. Kaminogawa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22414-22419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by room temperature phosphorescence and lability (susceptibility to GdnHCl 1The abbreviations GdnHClguanidine hydrochlorideAPalkaline phosphatasePPIpeptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase denaturation) studies (2Subramaniam V. Steel D. Gafni A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2089-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). α-Lytic protease and subtilisin both require propeptides as intramolecular chaperones for successful folding, and the folding of either protein without the propeptide results in a stable molten globule structure that can convert to the native conformation only with the addition of the propeptide region in trans (3Baker D. Agard D.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7505-7509Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 4Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). If subtilisin is folded with a mutated propeptide, it adopts a distinctly altered conformation (4Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In these cases, the protein structure appears to be confined indefinitely in a near-native state. However, in other cases slow structural changes toward the native state have been observed. For example, in vivo newly synthesized phosphoglycerate kinase adopts a conformation that is slowly converted to a more stable state over time (5Hiremath L.S. Rothstein M. J. Gerontol. 1982; 37: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 6Rothstein M. Rothstein M. Review of Biological Research in Aging 2. Alan R. Liss Inc., New York1985: 421-433Google Scholar). When the “old” (stable) form is unfolded in vitro, it adopts the “young” conformation upon initial refolding and then spontaneously recovers the old state (7Yuh K. Gafni A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7458-7462Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Zúñiga A. Gafni A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 955: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The difference between stable, non-native state, kinetic trapping and slow conformational shifting toward the native state is likely due to the height of the activation energy barrier directly between the states, with a high barrier rendering the native state conformationally inaccessible on biologically relevant time scales. guanidine hydrochloride alkaline phosphatase peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase Of particular interest to this paper is the recent report of structural “annealing” in alkaline phosphatase (AP) (9Subramaniam V. Bergenhem N. Gafni A. Steel D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) where, as we discuss below, refolding from the extensively denatured state leads to unusually slow postactivational conformational changes reflecting a change in core rigidity and protein lability. This slow annealing behavior raises questions regarding the non-equivalence of the native and active states of AP. The native state represents the final pathway destination of the faster forming pre-annealed active-intermediate state or ensemble of states. The exact structural differences between the native and active states, and the molecular mechanism underlying these slow conformational changes remain unknown as does the relevance of this process to AP folding in vivo. Slow events that take place during protein folding have often been attributed to cis-trans isomerization of X-Pro peptide bonds (10Cook K.H. Schmid F.X. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancedda F. Ericsson L.H. Neumann P.A. Piccoli S.P. Schlesinger M.J. Shriefer K. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Upon unfolding of a proline-containing protein, the prolines equilibrate with a fraction of the denatured protein containing non-native cis/trans configurations. Refolding of the protein may then result in trapping of the non-native configurations which, depending on the activation energy for isomerization, may then evolve in time to the lower energy native state. In the case of AP, measurements of the refolding kinetics show the existence of a slow phase in the recovery of lability, itself a measure of the activation energy to unfolding, on a time scale of days following the recovery of biological activity. This slow change in lability is accompanied by a slow change in the state of the core of the protein as inferred by a corresponding change in room temperature phosphorescence. Interestingly, the biological activity, which recovers relatively quickly, is also characterized by a slow phase on the order of minutes. Proline isomerization time scales within a folded protein are typically on the order of minutes (12Schmid F.X. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and hence are consistent with this slow time scale seen in reactivation. However, the unusually rigid core (9Subramaniam V. Bergenhem N. Gafni A. Steel D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Strambini G.B. Gonelli M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1985; 115: 196-200Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and large ΔG (18Chlebowski J.F. Mabrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7042-7052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for folding of AP raise the possibility that the time scale for isomerization of one or more X-Pro peptide bonds in the folded state could be unusually long. A misconfigured proline could possibly render the initially refolded AP more labile and would lead to the observed slow annealing. To evaluate the significance of proline isomerization to the long time scale events in AP refolding, we performed a GdnHCl “double-jump” experiment, to study the effect of proline isomerization on reactivation (12Schmid F.X. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and a “triple-jump” experiment to determine the proline isomerization effect on lability. The basic experimental approach is shown in Fig. 1. In the first jump, AP is placed in a strong denaturant for varying lengths of time. Due to the high activation energy of approximately 20 kcal/mol forX-Pro isomerization (11Brandts J.F. Halvorson H.R. Brennan M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4953-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), unfolding under strong denaturing conditions at low temperature uncouples the fast unfolding from the slow isomerization. The initially unfolded protein contains all prolines in their native (trans) configuration. However, with increasing incubation time in the denaturant, proline isomerization leads to an increasing accumulation of cis proline configurations in the AP chain. It is this increasing level of cis proline content that would lead to differences in refolding behavior, for these cis prolines must isomerize back to trans. In the second jump, the denaturant is rapidly diluted, refolding is initiated, and activity is measured as a function of refolding time for different denaturation times. The effect of proline isomerization on reactivation would then be detected by observing differences in the activity recovery rate. To examine the effect on lability, a third jump is added to the experiment where the refolded AP is placed in milder denaturing conditions, and the rate of unfolding is determined from the loss of activity. As in the case of reactivation, the effect of proline isomerization is detected by changes in lability as a function of time at high denaturant concentration. A further test of a role for proline isomerization is to refold AP in the presence of the enzyme peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPI), which has been found to catalyze the slow proline isomerizations in several proteins during folding (19Lang K. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Nature. 1987; 329: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 20Schonbrunner E.R. Mayer S. Tropschug M. Fischer G. Takahashi N. Schmid F.X. J. Biol.

We have tested the effects of two similar forms of PPI on the reactivation and annealing of AP, the human cyclophilin, and the Escherichia coli periplasmic PPI, an enzyme that may naturally interact with AP in vivo. These enzymes share 34% sequence identity, a similar β-sheet barrel structure (22Clubb R.T. Ferguson S.B. Walsh C.T. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2761-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and a nearly identical kinetic efficiency toward model substrates (23Liu J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4028-4032Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Purified E. coli AP, human cyclophilin, chymotrypsin, and all reagents were obtained from Sigma.E. coli PPI was obtained as a generous gift of Dr. J. C. A. Bardwell. AP was dialyzed against 100 mm Tris, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 0.1 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0, concentrated with a Centricon 30 to approximately 60 mg/ml, and stored at 4 °C until use. Enzyme concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 278 nm using A2780.1% = 0.72 (24Malamy M.H. Horecker B.L. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). AP activity was followed with the standard AP spectrophotometric assay (25Garen A. Levinthal C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 38: 470-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). 10-μl refolding AP sample was added to 0.9 ml of AP assay mixture (1.0 m Tris, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate). The change in absorbance due to the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate at 25 °C was monitored for 30 s at 410 nm (Milton Roy Spectrophotometer). AP stock was mixed with denaturing buffer (8 m GdnHCl, 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.0), equilibrated at 0 °C. Final concentrations were 10 mg/ml AP, 6.5m GdnHCl, 0.15 m glycine, 17 mmTris, 17 μm ZnCl2, 17 μmMgCl2, pH 2.3. A control sample was also prepared where stock AP was added to 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, to give the same final concentration of enzyme. AP, denatured as described above, was diluted 100-fold into refolding buffer (100 mm Tris, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 0.1 mmMgCl2, pH 8.0) at 25 °C, yielding an AP concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Enzymatic activity was assayed as a function of time for 2 h. A control sample was also prepared where control AP (from above) was diluted 100-fold into the same refolding buffer, to which 65 mm GdnHCl and 1.5 mm glycine were added. To determine AP lability, the rate of loss of enzymatic activity was determined in 4.5m GdnHCl. Aliquots from the refolding AP solution were added at five different refolding times to a denaturing buffer (8m GdnHCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0) at 25 °C, to give final concentrations of 44 μg/ml AP, 4.5 m GdnHCl, 100 mm Tris, 44 μm ZnCl2, 44 μm MgCl2. The enzymatic activity was assayed as a function of time for 1 h. Control AP (three different samples) was also subjected to the same lability experiment. The activity values were expressed as a percentage of the starting activity of the refolded AP at that time. The lability of native AP was similarly determined with the activity in denaturant expressed as a percentage of the control AP. All inactivation curves were well fit by two exponentials, %activity=100C1e−tτ1+C2e−tτ2Equation 1 with τ1,2 representing the unfolding time constants, and C 1,2 the pre-exponential amplitudes. This fit corresponds to the assumption that the isomerization of any one proline leads to a more labile form of the protein and that while additional isomerized prolines might lead to additional lability terms, the relative concentration of these more labile forms is small, and the corresponding exponential terms would be difficult to resolve. The set of five lability curves (as a function of refolding time) for each refolded AP sample, along with the three control curves, were analyzed globally (Excel) using a least squares analysis with two common unfolding time constants. The pre-exponential amplitudes were varied individually, with their sum set to 1. The rate of decrease of the amplitude of the more labile fraction (smaller τ) over refolding time determines the annealing rate. The refolding data was fit to two exponentials, with a short (approximately 20 s) initial time delay included to improve the fit. The reactivation equation used was, Activity=A∞−C1e−t−t0τ1+C2e−t−t0τ2Equation 2 with A ∞ representing the final activity, t 0 the time delay, τ1,2the time constants, and C 1,2 the pre-exponential amplitudes. All refolding curves were analyzed globally, with two common reactivation time constants and individual amplitudes that were varied as free parameters whose fractional sum was set to 1 and whose individual values were determined by optimizing the fit. Curves were also analyzed individually using two exponential fitting functions to test the validity of the assumptions of common decay times used in the global analysis. AP activity values were expressed as a fraction of the final yield, by dividing by A ∞, withC 1/A∞ andC 2/A∞ representing the fractional reactivation amplitudes. Both human and E. coli PPI activities were tested using the coupled assay with chymotrypsin and the model substrate N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-nitroanilide (20Schonbrunner E.R. Mayer S. Tropschug M. Fischer G. Takahashi N. Schmid F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3630-3635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Liu J. Albers M.W. Chen C.-M. Schreiber S.L. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2304-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). An increase in absorbance at 390 nm occurs as chymotrypsin cleaves the trans peptide. Various levels of PPI were mixed with 10 μm chymotrypsin and 50 μm peptide in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 10°C and were monitored at 390 nm for 5 min. The peptide with the trans configuration (greater than 85%) is cleaved within the deadtime of several seconds, while the cis peptide is cleaved after the slow cis-trans isomerization. Our PPI samples had catalytic efficiency values: human PPIk cat/K m = 6.7 μm−1 s−1, and E. coli PPI k cat/K m = 11.4 μm−1 s−1, which are in good agreement with established values (20Schonbrunner E.R. Mayer S. Tropschug M. Fischer G. Takahashi N. Schmid F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3630-3635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Liu J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

AP samples were denatured for 1 h at 25 °C and refolded in the presence of 0, 0.2, and 0.05 μm human PPI and 1, 0.2, and 0.05 μm E. coli PPI. Reactivation and annealing data were collected and analyzed as described above. To ensure high time resolution in the jump experiments, the initial denaturation of the protein (jump 1) needs to be rapid. Under the conditions used in this study, i.e. 6.5 mGdnHCl at pH 2.3 and T = 0 °C, the complete denaturation of AP, as monitored by circular dichroism at 222 nm, was found to occur in less that 1 min (data not shown). All experiments of the present study allowed unfolding for at least 1 min before initiating reactivation (jump 2) in order to ensure complete denaturation (no residual secondary structure). The low temperature was used to increase the proline isomerization time relative to the time scale for denaturation. The effect of proline isomerization on the lability of refolded AP was monitored using the triple jump approach. Samples of AP were initially placed in strong denaturant (jump 1) for periods ranging from 1 min to 1 h. The samples were subsequently refolded for 2 h (jump 2) and then subjected to denaturation by 4.5 m GdnHCl (jump 3). Fig. 2 shows these inactivation curves for all refolded AP samples as well as for the control AP. The curves obtained for the refolded protein are nearly identical, exhibiting clear biphasic behavior, and are strikingly different from the curve of control AP. The different inactivation curves all contain a fast and slow time constant, with an average of 5.3 min and 105.2 min, respectively. The inactivation time constants for individual AP samples were determined by the global fit of all curves obtained for that sample over refolding time (see “Materials and Methods”). These two time constants represent two distinct protein populations, with relative amounts represented by the fractional amplitudes. The more labile component represents approximately 90% of the active protein for all refolded samples following 2 h of refolding and 40% for the control sample. In the inset to Fig. 2, we plot the fraction of the more labile component after 2 h of refolding as a function of denaturation time (jump 1). The data show that at this time of refolding, there is no difference in the refolded protein, as reflected in the lability studies, regardless of denaturation time. All AP samples were then allowed to continue to refold for 1 week, during which time AP lability was monitored in order to determine the enzyme's annealing rate. Fig.3 A shows the time evolution of the inactivation curves for the AP sample that had been denatured for 1 min. The data demonstrate the structural annealing that occurs long after the recovery of activity as reported earlier (9Subramaniam V. Bergenhem N. Gafni A. Steel D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All curves were globally fit to two optimal inactivation time constants, as mentioned above. The fraction of the more labile species decreases over refolding time, and this behavior constitutes our measure of annealing. Fig.3 B shows the normalized fraction of the more labile AP as a function of refolding time for samples which have been denatured for different times. In all cases, the normalized fraction of the more labile protein decreases from approximately 0.9 to 0.5 in the course of one week. These fractions were normalized assuming an equilibrium level of 0.4 for the more labile component, the level observed for control AP. Fig. 3 C shows the rate of loss of the more labile component as a function of denaturation time, obtained from the slope of the different data sets in Fig. 3 B. The average annealing time is 290 h and is clearly independent of denaturation time. The effect of proline isomerization on the kinetics of reactivation of AP, initiated by jump 2, was determined by following the reactivation kinetics for 2 h as a function of the time between jump 1 (denaturation) and jump 2. Fig.4 presents the data obtained for AP samples that have been denatured for periods ranging from 1 min to 1 h. The reactivation curves have been normalized to the final activity value A ∞ for each data set. After 2-h refolding, the reactivation was 80–95% complete. To account for folding events that precede the recovery of activity, such as the monomer collapse and dimerization (28Reynolds J.A. Schlesinger M.J. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 3552-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8146-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an initial time lag of approximately 20 s was included, which increased the accuracy of the fit. This agrees well with the rates of monomer collapse as shown by fluorescence and circular dichroism (data not shown). Global analysis of the data assuming a biexponential recovery yielded fast and slow reactivation times of 3.3 min and 32.6 min, respectively, with corresponding amplitudes of 0.7 and 0.3. The inset to Fig. 4shows a plot of the fraction of slow reactivation component as a function of denaturation time (jump 1). The data show that the length of the initial denaturation has no discernible effect on the reactivation kinetics. The reactivation and annealing experiments were repeated following the addition of 0.2 and 0.05 μm human PPI, and 1, 0.2, and 0.05 μm E. coli PPI. All annealing rates, as well as reactivation rates and phase amplitudes, did not differ from a control sample with no PPI added (data not shown). E. coli AP is a 94-kDa homodimeric nonspecific phosphomonoesterase, containing 2 Zn2+ and 1 Mg2+ per subunit, which are necessary for structure and catalysis (30Coleman J.E. Gettins P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 53: 381-452Google Scholar, 31Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 32Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 441-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). In our present study, we have observed the following three characteristics during the refolding of AP from the GdnHCl denatured state: (i) in freshly refolded AP, 90% of the protein is highly susceptible to denaturation in 4.5 m GdnHCl compared with 40% labile fraction in the control; (ii) a prolonged postactivation annealing process occurs with an average time scale of 290 h, where the AP gradually shifts to the less labile state; (iii) AP reactivation displays a distinctly biphasic kinetics with approximately 70% of the activity recovering with a rate of 0.3 min−1 and 30% with a rate of 0.031 min−1. Proline isomerization, a slow reaction that has traditionally been proposed to explain long-lived folding events in proteins, is certainly a reasonable hypothesis for any or all of the above observations, and the goal of this study was to test this proposition. The above double-jump experiment describes an established approach, which relies on the fact that proline isomerization is a relatively slow process and that varying denaturation times allow the initiation of refolding from protein states that contain different numbers of non-native prolines. For this analysis it is necessary to estimate the number of cis prolines expected per subunit over the various denaturation periods used in this study. Individual proline isomerization rates within a polypeptide chain can vary widely, depending on sequence, chain length, and on the presence of conformationally restrictive disulfide bonds (11Brandts J.F. Halvorson H.R. Brennan M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4953-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 33Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The large number of prolines in AP (21 per subunit) further complicates this analysis. Much of the current knowledge about the rates of protein proline isomerization has been obtained from studies with bovine ribonuclease A, and we will use these data as an estimate for the isomerization rates for AP prolines. Schmid (12Schmid F.X. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) found that at 0 °C the rate of conversion between the fast and slow folding forms (which differ in the configuration of the Tyr-92-Pro-93 peptide bond) was 0.0011 s−1 (900 s). Other double jump experiments at 10.5 °C have shown a cis-trans isomerization rate of 0.0055 s−1 (34Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Calculating a value for 0 °C from the latter data by using a 20 kcal/mol activation energy (11Brandts J.F. Halvorson H.R. Brennan M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4953-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar) yields a lower isomerization rate constant of 0.0014 s−1 (709 s). Since this value results in an earlier accumulation of cis prolines, and thus provides a more conservative estimate for our analysis, we have used this for the characteristic time constant for cis-trans isomerization of prolines in AP at 0 °C. To estimate the average number of cis prolines as a function of denaturation time, we note that based on the x-ray determined structure of AP, all 21 prolines are taken to be trans at the initiation of the denaturation, while 20%, i.e. 4.2, are assumed to be cis at equilibrium (11Brandts J.F. Halvorson H.R. Brennan M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4953-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 12Schmid F.X. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The isomerization equation used was, [Cis]=4.21−e−tτEquation 3 which follows immediately from the solution to the coupled first order rate equations and knowledge of the equilibrium (i.e. t → ∞) value of [cis]. The results for different denaturation times are given in TableI, where, for example, the calculation predicts that the sample denatured for 1 min would have on average 0.34 cis prolines, while the sample denatured for 60 min would closely approach the equilibrium value of 4.2 cis prolines.Table IAverage number of cis prolines per AP chain during denaturation timeDenaturation timeAverage cis Pro expectedmin10.3420.6561.67153.02303.87604.17Expected number of cis prolines during denaturation at 0 °C, using previously determined trans-cis isomerization rates, were calculated using Equation 3. The time constant τ = 709 s was calculated from a double-jump experiment at 10.5 °C (34Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have assumed throughout that all prolines in the fully denatured chain are equally likely to isomerize at similar rates; however it is possible that the His-129–Pro-130 bond in AP may isomerize faster due to intramolecular acid catalysis (35Reimer U. Mokdad N.E. Schutkowski M. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13802-13808Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Expected number of cis prolines during denaturation at 0 °C, using previously determined trans-cis isomerization rates, were calculated using Equation 3. The time constant τ = 709 s was calculated from a double-jump experiment at 10.5 °C (34Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have assumed throughout that all prolines in the fully denatured chain are equally likely to isomerize at similar rates; however it is possible that the His-129–Pro-130 bond in AP may isomerize faster due to intramolecular acid catalysis (35Reimer U. Mokdad N.E. Schutkowski M. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13802-13808Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Taking the most conservative approach to the analysis of the data,i.e. assuming that isomerization of any one proline in AP has a disruptive impact during refolding that will cause slow events, let us examine the two extremes of denaturation time, the 1- and 60-min samples. One would expect that following 1 min unfolding ∼66% of the AP molecules in the sample would still be in the all-trans configuration and hence rapidly refold directly into the native state (becoming fully enzymatically active and displaying the lability pattern of control AP). The anticipated slow reactivation phase of ∼34% would then be attributed to the misconfigured cis AP. This agrees well with the observed 30% slow reactivation phase (Fig. 4). However, the observed lability curve for the 1 min sample displays a 90% more labile phase, which is much larger and inconsistent with the reactivation slow phase, if this is due to proline isomerization. At 60 min unfolding, in contrast, one would expect the full impact of proline isomerization to be manifested both in the reactivation kinetics and in the lability, as every AP chain would contain misconfigured cis prolines (average of 4), and both the more labile and slow reactivation phases would be expected to approach 100%. Our results (Figs. 2 and 4) clearly show that this does not occur and that the denaturation time has no discernible effect on either process, thus ruling out any significant role for proline isomerization. The above stated conclusion is further strengthened by considering the annealing rates, for which similar arguments can be made. If proline isomerization affects AP lability, then one would expect that a greater number of cis prolines (generated during longer incubation times) should lead to a noticeable increase in the annealing time, since more prolines must reisomerize back to trans to produce the native enzyme. This contrasts with our observation that the annealing times for all refolded AP samples are nearly constant (Fig. 3, Band C), with an average of 290 h and no increase in this time is observed with longer denaturation. The annealing times appear to be unaffected by cis content, and the proline hypothesis fails in this instance as well. The experiments repeated in the presence of PPI confirm the above results. PPI has been shown to catalyze the isomerization of mis-configured X-Pro bonds in folding proteins (19Lang K. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Nature. 1987; 329: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 20Schonbrunner E.R. Mayer S. Tropschug M. Fischer G. Takahashi N. Schmid F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3630-3635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Veeraraghavan S. Nall B.T. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15134-15139Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It provides a more direct test of proline isomerization as a rate-limiting step. However, in the case of refolding in the presence of PPI, a negative result as we have found here may imply that a proline was simply inaccessible to the PPI and hence does not conclusively rule out proline isomerizations. An example would be a deeply buried proline that would be difficult for the PPI to bind and isomerize. For this reason, PPI experiments, when showing no effect, would be inconclusive in themselves. Taken together with the double-jump experiments shown above, they provide strong evidence for the absence of proline isomerization as a rate-limiting step in the refolding of AP. The experiments described above show that neither the extreme lability of freshly refolded AP, the slow annealing of the protein over time, or the slow reactivation phase are likely to be caused by the isomerization of one or more of the 21 X-Pro peptide bonds in AP. This conclusion was reached under the assumption that all prolines are “essential” (10Cook K.H. Schmid F.X. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6157-6161Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and will cause observable slow refolding effects when isomerized. A similar conclusion can be reached, given the experimental data, if one makes the arguably more realistic assumption of a lesser number of essential prolines. An analysis of the x-ray structure of AP shows that all but 3 prolines are surface-exposed to some extent. One would expect that the most buried of the prolines would be less tolerant of misconfiguration and thus most disruptive in the cis form. If this is the case, one would still expect refolding differences as a function of cis content, as more of the AP during the initial denaturation accumulate these few essential prolines. It appears from the results of this study that there are no prolines in AP that become disruptive in the cis configuration. This is consistent with a computational analysis of proline configurations in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, where in many cases, the structure was able to accommodate non-native prolines with little destabilization of native structure (36Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). At equilibrium, we would expect approximately 4 cis prolines in denatured AP, equally distributed in all combinations among all 21 prolines. These cis-rich forms of AP have similar annealing and reactivation behavior as the chains with lower cis content. This surprising non-heterogeneity in refolding is similar to the results of studies on the 9 proline penicillinase (37Creighton T.E. Pain R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 137: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and the 8 proline fibronectin type III module (38Plaxco K.W. Spitzfaden C. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10703-10706Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), where the expected effects of proline isomerization were not found. It thus seems that all possible combinations of cis prolines in refolding AP may incorporate into the folded chain and isomerize gradually without affecting lability, annealing, or reactivation. Thus, since proline isomerization does not appear to represent any rate-limiting folding step, it remains unclear whether there were any proline interactions with PPI during folding. In summary, the multi-jump and PPI experiments described above demonstrate that proline isomerization is an unlikely origin of the slow time scale events in the postactivational recovery of AP lability or of the slow phase observed in the regain of activity following denaturation, indicating that the origin of this behavior is due to more complex structural behavior. It is possible that the lability changes are similar to the long time scale events seen during metal rebinding to apoprotein, which are due to equilibration between metal binding sites (39Gettins P. Coleman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 396-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, changes in lability represent shifts in the activation energy for unfolding, and it is well known that zinc plays a critical role in stabilizing AP (30Coleman J.E. Gettins P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 53: 381-452Google Scholar, 31Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 32Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 441-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is known that refolding of the thermally denatured apoenzyme occurs on a long time scale (18Chlebowski J.F. Mabrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7042-7052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it may be that the structural changes associated with this reaction are also important in refolding of the holoenzyme. Present work is focusing on studies of the time scales associated with various structural signatures of the apomonomer and metal binding."
