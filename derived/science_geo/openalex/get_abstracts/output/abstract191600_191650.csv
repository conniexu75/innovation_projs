This treatment had marked decreasing effect on the α-amylase activities of take-diastase extracts, and on the β-amylase activities of extracts from ungerminated wheat, barley, soybean, and sweet potato, and of solutions of purified β-amylase from sweet potato. This decreasing effect wasdepenednt on the source of the enzyme as well as on the ezyme concentration in the treating mixture. Treatment of these enzyme solutions with 0.1% HCN at pH 5.0 had no decreasing effect on both α- and β-amylase activities. Potassium carbonate in 0.1% concentration showed approxinmately the same degree of inhibition on these enzyme solutions as compared with 0.1% KCN, Moreover, these 2 reagents had approximately the same raising effect on the pH values of the treating mixtures. The above results support the view, in contrast to that of ROY and UNDERKOFLER (1), that cyanide has no inhibitory effect on both α- and β-(or saccharogenic) amylase activities of the enzyme solutions used in this investigation. The apparent inhibitory effect of sodium cyanide, which they had observed in their experiments, may be the results of combined effects of pH and enzyme concentration on the pH-heat-sta-bility properties of enzyme solutions."
