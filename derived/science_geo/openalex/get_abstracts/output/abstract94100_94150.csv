https://openalex.org/W1699447737,"Using the selective membrane-solubilizing properties of digitonin and a rapid centrifugation method to separate cytoplasmic and mitochondrial components, the metabolic state of mitochondrial glutathione was investigated in isolated rat hepatocytes. Two pools of GSH were released from hepatocytes incubated with increasing concentrations of digitonin. The largest pool (about 85% of cellular total) was released simultaneously with lactate dehydrogenase, the other pool with citrate synthase, indicating cytoplasmic and mitochondrial locations, respectively. The t1/2 of the mitochondrial pool was estimated by linear regression analysis to be 30 +/- 3 h, while the cytoplasmic pool turned over with a t1/2 of about 2 +/- 0.1 h. The rate of incorporation of [35S]methionine or cysteine into the cytoplasmic pool of GSH, when corrected for turnover, was 15 times greater than into the mitochondrial pool. Mitochondrial GSH was not depleted after 60 min with 185 microM diethyl maleate with or without 75 microM bis-1,3-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, a specific inhibitor of glutathione reductase, whereas cytoplasmic levels were reduced to 40% and 10% of control values, respectively. In vivo experiments, using L-(alpha S,5S)-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid to inactive gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase to limit cysteine formation from plasma GSH, demonstrated that in the absence of label reincorporation, liver glutathione exhibits a biphasic turnover. The rates of decay (half-lives) and percentages of total GSH under these conditions correlate well with the half-lives and pool distribution seen in the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic populations of GSH found in the isolated hepatocytes."

We now present evidence that mannosidase II (Tulsiani, D. R. P., Opheim, D. J., and Touster, O. (1977) J. Biol Chem. 252, 3227-3233) is the Golgi enzyme that converts GlcNAc Man5 species to GlcNAcMan3 species in completing the mannosyl trimming process required in the biosynthesis of complex type glycoproteins. GlcNAc([3H]Man)5GlcNAc-mannosidase and p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-mannosidase activities copurify throughout the preparative procedure and show the same properties. In addition to mannosidase IA (Tabas, I., and Kornfeld, S. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11655-11663), a second alpha-1,2-mannosidase (mannosidase IB) can be prepared from Golgi membranes which is effective in converting Man9GlcNAc to Man5GlcNAc. The two alpha-1,2-mannosidases are very similar in catalytic properties, but they are also distinguishable by several criteria. Although these two enzymes have not been extensively purified, several lines of evidence lead to the tentative conclusion that they are distinct enzymes. They appear to be present in comparable activities in the Golgi membranes and together account for the alpha-1,2-mannosidase activity of these membranes. The particular role of each alpha-1,2-mannosidase remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1574509858,"Platelets contain small amounts of a variety of free fatty acids but essentially no free arachidonate. When free fatty acids are incubated with platelets, there is preferential incorporation of arachidonic acid and 8,-11,14-eicosatrienoic acid compared to other fatty acids. We now explain these findings by the discovery that platelets contain two long chain acyl-CoA synthetases. One shows activity with a range of different fatty acids, similar to long chain acyl-CoA synthetases studied previously. A crude platelet membrane preparation contains this enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 0.75 nmol of oleoyl-CoA/min/10(9) platelets. The other enzyme is specific for the prostaglandin precursors arachidonic acid and 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid. Based on the ability of fatty acids to inhibit arachidonate and 8,11,14-eicosatrienoate activation, we conclude that other fatty acids including linoleic, 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic, and oleic acids are not substrates for the enzyme. Platelet membranes catalyze formation of 2.9 nmol of arachidonoyl-CoA/min/10(9) platelets and 2.5 nmol of 8,11,14-eicosatrienoyl-CoA/min/10(9) platelets. Arachidonoyl-CoA synthetase has optimal activity at pH 8 and requires ATP (Km = 0.5 mM), Mg2+ (Km = 2.5 mM), CoA (Km = 0.13 mM), and arachidonic acid (Km = 0.03 mM). We propose that the arachidonate-specific acyl-CoA synthetase may control the level of free arachidonic acid in platelets, limiting prostaglandin synthesis by the unstimulated cell and capturing free arachidonate from extracellular sources."
https://openalex.org/W1489676968,"1-Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine can be synthesized either by acetylation of 1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or by transcholination of 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol. Addition of opsonized zymosan to isolated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes induces a fast, transient, up to 10-fold activation of the acetyltransferase reaction without affecting the cholinephosphotransferase pathway. Based on the following results, we propose that the generation of 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes during phagocytosis is mediated by a stimulation of the acetyltransferase reaction: 1) the time course of acetyltransferase activation agrees with it being the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; and 2) a close correlation exists (r = 0.91) between the generation of 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine in response to various doses of zymosan and the magnitude of acetyltransferase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1502473233,"The production of ketone bodies by the isolated perfused rat liver has been measured by the dilution of the specific activity of tracer amounts of beta-hydroxy[3-14C]butyrate and by accumulation in the perfusate. The latter method has been found to underestimate ketogenesis by 12 to 44% because it does not take into account acetoacetate utilization by the liver. Incorporation of ketone bodies into fatty acids and 3-beta-hydroxysterols was compared to total lipid synthesis measured by incorporation of tritium from tritiated water. A preferential labeling of 3-beta-hydroxysterols over fatty acids was observed, which is consistent with the activation of acetoacetate in the cytosol by acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase. Ketone bodies contribute 19 to 80% of the carbon incorporated into sterols and up to 22% of the carbon incorporated into fatty acids, depending upon the metabolic status of the liver. The activity of acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase is more than sufficient to account for the rate of ketone body utilization. Conditions that decrease the citrate cleavage pathway of acetyl group translocation through the mitochondrial membrane are associated with an increase in carbon flux through acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase. Formation of acetoacetate in the mitochondria and its utilization in the cytosol thus appear to be a secondary pathway of acetyl group translocation operating concurrently with the predominant citrate cleavage pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1530496614,"A coenzyme F430-reducing hydrogenase from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum has been purified 25-fold, to approximately 50% homogeneity. Following anaerobic preincubation in high salt under reducing conditions, the purified enzyme exhibits equal catalytic activity (turnover number = 725 s-1) toward the artificial 1-electron acceptor, methyl viologen, and the physiological 2-electron acceptor, 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin (F420). The enzyme had the following Km values (micromolarity) under the described assay conditions: 420 (methyl viologen, pH 9.0), 19 (F420, pH 7.2), 34 (Fo, 7.8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin, pH 7.2), 10 (H2, Fo as co-substrate, pH 7.2), 2 (H2, methyl viologen as co-substrate, pH 9.0). The native protein is oligomeric (apparent Mr greater than 500,000) and is composed of three distinct subunits with Mr - 40,000, 31,000, and 26,000 in the ratio of 2:2:1, leading to a minimum Mr = 170,000. In addition to 33 atoms of Fe and 24 atoms of acid-labile sulfur, the F420-hydrogenase contains 2.3 mol of FAD/mol of Mr - 170,000. This activity is chromatographically distinct from a smaller methanogen hydrogenase capable of rapid viologen reduction, but which only very slowly reduces 5-deazariboflavins."
https://openalex.org/W1544906997,"The subunit composition and dimeric species of tropomyosin with respect to its alpha and beta subunits have been analyzed from several physiologically different types of skeletal muscle of the rabbit using one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The findings indicate that there are two types of tropomyosin distributions in rabbit muscles: one in which alpha 2 is the prevalent species and another in which alpha beta is prevalent. While the alpha 2-prevalent pattern is characteristic of some fast muscles, notably longissimus dorsi and psoas, it is not the only pattern found in fast muscles. Plantaris, which is histochemically indistinguishable from longissimus dorsi, exhibits an alpha beta-prevalent distribution. This observation shows that there are at least two types of fast white muscle fibers which differ in their tropomyosin composition and species. The alpha beta-pattern is also found in fast red, slow, and mixed muscles. The fast and slow alpha beta-prevalent patterns can be distinguished electrophoretically because of heterogeneity of their subunits. Finally, the relative abundance of the different forms of tropomyosin in each of the muscles studied indicates that the tropomyosin dimer does not assemble randomly from alpha and beta subunits, but that alpha beta is assembled preferentially in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1571857346,"We have isolated and characterized a Man/GlcNAc-specific lectin from rat liver. The specificity of this lectin resembles that of the previously reported Man/GlcNAc-specific receptor activity present on the surface of hepatic reticuloendothelial cells when tested with simple sugars, but can be distinguished from the latter by utilizing characterized glycopeptides and glycoproteins. The lectin isolated from liver originates predominantly from hepatocytes rather than reticuloendothelial cells. It is found in microsomes upon subcellular fractionation and is not expressed on the surface of isolated hepatocytes. In addition, specific antisera to the lectin do not prevent endocytosis by hepatic reticuloendothelial cells. The lectin can be solubilized by treatment of whole liver or isolated hepatocyte homogenates with buffers containing 0.2 M NaCl in the absence of any detergent, indicating that it may be either a soluble protein or a peripheral membrane protein. Based on the physical properties, oligosaccharide specificity, and subcellular location, this lectin does not appear to be the same as the Man/GlcNAc-specific activity which mediates endocytosis by hepatic reticuloendothelial cells and presumably has a different function."
https://openalex.org/W1594194193,"The enzyme catalyzing the second step in the biohydrogenation pathway of linoleic acid by Butyrivibrio fibrosolvens cis-9,trans-11-octadecadienoate reductase has been purified to near homogeneity. It has a molecular weight of 60,000 and appears to be a single subunit. The purified enzyme contains 2 mol of iron, 10 mol of fucose, and 12 mol of galactose per 60,000 g. The iron, but not the carbohydrate, is required for enzymatic activity. Phosphatidylethanolamine was also found to be associated with the purified enzyme. Unlike the cell extract that can reduce the double bond of the fatty acid with NADH or alpha-tocopherolquinol as a reductant, the purified enzyme can utilize only alpha-tocopherolquinol. This indicates that another component of the reduction system exists that couples the production of alpha-tocopherolquinol to the oxidation of NADH."
https://openalex.org/W1507355636,"We have recently reported that the entry of 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts occurs by receptor-mediated endocytosis (Cheng, S. Y., Maxfield, F. R., Robbins, J., Willingham, M. C., and Pastan, I. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77: 3425-3429). In this communication, we evaluated the functional significance of this mode of entry using GH3 cells, a growth hormone-producing cell line which has a high number of T3 nuclear receptors. T3-specific, saturable membrane uptake systems were demonstrated in GH3 cells. Monodansylcadaverine, an inhibitor of alpha 2-macroglobulin, epidermal growth factor, vesicular stomatitis virus, and T3 uptake in fibroblasts, blocked virtually all of the cellular uptake of T3, with a half-maximal concentration of 29 microM. Concomitant with the inhibition of the cellular uptake of T3, the accumulation of T3 into nuclei was reduced. The inhibitory effect of monodansylcadaverine on the reduction of T3 incorporation into nuclei was not due to the inhibition of binding to nuclear receptors, but probably was due to a decrease in the cytoplasmic availability of T3 as a result of inhibition of cellular entry. These results indicate that the uptake of T3 by receptor-mediated endocytosis is a physiologically significant process."

https://openalex.org/W1533649603,"A glycerophospholipid:cholesterol acyltransferase has been purified to near homogeneity from cell-free culture supernatants of Aeromonas salmonicida. The characteristics of the enzyme distinguish it from bacterial phospholipases; however, it shares several properties with the lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase of mammalian plasma. Thus, the enzyme inhibits 2-positional specificity as an acyltransferase and it will act as a phospholipase A2 in the absence of cholesterol. Furthermore, it has no divalent cation requirement and it is stimulated both by albumin and by human apolipoprotein A-I. Unlike the mammalian acyltransferase, however, the bacterial enzyme is not specific for phosphatidylcholine and in addition it can use human erythrocyte membranes as substrates. Similar to Naja naja phospholipase A2, it acts asymmetrically on intact erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1676110220,"The structures of O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides from plasma membranes of AH 66 ascites hepatoma cells have been determined. Glycopeptides were prepared from a Triton X-100 extract of the cells by pronase digestion. From the digest, the glycopeptide containing O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides was isolated by gel filtration and electrophoresis on a cellulose acetate block. The oligosaccharide chains were isolated as reduced oligosaccharides by treating the glycopeptide with alkaline borohydride. Neutral and acidic oligosaccharides were separated on a column of Dowex 1, and then each of them was further fractionated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (superfine), high voltage paper electrophoresis, and paper chromatography. One reduced monosaccharide, three neutral, and five acidic reduced oligosaccharides were isolated. On the basis of carbohydrate compositions, mass spectra of permethylated oligosaccharides, methylation analysis, and exoglycosidase digestion, their structures were deduced to be as follows: (formula, see text)."
https://openalex.org/W1495963043,"The site of synthesis of the higher molecular weight precursor of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (Sonderegger, P., Jaussi, R., and Christen, P. (1980) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 94, 1256-1260) has been determined by separation of free and membrane-bound polysomes under ionic conditions imitating the intracellular milieu and in vitro read-out translation of the two polysome fractions in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The amounts of the precursor of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase synthesized by free and membrane-bound polysomes were compared with the relative extent of the synthesized of cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase in the same fractions. Only a small (less than 10% of total) and for both isoenzymes quantitatively equivalent fraction was found to be produced by the membrane-bound polysome fraction; very likely, it has to be attributed to contaminating free polysomes. Apparently, the import of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase into the mitochondria does not involve an association of polysomes with intracellular membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1921983408,"Progesterone receptor from the chick oviduct was characterized in the presence of sodium molybdate, an agent which blocks receptor transformation and maintains the receptor in an aggregated state. In sucrose gradients containing 10 mM molybdate, receptor from total cytosol sedimented with a peak at 8.9 +/- 0.1 S in the presence of 10 mM KCl and at 7.9 +/- 0.1 S in the presence of 300 mM KCl. Two receptor forms could be separated on DEAE-cellulose. One eluted at 100 mM KCl (type 1) and the other at 160 mM KCl (type 2). Both forms sedimented at 7.8 to 7.9 S and gel filtration in the presence of 300 mM KCl showed that type 1 had a Stokes radius of 73 A and type 2, of 76 A. Calculations based on the Stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients yielded estimated molecular weights of 234,000 (type 1) and 244,000 (type 2). These two 8 S receptor forms were analyzed for their content of the smaller A and B receptor components which had been identified previously in cytosol. After removal of molybdate, the type 1 and type 2 receptors were dissociated into 3.5 S forms by treatment with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate followed by borohydride reduction. The smaller forms were then identified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The type 2 receptor contained only the B component. Type 1 receptor also yielded only one smaller hormone-binding component. This form resembled the A receptor but appeared to be slightly larger and more acidic. Therefore, under these conditions, the A and B forms of progesterone receptor are not found together in a dimer. Instead, B is found in one 8 S complex and A, or a precursor of A, is found in another 8 S complex."
https://openalex.org/W1529329924,"Lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) and cholesterol at 1:1 molar ratio form multilamellar and, on sonication, unilamellar liposomes in water. Calorimetric scannings of varied mixtures in water give evidence for the existence of a 1:1 complex of the lipids. The permeability of the 1:1 bilayer against glycerol, at 22-42 degrees C, is lower than that of phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol bilayers; the energy of activation of permeation is 73% higher. This implies a low groundstate of the entropy of activation of permeation. Unilamellar lysoPC-cholesterol 1:1 liposomes, isolated by gel exclusion chromatography, are able to incorporate no more than 8 to 10% excess lysoPC and no additional cholesterol at all. Their physical parameters such a outer radius (14.8 nm) and bilayer thickness (4.2 nm) are between those reported for phosphatidylcholine vesicles and phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol vesicles. The outside-inside distribution of lysoPC in the small vesicles (determined by 31P-NMR) is 2.0. A comparison of 13C-NMR spectra of lysoPC (in 2H2O) and lysoPC-cholesterol vesicles shows that in the vesicles the signals for the carboxyl carbon of lysoPC as well as those for carbons 1 and 2 (and, partly, 3) of motional restriction in this region of the molecule. The low groundstate of the entropy of activation of permeation, and the immobilization of the glycerol moiety of the lysoPC, argue for a high degree of structural organization in the belt regions of the lysoPC-cholesterol bilayer, and for lipid-lipid complexing via hydrogen bonding in these regions."
https://openalex.org/W1582126809,"Four cytoplasmically synthesized rat liver mitochondrial enzymes, located either as soluble enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix (L-glutamate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase or in the intermembrane space (sulfite oxidase) or as an integral membrane protein located on the matrix face of the inner mitochondrial membrane (D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase), were all shown to be synthesized as precursors larger than their mature counterparts by 1000-6000 daltons. These larger forms were detected in vitro, in a cell-free protein synthesizing system programmed with either total rat liver RNA or with RNA isolated from free polysomes or with free polysomes, and in vivo, in the two cases that were investigated (L-glutamate dehydrogenase and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase), by pulse labeling of Buffalo rat liver cells in culture. The intracellular site of synthesis of all four mitochondrial enzymes was shown to be primarily on free polysomes and not on membrane-bound polysomes."

https://openalex.org/W1520176932,"Genetic variation of human transcortin was investigated on neuraminidase-treated plasma samples by polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing followed by immunofixation of transcortin on cellulose-acetate strips. This procedure was applied systematically to 500 plasma samples obtained from individuals of Caucasian origin. Most samples showed one band focusing at pH 5.52. In three unrelated samples, a two-band pattern was obtained consisting of the normal band (pI 5.52) and a cathodic band of equal color intensity (pI 5.60). Family studies showed that this transcortin variant, which we call transcortin Leuven, is autosomally inherited. In a family of Polish origin two individuals homozygous for transcortin Leuven were found. A striking feature of transcortin Leuven is that it has a 2.6-fold reduced affinity for cortisol at 4 degrees C and a 3.6-fold reduced affinity at 28 degrees C. This lowered affinity is due to an enhanced dissociation rate of the transcortin-cortisol complex. As for normal asialotranscortin, a cortisol-induced charge difference of 0.15 pH unit was observed for this variant."
https://openalex.org/W1488315234,"Avian vitellogenin consists of two major species designated VTG I and VTG II. Rooster hepatocytes were employed to identify intracellular forms of the vitellogenins and to characterize biosynthetic intermediates of VTG I and VTG II. After labeling with [3H]serine, intracellular vitellogenin radioactivity was seen in mature VTG I and VTG II but was primarily found in two species, pVTG I and pVTG II, which showed greater mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The pVTG species were identified as vitellogenins by reaction with antibodies against plasma VTG II and against the mixture of VTG I and VTG II. Immunological and peptide mapping procedures were used to relate pVTG I and pVTG II to secreted VTG I and VTG II, respectively. Pulse-labeling and pulse-chase experiments showed that the pVTG species are precursors to the secreted vitellogenins and are thus discrete intermediates in the biosynthesis of the vitellogenins. Additional labeling experiments showed that the pVTG species are glycosylated but not phosphorylated. The stages of vitellogenin biosynthesis may be ordered as follows: polypeptide synthesis leads to glycosylation leads to phosphorylation leads to secretion. The presence of only small quantities of the phosphorylated vitellogenins intracellularly indicates that when phosphorylation is completed, the vitellogenins are rapidly secreted from the hepatocyte. The differences in the electrophoretic mobilities of the pVTG and VTG species suggested that sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis does not accurately estimate the molecular weights of the heavily phosphorylated vitellogenins. This was confirmed directly by showing that the mobility of plasma vitellogenin increased upon dephosphorylation. An independent estimate of vitellogenin molecular weight was made by gel chromatography in 7 M guanidine-HCl. With this method, the molecular weights of the pVTG and VTG species were indistinguishable and in agreement with the molecular weight of the pVTG species as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These analyses indicate that the vitellogenin polypeptide has Mr approximately equal to 180,000. This value is 60,000-70,000 less than commonly estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The implications of this lower molecular weight are discussed in relation to vitellogenin structure and the egg yolk polypeptides which may derive from each vitellogenin."

https://openalex.org/W1599764563,"Pulse-chase experiments with [3H]lysine-labeled tissue culture cells reveal that newly synthesized nucleosomal histones H2B, H3, H4 (and possibly H2A) in chromatin are more accessible to histone acetylase in vivo than are older, pre-existing histones. Thus, when rat hepatoma cells are first pulse-labeled and then incubated in medium containing n-butyrate which blocks histone deacetylation, these newly synthesized histones become acetylated to a far greater extent than do their older homologues. As judged by its increased susceptibility to acetylation, the new chromatin matures at a surprisingly slow rate, the estimated half-time for maturation being about 35 min. Based on this data, we suggest that newly synthesized chromatin is in a relatively extended, accessible conformation, and that it slowly returns to a more compact conformation as it matures."
https://openalex.org/W1580077448,"Microtubule protein from bovine brain was reacted at pH 6.7 with formaldehyde and NaCNBH3. These reagents react specifically with protein amino groups, causing their conversion to mono- and dimethylated forms (Jentoft, N., and Dearborn, D. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4359-4365). Reductive methylation both inhibited microtubule assembly and induced extensive depolymerization in assembled microtubules. These effects occurred at low levels of methylation (10%) and appeared to arise from an alteration in tubulin which rendered tubulin assembly incompetent. This alteration had no significant effect on colchicine or GTP binding or on the critical tubulin concentration required for assembly. Comparative methylation studies over a range of formaldehyde concentrations involving microtubule polymer, microtubule protein, and several test proteins suggested that assembly inhibition results from the methylation of one or two highly reactive amino groups in the alpha-chain. The reactivities of these amino group(s) were reduced in the polymerized and denatured states."

It is devoid of nonspecific endonucleases, specific endonucleases for apurinic and apyrimidinic sites, 3-methyladenine or 7-methylguanine-DNA-glycosylases. It behaves as a monomer protein of 19,400 daltons. It has an isoelectric point of 7.0 +/- 0.1. It has an optimal activity between pH 5.0 and 7.0. It has no cofactor requirement and is not inhibited by EDTA. Uracil-DNA-glycosylase is highly specific for DNA containing dUMP residues, releasing uracil as product of the reaction. It is 2-fold more active on single-stranded DNA than on double-stranded DNA. If it releases uracil dimers from ultraviolet-irradiated PBS1 DNA, it is at the threshold of the detection. The apparent Km is 7 X 10(-8) M, and uracil acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor with a Ki of 3.2 X 10(-4) M. Cis-syn cyclogbutadiuracil also is a potent inhibitor, while some analogs, produced by x-irradiation of uracil and thymine, are weak inhibitors. Spermine, between 10 and 400 microM, increases the enzymatic activity by 50% and is not inhibitory at other concentrations. Spermidine activates the enzyme at concentrations of 40 to 120 microM, but becomes inhibitory at 200 and 400 microM. A new finding is that drugs which intercalate in DNA, such as ethidium bromide and ellipticine, cause a 2- to 2.5-fold activation of this enzyme activity. The concentrations giving maximal activation depend on the drug. The enzyme does not behave as a processive enzyme during uracil excision."
https://openalex.org/W1575279910,"Preformed Cs2SO4 zonal gradients were used to purify aggregates from proteoglycan preparations derived from associative extracts of the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma. Zonal gradients were used in solvents with different concentrations of guanidine HCl and different solvent pH values to study the mechanisms for dissociating the aggregates. Aggregates are stable in concentrations of guanidine HCl up to 1.5 M at pH 6.6. At 2 M guanidine HCl, partial dissociation occurs over 20 h in which a link protein is completely dissociated for every monomer proteoglycan dissociated from the aggregate structure. This suggests that in this solvent disaggregation occurs concurrent with complete separation of link protein from monomer. At solvent pH 2.7 to 3.3 in ionic conditions which normally promote aggregation, dissociation occurs by a mechanism in which the link protein remains associated with monomer. Thus, link protein-monomer complexes dissociate as bimolecular units from hyaluronic acid; such complexes then exhibit physical properties indistinguishable from pure monomers. The link protein-monomer complexes reassociate with hyaluronic acid to form link-stabilized aggregates when the solvent pH is raised to pH 7, i.e. to associative conditions. The study provides additional evidence for the role that link protein-monomer interactions have in proteoglycan aggregate structures."
https://openalex.org/W171155113,"The nucleoskeleton, a macromolecular complex whose major structural elements are DNA and protein, is purported to be at least in part responsible for the gross morphology of the nucleus. This structure can be isolated from the nuclei of cells in all stages of the cell cycle with the exception of mitosis when no nuclei are present. We had previously proposed that during mitosis, the nucleoskeletal elements are reorganized and become part of mitotic chromosomes (Keller, J. M., and Riley, D. E. (1976) Science 193, 399-401). In order to test this possibility, we have compared the proteins of the nucleoskeleton to chromosomal proteins of similar solubility by one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by peptide mapping. We have found that the major proteins of the nucleoskeleton are also major proteins of the chromosome scaffold. In addition, our data indicate that at least two of the nucleoskeletal proteins may be modified during the transition of the cell into mitosis. These data suggest that the nuclear dissolution associated with open mitosis is accompanied by a gross rearrangement of the nucleoskeletal elements to form components of metaphase chromosomes. This reorganization may be triggered by modification of several of the nucleoskeletal proteins. These observations appear to distinguish the nucleoskeletal proteins from the major nuclear lamina proteins which have been shown by others to be dispersed throughout the cell at mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1531416894,"Methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.9) from Clostridium formicoaceticum has been purified to a specific activity of 469 mumol min-1 mg-1 at 35 degrees C, pH 7.2. The purified enzyme is homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, sedimentation velocity, and gel filtration profiles. The molecular weight is 41,000 +/- 200 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. A subunit molecular weight of approximately 25,500 was obtained using sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The enzyme apparently is a dimer. The Stokes radius determined by gel filtration is 29.6 A. The apparent Km at pH 7.2 and 35 degrees C for 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate is 0.19 mM. The pure enzyme does not contain any 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase or 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activities."

https://openalex.org/W1591125023,"Liver from goats with an inherited deficiency of beta-D-mannosidase appears only partially deficient in beta-mannosidase (40% of normal values) when assayed with synthetic beta-mannoside substrates at pH 5.0. Other tissues such as brain and cultured skin fibroblasts show an almost complete deficiency of beta-mannosidase activity. Fractionation of supernatant solutions of normal goat liver on columns of concanavalin A bound to Sepharose 4B resolved beta-mannosidase into a bound (acidic) form (pH optimum, 5.0 to 5.5) and an unbound (neutral) form (broad pH optimum from 5.0 to 8.0). Both forms were heat-labile, inhibited by sodium taurocholate (0.1%) and insensitive to divalent cations such as zinc. However, only the acid lysosomal) form was able to hydrolyze a Man beta GlcNAc beta [3H]GlcNAc trisaccharide. Comparable fractionation of liver from affected goats revealed normal levels of the unbound (neutral) form but a complete absence of the bound (acidic, lysosomal) form. Fractionation of liver from an obligate heterozygote goat revealed normal neutral and 50% of the acidic. These studies suggest that goat liver contains both lysosomal beta-mannosidase (acidic form; deficient in beta-mannosidosis) and nonlysosomal beta-mannosidase (neutral) activity."

https://openalex.org/W1494740029,"Human serum albumin and phospholipids can interact to cause a synergistic sterol release from mammalian cells in tissue culture. In the presence of the complexes formed between albumin and saturated phosphatidylcholine, release was twice as great as that which occurred with the unsaturated phospholipid complexes. Within the saturated series, sterol release increased with chain length until the number of carbon atoms in the acyl group was 18, after which sterol release decreased. In the unsaturated series, sterol release decreased as the number of double bonds increased. Branching of the acyl chain, or analogues with the polar group in the sn-2 position reduced sterol efflux. In the presence of human serum albumin, maximal sterol efflux occurred with phospholipids having two adjacent acyl chains and zero net charge; sterol release decreased as net charge increased."

https://openalex.org/W1599884201,"The nucleotide requirements for microtubule assembly following two different methods of nucleotide removal were defined. Microtubular protein extracted with charcoal in a buffer containing 1 mM EDTA showed an absolute dependence on GTP for assembly, whereas, microtubular protein extracted with charcoal in a buffer containing 1 mM MgCl2 could assemble with the nucleotide analogs, guanosine-5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate (GMP-PNP) and guanosine-5'-(beta-gamma-methylene)triphosphate. Assembly promoted by the nucleotide analogs proceeded at slower rate and to a lesser extent than the assembly induced by GTP. Furthermore, after the analog-induced assembly had reached a steady state level, the addition of GTP immediately induced further tubulin assembly to the level produced by GTP alone. Microtubules assembled with GMP-PNP or GTP contained approximately 2.8 mol of bound nucleotide per mol of dimer. The two different methods of charcoal extraction produced microtubular protein preparations that differed in their residual nucleotide and Mg2+ content. The EDTA-charcoal-extracted microtubular protein retained 1 mol of tightly bound nucleotide (GDP) and 1 mol of Mg2+ per mol of dimer, whereas, the Mg2+ charcoal-extracted microtubular protein retained 1.4 mol of bound nucleotide (1.0 mol of GDP + 0.4 mol of GTP) and 1.5 mol of Mg2+ per mol of dimer. The results suggest that only that fraction of tubulin subunits containing bound GTP can assemble with the nucleotide analogs and that microtubules may possess a third or polymer binding site for nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1559620970,"A new assay was developed for measuring the stimulation of intercellular adhesion of rat hepatocytes by rat liver plasma membranes. Aggregates formed in the presence of the membranes are separated from single cells by filtration, and the number of cells in the aggregates is determined by their lactate dehydrogenase content. The formation of aggregates was specifically stimulated by rat liver plasma membranes and the rate of aggregate formation was proportional to the quantity of added membranes. The effects of divalent cations on the initial rates of rat and chicken hepatocytes adhesion were also examined. Optimal rates of adhesion of rat hepatocytes were obtained in the presence of physiological levels of Mg2+, and adhesion was inhibited by Ca2+, whereas optimal rates of chicken hepatocyte adhesion were obtained in the presence of physiological levels of Ca2+. Plasma membrane stimulation of hepatocyte adhesion also showed the same divalent ion requirements with the respective cell types. The stimulatory activity in the rat plasma membranes determined by the filter assay was found to be sensitive both to trypsin digestion and to mild periodate oxidation. The activity was also completely resistant to vigorous reductive alkylation. These results taken together suggest that the rat plasma membrane stimulatory activity is associated with a glycoprotein(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1500139850,"The topography of 5.8 rRNA in rat liver ribosomes has been examined by comparing diethyl pyrocarbonate-reactive sites in free 5.8 S RNA, the 5.8 S-28 rRNA complex, 60 S subunits, and whole ribosomes. The ribosomal components were treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate under salt and temperature conditions which allow cell-free protein synthesis; the 5.8 S rRNA was extracted, labeled in vitro, chemically cleaved with aniline, and the fragments were analyzed by rapid gel-sequencing techniques. Differences in the cleavage patterns of free and 28 S or ribosome-associated 5.8 S rRNA suggest that conformational changes occur when this molecule is assembled into ribosomes. In whole ribosomes, the reactive sites were largely restricted to the AU-rich stem and an increased reactivity at some of the nucleotides suggested that a major change occurs in this region when the RNA interacts with ribosomal proteins. The reactivity was generally much less restricted in 60 S subunits but increased reactivity in some residues was also observed. The results further indicate that in rat ribosomes, the two -G-A-A-C- sequences, putative binding sites for tRNA, are accessible in 60 S subunits but not in whole ribosomes and suggest that part of the molecule may be located in the ribosomal interface. When compared to 5 S rRNA, the free 5.8 S RNA molecule appears to be generally more reactive with diethyl pyrocarbonate and the cleavage patterns suggest that the 5 S RNA molecule is completely restricted or buried in whole ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1653866391,"The nature and distribution of the covalently bound phosphate of human fibronectin have been investigated. Phosphate was detected only as phosphoserine and is not present on asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Fibroblast fibronectin labeled with 3H-amino acids and [32P]orthophosphate was subjected to limited tryptic digestion. Initial cleavages which reduced the molecule to nondisulfide-bonded polypeptides of Mr approximately 210,000-220,000 did not entail the loss of phosphate. Subsequent cleavage products included intermediate-sized 32P-phosphopeptides (43,000 and 37,000), but all 32P label became increasingly associated with lower molecular weight material (13,000 and 9,000) eventually terminating in a phosphopeptide (or peptides) of Mr approximately 6,000. The phosphorylated region(s) of human fibronectin are apparently not located at the extreme COOH-terminal region containing the interchain disulfide bond, but seem to be within a 40,000-50,000 segment near one end of the molecule. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of 32P-labeled fibronectin isolated from fibroblast culture medium produced one major phosphopeptide (Mr approximately 5,000) which co-purified through two chromatographic procedures with a CNBr phosphopeptide derived from plasma fibronectin. The phosphorylation of fibronectin is evidently restricted to a small region of the protein molecule, implying a very site-specific event. The phosphorylated region is present on human fibronectins obtained from plasma, fibroblast surfaces, and fibroblast culture medium, indicating that the role of the phosphate may be important to all forms of fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1557256448,"Individual anomeric protons that are unresolved in the one-dimensional 250-MHz spectra of oligomannosidic glycopeptides can be separated and characterized by two-dimensional J-resolved NMR spectroscopy. Homogeneous preparations of ovalbumin glycopeptides Man6GlcNAc2Asn and Man5GlcNAc2Asn were characterized by chemical methods, conventional proton NMR, and two-dimensional J-resolved NMR. Due to characteristic differences in coupling constants, mannose (J1,2 less than or equal to 2 Hz) and N-acetylglucosamine (J1,2 approximately 9 Hz) anomeric signals of similar chemical shift were readily separated and identified in the two-dimensional spectra. It is shown that two-dimensional J-resolved NMR spectroscopy, in combination with conventional NMR and limited chemical analysis, is a rapid and reliable technique for the determination of glycopeptide primary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1577080785,"The kinetics of the polymerization of human monoclonal cryoimmunoglobulins at low temperature was investigated in temperature jump experiments by monitoring the changes in turbidity resulting from the scattering of incident light by the polymers. Above a critical concentration between 2 and 3 mg/ml, depending on the ionic strength, the kinetics were characterized by a concentration-dependent lag phase and initial rate of self-assembly. Under equilibrium conditions which favored polymerization, the only stable intermediate detected by analytical ultracentrifugation was the dimer. Although purified monomers were unable to self-associate at 4 degrees C, addition of trace amounts of autologous dimers promoted polymerization. The apparent rate of polymerization was shown to be slow (k = 4.7 X 10(-4) M-1 s-1), and the process was governed by an equilibrium constant of 4.6 X 10(4) M-1. The initial rate of self-assembly was proportional to the product of the monomer concentration and the concentration of promoter (i.e. dimer). The rate of depolymerization was three orders of magnitude greater than the rate of polymerization and was proportional to the concentration of polymers present. These results suggest that the polymerization of monoclonal cryoimmunoglobulins is a nucleation-controlled process in which dimerization is the rate-limiting step. Kinetic studies on the polymerization of Fab and F(ab')2 fragments from cryoimmunoglobulins and a comparison of cryogel ultrastructure by electron microscopy suggested that the interaction site between monomers is located in the Fab region. Since the polymerization of monomers was only induced by autologous dimers and not dimers from other cryoimmunoglobulins, it was concluded that the hypervariable regions play a specific role in the condensation reaction. The fact that one cryoimmunoglobulin has a well defined antibody activity against streptolysin O argued against a low temperature-induced auto-anti-idiotype mechanism. Reduction of the interchain disulfide bonds of the Fab fragments abolished their ability to polymerize, probably by inducing a conformational change a considerable distance away in the variable domains of the molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1523898168,"Chemical modification with diethylpyrocarbonate (ethoxyformic anhydride) was examined to demonstrate the existence of an essential histidine residue at the NADPH-binding site of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2) from Pseudomonas desmolytica. Among some ligands, NADPH was noticeable in protecting the enzyme from the modification-caused inactivation. Although several amino acid residues were modified during the inactivation process, inhibition of the enzyme could be correlated with modification of a single histidine residue which was masked by addition of NADPH. The pK of the essential histidine residue was estimated to be 6.5-6.7. The Kd (Km) for NADPH of the inactivated enzyme was shown to have been increased greatly, although the Kd for substrate (p-hydroxybenzoate) was not changed."

https://openalex.org/W1504594775,"25-Hydroxy-24-oxovitamin D3 (25(OH)24-oxo-D3), a metabolite of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, has been chemically synthesized. The ultraviolet, mass, infrared, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the 25(OH)24-oxo-D3 were identical with those of the natural product isolated from chick kidney incubates. The oxo compound showed biological activity similar to 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25(OH)2D3) in vitamin D-deficient chicks in enhancing intestinal calcium transport and bone calcium mobilization activities. Although 25(OH)24-oxo-D3 partially restored the impaired eggshell weights of Japanese quails fed a vitamin D-deficient diet, it was much less potent than 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 or 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In addition, there was no effect on the calcification of medullary bone. When 25(OH)24-oxo[3H]D3 was incubated with kidney homogenates from vitamin D-deficient chicks, it was metabolized to [3H]1 alpha, 24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 and a metabolite which was eluted in a region between authentic 24R,25(OH)2D3 and 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on high pressure liquid chromatography. In the incubates of kidney homogenates from vitamin D-supplemented chicks, those metabolites were not detected. In vitamin D-supplemented chicks, the recovery of radioactivity in the chloroform phase extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer was only 50%, while that in vitamin D-deficient chicks was 87%. Moreover, the radioactivity eluted in the 25(OH)24-oxo-D3 fraction from vitamin D-supplemented chicks was only one-fifth of that from vitamin D-deficient birds. The present results indicate that the 24-oxidation of 24,25(OH)2D3 may be a route of inactivation of vitamin D3."
https://openalex.org/W1587744769,"Glycerol metabolism in 9 defined parts of rat nephron was studied by measurement of glycerol kinase and observation of effects of large glycerol loads on related metabolites and on ATP and total adenylate. Glycerol kinase with glycerol as substrate was highest in the proximal convoluted tubule, slightly lower in straight portions, 20 to 25 times lower in distal segments, and almost indetectable elsewhere. With dihydroxyacetone as substrate, enzyme distribution differed little except for 30% lower activity in proximal convoluted segments. Methods of measurement with 10-40 ng of freeze-dried tissue are described. Glycerol loads produced large accumulations of glycerol 3-phosphate in proximal segments and in distal convoluted tubules. In the control nephron, fructose bisphosphate plus triose phosphates was 1 times higher in distal straight and convoluted segments than in proximal segments. Increases with glycerol loads were limited to proximal straight tubules (2-fold) and the thin limb area (60%). Glucose-6-P increased 3-fold in the late portion of the proximal straight tubule but not elsewhere. ATP and total adenylate were markedly depleted no phosphorylated intermediates accumulated. Levels of Pi were decreased in whole cortex and medullar following glycerol loads."
https://openalex.org/W2142084680,"As a result of continued incubation of cultured L-929 fibroblasts in growth medium containing excess NaCl, protein synthesis became resistant to the inhibitory effect of hypertonic medium. Protein synthesis became progressively resistant in a linear fashion during the first 6 h of incubation. The level of resistance attained was directly related to the concentration of excess NaCl to which the cells were exposed during the incubation period. Actinomycin D did not prevent the expression of resistance, indicating that de novo synthesis of RNA is not required. Finally, resistance declined to near the preinduction level by 4 h after resistance cells were returned to isotonic medium."
