https://openalex.org/W1978274173,"Recent studies have revealed that the hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase system is far more complicated than originally suspected-consisting of at least three types of proteins embedded in the lipids of the plasma membrane. This complex of proteins has the ability to receive information from several sources and generate a single, integrated response. The decision-making process begins when receptors for a large number of hormones, neurotransmitters, and other regulatory molecules interact with appropriate endogenous ligands and with drugs at the cell surface. These interactions ultimately result in stimulation or inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity; there are subsequent alterations of intracellular phosphorylation as a consequence of the actions of CAMP-dependent protein krnases and counter-regulatory phosphoprotein phosphatases. Stimulatory receptors include those for P-adrenergic agonists, ACTH, gonadotropins, and many others, while Inhibitory control is exerted by such agents as a*-adrenergic and muscarinic agonists and opioids. Receptors communicate with a pair of homologous guanine-nucleotide-brnding regulatory proteins-one (G,) mediates stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, while the other (G,) is responsible for inhibition. The G proteins control the activity of the actual catalyst of the enzyme system (C) in a complex series of reactions discussed below. Notable in this scheme is the fact that the two G proteins share a common subunit, and the action of this subunit appears to be crucial for the integrative capacity of the system. The G proteins that regulate adenylate cyclase activity are members of a larger family of homologous guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins that includes transducin, a regulatory protein of the outer segment of the retinal rod. The products of the ras genes may also be relatrves. Progress in dissection of the hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase system was slow through the 1960s and much of the 1970s for a number of valid, and for some time unsuspected, reasons. These include the hydrophobic nature of the components: their multiplicity, lability, and extremely low concentration (1 part in 1 O5 of cell protein is typrcal); and the need for proper orientation of the components in an appropriate membrane for hormonal regulation of enzymatic activity. However, a number of advances have now led to a successful path of experimentation. It is clear that detailed understanding of the mechanism of regulation of CAMP synthesis will soon be achieved from study of the interactions of purified components that have been reconstituted in lipid bilayers of defined composition. G. and G, The two guanine-nucleotide-binding regulatory components of the adenylate cyclase system have been purified and studied in some detail-particularly in detergent-containing solutions (Sternweis et al., JBC 256, 11517-l 1526, 1981; Bokoch et al., JBC 258, 2072-2075, 1983). The table and two figures are included to facilitate the following discussron. The catalyst of adenylate cyclase is essentially inactive with its physiological substrate, MgATP, in the absence of G,. G, is thus most conveniently assayed by its ability to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity; the best source of C for such an assay is obviously one that is free of G,. Such resolved preparations of C can be made biochemically. Alternatively, the membrane of the cycS49 lymphoma cell mutant IS a superb assay vehicle. This mutant is deficient in G, activity, but retains C, and was particularly useful for elucidating the importance and activity of G,. It was originally assumed that cycwas devoid of adenylate cyclase, since it had essentially undetectable levels of this enzymatic activity. However, addition of G, to cycmembranes fully restores adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by hormone, guanine nucleotide, and fluoride. G, has an oligomeric structure with 45,000 and 35,000 dalton subunits, while G, has a similar structure with 41,000 and 35,000 dalton subunits. A third subunit, M, 10,000, also appears to be present in both proteins, although this has not been proved rigorously. The larger (a) subunit of each protein contains a site for NAD-dependent ADPribosylation catalyzed by a bacterial toxin. Cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates G,,, in the presence of a membrane-bound protein cofactor (ARF), while islet-activating protein (IAP; one of the toxins of Bordetella pertussis) ADP-ribosylates G,.,. Such ADP-ribosylation results in characteristic modificatlons of the function of each regulatory protein. The (Y subunits of each G protein also contain a site with highaffinity for guanine-nucleotide binding. The 35,000 dalton (@) subunits of G, and G, are indistinguishable from each other functionally (see below) and by analysis of amino acid composition and maps of proteolytic peptides. Incubation of either G, or G, with nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotides (e.g. GTPyS) or with fluoride (in the presence of Mg2+ and A$+; see Sternweis and Gilman, PNAS 79, 4888-4891, 1982) results in “activation” of the protein. By activation I mean a state in which the protein is capable of either stimulating or inhibiting the activity of C. In fact, activation of either G, or G, by GTPyS is essentially irreversible (in the presence of Mg’+); free GTPrS can be removed, and the activated state is stable. Activation of either G, or G, has been shown to be the result of or associated with ligand-promoted dissociation of the protein’s subunits, as follows (Northup et al., JBC 258, 11369-I 1376, 1983; Katada et al., JBC, in press):"
https://openalex.org/W1553799143,"The Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (C-kinase) binds tightly in the presence of Ca2+ to purified membranes of A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. The major membrane substrate for C-kinase is the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Phosphorylation of the EGF receptor is Ca2+-dependent and occurs at threonine and serine residues. After tryptic digestion of the receptor, three major phosphothreonine-containing peptides were identified. These are identical with three new phosphopeptides present in the EGF receptor isolated from A431 cells treated with either of the tumor promoters 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate or teleocidin. C-kinase catalyzes phosphorylation at these same sites in purified EGF receptor protein. These results indicate that, in A431 cells exposed to tumor promoters, C-kinase catalyzes phosphorylation of a significant population of EGF receptor molecules. This phosphorylation of EGF receptors results in decreased self-phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at tyrosine residues both in vivo and in vitro and in decreased EGF-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1490198587,"When human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells labeled with 32Pi to steady state specific activity were treated either with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or with active phorbol ester tumor promoters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, labeling of 160 kDa EGF receptors isolated by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-EGF receptor IgG was increased 2- to 3-fold. These treatments produced no significant increase in 32Pi labeling of acid-precipitable material present in detergent extracts of the cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis of radiolabeled EGF receptors isolated from these cells revealed several differences: the relative abundance of phosphotyrosine in EGF receptors was increased in cells treated with EGF, but decreased in cells treated with TPA; the overall relative abundance of phosphothreonine in EGF receptors was decreased in cells treated with EGF, but remained constant within the limits of experimental detection in cells treated with TPA. Two-dimensional mapping of the radiolabeled phosphopeptides produced from EGF receptors isolated by immunoprecipitation and treated with trypsin revealed 9 independent labeled regions, 2 of which contained phosphothreonine and were present only in EGF- or TPA-treated cells. These two phosphopeptide regions were more highly labeled in cells treated with TPA than with EGF."
https://openalex.org/W1579931350,"Free radical reactions involved in the metabolism of carbon tetrachloride by rat liver have been considered to be a cause of at least part of the injury resulting from exposure to this halocarbon. In an earlier study employing electron spin resonance and spin-trapping techniques, we demonstrated that trichloromethyl (13.CCl3) radicals are readily observed in rat liver microsomes metabolizing 13CCl4, and that the same radical could be shown to form in vivo in the liver of intact rats given a single dose of 13CCl4. This report describes the production of lipid dienyl (L.) and oxygen-centered lipid radicals (LO. or LOO., or both) in in vitro systems metabolizing 13CCl4, and also the formation of lipid dienyl radicals (L.) in liver of intact animals exposed to CCl4. The radicals appear to be produced in a sequence of reactions governed among other things by the oxygen tension in the system. The lipid radicals (L.) which form in intact liver of CCl4-treated rats are apparently the result of an attack on lipids of the endoplasmic reticulum by 13.CCl3 radicals formed by reductive cleavage to CCl4 and are the initial intermediates in the process of lipid peroxidation. These investigations demonstrate that while the events occurring in liver microsomes in vitro appear to parallel those which take place in intact liver in vivo, the conditions in vivo make the spin-trapping studies of radicals in intact animals much more selective than it is in vitro for a given spin trap, and requires the use of more than one type of spin-trapping agent to detect different radical species in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1525552603,"Leukotriene B5 (LTB5) and three stereoisomers were prepared biosynthetically from eicosapentaenoic acid and compared with the analogous derivatives of arachidonic acid for their chemotactic and aggregating effects on human neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), LTB5, and the 6-trans-diastereoisomers of each were generated by activating polymorphonuclear leukocytes with the calcium ionophore A23187 in the presence of 14C-labeled and unlabeled arachidonic acid or 14C-labeled and unlabeled eicosapentaenoic acid, respectively. The double lipoxygenase products, (5S,12S)-6-trans-8-cis-LTB4 and (5S,12S)-6-trans-8-cis-LTB5, were generated from 5S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and racemic 5-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid intermediates by incubation with platelet sonicates. The products of each reaction were isolated by reverse-phase-high performance liquid chromatography and identified by their retention times relative to the appropriate totally synthetic standards, ultraviolet absorption spectra, immunoreactivity in a radioimmunoassay for LTB4, and, for all but the double lipoxygenase products, by incorporation of radiolabel from the specific polyunsaturated fatty acid source. When the concentration of LTB5 eliciting maximum chemotactic response of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 50 ng/ml (1.5 X 10(-7) M), and that eliciting a maximum aggregation response, 20 ng/ml (5.9 X 10(-8) M), were compared with the interpolated values of LTB4 eliciting comparable effects, the potency of LTB5 relative to LTB4 was approximately 1:8 as a chemotactic agent and about 1:20 as an aggregating agent. The double lipoxygenase products and the resolved 6-trans-diastereoisomers of the pentaene and tetraene series were about 2 logs less active as chemotactic factors than LTB4 and only (5S,12S)-6-trans-8-cis-LTB4 had even minimal aggregating activity."
https://openalex.org/W2141817909,"Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) convert arachidonic acid (20:4) to a number of dihydroxy metabolites, including leukotriene B4 (LTB4) 5S,12R-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-EEEZ-icosatetraenoic acid (isomer-1), 5S,12S-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-EEEZ-icosatetraenoic acid, 5S,12S-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-EZEZ-icosatetraenoic acid (5S,12S-dh-20:4), 5,6-dihydroxy-7,9,11,14-icosatetraenoic acid, and 5,15-dihydroxy-6,8,11,13-icosatetraenoic acid. LTB4 was synthesized rapidly after stimulation of PMNL with the divalent cation ionophore, A23187, but its concentration rapidly declined after about 4 min, in contrast to the other dihydroxy metabolites of 20:4 whose concentrations remained stable for at least 20 min. The amounts of polar metabolites (identified primarily as 20-hydroxy-LTB4) increased steadily with time up to 20 min. These results suggest that LTB4 may be specifically converted to its 20-hydroxy metabolite by PMNL. We prepared 3H- and 14C-labeled analogs of the dihydroxyicosatetraenoic acid metabolites described above by incubation of labeled 20:4 with PMNL. Although all of these substances were metabolized to some extent by human PMNL, LTB4 (apparent Km, 1.0 microM) was metabolized the most rapidly, followed by 5S,12S-dh-20:4 (apparent Km, 2.4 microM) and isomer-1 (apparent Km, 4.8 microM). All three substrates were shown by mass spectrometry to be converted to their 20-hydroxy metabolites. LTB4 was also metabolized to its omega-carboxy derivative. Human mononuclear leukocytes and rabbit PMNL metabolized LTB4 very slowly, whereas rat PMNL metabolized this substrate at about one-sixth the rate of human PMNL. These results demonstrate that human PMNL contain an omega-hydroxylase that specifically converts LTB4 to its 20-hydroxy metabolite. This enzyme may be important for the regulation of LTB4 levels in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1508955850,"Abstract The subunit composition of the Ns and Ni, the human erythrocyte stimulatory and inhibitory regulatory proteins of adenylyl cyclase, respectively, were analyzed by a sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing discontinuous urea and polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis system designed for the study of low molecular weight polypeptides. This system disclosed that these proteins, in addition to their known alpha and beta subunits, contain an additional small of apparent molecular weight of 5,000 (5K). This peptide is also present in preparations of another which we termed 40K protein on the basis of its hydrodynamic behavior and whose primary constituent is the Mr 35,000 beta subunit of the above regulatory proteins. Analyzing Ni, the 5K was functionally related to the by showing that its apparent Stokes radius changes from 5.9 to 5.1 nm after treatment with guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate and magnesium in parallel with the alpha and beta subunits. These data are interpreted as evidence for the existence of a third subunit associated with the regulatory proteins of adenylyl cyclase. We call this subunit gamma and propose a minimum subunit structure for these proteins of the alpha beta gamma type."
https://openalex.org/W1594677530,"In studies on the cause of the extreme stability of the macromolecules of Thermus thermophilus HB8, the leuB gene coding for 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase of the leucine synthesis pathway and its flanking regions were cloned and sequenced. The leuB gene of T. thermophilus was expressed in a leuB-less mutant of Escherichia coli, and thermostable dehydrogenase was purified from an extract of the cells. The primary structure of the thermophilic isopropylmalate dehydrogenase was deduced from the nucleotide sequence leuB gene (1017 base pairs) and the amino acid sequence of the peptides isolated from the purified dehydrogenase. The thermophilic dehydrogenase has Mr = 35,968, and the value was close to that determined for the monomer of dehydrogenase (36,000) by gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of active dimeric dehydrogenase was found to be 73,000 by high speed liquid chromatography. The primary structure of dehydrogenase was consistent with the amino acid composition of the dehydrogenase. In contrast to the isopropylmalate dehydrogenase of E. coli which contains 8 cysteine residues, there was no cysteine in thermophilic isopropylmalate dehydrogenase. The 5'-noncoding region contained a typical Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The guanine plus cytosine content of the coding region was 70.1%, and that of the third letter of the codons was extremely high (89.4%)."
https://openalex.org/W2018476644,"Tc 1 transposable elements in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans undergo excision at high frequency. We show here that this excision occurs primarily or entirely in the somatic tissues of the organism. Absence of germ-line excision is demonstrated by showing that Tc 1 elements are genetically stable; elements at particular genomic sites, as well as the overall number of elements in the genome, were stably maintained during a year of continuous, nonselective propagation. Somatic excision is demonstrated by showing that empty Tc 1 sites arise during a single generation of growth of a synchronous population and are not inherited by the next generation. These results suggest that excision of Tc 1 elements is under the control of tissue-specific factors."

However, many mature T cells infected with human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus grow independently of exogenously added TCGF. It is now reported that cells infected with this virus also lack detectable TCGF messenger RNA (less than one copy per cell) and thus do not produce their own growth factor. The results apparently rule out an autostimulation mechanism of growth control."
https://openalex.org/W1516240255,The EPR spectra of the cytochromes in ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (Complex III) have peaks at g = 3.78 (cytochrome b566) g = 3.45 (cytochrome b562) and g = 3.35 (cytochrome c1). The highly asymmetric peak of cytochrome b566 has been simulated using an arbitrary gaussian distribution of crystal field parameters. The asymmetry is due to the nonlinear relationship between field position and crystal field. The results suggest that the b cytochromes have bis-imidazole ligation. The gz peak of cytochrome c1 was also found to be asymmetric; simulations suggest histidine-methionine ligation. No other important cytochrome components were needed to simulate the spectrum of the oxidized complex; these results are consistent with 1:1:1 stoichiometry of components. These results argue against any asymmetric dimer model for Complex III.
https://openalex.org/W1495030769,"The inositol phospholipids of peritoneal macrophages were prelabeled with [3H]inositol to enable studies on the enzymatic mechanisms of stimulus-induced phosphatidylinositol breakdown. Ionophore A23187 induced a rapid breakdown of phosphatidylinositol in the presence of Ca2+ with 25% loss occurring within 5 min. The main water-soluble product of this breakdown was identified as inositol diphosphate. Since the accumulation of inositol diphosphate far exceeded the concomitant decrease in polyphosphoinositides, an increased phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol must have preceded, or accompanied, the degradation of diphosphoinositide. The degradation of phosphatidylinositol induced by A23187 was shown to be strictly dependent on Ca2+. The monovalent cation ionophore monensin and platelet-activating factor increased the level of diphosphoinositide but caused no net degradation of inositol phospholipids. The same effect was seen with ionophore A23187 in the absence of Ca2+. Zymosan particles also induced extensive degradation of phosphatidylinositol. Products of phosphodiesterase-catalyzed cleavage of inositol lipids were observed, but the pathway of deacylation dominated as evidenced by the accumulation of lysophosphatidylinositol and glycerophosphoinositol. Deacylation was also enhanced in response to concanavalin A. Thus, in mouse peritoneal macrophages phosphatidylinositol breakdown occurred primarily by deacylation or via diphosphoinositide, depending on the stimulus, rather than through a phosphatidylinositol phosphodiesterase reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1626137351,"Multiplication-stimulating activity (MSA) stimulates the uptake of xylose and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) by intact rat soleus muscle. It is approximately 50 times less potent than insulin. A native insulin receptor species with apparent Mr = 350,000 in soleus muscle is revealed by affinity cross-linking to 125I-insulin with disuccinimidyl suberate. 125I-labeled insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I with the cross-linker affinity labels two native receptor types with Mr = 360,000 (type I) and Mr = 220,000 (type II). In order to distinguish which of the three insulin and IGF receptor systems identified mediate the rapid insulin-like effects of MSA, the biological actions of the unlabeled ligands at various concentrations were correlated with their ability to inhibit the affinity labeling of these receptor species. The stimulatory action of native insulin is closely related to its ability to inhibit the labeling of the insulin receptor by 125I-insulin such that the uptake of xylose and AIB is maximally stimulated when 80% of insulin receptor 125I-affinity labeling is inhibited. In contrast, MSA only displaced 16% of the 125I-labeling of the insulin receptor when it maximally stimulates the uptake of xylose and AIB, indicating that the insulin receptor is not primarily involved in mediating these effects. The affinity of MSA to the type II IGF receptor is 10 times higher than that to the type I IGF receptor. There is close to a 1:1 relationship between the stimulatory effects of MSA on xylose and AIB uptake and its inhibitory action on the affinity labeling of the type I receptor by 125I-IGF I. In contrast, MSA almost abolishes the labeling of the type II IGF receptor at concentrations which have no detectable effects on the uptake of xylose and AIB by soleus muscle. Thus, a marked dissociation can be observed between the rapid insulin-like action of MSA and its inhibitory effects on the affinity labeling of the type II receptor by 125I-IGF I. We conclude that MSA acts through the type I IGF receptor in soleus muscle to stimulate hexose and amino acid transport. The type II IGF receptor appears to be incapable of modulating these effects in this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1513576040,"Previous studies have shown that phosphorylase phosphatase can be isolated from rabbit liver and bovine heart as a form of Mr approximately 35,000 after an ethanol treatment of tissue extracts. This enzyme form was designated as protein phosphatase C. In the present study, reproducible methods for the isolation of two forms of protein phosphatase C from rabbit skeletal muscle to apparent homogeneity are described. Protein phosphatase C-I was obtained in yields of up to 20%, with specific activities toward phosphorylase a of 8,000-16,000 units/mg of protein. This enzyme represents the major phosphorylase phosphatase activity present in the ethanol-treated muscle extracts. The second enzyme, protein phosphatase C-II, had a much lower specific activity toward phosphorylase a (250-900 units/mg). Phosphatase C-I and phosphatase C-II had Mr = 32,000 and 33,500, respectively, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis. The two enzymes displayed distinct enzymatic properties. Phosphatase C-II was associated with a more active alkaline phosphatase activity toward p-nitrophenyl phosphate than was phosphatase C-I. Phosphatase C-II activities were activated by Mn2+, whereas phosphatase C-I was inhibited. Phosphatase C-I was inhibited by rabbit skeletal muscle inhibitor 2 while phosphatase C-II was not inhibited. Both enzymes dephosphorylated glycogen synthase and phosphorylase kinase, but displayed different specificities toward the alpha- and beta-subunit phosphates of phosphorylase kinase (Ganapathi, M. K., Silberman, S. R., Paris, H., and Lee, E. Y. C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 3213-3217). The amino acid compositions of the two proteins were similar. Peptide mapping of the two proteins showed that they are distinct proteins and do not have a precursor-proteolytic product relationship."
https://openalex.org/W1520830512,"Abstract Adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) kinase, the second enzyme in the pathway of inorganic sulfate assimilation, was purified to near homogeneity from mycelium of the filamentous fungus, Penicillium chrysogenum. The enzyme has a native molecular weight of 59,000-60,000 and is composed of two 30,000-dalton subunits. At 30 degrees C, pH 8.0 (0.1 M Tris-chloride buffer), 5.5 microM APS, 5 mM MgATP, 5 mM excess MgCl2, and high salt (70-150 mM (NH4)2SO4), the most highly purified preparation has a specific activity of 24.7 units X mg of protein-1 in the physiological direction of adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) formation. This activity is nearly 100-fold higher than that of any previously purified preparation of APS kinase. APS kinase is subject to potent substrate inhibition by APS. In the absence of added salt, the initial velocity at 5 mM MgATP plus 5 mM Mg2+ is maximal at about 1 microM APS and half-maximal at 0.2 and 4.4 microM APS. In the presence of 200 mM NaCl or 70-150 mM (NH4)2SO4, the optimum APS concentration shifts to 4-6 microM APS; the half-maximal values shift to 1-1.3 and 21-27 microM APS. The steady state kinetics of the reaction were investigated using a continuous spectrophotometric assay. The families of reciprocal plots in the range 0.25-5 mM MgATP and 0.8-5.1 microM APS are linear and intersect on the horizontal axis. Appropriate replots yield KmMgATP = 1.5 mM, KmAPS = 1.4 microM, and Vmax, = 38.7 units X mg of protein-1. Excess APS is an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to MgATP (K1APS = 23 microM). PAPS, the product of the forward reaction, is also uncompetitive with MgATP. PAPS is not competitive with APS. In the reverse direction, the plots have the characteristics of a rapid equilibrium ordered sequence with MgADP adding before PAPS. The kinetic constants are KmPAPS = 8 microM, KiMgADP = 560 microM, and Vmaxr = 0.16 units X mg of protein-1. Iso-PAPS (the 2'-phosphate isomer of PAPS) is competitive with PAPS and uncompetitive with respect to MgADP (Ki = 6 microM). APS kinase is inactivated by phenylglyoxal, suggesting the involvement of an essential argininyl residue. MgATP or MgADP at 10 Ki protect against inactivation. APS or PAPS at 600 and 80 Km, respectively, are ineffective alone, but provide nearly complete protection in the presence of 0.1 Ki of MgADP or MgATP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

L., Paulsen, P. V., and Betts, R. E. (1977) Plant Physiol. 59, 907-910) was found to be a potent inhibitor of calmodulin-activated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. The physiologically less active analogue, 3-anhydro-ophiobolin A, was found to be less inhibitory than ophiobolin A in the phosphodiesterase assay. The direct interaction between ophiobolin A and calmodulin has been demonstrated by changes in fluorescence of the protein and by the effect of ophiobolin A on calmodulin activity upon preincubation. Addition of ophiobolin A to calmodulin solutions resulted in an instantaneous quenching of the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence followed by a time-dependent quenching. The instantaneous quenching is probably due to the inner filtering effect of ophiobolin A. The time-dependent fluorescence quenching was correlated with a time-dependent inhibition of calmodulin upon preincubation with ophiobolin A. The inhibition of calmodulin by ophiobolin A could not be reversed by dialysis, dilution, nor denaturation by urea in the presence of methanol followed by renaturation, and was much more pronounced in solutions containing Ca2+ than in those containing EGTA. Ophiobolin A also was shown to inhibit spinach calmodulin. The results of the present study suggest that calmodulin may be one of the target proteins of the phytotoxic action of ophiobolin A and that the interaction of ophiobolin A with calmodulin may involve a covalent modification of the protein by the fungal metabolite."

There was a dramatic increase in the stem cell (CFU-S) compartment and the committed progenitor cell (GM-CFC) compartment and a decrease in mature granulocytes. The altered balance appears to be caused by intrinsic alterations in the CFU-S and GM-CFC themselves, which increase their ""self-renewal"" capacity at the expense of cell differentiation.

After 19-h exposure to an inducer, the cells could not resume myeloperoxidase synthesis on further incubation in inducer-free medium. When polysomes and mRNAs prepared from untreated and treated cells were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, the former showed myeloperoxidase polypeptide synthesis, and the latter did not. These results indicate that the inability of induced cells to synthesize myeloperoxidase is due to the absence of myeloperoxidase mRNA."

In the absence of light, this ligand binds with high affinity (KD = 130 pM) in a reversible and saturable manner to sites in rat hepatic plasma membranes. The binding is stereoselective and competitively inhibited by adrenergic agonists and antagonists with an alpha 1-adrenergic specificity. Upon photolysis, this ligand incorporates irreversibly into plasma membranes prepared from several mammalian tissues including rat liver, rat, guinea pig, and rabbit spleen, rabbit lung, and rabbit aorta vascular smooth muscle cells, also with typical alpha 1-adrenergic specificity. Autoradiograms of such membrane samples subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveal a major specifically labeled polypeptide at Mr = 78,000-85,000, depending on the tissue used, in addition to some lower molecular weight peptides. Protease inhibitors, in particular EDTA, a metalloprotease inhibitor, dramatically increases the predominance of the Mr = 78,000-85,000 polypeptide while attenuating the labeling of the lower molecular weight bands.

These can be taken as thermodynamic upper limits to the ATP/Sites 1 + 2, ATP/Site 3, and ATP/O stoichiometry of 3-hydroxybutyrate-supported oxidative phosphorylation. The theory of linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics were employed to estimate lower limits to the ATP/site stoichiometries. The lower limit is given by the expression, q2(-delta GRsite/delta GP). The degree of coupling, q, was 0.977 as determined from the dependence of respiratory rate on delta GP. Determined in this way, lower limits of the ATP/Sites 1 + 2, ATP/Site 3, and ATP/O stoichiometries were 1.67, 1.44, and 3.11, respectively. ADP addition to mitochondria incubated at static head lowered delta GP by 1.1 kcal/mol and stimulated respiration by a factor of about 2.5 but caused negligible changes in delta GR1 + 2 and delta GR3. This observation demonstrates that the respiratory reactions from substrate to cytochrome c and from cytochrome c to oxygen both move away from thermodynamic equilibrium with delta GP during the transition from resting to active oxidative phosphorylation. The findings are discussed in terms of current schemes of chemiosmotic coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1517273307,"Two cardiac myosin heavy chain cDNA clones, pMHC alpha 252 and pMHC beta 174, were constructed using rabbit ventricular mRNA isolated from adult thyrotoxic and normal hearts, respectively. The complete DNA sequences of the 2.2- and 1.4-kilobase inserts of pMHC beta 174 and pMHC alpha 252, respectively, were obtained. The 736 amino acids specified by pMHC beta 174 begin 439 (1.3 kilobases) residues from the heavy chain NH2 terminus and include a 400-amino acid segment of subfragment 1 and the entire subfragment 2 region. Clone pMHC alpha 252 encodes 465 amino acids encompassing all of subfragment 2 and a portion of light meromyosin. Comparison of these two clones revealed extensive sequence overlap which included 1107 nucleotides specifying a 369-amino acid segment corresponding to subfragment 2. Within this region 78 (7%) base and 32 (8.7%) amino acid mismatches were noted. These differences were clustered within discrete regions, with the subfragment 1/subfragment 2 junctional region being particularly divergent. Structural differences between pMHC alpha 252 and pMHC beta 174 indicate that these two clones represent two similar but distinct myosin heavy chain genes whose expression is responsible for ventricular myosin heavy chain isoforms alpha and beta, respectively. The derived amino acid sequences of both clones exhibit extensive homology (greater than 81%) with sequences obtained by direct analysis of adult rabbit skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain protein. The sequences corresponding to the subfragment 2 region are consistent with an alpha-helical conformation with a characteristic 7-residue periodicity in the linear distribution of nonpolar amino acids. Conversely, subfragment 1 sequences specified by pMHC beta 174 suggest a folded highly irregular structure."
https://openalex.org/W1482559745,"Mannose 6-phosphate is an important recognition site involved in transport of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes. The current study is the first demonstration of functional mannose phosphate receptors in macrophages. The receptor appears to be similar in many respects to that expressed in fibroblasts. Binding at 4 degrees C of a mannose-6-P-containing ligand, alpha-mannosidase from Dictyostelium discoideum, was specific and saturable (KD = 1.6 nM). In the presence of permeabilizing agents (saponin and digitonin), macrophage mannose-6-P receptors gave a distribution of 15-20% on the surface and 80-85% inside. Uptake studies gave a Kuptake value of 4.9 nM. Mannose-6-P, Hansenula holstii phosphomannan, and fructose 1-phosphate were effective inhibitors of alpha-mannosidase uptake. Inhibitors of mannose uptake, such as beta-glucuronidase, mannose-bovine serum albumin, fucose-bovine serum albumin, or mannan had no effect on alpha-mannosidase uptake. Likewise, an inhibitor (fucoidin) of the macrophage receptor which recognizes negatively charged proteins did not inhibit alpha-mannosidase uptake. Uptake was linear over 90 min and inhibited by chloroquine, suggesting that surface receptors recycle. These data demonstrate that macrophages contain receptors which specifically recognize mannose-6-P units and are distinct from the well characterized mannose receptors. The finding that the mannose-6-P receptors play a role at the surface, together with the fact that most of the receptors are intracellular (similar to the mannose receptor) suggests that both carbohydrate receptors play a regulatory role at the surface and intracellularly in transport of lysosomal enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1604935488,"In the human genome there is one expressed gene for argininosuccinate synthetase and 14 pseudogenes. A cDNA coding for human argininosuccinate synthetase was used to screen a human genomic library. Twenty-five unique genomic clones were isolated and extensively characterized. At least seven clones represented processed argininosuccinate synthetase pseudogenes that lost the introns in the expressed gene. Restriction mapping demonstrated that these processed pseudogenes were located in distinct regions of the human genome. Complete nucleotide sequences of two processed pseudogenes, psi AS-1 and psi AS-3, and a partial sequence of psi AS-7 were determined. Both psi AS-1 and psi AS-3 had an adenine-rich region at their 3' end and were flanked by distinct imperfect direct repeats. A comparison of these pseudogene sequences to that of the cDNA demonstrated that psi AS-1 and psi AS-3 were 93% homologous to the cDNA, whereas psi AS-7 was 89% homologous to the cDNA. Therefore, it is estimated that psi AS-1 and psi AS-3 were created 10-11 million years ago, whereas psi AS-7 arose approximately 21 million years ago. We have estimated the evolutionary rate for the expressed argininosuccinate synthetase gene based on the sequences of psi AS-1 and psi AS-3. These data indicate that the expressed argininosuccinate synthetase gene is evolving at a rate similar to that of the beta-globin gene and much faster than the alpha-tubulin gene. Furthermore, a comparison of the sequences of psi AS-1 and psi AS-3 suggests the possibility that these pseudogenes arose from a common intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2072309553,"The effect of hypoxic exposure on various mitochondrial enzymes and on cell mitochondrial genomic content was studied in two types of mammalian cells. Hypoxia depressed the activity of six enzymes to the same degree. The kinetics of depression and of recovery during reexposure to normoxia were statistically similar for three marker enzymes. Despite the global and symmetrical decrease in enzyme activities, mitochondrial DNA remained constant. This suggests either symmetrical loss of mitochondrial enzymes from all mitochondria or complete loss of enzymes from a subpopulation of mitochondria with retention of an intact mitochondrial genome."

Supernatant activity corresponded to the earlier described, cytosolic and specific, bis(5'-guanosyl) tetraphosphatase or dinucleoside tetraphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.17; Lobaton, C. D., Vallejo, C. G., Sillero, A., and Sillero, M. A. G. (1975) Eur. J. Biochem. 50, 495-501). Particulate activity, as extracted with Triton X-100, is composed of two enzymes separable by gel filtration. One of them was a low Km (1 microM Gp4G, 5 microM Ap4A) 22,000-dalton enzyme, strongly inhibited by guanosine 5'-tetraphosphate (Ki = 9 nM), and likely identical to the cytosolic specific enzyme. The other Triton-extracted form was unspecific, with an estimated molecular weight of 150,000 (sucrose gradient) or 450,000 (gel filtration), both in the presence of detergent. Substrate specificity was broad, requiring a nucleoside 5'-phosphoryl residue with a free 3'-hydroxyl group, and acting on 5'-5' and 5'-3' compounds. Km values were 12 microM (Gp4G) and 8 microM (Ap4A). Guanosine 5'-tetraphosphate was a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 2 microM). It required bivalent cations since a residual activity after dialysis was abolished by EDTA and enhanced by Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+. In the absence of other added cations, the enzyme, inhibited by 1 mM EDTA, is fully reactivated by an equimolar amount of Zn2+. The possible identity of this activity with phosphodiesterase I (EC 3.1.4.1; Razzell, W.E. (1963) Methods Enzymol. 6, 236-258) is discussed, and its potential role in the metabolism of dinucleoside tetraphosphates is indicated."
https://openalex.org/W1506397261,"The interaction between the four binding sites (two A sites and two B sites) of the regulatory subunit dimer of protein kinase I (RI2) was studied. The rate of association of c[3H]AMP to site B was slower when site A had already been occupied. Occupation of site A also retarded the rate of dissociation of c[3H]AMP from site B. This site A-B interaction was intrachain since it was observed also for a monomeric fragment of RI2. Thus, each monomer of RI2 must have one A site and one B site. Quantitative analysis of the rate constants for cAMP binding to variously liganded RI2 suggested little or no thermodynamic coupling between site A and B. This conclusion was supported by equilibrium binding data. Occupation of one A site retarded the dissociation of c[3H]AMP from the A site of the other subunit (interchain interaction). The rate kinetic constants as well as equilibrium binding data indicated a positively cooperative site A-A interaction. The interaction between cAMP and either site was enthalphy-driven (25 degrees C), the process being accompanied by a loss of entropy. The thermodynamic parameters did not support the occurrence of an abrupt conformational change at a certain level of ligandation of RI2. Half-maximal saturation of either site occurred at 1-2 nM cAMP (37 degrees C, pH 7.0, 0.15 M KCl). The concentration of RI2 did not detectably influence any binding parameters. Aging of RI2 produced a form with minimally, if at all, altered Mr, but which showed a more rapid release of c[3H]AMP bound to site B."
https://openalex.org/W1585331386,"Reticulocytes contain a nonlysosomal, ATP-dependent system for degrading abnormal proteins and normal proteins during cell maturation. Vanadate, which inhibits several ATPases including the ATP-dependent proteases in Escherichia coli and liver mitochondria, also markedly reduced the ATP-dependent degradation of proteins in reticulocyte extracts. At low concentrations (K1 = 50 microM), vanadate inhibited the ATP-dependent hydrolysis of [3H]methylcasein and denatured 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin, but it did not reduce the low amount of proteolysis seen in the absence of ATP. This inhibition by vanadate was rapid in onset, reversed by dialysis, and was not mimicked by molybdate. Vanadate inhibits proteolysis at an ATP-stimulated step which is independent of the ATP requirement for ubiquitin conjugation to protein substrates. When the amino groups on casein and bovine serum albumin were covalently modified so as to prevent their conjugation to ubiquitin, the derivatized proteins were still degraded by an ATP-stimulated process that was inhibited by vanadate. In addition, vanadate did not reduce the ATP-dependent conjugation of 125I-ubiquitin to endogenous reticulocyte proteins, although it markedly inhibited their degradation. In intact reticulocytes vanadate also inhibited the degradation of endogenous proteins and of abnormal proteins containing amino acid analogs. This effect was rapid and reversible; however, vanadate also reduced protein synthesis and eventually lowered ATP levels in the intact cells. Vanadate (10 mM) has also been reported to decrease intralysosomal proteolysis in hepatocytes. However, in liver extracts this effect on lysosomal proteases required high concentrations of vanadate (K1 = 500 microM) and was also observed with molybdate, unlike the inhibition of ATP-dependent proteolysis in reticulocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1538906823,"The existence of conformers of the sodium- and potassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase has been known for some time, yet their structures remain poorly characterized. In this study, circular dichroism spectroscopy was utilized to assess the secondary structural composition of the enzyme, particularly with regard to the E1 and E2 states that are associated with the presence of Na+ and K+, respectively. Parallel experiments were performed in which highly purified Na/K-ATPase from guinea pig kidney outer medulla was incubated with various cations and then examined by CD. The spectra were corrected for optical effects which arise due to the particulate nature of the membrane-bound protein, and then fit to reference data derived from a set of proteins with known secondary structures. In the peptide backbone region of the spectrum (190-240 nm), significant differences between the E1 and E2 conformers were detected and quantified in terms of the proportions of secondary structures present. An extensive conformational change rather than a small local perturbation must be responsible for the differences observed."
https://openalex.org/W173317236,"The dissimilatory nitrite reductase (cytochrome c,d1) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed at pH 7.5 to catalyze nitrosyl transfer (nitrosation) between [15N]nitrite and several N-nucleophiles or H2 18O, with rate enhancement of the order of 10(8) relative to analogous chemical reactions. The reducing system (ascorbate, N,N,N',N'-tetramethylphenylenediamine) could reduce nitrite (but not NO) enzymatically and had essentially no direct chemical reactivity toward nitrite or NO. The N-nitrosations showed saturation kinetics with respect to the nucleophile and, while exhibiting Vmax values which varied by about 40-fold, nevertheless showed little or no dependence of Vmax on nucleophile pKa. The N-nitrosations and NO-2/H2O-18O exchange required the reducing system, whereas NO/H2O-18O exchange was inhibited by the reducing system. NO was not detected to serve as a nitrosyl donor to N-nucleophiles. These and other kinetic observations suggest that the enzymatic nitrosyl donor is an enzyme-bound species derived from reduced enzyme and one molecule of nitrite, possibly a heme-nitrosyl compound (E-FeII X NO+) for which there is precedence. Nitrosyl transfer to N-nucleophiles may occur within a ternary complex of enzyme, nitrite, and nucleophile. Catalysis of nitrosyl transfer by nitrite reductase represents a new class of enzymatic reactions and may present another example of electrophilic catalysis by a metal center. The nitrosyl donor trapped by these reactions is believed to represent an intermediate in the reduction of nitrite by cytochrome c,d1."
https://openalex.org/W1511952959,"We previously reported that 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor is processed intracellularly to acidic macromolecules in Rat-1 fibroblasts. The present study defines the precursor-product relationship and localization of the processing steps to subcellular organelles by the use of a single isoelectric species of 125I-epidermal growth factor and Percoll gradient fractionation. The native pI 4.55 125I-epidermal growth factor was rapidly processed to a pI 4.2 species on or near the cell surface and in organelles corresponding to clathrin-coated vesicles, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum. This species was then processed to a pI 4.35 species in similar organelles. The pI 4.2 and 4.35 species were converted to a pI 4.0 species in dense, lysosome-like organelles. This species was ultimately degraded and exocytosed from the cell as low molecular weight products."
https://openalex.org/W1537611567,"Purified rabbit liver glycogen synthase was found to be a substrate for six different protein kinases: (i) cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, (ii) two Ca2+-stimulated protein kinases, phosphorylase kinase (from muscle) and a calmodulin-dependent glycogen synthase kinase, and (iii) three members of a Ca2+ and cyclic nucleotide independent class, PC0.7, FA/GSK-3, and casein kinase-1. Greatest inactivation accompanied phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (to 0.5-0.7 phosphate/subunit, +/- glucose-6-P activity ratio reduced from approximately 1 to 0.6) or FA/GSK-3 (to approximately 1 phosphate/subunit, activity ratio, 0.46). Phosphorylation by the combination FA/GSK-3 plus PC0.7 was synergistic, and more extensive inactivation was achieved. The phosphorylation reactions just described caused significant reductions in the Vmax of the glycogen synthase with little effect on the S0.5 (substrate concentration corresponding to Vmax/2). Phosphorylase kinase achieved a lesser inactivation, to an activity ratio of 0.75 at 0.6 phosphate/subunit. PC0.7 acting alone, casein kinase-1, and the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase did not cause inactivation of liver glycogen synthase with the conditions used. Analysis of CNBr fragments of phosphorylated glycogen synthase indicated that the phosphate was distributed primarily between two polypeptides, with apparent Mr = 12,300 (CB-I) and 16,000-17,000 (CB-II). PC0.7 and casein kinase-1 displayed a decided specificity for CB-II, and the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase was specific for CB-I. The other protein kinases were able, to some extent, to introduce phosphate into both CB-I and CB-II. Studies using limited proteolysis indicated that CB-II was located at a terminal region of the subunit. CB-I contains a minimum of one phosphorylation site and CB-II at least three sites. Liver glycogen synthase is therefore potentially subject to the same type of multisite regulation as skeletal muscle glycogen synthase although the muscle and liver enzymes display significant differences in both structural and kinetic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1592159850,"A consequence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) action in kidney is the enhanced production of 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25-(OH)2D3). We have studied this apparent induction phenomenon in two established mammalian cell lines of renal origin. A porcine kidney cell line, LLC-PK1, was found to possess typical receptors for 1,25-(OH)2D3 which sediment at 3.3 S and bind to immobilized DNA. Saturation analysis of LLC-PK1 cell cytosol revealed an equilibrium binding constant (Kd) for 1,25-(OH)2D3 of 7.8 X 10(-11) M and a concentration of 5400 binding sites/cell. In the presence of serum, intact LLC-PK1 cells also internalize and bind 1,25-(OH)2D3. In contrast, a monkey kidney cell line, LLC-MK2, was found to contain a negligible concentration of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor by all criteria examined. However, both renal cell lines respond to 1,25-(OH)2D3 with a 2- to 20-fold increase in basal levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase (24-hydroxylase) activity. Incubation of viable cell suspensions with 25-hydroxy[26,27-3H]vitamin D3 (0.5 microM) at 37 degrees C for 30 min followed by subsequent analysis of lipid extracts via high performance liquid chromatography was carried out to assess 24,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 formation. Enzyme induction was found to be specific for 1,25-(OH)2D3 in both cell lines with half-maximal stimulation of 24-hydroxylase activity observed at 0.2 and greater than or equal to 1.0 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 in LLC-PK1 and LLC-MK2, respectively. The response in LLC-PK1 was more rapid (1-4 h) than in LLC-MK2 (4-8 h) following 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of cultures in situ. In both cell lines, actinomycin D abolished the 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent increase in 24-hydroxylase activity. Our results suggest that the high affinity 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor may not be required for 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent induction of renal 24-hydroxylase activity. Alternatively, LLC-MK2 cells could contain an atypical form of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor protein which retains functionality but escapes detection by standard binding techniques."
https://openalex.org/W1486315165,"The interaction between P-450C21 and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, both purified from bovine adrenocortical microsomes, has been investigated in a reconstituted system with a nonionic detergent, Emulgen 913, by kinetic analysis and gel filtrations. Steady state kinetic data in progesterone 21-hydroxylation showed formation of an equimolar complex between the two enzyme proteins at low Emulgen concentration. Steady state kinetic studies on the electron transfer from NADPH to P-450C21 via the reductase showed that a stable complex formation between the two enzyme proteins was not involved in the steady state electron transfer at high Emulgen concentration. In stopped flow experiments, a time course of the P-450C21 reduction showed biphasic kinetics composed of fast and slow phases. The dependence of kinetic parameters on Emulgen concentration indicates that the fast phase corresponds to the electron transfer within the complex and the slow phase to the electron transfer through a random collision between P-450C21 and the reductase. The stable complex formation between P-450C21 and the reductase has been clearly demonstrated by gel filtration. The stable complex was composed of several molecules of the two enzyme proteins at an equimolar ratio, which was active for progesterone 21-hydroxylation and had a tendency to dissociate at high Emulgen concentration."

The first free radical to form is identified as the 4-methoxy-1,2-benzosemiquinone radical anion. The peak concentration of this radical increases with tyrosinase concentration; a minimum concentration of 50 micrograms/ml of tyrosinase was needed to observe this radical. The peak concentration of this radical is independent of 4-hydroxyanisole concentration. This radical is produced by reverse dismutation of the primary product, 4-methoxy-1,2-benzoquinone and 4-methoxycatechol produced indirectly."

The 420 nm form shows the enhancement of catalytic activity associated with the pulsed enzyme. Addition of hydrogen peroxide to the 420 nm form gives rise to the 428 nm band of the oxygenated enzyme, thereby clearly establishing that the 428 nm form is a peroxide derivative of the fully oxidized enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W1486295972,"We have studied steady state kinetics of phosphorylation of [Val5]angiotensin II by pp60src, the transforming gene product of Rous sarcoma virus. Results of initial rate studies at varying substrate concentrations indicated that the mechanism was sequential; Michaelis constants for ATP and peptide were 7 microM and 0.24 mM, respectively, and Vmax was 1.0 nmol/min/mg. The end product ADP and the ATP analog AMP-PNP were competitive inhibitors at varying ATP concentrations and noncompetitive inhibitors at varying peptide concentrations. A dead-end analog of angiotensin II, [delta Phe4]angiotensin II, was a noncompetitive inhibitor at varying ATP concentrations, but induced substrate inhibition at varying peptide concentrations. The kinetic data allowed us to conclude that the reaction proceeded via an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism with ATP as the first binding substrate. We also presented evidence that, while pp60src contained essential histidine and/or lysine residues in its active site, the mechanism does not involve a phosphoryl enzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1510056139,"Distribution of specific binding sites for [3H]nitrendipine was studied in subcellular fractions isolated from rat gastric fundus smooth muscle and from rat myometrium. There was an excellent correlation between the distribution of [3H]nitrendipine binding determined at the nitrendipine concentrations of 0.138 and 1.38 nM, and the distribution of the plasma membrane markers K+-activated ouabain-sensitive p-nitrophenylphosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, phosphodiesterase I, and Mg-ATPase, but not between the mitochondrial markers cytochrome c, oxidase, succinate-dependent cytochrome c reductase, or rotenone-insensitive NADH-dependent cytochrome c reductase or the putative endoplasmic reticulum marker NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductase. The binding occurred with high affinity and with a similar (0.097-0.146 nM) equilibrium dissociation constant to all the fractions, even though the density of binding sites varied and was highest in the plasma membrane marker-enriched fractions. The maximal binding in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction from the rat gastric fundus smooth muscle was 0.43 +/- 0.04 pmol/mg, and in that from rat myometrium was 0.72 +/- 0.09 pmol/mg. Thus in the two smooth muscles studied the plasma membrane is the locus of the high affinity nitrendipine binding."
https://openalex.org/W1488653123,"Soluble and membrane associated proline dehydrogenase differ in catalytic properties. The soluble enzyme transfers electrons from L-proline to exogenous electron acceptors. It has a high Km for L-proline (105 mM) and is insensitive to the respiratory chain inhibitors 5-ethyl-5-isopentyl-barbituric acid and cyanide. The membrane-associated enzyme transfers electrons from L-proline to O2 via the respiratory chain, with coupled transmembrane proton translocation. It has a low Km for L-proline (3 mM) and is inhibited by 5-ethyl-5-isopentyl-barbituric acid and cyanide. Proline:O2 oxidoreductase activity identical to that of native membranes can be reconstituted using enzyme purified in the absence of detergent and enzyme deficient membranes from a putA mutant strain. Reassociation of the enzyme with the membrane is an autocatalytic process that requires the simultaneous presence of L-proline, MgCl2, enzyme, and membranes. It can be monitored by observing the chromogenic reaction of delta 1-pyrroline carboxylic acid with o-aminobenzaldehyde. Reduction of membrane components or generation of a protonmotive force is apparently required to promote enzyme-membrane association or to activate electron transfer. The reconstituted activity is a saturable function of enzyme concentration at constant membrane concentration and the activity approached is 20-fold higher than that of native membranes isolated from bacteria that have been induced for proline utilization. It is therefore unlikely that saturation of the available membrane binding sites is achieved during induction of the put genes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1515068315,The 319 nucleotide long intergenic region between the rplL (L12) and the rpoB (beta) genes of the L10 operon contains a transcription attenuation sequence and a RNase III mRNA processing sequence. Four site specific deletions located within this intergenic space which remove either the transcription attenuation sequence or the RNase III mRNA processing sequence or both sequences have been isolated on recombinant DNA plasmids carrying this operon. Deletions of sequences surrounding the RNase III processing site result in a uniform 80-90% reduction in the translational efficiency of beta subunit mRNA. This reduction in translation efficiency appears not to be related to processing per se; transcription of the rpoB and rpoC genes and the translation efficiency of the respective mRNA sequences were indistinguishable in an RNase III processing defective mutant (rnc) and its isogenic parent (rnc+). Deletions of the attenuator sequence result in a substantial increase in the downstream transcription of the beta subunit gene. The translational efficiency of RNase III processed beta subunit mRNA was found to be related in an inverse manner to the level of beta subunit synthesis. These result suggest that sequences on the mRNA in the vicinity of the RNase III processing site (i) are essential for efficient translation of beta subunit mRNA and (ii) are utilized for reducing the translational efficiency of the beta subunit mRNA when the beta subunit protein is produced in excess of that required for RNA polymerase assembly.

https://openalex.org/W1599390884,"The receptors and actions of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) were analyzed in cultured testicular cells from 20.5-day fetal rats, in which treatment with luteinizing hormone (LH) maintained Leydig cell steroidogenesis and gonadotropic responses for up to 2 weeks. Testicular GnRH receptors were present on the 5th postnatal day, but were not demonstrable in fetal testes or 2-day cultures thereof. However, GnRH receptors were readily detectable in 4-day cultured fetal testes and were increased by exposure to GnRH agonists. In LH-treated cultures, GnRH sites were reduced by about 50% and did not increase during incubation with GnRH agonists. In such cultures, GnRH agonists inhibited LH-dependent steroid production and abolished the acute testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of [D-Ala6]des-Gly10-GnRH-N-ethylamide (3 X 10(-10)M) was commensurate with its binding affinity for testis receptors (Kd = 1.4 X 10(-10)M). In contrast, GnRH agonists had no inhibitory effects in 2-day cultures prior to the detection of GnRH receptors. The expression of functional GnRH receptors during culture in the absence of gonadotropin and their suppression in LH-treated cultures suggest that pituitary gonadotropins exert a tonic inhibitory effect upon testicular GnRH receptors. The demonstrated inhibitory actions of GnRH on steroidogenesis, with the expression of GnRH receptors in cultured fetal testes and 5-day postnatal testes, indicate that GnRH agonists could influence the actions of gonadotropins upon Leydig cell function in the neonatal testis."

With the two different macromolecular spin probes, it was possible to determine the relative apparent affinity constants, Kapp, over a large affinity domain. In 20 mM Tris X HCl (pH 8.1), 1 mM sodium EDTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% Triton, and 125 mM NaCl, the following affinity relationship was observed: K(dT)napp = 10(3) KfdDNAapp = 2 X 10(4) K(A)napp = 6.6 X 10(4) KrRNAapp = 1.5 X 10(5) KR17RNAapp. Increasing the [NaCl] from 125 to 200 mM caused considerably less tight binding of gene 5 protein to (lA,A)n, and a typical cooperative binding isotherm was observed, whereas at the lower [NaCl] used for the competition experiments, the binding was essentially stoichiometric. A computer fit of the experimental titration data at 200 mM NaCl gave an intrinsic binding constant, Kint, of 1300 M-1 and a cooperativity factor, omega, of 60 (Kint omega = Kapp) for (lA,A)n."
https://openalex.org/W1542298559,"Glycerol oxidase purified from Aspergillus japonicus AT 008 had Mr = 400,000 and contained 1 mol of protoheme IX and 2 g atoms of copper/mol of enzyme protein. The absorption maxima of the oxidized form were found at 557, 530, 420, 280, and 238 nm, and those of the reduced form at 557 and 430 nm. Anaerobic addition of glycerol to the enzyme produced both a shift of the Soret band from 420 to 410 nm and bleaching of the alpha and beta bands at 557 and 530 nm. The ESR spectrum of glycerol oxidase showed three major signals at g = 1.99, g = 2.00, and g = 2.02. The signals at g = 1.99 and g = 2.02 were diminished by the anaerobic addition of glycerol, and the three signals completely disappeared after the addition of either dithionite or diethyldithiocarbamate. Exposure of glycerol oxidase to a borate buffer of pH 10.0 resulted in activation of the enzyme with concomitant enhancement of the ESR signals at g = 1.99 and g = 2.02. Since glycerol oxidase acts predominantly on glycerol, the enzyme can be employed in a specific colorimetric assay for serum triglycerides in combination with lipoprotein lipase."
https://openalex.org/W1559554438,"H1 histone of rat liver consists of four molecular species designated as H1-1, -2, -3, -4. After partial hepatectomy, phosphorylation of H1-3 was induced first, occurring even within 15 h after the operation. By partial hepatectomy, the rate of incorporation of [3H]lysine into H1 histone increased an average of 4-5 times, but that into H1-4 increased 16-20 times. This actively synthesized H1-4 was subsequently degraded rapidly. Thus induction of this active turnover of H1-4 seems to be correlated with liver regeneration. The maximum activity for phosphorylation of H1-3 attained in regenerating liver was five times that in normal liver. By 36 h after the operation, the phosphorylated peak in the chromatographic pattern had moved forward to a position between the peaks of H1-2 and H1-3, named H1-3'. The newly synthesized H1-3 was not transferred appreciably to H1-3' within 30 h after the operation. At 48 h after the operation, H1-3' amounted to 40% of the total H1-3 subtype. The specificity of the phosphorylation reaction was examined in a reaction system consisting of isolated H1 histone and cAMP-dependent kinase. It was concluded that the specificity of the phosphorylation reaction in vivo was due mainly to the difference in structures of different H1 subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W1573115399,"Abstract Monoclonal antibodies were raised that recognize a series of highly antigenic, protease-sensitive peptides that modulate protein phosphatase activity in reticulocyte extracts. Purified antigen peptides cause a 3-fold increase in the enzymatic activity of a homogeneous Mr congruent to 56,000 protein phosphatase. The monoclonal antibodies inhibit protein phosphatase activity in crude extracts but do not recognize the protein phosphatase itself. The antigen peptides are associated with the phosphatase throughout its purification from the postribosomal supernatant of rabbit reticulocytes but are separated from it during size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (see accompanying article: Wollny, E., Watkins, K., Kramer, G., and Hardesty, B. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2484-2492). The series of antigenic peptides appears to be derived by proteolysis from a 230,000-Da precursor, which is relatively abundant in undegraded form in the membrane fraction of rabbit reticulocytes and is present in erythrocyte ghosts. Antigen peptides are extracted with spectrin from both sources. The Mr congruent to 230,000 peptide is not the alpha or beta subunit of spectrin or ankyrin and appears not to have been recognized previously. The name regulin is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2000103017,"Coxsackie A viruses can infect denervated but not innervated mature skeletal muscles. The role of synaptic transmission in preventing susceptibility to Coxsackievirus infection was studied by surgically denervating leg muscles of mice or injecting the muscles with botulinum toxin to block quantal release of acetylcholine. Control muscles were injected with heat-inactivated toxin. Subsequent injection of Coxsackie A2 virus resulted in extensive virus replication and tissue destruction in the denervated and botulinum toxin-treated muscles, while the control muscles showed only minimal changes. This suggests that the susceptibility of skeletal muscle to Coxsackievirus infection is regulated by synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1505520086,"Abstract We have mapped a major initiation site of purified calf thymus RNA polymerase II in the cloned adenovirus 2 major late promoter. The specificity of this initiation site has been determined by run-off transcriptional analysis and by RNase T1 analysis which employs single-stranded M13 phage DNA containing the Adenovirus 2 major late promoter as probe. The TATAAA region which is used as the start site by the purified RNA polymerase II for in vitro transcription is 30 base pairs upstream from the adenovirus major late in vivo start site. The exact sequence also exists at two sites within the pBR322 plasmid but initiation does not occur at either of these sites. This indicates that the purified enzyme is not just recognizing AT-rich regions but that it is recognizing both the TATA box and its surrounding sequences. The purified RNA polymerase II transcriptional initiation site is used when transcription was carried out on either a superhelical (FI) or linear (FIII) DNA template. Selective initiation of transcription on FI DNA required (NH4)2SO4 concentrations which ranged from 90 to 150 mM. In contrast, selective initiation of transcription on FIII DNA was observed at (NH4)2SO4 concentrations that ranged from 30 to 120 mM."
https://openalex.org/W1589456567,"Sulfide irreversibly inactivates beef plasma amine oxidase in a time-dependent reaction. Mercaptoacetic acid and 2-mercaptoethanol do not inactivate the enzyme. The sulfide complex displayed an intense absorption band at 360 nm (epsilon = 6000 M-1 cm-1, per mol of copper) that is assigned as sigma S leads to Cu(II) ligand to metal charge-transfer transition. However, this band slowly decreased in intensity; the final spectrum resembles the spectrum of the dithionite-reduced enzyme. Bleaching at approximately 450-500 nm specifically indicates that the organic cofactor is reduced. EPR parameters for the sulfide complex differ significantly from those observed for the native amine oxidase. Superhyperfine structure, attributable to coordinated nitrogens, is clearly evident. Time-dependent reduction of Cu(II) that parallels the kinetics and absorbance changes was also observed by EPR. The amine oxidaseazide complex was inactivated by sulfide at a considerably slower rate than the resting enzyme. Since azide is known to coordinate to Cu(II) in beef plasma amine oxidase, the data strongly suggest that enzyme-bound copper is the site of action for inhibition by sulfide."
