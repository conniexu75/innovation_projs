https://openalex.org/W2032579724,"A complementary DNA for the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) produces a fluorescent product when expressed in prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) or eukaryotic (Caenorhabditis elegans) cells. Because exogenous substrates and cofactors are not required for this fluorescence, GFP expression can be used to monitor gene expression and protein localization in living organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1965127482,"Thermodynamic studies have demonstrated the central importance of a large negative heat capacity change (delta C degree assoc) in site-specific protein-DNA recognition. Dissection of the large negative delta C degree assoc and the entropy change of protein-ligand and protein-DNA complexation provide a thermodynamic signature identifying processes in which local folding is coupled to binding. Estimates of the number of residues that fold on binding obtained from this analysis agree with structural data. Structural comparisons indicate that these local folding transitions create key parts of the protein-DNA interface. The energetic implications of this ""induced fit"" model for DNA site recognition are considered."
https://openalex.org/W2147251439,"The success of Mycobacterium species as pathogens depends on their ability to maintain an infection inside the phagocytic vacuole of the macrophage. Although the bacteria are reported to modulate maturation of their intracellular vacuoles, the nature of such modifications is unknown. In this study, vacuoles formed around Mycobacterium avium failed to acidify below pH 6.3 to 6.5. Immunoelectron microscopy of infected macrophages and immunoblotting of isolated phagosomes showed that Mycobacterium vacuoles acquire the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1, but not the vesicular proton-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) responsible for phagosomal acidification. This suggests either a selective inhibition of fusion with proton-ATPase-containing vesicles or a rapid removal of the complex from Mycobacterium phagosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1974223005,"The corpora pedunculata, or mushroom bodies (MBs), in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster adults consist of approximately 2500 parallel Kenyon cell fibers derived from four MB neuroblasts. Hydroxyurea fed to newly hatched larvae selectively deletes these cells, resulting in complete, precise MB albation. Adult flies developing without MBs behave normally in most respects, but are unable to perform in a classical conditioning paradigm that tests associative learning of odor cues and electric shock. This deficit cannot be attributed to reductions in olfactory sensitivity, shock reactivity, or locomotor behavior. The results demonstrate that MBs mediate associative odor learning in flies."
https://openalex.org/W1993336052,"Interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE) is a mammalian homolog of CED-3, a protein required for programmed cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The activity of ICE can be specifically inhibited by the product of crmA, a cytokine response modifier gene encoded by cowpox virus. Microinjection of the crmA gene into chicken dorsal root ganglion neurons was found to prevent cell death induced by deprivation of nerve growth factor. Thus, ICE is likely to participate in neuronal death in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1989429141,"Many transcription factors contain proline- or glutamine-rich activation domains. Here it is shown that simple homopolymeric stretches of these amino acids can activate transcription when fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 factor. In vitro, activity increased with polymer length, whereas in cell transfection assays maximal activity was achieved by 10 to 30 glutamines or about 10 prolines. Similar results were obtained when glutamine stretches were placed within a [GAL4]-VP16 chimeric protein. Because these stretches are encoded by rapidly evolving triplet repeats (microsatellites), they may be the main cause for modulation of transcription factor activity and thus result in subtle or overt genomic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2041659572,"A phage display system was developed and used to select zinc finger proteins with altered DNA-binding specificities. The three zinc fingers of the Zif268 protein were expressed on the surface of filamentous phage, and a library of variants was prepared by randomizing critical amino acids in the first zinc finger. Affinity selections, using DNA sites with base changes in the region recognized by the first finger, yielded Zif268 variants that bound tightly and specifically to the new sites. This phage system provides a tool for the study of protein-DNA interactions and may offer a general method for selecting zinc finger proteins that recognize desired target sites on double-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2032121387,"Increased discharge activity of mesopontine cholinergic neurons participates in the production of electroencephalographic (EEG) arousal; such arousal diminishes as a function of the duration of prior wakefulness or of brain hyperthermia. Whole-cell and extracellular recordings in a brainstem slice show that mesopontine cholinergic neurons are under the tonic inhibitory control of endogenous adenosine, a neuromodulator released during brain metabolism. This inhibitory tone is mediated postsynaptically by an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance and by an inhibition of the hyperpolarization-activated current. These data provide a coupling mechanism linking neuronal control of EEG arousal with the effects of prior wakefulness, brain hyperthermia, and the use of the adenosine receptor blockers caffeine and theophylline."
https://openalex.org/W2001922490,"Human platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) expressed in human Hep G2 cells internalized and concentrated in a juxtanuclear region near the Golgi network within 10 minutes after the cells were treated with PDGF. A PDGFR mutant (F5) that lacks high-affinity binding sites for the Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase), Ras guanosine triphosphatase activating protein, phospholipase C-γ, and a phosphotyrosine phosphatase (Syp) remained at the cell periphery. Restoration of the PI-3 kinase binding sites on F5 completely restored the ability of the receptor to concentrate intracellularly. A PDGFR mutant lacking only PI-3 kinase binding sites failed to concentrate intracellularly. Thus, PI-3 kinase binding sites appear both necessary and sufficient for the normal endocytic trafficking of the activated PDGFR."
https://openalex.org/W1544068656,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-5A (formerly eIF-4D) is thought to function in protein synthesis by promoting synthesis of the first peptide bond because it stimulates methionyl-puromycin formation in vitro. eIF-5A is encoded by two genes (TIF51A and TIF51B) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; the protein and its hypusine modification are essential for cell viability. To analyze the factor's function in vivo, we expressed from the repressible GAL promoter a functional but unstable eIF-5A fusion protein (R-eIF-5A) with an NH2-terminal arginine which is subject to rapid turnover through the NH2-terminal end rule proteolytic pathway. When the conditional mutant strain is shifted from galactose to glucose medium, the rapid disappearance of R-eIF-5A protein occurs within one generation, causing an immediate inhibition of cell growth. However, eIF-5A-depleted cells synthesize protein at about 70% of the wild type rate and exhibit only a slight change in polysome profiles reflecting a subtle defect in a late step of translation initiation. These results suggest that the activity of eIF-5A may not be absolutely essential for general protein synthesis. Rather, eIF-5A may be selectively required for translation of certain mRNAs and/or may be involved in some other aspect of cell metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2038773736,"Antigen-specific immunosuppression requires an understanding of the parameters that control peripheral T cell tolerance. A liver-specific inducible promoter was used to drive the expression of the major histocompatibility complex antigen Kb in transgenic mice. Minute amounts of Kb, expressed exclusively on hepatocytes, induced tolerance by partial down-regulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) on the self-reactive CD8+ cells. Contact of these tolerant T cells with high concentrations of Kb after induction led to complete down-regulation of TCR. Thus, tolerant T cells are susceptible to further tolerogenic signals and reach different levels of tolerance depending on antigen dose."
https://openalex.org/W1562699269,"It has recently been shown that Ras proteins interact directly with Raf serine/threonine kinases in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid system, leading to speculation that Raf proteins function as effectors for Ras. Here it is demonstrated that the endogenous Raf-1 protein co-immunoprecipitates with Ras from mammalian cells when the non-neutralizing anti-Ras monoclonal antibody Y13-238 is used. The formation of a Ras-Raf complex is absolutely dependent on prior treatment of the cells with a stimulus that activates Ras: phorbol ester or anti-T cell receptor antibody in the case of human peripheral blood T lymphoblasts, or epidermal growth factor in the case of Rat-1 fibroblasts. Up to 3% of cellular Raf-1 can be found in association with Ras. The association is not competed by addition of exogenous GST-Raf to the cell lysates and is therefore unlikely to be due to Ras-Raf binding after cell lysis. Specific interaction of Ras and Raf therefore occurs in intact mammalian cells in response to stimuli that cause Ras to become GTP-bound."
https://openalex.org/W1994203972,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), but not lymphotoxin (LT), is directly trypanolytic for salivarian trypanosomes. This activity was not blocked by soluble 55-kilodalton and 75-kilodalton TNF receptors, but was potently inhibited by N,N'-diacetylchitobiose, an oligosaccharide that binds TNF. Comparative sequence analysis of TNF and LT localized the trypanocidal region, and synthetic peptides were trypanolytic. TNF molecules in which the trypanocidal region was mutated or deleted retained tumoricidal activity. Thus, trypanosome-TNF interactions occur via a TNF domain, probably with lectin-like affinity, which is functionally and spatially distinct from the mammalian TNF receptor binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1977941460,"Age-specific mortality rates in isogenic populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans increase exponentially throughout life. In genetically heterogeneous populations, age-specific mortality increases exponentially until about 17 days and then remains constant until the last death occurs at about 60 days. This period of constant age-specific mortality results from genetic heterogeneity. Subpopulations differ in mean life-span, but they all exhibit near exponential, albeit different, rates of increase in age-specific mortality. Thus, much of the observed heterogeneity in mortality rates later in life could result from genetic heterogeneity and not from an inherent effect of aging."
https://openalex.org/W2065920712,"The three-dimensional structure of a catalytic antibody (1F7) with chorismate mutase activity has been determined to 3.0 A resolution as a complex with a transition state analog. The structural data suggest that the antibody stabilizes the same conformationally restricted pericyclic transition state as occurs in the uncatalyzed reaction. Overall shape and charge complementarity between the combining site and the transition state analog dictate preferential binding of the correct substrate enantiomer in a conformation appropriate for reaction. Comparison with the structure of a chorismate mutase enzyme indicates an overall similarity between the catalytic mechanism employed by the two proteins. Differences in the number of specific interactions available for restricting the rotational degrees of freedom in the transition state, and the lack of multiple electrostatic interactions that might stabilize charge separation in this highly polarized metastable species, are likely to account for the observed 10(4) times lower activity of the antibody relative to that of the natural enzymes that catalyze this reaction. The structure of the 1F7 Fab'-hapten complex provides confirmation that the properties of an antibody catalyst faithfully reflect the design of the transition state analog."
https://openalex.org/W1975167911,"The TAFII250 subunit of the human transcription factor IID (TFIID) rescues the temperature-sensitive hamster cell line ts13 and overcomes a G1 arrest. Investigation of the transcriptional properties of ts13 nuclear extracts in vitro showed that activation by the site-specific regulators Sp1 and Gal4VP16 is temperature sensitive in ts13 extracts, whereas basal transcription remains unaffected. This transcriptional defect can be rescued by purified human TFIID or by expression of wild-type TAFII250 in ts13 cells. Expression from the cyclin A but not c-fos promoter is temperature sensitive in these mutant cells. Thus, the mutation in TAFII250 appears to have gene-specific effects that may lead to the ts13 cell cycle phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2017777009,"An RNA polymerase II transcription system was resolved and reconstituted from extracts of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Exchange with components of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae system was undertaken to reveal the factor or factors responsible for the difference in location of the transcription start site, about 30 base pairs and 40 to 120 base pairs downstream of the TATA box in S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, respectively. Two components, counterparts of human transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) and TFIIH, could be exchanged individually between systems without effect on the start site. Three components, counterparts of human TFIIB, TFIIE, and RNA polymerase II, could not be exchanged individually but could be swapped in the pairs TFIIE-TFIIH and TFIIB-RNA polymerase II, which demonstrates that there are functional interactions between these components. Moreover, exchange of the latter pair shifted the starting position, which shows that TFIIB and RNA polymerase II are solely responsible for determining the start site of transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2067947751,"Externally applied electric field gradients gave rise to lateral concentration gradients in monolayers of certain binary lipid mixtures. For binary mixtures of dihydrocholesterol and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, the application of an electric field gradient at pressures below the critical pressure produced a liquid-liquid phase separation in a monolayer that is otherwise homogenous. At pressures slightly above the critical pressure, a field gradient produced a large concentration gradient without phase separation. The lipid concentration gradients can be described by equilibrium thermodynamic chemical potentials. The observed effects appear to be relevant to the structure and composition of biological membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1549463507,"Interactions between fibronectin (FN) and glycosaminoglycans are essential for extracellular matrix morphology and cell adhesion. One of the most abundant glycosaminoglycans is chondroitin sulfate, and here we show that recombinant FNs (deminectins (DN)) containing the carboxyl-terminal cell, heparin, and fibrin domains bind specifically to chondroitin sulfate in affinity chromatography assays. Using a panel of mutant DNs, important determinants for chondroitin sulfate binding have been localized to repeats III13 and III14 within the heparin domain. In particular, mutation of an arginine pair in repeat III13 to neutral residues ablated binding to chondroitin sulfate as we previously reported for heparin (Barkalow, F.J.B., and Schwarzbauer, J.E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7812-7818). These results, in combination with the ability of heparin and chondroitin sulfate to compete for binding to DNs, demonstrate that these two glycosaminoglycans interact with similar or overlapping sites in FN. One important difference between FN interactions with heparin and chondroitin sulfate is that, while FN and DNs bound equally to heparin, FN bound less efficiently than DNs to chondroitin sulfate. Reduced binding to chondroitin sulfate was also observed with a larger recombinant FN lacking internal repeats III1-7 indicating that the amino-terminal region acts to limit binding to the carboxyl-terminal domain. Our results demonstrate that interactions between FN and chondroitin sulfate are modulated by molecular context."
https://openalex.org/W1504116566,"We have reported previously that the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) inhibits transiently Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane Ca2+ pathway activated by emptying the intracellular Ca2+ stores (Montero, M., Garcia-Sancho, J., and Alvarez, J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 13055-13061). We show here that calyculin A and okadaic acid, inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, prevent the spontaneous reversion of the fMLP-induced inhibition of the entry of Ca2+ and Mn2+ (used as a Ca2+ surrogate), leading to a permanently inhibited Ca2+ entry pathway. At high concentrations or long incubation times the phosphatase inhibitors were even able to inhibit the store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway (SOCP) in the absence of fMLP. Inhibition of SOCP by phorbol dibutyrate, which is not reversible, was not modified by phosphatase inhibitors. These results provide additional support for the view that fMLP inhibits SOCP through phosphorylation of either the SOCP protein or a regulatory protein and indicate that dephosphorylation mediated by protein phosphatases 1 and/or 2A restores the activity of SOCP after inhibition by fMLP. The time course of the inhibition of SOCP by fMLP was similar to the one reported previously for the transient fMLP-induced phosphorylation of a 47-kDa protein involved in the generation of respiratory burst, which was similarly affected by the phosphatase inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2024953438,"The mechanism by which western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus and other mosquito-borne alphaviruses (Togaviridae) survive during periods of vector inactivity is unknown. Recently, three strains of WEE virus were isolated from adult Aedes dorsalis collected as larvae from a salt marsh in a coastal region of California. This provides evidence of vertical transmission of WEE virus in mosquitoes in nature. Vertical transmission in Ae. dorsalis and closely related mosquito species may be an important mechanism for the maintenance of WEE virus in temperate regions in North America where horizontal transmission of the virus is seasonal."

https://openalex.org/W1541067662,"Chloroplast-encoded large subunits of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39) are insoluble when separated from the holoenzyme or expressed in Escherichia coli, limiting directed mutagenesis to prokaryotic enzymes. In the present study, we performed directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation with the large subunit gene of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Two separate mutations were created that are known to influence the CO2/O2 specificity of prokaryotic enzymes. The asparagine 123 to glycine and serine 379 to alanine substitutions gave rise to photosynthesis-deficient mutants that synthesize normal levels of holoenzyme. The Vmax for carboxylation was reduced more than 95% and the Km(CO2) was increased more than 3-fold for both mutant enzymes. Km (O2) was slightly reduced for the glycine 123 enzyme, but increased more than 5-fold for the alanine 379 enzyme. CO2/O2 specificity factors for both enzymes are decreased by more than 70%. Km values for ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate are not significantly affected, but binding affinities for the transition-state analog 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate are reduced. The changes brought about by these substitutions in the eukaryotic large subunit are different from the changes observed in prokaryotic enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1588631671,"The effect of transfection of the type 2 activin receptor, ACTR2, on binding of 125I-activin-A to the surface of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) was investigated. BAEC transfected either with full-length ACTR2 or with a truncated form of ACTR2 lacking the intracellular kinase domain (ACTR2T) displayed two classes of 125I-activin-A binding sites, one of high affinity (Kd = 250-254 pM) and one of low affinity (Kd = 6.5-16 nM). Affinity labeling of ACTR2-transfected BAEC with 125I-activin-A revealed labeled species of 55, 95, 100, and 160 kDa, all four of which were immunoprecipitated by an anti-ACTR2 monoclonal antibody. Only the 95- and 100-kDa species, however, were immunoprecipitated following denaturation of the affinity-labeled cell lysate with SDS. BAEC transfected with an epitope-tagged form of ACTR2T (ACTR2TMyc) displayed intense 55- and 70-kDa affinity-labeled forms of the truncated receptor, together with a 160-kDa species. As with the full-length receptor, the 160-kDa species associated non-covalently with ACTR2TMyc. These data indicate that, in vascular endothelial cells, ACTR2 forms a high affinity heterotrimeric receptor complex with activin-binding proteins characteristic of type 1 and type 3 activin receptors, and that formation of the complex does not require the kinase domain of ACTR2."

https://openalex.org/W1566675488,"Constructions were made from genes encoding ribosomal acidic phosphoproteins YP1 beta (L44') and YP2 beta (L45) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which different parts of the 5'-untranslated regions were included. The constructs were inserted into centromeric plasmids under the control of the GAL1 promoter and expressed in yeast strains in which the genes coding for each acidic protein family, P1 and P2, had been disrupted. Deletions in the 5' region of the two genes have been found to oppositely affect their expression. Deletion of most of this region strongly stimulates the expression of YP2 beta (L45), increasing the translation efficiency of the mRNA, and generating a 6-fold excess of protein in the cell. A similar deletion in the rpYP1 beta gene represses the expression of the protein, reducing drastically the amount of the mRNA in the cell. The overexpression of rpYP2 beta affects the cell growth by inhibiting protein synthesis at the level of initiation. Reduction of the YP2 beta(L45) overproduction by growing in controlled concentrations of glucose abolishes the inhibitory effect. The excess protein, probably as a high molecular weight complex, apparently interferes with the joining of the 60 S subunit to the initiation complex generating the accumulation of polysome half-mers. In addition, the results indicate the existence of a regulatory mechanism by which each one of the two acidic proteins controls the expression of the other polypeptide. YP1 beta(L44') represses the expression of YP2 beta(L45), while this protein stimulates the expression of YP1 beta(L44')."

https://openalex.org/W2410374499,"In this study, rat embryo lung organ cultures were exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). After carcinogen-treatment the cells were dissociated and an epithelial cell line (BP) was developed from the primary cell culture derived from the carcinogen-treated explants. Investigations were performed on the sequential changes occurring in the course of neoplastic progression of BP cells and in the tumor cells that arose in vivo from implanted BP cells. During the neoplastic progression a mutation was shown to occur in p53 gene at codon 130 (AAG > AGG; Lys > Arg) in a single cell which expanded and gave rise to a predominant subpopulation. This mutational event was already detected at passage 14 but was probably not a direct consequence of a specific alteration caused by the carcinogen in the target cell. This mutation was retained through the subsequent progressional steps first as a heterozygous mutation, then converted to a homozygous state. From passage 18 on, it was possible in BP cell cultures to detect foci of larger morphologically distinct cells emerging on a background of cells maintaining the original morphology. These foci were shown to derive from a single cell carrying the p53 mutation in a homozygous state. During the neoplastic progression the mutant p53 allele frequency steadily increased and this mutant allele eventually came to predominate completely in the late stages of the neoplastic progression, including in the transplantation-induced tumors. The pattern of a directional selection for mutant p53 gene towards fixation is probably applicable to a wide range of human malignancies and may reflect the particular importance of this gene for tumorigenesis."
