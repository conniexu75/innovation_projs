https://openalex.org/W2982003255,"Abstract Bacterial blight of rice is an important disease in Asia and Africa. The pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( Xoo ), secretes one or more of six known transcription-activator-like effectors (TALes) that bind specific promoter sequences and induce, at minimum, one of the three host sucrose transporter genes SWEET11 , SWEET13 and SWEET14 , the expression of which is required for disease susceptibility. We used CRISPR–Cas9-mediated genome editing to introduce mutations in all three SWEET gene promoters. Editing was further informed by sequence analyses of TALe genes in 63 Xoo strains, which revealed multiple TALe variants for SWEET13 alleles. Mutations were also created in SWEET14 , which is also targeted by two TALes from an African Xoo lineage. A total of five promoter mutations were simultaneously introduced into the rice line Kitaake and the elite mega varieties IR64 and Ciherang-Sub1. Paddy trials showed that genome-edited SWEET promoters endow rice lines with robust, broad-spectrum resistance."

Here we successfully engraft human microglia derived from embryonic stem cells in the mouse brain. The cells recapitulate transcriptionally human primary microglia ex vivo and show expression of human-specific Alzheimer’s disease risk genes. Oligomeric amyloid-β induces a divergent response in human versus mouse microglia. This model can be used to study the role of microglia in neurological diseases. Human stem cell-derived microglia integrate into mouse brain, displaying transcriptome signatures of microglia directly isolated from human brain and providing a chimeric model to study human-specific aspects of Alzheimer’s disease and other brain diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2981514644,"Premature termination codons (PTCs) can result in the production of truncated proteins or the degradation of messenger RNAs by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Which of these outcomes occurs can alter the effect of a mutation, with the engagement of NMD being dependent on a series of rules. Here, by applying these rules genome-wide to obtain a resource called NMDetective, we explore the impact of NMD on genetic disease and approaches to therapy. First, human genetic diseases differ in whether NMD typically aggravates or alleviates the effects of PTCs. Second, failure to trigger NMD is a cause of ineffective gene inactivation by CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing. Finally, NMD is a determinant of the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, with only frameshifted transcripts that escape NMD predicting a response. These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating the rules of NMD into clinical decision-making. Moreover, they suggest that inhibiting NMD may be effective in enhancing cancer immunotherapy. The authors explore the impact of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) on human genetic disease and cancer immunotherapy by applying the rules of NMD across the genome as a resource called NMDetective."

https://openalex.org/W2981462453,"αMβ2 integrin (complement receptor 3) is a major receptor for phagocytosis in macrophages. In other contexts, integrins' activities and functions are mechanically linked to actin dynamics through focal adhesions. We asked whether mechanical coupling of αMβ2 integrin to the actin cytoskeleton mediates phagocytosis. We found that particle internalization was driven by formation of Arp2/3 and formin-dependent actin protrusions that wrapped around the particle. Focal complex-like adhesions formed in the phagocytic cup that contained β2 integrins, focal adhesion proteins and tyrosine kinases. Perturbation of talin and Syk demonstrated that a talin-dependent link between integrin and actin and Syk-mediated recruitment of vinculin enable force transmission to target particles and promote phagocytosis. Altering target mechanical properties demonstrated more efficient phagocytosis of stiffer targets. Thus, macrophages use tyrosine kinase signalling to build a mechanosensitive, talin- and vinculin-mediated, focal adhesion-like molecular clutch, which couples integrins to cytoskeletal forces to drive particle engulfment."
https://openalex.org/W2981588505,"When learning the value of actions in volatile environments, humans often make seemingly irrational decisions that fail to maximize expected value. We reasoned that these ‘non-greedy’ decisions, instead of reflecting information seeking during choice, may be caused by computational noise in the learning of action values. Here using reinforcement learning models of behavior and multimodal neurophysiological data, we show that the majority of non-greedy decisions stem from this learning noise. The trial-to-trial variability of sequential learning steps and their impact on behavior could be predicted both by blood oxygen level-dependent responses to obtained rewards in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and by phasic pupillary dilation, suggestive of neuromodulatory fluctuations driven by the locus coeruleus–norepinephrine system. Together, these findings indicate that most behavioral variability, rather than reflecting human exploration, is due to the limited computational precision of reward-guided learning. Findling, Skvortsova et al. find that a large fraction of non-greedy decisions that humans make in volatile environments do not stem from exploration but from the limited precision of learning, and further identify its neurophysiological correlates."
https://openalex.org/W2981518956,"Blight-resistant rice lines are the most effective solution for bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Key resistance mechanisms involve SWEET genes as susceptibility factors. Bacterial transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors bind to effector-binding elements (EBEs) in SWEET gene promoters and induce SWEET genes. EBE variants that cannot be recognized by TAL effectors abrogate induction, causing resistance. Here we describe a diagnostic kit to enable analysis of bacterial blight in the field and identification of suitable resistant lines. Specifically, we include a SWEET promoter database, RT-PCR primers for detecting SWEET induction, engineered reporter rice lines to visualize SWEET protein accumulation and knock-out rice lines to identify virulence mechanisms in bacterial isolates. We also developed CRISPR-Cas9 genome-edited Kitaake rice to evaluate the efficacy of EBE mutations in resistance, software to predict the optimal resistance gene set for a specific geographic region, and two resistant 'mega' rice lines that will empower farmers to plant lines that are most likely to resist rice blight."
https://openalex.org/W2981875186,"Aortic calcification is an important independent predictor of future cardiovascular events. We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis to determine SNPs associated with the extent of abdominal aortic calcification (n = 9,417) or descending thoracic aortic calcification (n = 8,422). Two genetic loci, HDAC9 and RAP1GAP, were associated with abdominal aortic calcification at a genome-wide level (P < 5.0 × 10-8). No SNPs were associated with thoracic aortic calcification at the genome-wide threshold. Increased expression of HDAC9 in human aortic smooth muscle cells promoted calcification and reduced contractility, while inhibition of HDAC9 in human aortic smooth muscle cells inhibited calcification and enhanced cell contractility. In matrix Gla protein-deficient mice, a model of human vascular calcification, mice lacking HDAC9 had a 40% reduction in aortic calcification and improved survival. This translational genomic study identifies the first genetic risk locus associated with calcification of the abdominal aorta and describes a previously unknown role for HDAC9 in the development of vascular calcification."
https://openalex.org/W2981761492,"Abstract Gastric cancer (GC) is characterized by extensive local invasion, distant metastasis and poor prognosis. In most cases, GC progression is associated with aberrant expression of cytokines or activation of signaling cascades mediated by tumor–stroma interactions. However, the mechanisms by which these interactions contribute to GC progression are poorly understood. In this study, we find that IL-33 and its receptor ST2L are upregulated in the human GC and served as prognostic markers for poor survival of GC patients. In a co-culture model with GC cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), we further demonstrate that CAFs-derived IL-33 enhances the migration and invasion of GC cells by inducing the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) through activation of the ERK1/2-SP1-ZEB2 pathway in a ST2L-dependent manner. Furthermore, the secretion of IL-33 by CAFs can be induced by the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α that is released by GC cells via TNFR2-NF-κB-IRF-1 pathway. Additionally, silencing of IL-33 expression in CAFs or ST2L expression in GC cells inhibits the peritoneal dissemination and metastatic potential of GC cells in nude mice. Taken together, these results characterize a critical role of the interaction between epithelial-stroma mediated by the TNF-α/IL-33/ST2L signaling in GC progression, and provide a rationale for targeting this pathway to treat GC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2982535577,"The paravertebral spread that occurs after erector spinae plane block may be volume-dependent. This cadaveric study was undertaken to compare the extent of paravertebral spread with erector spinae plane block using different dye volumes. After randomization, twelve erector spinae plane blocks were performed bilaterally with either 10 ml or 30 ml of dye at the level of T5 in seven unembalmed cadavers except for two cases of unexpected pleural puncture using the 10 ml injection. Direct visualization of the paravertebral space by endoscopy was performed immediately after the injections. The back regions were also dissected, and dye spread and nerve involvement were investigated. A total of five 10 ml injections and seven 30 ml injections were completed for both endoscopic and anatomical evaluations. No paravertebral spread was observed by endoscopy after any of the 10-ml injections. Dye spread to spinal nerves at the intervertebral foramen was identified by endoscopy at adjacent levels of T5 (median: three levels) in all 30 ml injections. In contrast, the cases with two, four, and three out of five were stained at only the T4, T5, and T6 levels, respectively, with the 10 ml injection. Upon anatomical dissection, all blocks were consistently associated with posterior and lateral spread to back muscles and fascial layers, especially with the 30 ml injections, which showed greater dye expansion. In one 30 ml injection, sympathetic nerve involvement and epidural spread were observed at the level of the injection site. Although paravertebral spread following erector spinae plane block increased in a volume-dependent manner, this increase was variable and not pronounced. As the injectate volume increased for the erector spinae blocks, the injectate spread to the back muscles and fascial layers seemed to be predominantly increased compared with, the extent of paravertebral spread."
https://openalex.org/W2981721243,"Supramolecular soft crystals are periodic structures that are formed by the hierarchical assembly of complex constituents, and occur in a broad variety of ‘soft-matter’ systems1. Such soft crystals exhibit many of the basic features (such as three-dimensional lattices and space groups) and properties (such as band structure and wave propagation) of their ‘hard-matter’ atomic solid counterparts, owing to the generic symmetry-based principles that underlie both2,3. ‘Mesoatomic’ building blocks of soft-matter crystals consist of groups of molecules, whose sub-unit-cell configurations couple strongly to supra-unit-scale symmetry. As yet, high-fidelity experimental techniques for characterizing the detailed local structure of soft matter and, in particular, for quantifying the effects of multiscale reconfigurability are quite limited. Here, by applying slice-and-view microscopy to reconstruct the micrometre-scale domain morphology of a solution-cast block copolymer double gyroid over large specimen volumes, we unambiguously characterize its supra-unit and sub-unit cell morphology. Our multiscale analysis reveals a qualitative and underappreciated distinction between this double-gyroid soft crystal and hard crystals in terms of their structural relaxations in response to forces—namely a non-affine mode of sub-unit-cell symmetry breaking that is coherently maintained over large multicell dimensions. Subject to inevitable stresses during crystal growth, the relatively soft strut lengths and diameters of the double-gyroid network can easily accommodate deformation, while the angular geometry is stiff, maintaining local correlations even under strong symmetry-breaking distortions. These features contrast sharply with the rigid lengths and bendable angles of hard crystals. Slice-and-view scanning electron microscopy tomography is used to characterize a double-gyroid block copolymer, finding mesoatomic distortions that break the symmetry of these soft-matter crystals across multiple scales."
https://openalex.org/W2981875266,"Motivational states modulate how animals value sensory stimuli and engage in goal-directed behaviors. The motivational states of thirst and hunger are represented in the brain by shared and unique neuromodulatory systems. However, it is unclear how such systems interact to coordinate the expression of appropriate state-specific behavior. We show that the activity of two brain neurons expressing leucokinin neuropeptide is elevated in thirsty and hungry flies, and that leucokinin release is necessary for state-dependent expression of water- and sugar-seeking memories. Leucokinin inhibits two types of mushroom-body-innervating dopaminergic neurons (DANs) to promote thirst-specific water memory expression, whereas it activates other mushroom-body-innervating DANs to facilitate hunger-dependent sugar memory expression. Selection of hunger- or thirst-appropriate memory emerges from competition between leucokinin and other neuromodulatory hunger signals at the level of the DANs. Therefore, coordinated modulation of the dopaminergic system allows flies to prioritize the expression of the relevant state-dependent motivated behavior. The Drosophila neuropeptide leucokinin mediates hunger- and thirst-dependent expression of learned behaviors. State-relevant selection of appropriate memory emerges from competition between leucokinin and other modulators onto dopaminergic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2981857847,"PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi) are known to kill tumor cells via two mechanisms (PARP1 catalytic inhibition and PARP1 trapping). The relative contribution of these two pathways in mediating the cytotoxicity of PARPi, however, is not well understood. Here we designed a series of small molecule PARP degraders. Treatment with one such compound iRucaparib-AP6 results in highly efficient and specific PARP1 degradation. iRucaparib-AP6 blocks the enzymatic activity of PARP1 in vitro, and PARP1-mediated poly-ADP-ribosylation signaling in intact cells. This strategy mimics PARP1 genetic depletion, which enables the pharmacological decoupling of PARP1 inhibition from PARP1 trapping. Finally, by depleting PARP1, iRucaparib-AP6 protects muscle cells and primary cardiomyocytes from DNA-damage-induced energy crisis and cell death. In summary, these compounds represent ‘non-trapping’ PARP1 degraders that block both the catalytic activity and scaffolding effects of PARP1, providing an ideal approach for the amelioration of the various pathological conditions caused by PARP1 hyperactivation. Small molecules that achieve selective PARP1 degradation were developed that block both the catalytic activity and scaffolding effects of PARP1, enabling the decoupling of PARP1 inhibition and PARP1 trapping."
https://openalex.org/W2981877923,"Recently, patients with advanced cancers have been benefited greatly from immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. However, immune checkpoint blockade is still suboptimal in HCC treatment and more immune modifications are needed to achieve an efficient therapeutic goal. Here, we investigated the combined administration of a Listeria-based HCC vaccine, Lmdd-MPFG, and the anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade antibody. We found that Lmdd-MPFG promoted the expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells but resensitized the tumor local T cell to respond to the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine activates the NF-κB pathway in the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through the TLR2 and MyD88 pathway, and recruits p62 to activate the autophagy pathway. The overall effect is skewing the TAMs from M2-polarized TAMs into the M1-polarized TAMs. Most importantly, it skewed the cytokine profiles into antitumor one in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This change restores the T-cell reactivity to the anti-PD-1 blockade. Our results suggested that Lmdd-MPFG combined with PD-1 blockade exerted synergistic antitumor effects through modifying TAMs in the TME and removing T-cell inhibitory signals, thereby providing a new potential strategy for HCC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2982355895,"Sexual activity during youth is common in Lao PDR. However, young people seldom utilize sexual and reproductive health services and subsequently suffer from poor sexual and reproductive health. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the barriers perceived by youth that prevent their access to sexual and reproductive health services.Twenty-nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 participants aged 15-25 years, from urban and rural areas. A vignette was used during interviews with those who had no experience with sexual and reproductive health services. Additionally, seven semi-structured interviews were conducted with health providers from youth-friendly health clinics and from public sexual and reproductive health services. Data were analyzed using a thematic approach.The main barriers preventing young people from accessing sexual and reproductive health services were related to cognitive accessibility and psychosocial accessibility. The cognitive accessibility barriers were a lack of sexual knowledge and a lack of awareness of services. Perceived barriers in psychosocial accessibility were the feelings of shyness and shame caused by negative cultural attitudes to premarital sex, and the fear of parents finding out about visits to public sexual and reproductive health services, due to lack of confidentiality in the services and among health providers. In addition, the barriers of geographical accessibility, mainly insufficient availability of youth-friendly health clinics.To improve access to services, a multi-component strategy is needed: promotion of youth-friendly health clinics; sexual education in schools; a formal referral system between schools and youth-friendly health clinics; and community support interventions. Prior to implementation, more research should be done on the applicability of these methods in the Laos context. Future research should try to determine the cost-effectiveness of youth-friendly health clinics integrated in a district hospital and stand-alone clinics, to provide insight into which form should be further developed."
https://openalex.org/W2981395586,"Over half of cutaneous melanoma tumors have BRAFV600E/K mutations. Acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) remains a major hurdle in attaining durable therapeutic responses. In this study we demonstrate that ~50-60% of melanoma cell lines with vemurafenib resistance acquired in vitro show activation of RhoA family GTPases. In BRAFi-resistant melanoma cell lines and tumors, activation of RhoA is correlated with decreased expression of melanocyte lineage genes. Using a machine learning approach, we built gene expression-based models to predict drug sensitivity for 265 common anticancer compounds. We then projected these signatures onto the collection of TCGA cutaneous melanoma and found that poorly differentiated tumors were predicted to have increased sensitivity to multiple Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitors. Two transcriptional effectors downstream of Rho, MRTF and YAP1, are activated in the RhoHigh BRAFi-resistant cell lines, and resistant cells are more sensitive to inhibition of these transcriptional mechanisms. Taken together, these results support the concept of targeting Rho-regulated gene transcription pathways as a promising therapeutic approach to restore sensitivity to BRAFi-resistant tumors or as a combination therapy to prevent the onset of drug resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2982285093,"Colorectal cancer represents a leading cause of cancer death. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that have been extensively studied in tumours, since changes in their levels can reveal patient prognosis. Cancer progression is also influenced by the circadian system whose functioning is based on the rhythmic expression of clock genes. Therefore, we performed macroarray screening of tumour and adjacent tissues in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal carcinoma. We identified 17 miRNAs showing expression that was more than 100 times higher in tumour tissue compared to adjacent tissue. From in silico analysis, miR-34a-5p was selected as showing a computer-predicted interaction with PER2. Real-time PCR revealed a negative correlation between expression of PER2 mRNA and miR-34a in patients with more advanced cancer stage. Expression of miR-34a was up-regulated in cancer tissue compared to adjacent tissue. High miR-34a expression was associated with better survival of patients. miR-34a showed lower expression levels in male patients with lymph node involvement, and a trend towards decreased expression in male patients with distant metastases. Male patients, but not female patients, with high expression of miR-34a and who were free of distant metastases and/or lymph node involvement showed better survival. Therefore, we proposed that expression of miR-34a was regulated in a sex-dependent manner and could be considered a marker of prognosis in earlier cancer stages in male patients."
https://openalex.org/W2982225991,"Development and differentiation are associated with profound changes to histone modifications, yet their in vivo function remains incompletely understood. Here, we generated mouse models expressing inducible histone H3 lysine-to-methionine (K-to-M) mutants, which globally inhibit methylation at specific sites. Mice expressing H3K36M developed severe anaemia with arrested erythropoiesis, a marked haematopoietic stem cell defect, and rapid lethality. By contrast, mice expressing H3K9M survived up to a year and showed expansion of multipotent progenitors, aberrant lymphopoiesis and thrombocytosis. Additionally, some H3K9M mice succumbed to aggressive T cell leukaemia/lymphoma, while H3K36M mice exhibited differentiation defects in testis and intestine. Mechanistically, induction of either mutant reduced corresponding histone trimethylation patterns genome-wide and altered chromatin accessibility as well as gene expression landscapes. Strikingly, discontinuation of transgene expression largely restored differentiation programmes. Our work shows that individual chromatin modifications are required at several specific stages of differentiation and introduces powerful tools to interrogate their roles in vivo."

However, despite high-resolution structures (GIRK2) and a large number of functional studies, we do not have a coherent picture of how Gβγ and Na+ ions control gating of GIRK2 channels. Here, we utilized computational modeling and all-atom microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations to determine which gates are controlled by Na+ and Gβγ and how each regulator uses the channel domain movements to control gate transitions. We found that Na+ ions control the cytosolic gate of the channel through an anti-clockwise rotation, whereas Gβγ stabilizes the transmembrane gate in the open state through a rocking movement of the cytosolic domain. Both effects alter the way in which the channel interacts with phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and thereby stabilizes the open states of the respective gates.

The GIRK2 structures have provided direct evidence for the multiple gate hypothesis of these channels. These structures point to three constrictions along the permeation pathway: the selectivity filter, where K+ ions are selected over other ions; the helix bundle crossing (HBC) gate, also referred in the literature as the inner helix gate, located near the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane bilayer; and a cytosolic gate that is unique to Kir channels, referred to as the G-loop gate (Fig. S1). The HBC gate is comprised by the side chains of Phe-192, whereas the G-loop gate is comprised by two methionine pairs at the top and bottom of the G loop (Fig. S2B). The GIRK2 structures in complex with the various regulators, obtained mainly from the MacKinnon lab, have provided a wealth of structural information. However, no satisfying structural gating model has resulted that is consistent with the physiological regulation of the channel. None of the structures with physiological regulators have captured the channel gates in the open state. Even the channel bound to all its gating molecules, PIP2, Na+, and Gβγ, which in electrophysiological experiments has been found to activate the channel the most (20Petit-Jacques J. Sui J.L. Logothetis D.E. Synergistic activation of G protein–gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels by the βγ subunits of G proteins and Na+ and Mg2+ ions.J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114 (10532964): 673-68410.1085/jgp.114.5.673Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), did not capture the channel gates in the open state. The structure of a low activity point mutant, GIRK2 (R201A), has come the closest to capturing the gates open, where two of the subunits bound to PIP2 depicted open conformations, but the remaining two that were not PIP2 bound had their gates closed (5Whorton M.R. MacKinnon R. X-ray structure of the mammalian GIRK2–βγ G-protein complex.Nature. 2013; 498 (23739333): 190-19710.1038/nature12241Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the crystal packing prevented PIP2 from binding to all four subunits, leaving two of the four gates in the closed state. Based on this structure, models were created in an effort to understand what structural changes could be predicted, if all subunits would reach the open state, as expected. The binding of Gβγ was predicted to cause an anti-clockwise movement of ∼4° of both the cytoplasmic and transmembrane (TM) domains that put the channel in a “pre-open” state. The R201A mutant channel showed an additional ∼4° twisting movement to cause full gate opening (5Whorton M.R. MacKinnon R.

Table S1 and Fig. S3 show all the crystal structures determined under different conditions with both minimal and α-carbon (Cα) distances between the gates of opposite-facing subunits. This heroic work has answered many questions, but at the same time has left many other questions unanswered. It has also generated puzzling conclusions, perhaps the most troubling of which is the question: does the low activity R201A mutant of the GIRK2 channel represent a valid model of a constitutively active channel that mimics the natural open channel state? Critical mechanistic questions remain, such as which gates are controlled by the two different activators (Na+ versus Gβγ or both) and how the movements caused by these regulators tie into the regulation of the gates by PIP2. Given the nature of these dynamic questions, we pursued them using computational modeling and MD simulations based on the pre-open crystal structure of GIRK2. Five modeled systems ranging from 160,000 to 400,000 atoms were simulated in the absence and presence of an electric field (EF) for a total of 1.0–1.5 μs, respectively (Table S2). The largest system with all the components is illustrated in Fig. S2A. K+ ion permeation is taken as the criterion to designate a channel conformational state under specific conditions as “closed” or “open.” In the GIRK2–Apo system, no ion permeation was seen regardless of whether an EF was applied or not. In contrast, in all other systems of the GIRK2 channel, such as with PIP2 (GIRK2–PIP2 or GIRK2), with PIP2 + Na+ (GIRK2–Na+), with PIP2 + Gβγ (GIRK2–Gβγ), and with PIP2 + Gβγ + Na+ (GIRK2–Gβγ–Na+), K+ ions permeated, albeit inefficiently, even in the presence of EF across the membrane (0.06 V/nm or Vm = −200 mV). However, in the GIRK2–Gβγ–Na+ system, an almost 10-fold greater number of ions permeated under the transmembrane EF (Table 1). The relative permeation seen in these simulations agrees with electrophysiological results (20Petit-Jacques J. Sui J.L. Logothetis D.E. Synergistic activation of G protein–gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels by the βγ subunits of G proteins and Na+ and Mg2+ ions.J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114 (10532964): 673-68410.1085/jgp.114.5.673Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the absence of an external electric field, the MD simulations also showed an outwardly directed flow of K+ (intracellular to extracellular) (data not shown).Table 1The number of K+ for each system that got through the GIRK2 channel and the channel state without or with EF in the last snapshot of MD simulationsSystemsEF = 0 V/nmEF = 0.06 V/nmNo.StateNo.StateGIRK2–Apo0Closed0ClosedGIRK2–PIP2 (GIRK2)2PO3POGIRK2–Na+2PO3POGIRK2–Gβγ2PO4POGIRK2–Gβγ–Na+1Open36Open Open table in a new tab To better understand the gating mechanism, we set the production stage in the presence of an EF, because gating proved more efficient under these conditions (Table 1). All systems were equilibrated by 150 ns of simulation as seen in the root-mean-square deviation plots (Fig. S4). The average distance required to occlude permeation was 5.69 Å and was derived from the GIRK2–Na+ system, which has been shown experimentally to be the least conductive (20Petit-Jacques J. Sui J.L. Logothetis D.E. Synergistic activation of G protein–gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels by the βγ subunits of G proteins and Na+ and Mg2+ ions.J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114 (10532964): 673-68410.1085/jgp.114.5.673Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When both the HBC and G-loop gates exceeded the minimal distance of 5.69 Å, the channel was considered to be in the open state. As designated by vertical lines in Fig. 1, this representation of activity would correspond to the open probability (Po) of the channel in the nanosecond time scale, even though not every time the channel was permeable did an ion in fact permeate. From this simplified analysis, it became apparent that Na+ or Gβγ subunits alone could open GIRK2 and could do so in a synergistic manner when applied together (Fig. 1). In fact, the synergism between the Gβγ subunits and Na+ can be seen in records of single channel activity (cell-attached recordings) of the highly related GIRK4 channel. The gating behavior of certain GIRK4 mutants that mimic the Na+ (i.e. I229L), Gβγ (i.e. S176P), or Na+ + Gβγ (i.e. I229L + S176P) conditions (Fig. 2) (12Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T.

These data obtained from mutants representing the endogenous gating molecules (PIP2, Na+, Gβγ, and Na+/Gβγ) are consistent with prior reports (53Jin T. Sui J.L. Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Chan K.W.

The open probability of each of the two gates individually (HBC and G loop) is shown in Fig. 4. Once Na+ was included in the GIRK2–PIP2 system, there was a clear right shift of the G-loop gate minimum distributions to the open state (Fig. 3). This effect on the G-loop gate was in sharp contrast to the HBC gate, whose minimal distance distributions were not affected by Na+, remaining centered around the nonpermissive 5.69 Å distance (Fig. 3). The G-loop gate Po increased by more than 7-fold, whereas the HBC gate Po, if anything, was somewhat decreased (Table 2 and Fig. 4). Overall, the Po of both gates was simultaneously increased by ∼6-fold (Fig. 1 and Table 2). As a result, the HBC became the limiting gate to ion flow in the presence of intracellular Na+ ions.Figure 4GIRK2 channel burst characteristics for individual gates (each vertical line per ns) over simulation time. MD simulations were run on five systems: GIRK2–Apo, GIRK2–PIP2 (GIRK2), GIRK2–Na+, GIRK2–Gβγ, and GIRK2–Gβγ–Na+. Channels with their HBC (A) and G-loop (B) gates larger than a minimum distance (5.69 Å) that is required for permeation were considered to be open. The minimum distance estimate was derived as in Fig. 1 from the least conductive system GIRK2–Na+ compared with the other two systems studied that have been shown experimentally to display measurable currents (i.e. GIRK2–Gβγ and GIRK2–Gβγ–Na+).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table 2The open probability (%) of the constrictions HBC, G-loop gate, and both for the last 350 ns that is in the equilibrium stage of MD in each simulation systemSystemsHBCG-loop gateBothGIRK2–Apo1.4354.000.29GIRK2–PIP2 (GIRK2)44.8611.714.86GIRK2–Na+35.1487.7130.57GIRK2–Gβγ80.5781.1465.43GIRK2–Gβγ–Na+86.5782.8671.14 Open table in a new tab A clear right shift of the HBC gate minimum distributions to the open direction was seen when Gβγ was included in the GIRK2–PIP2 system (Fig. 3). The effect of Gβγ on the G-loop gate also showed a right shift (compared with GIRK2–PIP2), but there was a significant component of distance distributions that Gβγ was not able to affect (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Table 2). Opening of the G-loop gate may become a rate-limiting step to the conductive state when channels get activated by Gβγ. Because this limitation was less than that imposed by the HBC gate in the GIRK2–Na+ system, a higher overall Po of the channel was achieved (Fig. 1 and Table 2). This observation is consistent with experimental results suggesting that in comparison, gating by Gβγ is greater than that by intracellular Na+ (20Petit-Jacques J. Sui J.L. Logothetis D.E. Synergistic activation of G protein–gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels by the βγ subunits of G proteins and Na+ and Mg2+ ions.J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114 (10532964): 673-68410.1085/jgp.114.5.673Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When both Gβγ and intracellular Na+ ions were included in the simulations, the distance distributions of both gates were predominantly in the open state (Fig. 3), resulting in the greatest Po (Fig. 4 and Table 2). In the presence of an EF, this condition produced the most efficient permeation of K+ ions (Table 1). These data are in good agreement with experimental results (Fig. 2) (20Petit-Jacques J. Sui J.L. Logothetis D.E. Synergistic activation of G protein–gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels by the βγ subunits of G proteins and Na+ and Mg2+ ions.J. Gen.

As discussed earlier, the only GIRK2 crystal structure depicting both the HBC and G-loop gates in the open state has been the GIRK2(R201A) + PIP2 (3SYQ) structure (8Whorton M.R. MacKinnon R. Crystal structure of the mammalian GIRK2 K+ channel and gating regulation by G proteins, PIP2, and sodium.Cell. 2011; 147 (21962516): 199-20810.1016/j.cell.2011.07.046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on our simulated trajectories to discern channel domain movements linked to gating. This analysis suggests that the HBC and G-loop gates move in opposite directions as the channel gates (Movie S1). This kind of movement is in contrast to the proposal based on the 3SYQ open structure (R201A-PIP2), in which the two gates move in the same direction. In fact, when we performed PCA on the crystal structures excluding the 3SYQ structure, similar results to our simulations were obtained, supporting a movement of the two gates in opposite directions (Movie S2). When PCA was repeated including the 3SYQ (GIRK2-R201A-PIP2), the two gates were shown to move in the same direction as previously suggested (5Whorton M.R. MacKinnon R.

These results as a whole have suggested that the GIRK2(R201A) + PIP2 mutant involves perhaps a distinct reaction path and mechanism leading to the conformational state depicted by the crystal structure and may not represent a good model of the channel open state achieved by natural gating molecules. Once the channel was gated from a pre-open to the open state, rocking movements of the CTD and tilting of the TM2 were observed (Movie S1). To quantitatively depict these movements two angles were defined: (a) a dihedral angle (TM2–CTD) formed by the Cα atoms of Ser-196 with Ile-244 and Ile-281 on one hand and with Gln-287 on the other hand and (b) a TM2 tilt angle formed by the TM2 terminal and the vertical axis of the TM domain (Fig. S5A). The larger the TM2–CTD dihedral angles the more the CTD rocks outwardly, away from the vertical axis of the TM domain. Comparison of the closed and open structures reveal an outward CTD rocking movement during opening, an outward TM2 helix tilting and local twists in the Gβγ binding βL–βM and βD2–βE1 loops (Fig. 5). 3D plots were then employed to compare the relationship between the dihedral angle, the tilt angle, and the HBC Cα distance. Fig. 6A shows clearly that as the TM2–CTD dihedral angles and the TM2 tilt angles increase (move outwards), so do the HBC Cα distances. Generally speaking, increases in both the TM2–CTD dihedral and the TM2 tilt angles translate into opening the HBC gate.Figure 6Parameters describing HBC and G-loop gate opening. A, 3D plots of TM2 helix (Val-188–Ser-196) tilt angles, TM2–CTD dihedral angles (Cα atoms of Ser-196, Ile-244, Ile-281, and Gln-287), and average HBC Cα distances.

We used the geometry center of the TMD and CTD excluding the N and C termini, as mentioned under “Experimental Procedures,” to calculate this angle and estimated it to be ∼3.68° (Fig. 7A), consistent with the previously proposed angle of 4° (5Whorton M.R.

Glutamate increased cPLA2, P-gp, and BCRP protein and activity levels in isolated brain capillaries. We confirmed the role of cPLA2 in the signaling pathway in brain capillaries from male and female mice lacking cPLA2. We also demonstrated, in vivo, that cPLA2 inhibition prevents overexpression of P-gp and BCRP at the blood-brain barrier in rats after status epilepticus and in CE rats. Our data support the hypothesis that glutamate signals cPLA2 activation, resulting in overexpression of blood-brain barrier P-gp and BCRP.-Hartz, A. M. S., Rempe, R. G., Soldner, E. L.

https://openalex.org/W2982450520,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an idiopathic, progressive cholangiopathy. Cholangiocyte senescence is important in PSC pathogenesis, and we have previously reported that senescence is regulated by the transcription factor ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1) and associated with overexpression of BCL2 like 1 (BCL2L1 or BCL-xL), an anti-apoptotic BCL2-family member. Here, we further explored the mechanisms regulating BCL-xL-mediated, apoptosis resistance in senescent cholangiocytes and uncovered that ETS1 and the histone acetyltransferase E1A-binding protein P300 (EP300 or p300) both promote BCL-xL transcription. Using immunofluorescence, we found that BCL-xL protein expression is increased both in cholangiocytes of livers from individuals with PSC and a mouse model of PSC. Using an in vitro model of lipopolysaccharide-induced senescence in normal human cholangiocytes (NHCs), we found increased BCL-xL mRNA and protein levels, and ChIP-PCRs indicated increased occupancy of ETS1, p300, and histone 3 Lys-27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) at the BCL-xL promoter. Using co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, we further demonstrate that ETS1 and p300 physically interact in senescent but not control NHCs. Additionally, mutagenesis of predicted ETS1-binding sites within the BCL-xL promoter blocked luciferase reporter activity, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic deletion of ETS1 reduced senescence-associated BCL-xL expression. In senescent NHCs, TRAIL-mediated apoptosis was reduced ∼70%, and ETS1 deletion or RNAi-mediated BCL-xL suppression increased apoptosis. Overall, our results suggest that ETS1 and p300 promote senescent cholangiocyte resistance to apoptosis by modifying chromatin and inducing BCL-xL expression. These findings reveal ETS1 as a central regulator of both cholangiocyte senescence and the associated apoptosis-resistant phenotype.

Although these data enhanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cholangiocyte senescence, they did not address other phenotypic features of senescent cholangiocytes. Senescence is frequently associated with resistance to apoptosis, which may account for the persistence of senescent cells in tissues and associated deleterious consequences (19Wang E.

We recently demonstrated in vitro that the anti-apoptotic protein, BCL2L1 (BCL-xL), is up-regulated in senescent cholangiocytes, and pharmacological inhibition of BCL-xL with the small molecule inhibitor, A1331852, selectively kills cultured senescent cholangiocytes. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of BCL-xL in the Mdr2−/− mouse diminished the number of senescent cholangiocytes and decreased liver fibrosis (24Moncsek A. Al-Suraih M.S. Trussoni C.E.

Although ETS1 has been implicated in promoting the expression of prosurvival proteins and resistance to apoptosis (25Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. EAP1/Daxx interacts with ETS1 and represses transcriptional activation of ETS1 target genes.Oncogene. 2000; 19 (10698492): 745-75310.1038/sj.onc.1203385Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 26Yu Z.

Our collective data suggest that ETS1 not only promotes cholangiocyte senescence via the up-regulation of p16INK4a, but also drives the expression of BCL-xL via the recruitment of the chromatin remodeling histone acetyltransferase, p300. These novel results provide mechanistic insight into senescent cholangiocyte apoptosis resistance, and suggest a potential pathophysiological role in the development and progression of PSC and perhaps other diseases. Moreover, pharmacologic targeting of this pathway may provide a new therapeutic strategy for PSC and other conditions where apoptosis-resistant senescent cells likely contribute to disease progression. We previously published that BCL-xL inhibition in the Mdr2−/− mouse model of PSC-depleted senescent cholangiocyte number and improved fibrosis. To extend this observation, we assessed BCL-xL protein expression by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy and confirmed that cholangiocytes from nondiseased human liver (normal control) express very little BCL-xL protein, whereas cholangiocytes from PSC patient liver tissue expressed increased BCL-xL (Fig. 1A). Quantitation of fluorescent intensity was performed and confirmed increased BCL-xL expression (∼5-fold) in PSC cholangiocytes compared with normal control cholangiocytes (Fig. 1B). Given that Mdr2−/− mice exhibit increased senescent cholangiocytes (14Tabibian J.H. O'Hara S.P. Splinter P.L. Trussoni C.E. LaRusso N.F. Cholangiocyte senescence by way of N-ras activation is a characteristic of primary sclerosing cholangitis.Hepatology. 2014; 59 (24390753): 2263-227510.1002/hep.26993Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and that BCL-xL inhibition improves fibrosis (24Moncsek A.

As with human specimens, BCL-xL was minimally expressed in cholangiocytes from WT mice, whereas expression was increased ∼3-fold in Mdr2−/− mice (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, these in vivo data confirm and extend our previous work by demonstrating up-regulated expression of the prosurvival protein, BCL-xL, in cholangiocytes in samples of liver from PSC patients and the Mdr2−/− mouse. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins may be up-regulated in senescent cells and prevent senescent cell death (20Yosef R. Pilpel N. Tokarsky-Amiel R. Biran A. Ovadya Y. Cohen S. Vadai E. Dassa L. Shahar E. Condiotti R. Ben-Porath I. Krizhanovsky V. Directed elimination of senescent cells by inhibition of BCL-W and BCL-XL.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27048913): 1119010.1038/ncomms11190Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In an effort to assess the expression of potential pro- and anti-apoptotic mediators in senescent cholangiocytes, we utilized our culture model of LPS-induced cholangiocyte senescence (14Tabibian J.H. O'Hara S.P. Splinter P.L. Trussoni C.E. LaRusso N.F. Cholangiocyte senescence by way of N-ras activation is a characteristic of primary sclerosing cholangitis.Hepatology. 2014; 59 (24390753): 2263-227510.1002/hep.26993Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated a selective increase in BCL-xL mRNA (∼8-fold), in senescent versus nonsenescent controls (Fig. 2A); other anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members were not affected. We further found that the pro-apoptotic effector, BAK1, increased ∼2-fold in senescent cholangiocytes, whereas the proapoptotic activator, Noxa, decreased (Fig. 2A). Western blotting analyses confirmed the selective up-regulation of BCL-xL and BAK1, as well as the decreased expression of BAX and NOXA in senescent cholangiocytes (Fig. 2B). To confirm the induction of cholangiocyte senescence in our culture model, we performed qPCR and Western blotting on senescence-associated gene products. qPCR confirmed that both CDKN2A (p16) and CDKN1A (p21) were up-regulated in our culture system, whereas Western blotting confirmed the up-regulation of CDKN2A, CDKN1A as well as the senescence-associated DNA damage histone mark, γH2A.X (Fig. 2C). The proliferation-associated gene product, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) also decreased (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, and as demonstrated by us previously (18O'Hara S.P. Splinter P.L. Trussoni C.E. Pisarello M.J. Loarca L. Splinter N.S. Schutte B.F. LaRusso N.F. ETS proto-oncogene 1 transcriptionally up-regulates the cholangiocyte senescence-associated protein cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A.J. Biol.

Collectively, these data suggest that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in senescent cholangiocytes is primed for mitochondrial cell death via up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic effector protein, BAK1, and support that the increased expression of the anti-apoptotic mediator, BCL-xL, may be essential to sequester BAK1 and confer the apoptosis-resistant phenotype of senescent cholangiocytes. We previously demonstrated that the Ras-responsive transcription factor, ETS1, promoted CDKN21 (p16) expression and cholangiocyte senescence following LPS treatment (18O'Hara S.P. Splinter P.L. Trussoni C.E. Pisarello M.J. Loarca L. Splinter N.S. Schutte B.F. LaRusso N.F.

We therefore asked whether the expression of BCL-xL dynamically correlated with the induction of cholangiocyte senescence and ETS1 expression in our experimentally-induced senescent cholangiocytes. Western blotting demonstrated that BCL-xL up-regulation occurred following 6 days of repeated LPS treatment, which correlates with ETS1 up-regulation and the induction of senescence as demonstrated with the induction of CDKN2A and CDKN1A (Fig. 3A). To directly assess whether the up-regulated expression of BCL-xL correlated with apoptosis resistance and senescence, we utilized our cell culture model of induced senescence and assessed apoptosis by measuring activation of caspase-3/7 and senescence by β-galactosidase positivity. Although untreated normal human cholangiocytes (NHCs) exhibited minimal apoptosis, we found that exposure to LPS induced cultured NHC apoptosis at days 1–4, but decreased on days 6–10 (Fig. 3B). Moreover, and as demonstrated previously (14Tabibian J.H. O'Hara S.P. Splinter P.L. Trussoni C.E. LaRusso N.F. Cholangiocyte senescence by way of N-ras activation is a characteristic of primary sclerosing cholangitis.Hepatology. 2014; 59 (24390753): 2263-227510.1002/hep.26993Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), β-gal activity increased at 6 days post-repeated LPS treatment, and persisted through 10 days post-repeated LPS treatment (Fig. 3C). To confirm the apoptotic-resistant phenotype we treated nonsenescent or induced senescent NHC with TRAIL. Although TRAIL treatment activates the extrinsic (death receptor-mediated) apoptotic pathway, activation of effector caspases (such as caspase-3/7) in liver epithelia (i.e. hepatocytes and cholangiocytes) requires the engagement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (27Guicciardi M.E.

We found TRAIL-induced apoptosis in nonsenescent control NHC, but not in senescent NHC and that the induction of apoptosis in nonsenescent NHC was prevented by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 3, D and E). Senescence detection remained elevated in LPS-IS cholangiocytes in both the presence and absence of TRAIL and the presence and absence of Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 3F). Together, these data continue to support an essential role of ETS1 in cholangiocyte senescence and demonstrate further that BCL-xL up-regulation correlates with the expression of ETS1, senescence induction, and the apoptosis-resistance phenotype. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (e.g. BCL-xL) either inhibit the pro-apoptotic effectors (BAK and BAX) via direct binding of their activated form or by sequestering “activator” BH3-only proteins (e.g. BIM, NOXA) and preventing their activation of BAK and BAX (22Adams J.M. Cory S. Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis: mechanism and therapeutic potential.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2007; 19 (17629468): 488-49610.1016/j.coi.2007.05.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed whether the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL directly interacted with apoptotic effectors or activators in senescent cholangiocytes. We immunoprecipitated BCL-xL from control and senescent cholangiocytes and performed immunoblotting for apoptosis activators and effectors. We found that BCL-xL formed an immunoprecipitable complex with BAK and BAX, but not BIM or NOXA (Fig. 4A). It is proposed that BCL-xL interacts with activated BAK and/or BAX, blocks oligomerization of these proapoptotic molecules, and thus prevents apoptosis (29Kale J. Osterlund E.J. Andrews D.W. BCL-2 family proteins: changing partners in the dance towards death.Cell Death Differ. 2018; 25 (29149100): 65-8010.1038/cdd.2017.186Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next immunoprecipitated activated BAK and BAX and immunoblotted for BCL-xL. We detected BCL-xL only in senescent cholangiocytes further supporting that active BAK and BAX interact with BCL-xL in senescent cholangiocytes (Fig. 4B). Finally, to determine whether the antiapoptotic protein BCL-xL interacts with BAX and BAK in human PSC liver tissue, we performed proximity ligation assays on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. This fluorescence-based approach suggests increased BAK and BAX interaction with BCL-xL in PSC cholangiocytes (Fig. 4, C and D). Together, these in vitro results support that up-regulated BCL-xL directly interacts with active BAK and BAX in senescent cholangiocytes and that this interaction is a likely mechanism for the apoptosis-resistant phenotype of senescent cholangiocytes. Furthermore, the data supports that this process occurs in cholangiocytes from PSC liver tissue. The DNA elements upstream of the BCL-xL transcriptional start site were analyzed for potential ETS1-binding sites and also analyzed for potential epigenetic regulation (i.e. histone acetylation marks). To perform these in silico analyses, we used the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) annotation data (30Rosenbloom K.R. Armstrong J. Barber G.P. Casper J. Clawson H. Diekhans M. Dreszer T.R.

https://openalex.org/W2982605793,"Cancer was recently annexed to diabetic complications. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that cancer can increase the risk of diabetes. Consequently, diabetes and cancer share many risk factors, but the cellular and molecular pathways correlating diabetes and colon and rectal cancer (CRC) remain far from understood. In this study, we assess the effect of hyperglycemia on cancer cell aggressiveness in human colon epithelial adenocarcinoma cells in vitro and in an experimental animal model of CRC. Our results show that Nox (NADPH oxidase enzyme) 4-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is deregulated in both diabetes and CRC. This is paralleled by inactivation of the AMPK and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 signaling pathways, resulting in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) accumulation, induction of DNA damage, and exacerbation of cancer cell aggressiveness, thus contributing to the genomic instability and predisposition to increased tumorigenesis in the diabetic milieu. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK, inhibition of mTORC1, or blockade of Nox4 reduce ROS production, restore the homeostatic signaling of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/8-oxodG, and lessen the progression of CRC malignancy in a diabetic milieu. Taken together, our results identify the AMPK/mTORC1/Nox4 signaling axis as a molecular switch correlating diabetes and CRC. Modulating this pathway may be a strategic target of therapeutic potential aimed at reversing or slowing the progression of CRC in patients with or without diabetes.-Mroueh, F.

The glycocalyx (GCX), a carbohydrate‐rich layer lining the endothelium, is crucial in vascular homeostasis. To evaluate the role of its loss in the pathogenesis of pediatric CM, we measured GCX degradation in Tanzanian children with World Health Organization‐defined CM ( n = 55), uncomplicated malaria (UM; n = 20), and healthy controls (HCs; n = 25). Urine GCX breakdown products [glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)] were quantified using dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) and liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry assays. DMMB‐GAG and mass spectrometry (MS)‐GAG (g/mol creatinine) were increased in CM and UM compared with HCs ( P &lt; 0.001), with no differences in DMMB‐GAG and MS‐GAG between CM and UM children or between those with and without a fatal outcome. In CM survivors, urinary GCX DMMB‐GAG normalized by d 3. After adjusting for disease severity, DMMB‐GAG was significantly associated with parasitemia [partial correlation coefficient ( P corr ) = 0.34; P = 0.01] and plasma TNF ( P corr = 0.26; P = 0.04) and inversely with plasma and urine NO oxidation products [ P corr = ‐0.31 ( P = 0.01) and P corr = ‐0.26 ( P = 0.03), respectively]. GCX breakdown is increased in children with falciparum malaria, with similar elevations in CM and UM.

https://openalex.org/W2982709273,"Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy (CSM) is a common spinal condition that presents as hyperreflexia, loss of dexterity, and strength. Despite its prevalence, little is known about the specific neuromechanical deficits that constitute overall disability in CSM. Compression on MRI doesn’t exclusively relate to disability. Moreover, clinical assessment often relies on the subjective exams and self-reported questionnaires. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess hyperreflexia, proprioception, and loss of strength, and its association with common MRI scales. Methods Twenty patients with CSM and 17 controls were recruited. Clinical scores of modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) and Nurick were collected. MRI based compression grades such as cord distortion were assessed. Hand dysfunction was tested using a custom motorized apparatus. Subject’s forearm was placed in a cast and positioned such that their metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint was vertically aligned with the motor shaft. Surface electromyographic sensors were placed on flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and extensor digitorum communis muscles. Hyperreflexia was measured as the FDS muscle activation during reflex when the MCP joint was moved from flexion to extension at 300°/sec. Proprioception was quantified as the angle of detection in absence of visual or auditory cues (subjects were blindfolded and given noise-cancelling headphones). Strength was measured as the maximum isometric force at the MCP joint. 2-sample t-test (p<0.05) were performed to assess significant differences in reflexes, proprioception and strength among patients and controls (SPSS software version 24). Results Patients reported higher Nurick (1.90±1.0 vs 0±0, p<0.001) and lower mJOA scores (14.3±1.9 vs 18.0±0, p<0.001) as compared to controls. Similarly, patients with CSM had increased reflexes (peak FDS EMG) (0.073±0.096 vs. 0.014±0.010, p = 0.019). Patient proprioception was significantly worse; mean angle of detection was greater than twice as high in patients (9.6± 9.43°) compared to controls (4.0± 2.3°), p = 0.022. MRI based compression ratio (CR) was a significant predictor of hyperreflexia, CR<0.44 resulted in steep increase in reflex activity. Fifteen of the 20 patients who completed follow up testing at 6 months after surgery show substantial clinical improvement in reflexes and proprioceptive angle, while repeated testing in controls were unchanged. Conclusion In conclusion, hyperreflexia and decline in proprioception are the main drivers of hand disability in patients with CSM. Of multiple scales, only a select few MRI scales (such as compression ratio) were predictive of increased reflexes. The study describes a pre-clinical testing apparatus to quantitatively and objectively assess primary presenting symptoms in CSM. This pilot apparatus has the potential to evaluate treatment efficacy through repeated testing. Objective testing of hand dysfunction can help inform the design of clinically feasible devices, guide MRI biomarker analysis, and improve our understanding of the progression of neurological injury in this patient population."

Design A prospective observational study of patients with sepsis, infection only and healthy controls. Setting The acute medical wards and intensive care units in a 1000 bed university hospital. Patients 32 patients with sepsis, 20 patients with infection, and 20 healthy controls. Patients and controls were older than 65 years of age. Patients with recognised underlying immune compromise were excluded. Methods Phenotype, differentiation status and cytokine production by T lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometry. Measurements The differentiation states of circulating CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells were characterised as naive (CD45RA+, CD197+), central memory (CD45RA-, CD197+), effector memory (CD45RA-, CD197-), or terminally differentated (CD45RA+, CD197-). Expression of IL-12 and IL-23 receptors, and the transcription factors T-bet and RORγt, was analysed in circulating T lymphocytes. Expression of interferon- γ and IL-17A were analysed following stimulation in vitro. Results CD4+ T cells from patients with infection predominantly expressed effector-memory or terminally differentiated phenotypes but CD4+ T cells from patients with severe sepsis predominantly expressed naive phenotypes (p<0.0001). CD4+ T cells expressing IL-23 receptor were lower in patients with sepsis compared to patients with infection alone (p = 0.007). RORγt expression by CD4+ T cells was less frequent in patients with sepsis (p<0.001), whereas T-bet expressing CD8+ T cells that do not express RORγt was lower in the sepsis patients. HLA-DR expression by monocytes was lower in patients with sepsis. In septic patients fewer monocytes expressed IL-23. Conclusion Persistent failure of T cell activation was observed in patients with sepsis. Sepsis was associated with attenuated CD8+Th1 and CD4+Th17 based lymphocyte response."
https://openalex.org/W2981895301,"Studies on plasticity at the level of a single individual plant provide indispensable information to predict leaf responses to climate change, because they allow better identification of the environmental factors that determine differences in leaf traits in the absence of genetic differences. Most of these studies have focused on the responses of leaf traits to variations in the light environment along vertical gradients, thus paying less attention to possible differences in the intensity of water stress among canopy orientations. In this paper, we analyzed the differences in leaf traits traditionally associated with changes in the intensity of water stress between east and west crown orientations in three Quercus species. The leaves facing west experienced similar solar radiation levels but higher maximum temperatures and lower daily minimum water potentials than those of the east orientation. In response to these differences, the leaves of the west orientation showed smaller size and less chlorophyll concentration, higher percentage of palisade tissue and higher density of stomata and trichomes. These responses would confirm the role of such traits in the tolerance to water stress and control of water losses by transpiration. For all traits, the species with the longest leaf life span exhibited the greatest plasticity between orientations. By contrast, no differences between canopy positions were observed for leaf thickness, leaf mass per unit area and venation patterns."

We compared the effects of SGLT2is with those of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is) on the risk of diabetic retinopathy and its progression in people with type 2 diabetes. We performed a retrospective cohort study among people with type 2 diabetes who started on a SGLT2i or DPP4i from 2014 to 2016 according to the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Subjects initiated on a SGLT2i or DPP4i were matched on a 1:1 basis according to their propensity scores, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate the hazard ratios for the risk of diabetic retinopathy and its progression. After propensity score-matching, 41,430 patients without a history of diabetic retinopathy were identified as new users of a SGLT2i (n = 20,175) or DPP4i (n = 20,175). The hazard ratio (95% CI) for diabetic retinopathy was 0.89 (0.83–0.97) for SGLT2i initiators compared with DPP4i initiators. In patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy (n = 4,663 pairs), there was no significant difference in diabetic retinopathy progression between SGLT2i initiators and DPP4i initiators (hazard ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.78–1.13). This real-world cohort study showed that SGLT2is might be associated with lower risk of diabetic retinopathy compared with DPP4is. Randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate the long-term effect of SGLT2is in diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes."

We report a new high-resolution system to measure the stable carbon isotopic composition of carboxyl atoms within amino acids. The automated system used HPLC to separate amino acids followed by addition of ninhydrin for decarboxylation and transfer of the evolved CO2 to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer for δ13CCARBOXYL measurement. The ninhydrin reaction was conducted at acidic pH (1.5) and elevated temperature (160 oC) giving yields close to 100% for most common amino acids. Eight mammalian keratin samples from herbivores (kudu and caribou), omnivores (humans) and carnivores (bowhead and humpback zooplanktivorous whales) were analysed with this new system. The data provide an initial calibration of reference materials to be used in studies of this type and is the first report of carboxyl carbon isotope distributions in mammals. Results showed widespread 13C enrichments in both essential and non-essential amino acid carboxyl groups, likely linked to decarboxylation of amino acids during normal metabolism. Analyses of non-essential amino acid isotope profiles showed (1) consistent and general taxon-level metabolic differences between the herbivore, human and whale samples, (2) marked differences among individual humans, ruminants and whales (3) evidence for gluconeogenesis in the wildlife samples, and (4) extensive 13C enrichment likely associated with fasting in the humpback whale sample. Future mammalian research related to the metabolism of growth, reproduction, aging and disease may benefit from using this technique. Values obtained for internationally available samples USGS42 and USGS43 (Tibetan and Indian human hair) provide a first characterization of reference materials for δ13CCARBOXYL profiles."

They are model systems for analyzing RNA-ligand interactions and are established targets for antibacterial agents. Many studies have analyzed the ligand-binding properties of riboswitches, but this work has outpaced our understanding of the underlying chemical pathways that govern riboswitch-controlled gene expression. To address this knowledge gap, we prepared 15 mutants of the preQ1-II riboswitch—a structurally and biochemically well-characterized HLout pseudoknot that recognizes the metabolite prequeuosine1 (preQ1). The mutants span the preQ1-binding pocket through the adjoining Shine–Dalgarno sequence (SDS) and include A-minor motifs, pseudoknot-insertion helix P4, U·A-U base triples, and canonical G-C pairs in the anti-SDS. As predicted—and confirmed by in vitro isothermal titration calorimetry measurements—specific mutations ablated preQ1 binding, but most aberrant binding effects were corrected by compensatory mutations. In contrast, functional analysis in live bacteria using a riboswitch-controlled GFPuv-reporter assay revealed that each mutant had a deleterious effect on gene regulation, even when compensatory changes were included. Our results indicate that effector binding can be uncoupled from gene regulation. We attribute loss of function to defects in a chemical interaction network that links effector binding to distal regions of the fold that support the gene-off RNA conformation.

The phenotype of the Dazl knockout mouse has extensive germ cell loss because of incomplete meiosis. We have created a Dazl hypomorph model using short interfering RNA knockdown in mouse fetal ovary cultures, allowing investigation of Dazl function in germ cell maturation. Dazl hypomorph ovaries had a phenotype of impaired germ cell nest breakdown with a 66% reduction in total follicle number and an increase in the proportion of primordial follicles (PMFs), with smaller oocytes within these follicles. There was no significant early germ cell loss or meiotic delay. Immunostaining of intercellular bridge component testis‐expressed protein (Tex)14 showed ~59°/o reduction in foci number and size, without any change in Tex14 mRNA levels. TEX14 expression was also confirmed in the human fetal ovary across gestation. Using 3'UTR‐luciferase reporter assays, translational regulation of TEX14 was demonstrated to be DAZL‐dependant.

https://openalex.org/W2982062141,"Objectives To examine the topographical correlation between ellipsoid zone loss and telangiectasia in the deep capillary plexus in patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel). Methods 38 eyes (20 subjects) diagnosed with MacTel were imaged with OCTA between March 2016 and June 2019 in this single center, cross-sectional observational study. The en face OCTA and OCT were evaluated for areas of deep capillary plexus telangiectasia and ellipsoid zone loss, respectively, and their outlines were superimposed to study their overlap (mm2). The primary outcome was percentage of overlap and its relationship to MacTel stage. Secondary outcomes included the relationship between neovascularization and hyperreflective foci as well as correlations between ellipsoid zone loss, deep capillary plexus telangiectasia and visual acuity. Results In nonproliferative MacTel stage, ellipsoid zone loss was localized to margins of telangiectatic areas (mean overlap = 15.2%). In proliferative stages, ellipsoid zone loss showed a higher degree of overlap with telangiectatic areas (mean overlap = 62.8%). Overlap increased with advancing MacTel stages, with an overall average of 45.3%. Overlap correlated highly with ellipsoid zone loss (r = 0.831; p<0.0001). Telangiectasia was present in all 38 eyes (range: 0.08mm2–0.99mm2), while ellipsoid zone loss was absent in 6 (range: 0.00–3.32mm2). Visual acuity correlated most strongly with ellipsoid zone loss (r = 0.569; p = 0.0002), followed by overlap (r = 0.544; p = 0.0004), and finally, telangiectasia (r = 0.404; p<0.0118). Presence of hyperreflective foci on OCT correlated with the presence and intraretinal location of neovascularization. Conclusions Ellipsoid zone loss occurs at the margins of deep capillary plexus telangiectasia in nonproliferative MacTel, with progressively increasing overlap as MacTel advances, peaking in proliferative disease. Deep capillary plexus telangiectasia and its overlap with ellipsoid zone loss are two promising markers of nonproliferative MacTel, while hyper-reflective foci are markers for proliferative MacTel."

Therefore, a marker of response would be beneficial for clinical decision-making. We evaluated class III β-tubulin (βIII-tubulin) expression as a predictor of resistance in this setting, which previously has been correlated with lack of response to taxanes in other cancers. Patients with CRPC were included if they were treated with at least 3 cycles of docetaxel between 1990 and 2011. βIII-tubulin expression was assessed by immunostaining, which was performed in tissue samples obtained either via biopsy or prostatectomy at the time of diagnosis. Rates of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and overall survival (OS) following docetaxel treatment were compared between patients with high (2+ or 3+ staining) vs. low (0 or 1+ staining) βIII-tubulin expression. Of 73 patients, 26 (35%) had a high expression of βIII-tubulin. A PSA decline of 10% or greater occurred in 65% of patients with a high βIII-tubulin expression vs. 89% with a low βIII-tubulin expression (p = 0.0267). The median OS for patients with a high βIII-tubulin expression was 17.4 (95% CI 8.7-21.0) months vs. 19.8 (95% CI 16.6-23.6) months for patients with a low expression (p = 0.039).

The β3-subunit uses its transmembrane α-helix and extracellular domain to bind to Nav1.5. Here, we investigated the role of an unusually located and highly conserved glutamic acid (Glu-176) within the β3 transmembrane region and its potential for functionally synergizing with the β3 extracellular domain (ECD). We substituted Glu-176 with lysine (E176K) in the WT β3-subunit and in a β3-subunit lacking the ECD. Patch-clamp experiments indicated that the E176K substitution does not affect the previously observed β3-dependent depolarizing shift of V½ of steady-state inactivation but does attenuate the accelerated recovery from inactivation conferred by the WT β3-subunit. Removal of the β3-ECD abrogated both the depolarizing shift of steady-state inactivation and the accelerated recovery, irrespective of the presence or absence of the Glu-176 residue. We found that steady-state inactivation and recovery from inactivation involve movements of the S4 helices within the DIII and DIV voltage sensors in response to membrane potential changes. Voltage-clamp fluorometry revealed that the E176K substitution alters DIII voltage sensor dynamics without affecting DIV. In contrast, removal of the ECD significantly altered the dynamics of both DIII and DIV. These results imply distinct roles for the β3-Glu-176 residue and the β3-ECD in regulating the conformational changes of the voltage sensors that determine channel inactivation and recovery from inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2982462956,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) are endoplasmic reticulum–localized channels that mediate Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. We previously reported that an EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein, neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS1), binds to the InsP3R and thereby increases channel open probability, an event associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. However, the exact NCS1-binding site on InsP3R remains unknown. Using protein docking, co-immunoprecipitation, and blocking peptides, we mapped the NCS1-binding site to residues 66–110 on the suppressor domain of InsP3R type 1 (InsP3R1). We also identified Leu-89, a residue in the hydrophobic pocket of NCS1, as being critical for facilitating the NCS1–InsP3R1 interaction. Overexpression of WT NCS1 in MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells increased Ca2+ signaling and survival, whereas overexpression of Leu-89 NCS1 variants decreased Ca2+ signaling and survival, further suggesting the importance of this residue in the NCS1–InsP3R1 interaction. In conclusion, we show that NCS1–InsP3R1 interaction enhances intracellular Ca2+ signaling in cells and can be modulated by altering or occluding the hydrophobic pocket of NCS1. This improved understanding of the NCS1–InsP3R1 interaction may facilitate the development of management strategies for diseases resulting from aberrant NCS1 expression.

Overexpression of WT NCS1 in MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells increased Ca2+ signaling and survival, whereas overexpression of Leu-89 NCS1 variants decreased Ca2+ signaling and survival, further suggesting the importance of this residue in the NCS1–InsP3R1 interaction. In conclusion, we show that NCS1–InsP3R1 interaction enhances intracellular Ca2+ signaling in cells and can be modulated by altering or occluding the hydrophobic pocket of NCS1. This improved understanding of the NCS1–InsP3R1 interaction may facilitate the development of management strategies for diseases resulting from aberrant NCS1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2982633557,"Plant-pollinator networks have been repeatedly reported as cumulative ones that are described with >1 years observations. However, such cumulative networks are composed of pairwise interactions recorded at different periods, and thus may not be able to reflect the reality of species interactions in nature (e.g., early-flowering plants typically do not compete for shared pollinators with late-flowering plants, but they are assumed to do so in accumulated networks). Here, we examine the monthly sampling structure of an alpine plant-pollinator bipartite network over a two-year period to determine whether relative species abundance and species traits better explain the network structure of monthly networks than yearly ones. Although community composition and species abundance varied from one month to another, the monthly networks (as well as the yearly networks described with annual pooled data) had a highly nested structure, in which specialists directly interact with generalist partners. Moreover, relative species abundance predicted the nestedness in both the monthly and yearly networks and accounted for a statistically significant percentage of the variation (i.e., 20%-44%) in the pairwise interactions of monthly networks, but not yearly networks. The combination of relative species abundance and species traits (but not species traits only) showed a similar prediction power in terms of both network nestedness and pairwise interaction frequencies. Considering the previously recognized structural pattern and associated mechanisms of plant-pollinator networks, we propose that relative species abundance may be an important factor influencing both nestedness and interaction frequency of pollination networks."
https://openalex.org/W2982637881,"Objectives Various maternal mental disorders and socioeconomic status [SES] are discussed as risk factors for early childhood caries [ECC]. In our study, we examined a wide range of symptoms of mental disorders with the aim to identify those maternal psychopathological symptom burdens [PSBs] which show relevant associations with ECC. Our second objective was to investigate how SES affects the associations between PSB and ECC. Methods In this study, sixty children with ECC (caries group [CG]) and sixty caries-free children [NON-CG] with their mothers were recruited at two sites in Germany. Children aged three or four years were included in the study. Children’s dental status [dmf-t] and plaque index were recorded, and mothers answered a multidimensional SES index (including education, profession and income) as well as screening questionnaires capturing dental anxiety, depressive disorders, generalized anxiety, somatic symptom burden, eating disorders, traumatic childhood experiences, nicotine dependency and alcohol dependency. Results Mothers of the CG reported significantly higher dental anxiety (dCohen = 0.66), childhood trauma (dCohen = 0.53) and nicotine dependency (dCohen = 0.64) than the NON-CG. However, mediator analyses showed that these effects were partly mediated by the SES. Mothers of the CG had a significantly lower SES (dCohen = 0.93); with education as strongest predictor of dental status. The groups did not differ significantly in symptoms of depressiveness, subjective somatic symptom burden, alcohol dependency, eating disorders, and generalized anxiety. Conclusions Several PSBs are associated with ECC, however the SES as the strongest influencing factor mediates this association. Difficult socioeconomic conditions might predispose for both, ECC and mental illness. Targeted strategies are needed to facilitate the use of preventive measures and dental health services especially in families of lower status. For this purpose, psychosocial risk constellations must be identified. More integrative, multifactorial oriented research is necessary to gain a bio-psycho-social understanding of ECC."
https://openalex.org/W2981398720,"The sophistication of gene prediction algorithms and the abundance of RNA-based evidence for the maize genome may suggest that manual curation of gene models is no longer necessary. However, quality metrics generated by the MAKER-P gene annotation pipeline identified 17,225 of 130,330 (13%) protein-coding transcripts in the B73 Reference Genome V4 gene set with models of low concordance to available biological evidence. Working with eight graduate students, we used the Apollo annotation editor to curate 86 transcript models flagged by quality metrics and a complimentary method using the Gramene gene tree visualizer. All of the triaged models had significant errors-including missing or extra exons, non-canonical splice sites, and incorrect UTRs. A correct transcript model existed for about 60% of genes (or transcripts) flagged by quality metrics; we attribute this to the convention of elevating the transcript with the longest coding sequence (CDS) to the canonical, or first, position. The remaining 40% of flagged genes resulted in novel annotations and represent a manual curation space of about 10% of the maize genome (~4,000 protein-coding genes). MAKER-P metrics have a specificity of 100%, and a sensitivity of 85%; the gene tree visualizer has a specificity of 100%. Together with the Apollo graphical editor, our double triage provides an infrastructure to support the community curation of eukaryotic genomes by scientists, students, and potentially even citizen scientists."
https://openalex.org/W2982340441,"Schistosomes are obligate helminths responsible for over 218 million cases of human schistosomiasis in 78 countries around the world. Infection occurs when free-swimming cercariae penetrate human skin and initiate developmental progression into parasitic obligate worms that consume red blood cells. Transcriptomic studies of infectious cercariae reveal abundant mRNAs associated with energy metabolism and host invasion. However, the cercaria is mostly transcriptionally quiescent, suggesting that most mRNAs are primed prior to cercarial escape from the snail host. The use of transcriptomics to understand protein expression presumes that transcription and translation are functionally coupled and the cercarial stage has categorically been treated as a single unit for -omic analysis. Per contra, the relationship between transcription and translation in infectious cercariae has not been described. To understand the correlation between transcription and translation in cercariae, we separately measured nascent translation levels in cercarial heads, cercarial tails and in the developing schistosomula, the next stage of its life cycle. The loss of the cercarial tail is essential for the transformation from a cercaria to a schistosomulum. We observed that translation was initially limited and the translation rate accelerated during the first 72-hours after tail loss. When we tested nascent translation in cercarial heads, cercarial tails, whole cercariae, and 4-hour schistosomula, we found that translation is significantly upregulated in the cercarial tail when compared to the cercarial head and that translation was undetectable in heads using immunofluorescent image quantification (p = .0005). These data represent a major shift in how we understand the cercarial stage. The cercarial head is mostly transcriptionally and translationally quiescent while being sufficient for progression into a schistosomulum. In addition, transcription and translation are not linked in Schistosoma mansoni cercaria. Thus, our current conceptual approach of treating the cercaria as a single functional unit for -omic studies may be insufficient to understand cercarial development."
https://openalex.org/W2981743254,"Inactive fusion variants of the CRISPR-Cas9 system are increasingly being used as standard methodology to study transcription regulation. Their ability to readily manipulate the native genomic loci is particularly advantageous. In this work, we serendipitously uncover the key cytokine IL6 as an off-target of the activating derivative of CRISPR (CRISPRa) while studying RP11-326A19.4, a novel long-non coding RNA (lncRNA). Increasing RP11-326A19.4 expression in HEK293T cells via CRISPRa-mediated activation of its promoter region induced genome-wide transcriptional changes, including upregulation of IL6, an important cytokine. IL6 was increased in response to distinct sgRNA targeting the RP11-326A19.4 promoter region, suggesting specificity. Loss of the cognate sgRNA recognition sites failed to abolish CRISPRa mediated activation of IL6 however, pointing to off-target effects. Bioinformatic approaches did not reveal predicted off-target binding sites. Off-target activation of IL6 was sustained and involved low level activation of known IL6 regulators. Increased IL6 remained sensitive to further activation by TNFα, consistent with the existence of independent mechanisms. This study provides experimental evidence that CRISPRa has discrete, unpredictable off-targeting limitations that must be considered when using this emerging technology."
https://openalex.org/W2982579158,"Myocarditis can lead to myocyte loss and myocardial fibrosis resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). Currently employed methods for assessing the risk for development of DCMP are inaccurate or rely on invasive myocardial biopsies. We hypothesized that molecular imaging of tissue inflammation with contrast enhanced ultrasound during peak inflammation in myocarditis could predict development of fibrosis and impaired left ventricular function.Experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) was induced in Balbc mice by injection of the α-myosin heavy chain peptide. Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEU) using microbubbles targeted to leukocytes (MBLc), to CD4+ lymphocytes (MBCD4), and to the endothelial cell adhesion molecule P-selectin (MBPSel) was performed during the expected EAM peak inflammatory activity 21 days after induction. High resolution ultrasound, invasive hemodynamic measurements and fibrosis quantification were done 63 days after EAM assessment. All tested microbubbles correlated to fibrosis (MBLc spearman r 0.28, p 0.047, MBCD4 r 0.44, p 0.01, MBPSel r 0.73, p 0.02), however, correlations were weak overall and the spread of data was considerable. Also, targeted CEU data on day 21 did not correlate to hemodynamic and functional data on day 63.Ultrasound molecular imaging using targeted microbubbles during the peak inflammatory activity of myocarditis correlates weakly with later development of fibrosis but not with hemodynamic or left ventricular functional parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2982682461,"Groundwater-surface water interactions drive water quality in both streams and the coastal ocean, where groundwater discharge occurs in streams as baseflow and along the coastline as submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Groundwater contributions to streams and to the coastal ocean were quantified in three urban streams in Kāneʻohe Watershed, Hawaiʻi. We used radon as a groundwater tracer to show that baseflow contributions to streams ranged from 22 to 68% along their reaches leading to the coast of Kāneʻohe Bay. Total SGD was 4,500, 18,000, and 23,000 m3/day for the northwest, central, and southern sectors of the bay, respectively. Total groundwater (stream baseflow + SGD) dissolved nutrient fluxes were significantly greater than those sourced from stream surface runoff. The studied streams exhibited increasing nutrient levels downstream from groundwater inputs with high nutrient concentrations, negatively impacting coastal water quality. SGD dynamics were also assessed during the anomalously high perigean spring tides in 2017, where SGD was four times greater during the perigean spring tide compared to a spring tide and resulted in strong shifts in N:P ratios, suggesting that rising sea level stands may disrupt primary productivity with greater frequency. This study demonstrates the importance of considering baseflow inputs to streams to coastal groundwater budgets and suggests that coastal water quality may be improved through management and reduction of groundwater contaminants."
https://openalex.org/W2982480066,"The Standard Genetic Code (SGC) is robust to mutational errors such that frequently occurring mutations minimally alter the physio-chemistry of amino acids. The apparent correlation between the evolutionary distances among codons and the physio-chemical distances among their cognate amino acids suggests an early co-diversification between the codons and amino acids. Here we formulated the co-minimization of evolutionary distances between codons and physio-chemical distances between amino acids as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and solved it with a Hopfield neural network. In this unsupervised learning algorithm, macromolecules (e.g., tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases) associating codons with amino acids were considered biological analogs of Hopfield neurons associating ""tour cities"" with ""tour positions"". The Hopfield network efficiently yielded an abundance of genetic codes that were more error-minimizing than SGC and could thus be used to design artificial genetic codes. We further argue that as a self-optimization algorithm, the Hopfield neural network provides a model of origin of SGC and other adaptive molecular systems through evolutionary learning."
https://openalex.org/W2982652748,"Coal gangue has the shortcomings of low calorific value and refractory burnout, while polyvinyl chloride has the advantages of a long combustion process and high calorific value. In order to make up for these shortcomings of coal gangue, the possibility of a treatment method based on co-combustion of coal gangue with polyvinyl chloride, which can be centrally recovered from municipal solid waste, is proposed. In order to analyze the combustion effect of a mixture of these two substances, experimental samples were prepared by mixing these two substances in three different ratios, and they were tested by thermogravimetric analysis. The experimental results were compared, analyzed and evaluated. The effects of the proportion of polyvinyl chloride in the mixture on the temperature parameters, activation energy, and interaction during co-combustion were analyzed. In order to analyze the interaction during co-combustion of the two, a coupling analysis method for mixed combustion is presented, and the effectiveness of this method is verified by comparing with the correlation analysis results of co-combustion. The results show that co-combustion can mitigate the ignition difficulty and burnout of coal gangue. When the proportion of polyvinyl chloride in the mixture was increased from 20% to 80%, the maximum weightlessness rate of the first stage rapidly increased from 4.5%/min to 15.6%/min; however, that of the second stage slowly increased from 3.7%/min to 4.2%/min. A 20% proportion of polyvinyl chloride showed the most significant promotion of co-combustion, with a maximum coupling coefficient of 0.00318, which was 1.11 and 1.35 times greater than that of 50% and 80% proportions, respectively. Co-combustion can reduce the activation energy of coal gangue during the initial and end stages. Therefore, co-combustion is helpful to improve the problems of low calorific value and refractory burnout of coal gangue."
https://openalex.org/W2981633796,"The extraordinarily strong non-covalent interaction between biotin and avidin (kD = 10-14-10-16) has permitted this interaction to be used in a wide variety of experimental contexts. The Biotin Acceptor Peptide (BAP), a 15 amino acid motif that can be biotinylated by the E. coli BirA protein, has been fused to proteins-of-interest, making them substrates for in vivo biotinylation. Here we report on the construction and characterization of a modified BirA bearing signals for secretion and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention, for use in experimental contexts requiring biotinylation of secreted proteins. When expressed in the Drosophila female germline or ovarian follicle cells under Gal4-mediated transcriptional control, the modified BirA protein could be detected and shown to be enzymatically active in ovaries and progeny embryos. Surprisingly, however, it was not efficiently retained in the ER, and instead appeared to be secreted. To determine whether this secreted protein, now designated secBirA, could biotinylate secreted proteins, we generated BAP-tagged versions of two secreted Drosophila proteins, Torsolike (Tsl) and Gastrulation Defective (GD), which are normally expressed maternally and participate in embryonic pattern formation. Both Tsl-BAP and GD-BAP were shown to exhibit normal patterning activity. Co-expression of Tsl-BAP together with secBirA in ovarian follicle cells resulted in its biotinylation, which permitted its isolation from both ovaries and progeny embryos using Avidin-coupled affinity matrix. In contrast, co-expression with secBirA in the female germline did not result in detectable biotinylation of GD-BAP, possibly because the C-terminal location of the BAP tag made it inaccessible to BirA in vivo. Our results indicate that secBirA directs biotinylation of proteins bound for secretion in vivo, providing access to powerful experimental approaches for secreted proteins-of-interest. However, efficient biotinylation of target proteins may vary depending upon the location of the BAP tag or other structural features of the protein."
