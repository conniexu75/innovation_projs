https://openalex.org/W2038265624,"Using lacl-Z fusion strains of Escherichia coli we have devised systems that detect deletions of varying lengths. We examined deletions 700-1000 base pairs long, and genetically characterized over 250 spontaneous deletions. Of these, we analyzed 24 by direct DNA sequencing and 18 by inspection of restriction fragment patterns. Deletions of this size occur almost exclusively at short repeated sequences in both (recA+ and recA- strain backgrounds, but are detected 25-fold more frequently in a recA+ background. The frequency of deletion formation correlates with the extent of homology between the short repeated sequences, although other factors may be involved. The largest hotspot, which accounts for 60% of the deletions detected, involves the largest homology in the system (14 of 17 base pairs). Altering a single base pair within this homology reduces deletion incidence by an order of magnitude. We discuss possible mechanisms of deletion formation and consider its relationship to the excision of transposable elements."

https://openalex.org/W2047122757,"The single-stranded activity of S1-nuclease cleaves globin chromatin in red cell nuclei in specific regions. The cleavages are observed only in tissues in which the globin genes are active, and they ""switch"" to reflect the switching pattern of globin-gene expression in embryonic and adult red cells. The positions of the S1 cleavages in the beta- and alpha-globin chromatin correspond to the general region of known DNAase I-hypersensitive sites, but can be distinguished in detail. When DNA segments containing these regions are subcloned into pBR322 and the supercoiled molecules are treated with S1, similar sites are cleaved in the purified supercoiled (but not linear) recombinant plasmid DNA. However, the dominant S1 cutting sites are shifted in the plasmid vis-a-vis the chromatin. We believe that some aspect of DNA sequence is translated into an altered DNA structure in chromatin and that it is this altered structure that is recognized by s1 nuclease and possibly by certain chromosomal proteins. Several physical properties reflected in the S1 digestion of supercoiled plasmids suggest a mechanism for generating differences in daughter cells during development."
https://openalex.org/W2049338606,"For unknown reasons, humans infected with the bacterium Bordetella pertussis are exceptionally vulnerable to secondary infections. Bordetella species elaborate a soluble, heat-stable, and highly active adenylate cyclase. This enzyme is internalized by phagocytic cells and catalyzes the unregulated formation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), thereby disrupting normal cellular function. This unusual phenomenon may explain Bordetella-induced aphylaxis and may prove to be useful for investigating a variety of cyclic AMP-governed processes."
https://openalex.org/W2068097279,"We have examined the chromatin structure of the centromere regions of chromosomes III and XI in yeast by using cloned functional centromere DNAs (CEN3 and CEN11) as labeled probes. When chromatin from isolated nuclei is digested with micrococcal nuclease and the resulting DNA fragments separated electrophoretically and blotted to nitrocellulose filters, the centromeric nucleosomal sub-units are resolved into significantly more distinct ladders than are those from the bulk of the chromatin. A discrete protected region of 220–250 bp of CEN sequence flanked by highly nuclease-sensitive sites was revealed by mapping the exact nuclease cleavage sites within the centromeric chromatin. On both sides of this protected region, highly phased and specific nuclease cutting sites exist at nucleosomal intervals (160 bp) for a total length of 12–15 nucleosomal subunits. The central protected region in the chromatin of both centromeres spans the 130 bp segment that exhibits the highest degree of sequence homology (71%) between functional CEN3 and CEN11 DNAs. This unique chromatin structure is maintained on CEN sequences introduced into yeast on autonomously replicating plasmids, but is not propagated through foreign DNA sequences flanking the inserted yeast DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1482624499,"Hybrid interferon DNA recombinants were constructed from the IFLrA and IFLrD leukocyte interferon-coding sequences. Each of the hybrid interferons was purified with the use of a monoclonal antibody to human leukocyte interferon. Three amino acid residues were identified, one or all of which function to potentiate antiviral activity on feline cells and reduce activity on human cells. Because at sufficiently high concentrations human interferons can interact with mouse and rat receptors, it is apparent that the species barrier is only relative and that interferons can be forced into heterologous receptors by mass action. In addition, the specific molecular antiviral and antiproliferative activities (molecules of interferon/cell required for a specific effect) for each of these interferons were determined. The specific molecular activities permit an accurate comparison of the efficacy of different interferons for a specific effect. Because the ratios of antiproliferative/antiviral activity of these interferons vary over a 12-fold range, it appears that the antiviral and antiproliferative activities are promulgated through different mechanisms. To account for these results, it is proposed that there are at least two distinct interferon receptors on cells."
https://openalex.org/W2008075900,"T4 endonuclease VII cleaves Holliday structures in vitro by cutting two strands of the same polarity at or near the branch point. The two unbranched duplexes produced by cleavage each contain a strand break that can be sealed by DNA ligase. This suggests that the cut sites are at the same position in the nucleotide sequence in each strand. The joint action of endonuclease VII and DNA ligase can therefore resolve Holliday structures into genetically sensible products. These observations account for the role of endonuclease VII in the DNA metabolism of phage T4, and provide the first example of an enzyme that acts specifically on branch points in duplex DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2026336642,Harvey murine sarcoma virus is a retrovirus which transforms cells by means of a single virally encoded protein called p21 has. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of 1.0 kilobase in the 5' half of the viral genome which encompasses the has coding sequences and its associated regulatory signals. The nucleotide sequence has identified the amino acid sequence of two additional overlapping polypeptides which share their reading frames and the carboxyl termini with p21 but which contain additional NH2-terminal amino acids.
https://openalex.org/W2065744098,The transforming protein of Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (Ki-MuSV) is a virally encoded 21-kilodalton protein called p21 kis. The sequences encoding p21 kis were genetically localized to a 1.3-kilobase segment near the 5' end of the viral genome by assaying the capacity of a series of defined deletion mutants of molecularly cloned Ki-MuSV DNA to induce focal transformation of mouse cells. Nucleotide sequencing of a portion of this region has led to the identification of an open reading frame of 567 nucleotides coding for p21 kis protein.
https://openalex.org/W2083468529,"The putative transforming protein of avian myelocytomatosis virus MC29 is a 110,000 dalton (P110gag-myc) polyprotein comprised of sequences derived from both the gag region and the MC29-specific myc region. Two approaches have been taken to determine the location of the MC29 gag-related proteins in transformed cells: subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence. Analysis of subcellular fractions of MC29-transformed cells by immunoprecipitation indicates that the majority of the gag-myc polyprotein is found in the nuclear fractions of Q8 cells (a nonproducer line of MC29-transformed quail embryo fibroblasts) and nonproducer cells derived from a liver tumor of MC20-infected quail. This is in contrast to the distribution of gag-related helper virus proteins lacking myc, which are found only in nonnuclear fractions of superinfected Q8 cells. The purity of unlabeled nuclei was assessed by electron microscopy and enzyme assays, revealing little contaminating material from other subcellular fractions. Immunofluorescence experiments using monospecific anti-gag serum showed specific, intense immunofluorescence in the nuclei of fixed Q8 cells. In contrast, the majority of P75gag-erb, a candidate transforming protein produced by avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV), is absent from the nuclei of nonproducer AEV-transformed chick embryo fibroblasts. The nuclear association of the MC29 transforming protein may be related to some of the unique properties of MC29-transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2035680172,"An 18 kb region adjacent to and surrounding the genes for nitrogenase (nif) was cloned from the genome of the symbiotic nitrogen-fixing species Rhizobium meliloti. A total of 31 Tn5 insertions in the nif region were constructed and assayed for their effect on symbiotic nitrogen fixation (Fix phenotype). Fix− insertions were found in two clusters, one 6.3 kb and a second at least 5.0 kb, separated by a 1.6 kb region not containing essential symbiotic genes. The locations of at least three transcription units containing Fix genes were deduced from complementation analysis between genomic nif::Tn5 insertions and nif::Tn5 insertions on mobilizable cloning vectors. The locations of R. meliloti genes nifH, nifD and nifK, which code for the single subunit of the nitrogenase Fe protein and for the two subunits of the nitrogenase MoFe protein respectively, were determined by DNA hybridization to cloned Klebsiella pneumoniae nif genes and by comparison of partial R. meliloti DNA sequences with K. pneumoniae nif gene sequences. R. meliloti nifH, D and K are located in the 6.3 kb Fix−::Tn5 cluster and are transcribed in the order nifH, nifD, nifK, which is the same order as in K. pneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W1497356015,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors extracted with Triton X-100 from human skin fibroblasts and A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells rapidly lose EGF-binding activity precipitable with polyethylene glycol. The presence of concanavalin A which can cross-link and, thereby, aggregate the receptors, allowed quantitative recovery of the lost EGF-binding activity. Scatchard analysis of EGF binding of Triton X-100-solubilized receptors showed that A431 cells and skin fibroblasts possess approximately 1.5 X 10(6) and 7 X 10(4) EGF-binding sites/cell, respectively, which exhibit similar affinities for the ligand. The heavy isotope density-shift method was employed to determine whether differences in rates of receptor synthesis or decay account for the large difference in number of receptors/cell between the two cell types. After shifting cells to medium containing heavy (15N, 13C, and 2H) amino acids, light and heavy receptors, solubilized from total cellular membranes, were resolved by isopycnic banding on density gradients and then quantitated. It was demonstrated that A431 cells synthesize EGF receptors at a rate 12 times faster than skin fibroblasts and that the half-life for receptor decay of A431 cells is somewhat longer (t1/2 = 16 h) than that (t1/2 = 9 h) of fibroblasts. Down-regulation of cell surface and total cellular EGF-binding capacity in A431 cells occurs with a t1/2 of 2-3 h and results in a 70-83% decrease in receptor level in 12 h. Scatchard analysis revealed that these changes in EGF binding were due to an alteration of receptor number and not EGF-binding affinity. Rates of EGF receptor synthesis and inactivation/decay were determined by the heavy isotope density-shift method. No change in the rate of receptor synthesis occurred as a consequence of EGF receptor down-regulation. Down-regulation, however, caused a decrease in receptor half-life from 16 to 4.5 h. These results indicate that EGF-dependent regulation of EGF receptor level in A431 cells involves an alteration of the rate of receptor inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1558985378,"Highly purified human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was iodinated with 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent to a specific activity of 34 microCi/micrograms of protein. After iodination, molecular sieve chromatography was used to isolate fractions containing IFN-gamma at approximately 80-90% radioactive purity. This preparation of 125I-IFN-gamma bound specifically to high affinity binding sites on human GM-258 fibroblasts. Scatchard analysis of binding data revealed the presence of 2400 binding sites/cell, each binding with an apparent Kd of 1.5 X 10(-10) M. Binding was competitively inhibited in the presence of unlabeled IFN-gamma and, to a lesser degree, by IFN-beta, but not by IFN-alpha. Neutralizing antibodies specific for IFN-gamma efficiently inhibited the specific binding of 125I-IFN-gamma to cells. We conclude that the specific high affinity binding site is the receptor for IFN-gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1546998836,"The possible involvement of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-derived hydroxyl radical (.OH) in lignin degradation ([14C]lignin leads to 14CO2) by Phanerochaete chrysosporium was investigated. When P. chrysosporium was grown in low nitrogen medium (2.4 mM N), an increase in the specific activity for H2O2 production in cell extracts was observed to coincide with the appearance of ligninolytic activity and both activities appeared after the culture entered stationary phase. The production of .OH in ligninolytic cultures of P. chrysosporium was demonstrated by alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyric acid-dependent formation of ethylene. Hydrogen peroxide-dependent .OH formation was also shown in cell extracts of ligninolytic cultures. The radical species was demonstrated to be .OH by the .OH-dependent hydroxylation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid to form protocatechuic acid and by using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide and detecting the production of the nitroxide radical of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide by EPR. These reactions were inhibited by .OH-scavenging agents and were stimulated when azide was added to inhibit endogenous catalase. Lignin degradation by P. chrysosporium was markedly suppressed in the presence of the .OH-scavenging agents mannitol, benzoate, and the nonspecific radical scavenging agent butylated hydroxytoluene. The above results indicate that .OH derived from H2O2 is involved in lignin biodegradation by P. chrysosporium."
https://openalex.org/W1581865960,"Cytochrome P-450 is destroyed during catalytic oxidation of several 4-substituted 3,5-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine substrates. A qualitative correlation has been found between the ability to destroy cytochrome P-450 and the stability of the 4-substituent as a radical. Destruction of the enzyme by the 4-ethyl (DDEP), 4-propyl, and 4-isobutyl analogues is due to transfer of the 4-alkyl group from the substrate to a nitrogen of the prosthetic heme, a process which gives rise to isolable N-alkylprotoporphyrin IX derivatives. Little enzyme destruction is observed when the 4-alkyl group is of low radical stability (methyl, phenyl) and good destruction, but no isolable heme adducts when the 4-substituent is of very high radical stability (isopropyl, benzyl). Spin-trapping studies have established that the 4-ethyl group in DDEP is lost as a radical as a result of oxidation by cytochrome P-450. Of three commonly used spin traps, only alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide) N-tert-butylnitrone was found suitable for such studies. The other spin traps, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide and alpha-phenyl N-tert-butylnitrone, were found to be ineffective, the latter because it strongly inhibits cytochrome P-450. Hydrogen peroxide formed in situ can support a part of the cytochrome P-450-catalyzed ethyl radical formation and DDEP-dependent self-inactivation. The results provide persuasive evidence that oxidation of the nitrogen in DDEP by cytochrome P-450 proceeds in one-electron steps. Cytochrome P-450 may thus function, at least with certain substrates, as a one-electron oxidant."
https://openalex.org/W2031365238,"We identified, in cells transformed by Moloney murine sarcoma virus (M-MuSV clone 124), a protein encoded by the M-MuSV transforming gene, v-mos. An antiserum against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of a protein predicted from the v-mos nucleotide sequence specifically recognizes a protein doublet of approximately 37,000 daltons from 35S-methionine-labeled M-MuSV 124-transformed producer cells. By peptide mapping, this protein is almost identical to the 37 kd in vitro translation product from the M-MuSV v-mos gene. Immunoprecipitates from 32P-labeled cells contain a single v-mos-specific phosphoprotein, which has at least six sites of phosphorylation containing phosphoserine. Pulse-chase experiments show that the lower band in the 35S-methionine-labeled doublet is the primary translation product, which is modified, probably by phosphorylation, to yield the upper band. A similar mos protein is immunoprecipitated from HT1-MuSV-transformed cells, but not from uninfected NIH/3T3 cells. These mos proteins are present at very low levels in transformed cell lines. Cells acutely infected with M-MuSV 124, however, transiently contain much higher levels of the mos protein. These high levels coincide with extensive cell mortality."

On days 7 and 35, they were given intramuscular injections of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788. Mild and intermediate withdrawal signs, including retching and vomiting, were observed after 7 days of diazepam, and more frequent and intense withdrawal signs, including tremor and convulsion, occurred after 35 days of diazepam. With the termination of the diazepam injections after 45 days, a mild to intermediate withdrawal syndrome was observed over the next 15-day period."
https://openalex.org/W2065613169,"The human IgE gene encodes a polypeptide chain that is involved in allergic reactions and in the immune response to parasitic disease in man. We have cloned three chromosomal regions corresponding to this sequence and find that two of them derive from curiously duplicated gene segments that also encode IgA constant-region genes. One of the IgE sequences corresponds to the active gene, and its structure defines a complete amino acid sequence of the human IgE constant region. The other cloned segment is a pseudogene from which the first two IgE coding domains have been deleted and replaced by a switch-like sequence that also occurs close to the normal IgE gene. The third IgE segment remains unlinked to the other heavy-chain genes. Evidently, the epsilon-alpha locus has been the site of several complicated genetic rearrangements during recent evolutionary time."
https://openalex.org/W2071223149,"We have characterized the structure and flanking region of genes representing two, coordinately expressed, soybean seed protein gene families. One family directs the synthesis of the major storage protein glycinin; the other encodes a 15.5 kd poly-peptide of unknown function. DNA blot hybridization experiments showed approximately three, non-allelic genes in the glycinin family and two in the 15 kd protein family, and showed that these families are not selectively amplified or rearranged during embryogeny. R-loop and S1 nuclease mapping studies demonstrated no detectable introns in the 15 kd protein genes but at least one and possibly two in the glycinin genes. No interfamily clustering of these genes occurs within a 10–15 kb chromosomal domain. Nor are they contiguous to other genes expressed at moderate levels during embryogenesis. Each of them, however, is contiguous to a gene expressed at another developmental period in the leaf. These leaf genes encode rare class messages which constitute only 1 × 10−5% of the leaf mRNA, or about one molecule per cell. R-loop analysis of two leaf genes showed that one contains no detectable introns while the other possesses at least three. DNA gel blot studies showed that only one of the seed protein genomic clones contains an interspersed repetitive DNA element. Pairwise cross-hybridization studies did not detect any flanking sequences shared by the 15 kd protein, glycinin and leaf genes."

https://openalex.org/W1589594026,"The transforming protein coded for by the onc gene (v-rasHa) of Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MuSV) is the 21,000-dalton protein (p21) which is the immediate agent responsible for the virus-induced malignant transformation of normal cells. The p21 proteins of Ha-MuSV and the closely related Kirsten murine sarcoma virus are heavily phosphorylated in vivo. In the partially purified Ha-MuSV p21, the protein shows a guanine nucleotide-binding activity and, in addition, a very unique autophosphorylating activity at a threonine residue using as phosphoryl donor GTP but not ATP. In the present study, we compared the tryptic peptide maps of the Ha-MuSV p21 phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro. The results show that the major phosphorylation site is identical. Since the GTP-specific phosphorylation is very unique and distinct from all other known protein kinases, the present observation suggests that the in vitro enzymatic activity is responsible for the p21 phosphorylation in vivo. We have analyzed the amino acid sequence surrounding the major phosphorylation site of the Ha-MuSV p21 by automated Edman degradations of the tryptic phosphopeptides. Threonine residue 59 from the initiator methionine residue 1 of the p21 protein is the phosphorylated amino acid residue, and the surrounding amino acid sequence is NH2...-Thr-Cys-Leu-Leu-Asp-Ile-Leu-Asp-Thr-Thr(P)-Gly-Gln-Glu-Glu-Tyr-...COOH. The p21 proteins of both the Ha-MuSV and the closely related Kirsten murine sarcoma virus share the same phosphopeptide. The amino acid sequence of the phosphorylation site is distinct from all other known protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1554960389,"The modulation of ovarian steroidogenesis by epidermal growth factor (EGF) was investigated in cultured rat granulosa cells. Granulosa cells, obtained from ovaries of immature, hypophysectomized, estrogen-treated rats, were incubated for 2 days with EGF, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or EGF plus FSH. Treatment with EGF did not affect estrogen production, but stimulated progestin (i.e. progesterone and 20 alpha-hydroxy-pregn-4-en-3-one) production in a dose-dependent manner. Stimulation of progestin production by EGF appears to be the result of an increase in pregnenolone biosynthesis as well as increases in the activities of 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase. Treatment with FSH increased both estrogen and progestin production by cultured granulosa cells. When cells were treated concomitantly with EGF, FSH-stimulated estrogen production was inhibited, while progestin production was further enhanced. The EGF enhancement of FSH-stimulated progestin production appears to be the result of synergistic increases in pregnenolone biosynthesis and 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, resulting in substantial increases in 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one but not progesterone production. The effects of EGF were shown to be time-dependent. The concept of a direct action of EGF on rat granulosa cells is reinforced by the demonstration of high affinity (Kd approximately 3 X 10(-10) M), low capacity (approximately 5,000 sites/cell) EGF binding sites in these cells. Thus, EGF interacts with specific granulosa cell receptors to stimulate progestin but to inhibit estrogen biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2091830377,"Woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), like the related hepatitis B virus, induces in its natural host hepatocellular carcinomas that contain integrated viral sequences. As a first step in determining whether and how the integrated sequences contribute to formation of the tumors in which they are found, we have cloned two such integrations of WHV and have determined their structure by restriction mapping and heteroduplex electron microscopy. The identity of the cloned sequences was confirmed by comparison of restriction sites in the clones with those located by Southern blot analysis of tumor DNA. Viral sequences in both integrations are extensively rearranged, and in neither were all parts of the viral genome represented. In this respect, the behavior of WHV in vivo is similar to that of other DNA tumor viruses that have been studied in vitro. We discuss the implications of these results in relation to possible mechanisms for tumor induction by WHV."
https://openalex.org/W2141356573,"We obtained strains of yeast with large segments of 2μ plasmid DNA integrated at several chromosomal locations by selecting genetically for recombination between a chromosomal sequence carried on a 2μ-circle-containing hybrid plasmid and a homologous sequence on the chromosome. In all diploids examined, the presence of 2μ circle sequences causes a marked instability of the chromosome into which the 2μ DNA is inserted. Although in some cases the loss of genetic markers is due to physical loss of the entire chromosome, in most cases the loss of markers appears to be due to a mitotic homozygotization of markers: the allelic information from the homologous chromosome replaces the information distal to the integrated 2μ DNA. The instability caused by integrated 2μ DNA sequences requires the activity of the specialized site-specific recombination system encoded by the 2μ plasmid. We propose that the presence of integrated 2μ DNA allows efficient integration of additional copies of the intact 2μ plasmid by the action of the plasmid-coded special recombination system. Unequal sister-strand exchanges within the inverted repetition would result in the formation of dicentric chromosomes whose breakage during mitosis might begin a cycle analogous to the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle described many years ago in maize."

https://openalex.org/W1971547958,"The 5'-terminal sequence of the kappa light-chain gene expressed in MPC11 plasmacytoma cells was definitively determined by analysis of both the kappa mRNA and the gene from which it is transcribed. The distance between the cap site and the translation initiation codon is only 3 nucleotides, and in a minor variant only 2 nucleotides, considerably less than that found in other species of nucleus-derived mRNA. S1 nuclease protection experiments with MPC11 nuclear RNA indicate that the cap sites are coincident with the transcriptional start sites, suggesting that the 5'-terminal heterogeneity is caused by imprecision in transcriptional initiation. A comparison of the 5'-terminal structure of the MPC11 V kappa gene with that of several other V genes indicates that the length of the first exon, which is composed of the 5' untranslated region which is composed of the 5' untranslated region and a sequence encoding most of the signal peptide, is highly conserved. Within this set of examples, the 5' untranslated region varies from 3 to 33 nucleotides, and the signal-peptide-coding block from 46 to 76 nucleotides. This analysis has also provided insight into the genetic origins for two anomalous properties of the MPC11 light chain."

https://openalex.org/W1553158588,"The gelatinolytic activity of human skin fibroblast collagenase was examined on denatured collagen types I-V. All denatured substrates were cleaved, including types IV and V, which are resistant to collagenase in native form. Interestingly, the earliest major cleavage in denatured collagen types I-III occurred at a 3/4-1/4 locus, resulting in products electrophoretically identical with TCA and TCB fragments of mammalian collagenase action on these native collagens. However, in the denatured substrates, multiple additional proteolytic cleavages followed. The propensity for cleavage at a 3/4-1/4 site in denatured collagen, where sequence is the major specifier of enzymatic action, would seem to indicate that the most favorable amino acid sequence of gamma chains for catalysis is located in this region. The peptide bond specificity of human fibroblast collagenase on gelatin was examined by amino acid sequencing of extensively cleaved denatured type I collagen. Analysis of the NH2-terminal amino acid residues from the resultant gelatin peptides showed sequences of -H2N-Ile-Y-Gly and H2N-Leu-Y-Gly only (where Y indicates that any amino acid can be found in that position), indicating that Gly-Ile and Gly-Leu bonds are the only sites of collagenase cleavage in this substrate. Whereas the gamma1 chains of denatured collagen types I-III were cleaved at similar rates, fibroblast collagenase was a much better gamma2-gelatinase than gamm1-gelatinase on denatured type 1 collagen. This preference for the cleavage of gamma2(I) was the result of both a higher kcat (750 versus 230 h-1) and lower Km (3.7 versus 7.0 microM) than for a gamma1(1), resulting in an overall selectivity (kcat/Km) of greater than 6-fold. Compared to such kinetic parameters on native collagen, these values indicate that gelatinolysis is somewhat slower than collagenolysis."

The intact human and viral genes were found in DNA of one of the animals and, in the other, at least part of the human globin gene was present. The latter individual transmitted these sequences to its progeny in a Mendelian ration. Thus, human DNA may be incorporated into the germ line of mice for in vivo studies of regulation of gene expression in development, genetic diseases, and malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W1546644463,"The purification of polynucleotide kinase from Escherichia coli infected by two different mutants in the T4 polynucleotide kinase (pseT) gene is described. The pseT 1 enzyme has virtually no 3' specific phosphatase activity and normal polynucleotide kinase activity. The pseT 47 enzyme has very little phosphatase activity and no kinase activity. However, enzyme isolated from a pseT 1, pseT 47 mixed infection appears to contain heterodimers with considerably more phosphatase activity. Thus, the pseT 47 mutation partially inactivates the phosphatase and totally inactivates the kinase. A study of the action of polynucleotide kinase on plasmid DNAs nicked to give a 3'-phosphate and a 5'-hydroxyl indicates that although the enzyme can catalyze both the removal of the 3'-phosphate and the insertion of a 5'-phosphate, there is no evidence for a concerted reaction involving both activities on the same polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1513669884,We have isolated a lambda-transducing phage carrying the gene (glnS) for Escherichia coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase. The location of the glnS gene within the 13.5-kilobase E. coli DNA transducing fragment was determined by genetic means. The glnS gene was recloned into plasmid pBR322 and its nucleotide sequence was established. The DNA sequence translates to a protein of 550 amino acids.
https://openalex.org/W1988202882,"We examined the affinities of SV40 large T antigen for unique viral DNA sequences by binding SV40 Bst NI DNA fragments in extracts of infected or transformed cells, and then immunoprecipitating the T antigen-DNA complex. The G fragment, which spans the viral origin of replication (ori) was quantitatively bound to T antigen. A T-antigen-specific monoclonal antibody (McI 7), which recognized only 5%-10% of the T antigen from infected or transformed cells, immunoprecipitated the majority of the ori-binding activity. This suggests that only a minor subclass of wild-type T antigen is active in binding to the origin. C6 cells contain a replication-defective mutant T antigen that when tested in the DNA-binding immunoassay, showed no affinity for the ori fragment. McI 7 not only failed to immunoprecipitate ori binding in C6 cells, but also did not detect any labeled C6 T antigen whatever. Thus McI 7 recognizes an immunologically distinct subset of wild-type 7 antigen that comprises the origin-binding form of the viral protein, which is absent in the C6 T antigen population. McI 122, which recognizes a 53 kilodalton host protein that complexes with T antigen, immunoprecipitated ori-binding activity from extracts of infected or transformed cells, but not from C6 cells. Thus wild-type T antigen can bind ori sequences even when complexed to the host protein. These data suggest that T antigen consists of different subpopulations with different functions."

Treatment with the adenosime receptor agonists N6-cyclohexyladenosine and L-phenylisopropyladenosine blocked the discriminative properties of phencyclidine. These results suggest that adenosine receptor agonists might be useful in treating phencyclidine-induced psychosis."

The activity of several key steroidogenic enzymes was measured following treatment with 5 IU of hCG/day for 6 days. A5-3/3-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-isomerase activity and 17a-hydroxylase activity both increased approximately 2-fold in all three Leydig cell populations following hCG treatment, while Cl7-Cz0 lyase activity increased 4.4-fold in population IA, 2.7-fold in population IB, and 1.8-fold in popdation 11. The 17-ketosteroid reductase activity did not change, except in population I1 in which it decreased by 63%. 5a-Reductase activity similarly did not change except in population IA in which it decreased by 77%. There were no changes in apparent K,,, values following injection of 5 IU of hCG/day with the exception of a 2.6fold increase in the apparent K,,, of 17a-hydroxylase in population IA (0.017 to 0.045 p~). Seventy-two hours after a single injection of 150 pg of luteinizing hormone, 50 IU of hCG, or 100 IU of hCG, there were marked decreases in the activities of 17a-hydroxylase and CI.I-C~O lyase in all three Leydig cell populations.

https://openalex.org/W1481257580,"Because of the potential importance of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases in the regulation of airway smooth muscle tone, we have examined some of the characteristics of these enzymes in the soluble fraction of canine trachealis homogenates. In the absence of added cAMP, the heat-stable cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) abolished only a half of the 32P incorporation into mixed histones. The remaining activity appeared to be contributed by a cyclic nucleotide-independent enzyme. Phosphotransferase activity was enhanced 5-fold by 5 microM cAMP but only 70% of the cAMP-stimulated activity could be inhibited by PKI. The sensitivity of the cyclic nucleotide-dependent, PKI-resistant enzyme to cAMP, cGMP, and Mg2+ indicated that it was cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Because of the large amount of cyclic nucleotide-independent activity, and the ability of cAMP to activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase, the traditional -cAMP/+cAMP ratio did not provide an accurate assessment of the in vivo activation state of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. However, a modified assay was developed which allowed the precise measurement of cAMP-dependent, cGMP-dependent, and cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase activities. Using this new method, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity ratio of 0.239 in untreated trachealis strips was increased to 0.355 and 0.386 by prior exposure of the intact tissue to the smooth muscle relaxants isoproterenol and prostaglandin E2, respectively. The results of this study are consistent with the proposed role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the regulation of smooth muscle contractile function."

https://openalex.org/W1595074684,"The transport model of glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) was recently challenged by a report that detergent treatment had no effect on the presteady state kinetics of glucose-6-P hydrolysis catalyzed at 0 degree C by the enzyme in liver microsomes previously frozen in 0.25 M mannitol (Zakim, D., and Edmondson, D. E. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 1145-1148). The lack of response to detergent is shown to be the expected consequence of the conditions used in the presteady state measurements. First, when the assay temperature was reduced from 30 to 0 degree C the depression in the glucose-6-P phosphohydrolase activity of intact microsomes (i.e. the system) was much greater than that of fully disrupted microsomes (i.e. enzyme). This indicates that temperature influences transport much more than hydrolysis of glucose-6-P. As a result, the contribution of a small fraction of enzyme associated with disrupted structures is markedly exaggerated, so it becomes the predominant hydrolytic activity before detergent treatment. Second, freezing microsomes in 0.25 M mannitol caused such extensive disruption that all of the activity manifest at 0 degree C could be attributed to enzyme in disrupted structures. The present findings underscore the importance of assessing the state of intactness of untreated microsomes and quantifying the contribution of the disrupted component in kinetic analyses of the glucose-6-phosphatase system. The proposition that the detergent-induced changes in the kinetic properties of glucose 6-phosphatase represent removal of constraints imposed on the enzyme by the membrane environment rather than increased access of enzyme to substrate is critically analyzed."

Evidence that there is a physical linkage between a transposable element and its target DNA sequence during transposition comes from studies on bacteriophage Mu DNA transposition in which plasmids containing Mu DNA have been shown to attach to host DNA. We report the isolation of key structures, seen after induction of Mu DNA replication, after cloning lac operator into Mu DNA and using the lac repressor-operator interaction to trap Mu DNA on nitrocellulose filters. We have localized Mu sequences within these structures in the electron microscope by visualizing the lac operator-repressor interaction after binding with ferritin-conjugated antibody. This analysis shows that key structures contain replicating Mu DNA linked to non-Mu DNA and that replication can begin at either end of Mu."

A small subpopulation of untreated factor molecules is fully active, however. The factor is a protein that is characterized by considerable heat resistance and sensitivity to reducing agents. It does not seem to require sugar residues or lipid for its activity. Activation occurs both at alkaline and acidic pH. Inactive and activated factor differ in their sensitivity to trypsin and in the degree of sensitivity to reducing agents. A change of conformation within the molecule seems to be the biochemical basis for the activation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1525588707,"Intact microsomes from groups of fed, fasted, glucocorticoid-treated (triamcinolone) and diabetic (alloxan) rats were reacted with 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic (DIDS), a specific inhibitor of microsomal glucose-6-P translocase. The concentrations that inhibit by 50% were 41 +/- 2, 31 +/- 1, 39 +/- 4, and 18 +/- 1 microM (mean +/- S.E.; n = 3); (order as above). The maximal levels of inhibition of the translocase by DIDS were 66 +/- 2, 79 +/- 2, 63 +/- 1, and 88 +/- 1%, respectively. The differences in the values for the different groups of animals are statistically significant, except for comparisons between fed and triamcinolone-treated animals. Microsomes from the same groups of animals were treated with the tritiated reduced derivative of DIDS, [3H]H2DIDS, which labels a 54,000-dalton polypeptide, previously implicated as a component of the glucose-6-P translocase. The mean values (+/- S.E.) of [3H]H2DIDS bound to the polypeptide under saturating conditions were 100 +/- 6, 120 +/- 9, 62 +/- 7, and 101 +/- 15 pmol/mg of microsomal protein, respectively. The amount bound in microsomes from triamcinolone-treated rats is significantly lower from the values for the other three physiological states, which do not differ significantly from each other. The presence of glucose-6-P, but not mannose-6-P, during the [3H]H2DIDS reaction significantly stimulates the labeling of the 54,000-dalton polypeptide in microsomes from all the classes of animals above, except the diabetic animals. These results indicate that DIDS and [3H]H2DIDS are probes sensitive enough to discern differences in the translocase due to physiological regulation. On the basis of the labeling studies with [3H]H2DIDS, the increase in translocase activity observed in microsomes from fasted, triamcinolone-treated, and diabetic rats cannot be ascribed to increased numbers of translocase molecules, but rather to increased functional activity of the translocase protein."
https://openalex.org/W1527802277,"We have used two chemical modification reagents and three proteases to study the relationship between the two activities of T4 polynucleotide kinase. In each case, conditions were found where one of the two activities of the enzyme could be eliminated without greatly reducing the other. Taken together, these data indicate that the two activities are catalyzed by amino acid residues located in separate active sites on the polypeptide chain. Specific exopeptidase digestion indicates that the kinase activity lies in the NH2-terminal and the phosphatase in the COOH-terminal portion of the polypeptide chain. Partial trypsin digestion produces a 29,000-dalton fragment with no kinase activity and nearly normal 3'-phosphatase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1595207706,"Abstract Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination was used to study the arrangement of the component peptides of succinate-cytochrome c reductase with respect to the aqueous phases on each side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Mitochondria depleted of their outer membrane and inside-out vesicles purified from submitochondrial particles by the lectin-affinity procedure (D'Souza, M. P., and Lindsay, J. G. (1981) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 640, 463-472) were iodinated using immobilized preparations of lactoperoxidase. The labeled membranes were solubilized in detergent and the succinate-cytochrome c reductase was purified by immunoprecipitation with specific IgG. Analysis of the radioiodine distribution after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and comparison with peptide stain patterns show that bands 2 (64 kilodaltons), 6 (30 kilodaltons), 9 (15 kilodaltons), and 11 (less than 10 kilodaltons) are labeled from the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. Bands 1 (72 kilodaltons), 4 (48 kilodaltons), and 8 (20 kilodaltons) appear to be labeled on the matrix side of the membrane, while bands 3 (52 kilodaltons), 5 (35 kilodaltons), 7 (25 kilodaltons), and 10 (11 kilodaltons) are labeled from both sides of the membrane. Tentative identification of the labeled bands suggests that band 1 is the large subunit of succinate dehydrogenase. Bands 3 and 4 represent proteins which have been referred to as core proteins I and II. Bands 5 and 6 are the proteins associated with cytochromes b and c1, respectively; band 7 is the Rieske iron-sulfur protein."
https://openalex.org/W1488465504,"Mg-substituted horseradish peroxidases were oxidized by K2IrCl6 or K3Fe(CN)6 to their porphyrin radical form and the 1:1 stoichiometric relationship was confirmed by spectrophotometric, fluorophotometric, and ESR titration methods. The values of E'0 for oxidations of Mg peroxidases A and C were both 0.63 V at pH 6 and depended on pH in the same way as postulated for the Compound I/Compound II couples of the corresponding enzymes. Unlike Zn peroxidase C, Mg peroxidase C was not directly oxidized by H2O2. The oxidation was catalyzed by the native peroxidase. Mg peroxidase C was photooxidized to the radical form faster than Zn peroxidase C, but its oxidation was accomplished by irreversible changes in the porphyrin in the early stage of reaction. The rate of reduction of the oxidized Mg peroxidases in the presence of various electron donors was measured at varying pH values and compared with the rate of Compound I reduction. A role of porphyrin as a site of electron transfer in the peroxidase catalysis was suggested."

The final purification procedure involved digestion of isolated nuclei with Eco RI restriction endonuclease, solubilization of a fraction of the chromatin by lysis of the nuclei at low ionic strength, and chromatography of the soluble chromatin fragments on malachite green DNA affinity resin. Digestion of chromatin within steer kidney and thymus nuclei by Eco RI reached limits at which 22% and 37%, respectively, of the potential sites for the enzyme in the 1.715 satellite chromatin were cleaved. A test of the 1.715 g ml-1 satellite DNA extracted from digested thymus nuclei showed it was not significantly nicked at Eco RI sites. Fractionation of soluble chromatin fragments produced by Eco RI digestion on the basis of size using either sucrose gradient centrifugation or chromatin gel electrophoresis yielded 1.715 satellite chromatin of 60-80% purity. However, chromatography of the soluble chromatin fragments on columns of malachite green resin gave 1.715 satellite chromatin of higher purity and in greater amounts than could be obtained with the sucrose gradients or chromatin gels. Using malachite green resin, hundreds of micrograms of 1;715 satellite chromatin could be obtained with a purity that was usually at least 95% as determined by melting of the extracted DNA."
