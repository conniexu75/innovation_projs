https://openalex.org/W2751657823,"Monkeys, like humans, normally have face domains in inferotemporal cortex; however, monkeys raised without exposure to faces do not develop face patches. Normally reared monkeys, like humans, preferentially look at faces, but face-deprived monkeys do not. These results highlight the importance of early experience for normal sensory and cognitive development. Here we report that monkeys raised without exposure to faces did not develop face domains, but did develop domains for other categories and did show normal retinotopic organization, indicating that early face deprivation leads to a highly selective cortical processing deficit. Therefore, experience must be necessary for the formation (or maintenance) of face domains. Gaze tracking revealed that control monkeys looked preferentially at faces, even at ages prior to the emergence of face domains, but face-deprived monkeys did not, indicating that face looking is not innate. A retinotopic organization is present throughout the visual system at birth, so selective early viewing behavior could bias category-specific visual responses toward particular retinotopic representations, thereby leading to domain formation in stereotyped locations in inferotemporal cortex, without requiring category-specific templates or biases. Thus, we propose that environmental importance influences viewing behavior, viewing behavior drives neuronal activity, and neuronal activity sculpts domain formation."
https://openalex.org/W2752072263,"Actin filaments polymerizing against membranes power endocytosis, vesicular traffic, and cell motility. In vitro reconstitution studies suggest that the structure and the dynamics of actin networks respond to mechanical forces. We demonstrate that lamellipodial actin of migrating cells responds to mechanical load when membrane tension is modulated. In a steady state, migrating cell filaments assume the canonical dendritic geometry, defined by Arp2/3-generated 70° branch points. Increased tension triggers a dense network with a broadened range of angles, whereas decreased tension causes a shift to a sparse configuration dominated by filaments growing perpendicularly to the plasma membrane. We show that these responses emerge from the geometry of branched actin: when load per filament decreases, elongation speed increases and perpendicular filaments gradually outcompete others because they polymerize the shortest distance to the membrane, where they are protected from capping. This network-intrinsic geometrical adaptation mechanism tunes protrusive force in response to mechanical load."
https://openalex.org/W2752703006,"Astrocytes produce and supply metabolic substrates to neurons through gap junction-mediated astroglial networks. However, the role of astroglial metabolic networks in behavior is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that perturbation of astroglial networks impairs the sleep-wake cycle. Using a conditional Cre-Lox system in mice, we show that knockout of the gap junction subunit connexin 43 in astrocytes throughout the brain causes excessive sleepiness and fragmented wakefulness during the nocturnal active phase. This astrocyte-specific genetic manipulation silenced the wake-promoting orexin neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) by impairing glucose and lactate trafficking through astrocytic networks. This global wakefulness instability was mimicked with viral delivery of Cre recombinase to astrocytes in the LHA and rescued by in vivo injections of lactate. Our findings propose a novel regulatory mechanism critical for maintaining normal daily cycle of wakefulness and involving astrocyte-neuron metabolic interactions."

Neurotransmission across synapses relies on the precisely timed exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at presynaptic active zone (AZ) membranes (Südhof, 2012Südhof T.C. The presynaptic active zone.Neuron. 2012; 75: 11-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Action potentials (APs) activate presynaptic voltage-gated Ca2+ channels leading to fast and local elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations that are sensed by the SV release machinery to induce SV fusion. Ca2+ sensing relies on the vesicular protein synaptotagmin, while the formation of SNARE complexes, composed of the vesicular protein synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2 and the plasma membrane (PM) proteins Syntaxin-1A (Syx-1A) and SNAP25, provide energy necessary for fusion (Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012Jahn R. Fasshauer D. Molecular machines governing exocytosis of synaptic vesicles.Nature. 2012; 490: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Before SV fusion can be evoked by APs, a number of well-coordinated reactions take place. Docking, the physical SV attachment to the PM, and priming, the maturation into a fusion competent state, require the concerted action of the SNAREs, Unc13, and Unc18 (Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012Jahn R.

The synaptic vesicle release machinery.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2015; 44: 339-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Pioneering analyses of the statistical features of neurotransmitter (NT) release established that exocytosis occurs from few highly specialized release sites (McLachlan, 1978McLachlan E.M.

Theoretical calculations further suggested that a well-defined placement of SV release sites relative to Ca2+ channels is required for effective transmission and proper short-term plasticity (Keller et al., 2015Keller D.

To address the physiological relevance of release site placement experimentally, it would be useful to alter release site localization selectively, but the relevant release site generating molecule is yet unknown. AZ scaffolding proteins like RIM, Bruchpilot (BRP)/ELKS, and Rim-binding protein (RBP) regulate SV docking and release site numbers and positions (Acuna et al., 2015Acuna C. Liu X. Gonzalez A.

But as none of these proteins have an established direct function in SV fusion, the question arises which downstream effector establishes release sites at AZ scaffolds. Release sites are locations where SVs dock and prime for release; thus, release site defining molecules are expected to function in these reactions. Their localization should predict SV docking sites, and because estimated Ca2+ channel/release site distances are smaller than typical AZ dimensions they should localize within AZs with nanometer precision (Eggermann et al., 2011Eggermann E. Bucurenciu I. Goswami S.P. Jonas P. Nanodomain coupling between Ca2+ channels and sensors of exocytosis at fast mammalian synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 13: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because SV fusion at release sites occurs in an all or none fashion, synaptic transmission obeys binomial statistics and fluctuation analyses can be used to estimate the number of release sites (Clements and Silver, 2000Clements J.D.

Changes in the statistics of transmitter release during facilitation.J. Physiol. 1973; 229: 787-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Because this depends on the repetitive re-use of a fixed number of release sites (Neher, 2010Neher E. What is rate-limiting during sustained synaptic activity: vesicle supply or the availability of release sites.Front. Synaptic Neurosci. 2010; 2: 144Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), molecules generating these sites are expected to show high positional stability. Moreover, synaptic activity is expected to scale with the number of release sites. Therefore, a positive relation of the single AZ activity status on the limiting molecules generating release sites is expected. Ultimately, release site generating molecules will be revealed by mutation of candidate proteins that cause changes in release site number, position, or functionality. A dependence of synaptic transmission on the AZ-specific localization was suggested for the SV docking and priming factor Unc13, making it a prime candidate (Böhme et al., 2016Böhme M.A. Beis C. Reddy-Alla S. Reynolds E. Mampell M.M. Grasskamp A.T. Lützkendorf J. Bergeron D.D. Driller J.H.

Position of UNC-13 in the active zone regulates synaptic vesicle release probability and release kinetics.eLife. 2013; 2: e01180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using super-resolution (stimulated emission depletion [STED]) microscopy and intravital live imaging of glutamatergic Drosophila neuromuscular synapses, we found that Unc13A stably localized to AZs where it displayed turnover times of several hours. In contrast, the other essential SV docking and priming proteins Syx-1A and Unc18 were broadly distributed and exchanged within minutes. Local Unc13A levels predicted spontaneous and AP-evoked synaptic transmission at single AZs, and, while the same was true for local BRP levels, this scaffold dependence was weakened upon Unc13A knockdown, arguing that AZ scaffolds indirectly regulate activity and release site numbers by recruiting Unc13s. An N-terminal Unc13A fragment stably anchored in the same AZ-subregions as the full-length protein. Its overexpression in a wild-type background partially displaced endogenous Unc13A and reduced the number of release sites, in line with blocking interaction sites required to generate release sites at the AZ scaffold. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal sequence resulted in promiscuous and transient localization of the remaining protein, similar to Unc18 and Syx-1A. Synaptic transmission operating via this C-terminal fragment displayed increased spontaneous but decreased AP-evoked activity. Furthermore, although the number of release sites was dramatically increased, their release probability was so low that even extreme Ca2+ influx only activated few of them. Ultra-structural analysis of AZs expressing the C-terminal fragment revealed increased but unspecific SV docking. An exclusion zone of docked SVs close to the AZ center (where Ca2+ channels reside), which was clearly established in control cells, was lost. Responses to high-frequency trains showed extreme facilitation and delayed release building up during the train, indicative of release sites atypically distant from Ca2+ channels, as effects were reverted by the Ca2+ buffer EGTA. Thus, the Unc13A N- and C-terminal portions function in stable AZ positioning (via AZ scaffold interactions) and release site generation at well-defined sub-AZ positions to ensure temporal fidelity and adequate short-term plasticity of synaptic transmission. SV release sites are defined locations where SVs dock and prime for release. To identify molecules defining these sites, we therefore focused on the essential docking and priming factors Syx-1A, Unc18 (flybase: Rop), and Unc13A, the Unc13 isoform dominating evoked SV release at Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses (flybase: unc-13) (Böhme et al., 2016Böhme M.A. Beis C.

First, we analyzed which of these were kept within a narrow sub-AZ distribution range, as expected from release sites (Eggermann et al., 2011Eggermann E. Bucurenciu I. Goswami S.P. Jonas P. Nanodomain coupling between Ca2+ channels and sensors of exocytosis at fast mammalian synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 13: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Co-staining Unc13A, Syx-1A, and Unc18 with the AZ marker BRP revealed highly specific AZ localization of Unc13A (Figure 1C; Böhme et al., 2016Böhme M.A. Beis C. Reddy-Alla S. Reynolds E. Mampell M.M. Grasskamp A.T. Lützkendorf J. Bergeron D.D. Driller J.H. Babikir H. et al.Active zone scaffolds differentially accumulate Unc13 isoforms to tune Ca(2+) channel-vesicle coupling.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), but this feature was neither shared by Syx-1A nor Unc18 (Figures 1A–1D), in agreement with observations in other systems (Pertsinidis et al., 2013Pertsinidis A.

Haucke V. et al.Composition of isolated synaptic boutons reveals the amounts of vesicle trafficking proteins.Science. 2014; 344: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). We also investigated sub-AZ specific localization using STED microscopy (lateral resolution of ∼40 nm), which revealed typical ring-like BRP structures (Figures 1E–1G, green). Unc13A predominantly localized within the BRP-ring but Syx-1A and Unc18 positive signals appeared non-specifically distributed at and in-between AZs (Figures 1E–1G). Previous STED analyses established that the voltage-sensitive N/P/Q-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunit Cacophony (Cac; exclusively mediating evoked release at the Drosophila NMJ) localizes to the center of the BRP ring, which can thus be used as a proxy for voltage-gated Ca2+ channel locations (Fouquet et al., 2009Fouquet W.

Mettke C. et al.RIM-binding protein, a central part of the active zone, is essential for neurotransmitter release.Science. 2011; 334: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To quantitatively compare local protein distributions and their respective distance to the Ca2+ channels in the AZ center, we calculated mean fluorescence profiles across many aligned AZs (see STAR Methods). Unlike the highly specific Unc13A localization (Böhme et al., 2016Böhme M.A. Beis C. Reddy-Alla S. Reynolds E. Mampell M.M. Grasskamp A.T. Lützkendorf J. Bergeron D.D. Driller J.H. Babikir H. et al.Active zone scaffolds differentially accumulate Unc13 isoforms to tune Ca(2+) channel-vesicle coupling.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), fluorescence profiles of Unc18 and Syx-1A were fairly flat (Figure 1H), indicating rather uniform protein distributions throughout AZs with only minor enrichment 90 and 110 nm from the AZ center, respectively. Because the number of release sites limits synaptic transmission, single AZ activities should positively correlate with the local levels of proteins that are limiting reagents for their generation. We investigated this at Drosophila larval NMJ AZs (which are intrinsically heterogeneous regarding their activity and protein levels) by imaging of a post-synaptically expressed fluorescent Ca2+ indicator (GCaMP) that enables visualization of presynaptic release events with single SV resolution (Melom et al., 2013Melom J.E. Akbergenova Y. Gavornik J.P. Littleton J.T. Spontaneous and evoked release are independently regulated at individual active zones.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 17253-17263Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, Newman et al., 2017Newman Z.L. Hoagland A. Aghi K. Worden K. Levy S.L. Son J.H. Lee L.P. Isacoff E.Y. Input-specific plasticity and homeostasis at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction.Neuron. 2017; 93: 1388-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). AZ activities during AP stimulation (36 APs at 0.2 Hz) were imaged, the larvae fixed and co-stained against BRP (to recognize AZs) together with Unc13A, Unc18, or Syx1A (Figures 1I–1L). Aligning these stainings to live movies allowed us to quantify how often individual AZs were active in relation to local protein levels (Figures 1K and 1L; Movie S1). In line with previous analyses, we found strong correlations of AP evoked AZ activities with local BRP levels (Muhammad et al., 2015Muhammad K. Reddy-Alla S. Driller J.H. Schreiner D. Rey U. Böhme M.A. Hollmann C. Ramesh N. Depner H. Lützkendorf J. et al.Presynaptic spinophilin tunes neurexin signalling to control active zone architecture and function.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8362Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, Peled et al., 2014Peled E.S. Newman Z.L. Isacoff E.Y. Evoked and spontaneous transmission favored by distinct sets of synapses.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 484-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activities correlated strongly with local Unc13A and Syx-1A levels, but not with those of Unc18 (Figures 1K and 1L). Because the number of release sites per synapse is constant (Neher, 2010Neher E. What is rate-limiting during sustained synaptic activity: vesicle supply or the availability of release sites.Front. Synaptic Neurosci. 2010; 2: 144Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a stable AZ localization of release site defining proteins is expected. We therefore quantified the in vivo mobility of GFP-tagged Unc13A, Syx-1A, and Unc18 by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Importantly, these GFP-fusion proteins were found at positions typical for the endogenous proteins in live imaging experiments of anesthetized larvae (compare Figures 1A–1C and 1M–1O). After imaging baseline fluorescence (Figures 1M–1O, “pre”), single boutons were bleached with high laser power, leading to very low fluorescence post bleaching (Figures 1M–1P, “post”). While fluorescence recovered within few minutes in the cases of Unc18-GFP and Syx-1A-GFP, Unc13A-GFP fluorescence showed essentially no recovery in the same time frame (Figures 1M–1Q, “300 s”). In fact, its recovery was so slow, that its time constant of ∼7 hr could only be measured in repeated imaging sessions (Figures S1A and S1B). Taken together, we find that only Unc13A shares all features expected for a release site generating molecule: it has well-defined, stable sub-AZ localization and is a local predictor of AZ-activity. That AZ-scaffold sizes predict the propensity to engage in AP-evoked synaptic activity was previously described (Holderith et al., 2012Holderith N. Lorincz A. Katona G. Rózsa B. Kulik A. Watanabe M. Nusser Z. Release probability of hippocampal glutamatergic terminals scales with the size of the active zone.Nat.

Biol. 2014; 24: 484-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To understand whether this relation is exclusive to evoked transmission or whether it extends to AP-independent spontaneous activity, we performed experiments where spontaneous AZ activities were first imaged for 100 s without stimulation before APs were elicited to stimulate release from the same set of AZs (Figure S2A). Both transmission modes induced similar postsynaptic activation (Figure S2B; GCaMP amplitudes: spontaneous [spont.]: 677.1 ± 18.6 arbitrary units [a.u.]; evoked: 682.8 ± 18.8 a.u.; mean ± SEM; p = 0.9378, Mann-Whitney U test) and occurred from overlapping as well as from distinct AZs during our observation time (Figures S2A and S2E). This agrees with previous findings (Melom et al., 2013Melom J.E. Akbergenova Y. Gavornik J.P. Littleton J.T. Spontaneous and evoked release are independently regulated at individual active zones.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 17253-17263Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, Muhammad et al., 2015Muhammad K. Reddy-Alla S. Driller J.H. Schreiner D. Rey U. Böhme M.A. Hollmann C. Ramesh N. Depner H. Lützkendorf J. et al.Presynaptic spinophilin tunes neurexin signalling to control active zone architecture and function.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8362Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, and unlike reported for spontaneous AZ activity in Drosophila null mutants of the SV GTPase Rab3 (Peled et al., 2014Peled E.S. Newman Z.L. Isacoff E.Y. Evoked and spontaneous transmission favored by distinct sets of synapses.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 484-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), spontaneous activity tracked with postsynaptic GCaMP in a wild-type background was highly positively correlated to local BRP levels (Figures S2C and S2D). As was the case for AP-evoked transmission, spontaneous activity also scaled linearly with local Unc13A levels (Figures S2C and S2D), suggesting a dependence of both transmission modes on BRP/Unc13A. Because both BRP and Unc13A levels predicted the functional AZ status, we next investigated their causal relationship. Unc13A directly interacts with BRP (Böhme et al., 2016Böhme M.A. Beis C. Reddy-Alla S. Reynolds E. Mampell M.M. Grasskamp A.T. Lützkendorf J. Bergeron D.D. Driller J.H. Babikir H. et al.Active zone scaffolds differentially accumulate Unc13 isoforms to tune Ca(2+) channel-vesicle coupling.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and its AZ levels scale proportionally to BRP (Figure 2A). Thus, BRP may affect release indirectly, by recruiting Unc13A to generate release sites. If this were the case, we would expect Unc13A manipulation to alter the coupling between AZ-scaffold size (i.e., BRP levels) and its release status. This we tested by RNAi-mediated Unc13A knockdown (KD) in motoneurons, which reduced Unc13A levels, but did not affect postsynaptic (GCaMP) activation by SV release in either transmission mode (Figures 2A and 2C). Analysis of the unc13Anull phenotype in conventional electrophysiological recordings revealed increased spontaneous transmission and decreased AP-evoked release (Böhme et al., 2016Böhme M.A. Beis C. Reddy-Alla S. Reynolds E. Mampell M.M. Grasskamp A.T. Lützkendorf J. Bergeron D.D. Driller J.H. Babikir H. et al.Active zone scaffolds differentially accumulate Unc13 isoforms to tune Ca(2+) channel-vesicle coupling.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and we saw similar tendencies at single AZs following Unc13A knockdown (Figures 2B and 2D). Moreover, the activity profile of AZs dedicated to specific transmission modes shifted and a larger AZ fraction was exclusively active spontaneously during our recordings (Figure 2G). Importantly, Unc13A knockdown weakened the relationship between the AZ levels of Unc13A and BRP (Figure 2A), allowing us to test whether this impaired Unc13A recruitment weakened the relation between AZ activity and BRP levels. Indeed, the predictive value of BRP levels for the AZ activity status was reduced in both transmission modes (Figures 2E and 2F), arguing that the correlation between AZ activity and AZ size depends on scaffold-mediated Unc13A recruitment to generate release sites. The two Drosophila Unc13 isoforms, Unc13A and Unc13B, localize differentially within single AZs (Böhme et al., 2016Böhme M.A. Beis C. Reddy-Alla S. Reynolds E. Mampell M.M. Grasskamp A.T.

They differ in their N-terminal parts but harbor identical C-terminal halves containing the MUN domain essential for vesicle priming (Basu et al., 2005Basu J. Shen N. Dulubova I. Lu J. Guan R.

This agrees with observations in other systems: at mammalian and C. elegans AZs, (M)Unc13 localization depends on an N-terminal C2A domain (Deng et al., 2011Deng L. Kaeser P.S. Xu W. Südhof T.C.

Hippocampal place cells represent the cellular substrate of episodic memory. Place cell ensembles reorganize to support learning but must also maintain stable representations to facilitate memory recall. Despite extensive research, the learning-related role of place cell dynamics in health and disease remains elusive. Using chronic two-photon Ca2+ imaging in hippocampal area CA1 of wild-type and Df(16)A+/− mice, an animal model of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, one of the most common genetic risk factors for cognitive dysfunction and schizophrenia, we found that goal-oriented learning in wild-type mice was supported by stable spatial maps and robust remapping of place fields toward the goal location. Df(16)A+/− mice showed a significant learning deficit accompanied by reduced spatial map stability and the absence of goal-directed place cell reorganization. These results expand our understanding of the hippocampal ensemble dynamics supporting cognitive flexibility and demonstrate their importance in a model of 22q11.2-associated cognitive dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2750818570,"We serendipitously discovered that the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri induces sexual reproduction in one of the closest living relatives of animals, the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta. Although bacteria influence everything from nutrition and metabolism to cell biology and development in eukaryotes, bacterial regulation of eukaryotic mating was unexpected. Here, we show that a single V. fischeri protein, the previously uncharacterized EroS, fully recapitulates the aphrodisiac-like activity of live V. fischeri. EroS is a chondroitin lyase; although its substrate, chondroitin sulfate, was previously thought to be an animal synapomorphy, we demonstrate that S. rosetta produces chondroitin sulfate and thus extend the ancestry of this important glycosaminoglycan to the premetazoan era. Finally, we show that V. fischeri, purified EroS, and other bacterial chondroitin lyases induce S. rosetta mating at environmentally relevant concentrations, suggesting that bacteria likely regulate choanoflagellate mating in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2752333387,"Chromatin modification and higher-order chromosome structure play key roles in gene regulation, but their functional interplay in controlling gene expression is elusive. We have discovered the machinery and mechanism underlying the dynamic enrichment of histone modification H4K20me1 on hermaphrodite X chromosomes during C. elegans dosage compensation and demonstrated H4K20me1's pivotal role in regulating higher-order chromosome structure and X-chromosome-wide gene expression. The structure and the activity of the dosage compensation complex (DCC) subunit DPY-21 define a Jumonji demethylase subfamily that converts H4K20me2 to H4K20me1 in worms and mammals. Selective inactivation of demethylase activity eliminates H4K20me1 enrichment in somatic cells, elevates X-linked gene expression, reduces X chromosome compaction, and disrupts X chromosome conformation by diminishing the formation of topologically associating domains (TADs). Unexpectedly, DPY-21 also associates with autosomes of germ cells in a DCC-independent manner to enrich H4K20me1 and trigger chromosome compaction. Our findings demonstrate the direct link between chromatin modification and higher-order chromosome structure in long-range regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2752495775,"We have previously shown that the Outer surface protein A (OspA) based Lyme borreliosis vaccine VLA15 induces protective immunity in mice. Herein, we report the induction of protective immunity by VLA15 with mouse models using ticks infected with B. burgdorferi (OspA serotype 1), B. afzelii (OspA serotype 2) and B. bavariensis (OspA serotype 4) or with in vitro grown B. garinii (OspA serotype 5 and 6) for challenge. For B. garinii (OspA serotype 3), we have developed a growth inhibition assay using chicken complement and functional antibodies targeting B. garinii (OspA serotype 3) could be demonstrated after immunization with VLA15. Furthermore, following three priming immunizations, a booster dose was administered five months later and the induction of immunological memory could be confirmed. Thus, the antibody titers after the booster dose were increased considerably compared to those after primary immunization. In addition, the half-lives of anti-OspA serotype specific antibodies after administration of the booster immunization were longer than after primary immunization. Taken together, we could show that VLA15 induced protection in mice against challenge with four different clinically relevant Borrelia species (B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii, B. garinii and B. bavariensis) expressing five of the six OspA serotypes included in the vaccine. The protection data is supported by functional assays showing efficacy against spirochetes expressing any of the six OspA serotypes (1 to 6). To our knowledge, this is the first time a Lyme borreliosis vaccine has been able to demonstrate such broad protection in preclinical studies. These new data provide further promise for the clinical development of VLA15 and supports our efforts to provide a new Lyme borreliosis vaccine available for global use."

Although the crosslinking function of LOXL2 has been characterized in many biological systems, it is not known whether proteolytic processing regulates its enzymatic activity (30Moon H.J. Finney J. Ronnebaum T. Mure M. Human lysyl oxidase-like 2.Bioorg. Chem. 2014; 57: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of LOXL2 processing on the crosslinking of the 7S domain of collagen IV, a key structural component of basement membranes. We identified the cleavage site in LOXL2 sequence by classical Edman microsequencing and site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, using CRISPR-Cas9 system, we developed a LOXL2-null cell line that allowed us to explore the effect of proteolytic processing on LOXL2 enzymatic activity. Our results suggest that LOXL2 proteolytic processing is a regulatory step on collagen IV and basement membranes biosynthesis. To purify sufficient 65-kDa extracellular form of LOXL2 for the identification of the site of proteolytic cleavage by Edman microsequencing, we stably expressed the LOXL2 human ORF (NM_002318) in HEK293 cells (7Añazco C.

Immunoblotting characterization of HEK293 cells expressing this construct using a polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal region of the LOXL2 sequence showed that the intracellular fraction produced the full-length form of LOXL2 (∼100 kDa) without any sign of proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the conditioned media of these cells showed the presence of both full-length and processed forms of LOXL2, similar to those observed in other cell types (24Akiri G. Sabo E. Dafni H.

We purified LOXL2 forms from cell media by affinity chromatography and fractionated proteins by SDS-PAGE. The 65-kDa processed form was cut out of the gel and prepared for N-terminal Edman microsequencing. The results revealed the first 11 amino acid residues of processed form N-terminal end starting at Ala-318 of human LOXL2 sequence, indicating that proteolytic processing occurred at Lys-317. This site resides in the linker region between the SRCR2 and SRCR3 domains (Fig. 1B). Further inspection of the sequence showed that the P1 and P2 positions from the Lys-317 processing site are occupied by basic residues that are highly conserved in LOXL2 sequences of vertebrates (Fig. 1C). The presence of these basic residues in P1 and P2 suggests that a serine protease cleaves LOXL2 at Lys-317. To test this hypothesis, HEK293 cells stably expressing human LOXL2 were grown in media containing serine protease inhibitors including leupeptin, aprotinin, and PMSF (Fig. 1D). Immunoblotting analyses of the culture media from these cells showed that the formation of the 65-kDa LOXL2 processed form was significantly reduced by aprotinin and PMSF, but not leupeptin, suggesting that serine proteases may be responsible for LOXL2 cleavage. HEK293 cells were also cultured in the presence of decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (Dec-RVKR-CMK), an inhibitor that blocks the activity of members of the subtilisin-like family of proprotein convertases such as furin (31Denault J.B.

As shown in Fig. 1D, Dec-RVKR-CMK exhibited the highest inhibition of LOXL2 processing. Pepstatin, a potent inhibitor of aspartyl proteases, had no effect on LOXL2 cleavage. In summary, these data suggest that LOXL2 is proteolytically processed by a serine protease at Lys-317 in the extracellular compartment, removing the first two SRCR domains from LOXL2 sequence. To evaluate the effect of proteolytic processing on amine oxidase activity, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to generate either full-length or processed forms of LOXL2. To block proteolytic processing and generate a full-length LOXL2 form, the two basic residues preceding the cleavage site were mutated from RK to GE. The introduction of negatively charged glutamic acid at P1 was expected to block proteolytic processing by serine proteases (32Remacle A.G. Shiryaev S.A. Oh E.S. Cieplak P. Srinivasan A. Wei G.

Transient expression of this construct in HEK293 cells predominantly generated the full-length form of LOXL2, indicating that proteolytic processing was abrogated (Fig. 2A). Initial studies in which only Lys-317 was mutated uncovered an anticipated atypical form of LOXL2 of about 70 kDa that is not observed in cells expressing wild-type LOXL2. A careful inspection of LOXL2 sequence identified Arg-256 as a potential cleavage site of serine proteases. Thus, to completely eliminate proteolytic processing and generate the full-length 100-kDa form, Arg-257 was mutated to glycine in addition to 316–317 residues RK (Fig. 2A). LOXL2BP was used to describe this “blocked processing LOXL2 mutant” construct. As most serine proteases have a preference for Arg at P1 (33Duckert P. Brunak S. Blom N.

Cleavage specificity analysis of six type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) using PICS with proteome-derived peptide libraries.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e105984Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we generated a second mutant by changing Lys-317 to Arg-317 to potentially enhance proteolytic cleavage. The resulting K317R processing LOXL2 mutant was named LOXL2K317R. To evaluate the effect of mutagenesis on proteolytic processing, these two new LOXL2BP and LOXL2K317R constructs, together with the catalytically inactive LOXL2Y689F mutant and wild-type LOXL2 as controls, were expressed in HEK293 cells. Immunoblot analyses for LOXL2 detection in whole cell extracts showed that all constructs produced LOXL2 proteins of 100 kDa. However, LOXL2 processing differences became evident when analyzing culture media containing the extracellular forms of LOXL2. As expected, the LOXLBP construct produced only the 100-kDa form. In contrast to the wild-type construct, the LOXLK317R construct showed a significant increase of the 65-kDa processed LOXL2 form (Fig. 2B). To assess the effect of proteolytic processing on the amine oxidase activity, conditioned media of cells expressing LOXL2 wild type and mutants were assayed with Amplex Red assay using 1,5-diaminopentane as substrate (35Palamakumbura A.H. Trackman P.C. A fluorometric assay for detection of lysyl oxidase enzyme activity in biological samples.Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, the amine oxidase activity showed no significant difference between processing mutants and wild-type LOXL2. These results show that cleavage at Lys-317 does not influence LOXL2 amine oxidase activity. To evaluate the role of LOXL2 proteolytic processing on collagen IV crosslinking, we generated a LOXL2-null PFRH9 cell line by using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to target exon 2 of the mouse Loxl2 gene (Fig. 3A). Immunoblot analysis of the ECM-derived fraction, where both 100-kDa and 65-kDa forms are normally deposited in the wild-type cells, showed that both LOXL2 forms are absent in the knock-out cell line (Fig. 3B). In addition, no residual amine oxidase activity inhibited by BAPN was detected in LOXL2-null cell conditioned medium (Fig. 3C). Fig. 3D shows that 7S dodecamers extracted after collagenase digestion of the ECM derived from LOXL2-null PFHR9 cells are composed of only 7S monomeric subunits, confirming our previous crosslinking studies using pharmacological inhibitors of lysyl oxidase activity (7Añazco C. López-Jiménez A.J. Rafi M. Vega-Montoto L. Zhang M.Z. Hudson B.G. Vanacore R.M. Lysyl oxidase-like-2 cross-links collagen IV of glomerular basement membrane.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 25999-26012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the nonreduced 7S dodecamer of the LOXL2-null cells showed slightly faster electrophoretic mobility in comparison to the wild-type cells (Fig. 3E). These results show that LOXL2 is the sole source of lysyl oxidase activity for crosslinking the 7S dodecamer of collagen IV in PFHR9 cells. Furthermore, generation of a LOXL2-null PFHR9 cell line provides an excellent system to test the effect of LOXL2 proteolytic processing on collagen IV crosslinking. To evaluate the 7S crosslinking activity of LOXL2 processing mutants, these constructs were expressed in the LOXL2-null PFHR9 cells. As expected, monomeric 7S subunits are predominant in the catalytically defective LOXL2Y689F mutant, indicating that the enzyme failed to reestablish the crosslinking profile observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, the 7S dodecamer from wild-type LOXL2 and the enhanced processing mutant LOXL2K317R exhibited the typical crosslinking profile of oligomeric forms observed in wild-type cells. Surprisingly, the full-length, processing defective mutant LOXL2BP failed to crosslink the 7S dodecamer. These results demonstrate that, despite being catalytically active, the full-length processing mutant LOXL2BP was unable to crosslink the 7S dodecamer. These results suggest that removal of the first two SRCR domains by proteolytic processing is required for effective collagen IV crosslinking in the insoluble matrix. Although full-length and processed forms of LOXL2 have been reported to localize in the ECM of different tissues (7Añazco C. López-Jiménez A.J. Rafi M. Vega-Montoto L. Zhang M.Z. Hudson B.G.

Lysyl oxidase-like protein-2 regulates sprouting angiogenesis and type IV collagen assembly in the endothelial basement membrane.Blood. 2011; 118: 3979-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), our results showed that only the processed LOXL2 crosslinks the 7S dodecamer. Thus, we hypothesized that the processed, but not the full-length, form of LOXL2 interacts with collagen IV. To test this hypothesis, we performed a collagenase digestion to solubilize proteins interacting with the insoluble collagen IV scaffold. As we wanted to detect a potential LOXL2–7S dodecamer interaction, we first performed immunoblotting analyses of purified LOXL2 to characterize its electrophoretic mobility under reducing and nonreducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 5A, under nonreducing conditions the full-length and processed LOXL2 forms migrated with an apparent molecular mass of ∼75 and ∼45 kDa, respectively. The faster electrophoretic mobility of both LOXL2 forms is consistent with the presence of many disulfide bridges that restrain the polypeptide chain yielding a smaller apparent molecular mass in SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting analyses of collagenase-soluble proteins from wild-type PFHR9 matrix show a 45-kDa band equivalent to that of processed LOXL2 (Fig. 5B, right panel). Surprisingly, the immunoblot also showed an unexpected high molecular mass form of LOXL2 with an electrophoretic mobility slightly slower than the 7S dodecamer shown in the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5B). None of these two LOXL2 forms were observed in the collagenase digest of LOXL2-null PFHR9 matrix (Fig. 5B, right panel). Thus, the presence of the high molecular mass LOXL2 form suggests a stable interaction between processed LOXL2 and the 7S dodecamer that is resistant to the highly dissociative conditions of SDS-PAGE analysis. To further characterize the interaction between 7S dodecamer and processed LOXL2, we performed immunoblotting analyses of purified 7S dodecamer, urea-soluble, and collagenase-soluble PHFR9 matrix proteins under reducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 5C, some bands are similar, but there are striking differences in the number and size of LOXL2 forms. Consistent with a LOXL2–7S dodecamer interaction, the unbound 65-kDa processed LOXL2 form was not detected in purified 7S dodecamer (Fig. 5C, left panel), as it is likely removed during chromatographic purification. However, a ladder of three or more additional bands, larger than the 65-kDa processed LOXL2, was observed in purified 7S dodecamer samples and collagenase digests of PFHR9 and glomerular matrices (Fig. 5C). Of note, the bands detected in the collagenase digest of bovine glomerular matrix showed a more complex pattern, which is probably a consequence of the highly heterogeneous collagenous material isolated from this tissue. The striking differences between the electrophoretic profiles of LOXL2 forms present in urea-soluble and collagenase-soluble protein samples suggest that the enzyme interacts with collagen IV in different ways (Fig. 5C, right panel). For instance, the 100-kDa full-length LOXL2 band is detected in urea-extracted proteins, but not in collagenase digests, suggesting that it does not interact with collagen. In contrast, the 65-kDa processed LOXL2 (free form, equivalent to the 45-kDa band observed under nonreducing conditions) is present in both preparations, suggesting that this form associates with collagen IV in a noncovalent fashion. Lastly, the ladder of LOXL2 bands is only present in the collagenase digest, suggesting that processed LOXL2 forms a covalent complex with peptide fragments derived from 7S dodecamer that were not digested by collagenase under native conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that processed, but not full-length, LOXL2 is bound both covalently and noncovalently to collagen IV. To validate that LOXL2 is bound to 7S polypeptides, we subjected collagenase-soluble PFHR9 proteins to pepsin digestion under nondenaturing conditions. As expected, the 7S dodecamer was resistant to pepsin digestion (Fig. 5D, left panel). However, LOXL2 was completely degraded under the same conditions (Fig. 5D, right panel), indicating that the LOXL2 signal detected by the antibody is specific despite the presence of excessively abundant 7S oligomeric subunits. In contrast, because it is possible that processed LOXL2 may have protected the attached 7S peptide fragments from collagenase digestion under native conditions, collagenase"

PANK2 has a role in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) from dietary vitamin B5, but the neuropathological mechanism and reasons for iron accumulation remain unknown. In this study, atypical patient-derived fibroblasts were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and subsequently differentiated into cortical neuronal cells for studying disease mechanisms in human neurons. We observed no changes in PANK2 expression between control and patient cells, but a reduction in protein levels was apparent in patient cells. CoA homeostasis and cellular iron handling were normal, mitochondrial function was affected; displaying activated NADH-related and inhibited FADH-related respiration, resulting in increased mitochondrial membrane potential. This led to increased reactive oxygen species generation and lipid peroxidation in patient-derived neurons. These data suggest that mitochondrial deficiency is an early feature of the disease process and can be explained by altered NADH/FADH substrate supply to oxidative phosphorylation. Intriguingly, iron chelation appeared to exacerbate the mitochondrial phenotype in both control and patient neuronal cells. This raises caution for the use iron chelation therapy in general when iron accumulation is absent."

The specific role of ceramide synthetic enzymes in the regulation of PLIN2 and promotion of hepatocellular lipid accumulation is not well understood. We examined the effects of pharmacologic ceramide synthesis inhibition on hepatic PLIN2 expression, steatosis, and glucose and lipid homeostasis in mice with alcoholic steatosis and in ethanol-incubated human hepatoma VL17A cells. In cells, pharmacologic inhibition of ceramide synthase reduced lipid accumulation by reducing PLIN2 RNA stability.

https://openalex.org/W2751577241,"Introduction The airway epithelium is a physical and immunological barrier that protects the pulmonary system from inhaled environmental insults. Uric acid has been detected in the respiratory tract and can function as an antioxidant or damage associated molecular pattern. We have demonstrated that human airway epithelial cells are a source of uric acid. Our hypothesis is that uric acid production by airway epithelial cells is induced by environmental stimuli associated with chronic respiratory diseases. We therefore examined how airway epithelial cells regulate uric acid production. Materials and methods Allergen and cigarette smoke mouse models were performed using house dust mite (HDM) and cigarette smoke exposure, respectively, with outcome measurements of lung uric acid levels. Primary human airway epithelial cells isolated from clinically diagnosed patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were grown in submerged cultures and compared to age-matched healthy controls for uric acid release. HBEC-6KT cells, a human airway epithelial cell line, were grown under submerged monolayer conditions for mechanistic and gene expression studies. Results HDM, but not cigarette smoke exposure, stimulated uric acid production in vivo and in vitro. Primary human airway epithelial cells from asthma, but not COPD patients, displayed elevated levels of extracellular uric acid in culture. In HBEC-6KT, production of uric acid was sensitive to the xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) inhibitor, allopurinol, and the ATP Binding Cassette C4 (ABCC4) inhibitor, MK-571. Lastly, the pro-inflammatory cytokine combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ elevated extracellular uric acid levels and XDH gene expression in HBEC-6KT cells. Conclusions Our results suggest that the active production of uric acid from human airway epithelial cells may be intrinsically altered in asthma and be further induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines."

Here, we investigated the anti-cancer activity of sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) isolated from Ambrosia arborescens and of synthetic derivatives in breast cancer cell lines, with a specific focus on activity against CSCs. The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, JIMT-1, and HCC1937 and the normal-like breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A were treated with the SLs damsin and coronopilin, isolated from A. arborescens, and with ambrosin and dindol-01, synthesized using damsin. Inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) values were obtained from dose-response curves. Based on IC50 values, doses in the μM range were used for investigating effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle phase distribution, cell death, micronuclei formation, and cell migration. Western blot analysis was used to investigate proteins involved in cell cycle regulation as well as in the NF-κB pathway since SLs have been shown to inhibit this transcription factor. Specific CSC effects were investigated using three CSC assays. All compounds inhibited cell proliferation; however, damsin and ambrosin were toxic at single-digit micromolar ranges, while higher concentrations were required for coronopilin and dindol-01. Of the four cell lines, the compounds had the least effect on the normal-like MCF-10A cells. The inhibition of cell proliferation can partly be explained by downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2. All compounds inhibited tumour necrosis factor-α-induced translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Damsin and ambrosin treatment increased the number of micronuclei; moreover, another sign of DNA damage was the increased level of p53. Treatment with damsin and ambrosin decreased the CSC subpopulation and inhibited cell migration. Our results suggest that these compounds should be further investigated to find efficient CSC-inhibiting compounds."

This study sought to evaluate the risks of rebleeding and thromboembolism in anticoagulated patients with acute GIB. Methods Baseline, endoscopy, and outcome data were reviewed for 314 patients with acute GIB: 157 anticoagulant users and 157 age-, sex-, and important risk-matched non-users. Data were also compared between direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and warfarin users. Results Between anticoagulant users and non-users, of whom 70% underwent early endoscopy, no endoscopy-related adverse events or significant differences were found in the rate of endoscopic therapy need, transfusion need, rebleeding, or thromboembolism. Rebleeding was associated with shock, comorbidities, low platelet count and albumin level, and low-dose aspirin use but not HAS-BLED score, any endoscopic results, heparin bridge, or international normalized ratio (INR) ≥ 2.5. Risks for thromboembolism were INR ≥ 2.5, difference in onset and pre-endoscopic INR, reversal agent use, and anticoagulant interruption but not CHA2DS2-VASc score, any endoscopic results, or heparin bridge. In patients without reversal agent use, heparin bridge, or anticoagulant interruption, there was only one rebleeding event and no thromboembolic events. Warfarin users had a significantly higher transfusion need than DOACs users. Conclusion Endoscopy appears to be safe for anticoagulant users with acute GIB compared with non-users. Patient background factors were associated with rebleeding, whereas anticoagulant management factors (e.g. INR correction, reversal agent use, and drug interruption) were associated with thromboembolism. Early intervention without reversal agent use, heparin bridge, or anticoagulant interruption may be warranted for acute GIB."

However, the mechanism by which TRIP8b exerts these dual effects is still poorly understood.

That interaction, which requires a small central portion of TRIP8b termed TRIP8bcore, is both necessary and sufficient for reducing the cAMP-dependent regulation of HCN channels. Here, using fluorescence anisotropy, we report that TRIP8b binding to the CNBD of HCN2 channels decreases the apparent affinity of cAMP for the CNBD. We explored two possible mechanisms for this inhibition. A noncompetitive mechanism in which TRIP8b inhibits the conformational change of the CNBD associated with cAMP regulation and a competitive mechanism in which TRIP8b and cAMP compete for the same binding site. To test these two mechanisms, we used a combination of fluorescence anisotropy, biolayer interferometry, and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy. Fitting these models to our fluorescence anisotropy binding data revealed that, surprisingly, the TRIP8b-dependent reduction of cAMP binding to the CNBD can largely be explained by partial competition between TRIP8b and cAMP.

https://openalex.org/W2751666081,"Mobilization of intracellular calcium is essential for a wide range of cellular processes, including signal transduction, apoptosis, and vesicular trafficking. Several lines of evidence have suggested that apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG-2, also known as PDCD6), a calcium-binding protein, acts as a calcium sensor linking calcium levels with efficient vesicular trafficking, especially at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport step. However, how ALG-2 regulates these processes remains largely unclear. Here, we report that MAPK1-interacting and spindle-stabilizing (MISS)-like (MISSL), a previously uncharacterized protein, interacts with ALG-2 in a calcium-dependent manner. Live-cell imaging revealed that upon a rise in intracellular calcium levels, GFP-tagged MISSL (GFP-MISSL) dynamically relocalizes in a punctate pattern and colocalizes with ALG-2. MISSL knockdown caused disorganization of the components of the ER exit site, the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and Golgi. Importantly, knockdown of either MISSL or ALG-2 attenuated the secretion of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), a model secreted cargo protein, with similar reductions in secretion by single- and double-protein knockdowns, suggesting that MISSL and ALG-2 act in the same pathway to regulate the secretion process. Furthermore, ALG-2 or MISSL knockdown delayed ER-to-Golgi transport of procollagen type I. We also found that ALG-2 and MISSL interact with microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) and that MAP1B knockdown reverts the reduced secretion of SEAP caused by MISSL or ALG-2 depletion.

Through sequence comparison among regions of ALIX, Sec31A, and PLSCR3 responsible for binding with ALG-2, we previously identified two different types of binding motif of ALG-2, and we designated the motifs as ALG-2-binding motif (ABM)-1 and ABM-2 (17Shibata H.

The ALG-2 homodimer is able to bind to two different proteins simultaneously and thereby can function as an adaptor to regulate calcium-dependent cellular processes.

ALG-2 also binds to Trk-fused gene (TFG) molecules to promote TFG polymerization by its adaptor function (24Kanadome T. Shibata H. Kuwata K. Takahara T. Maki M.

Several recent studies have suggested that ALG-2 regulates the secretory pathway at the ER-to-Golgi transport step. In in vitro experiments, ALG-2 was shown to inhibit homotypic fusion of COPII vesicles (25Bentley M. Nycz D.C. Joglekar A. Fertschai I. Malli R. Graier W.F. Hay J.C. Vesicular calcium regulates coat retention, fusogenicity, and size of pre-Golgi intermediates.Mol. Biol.

ALG-2 attenuates COPII budding in vitro and stabilizes the Sec23/Sec31A complex.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e75309Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although the effects of ALG-2 on the fusion and budding remain to be established in vivo. More recent studies have suggested that ALG-2 may regulate ER-to-Golgi transport at least in the specific cellular context in vivo (7Helm J.R. Bentley M. Thorsen K.D. Wang T. Foltz L. Oorschot V.

Penta-EF-hand protein peflin is a negative regulator of ER-To-Golgi transport.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11: e0157227Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Knockdown of ALG-2 or its binding partner annexin A11 enhanced the rate of ER-to-Golgi transport of a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) in HT1080 cells (16Shibata H.

Chem. 2015; 290: 4981-4993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas no difference in the rate of transport was observed in HeLa cells (12Yamasaki A. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. Komada M. The Ca2+-binding protein ALG-2 is recruited to endoplasmic reticulum exit sites by Sec31A and stabilizes the localization of Sec31A.Mol. Biol.

Apoptosis-linked gene-2 (ALG-2)/Sec31 interactions regulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport: a potential effector pathway for luminal calcium.J. Biol.

In addition, knockdown of peflin, potentially leading to an increase in the population of ALG-2 homodimers, promotes ER-to-Golgi transport (27Rayl M. Truitt M. Held A. Sargeant J. Thorsen K. Hay J.C. Penta-EF-hand protein peflin is a negative regulator of ER-To-Golgi transport.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11: e0157227Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, ALG-2 may be an important calcium sensor linking intracellular and/or luminal calcium levels with regulatory machinery of the secretory pathway. Indeed, it was reported recently that the ALG-2–peflin heterodimer acts as a coadaptor relaying a transient calcium rise into CUL3-mediated Sec31A ubiquitylation, allowing the formation of large COPII vesicles responsible for collagen secretion (28McGourty C.A. Akopian D. Walsh C. Gorur A. Werner A. Schekman R. Bautista D. Rape M. Regulation of the CUL3 ubiquitin ligase by a calcium-dependent co-adaptor.Cell. 2016; 167: 525-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although the regulatory mechanism(s) of ALG-2 for general ER-to-Golgi transport in response to an alteration of the calcium level remains largely unknown. We previously searched for novel ALG-2-interacting proteins through in silico screening based on the presence of ALG-2-binding motifs within proline-rich regions, and we found several new candidate proteins by far-Western analysis (29Osugi K. Suzuki H. Nomura T. Ariumi Y. Shibata H. Maki M. Identification of the P-body component PATL1 as a novel ALG-2-interacting protein by in silico and far-Western screening of proline-rich proteins.J. Biochem. 2012; 151: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One of the candidates is MAPK1-interacting and spindle-stabilizing (MISS)-like (MISSL). Although the primary sequence of MISSL is similar to that of MISS (30Lefebvre C. Terret M.E. Djiane A. Rassinier P. Maro B. Verlhac M.-H. Meiotic spindle stability depends on MAPK-interacting and spindle-stabilizing protein (MISS), a new MAPK substrate.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the functional regions of MISS, including a MAPK-docking site, a PEST sequence, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal, are lacking in MISSL, and the cellular function of MISSL has therefore remained completely unknown. In this study, we found that MISSL indeed interacts with ALG-2 in a calcium-dependent manner and that MISSL and ALG-2 act in the same pathway regulating the secretion process. Furthermore, our results suggest that ALG-2 links MISSL and microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) in a calcium-dependent manner, which likely plays an important role in the regulation of efficient secretion. We previously identified several potential ALG-2-binding proteins through in silico screening and far-Western blotting using biotin-labeled ALG-2 as a probe (29Osugi K. Suzuki H. Nomura T. Ariumi Y. Shibata H. Maki M. Identification of the P-body component PATL1 as a novel ALG-2-interacting protein by in silico and far-Western screening of proline-rich proteins.J. Biochem. 2012; 151: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we focused on MISSL, a previously uncharacterized protein, and examined further whether MISSL indeed binds to ALG-2. To examine the interaction between MISSL and ALG-2, GFP-tagged MISSL (GFP-MISSL) was transiently expressed in HeLa cells and was tested for interaction with endogenous ALG-2 (Fig. 1A). Endogenous ALG-2 was coimmunoprecipitated with GFP-MISSL but not with GFP, and the interaction was diminished in the presence of EGTA, a calcium chelator. To determine whether endogenous MISSL interacts with endogenous ALG-2 as well, endogenous MISSL was immunoprecipitated using an anti-MISSL antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, ALG-2 was coimmunoprecipitated with MISSL in the presence of calcium but not EGTA. Together, these results suggest that MISSL is a bona fide ALG-2-interacting partner. Our previous results indicated that ALG-2 preferentially binds to two different types of motifs (ABM-1 and ABM-2) present in proline-rich regions (9Suzuki H. Kawasaki M. Inuzuka T. Okumura M.

Sci. 2015; 16: 3677-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). MISSL contains two ABM-1-like sequences as shown in Fig. 1C. To determine whether the two sites are essential for binding with ALG-2, we compared the interactions of GFP-MISSL and a mutant (GFP-MISSLΔΔ) lacking the two sequences (101–117 and 167–175 amino acids) with ALG-2. GFP-MISSL and GFP-MISSLΔΔ showed similar interactions with ALG-2 by immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 1D), suggesting that MISSL is still able to bind to ALG-2 through a region different from the two sequences. To narrow down the ALG-2-binding site(s) in MISSL, GFP-MISSL, and its N- or C-terminal deletion mutants were transiently expressed, and their binding abilities were tested by far-Western blotting using biotin-labeled ALG-2 as a probe (Fig. 1E). Deletion of either the N-terminal (Δ1–138) or C-terminal region (Δ93–245 and Δ147–245) dramatically reduced the binding of ALG-2. Similarly, endogenous ALG-2 was efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with the full-length and Δ1–90 mutant but to a lesser extent with Δ1–138, Δ93–245, and Δ147–245 mutants (Fig. 1F). Thus, MISSL appears to bind to ALG-2 through multiple sites in the whole region, attributed to high proline-rich contents in MISSL. The involvement of multiple sites in the interaction with ALG-2 is also found in proteins containing ABM-1-like, such as TSG101, VPS37B, and VPS37C, and it has been difficult to identify particular sites sufficient for binding to ALG-2 in those proteins (data not shown). We also cannot rule out the possibility that the deletion of the N- or C-terminal portion of MISSL (e.g. Δ1–138 or Δ147–245) perturbs the tertiary structure or conformation of the remaining region, thereby leading to the reduced binding to ALG-2. To investigate the subcellular localization of MISSL in living cells, GFP-MISSL was transiently expressed in HeLa cells, and the localization was observed through live cell imaging. We also expressed a fluorescent calcium indicator, R-GECO1 (31Zhao Y. Araki S. Wu J. Teramoto T. Chang Y.-F. Nakano M. Abdelfattah A.S. Fujiwara M. Ishihara T. Nagai T. Campbell R.E. An expanded palette of genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators.Science. 2011; 333: 1888-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), to monitor the intracellular calcium rise simultaneously. To increase intracellular calcium by a physiological condition, we used amino acid addition to amino acid-starved cells, a known treatment to increase intracellular calcium (32Gulati P. Gaspers L.D. Dann S.G. Joaquin M. Nobukuni T. Natt F. Kozma S.C. Thomas A.P. Thomas G. Amino acids activate mTOR complex 1 via Ca2+/CaM signaling to hVps34.Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 456-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Under the amino acid-starved condition, GFP-MISSL was diffusely distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 2A, −AA). Upon amino acid addition, intracellular calcium was increased as shown by the enhanced fluorescence signal of R-GECO1 (Fig. 2, A and B), and GFP-MISSL rapidly relocalized to the punctate pattern (Fig. 2A, +AA, and supplemental movie S1). Similar relocalization of GFP-MISSL was also observed when thapsigargin (TG), a SERCA inhibitor, was used to artificially increase the cytosolic calcium level (Fig. 2C, t = 83 s). Furthermore, the appearance of the GFP-MISSL puncta was transient and correlated with the intracellular calcium rise, because GFP-MISSL puncta disappeared at the time when the intracellular calcium level returned to the original level, which was monitored by R-GECO1 fluorescent signal changes (Fig. 2, C and D, and supplemental movie S2). To determine whether ALG-2 is involved in the GFP-MISSL relocalization, we first examined whether the GFP-MISSL puncta colocalized with ALG-2. To this end, both GFP-MISSL and mCherry-tagged ALG-2 (mCh-ALG2) were transiently expressed in HeLa cells. Under the amino acid-starved condition, most of the GFP-MISSL and mCh-ALG-2 were diffuse throughout the cells, but a small population of GFP-MISSL tended to form small puncta that overlapped with mCh-ALG-2 puncta (Fig. 3A, −AA, inset). Upon intracellular calcium rise caused by amino acid replenishment, mCh-ALG-2 also dynamically changed its location and formed large puncta (Fig. 3A, +AA). Consistent with MISSL binding to ALG-2 (Fig. 1, A and B), GFP-MISSL puncta were overlapped with mCh-ALG-2 puncta upon calcium rise (Fig. 3A, +AA, Merge and graph). To further examine whether the GFP-MISSL relocalization relies on ALG-2, the cellular ALG-2 level was reduced by an RNA interference method (Fig. 3, B and C). Depletion of ALG-2 significantly reduced GFP-MISSL puncta formation, although the degrees of calcium rise after amino acid supplementation were similar in both cell types (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, GFP-MISSLΔ147–245, which failed to bind to ALG-2 (Fig. 1), did not relocalize to ALG-2-positive dots upon amino acid replenishment (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that ALG-2 recruits MISSL to the sites where ALG-2 functions upon calcium rise. ALG-2 is known to bind several proteins (19Maki M. Takahara T. Shibata H.

We extracted the knowledge about 174 varieties from the dataset, which contained information about weather, soil, yield and regional statistical parameters. Next, we predicted the yield of each variety in each of 6,490 observed subregions of the Midwest. Furthermore, yield was predicted for all the possible weather scenarios approximated by 15 historical weather instances contained in the dataset. Using predicted yields and covariance between varieties through different weather scenarios, we performed portfolio optimisation. In this way, for each subregion, we obtained a selection of varieties, that proved superior to others in terms of the amount and stability of yield. According to the rules of Syngenta Crop Challenge, for which this research was conducted, we aggregated the results across all subregions and selected up to five soybean varieties that should be distributed across the network of seed retailers. The work presented in this paper was the winning solution for Syngenta Crop Challenge 2017."
https://openalex.org/W2753325553,"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a contagious agent of Newcastle disease in avian species and seriously affects the poultry industry. The cleavage site of the viral F protein (Fcs) is a key determinant of membrane fusion and viral virulence. In this study, we investigated the precise effect of variable amino acid sequences of the Fcs on fusogenic activity. Based on viral pathogenicity, the Fcs sequences of natural isolates (n = 1572) are classified into eight types of virulent Fcs (VFcs) with the motif ""G/R/K-R-Q/R/K-R/K-R↓F"" and ten types of the avirulent Fcs (AFcs) with the motif ""G/R/E-R/K/Q-Q-G/E-R↓L"". The VFcs is only found in the Class II cluster of viral classification and not in Class I. The AFcs exists in both Class I and II isolates. The VFc and AFc types present an evolutionary relationship with temporal distribution and host species. Using a fusion assay in vitro, VFcs-1 ""RRQKR↓F"" and VFcs-2 ""RRQRR↓F"" show the highest efficiency in triggering membrane fusion. The neutral residue Q at the P3 position of the VFcs plays an enhancing role compared to effect of the basic residues R and K. A single residue K at P3 or P5 is less efficient of the fusogenic activity in the VFcs with all basic residues. Moreover, the cleavage efficiencies of F0 proteins with different types of Fcs motifs do not appear to affect membrane fusion. Our findings offer insight into the effect of amino acid variation of the Fcs on the fusion triggered by NDV."

Co-expression of CaVα2δ1 with CaVβ/CaVα1 proteins reconstitutes the functional properties of native L-type currents, but the interacting domains at the CaV1.2/CaVα2δ1 interface are unknown. Here, a homology-based model of CaV1.2 identified protein interfaces between the extracellular domain of CaVα2δ1 and the extracellular loops of the CaVα1 protein in repeats I (IS1S2 and IS5S6), II (IIS5S6), and III (IIIS5S6). Insertion of a 9-residue hemagglutinin epitope in IS1S2, but not in IS5S6 or in IIS5S6, prevented the co-immunoprecipitation of CaV1.2 with CaVα2δ1. IS1S2 contains a cluster of three conserved negatively charged residues Glu-179, Asp-180, and Asp-181 that could contribute to non-bonded interactions with CaVα2δ1. Substitutions of CaV1.2 Asp-181 impaired the co-immunoprecipitation of CaVβ/CaV1.2 with CaVα2δ1 and the CaVα2δ1-dependent shift in voltage-dependent activation gating. In contrast, single substitutions in CaV1.2 in neighboring positions in the same loop (179, 180, and 182–184) did not significantly alter the functional up-regulation of CaV1.2 whole-cell currents. However, a negatively charged residue at position 180 was necessary to convey the CaVα2δ1-mediated shift in the activation gating. We also found a more modest contribution from the positively charged Arg-1119 in the extracellular pore region in repeat III of CaV1.2. We conclude that CaV1.2 Asp-181 anchors the physical interaction that facilitates the CaVα2δ1-mediated functional modulation of CaV1.2 currents. By stabilizing the first extracellular loop of CaV1.2, CaVα2δ1 may up-regulate currents by promoting conformations of the voltage sensor that are associated with the channel's open state. Voltage-gated L-type CaV1.2 channels in cardiomyocytes exist as heteromeric complexes. Co-expression of CaVα2δ1 with CaVβ/CaVα1 proteins reconstitutes the functional properties of native L-type currents, but the interacting domains at the CaV1.2/CaVα2δ1 interface are unknown. Here, a homology-based model of CaV1.2 identified protein interfaces between the extracellular domain of CaVα2δ1 and the extracellular loops of the CaVα1 protein in repeats I (IS1S2 and IS5S6), II (IIS5S6), and III (IIIS5S6). Insertion of a 9-residue hemagglutinin epitope in IS1S2, but not in IS5S6 or in IIS5S6, prevented the co-immunoprecipitation of CaV1.2 with CaVα2δ1. IS1S2 contains a cluster of three conserved negatively charged residues Glu-179, Asp-180, and Asp-181 that could contribute to non-bonded interactions with CaVα2δ1. Substitutions of CaV1.2 Asp-181 impaired the co-immunoprecipitation of CaVβ/CaV1.2 with CaVα2δ1 and the CaVα2δ1-dependent shift in voltage-dependent activation gating. In contrast, single substitutions in CaV1.2 in neighboring positions in the same loop (179, 180, and 182–184) did not significantly alter the functional up-regulation of CaV1.2 whole-cell currents. However, a negatively charged residue at position 180 was necessary to convey the CaVα2δ1-mediated shift in the activation gating. We also found a more modest contribution from the positively charged Arg-1119 in the extracellular pore region in repeat III of CaV1.2. We conclude that CaV1.2 Asp-181 anchors the physical interaction that facilitates the CaVα2δ1-mediated functional modulation of CaV1.2 currents. By stabilizing the first extracellular loop of CaV1.2, CaVα2δ1 may up-regulate currents by promoting conformations of the voltage sensor that are associated with the channel's open state. In cardiac cells, Ca2+ signals control the force necessary for the myocardium to meet the physiological needs of the body (1Bers D.M. Calcium fluxes involved in control of cardiac myocyte contraction.Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The primary pathway for Ca2+ influx in the adult heart is via the L-type Ca2+ channel. This Ca2+ influx pathway is essential for triggering sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and is the major source of Ca2+ load in this organelle (2Jaleel N. Nakayama H. Chen X. Kubo H. MacDonnell S.

The molecular determinants responsible for this modulation, and whether it involves a direct or an allosteric interaction, have yet to be identified.

In particular, the polar residues Asp-261, Ser-263, Ser-265, Thr-333, and Asp-365 in the rabbit CaVα2δ1 are forming the metal-ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), which are purported to play important roles at the protein interface. These CaVα2δ1 residues are facing residues in the extracellular loop linking the transmembrane helices S1 and S2 in the voltage sensor domain of repeat I (IS1S2) and the extracellular regions in the pore domains of repeats II and III (IIS5S6 and IIIS5S6, respectively), suggesting a broader interface than the highly localized α-interacting domain (AID) identified between CaV1.2 and CaVβ (15Van Petegem F.

In this work, we sought to identify the “hot spot AID” at the CaV1.2/CaVα2δ1 interface using a combination of protein chemistry, molecular modeling, and functional characterization of channel mutants. Structural alterations in the first extracellular loop in repeat I of CaV1.2, by the insertion of the 9-residue human influenza hemagglutinin (HA = YPYDVPDYA) epitope, impaired the up-regulation of CaV1.2 currents by CaVα2δ1 and significantly decreased the co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins. Single-point mutations of Asp-181 located within a conserved cluster of negatively charged residues (Glu-Asp-Asp or EDD) in the first extracellular loop of CaV1.2 prevented the modulation of whole-cell currents and the co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins. These data contrast with the modest impact of point mutations in the extracellular loop between the 5th and the 6th transmembrane helices in repeat III of CaV1.2. Altogether, our data are compatible with a model where negatively charged aspartate residues in IS1S2 of CaV1.2 anchor the interaction with CaVα2δ1. Functional regulation of CaV1.2 by CaVα2δ1 requires direct interaction between the two proteins (30Segura E. Bourdin B. Tétreault M.P. Briot J. Allen B.G. Mayer G. Parent L. Proteolytic cleavage of the hydrophobic domain in the CaVα2δ1 subunit improves assembly and activity of cardiac CaV1.2 channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 11109-11124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Surface mapping of the 3D structure obtained with the homologous skeletal muscle CaV1.1 suggests that the two proteins share a complex interaction network (Fig. 1). Four hot spots are readily identifiable. Some residues in the extracellular loops IS1S2, IS5S6, and IIS5S6 of CaV1.1 are located within atomic distance of residues in the VWA structural domain of CaVα2δ1, whereas residues in IIIS5S6 of CaV1.1 are closer to residues in the cache1 domain of CaVα2δ1. From the close examination of the 3D structure, any or all of these interfaces could be involved in the functional modulation of Ca2+ currents. Functional modulation of the activation gating and increase in the peak current density could arise from the low- or moderate-affinity binding to require interaction with one or more of these interfaces such that CaVα2δ1 could alternatively associate and dissociate from CaVβ-bound CaV1.2 proteins (31Voigt A. Freund R. Heck J. Missler M. Obermair G.J. Thomas U. Heine M. Dynamic association of calcium channel subunits at the cellular membrane.Neurophotonics. 2016; 3 (041809)Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine whether any or all of these extracellular loops confer functional interaction, we evaluated the functional impact of inserting an HA tag from the human influenza virus, in extracellular domains of CaV1.2. The HA tag was inserted after Ser-182 in IS1S2 (CaV1.2–HA Ser-182), after Glu-331 in IS5S6 (CaV1.2–HA Glu-331), and after Asp-710 in IIS5S6 (CaV1.2–HA Asp-710). All these constructs were translated at the expected molecular mass and expressed at the cell surface as confirmed by a flow cytometry assay (results not shown) (25Bourdin B. Shakeri B.

In all cases, co-expression of the complete set of subunits yielded high-voltage-activated Ca2+ currents. Co-expression of CaV1.2 WT with the mCherry–CaVα2δ1 WT construct enhanced whole-cell peak current densities by ≈7–10-fold from −2.5 ± 0.5 pA/pF (n = 25) (mock vector) to −15 ± 2 pA/pF (n = 23) in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+ (data not shown). Similar peak current densities of −18 ± 1 pA/pF (n = 243) were observed after co-expression with mCherry–CaVα2δ1–HA (Fig. 2B and Table 1). The increase in peak current density was associated with a ≈ −20-mV leftward shift in the activation potential of CaV1.2 (Fig. 2C) (25Bourdin B. Shakeri B. Tétreault M.P. Sauvé R. Lesage S. Parent L.

Co-expression of mCherry–CaVα2δ1–HA with CaV1.2–HA (Glu-331) or CaV1.2–HA (Asp-710) yielded similar results with activation and inactivation kinetics not significantly different from that recorded for CaV1.2 WT.

In contrast, introduction of the HA epitope or the bungarotoxin (BTX) epitope “WRYYESSLEPYPD” (33Sekine-Aizawa Y. Huganir R.L. Imaging of receptor trafficking by using α-bungarotoxin-binding-site-tagged receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The patch-clamp data suggest that the modification of the primary sequence in the first extracellular loop IS1S2 in CaV1.2 disrupts the interaction with CaVα2δ1. To evaluate whether the insertion of the HA epitope disturbed the physical interaction between the two proteins, co-immunoprecipitation assays were carried out using c-Myc-tagged CaVβ3 on anti-c-Myc-coated beads as bait (Fig. 3) (30Segura E.

HEKT cells were transiently transfected with pmCherry–CaVα2δ1–HA and pCMV–CaVβ3–c-Myc and either pCMV–CaV1.2 WT, pCMV–CaV1.2–HA (Ser-182), pCMV–CaV1.2–HA (Glu-331), or pCMV–CaV1.2–HA (Asp-710). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) overnight with anti-c-Myc magnetic beads to capture CaVβ3, eluted in a Laemmli buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE using 8% gels. A, immunoblotting was carried out on total proteins (20 μg) collected from the cell lysates for each of the three proteins (CaV1.2, CaVα2δ1, and CaVβ3) before the immunoprecipitation assay (Input) to confirm that each protein was translated at the expected molecular mass. Each experimental condition is identified by the specific CaV1.2 construct. The signal for the housekeeping protein GAPDH is shown below each blot. B, immunoblotting (IB) was carried out after eluting the protein complexes from the anti-c-Myc beads with anti-CaV1.2, anti-CaVα2δ1, and anti-CaVβ3 antibodies (from top to bottom, as indicated). Images for CaVα2δ1 were captured after short (1 s) or long exposure times (20 and 200 s). CaVβ3 and CaV1.2 proteins migrated at 60 and 250 kDa, respectively. All CaVα2δ1 proteins migrated at ≈175 kDa, which is consistent with the molecular mass of the mCherry–CaVα2δ1–HA in previous studies (30Segura E. Bourdin B. Tétreault M.P. Briot J. Allen B.G.

C, proteins that did not bind to the antibody-bead complex (referred to as the flow-through fraction) were collected, diluted in a Laemmli buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE using an 8% gel and revealed with the anti-CaVα2δ1. As seen, mCherry–CaVα2δ1–HA is present in the flow-through fraction at the expected molecular mass (175 kDa) confirming that the proteins were appropriately translated and were present in the preparation in detectable quantities throughout. These experiments were carried out three times with the mutants and 10 times for the WT construct over a period of 5 months and yielded qualitatively similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The three proteins (CaV1.2, CaVα2δ1, and CaVβ3) were detected at the expected molecular mass in the total cell lysates (“input lanes”) when either CaV1.2 WT, CaV1.2–HA (Ser-182), CaV1.2–HA (Glu-331), or CaV1.2–HA (Asp-710) was co-expressed with CaVβ3 and mCherry–CaVα2δ1–HA (Fig. 3A). Disruptions of the extracellular loops in CaV1.2 did not impair the strong interaction with CaVβ3, and immunoblotting of the proteins bound to the beads revealed robust signals for CaV1.2 even for CaV1.2–HA (Ser-182) (Fig. 3B). However, the signal for CaVα2δ1 that remained hooked onto the heteromeric complex was significantly weaker in the lysates prepared with CaV1.2–HA (Ser-182) than with any other CaV1.2 construct even after longer exposure times or after doubling the quantity of proteins loaded onto the anti-c-Myc-coated beads (data not shown). CaV1.2–HA (Ser-182) was nonetheless clearly present in the flow-through (Fig. 3C) fraction. Altogether, these data indicate that disrupting the first extracellular loop IS1S2 in CaV1.2 prevents the functional interaction with CaVα2δ1 and suggest that the IS1S2 extracellular loop contains the elements that are important for carrying the physical interaction between the two proteins. The insertion of a 9-residue epitope after Ser-182 in the 17-residue IS1S2 extracellular loop prevented the optimal interaction with CaVα2δ1 by directly modifying the interaction site or indirectly from a nonspecific alteration of the secondary structure that was propagated to the actual interaction site. To narrow down the residues from CaV1.2 that are potentially interacting with CaVα2δ1, we run the bioinformatics tool PDBePISA (34Paxman J.J. Heras B."

Here we report a new voltage sensitive fluorescent indicator which response could be detected by fluorescence monitoring in a single red channel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fluorescent protein-based voltage sensor which uses insertion-into-circular permutant topology to provide an efficient interaction between sensitive and reporter domains. Its fluorescent core originates from red fluorescent protein (FP) FusionRed, which has optimal spectral characteristics to be used in whole body imaging techniques. Indicators using the same domain topology could become a new perspective for the FP-based voltage sensors that are traditionally based on Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)."
https://openalex.org/W2751364678,"N-terminal histone tails are subject to many posttranslational modifications that are recognized by and interact with designated reader domains in histone-binding proteins. BROMO domain adjacent to zinc finger 2B (BAZ2B) is a multidomain histone-binding protein that contains two histone reader modules, a plant homeodomain (PHD) and a bromodomain (BRD), linked by a largely disordered linker. Although previous studies have reported specificity of the PHD domain for the unmodified N terminus of histone H3 and of the BRD domain for H3 acetylated at Lys14 (H3K14ac), the exact mode of H3 binding by BAZ2B and its regulation are underexplored. Here, using isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy, we report that acidic residues in the BAZ2B PHD domain are essential for H3 binding and that BAZ2B PHD-BRD establishes a polyvalent interaction with H3K14ac. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the disordered interdomain linker modulates the histone-binding affinity by interacting with the PHD domain. In particular, lysine-rich stretches in the linker, which resemble the positively charged N terminus of histone H3, reduce the binding affinity of the PHD finger toward the histone substrate. Phosphorylation, acetylation, or poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the linker residues may therefore act as a cellular mechanism to transiently tune BAZ2B histone-binding affinity. Our findings further support the concept of interdomain linkers serving a dual role in substrate binding by appropriately positioning the adjacent domains and by electrostatically modulating substrate binding. Moreover, inhibition of histone binding by a histone-mimicking interdomain linker represents another example of regulation of protein-protein interactions by intramolecular mimicry."
https://openalex.org/W2751068853,"With about 3.4 million HIV-infected persons, Nigeria has the second highest number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in the world. However, antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage in Nigeria remains low with only 748,846 (22%) of PLHIV on ART by the end of 2014. Retention of HIV-infected patients in pre-ART care is essential to ensure timely ART initiation. We assessed outcomes of patients enrolled in Nigeria's pre-ART program during 2004-2012.We conducted a nationally representative retrospective cohort study among adults (≥15 years old), enrolling in pre-ART programs supported by the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Nigeria. A total of 35 sites enrolling ≥50 patients in pre-ART were selected using probability proportional-to-size sampling; 2,415 eligible medical records at these sites were randomly selected for abstraction. Determinants of loss to follow-up (LTFU) and mortality during pre-ART care were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.The median age at enrollment was 32 years (interquartile range (IQR) 27-40). A total of 1,216 (51.4%) initiated ART by the time of data abstraction. Among the remaining 1,199 patients, 898 (74.9%) had been LTFU, 180 (15.0%) were alive and in pre-ART care, 71 (5.9%) had died, 50 (4.2%) had transferred out or stopped care. Baseline markers of advanced disease, including weight <45 kg (adjusted hazard ration (AHR) = 4.23; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.51-15.58) and more advanced WHO disease stage, were predictive of pre-ART mortality. Compared with patients aged 15-24, patients aged 35-44 (AHR = 0.67; 95% CI: 1.0.47-0.95) and age 45-54 (AHR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.48-0.91) had lower LTFU rates. Compared with attending facilities in North Central geopolitical zone, attending facility locations in South East (AHR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.24-0.83) was protective against LTFU.About half of patients enrolling in HIV program during 2004-2012 in Nigeria had not initiated ART by 2013. Key strategies to improve early ART initiation among pre-ART enrollees include implementation of the WHO test and treat guidelines, earlier HIV testing, and better monitoring to improve ART initiation rates. Further research to understand regional variations in pre-ART outcomes is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2751405914,"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of Johne’s disease (JD), a chronic intestinal inflammatory disease of cattle and other ruminants. JD has a high herd prevalence and causes serious animal health problems and significant economic loss in domesticated ruminants throughout the world. Since serological detection of MAP infected animals during the early stages of infection remains challenging due to the low sensitivity of extant assays, we screened 180 well-characterized serum samples using a whole proteome microarray from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), a close relative of MAP. Based on extensive testing of serum and milk samples, fecal culture and qPCR for direct detection of MAP, the samples were previously assigned to one of 4 groups: negative low exposure (n = 30, NL); negative high exposure (n = 30, NH); fecal positive, ELISA negative (n = 60, F+E-); and fecal positive, ELISA positive (n = 60, F+E+). Of the 740 reactive proteins, several antigens were serologically recognized early but not late in infection, suggesting a complex and dynamic evolution of the MAP humoral immune response during disease progression. Ordinal logistic regression models identified a subset of 47 candidate proteins with significantly different normalized intensity values (p<0.05), including 12 in the NH and 23 in F+E- groups, suggesting potential utility for the early detection of MAP infected animals. Next, the diagnostic utility of four MAP orthologs (MAP1569, MAP2942c, MAP2609, and MAP1272c) was assessed and reveal moderate to high diagnostic sensitivities (range 48.3% to 76.7%) and specificity (range 96.7% to 100%), with a combined 88.3% sensitivity and 96.7% specificity. Taken together, the results of our analyses have identified several candidate MAP proteins of potential utility for the early detection of MAP infection, as well individual MAP proteins that may serve as the foundation for the next generation of well-defined serological diagnosis of JD in cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2753665850,"Chemokine-induced directional cell migration is a universal cellular mechanism and plays crucial roles in numerous biological processes, including embryonic development, immune system function, and tissue remodeling and regeneration. During the migration of a stationary cell, the cell polarizes, forms lamellipodia at the leading edge (LE), and triggers the concurrent retraction of the trailing edge (TE). During cell migration governed by inhibitory G protein (Gi)-coupled receptors (GPCRs), G protein βγ (Gβγ) subunits control the LE signaling. Interestingly, TE retraction has been linked to the activation of the small GTPase Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) by the Gα12/13 pathway. However, it is not clear how the activation of Gi-coupled GPCRs at the LE orchestrates the TE retraction in RAW264.7 macrophages. Here, using an optogenetic approach involving an opsin to activate the Gi pathway in defined subcellular regions of RAW cells, we show that in addition to their LE activities, free Gβγ subunits also govern TE retraction by operating two independent, yet synchronized, pathways. The first pathway involves RhoA activation, which prevents dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain, allowing actomyosin contractility to proceed. The second pathway activates phospholipase Cβ and induces myosin light chain phosphorylation to enhance actomyosin contractility through increasing cytosolic calcium. We further show that both of these pathways are essential, and inhibition of either one is sufficient to abolish the Gi-coupled GPCR-governed TE retraction and subsequent migration of RAW cells."
https://openalex.org/W2752658859,"Choroidal melanoma is the most common primary malignant intraocular tumor, and very few effective therapies are available to treat it. Our study aimed to understand whether pemetrexed plus cisplatin exerts a beneficial synergistic effect in human choroidal melanoma cells and to delineate the underlying molecular mechanism. To accomplish these aims, we treated choroidal melanoma cells with pemetrexed and cisplatin and assessed cell survival with SRB and MTT assays. Proteins were detected using western blotting analysis. NOXA and CHOP were knocked down with siRNA. We found that pemetrexed or cisplatin alone inhibited survival and induced apoptosis in human choroidal melanoma cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of c-FLIP, an anti-apoptotic protein in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, and Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, were decreased by pemetrexed or cisplatin respectively, while the expression of a pro-apoptotic protein in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, NOXA, was up-regulated. Moreover, pemetrexed or cisplatin alone increased the protein expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress markers IRE1α, Bip and CHOP. Silencing CHOP expression reduced NOXA expression. These findings suggest that the pemetrexed or cisplatin induced intrinsic apoptosis via activation of the ER stress response. Importantly, combining the two compounds more strongly induced apoptosis. Following the cotreatment, CHOP and NOXA expression increased, while c-FLIP and Mcl-1 expression decreased, and these effects were more pronounced than when using either compound alone. This result suggests that pemetrexed and cisplatin synergistically activate ER stress response-induced apoptosis in choroidal melanoma cells. To summarize, the c-FLIP and NOXA/Mcl-1 axis participated in the synergistic effect of pemetrexed plus cisplatin in human choroidal melanoma cells. Intrinsic apoptosis was induced via activation of the ER stress response. Our study provides important mechanistic insights into potential cancer treatment with pemetrexed plus cisplatin and enriches our understanding of human choroidal melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2752917308,"Cardiovascular incidences are markedly higher in men than in pre-menstrual women. However, this advantage in women declines with aging and therefore can be correlated with the sex hormone 17β-Estradiol (E2) which is reported to protect heart cells by acting though estrogen receptors (ERs). In this study we have determined the effect of E2/ERβ against ISO induced cellular hypertrophy in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells. The results confirm that ISO induced cardiac-hypertrophy by elevating the levels of hypertrophy associated proteins, ANP and BNP and further by upregulating p-CaMKII, calcineurin, p-GATA4 and NFATc3 which was correlated with a significant enlargement of the H9c2 cardiomyoblast. However, overexpression of ERβ and/or administration of E2 inhibited ISO-induced hypertrophy in H9c2 cells. In addition, E2/ERβ also inhibited ISO-induced NFATc3 translocation, and reduced the protein level of downstream marker, BNP. Furthermore, by testing with the calcineurin inhibitor (CsA), it was confirmed that calcineurin acted as a key mediator for the anti-hypertrophic effect of E2/ERβ. In cells treated with calcium blocker (BATPA), the inhibitory effect of E2/ERβ on ISO-induced Ca2+ influx and hypertrophic effects were totally blocked suggesting that E2/ERβ inhibited calcineurin activity to activate I-1 protein and suppress PP1, then induce PLB protein phosphorylation and activation, resulting in Ca2+ reuptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum through SR Ca2+ cycling modification. In conclusion, E2/ERβ suppresses the Ca2+ influx and calcineurin activity induced by ISO to enhance the PLB protein activity and SR Ca2+ cycling."

The meat quality and growth rates of local chickens and commercial broilers are very different. The Ribo-Zero RNA-Seq technology is an effective means of analyzing transcript groups to clarify molecular mechanisms. The aim of this study was to provide a reference for studies of the differences in the meat quality and growth of different breeds of chickens.Ribo-Zero RNA-Seq technology was used to analyze the pectoral muscle transcriptomes of Gushi chickens and AA broilers. Compared with AA broilers, 1649 genes with annotated information were significantly differentially expressed (736 upregulated and 913 downregulated) in Gushi chickens with Q≤0.05 (Q is the P-value corrected by multiple assumptions test) at a fold change ≥2 or ≤0.5. In addition, 2540 novel significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes (1405 upregulated and 1135 downregulated) were discovered. The results showed that the main signal transduction pathways that differed between Gushi chickens and AA broilers were related to amino acid metabolism. Amino acids are important for protein synthesis, and they regulate key metabolic pathways to improve the growth, development and reproduction of organisms.This study showed that differentially expressed genes in the pectoral tissues of Gushi chickens and AA broilers were related to fat metabolism, which affects meat. Additionally, a large number of novel genes were found that may be involved in fat metabolism and thus may affect the formation of meat, which requires further study.

https://openalex.org/W2751428071,"Inappropriate repair responses to pulmonary epithelial injury have been linked to perturbation of epithelial barrier function and airway remodelling in a number of respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We developed an in vitro mechanical scratch injury model in air-liquid interface differentiated primary human small airway epithelial cells that recapitulates many of the characteristics observed during epithelial wound injury in both human tissue and small animal models. Wound closure was initially associated with de-differentiation of the differentiated apical cells and rapid migration into the wound site, followed by proliferation of apical cells behind the wound edge, together with increases in FAK expression, fibronectin and reduction in PAI-1 which collectively facilitate cell motility and extracellular matrix deposition. Macrophages are intimately involved in wound repair so we sought to investigate the role of macrophage sub-types on this process in a novel primary human co-culture model. M1 macrophages promoted FAK expression and both M1 and M2 macrophages promoted epithelial de-differentiation. Interestingly, M2a macrophages inhibited both proliferation and fibronectin expression, possibly via the retinoic acid pathway, whereas M2b and M2c macrophages prevented fibronectin deposition, possibly via MMP expression. Collectively these data highlight the complex nature of epithelial wound closure, the differential impact of macrophage sub-types on this process, and the heterogenic and non-delineated function of these macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2751547438,"To explore the cardiac electrophysiological characteristics of cardiac hypertrophy and its influence on the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.Adult C57BL6 mice were randomly divided into a surgery group and a control group. Thoracic aortic constriction was performed on mice in the surgery group, and cardiac anatomical and ultrasonic evaluations were performed to confirm the success of the cardiac hypertrophy model 4 weeks after the operation. Using the Langendorff method of isolated heart perfusion, monophasic action potentials (MAPs) and the effective refractory period (ERP) at different parts of the heart (including the epi- and endo-myocardium of the left and right ventricles) were measured, and the induction rate of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was observed under programmed electrical stimulus (PES) and burst stimulus. Whole-cell patch-clamp was used to obtain the I-V characteristics of voltage-gated potassium channels in cardiomyocytes of different parts of the heart (including the epi- and endo-myocardium of the left and right ventricles) as well as the channels' properties of steady-state inactivation and recovery from inactivation.The ratio of heart weight to body weight and the ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight in the surgery group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Ultrasonic evaluation revealed that both interventricular septal diameter (IVSD) and left ventricle posterior wall diameter (LVPWD) in the surgery group were significantly larger than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Under PES and burst stimuli, the induction rates of arrhythmias in the surgery group significantly increased, reaching 41.2% and 23.5%, respectively. Both the QT interval and action potential duration (APD) in the surgery group were significantly longer than in the control group (P<0.01), and the changes showed obvious spatial heterogeneity. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that the surgery group had significantly lower potassium current densities (IPeak, Ito, IKur, Iss, and IK1) at different parts of the heart than the control group (P < 0.01), and there were significant differences in the half-inactivation voltage (V1/2) and the inactivation-recovery time constant (τ) of Ito and IKur at different parts of the heart (P < 0.01) between the surgery group and the control group. In addition, the surgery group had significantly lower densities of IPeak, Ito, and IKur in cells of the endo-myocardium (P < 0.05), and the changes showed obvious spatial heterogeneity.Changes in the current density and function of potassium channels contributed to irregular repolarization in cardiac hypertrophy, and the spatially heterogeneous changes of the channels may increase the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias that accompany cardiac hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2752015986,"Purpose 
Mutations in BRCA1 are associated with familial as well as sporadic aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, but less is known about whether BRCA1 expression or subcellular localization contributes to progression in population-based settings.


Methods 
We examined BRCA1 expression and subcellular localization in invasive breast cancer tissues from an ethnically diverse sample of 286 patients and 36 normal breast tissue controls. Two different methods were used to label breast cancer tissues for BRCA1: (1) Dual immunofluoresent staining with BRCA1 and cytokeratin 8/18 and (2) immunohistochemical staining using the previously validated MS110 mouse monoclonal antibody. Slides were visualized and quantified using the VECTRA Automated Multispectral Image Analysis System and InForm software.


Results 
BRCA1 staining was more intense in normal than in invasive breast tissue for both cytoplasmic (p<0.0001) and nuclear (p<0.01) compartments. BRCA1 nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio was higher in breast cancer cells than in normal mammary epithelial cells. Reduced BRCA1 expression was associated with high tumor grade and negative hormone receptors (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her2). On the other hand, high BRCA1 expression correlated with basal-like tumors (high CK5/6 and EGFR), and high nuclear androgen receptor staining. Lower nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of BRCA1 correlated significantly with high Ki67 labeling index (p< 0.05) and family history of breast cancer (p = 0.001).


Conclusion 
Findings of this study indicate that alterations in BRCA1 protein expression and subcellular localization in breast cancer correlate with poor prognostic markers and aggressive tumor features. Further large-scale studies are required to assess the potential relevance of BRCA1 protein expression and localization in routine classification of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2753777254,"Alpha-synuclein (aS) amyloid formation is involved in Parkinson’s disease (PD); therefore, small molecules that target aS and affect its aggregation are of interest as future drug candidates. We recently reported modified ring-fused 2-pyridones that modulate aS amyloid formation in vitro. Here, we describe the effects of such molecules on behavioral parameters of a Drosophila model of PD (i.e., flies expressing human aS), using a new approach (implemented in a commercially available FlyTracker system) to quantify fly mobility. FlyTracker allows for automated analysis of walking and climbing locomotor behavior, as it collects large sequences of data over time in an unbiased manner. We found that the molecules per se have no toxic or kinetic effects on normal flies. Feeding aS-expressing flies with the amyloid-promoting molecule FN075, remarkably, resulted in increased fly mobility at early time points; however, this effect switched to reduced mobility at later time points, and flies had shorter life spans than controls. In contrast, an amyloid inhibitor increased both fly kinetics and life span. In agreement with increased aS amyloid formation, the FN075-fed flies had less soluble aS, and in vitro aS-FN075 interactions stimulated aS amyloid formation. In addition to a new quantitative approach to probe mobility (available in FlyTracker), our results imply that aS regulates brain activity such that initial removal (here, by FN075-triggered assembly of aS) allows for increased fly mobility."
https://openalex.org/W2751387818,"Benchmarking surveillance systems requires realistic simulations of disease outbreaks. However, obtaining these data in sufficient quantity, with a realistic shape and covering a sufficient range of agents, size and duration, is known to be very difficult. The dataset of outbreak signals generated should reflect the likely distribution of authentic situations faced by the surveillance system, including very unlikely outbreak signals. We propose and evaluate a new approach based on the use of historical outbreak data to simulate tailored outbreak signals. The method relies on a homothetic transformation of the historical distribution followed by resampling processes (Binomial, Inverse Transform Sampling Method—ITSM, Metropolis-Hasting Random Walk, Metropolis-Hasting Independent, Gibbs Sampler, Hybrid Gibbs Sampler). We carried out an analysis to identify the most important input parameters for simulation quality and to evaluate performance for each of the resampling algorithms. Our analysis confirms the influence of the type of algorithm used and simulation parameters (i.e. days, number of cases, outbreak shape, overall scale factor) on the results. We show that, regardless of the outbreaks, algorithms and metrics chosen for the evaluation, simulation quality decreased with the increase in the number of days simulated and increased with the number of cases simulated. Simulating outbreaks with fewer cases than days of duration (i.e. overall scale factor less than 1) resulted in an important loss of information during the simulation. We found that Gibbs sampling with a shrinkage procedure provides a good balance between accuracy and data dependency. If dependency is of little importance, binomial and ITSM methods are accurate. Given the constraint of keeping the simulation within a range of plausible epidemiological curves faced by the surveillance system, our study confirms that our approach can be used to generate a large spectrum of outbreak signals."
https://openalex.org/W2750942295,"Antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) are found in 14-44% of patients with HIV infection, but it is still unclear whether hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination should be recommended for HIV-positive subjects with isolated anti-HBc (IAHBc). We examined the rate of anamnestic and primary responses (ARs and PRs) and associated factors in a group of HIV-infected patients with an IAHBc profile.This prospective study recruited 25 HIV-positive patients with anti-HBc alone who were vaccinated against HBV infection. Those without an AR (anti-hepatitis B envelope antigen [anti-HBs] levels of <10 U/L) or who were hypo-responsiveness (anti-HBs levels of >10 but <100 U/L) four weeks after the first dose of vaccine underwent a full course of vaccinations. Their clinical and virological data, including the presence of occult hepatitis B infection (OBI), were evaluated in accordance with the vaccination schedule.Six of the 25 patients (24%) showed an AR, four of whom had anti-HBs levels of <100 U/L. Ten of 19 (52.6%) remaining patients became seroprotected after the third dose. OBI was detected in four of the six patients with an AR, two of the 10 patients with a PR, and none of the nine patients who did not respond. Multivariate analysis showed that an AR was associated with the presence of OBI (P = 0.0162), and a PR was associated with HCV antibody status. (P = 0.0191).Our data suggest that testing for anti-HBc alone may not be a reliable means of assessing protection from HBV infection in HIV-positive patients. OBI-positive patients may benefit from a single vaccine dose. Anti-HCV serostatus may affect PRs."
https://openalex.org/W2750613878,"Carcasses of wild animals are often visited by different scavengers. However, determining which scavenger caused certain types of bite marks is particularly difficult and knowledge thereof is lacking. Therefore, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay (target sequence cytochrome b) was developed to detect red fox DNA in carcasses of harbour porpoises. The MSwab™ method for direct testing without prior DNA isolation was validated. As a detection device, the portable real-time fluorometer Genie® II was used, which yields rapid results and can be used in field studies without huge laboratory equipment. In addition to in vitro evaluation and validation, a stranded and scavenged harbour porpoise carcass was successfully examined for red fox DNA residues. The developed LAMP method is a valuable diagnostic tool for confirming presumable red fox bite wounds in harbour porpoises without further DNA isolation steps."
https://openalex.org/W2750935316,"Grade variation on interstate highways affects the roadway geometric design, vehicle performance and driver behavior, thus possibly exerting an unexpected effect on vehicular speed. Hence, determining the internal relationship between grade and speed is important and useful for drivers, traffic regulators and other traffic participants. However, the problem with performing this research is the lack of large-scale gradient and speed data. Google Earth (GE) provides an application programming interface for extracting elevation data worldwide. The elevation dataset from GE can be easily converted to grade data. In addition, our team has collected and stored speed series data for different freeways over several years. Based on the above obtainable grade and speed datasets, we conducted research on the effect of grades on free flow speeds from two perspectives. First, the influence of grades on speed was analyzed from both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The analysis of the distributions of four typical types of speeds demonstrated a decreasing tendency as the speed increased. Steeper grades generated a more intense speed fluctuation in terms of the four types of speeds. Second, a model based on the Student’s t-test was developed to evaluate the level of significant difference among speed series under neighboring grades. The Student’s t-test demonstrated that adjacent grades do not significantly influence the speeds. In summary, speeds under different grades showed obviously different tendencies. The findings of this study can help transport authorities set more reasonable speed limits and improve the geometric design of interstates with grade variation constraints."
https://openalex.org/W2753347497,"DNA polymerases are present in all organisms and are important enzymes that synthesise DNA molecules. They are used in various fields of science, predominantly as essential components for in vitro DNA syntheses, known as PCR. Modern diagnostics, molecular biology and genetic engineering need DNA polymerases which demonstrate improved performance. This study was aimed at obtaining a new NeqSSB-TaqS fusion DNA polymerase from the Taq DNA Stoffel domain and a single-stranded DNA binding-like protein of Nanoarchaeum equitans in order to significantly improve the properties of DNA polymerase. The DNA coding sequence of Taq Stoffel DNA polymerase and the nonspecific DNA-binding protein of Nanoarchaeum equitans (NeqSSB-like protein) were fused. A novel recombinant gene was obtained which was cloned into the pET-30 Ek/LIC vector and introduced into E. coli for expression. The recombinant enzyme was purified and its enzymatic properties including DNA polymerase activity, PCR amplification rate, thermostability, processivity and resistance to inhibitors, were tested. The yield of the target protein reached approximately 18 mg/l after 24 h of the IPTG induction. The specific activity of the polymerase was 2200 U/mg. The recombinant NeqSSB-TaqS exhibited a much higher extension rate (1000 bp template in 20 s), processivity (19 nt), thermostability (half-life 35 min at 95°C) and higher tolerance to PCR inhibitors (0.3-1.25% of whole blood, 0.84-13.5 μg of lactoferrin and 4.7-150 ng of heparin) than Taq Stoffel DNA polymerase. Furthermore, our studies show that NeqSSB-TaqS DNA polymerase has a high level of flexibility in relation to Mg2+ ions (from 1 to 5 mM) and KCl or (NH4)2SO4 salts (more than 60 mM and 40 mM, respectively). Using NeqSSB-TaqS DNA polymerase instead of the Taq DNA polymerase could be a better choice in many PCR applications."
https://openalex.org/W2751881426,"Autonomous audio recording is stimulating new field in bioacoustics, with a great promise for conducting cost-effective species surveys. One major current challenge is the lack of reliable classifiers capable of multi-species identification. We present PROTAX-Sound, a statistical framework to perform probabilistic classification of animal sounds. PROTAX-Sound is based on a multinomial regression model, and it can utilize as predictors any kind of sound features or classifications produced by other existing algorithms. PROTAX-Sound combines audio and image processing techniques to scan environmental audio files. It identifies regions of interest (a segment of the audio file that contains a vocalization to be classified), extracts acoustic features from them and compares with samples in a reference database. The output of PROTAX-Sound is the probabilistic classification of each vocalization, including the possibility that it represents species not present in the reference database. We demonstrate the performance of PROTAX-Sound by classifying audio from a species-rich case study of tropical birds. The best performing classifier achieved 68% classification accuracy for 200 bird species. PROTAX-Sound improves the classification power of current techniques by combining information from multiple classifiers in a manner that yields calibrated classification probabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2751907129,"Background Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported identifiable disease in the United States (U.S.). Importantly, more than 25% of gonorrheal infections demonstrate antibiotic resistance, leading the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to classify gonorrhea as an “urgent threat”. Methods We examined the association of gonorrhea infection rates with the incidence of HIV and socioeconomic factors. A county-level multivariable model was then constructed. Results Multivariable analysis demonstrated that HIV incidence [Coefficient (Coeff): 1.26, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.86, 1.66, P<0.001] exhibited the most powerful independent association with the incidence of gonorrhea and predicted 40% of the observed variation in gonorrhea infection rates. Sociodemographic factors like county urban ranking (Coeff: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.20, P = 0.005), percentage of women (Coeff: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.53, P<0.001) and percentage of individuals under the poverty line (Coeff: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.57, P<0.001) exerted a secondary impact. A regression model that incorporated these variables predicted 56% of the observed variation in gonorrhea incidence (Pmodel<0.001, R2 model = 0.56). Conclusions Gonorrhea and HIV infection exhibited a powerful correlation thus emphasizing the benefits of comprehensive screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and the value of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV among patients visiting an STI clinic. Furthermore, sociodemographic factors also impacted gonorrhea incidence, thus suggesting another possible focus for public health initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W2750876947,"The source of HCV transmission in Saudi Arabia is unknown. This study aimed to determine HCV genotypes in a representative sample of chronically infected patients in Saudi Arabia. All HCV isolates were genotyped and subtyped by sequencing of the HCV core region and 54 new HCV isolates were identified. Three sets of primers targeting the core region were used for both amplification and sequencing of all isolates resulting in a 326 bp fragment. Most HCV isolates were genotype 4 (85%), whereas only a few isolates were recognized as genotype 1 (15%). With the assistance of Genbank database and BLAST, subtyping results showed that most of genotype 4 isolates were 4d whereas most of genotype 1 isolates were 1b. Nucleotide conservation and variation rates of HCV core sequences showed that 4a and 1b have the highest levels of variation. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences by Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Coalescent methods was used to explore the source of HCV transmission by investigating the relationship between Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Middle East and Africa. Coalescent analysis showed that transmissions of HCV from Egypt to Saudi Arabia are estimated to have occurred in three major clusters: 4d was introduced into the country before 1900, the major 4a clade's MRCA was introduced between 1900 and 1920, and the remaining lineages were introduced between 1940 and 1960 from Egypt and Middle Africa. Results showed that no lineages seem to have crossed from Egypt to Saudi Arabia in the last 15 years. Finally, sequencing and characterization of new HCV isolates from Saudi Arabia will enrich the HCV database and help further studies related to treatment and management of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2753249017,"Fourteen-day rehospitalization with new traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) diagnosis is used as an indicator for the diagnostic quality of the first hospitalization. In this nationwide population-based cohort study, we identified risk factors for this indicator.We conducted a nested case-control study by using the data of patients who received a first hospitalization for trauma between 2001 and 2011. The data were retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Variables including demographic and trauma characteristics were compared between patients diagnosed with tSCI at the first hospitalization and those receiving a 14-day rehospitalization with new tSCI diagnosis.Of the 23 617 tSCI patients, 997 had 14-day rehospitalization with new tSCI diagnosis (incidence rate, 4.22%). The risk of 14-day rehospitalization with new tSCI diagnosis was significantly lower in patients with severe (injury severity score [ISS] = 16-24; odds ratio [OR], 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.21) and profound (ISS > 24; OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.07-0.18) injuries. Interhospital transfer (OR, 8.20; 95% CI, 6.48-10.38) was a significant risk factor, along with injuries at the thoracic (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.21-2.18), lumbar (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.02-1.65), and multiple (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.86-5.61) levels. Brain (OR, 2.82), chest (OR, 2.99), and abdominal (OR, 2.74) injuries were also identified as risk factors. In addition, the risk was higher in patients treated at the orthopedic department (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.78-2.87) and those of other surgical disciplines (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.57-2.28) than in those treated at the neurosurgery department.Delayed tSCI diagnoses are not uncommon, particularly among trauma patients with ISSs < 16 or those who are transferred from lower-level hospitals. Further validation and implementation of evidence-based decision rules is essential for improving the diagnostic quality of traumatic thoracolumbar SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2753455528,"Human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection is a leading global health problem that causes approximately one million deaths each year. Although antiretroviral therapy can slow down the disease progression and improve the quality of life of infected individuals, it cannot eradicate the virus. A successful vaccine is one of the most cost-effective alternatives to control the incidence and mortality of HIV infection. CD4+ T cells play a key role in orchestrating other forms of human immune responses, therefore, an HIV vaccine that includes a component capable of eliciting CD4+ T cell responses is highly desirable. To this end, we have previously designed a polypeptide vaccine comprised of multiple CD4+ T cell epitopes. In the current study, we tested the immunogenicity of this vaccine in mouse models by using IFN-γELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining assays. We found that several epitopes in this vaccine elicited CD4+ T cell immune responses in both congenic mice and human HLA-A2/DRB1 transgenic mice. These new epitopes may be further tested for their ability to augment immune responses elicited by other forms of HIV vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2750628608,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep disordered breathing and has been associated with major cardiovascular comorbidities. We hypothesized that the microcirculation is impaired in patients with OSA and that the magnitude of impairment correlates to OSA severity.Subjects were consecutive patients scheduled for routine diagnostic polysomnography (PSG). OSA was defined by paradoxical rib cage movements together with abdominal excursions and by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (events/hour; no apnea AHI<5; mild apnea 5≤AHI<15; moderate apnea 15≤AHI<30; severe apnea AHI ≥30). Sidestream darkfield imaging was used to assess the sublingual microcirculation. Recordings of sublingual microcirculation (5 random sites) were performed before and after overnight PSG. Data are summarized as mean (±SD); p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.Thirty-three consecutive patients were included. OSA was diagnosed in 16 subjects (4 moderate, 12 severe). There was no significant difference in microcirculation between subjects with moderate OSA and without OSA. However, compared to subjects without OSA, subjects with severe OSA (AHI≥30) showed a significant decrease of microvascular flow index (-0.07±0.17 vs. 0.08±0.14; p = 0.02) and increase of microvascular flow index heterogeneity (0.06±0.15 vs. -0.06±0.11; p = 0.02) overnight. Multiple regression analysis (adjusted for age and gender) showed both decrease of flow and increase of flow heterogeneity associated with AHI (b = -0.41; F = 1.8; p = 0.04 and b = 0.43; F = 1.9; p = 0.03, respectively).Acute overnight microcirculatory changes are observed in subjects with severe OSA characterized by decreased flow and increased flow heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W2750765231,"We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the heart block with electron compensation (HBE) technique, based on three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in left-sided breast cancer patients with underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease.Twenty patients with left-sided breast cancer who were treated with whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) were included in this study. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), 3D-CRT, and HBE treatment plans were generated for each patient. Based on the 3D-CRT plan, the HBE plan included a heart block from the medial tangential field to shield the heart and added an electron beam to compensate for the loss in target volume coverage. The dosimetric parameters for the heart and lung and the target volume between the three treatment types were compared.Of the three plans, the HBE plan yielded the most significant reduction in the doses received by the heart and lung (heart Dmean: 5.1 Gy vs. 12.9 Gy vs. 4.0 Gy and lung Dmean: 11.4 Gy vs. 13.2 Gy vs. 10.5 Gy, for 3D-CRT, IMRT, and HBE, respectively). Target coverage with all three techniques was within the acceptable range (Dmean 51.0 Gy vs. 51.2 Gy vs. 50.6 Gy, for 3D-CRT, IMRT, and HBE, respectively).The HBE plan effectively reduced the amount of radiation exposure to the heart and lung. It could be beneficial for patients who are vulnerable to radiation-related cardiac or pulmonary toxicities."
https://openalex.org/W2751707030,"Following the production of western gray wolf (Canis lupus) x western coyote (Canis latrans) hybrids via artificial insemination (AI), the present article documents that the hybrids survived in captivity for at least 4 years and successfully bred with each other. It further reports that backcrossing one of the hybrids to a male gray wolf by AI also resulted in the birth of live pups that have survived for at least 10 months. All male hybrids (F1 and F2) produced sperm by about 10 months of age, and sperm quality of the F1 males fell within the fertile range for domestic dogs, but sperm motility and morphology, in particular, were low in F2 males at 10 months but improved in samples taken at 22 months of age. These studies are relevant to a long-standing controversy about the identity of the red wolf (Canis rufus), the existence of a proposed new species (Canis lycaon) of gray wolf, and to the role of hybridization in mammalian evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2752586396,"Aimed at the complicated problems of attraction characteristics regarding passenger flow in urban rail transit network, the concept of the gravity field of passenger flow is proposed in this paper. We establish the computation methods of field strength and potential energy to reveal the potential attraction relationship among stations from the perspective of the collection and distribution of passenger flow and the topology of network. As for the computation methods of field strength, an optimum path concept is proposed to define betweenness centrality parameter. Regarding the computation of potential energy, Compound Simpson’s Rule Formula is applied to get a solution to the function. Taking No. 10 Beijing Subway as a practical example, an analysis of simulation and verification is conducted, and the results shows in the following ways. Firstly, the bigger field strength value between two stations is, the stronger passenger flow attraction is, and the greater probability of the formation of the largest passenger flow of section is. Secondly, there is the greatest passenger flow volume and circulation capacity between two zones of high potential energy."

It has been responsible for causing considerable economic damage to water chestnut (Trapa natans) plants. In the Changsha vicinity of China, P. crisonalis has five generations a year. Populations of P. crisonalis were relatively low in April and began to rapidly rise at the beginning of May. At the end of July and early August, the population dropped dramatically. A rebound occurred at the end of August and early September, which was referred to as the second population peak. From then, until early November, the P. crisonalis population steadily diminished in preparation for overwintering. The primary factors influencing the seasonal dynamics of P. crisonalis were the climatic conditions, especially the temperature, and secondarily precipitation. Between May and October, the P. crisonalis adults were evenly distributed in the pond. In May and June, the eggs of P. crisonalis were present in an aggregate distribution, due to the effects of environmental heterogeneity. In July and August, however, they were found to be in a uniform distribution."

In this paper, we test whether these findings generalize to a more diverse and representative sample. The major findings from past work were replicated in the current study. When presented with several potential reasons for IP protection, the lay public endorsed plagiarism and felt that acknowledging the original source of a creative work should make copying that work permissible-viewpoints strongly divergent from lawmakers' intent and the law itself. In addition, we replicate the finding that lay people know remarkably little about intellectual property laws more generally and report little experience as users or creators of creative works."
