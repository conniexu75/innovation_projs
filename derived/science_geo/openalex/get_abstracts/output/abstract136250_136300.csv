The current concept is that these processes are of distinct biophysical nature. Here we report the expression cloning of a liver cDNA encoding a unique promiscuous solute channel (AQP9) that confers high permeability for both solutes and water. AQP9 mediates passage of a wide variety of non-charged solutes including carbamides, polyols, purines, and pyrimidines in a phloretin- and mercury-sensitive manner, whereas amino acids, cyclic sugars, Na+, K+, Cl−, and deprotonated monocarboxylates are excluded. The properties of AQP9 define a new evolutionary branch of the major intrinsic protein family of aquaporin proteins and describe a previously unknown mechanism by which a large variety of solutes and water can pass through a single pore, enabling rapid cellular uptake or exit of metabolites with minimal osmotic perturbation.

Transport of solutes such as ions, nutrients, neurotransmitters, and metabolic waste products across cell membranes is of fundamental importance to all mammalian cells. Despite the identification of many selective solute transporters and water channels (1Verkman A.S. Shi L.-B. Frigeri A. Hasegawa H. Farinas J. Mitra A. Skach W. Brown D. van Hoek A.N. Ma T.

The liver is a major site of production and elimination of metabolites such as urea, nucleotides, and ketone bodies, and substantial amounts of these solutes must rapidly cross the hepatocyte plasma membrane with minimal osmotic perturbation (5Erlinger S. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jacoby W.B. Schachter D.A. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 769-786Google Scholar). In testis, a solute transport mechanism is presumably required to supply nutrients to rapidly growing spermatocytes and to provide an exit pathway for metabolites. In brain, regulation of solute transport is critical because osmolality changes in extracellular fluids can affect neuronal cell function (6Strange K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 3: 12-27PubMed Google Scholar). Among metabolically active tissues, liver was selected as a target for expression cloning of a new solute-transporting protein because a phloretin-sensitive urea exit mechanism had been described (7Hasegawa H.

Total RNA was extracted from rats fed a high protein diet (50%, w/w) for 2 weeks. Poly(A)+ RNA purified by oligo(dT) chromatography was size-fractionated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis (30Romero, M. F., Kanai, Y., Gunshin, H., and Hediger, M. A. (1998)Methods Enzymol. 296Google Scholar). Specific fractions were screened for 1 mm [14C]urea uptake activity in RNA-injected Xenopus oocytes (4You G. Smith C.P. Kanai Y. Lee W.-S. Stelzner M. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 30Romero, M. F., Kanai, Y., Gunshin, H., and Hediger, M. A. (1998)Methods Enzymol. 296Google Scholar). A directional cDNA library was constructed from the positive fraction by using the SuperScript Plasmid System (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cDNA clones were screened for urea uptake (4You G. Smith C.P. Kanai Y. Lee W.-S. Stelzner M. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA (3 μg) from rat tissues was electrophoresed in a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The filter was probed with 32P-labeled full-length AQP91 cDNA, hybridized at 42 °C, and washed with 0.1% SDS, 0.1× SSC, at 65 °C. Autoradiography was performed at −80 °C for 5 days. Digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense probes were synthesized as described (10Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tokui T. Brown D. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1506-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and hybridized on 12-μm cryosections of fresh-frozen rat liver and testis. The hybridized probes were visualized using digoxigenin Fab fragment (Boehringer Mannheim) and bromochloroindolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate. AQP9-cRNA was synthesized from pSPORT1 after linearization with NotI, using T7 RNA polymerase. Human AQP1-cDNA (a gift of Dr. Peter Agre) and rat AQP3-cDNA (a gift of Dr. Gustavo Frindt) were prepared as described previously (11Echevarria M. Windhager E.E. Tate S.S. Frindt G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10997-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 12Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). AQP1-cRNA (10 ng), AQP3-cRNA, and AQP9-cRNA (25 ng) were injected into collagenase-treated, manually defolliculated oocytes maintained at 18 °C for 2–3 days prior to assays. Radiotracer studies were performed as described (10Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tokui T. Brown D. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1506-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were incubated for 90 s with Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) including 1 mm unlabeled compound and 1–2 μCi/ml radiolabeled compound. Uptake was terminated by adding ice-cold Barth's solution with 1 mm unlabeled compound, and oocytes were solubilized in 200 μl of 10% SDS. Ps (where Ps indicates diffusive solute permeability coefficient (cm/s)) was determined from the following relation: Ps = N/(A× Δc), where N is radiotracer uptake (pmol/s);A is the membrane area (0.045 cm2), and Δc is the concentration difference of the solute (in pmol/cm3). The Arrhenius activation energy was calculated from P s values at 4, 22, and 30 °C. Water permeability was determined by volumetric swelling induced by hypotonic perturbation of oocytes (12Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). The oocytes were transferred from 200 to 70 mosm of diluted Barth's solution at 22 °C; oocyte swelling was monitored by video microscopy, and the coefficient of osmotic water permeability (Pf) was determined. The Arrhenius activation energy was calculated from Pf at 4, 22, and 30 °C. Iso-osmotic swelling assays were performed as described (11Echevarria M. Windhager E.E. Tate S.S. Frindt G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10997-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Briefly, the swelling rate of the oocytes was measured by a video microscope every 10 s for 2 min, after transferring the oocytes from standard Barth's solution to modified Barth's solution in which 88 mm NaCl was replaced by solutes (adjusted to final osmolality of 200 ± 20 mosm) or water. Osmolality was measured by freezing point depression. A two-microelectrode voltage clamp (Dagan Clampator-1B) was used to measure currents in water-injected oocytes and oocytes expressing AQP1 or AQP9. Microelectrodes (1–5 MΩ) were filled with 3 m KCl. Oocytes were superfused at 23 ± 1 °C in Barth's medium and clamped at a holding potential of −50 mV. Step changes in membrane potential (between +50 and −150 mV, in 20-mV increments) were applied for a duration of 100 ms. Current was filtered at 500 Hz, digitized at 5 kHz, and acquired using the Digidata1200 interface and pCLAMP6 software (Axon Instruments). The steady-state current-voltage relationships were determined with the help of software written by Donald D. F. Loo, UCLA School of Medicine. Functional expression of AQP9 or AQP1 in individual oocytes used for voltage-clamp experiments was subsequently confirmed by radiotracer uptakes or osmotic swelling (lysis) measurements. We first determined 1 mm [14C]urea uptake in Xenopusoocytes injected with rat liver mRNA. RNA-injected oocytes exhibited a 2-fold increase in urea uptake compared with water-injected controls (Fig. 1 A). When rats were fed a high protein diet, liver mRNA injection induced an 8-fold increase in urea uptake. Liver mRNA from rats fed a high protein diet was fractionated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis (4You G. Smith C.P. Kanai Y. Lee W.-S. Stelzner M. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and fractions were analyzed by oocyte expression. A fraction of size 1.5–2.0 kb maximally stimulated urea uptake (≈12-fold above background, data not shown). This fraction was used to construct a cDNA library from which we isolated a 1.5-kb cDNA that encodes a 295-amino acid residue hydrophobic protein, AQP9. AQP9 has low-to-moderate homology with the mammalian aquaporins AQP3 (48% identity) (11Echevarria M. Windhager E.E. Tate S.S. Frindt G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chrispeels M.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2241-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). A homologue of AQP9 was recently reported from human leucocytes (17Ishibashi K. Kuwahara M. Gu Y. Tanaka Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), but its unique properties have not yet been investigated. There is no significant homology with members of the urea transporter family. Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis predicted six transmembrane domains separated by five connecting loops (Fig. 1 D). AQP9 has two Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) consensus motifs, characteristic of members of themajor intrinsic protein (MIP) family (1Verkman A.S. Shi L.-B. Frigeri A. Hasegawa H. Farinas J. Mitra A. Skach W.

Signals of 2.2 kb were detected in testis and brain, suggesting alternative splicing or use of different polyadenylation sites. No hybridization signals were detected in kidney, colon, heart, and skeletal muscle. Nonradioactive in situ hybridization in rat liver showed that AQP9 is expressed evenly among hepatocytes (Fig. 2 B). In testis, AQP9 mRNA was detected in the inner surface of seminiferous tubules and in the interstitial Leydig cells. In seminiferous tubules, signals were obtained in spermatocytes at early developmental stages but not at later stages and not in Sertoli cells. AQP9 mRNA was detected in astrocytes throughout the brain (data not shown). When expressed in cRNA-injected oocytes, AQP9 increased the urea permeability coefficient (Ps) from 1.5 × 10−6 ± 0.2 × 10−6 cm/s (water-injected) to 23.5 × 10−6 ± 2.0 × 10−6 cm/s (Fig. 3 A). The increase in Ps was similar to that observed in oocytes expressing the urea transporters UT2 and UT3 (Ps = 25–45 × 10−6 cm/s) (cf.Refs. 4, 10, and 18). The activation energy estimated from Arrhenius plots was 7.8 ± 1.5 kcal/mol, consistent with movement through a pore. We then determined the selectivity of the AQP9 pore (Fig. 3 A) and obtained Ps values for polyols (glycerol, mannitol, and sorbitol), purines (adenine), pyrimidines (uracil and the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil), and urea analogues (thiourea) ranging from 15 to 25 × 10−6 cm/s, suggesting a promiscuous permselectivity profile for AQP9. Radiotracer uptake studies revealed that AQP9 was impermeable to cyclic sugars (d-glucose,d-mannose, and myo-inositol), the nucleoside uridine, and amino acids (glutamine and glycine) (data not shown). To investigate the effect of electric charge on solute permeability, we tested uptake of the monocarboxylates lactate and β-hydroxybutyrate, each of physiological importance in hepatocytes. TheirPs values were significantly increased at physiological pH, but an additional 4-fold increase was observed at pH 5.5 (Fig. 3 B), whereas mannitol uptake was independent of pH. In voltage-clamped oocytes expressing AQP9, monocarboxylates at concentrations up to 10 mm evoked no significant currents (less than 5 nA), regardless of pHo. Together with pH dependence of radiotracer uptakes, these results indicate that monocarboxylates permeate AQP9 only in their protonated form. The low permeabilities of the purine analogues xanthine and uric acid at pH 7.4 suggest that, likewise, these compounds permeate AQP9 in their protonated form (Fig. 3 A). We measured radiotracer uptake in oocytes expressing the aquaporins AQP1 and AQP3 to compare their solute permeabilities with those of AQP9 (Fig. 3 C). AQP1 did not mediate significant uptake of any solute tested, indicating that AQP1 is a selective water channel (1Verkman A.S. Shi L.-B. Frigeri A. Hasegawa H. Farinas J. Mitra A. Skach W. Brown D. van Hoek A.N. Ma T. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1069-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2Agre P. Brown D. Nielsen S. Curr. Opin.

Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1712-1717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). AQP3 facilitated glycerol uptake at levels similar to that for AQP9, but a weak urea permeability was detected in AQP3 (≈25% of thePs value for AQP9). In addition, AQP3 was impermeable to the urea analogue thiourea, to polyols larger than glycerol, and to purines and pyrimidines. Our results suggest that the pore selectivity in the aquaporins decreases in the order AQP1 > AQP3 > AQP9. The osmotic permeability coefficientPf was increased ≈30-fold (to 0.014 ± 0.0013 cm/s) in oocytes expressing AQP9 (cf. 0.0005 ± 0.00002 cm/s in water-injected oocytes) (Fig. 3 D). AQP9 showed a Pf similar to that for AQP1 (0.016 ± 0.0014 cm/s), but AQP3 exhibited a lower Pf (0.0073 ± 0.0008 cm/s). The Arrhenius activation energy for AQP9-mediated Pf was 3.6 ± 1.3 kcal/mol, again consistent with movement through a pore (1Verkman A.S. Shi L.-B. Frigeri A. Hasegawa H. Farinas J. Mitra A. Skach W.

Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1712-1717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Notably, unlike other known aquaporins, water permeability was sensitive to 0.1 mm phloretin (86% inhibition). In AQP9,Pf was reduced 61% in the presence of 0.3 mm HgCl2. A cysteine residue thought to be involved in mercurial binding lies 3 amino acid residues N-terminal to the second NPA box (1Verkman A.S. Shi L.-B. Frigeri A. Hasegawa H. Farinas J. Mitra A. Skach W.

Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1712-1717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, AQP9 possesses general features of water channels in addition to the distinctive phloretin-inhibitable permeability for a large variety of non-charged solutes. It has been generally considered that none of the aquaporins mediates any type of ion conductance under normal conditions (1Verkman A.S. Shi L.-B. Frigeri A. Hasegawa H. Farinas J. Mitra A. Skach W. Brown D. van Hoek A.N. Ma T. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1069-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2Agre P. Brown D. Nielsen S. Curr. Opin.

Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1712-1717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A recent report (19Yool A.J. Stamer W.D. Regan J.W. Science. 1996; 273: 1216-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) suggested that forskolin induced a nonspecific cation conductance via AQP1, despite the absence of a typical consensus protein kinase A phosphorylation site. This phenomenon has been disputed by others (20Agre P. Lee M.D. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. Sasaki S. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Fushimi K. Marumo F. Verkman A.S. Yang B. Deen P.M.T. Mulders S.M. Kansen S.M. van Os C.H. Fischbarg J. Kuang K. Li J. Iserovich P. Wen Q. Patil R.V. Han Z. Wax M.B. Science. 1997; 275: 1490-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) applying the same protocols. By using voltage-clamped oocytes expressing either AQP1 or AQP9, we determined the macroscopic conductance from the slope of the linear current-voltage relationship (between +50 mV and −150 mV) before and after superfusion with 10 μm forskolin in Barth's solution for 15 min (Fig. 3 E). Only low ionic conductance was observed in the presence and absence of forskolin, in oocytes expressing AQP1 or AQP9, and in water-injected oocytes. The reversal potential was unchanged in all groups following forskolin treatment. Forskolin administered by direct microinjection into the oocytes was also ineffective (not shown). Therefore, neither AQP1 nor AQP9 mediates any ionic conductance under basal or forskolin-treated conditions. A fundamental question is whether or not solutes and water share a single pore in AQP9. To address this issue, we first examined the inhibition profiles of solute permeabilities by phloretin and mercurial compounds. Phloretin (0.1 mm) and HgCl2 (0.3 mm) effectively inhibited the water permeability as well as the permeabilities for mannitol, uracil, adenine, and β-hydroxybutyrate (75–90%) (Fig. 3 F). Glycerol and urea permeabilities were inhibited 35–45% by 0.1 mm phloretin. Glycerol permeability was inhibited ≈50% by 0.3 mm HgCl2, but urea permeability was not significantly affected by HgCl2. In oocytes expressing AQP3, water and urea permeabilities were partially inhibited by 0.1 mm phloretin and 0.3 mmHgCl2 (15–20%), whereas the glycerol permeability was unchanged. The similar inhibition profiles of solute and water permeabilites in AQP9 indicate that solutes and water share a common transmembrane pathway. This common pathway was further investigated by volumetric assays under iso-osmotic conditions as well as by mathematical simulation of water and solute flows. Oocytes expressing AQP9 were transferred from standard Barth's solution into Barth's solution containing test solute (176 mosm). In AQP9 expressing oocytes, rapid swelling was observed for mannitol and glycerol (Fig. 4 A), whereas in AQP3 expressing oocytes, rapid swelling was observed only for glycerol (Fig. 4 B). When the test solute was replaced by water (hypo-osmotic solution), oocytes expressing AQP9 exhibited the same rapid swelling as for test solutes, suggesting that there is no discrimination between permeable solutes and water. The Staverman's reflection coefficient (ς) which is an indicator of the efficacy of a solute to induce osmosis was determined by simulation of solute and water movement (Fig. 4, A and B) using the Kedem and Katchalsky equations (Equations 1 and 2) for volume flow (J v) and solute flux (Js) (21Kedem O. Katchalsky A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 27: 229-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar, 22Mannuzzu L.M. Moronne M.M. Macey R.I. J. Member.

A ς value near unity indicates that the solute elicits the full osmotic pressure, whereas a ς value near zero indicates that the solute induces a negligible osmotic pressure. The former is indicative of distinct pathways and the latter of a common pathway for water and solute. Mathematical simulation (23Fairness J. Simanek V. Vermin A.S. Biopsy. J. 1995; 68: 1613-1620PubMed Google Scholar) according to the above equations, usingP f values from hypotonic swelling experiments (Fig. 3 D) and P s values from tracer uptake studies (Fig. 3 A), revealed ς values that were close to zero. (We did not use P s values from iso-osmotic assays (Fig. 4) because they are valid only when J v≫ J s (24Verkman A.S. Dix J.A. Seifter J.L. Am. J. Physical. 1985; 248: F650-F655PubMed Google Scholar).) Most of the permeable solutes gave ς values near zero (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, oocytes expressing AQP3 gave ς values close to unity for polyols larger than glycerol (mannitol, threitol, and erythritol) and were close to zero only for small polyols (glycerol and 1,3-propanediol). In experiments with AQP1, ς was ≈1 for all solutes tested. These data substantiate our claim that AQP9 has a common pathway for structurally unrelated neutral solutes and water. To define the selectivity of AQP9 in further detail, experiments were performed using an osmotic lysis approach (Fig. 4 D), in which solutes (176 mosm) were tested for their ability to induce osmotic lysis under iso-osmotic conditions in oocytes expressing AQP9. Osmotic lysis was induced by xylitol, erythritol, 1,3-propanediol, dimethylthiourea, and acetamide but not by raffinose, sucrose, methyl-d-glucopyranoside, glucose 6-phosphate, glycerol 3-phosphate, sodium or potassium gluconate, KCl, and choline chloride. To test the possibility that AQP9 is a rectifying solute channel, oocytes expressing AQP9 were exposed to hypertonic Barth's solutions containing 1.0 m mannitol or 1.0 m NaCl. NaCl induced shrinkage, whereas mannitol did not (data not shown), supporting the concept that AQP9 is a symmetrical channel. The discovery of AQP9 may now highlight the roles that members of the aquaporin family could play in rapid movement of solutes across cell membranes with minimal osmotic perturbation, particularly in tissues that accumulate high levels of metabolites. The liver is a major site of urea production, and a rapid urea exit mechanism is required, and the lack of specialized urea transporters and selective functional water channels in hepatocytes (1Verkman A.S.

In addition to urea, AQP9 may provide an exit route for purines and pyrimidines derived from nucleotide synthesis de novo, ensuring the plentiful supply of nucleotides to the brain, muscle, and hematopoietic tissues, in which only a salvage pathway is available (25Che M. Gatmaitan Z. Arias I.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purine and pyrimidine analogues such as 5-fluorouracil and 6-mercaptopurine are commonly used as chemotherapeutic agents. AQP9 may indirectly affect the chemosensitivity and resistance to these agents in cancer tissues. Permeation of monocarboxylates such as lactate and β-hydroxybutyrate is necessary because liver is a major site of lactate utilization and ketone body formation (5Erlinger S. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jacoby W.B. Schachter D.A. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 769-786Google Scholar). Hepatocytes secrete lactate under hypoxic conditions and export a large amount of ketone bodies such as β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate induced by fasting or diabetic conditions. Notably, AQP9 mRNA was up-regulated in liver from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. 2H. Tsukaguchi and M. A. Hediger, unpublished data. In summary, we report the first characterization of a broad selectivity, neutral solute channel, AQP9, that permits solutes to cross cell membranes rapidly and with minimal osmotic perturbation. The observations from inhibition studies (Fig. 3 F), and oocyte swelling assays (Fig. 4 A), as well as the reflection coefficients (Fig. 4 C) strongly indicate that AQP9 provides a common transmembrane pathway for both solutes and water. Our findings have significant physiological implications, particularly in cells that require absorption and excretion of large amounts of metabolites. AQP9's indiscriminate nature, which allows passage of a wide range of structurally unrelated solutes, highlights its pharmacological relevance and the need for structural studies (27Walz T. Hirai T.

Unlike viruses that do not integrate, retroviruses must conserve an ability to activate transcription from a chromatin context. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 encodes an unusual and an unusually potent transcriptional transactivator, Tat, which binds to a nascent viral leader RNA, TAR. The action of Tat has been well studied in various reductive model systems; however, the physiological mechanism through which Tat gains access to chromatin-associated proviral long terminal repeats (LTRs) is not understood. We show here that a nuclear histone acetyltransferase activity associates with Tat. Intracellularly, we found that Tat forms a ternary complex with p300 and P/CAF, two histone acetyltransferases (HATs). A murine cell defect in Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR was linked to the reduced abundance of p300 and P/CAF. Thus, overexpression of p300 and P/CAF reconstituted Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR in NIH3T3 cells to a level similar to that observed for human cells. By using transdominant p300 or P/CAF mutants that lack enzymatic activity, we delineated a requirement for the HAT component from the latter but not the former in Tat function. Finally, we observed that Tat-associated HAT is preferentially important for transactivation of integrated, but not unintegrated, HIV-1 LTR.

A recent ground-breaking finding was the demonstration that p300/CBP is not only a transcriptional adaptor but also an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (31Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V.

Whereas p300/CBP is a frequent adaptor for DNA-binding transcription factors, little is known about proteins that might “adapt” the activity of RNA-binding proteins.

Physiological mechanisms for proviral transcription must thus account for the activation of chromatin-associated viral genomes (2Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L.

Virol. 1991; 65: 6790-6799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 65Verdin E. Paras P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence that the activity of the virally encoded Tat protein describes a rate-limiting step for activation of integrated HIV-1 genomes (66Adams M. Sharmeen L. Kimpton J. Romeo J.M. Garcia J.V. Peterlin B.M. Groudine M. Emerman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3862-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although Tat has been extensively studied in various reductive paradigms (reviewed in Ref. 43Jeang K.-T. Myers G. Korber B. Foley B. Jeang K-T. Mellors J. Wain-Hobson S. HIV-1 Tat: Structure and Function. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1996: 3-18Google Scholar), to date there is no information as to how this activator mediates transcription from nucleosomally packaged long terminal repeats (LTRs). Three possibilities can be contemplated as follows: (i) the activation domain of Tat, like other potent activators (67Pazin M.J. Kamakada R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), could be inherently sufficient for remodeling chromatin; (ii) Tat could associate with SWI/SNF-like chromatin-remodeling protein machines (reviewed in Ref. 68Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Curr. Opin. Gene. Dev. 1997; 7: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar); and/or (iii) Tat could associate with a histone acetyltransferase. Here, we report on an intracellular multiprotein complex that contains Tat, p300/CBP, and P/CAF. In characterizing this complex, we find that the histone acetyltransferase activity of P/CAF is preferentially required for Tat function. Finally, we show that this activity is needed for Tat activation of integrated, but not unintegrated, HIV-1 LTR templates. Tat-associated HAT likely provides a precedent for one function that may be conserved for viruses that integrate into host chromosomes. HeLa, HeLa LTR-CAT, and NIH3T3 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells and NIH3T3 were transfected using calcium phosphate. Anti-Gal4 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-p300 monoclonal antibody and anti-EF-1α polyclonal antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; anti-P/CAF has been described previously (28Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar); and M2 anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. The 101-amino acid Tat cDNA from HIV-1 strain SF2 (provided by Ben Berkhout, University of Amsterdam) was used to construct mutants. Mutant cDNAs were prepared by polymerase chain reaction and were expressed in Escherichia coli using pGEX-2T (Pharmacia, Uppsala). CAT reporter constructs and eukaryotic Tat expression vectors have been described previously (33Berkhout B. Silverman R. Jeang K.-T. Cell. 1989; 59: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Sequencing of plasmids was performed using Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Eukaryotic expression vectors for p300 (pCMV-βp300 7), p300ΔHAT, p300ΔE1A, pCX-PCAF, and pCX-PCAF for P/CAFΔHAT (28Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar) were described previously. p300, p300 mutants, and P/CAF contain a sequence encoding Flag epitope at their 3′ ends. E. coli were grown overnight in 50 ml of LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. A 500-ml LB + ampicillin flask was inoculated with the overnight culture and was grown for 1 more hour at 37 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm to induce fusion protein expression, and the culture was switched to 30 °C for an additional 4 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation in a GSA rotor at 5800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Bacterial pellets were lysed either by sonication or by lysozyme digestion. For lysozyme digestion, the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). 10 mg of lysozyme was added, and the cells were digested for 1 h on ice. 10 ml of buffer A supplemented with 20 mm of MgCl2and 50 units of DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added, and the mixture was allowed to incubate for 15 min on ice. For sonication, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and was sonicated (Branson) for 15 pulses (70%) at the maximum microprobe setting. The resulting mixture (either from sonication or lysozyme digestion) was centrifuged in a GSA rotor at 5800 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. A second centrifugation in a SS-34 rotor at 23,500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C clarified the extract of remaining debris. Truncated variants of HIV Tat-1 (SF2 strain) were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in E. coliDH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) or BL21 (Pharmacia). Bacterial lysates were prepared as above and were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose overnight. The resin was washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 17% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol). HeLa cell (Cell Trends, Middletown, MA) extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (69Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After the first Dounce homogenization, the mixture was centrifuged once at 1500 ×g. Prior to dialysis with buffer B, 0.33 g/ml ammonium sulfate was added to precipitate proteins. The pellet was resuspended into 1 packed cell volume of buffer B and was dialyzed against 100 volumes of buffer B with two changes. Cellular extracts were incubated with the various protein-bound resins overnight at 4 °C. The resins were packed into columns, and the columns were washed with buffer B containing 0.1 m KCl. Proteins were eluted in a stepwise fashion with buffer B containing 0.25 and 0.5 KCl. The eluates were desalted and concentrated using 10,000 molecular weight cut-off microconcentration tubes (Amicon, Beverly, MA) to a final volume of 100 μl in buffer B. HeLa cell extract was prepared by a modification of the method described by Dignam et al. (69Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Columns were eluted by KCl-containing buffers. Samples were concentrated and desalted in Amicon microconcentration tubes. Assays for histone acetyltransferase activity (HAT) were conducted in 30-μl reactions at 37 oC for 20 min in buffer containing 50 μg/ml histones (Sigma), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μCi/reaction (2.3 Ci/mmol) [3H]acetyl coenzyme A (ICN). Proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed in 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid, washed with water, incubated 2 h with 1 m salicylic acid, dried, and exposed to x-ray film at −70 oC. Column eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semi-dry electroblotting (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 1 h at 400 mA. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 oC, washed, and incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibody (Tropix) for 1 h. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (Tropix, Bedford) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate. Amounts of DNA are as indicated in the figure legends, and total amounts were normalized using carrier plasmids. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were performed as described (70Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar, 71Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Various studies have indicated that the integrated HIV-1 provirus is organized into nucleosomes (64Verdin E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6790-6799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 65Verdin E. Paras P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Histone acetyltransferase is believed to be important for transcriptional activation. However, a direct role of HAT in transcription of chromatin has not been explicitly demonstrated. Thus, we explored whether HAT functions in physiological activation of HIV-1 which is integrated into host cell chromosomes. Accordingly, we first checked for the possibility that a HAT associates with the viral transactivator, Tat. We probed HeLa total cell extract using GST affinity chromatography, comparing eluates from GST and GST-Tat columns for HAT activity. Elutions from GST or GST-Tat resin were tested in reactions without (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–3) or with (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4–6) either histone or bovine serum albumin as substrates (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7–9). These incubations revealed specific acetylation of histones by an activity eluted from GST-Tat (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). To rule out that this activity might have originated from a contaminating bacterial protein, eluates from a HeLa cell extract-equilibrated GST-Tat 1–101 column (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 3) were compared with counterpart eluates from a GST-Tat 1–101 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 4) column incubated with mock extract. Acetylated histones were observed only in the former eluate (Fig. 1 B, lane 1), supporting a eukaryotic origin of Tat-associated HAT activity. Next, the region within Tat that binds HAT was characterized. Fig. 2 A shows that HAT associates with both 1- and 2-exon forms of Tat (lanes 2 and 3) suggesting that the first 72 amino acids are wholly sufficient for binding. In control incubations, we observed that Tat-associated HAT showed specific discrimination in that it did not interact with the activation domain of Sp1 (GST-Sp1A; Fig. 2 A, lane 4). Binding assays using Tat-deletion mutants revealed that GST-Tat-(1–45), GST-Tat-(1–72), GST-Tat-(20–72), and GST-Tat-(30–72) did retain a HAT, whereas GST-Tat-(1–35) and GST-Tat-(40–72) did not (Fig. 2 B). These results point to amino acids 30–45 as a region in Tat that contacts HAT. To identify the Tat-associated HAT, we surveyed column elutions using specific antisera for p300, CBP, or TAF250, three well characterized histone acetyltransferases (Fig. 3). No reactive protein was detected with either anti-CBP or anti-TAF250 (data not shown). On the other hand, p300 reactivity was observed in GST-Tat but not GST eluates (Fig. 3, compare lane 3 to lane 6). The gel migration profile of this band is also consistent with that of p300. The interaction between p300 and Tat was characterized further. We used wild type and deleted forms of p300 produced from a baculovirus overexpression system (Fig. 4 A). Four flag-tagged forms of p300 (full-length protein, p300nt (aa 1–670), p300m (aa 671–1194), or p300ct (aa 1135–2414)) were individually incubated with either GST or GST-Tat resins. After equilibration, the resins were washed extensively and then eluted with KCl buffer. Flow-through fractions, washes, and 0.25 and 0.5 m KCl elutions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4 B). None of the p300 forms bound to GST (data not shown). However, when fractions from the GST-Tat resin were examined, p300 reactivity was seen, as expected, in the flow-through fractions from each of the GST-Tat columns (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1, 5, 9, and 13). From the same columns, the absence of p300 in any of the low-salt column washes (w; Fig. 4 B, lanes 2, 6, 10, and 14) indicated that each of the protein resins had indeed been appropriately washed. Upon examination of the stepwise elutions of GST-Tat resins with 0.25 and 0.5 m KCl buffer, full-length p300 and p300nt (1–670) were found to bind Tat (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). In contrast, the p300m-(671–1194) and p300ct-(1135–2414) forms did not possess a corresponding binding activity (Fig. 4 B, lanes 11, 12, 15, and 16). Thus, the N-terminal portion of p300 (aa 1–670) specifies for Tat interaction (Fig. 4 B, lane 7 and 8). The in vitro binding results prompted us to verify for the existence of an intracellular Tat·p300 complex. To accomplish this, we transfected HeLa cells with pCMV-TatGal4, which has the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to the C terminus of Tat. 24 h after transfection, cells were immunoprecipitated with either anti-p300 (p300; Fig. 5 A, lane 1) or anti-Gal4 (Gal; Fig. 5 B, lane 2) or an unrelated control antiserum raised against the α subunit of translation elongation factor 1 (EF-1α; Fig. 5 A, lane 2, and B, lane 3). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and reciprocally probed in Western analyses with anti-Gal4 (Fig. 5 A) or anti-p300 (Fig. 5 B). In this manner, we found Tat in p300-specific immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5 A, lane 2) and p300 in Tat-specific immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5 B, lane 2). In the control anti-EF-1α immunoprecipitates, neither Tat nor p300 was found (Fig. 5 A, lane 2, and B, lane 3). Rodent cells are partially defective for Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR (72Hart C.E. Ou C.Y. Galphin J.C. Moore J. Bacheler L.T. Wasmuth J.J. Petteway S.R.

A human cell-specific factor(s) has been shown to be required for optimal TAR-dependent transactivation (72Hart C.E. Ou C.Y. Galphin J.C. Moore J. Bacheler L.T. Wasmuth J.J. Petteway S.R.

In the course of trying to understand Tat/p300 interactions, we wondered whether such interactions might be different between murine (NIH3T3) and human (HeLa) cells. As a first step in addressing this, we checked for the expression of p300 in HeLa and NIH3T3 cells using anti-p300. Surprisingly, in Western blots, we found that NIH3T3 cells had a markedly reduced (at least 10 times lower) ambient amount of p300 when compared with HeLa cells (Fig. 6, compare lanes 2 and 3). Coomassie Blue staining of the membrane verified that this reduction in the NIH3T3 sample was not due trivially to a gel-loading artifact (Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 6). In view of the low levels of p300, NIH3T3 cells represent an ideal host cell system for assessing the functional implications of the Tat/p300 interaction. We asked in transient transfections how p300 might i"

Stimulation of lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) is associated with a decrease in total cellular expression of perilipin A and B, consistent with the hypothesis that a decrease in perilipin protein expression is required for TNF-α-induced lipolysis. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of perilipin A or B maintains perilipin protein levels on the lipid droplet and blocks TNF-α-induced lipolysis. In contrast, overexpression of perilipin A or perilipin B does not inhibit isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis and does not alter the isoproterenol-induced migration of perilipins from the lipid droplet. These results provide the first evidence of how perilipin functions and suggest that TNF-α regulates lipolysis, in part, by decreasing perilipin protein levels at the lipid droplet surface.

The major form of stored energy in the body is triacylglycerol contained in white adipose tissue (1Coppack S. Jensen M. Miles J.J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 177-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In times of energy need, such as fasting and exercise, catecholamines rapidly activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA),1 resulting in hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to glycerol and free fatty acids (FFA). FFA are then used as substrates for ATP generation in diverse tissues. However, in certain pathophysiologic states such as obesity and diabetes, circulating FFA are chronically elevated (1Coppack S.

It has been suggested that chronic elevations of plasma FFA promote insulin resistance (2Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) has been associated with insulin resistance in obese animals (3Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6028) Google Scholar) and humans (4Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin.

Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 450-463Google Scholar), TNF-α increases lipolysis only after hours (>6 h) of incubation by an undetermined mechanism(s) (7Feingold K.R. Doerrler W. Dinarello C.A. Fiers W.

Higo K. Cohen A. Rafaat K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TNF-α knockout mice exhibit lower circulating FFA and are protected from the insulin resistance of obesity (10Uysal K. Wiesbrock S. Marino M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Thus, TNF-α-induced lipolysis may be one mechanism by which this cytokine is involved in the pathogenesis of the obese/diabetic state.Whereas hormonal regulation of lipolysis is well described, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Lipolysis occurs at the surface of the intracellular lipid droplet where the perilipins, a family of phosphoproteins, are specifically located (11Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.-K. Wek S.A.

The predominant perilipins in adipocytes, perilipin (Peri) A and B, arise by alternative RNA splicing from a single gene, generating predicted protein products of 57 and 46 kDa, respectively (13Greenberg A.S.

Despite their abundance and unique location at the surface of the lipid droplet, the role of the perilipins in lipolysis is unknown.In the present study we demonstrate that TNF-α decreases the protein levels of perilipins at the surface of the lipid droplet concurrent with an increase in adipocyte lipolysis. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Peri A and Peri B blocks the ability of TNF-α to increase lipolysis. These results are consistent with the model in which TNF-α increases lipolysis by decreasing the expression of perilipin proteins.DISCUSSIONThe perilipin phosphoproteins are highly expressed in adipocytes and are located at the surface of the lipid droplet, the site of lipolysis in adipocytes. Despite the location of the perilipins, their role in lipid hydrolysis is unknown. Using TNF-α-induced lipolysis as a model of reduced perilipin expression in adipocytes, the experiments described in this paper demonstrate for the first time that Peri A and B can regulate the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol. We observed that a decrease in perilipin protein levels at the lipid droplet surface is associated with TNF-α-induced lipolysis. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Peri A and B blocked TNF-α-induced lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, thus delineating one mechanism whereby this cytokine could increase the breakdown of triacylglycerol. Moreover, this effect is specific for TNF-α, because Iso-stimulated lipolysis was not altered when Peri A or B was overexpressed.Our IF studies confirm that Peri A and B are located at the surface of lipid droplets in untreated cells and indicate that TNF-α- and Iso-stimulated lipolysis are associated with reduced perilipin protein levels at the surface of the lipid droplet. TNF-α reduces total cellular perilipins and thus lipid droplet-associated perilipin protein levels while increasing adipocyte lipolysis. Overexpression of the perilipins prevents both the TNF-α-mediated reduction in perilipin protein accumulation at the surface of the lipid droplet and the ability of the cytokine to increase lipolysis. However, in Iso-treated adipocytes, the pattern of perilipin immunostaining is consistent with a reduction of perilipins at the lipid droplet surface and redistribution in the cell.3Consistent with the confocal experiments, in cell fractionation studies, Iso induces a redistribution of the perilipins from the fat (fat cake) to the infranatant.2 PKA-mediated phosphorylation, secondary to Iso stimulation, is presumably required for the redistribution of the perilipin proteins. Based on these data we propose a model of lipolysis in which perilipin accumulation at the lipid droplet surface may limit lipid hydrolysis.4 TNF-α reduces perilipin protein levels at the lipid droplet surface, resulting in an increase in lipolysis. In contrast, Iso-induced phosphorylation of perilipins would cause relocation of the perilipins, potentially increasing the accessibility of stored triacylglycerol to lipases. Further studies are necessary to extend our understanding of the role of perilipins in catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis and to delineate their mechanisms in lipid hydrolysis.The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are a class of antidiabetic agents that, by unknown mechanisms, ameliorate insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus. One suggested mechanism is that the TZDs antagonize the actions of TNF-α, resulting in decreased plasma FFA levels (9Miles P.D.G. Romeo O.M. Higo K. Cohen A. Rafaat K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,25Peraldi P. Xu M. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Increased plasma FFA have been suggested to induce systemic insulin resistance (2Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the TZDs partially blocked both the TNF-α-mediated reduction of Peri A and TNF-α-induced lipolysis (8Souza S.C. Yamamoto M. Franciosa M. Lien P. Greenberg A.

In contrast, Iso-induced phosphorylation of perilipins would cause relocation of the perilipins, potentially increasing the accessibility of stored triacylglycerol to lipases. Further studies are necessary to extend our understanding of the role of perilipins in catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis and to delineate their mechanisms in lipid hydrolysis.The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are a class of antidiabetic agents that, by unknown mechanisms, ameliorate insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus. One suggested mechanism is that the TZDs antagonize the actions of TNF-α, resulting in decreased plasma FFA levels (9Miles P.D.G. Romeo O.M. Higo K. Cohen A. Rafaat K.

Increased plasma FFA have been suggested to induce systemic insulin resistance (2Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the TZDs partially blocked both the TNF-α-mediated reduction of Peri A and TNF-α-induced lipolysis (8Souza S.C. Yamamoto M. Franciosa M. Lien P. Greenberg A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The results of this prior study are consistent with the data presented in this paper and suggest a possible role for the perilipins and TNF-α-induced lipolysis in the pathogenesis of the obese-diabetic state. The perilipin phosphoproteins are highly expressed in adipocytes and are located at the surface of the lipid droplet, the site of lipolysis in adipocytes. Despite the location of the perilipins, their role in lipid hydrolysis is unknown. Using TNF-α-induced lipolysis as a model of reduced perilipin expression in adipocytes, the experiments described in this paper demonstrate for the first time that Peri A and B can regulate the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol. We observed that a decrease in perilipin protein levels at the lipid droplet surface is associated with TNF-α-induced lipolysis. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Peri A and B blocked TNF-α-induced lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, thus delineating one mechanism whereby this cytokine could increase the breakdown of triacylglycerol. Moreover, this effect is specific for TNF-α, because Iso-stimulated lipolysis was not altered when Peri A or B was overexpressed. Our IF studies confirm that Peri A and B are located at the surface of lipid droplets in untreated cells and indicate that TNF-α- and Iso-stimulated lipolysis are associated with reduced perilipin protein levels at the surface of the lipid droplet. TNF-α reduces total cellular perilipins and thus lipid droplet-associated perilipin protein levels while increasing adipocyte lipolysis. Overexpression of the perilipins prevents both the TNF-α-mediated reduction in perilipin protein accumulation at the surface of the lipid droplet and the ability of the cytokine to increase lipolysis. However, in Iso-treated adipocytes, the pattern of perilipin immunostaining is consistent with a reduction of perilipins at the lipid droplet surface and redistribution in the cell.3Consistent with the confocal experiments, in cell fractionation studies, Iso induces a redistribution of the perilipins from the fat (fat cake) to the infranatant.2 PKA-mediated phosphorylation, secondary to Iso stimulation, is presumably required for the redistribution of the perilipin proteins.

In addition to this NADH dehydrogenase,S. cerevisiae exhibits another mitochondrial NADH-dehydrogenase activity, which oxidizes NADH at the cytosolic side of the inner membrane. To investigate whether open reading framesYMR145c/NDE1 and YDL 085w/NDE2, which exhibit sequence similarity with NDI1, encode the latter enzyme, NADH-dependent mitochondrial respiration was assayed in wild-type S. cerevisiae and nde deletion mutants. Mitochondria were isolated from aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures grown at a dilution rate (D) of 0.10 h−1, in which reoxidation of cytosolic NADH by wild-type cells occurred exclusively by respiration. Compared with the wild type, rates of mitochondrial NADH oxidation were about 3-fold reduced in annde1Δ mutant and unaffected in an nde2Δmutant. NADH-dependent mitochondrial respiration was completely abolished in an nde1Δ nde2Δ double mutant. Mitochondrial respiration of substrates other than NADH was not affected in nde mutants. In shake flasks, an nde1Δ nde2Δ mutant exhibited reduced specific growth rates on ethanol and galactose but not on glucose. Glucose metabolism in aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures (D = 0.10 h−1) of an nde1Δ nde2Δ mutant was essentially respiratory.

During dissimilation of sugars via respiration by eukaryotic cells, glycolysis leads to NAD+ reduction in the cytosol, whereas mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate via the pyruvate-dehydrogenase complex and the trichloroacetic acid cycle yields NADH in the mitochondrial matrix. As the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to NADH (1Lehninger A.L. The Harvey Lectures 1953–1954. Academic Press, New York1955: 176-215Google Scholar, 2von Jagow G. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), respiratory growth requires continuous reoxidation of this cofactor in the cytosol as well as in the mitochondrial matrix. The mitochondrial inner membrane of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains at least two NADH:ubiquinone-6 oxidoreductases (‘NADH dehydrogenases') that may couple the oxidation of NADH to the mitochondrial respiratory chain (2 - 5). The catalytic site of one of these, commonly referred to as the ‘internal' NADH dehydrogenase, faces the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, it can oxidize the intramitochondrial NADH generated by the pyruvate-dehydrogenase complex and the TCA cycle (2von Jagow G. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast to the classical ‘complex I' NADH dehydrogenases of higher eukaryotes, the ‘internal' NADH dehydrogenase of growing S. cerevisiae cells is not proton translocating (5de Vries S. Marres C.A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 205-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 6Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 301: 105-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The enzyme consists of a single subunit encoded by the nuclear NDI1 gene (7de Vries S. van Witzenburg R. Grivell L.A. Marres C.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mutants in whichNDI1 is inactivated do not oxidize intramitochondrial NADH (8Marres C.A.M. de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition to the NDI1-encoded ‘internal' NADH dehydrogenase, S. cerevisiae is able to synthesize another inner membrane NADH dehydrogenase, commonly referred to as external NADH dehydrogenase, the catalytic site of which faces the intermembrane space (Refs. 2von Jagow G. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 3Ohnishi T. Kawaguchi K. Hagihara B. J. Biol.

In contrast to the mitochondria of fungi and plants (9Møller I.M. Lin W. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. 1986; 37: 309-334Crossref Google Scholar, 10Douce R. Neuburger M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 371-414Crossref Google Scholar), mammalian mitochondria do not harbor external NADH dehydrogenases and therefore depend on redox shuttle mechanisms to couple the oxidation of cytosolic NADH to internal NADH dehydrogenases (11Dawson A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1979; 4: 171-176Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The presence of an external NADH dehydrogenase in yeast mitochondria correlates with the absence of a functional malate-aspartate shuttle (5de Vries S. Marres C.A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 205-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12Hollenberg C.P. Riks W.F. Borst P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 201: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), one of the major redox shuttles in mammalian mitochondria (11Dawson A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1979; 4: 171-176Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the key enzymes for two alternative systems, the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase system and the ethanol-acetaldehyde shuttle (Fig. 1), have both been demonstrated in S. cerevisiae (2von Jagow G. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 13Rønnow B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1121-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Björkqvist S. Ansell R. Adler L. Lidén G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 128-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study indicated that the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase system contributes to the oxidation of cytosolic NADH under certain conditions but that it is not essential for respiratory growth of S. cerevisiae (15Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The relative importance of the various proposed systems for respiratory oxidation of cytosolic NADH by S. cerevisiae mitochondria is at present unclear. Even under aerobic conditions, alcoholic fermentation rather than respiration is the predominant mode of sugar metabolism in S. cerevisiae (16Lagunas R. Yeast. 1986; 2: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fully respiratory growth on sugars is only possible during sugar-limited cultivation below the so called critical specific growth rate (μcrit). Above μcrit, respiration and aerobic alcoholic fermentation occur simultaneously, even in sugar-limited cultures (17Petrik M. Käppeli O. Fiechter A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 43-49Google Scholar, 18Käppeli O. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1986; 28: 181-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Postma E. Verduyn C. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 468-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aerobic fermentation negatively affects the biomass yield on sugars (20Verduyn C. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1991; 60: 325-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, biomass-directed industrial applications of S. cerevisiae, such as the production of bakers' yeast and heterologous proteins, have to be performed at submaximal growth rates in aerobic, sugar-limited fed-batch cultures (21Beudeker R.F. van Dam H.W. van der Plaat J.B. Vellenga K. Verachtert H. De Mot R. Yeast Bio/Technology and Biocatalysis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1990: 103-146Google Scholar, 22Hensing M.C.M. Rouwenhorst R.J. Heijnen J.J. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1995; 67: 261-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Competition between mitochondria and alcohol dehydrogenase for cytosolic NADH formed in glycolysis may be a relevant factor in the occurrence of aerobic fermentation. Therefore, insight into the mechanisms of respiratory NADH oxidation by S. cerevisiae mitochondria is not only of fundamental interest but also relevant for the industrial application of this yeast. Physiological characterization of mutants lacking one or more of the possible NADH-oxidizing mechanisms (Fig. 1) seems a powerful tool to investigate their physiological significance. A major complication for such studies is that, so far, the gene(s) encoding external NADH dehydrogenase(s) in S. cerevisiae have not been identified. The S. cerevisiae genome harbors two open reading frames (YMR145c and YDL085w), which exhibit high similarity with NDI1, the structural gene encoding the internal mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these open reading frames are structural genes encoding mitochondrial external NADH dehydrogenase and to determine whether their products are essential for respiratory growth on sugars. The S. cerevisiaestrains used in this study are listed in Table I. They were grown to stationary phase in shake-flask cultures on a mineral medium with vitamins (23Verduyn C. Postma E. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1992; 8: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), which was set at pH 6.0 and contained 20 g·liter−1 glucose. After adding sterile glycerol (30% v/v), 2-ml aliquots were stored in sterile vials at −80 °C. These frozen stock cultures were used to inoculate precultures for batch and chemostat experiments.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainRelevant genotypeCEN.PK113–7DMATa URA3 HIS3 LEU2 TRP1 MAL2–8 SUC2CEN.PK122MATa/MATα URA3/URA3 HIS3/HIS3 LEU2/LEU2 TRP1/TRP1 MAL2–8/MAL2–8 SUC2/SUC2CEN.PK152MATa URA3 HIS3 LEU2 TRP1 MAL2–8 SUC2 ymr145c(41–1659)::loxP-kanMX4-loxPCEN.PK162MATa URA3 HIS3 LEU2 TRP1 MAL2–8 SUC2 ydl085w(51–100)::loxP-kanMX4-loxPCEN.PK163MATα URA3 HIS3 LEU2 TRP1 MAL2–8 SUC2 ydl085w(51–100)::loxP-kanMX4-loxPCEN.PK167–2BMATa URA3 HIS3 LEU2 TRP1 MAL2–8 SUC2 ymr145c(41–1659)::loxP-kanMX4-loxP ydl1085w(51–100)::loxP-kanMX4-loxPThe numbers in parentheses indicate the deleted nucleotides (ATG = 1) of the corresponding genes.

Standard techniques and media for genetic modification of S. cerevisiae were used (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Deletions in YMR145c and YDL085w were obtained by the short flanking homology (SFH)1method (25Wach A. Brachat A. Poehlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). SFH deletion cassettes were made with primers homologous to both the kanamycin resistance gene (the kanMX module) and the gene of interest. For each open reading frame, a pair of oligonucleotides (Table II) was designed to contain 40 nucleotides at the 5′-end homologous to the target yeast sequence and 19–21 nucleotides at the 3′-end homologous to the pUG6 multiple cloning site (26Güldener U.

Open table in a new tab Construction of disruption cassettes and disruption of genes and analytical PCR were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequences complementary to the multiple cloning site of pUG6 are underlined. PCR was carried out as follows. Each 100-μl PCR reaction contained 10 μl of 10 × PCR buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 500 mm KCl), 200 μm dNTP mix, 30–60 ng of pUG6 plasmid as template DNA, 30 pmol of each primer, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (27Pluthero F.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4850-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Amplification parameters were 94 °C for 2 min (hot start) and then 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. For quantification of the amount of PCR product, aliquots were loaded on an agarose gel. After ethanol precipitation of the SFH-PCR products, yeast cells were transformed using the improved lithium acetate method (26Güldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 28Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). For selection of transformants, geneticin (G-418 sulfate, Life Technologies) was added at a final concentration of 200 μg·ml−1. For the construction of single gene deletions in YMR145c and YDL085w, respectively, the SFH-PCR products were transformed to the prototrophic strains CEN.PK113–7D and/or CEN.PK122. To obtain a strain deleted for both YMR145c and YDL085w, strains CEN.PK152 (nde1Δ) and CEN.PK163 (nde2Δ) were crossed. After tetrad analysis, spores showing the nonparental ditype for thekanMX marker were subsequently analyzed by diagnostic PCR to confirm correct deletion of both genes. Correct gene deletion was verified by analytical PCR with whole yeast cells directly taken from a YPD plate. Two pairs of primers (A1/K1 and A4/K2, Table II) were used to check the two junctions corresponding to the replacement. For this, oligonucleotides were designed to bind outside the deleted gene 900–1000 nucleotides upstream of the ATG (A1) and 500 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon (A4). Primers K1 and K2 bind within thekanMX marker module. Amplification parameters were 94 °C for 2 min (hot start) and then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. About 5 μl of a 50-μl PCR reaction were loaded on an agarose gel. The mating types of the prototrophic CEN.PK strains used in this study were determined by PCR with whole yeast cells according to Huxley et al. (29Huxley C. Green E.D. Dunham I. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Aerobic chemostat cultivation was performed at 30 °C in 2-liter laboratory fermenters (Applikon, Schiedam, the Netherlands) at a stirrer speed of 800 rpm. The working volume was kept at 1.0 liter by a peristaltic effluent pump coupled to an electrical level sensor. Biomass concentrations in samples taken directly from the cultures differed by less than 1% from those in samples taken from the effluent line (30Noorman H.J. Baksteen J. Heijnen J.J. Luyben K.Ch. A.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 2171-2177Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The dilution rate (which, in steady-state cultures is equal to the specific growth rate) was set at 0.10 h−1. A steady state was defined as the situation in which at least five volume changes had passed since the last change in dilution rate and in which the biomass concentration, as well as the specific rates of carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption, had remained constant (<2% variation) for at least two volume changes. Steady-state cultures did not exhibit detectable metabolic oscillations. The pH was kept at 5.0 by an Applikon ADI 1030 biocontroller, via the automatic addition of 2 m KOH. The fermenter was sparged with air at a flow rate of 0.5 liter·min−1 using a Brooks 5876 mass-flow controller. The dissolved oxygen concentration was continuously monitored with an oxygen electrode (Ingold, model 34 100 3002) and remained above 50% of air saturation. The defined mineral medium with vitamins was prepared as described by Verduyn et al. (23Verduyn C. Postma E. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1992; 8: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) and contained 7.5 g·liter−1 glucose as the carbon source. Chemostat cultures were routinely checked for purity by phase-contrast microscopy and by plating on YPD agar plates. Culture samples (10 ml) were filtered over preweighed nitrocellulose filters (pore size 0.45 μm, Gelman Sciences). After removal of medium, the filters were washed with demineralized water, dried in a Sharp type R-4700 microwave oven for 20 min at 360 W output, and weighed. Duplicate determinations varied by less than 1%. Glucose in reservoir media and supernatants of chemostat cultures was determined enzymatically with a hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Concentrations of ethanol, glycerol, and acetate were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (31Flikweert M.T. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3399-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High pressure liquid chromatography analyses were confirmed by enzymic analysis of these metabolites (32Pronk J.T. Steensma H.Y. van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1607-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The exhaust gas of chemostat cultures was cooled in a condenser (2 °C) and dried with a Perma Pure dryer (type PD-625-12P). Oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations were determined with a Servomex type 1100A analyzer and a Beckman model 864 infrared detector, respectively. The exhaust gas flow rate was measured as described previously (33Weusthuis R.A. Visser W. Pronk J.T. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Specific rates of carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption were calculated as described by van Urk et al. (34van Urk H. Mak P.R. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1988; 4: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from glucose-limited, aerobic chemostat cultures by a procedure based on that described for Candida utilis by Bruinenberg et al. (35Bruinenberg P.M. van Dijken J.P. Kuenen J.G. Scheffers W.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 1043-1051Google Scholar). Biomass (approximately 1.5 g dry weight) was harvested by centrifugation at 1600 × g for 4 min. The pellet was then resuspended in 30 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (0.1m, pH 9.3) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation (4 min, 1250 × g), the pellet was washed with 40 ml of buffer A (25 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), containing 2m sorbitol and resuspended in 35 ml of buffer A containing 2 m sorbitol. 10.2 mg of zymolyase (from Arthobacter luteus, 20.000 units·g−1, ICN Biochemicals) was dissolved in 0.1 ml of buffer A containing 2 m sorbitol and added to the cell suspension, which was subsequently incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. This incubation period was chosen based on control experiments in which lysis of spheroplasts was periodically assayed by dilution of samples in demineralized water (35Bruinenberg P.M. van Dijken J.P. Kuenen J.G. Scheffers W.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 1043-1051Google Scholar). All subsequent steps were carried out on ice or in a cooled (4 °C) centrifuge. Spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation (7 min, 2800 × g). The pellet was washed with 40 ml of buffer A containing 2 m sorbitol and resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer. Subsequently, 30 ml of buffer A containing 0.2m sorbitol was added dropwise while the suspension was slowly stirred with a magnetic stirrer bar. The spheroplast suspension was subjected to 10 strokes in a cooled Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (100 rpm, clearance 28 μm). After centrifugation (10 min, 2000 × g), the homogenate (supernatant) was separated from unbroken cells and debris and spun again (10 min, 7800 ×g). The resulting pellet, containing the mitochondria, was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A with 0.65 m sorbitol and 1 mg·ml−1 bovine serum albumin (fatty acid free, Sigma) and kept on ice. In this protocol, relative centrifugal forces represent average values at the applied rotational speeds, for completely filled centrifuge tubes in the Sorvall GSA and SS34 rotors, as reported by the manufacturer. Substrate-dependent oxygen consumption rates of mitochondria were determined polarographically at 30 °C with a Clark-type oxygen electrode. The assay mixture (3 ml) contained 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.65 m sorbitol. Reactions were started with ethanol (5 mm), succinate (5 mm),l-glycerol-3-phosphate (5 mm), orl-malate + pyruvate (5 mm). Commercial preparations of NADH are contaminated with ethanol (36Patchett R.A. Jones C.W. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1986; 52: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, NADH was generated in the oxygen uptake assays by addition of 5 mm glucose, 0.2 mm NAD+, and 1.5 units·ml−1 of Bacillus megaterium glucose dehydrogenase (Sigma). Oxygen uptake rates were calculated based on a dissolved oxygen concentration of 236 μm in air-saturated water at 30 °C. Respiratory control values were determined by adding 0.25 mm ADP (37Chance B. Williams G.R. Adv. Enzymol. 1956; 17: 65-134PubMed Google Scholar). The protein content of whole cells was estimated by a modified biuret method (38Verduyn C. Postma E. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of mitochondrial preparations were estimated by the Lowry method. Dried bovine serum albumin (fatty acid free, Sigma) was used as a standard. Where necessary, protein determinations were corrected for bovine serum albumin present in the mitochondrial preparations. According to the literature, commercial preparations of NADH are contaminated with ethanol (36Patchett R.A. Jones C.W. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1986; 52: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of NADH obtained from Boehringer Mannheim confirmed that fresh solutions prepared in distilled water contained 0.48 ± 0.04 mol ethanol (mol NADH)−1. Since ethanol is readily oxidized by S. cerevisiae mitochondria (Ref. 2von Jagow G. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, Table III), this precluded the direct use of commercial NADH in oxygen uptake studies with mitochondrial isolates. Attempts to remove ethanol by incubation with acetic acid bacteria resulted in the partial degradation of NADH (data not shown). As NAD+ was found to be free from ethanol contamination, the possibility was investigated to generate NADH in the oxygen uptake assays by addition of glucose and NAD+, together with NAD+-dependent glucose dehydrogenase fromBacillus megaterium (see “Experimental Procedures”). Oxygen uptake by wild-type mitochondria could be observed only when all three components of this system for NADH regeneration were added (data not shown). Using this system, the respiratory control ratio for oxidation of NADH by wild-type mitochondria was about 3 (Table III), indicating that NADH oxidation was functionally coupled to oxidative phosphorylation. The glucose dehydrogenase system was used in all further experiments on NADH oxidation by mitochondrial preparations.Table IIISubstrate-dependent rates of oxygen consumption by mitochondria from wild-type S. cerevisiae CEN.PK113–7D and null mutants in open reading frames YMR145c (NDE1) and YDL085w (NDE2)SubstrateS. cerevisiae CEN.PK113–7D (NDE1 NDE2)S. cerevisiaeCEN.PK152 (nde1ΔNDE2)S. cerevisiae CEN.PK162 (NDE1 nde2Δ)S. cerevisiae CEN.PK167–2B (nde1Δnde2Δ)O2 uptake rateRCO2 uptake rateRCO2 uptake rateRCO2 uptake rateRCμmol · (mg protein) · minNADH0.22 ± 0.063.0 ± 0.30.08 ± 0.041.8 ± 0.20.28 ± 0.012.6 ± 0.10.0 ± 0.0Malate + pyruvate0.11 ± 0.011.7 ± 0.10.16 ± 0.012.0 ± 0.30.15 ± 0.012.0 ± 0.20.15 ± 0.022.0 ± 0.1Ethanol0.10 ± 0.021.4 ± 0.10.11 ± 0.021.4 ± 0.10.16 ± 0.031.7 ± 0.10.15 ± 0.031.6 ± 0.1l-glycerol-3-phosphate0.18 ± 0.042.3 ± 0.10.22 ± 0.062.5 ± 0.30.25 ± 0.042.2 ± 0.30.26 ± 0.032.6 ± 0.3Succinate0.10 ± 0.021.6 ± 0.10.13 ± 0.012.4 ± 0.40.13 ± 0.021.9 ± 0.20.17 ± 0.043.0 ± 0.3Cells were pregrown in aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures at a dilution rate of 0.10 h−1.

Experimental results are the average ± S.D. (ςn) of measurements with at least two independent mitochondrial isolations for each strain. To identify candidate structural genes encoding the mitochondrial external NADH dehydrogenase of S. cerevisiae, the deduced amino acid sequence encoded by the unique gene encoding the internal NADH dehydrogenase (7de Vries S. van Witzenburg R. Grivell L.A. Marres C.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was compared with the entire S. cerevisiae genome sequence (39Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. et al.Science. 1996; 274: 546-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar). Data base searches using services offered by MIPS (BLAST, 40) yielded two open reading frames with unknown function, YMR145c and YDL085w. Sequence alignment of Ndi1 to the predicted peptide sequences encoded by YMR145c and YDL085w revealed identities of 48% and 46%, respectively. An even higher identity of 63% was found when the predicted peptide sequence encoded byYMR145c and YDL085w were compared. The observed sequence identity was found along the whole length of the three predicted peptide sequences. Interestingly in contrast to Ndi1p, the putative peptides encoded by YMR145c and YDL085wshowed N-terminal extensions of 30 and 45 amino acids, respectively. These extensions are of interest as they might theoretically be involved in targeting of the proteins to the appropriate subcellular locations. YMR145c exhibits a codon adaptation index of 0.26, which is indicative of a moderately expressed gene, similar toNDI1 (codon adaptation index 0.19). YDL085wexhibited a lower codon adaptation index of 0.14. Based on their similarity with NDI1, YMR145c and YDL085w were tentatively named NDE1 and NDE2 (NADH dehydrogenase,external), respectively. To investigate whether open reading frames YMR145c/NDE1 and YDL085w/NDE2 are indeed structural genes encoding mitochondrial external NADH dehydrogenases, NADH-dependent respiration was studied in isolated mitochondria from wild-type S. cerevisiae and from isogenic mutants in which either NDE1, NDE2, or both had been deleted. Mitochondria were isolated from aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures grown at a dilution rate of 0.10 h−1. Under these conditions, wild-type S. cerevisiae did not exhibit alcoholic fermentation (see below), indicating that cytosolic NADH was efficiently reoxidized by the mitochondria. Such a situation cannot be accomplished in batch cultures on glucose where, because of glucose repression of respiratory enzymes, alcoholic fermentation is the predominant mode of NADH reoxidation (16Lagunas R. Yeast. 1986; 2: 221-228"

Due to their high stability and chemical versatility, manganese porphyrins are a promising group of compounds for development as SOD1 mimics. Introducing β-electron-withdrawing substituents and modifying mesosubstituents of water soluble porphyrins can have a major impact on the redox and electrostatic properties of manganese porphyrins (1Takeuchi T.

Such substitution allows the redox potential to approach the potential of SOD itself, E½ ∼ +0.26 V (8Barrette Jr., W.C. Sawyer D.T. Fee J.A. Asada K. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This is approximately midway between the redox potentials of the two half-reactions of the dismutation process (9Koppenol W.H. Butler J. Adv. Free Radical Biol.

While maintaining the redox potential at a value close to that of SOD, it is important to also ensure electrostatic facilitation. We have already shown that β-bromination (11Richards R.A. Hammons K.

However, the large positive redox potential of the former, E½ = +0.480 mV versus NHE, (13Batinić-Haberle I. Liochev S.I. Spasojević I. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) stabilizes manganese in its 2+ state and diminishes stability, and the latter compound had only modest activity, probably due to lack of electrostatic facilitation (13Batinić-Haberle I. Liochev S.I. Spasojević I. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It has been shown that ortho substitution on themeso phenyl ring exhibits an ortho effect that is as strong as if the same substituent were placed directly on themeso position (14Meot-Ner M. Adler A.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 5107-5111Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus,meso-tetrakis(2-methylphenyl)porphyrin behaves similar to the meso tetramethylporphyrin (14Meot-Ner M. Adler A.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 5107-5111Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The same was found for other porphyrins in which meso phenyl groups have differentortho substituents, as well as when meso groups are ortho pyridyls, such as 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(N-methylpyridinium-2-yl) (H2TM-2-PyP4+) and its zinc complex, ZnTMP-2-PyP4+ (15Hambright P.

Such a profound impact on the properties of the ortho isomers, known as theortho effect, is due to the combined effect of inductive, resonance, and steric factors (20Kalyanasundaram K. Inorg.

For this reason, we explored the ortho isomer of manganese(III) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methylpyridyl)porphyrin (MnTMPyP5+) and expected more favorable electrostatic facilitation due to the positively charged pocket formed in both the αααα and αααβ atropoisomers (22Collman J.P.

The manganese complexes were prepared by metallation of the porphyrin ligands in either water or in methanol at porphyrin:manganese ratios of 1:5, 1:13, and 1:100. In both solvents and at all metal to porphyrin ratios, the same compound, as evidenced by the Soret band, was obtained. Metallation in methanol was accomplished under refluxing conditions, whereas in water it was achieved at room temperature. When the pH of the water was raised to ∼12.3 (20Kalyanasundaram K. Inorg.

Routinely, a 1:20 ratio of porphyrin to metal in water at room temperature was applied. The reaction was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. Upon completion of metallation (pH brought to ∼7), the solution was filtered to remove manganese hydroxo species, and the PF6− salt of manganese complex was precipitated by the addition of a concentrated aqueous solution of NH4PF6 (11Richards R.A.

The compound was then dissolved in acetone, the solution was filtered, and a concentrated acetone solution of tetrabutylammonium chloride was added, until the majority of the porphyrin had precipitated in the form of its chloride salt. The precipitate was washed thoroughly with acetone and dried in vacuo at room temperature. Usually the chloride salt was again dissolved in water and precipitated as PF6− salt. The latter was again dissolved in acetone and reisolated as chloride salt. This procedure ensured elimination of excess of metal. The chloride salts of metalloporphyrins were analyzed in terms of elemental analysis, UV-visible spectroscopy (in the range of 0.5–50 μm), and thin-layer chromatography.

The estimated errors in ɛ are within ±2%. We obtained ε(MnTM-4-PyP5+) = 130,000 cm−1m−1, whereas the literature value is 93,000 cm−1m−1 (26Harriman, A., and Porter, G. (1979) J. Chem. Soc. Faraday. Trans. II 1532–1542Google Scholar). Also, our molar absorptivity for MnTM-2-PyPCl5 is 129,000 cm−1m−1, whereas the literature value is 190,000 cm−1m−1 (27Hambright P. J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem. 1977; 39: 1102-1103Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One explanation for this discrepancy is the inadequate procedures used previously, usually aggressive ones that afford undesired substitution of the ring or even cause its reduction (27Hambright P. J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem. 1977; 39: 1102-1103Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and eventual degradation. The efficient yet nonaggressive metallation in water should be the most appropriate choice. Exposure of porphyrin to theN,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), especially when DMF is either a metallation medium or a solvent for modification of the porphyrin under refluxing conditions, during which it undergoes decomposition (28Kadish K.M. Araullo-McAdams C. Han B.C. Franzen M.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 8364-8368Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 29Boschi T. Licoccia S. Tagliatesta P. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1986; 119: 191-194Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), should be avoided whenever possible. We have found that both metalloporphyrin (MnTMPyP5+) and its parent ligand (H2TMPyP4+) suffer significant changes when exposed to either anhydrous DMF or DMF/H2O (9:1) at ∼90 °C for prolonged periods. Thus, in 48 h, the molar absorptivity of a metal-free porphyrin falls to 50% of its initial value. The same happened when metalloporphyrin was left for 48 h in DMF/H2O (9:1) at ∼90 °C. Under anhydrous conditions, the metalloporphyrin is more resistant. The same changes were previously observed in the case of manganese(III) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (MnTBAP+ 5). The modification of the porphyrin ring, hydrogen bonding interaction of the pyrrole nitrogen hydrogen with DMF (30Trofimov, B. A., Shatenshtein, A. I., Petrov, E. S., Terekhova, M. I., Golovanova, N. I., Mikhaleva, A. I., Korostova, S. E., and Vasil'ev, A. N., Khim. Geterotsikl. Soedin. (1980) 632–638Google Scholar), dimerization, and metal-centered reduction are among possible routes that can lead to the complete destruction of the porphyrin ring. 4I. Batinić-Haberle, unpublished results. The stability of manganese porphyrins was studied under strongly acidic and alkaline conditions and in the presence of up to 1000-fold excess EDTA. All three porphyrins were resistant to protonation as well as to ligand exchange. Even after ∼1 h in 36% hydrochloric acid, no demetallation was observed at ∼6 μm porphyrin concentration. A very slow demetallation was observed in 98% sulfuric acid in the case of meta compound, where ∼50% of demetallation occurred at 6 μm porphyrin in a 24-h period at room temperature. Under the same conditions, only negligible demetallation was observed in the case of para, whereas theortho isomer appeared to be the most resistant, showing no observable demetallation in 24 h. Their stability can be ascribed to the combination of steric hindrance and electronic effects (31Longo F.R. Brown E.M. Quimby D.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1973; 206: 420-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,32Davila, J., Harriman, A., Richoux, M.-C., and Milgrom, L. R. (1987) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 525–527Google Scholar). The stability toward H2O2 was measured at 25 °C with 5 μm porphyrin, 5 mmH2O2 in 0.05 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.8. The half-times for the oxidative degradation of the porphyrin ring were 105, 28, and 30 s for the ortho, meta, and para isomers, respectively. This observation is consistent with their redox properties, i.e. resistance toward oxidation (anodic shift of both reduction and oxidation potentials) (1Takeuchi T. Gray H.B. Goddard III, W.A. J. Am.

Dalton Trans. 3429–3436Google Scholar), due to the closer position and therefore greater inductive effect of the ortho positive charges on the porphyrin ring. Xanthine oxidase was the source of O⨪2, and ferricytochrome c was its indicating scavenger (33McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of cytochrome c was followed at 550 nm. Assays were conducted in the presence and absence of 0.1 mm EDTA in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, ± 15 μg/ml of catalase. Rate constants for the reaction of metalloporphyrins with O⨪2 were based upon the competition with 10 μmcytochrome c, k cyt c = 2.6 × 105m−1 s−1 (34Butler J. Koppenol W.H. Margoliash E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10747-10750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). O⨪2 was produced at the rate of 1.2 μm/min. Possible interference through inhibition of the xanthine/xanthine oxidase reaction by test compounds was examined by following the rate of urate accumulation at 295 nm in the absence of cytochromec. All measurements were done at 25 °C. These interactions were followed by UV-visible spectroscopy, by cyclic voltammetry, through inhibition of their SOD-like activity, and by ultrafiltration. The interaction of metalloporphyrins with nucleic acids was performed both in the presence (27 mm) and absence of ascorbic acid in 0.05 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.8, at 6 μm porphyrin, 4.7 mm DNA and RNA. The RNA stock solutions, ranging between 18 and 76 mm, were prepared in water, whereas DNA stock solutions ranging between 18 and 38 mm were prepared in buffer due to the lower DNA solubility. The concentration of nucleic acids was calculated on the basis of mononucleotide. All the experiments with ascorbate were performed anaerobically in a specially designed cuvette (35Hodgson E.K. McCord J.M. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 51: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) purged with argon. The retention of the porphyrins by a molecular weight 3000 cut-off filter ± the nucleic acids (11 and 22 mm) was determined filtering the 0.5 mmsolutions of porphyrin in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 0.1 m NaCl. The assay was performed at the porphyrin concentration that caused 50% inhibition of the cytochromec reduction (IC50). At the IC50porphyrin concentration, its SOD activity was titrated with nucleic acid in the concentration range of 0.4–21 μm, depending upon the isomer investigated. Measurements were performed using CH Instruments (computer supported) model 600 Voltammetric Analyzer. A three-electrode setup system in a small volume cell (0.5–3 ml, with a 3 mm-diameter button glassy carbon working electrode (Bioanalytical Systems) was used. Prior to each experiment, the electrode was cleaned with 0.3 μm alumina, sonicated in deionized water for 1 min, rinsed with stream of distilled water, wiped with a paper tissue, and allowed to air dry for 5 min. The reference electrode was a standard Ag/AgCl electrode (Bioanalytical Systems, 3 m NaCl gel filling solution), and the auxilliary electrode was a 0.5-mm platinum wire. Solutions containing 0.05m phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 0.1 m NaCl and 0.5 mm metalloporphyrin were used. The effect of nucleic acids (0.05–45 mm) on the redox properties of the metalloporphyrins was studied. Ultrapure argon (less than 1 ppm oxygen), humidified, was purged through all the solutions for 30 min. Scan rates were 10–500 mV/s, typically 100 mV/s. Escherichia coli strains wild type AB1157 (control strain) and SOD-deficient JI132 (sodAsodB) were obtained from J. A. Imlay (36Imlay J.A. Linn S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Growth was followed in casamino acids medium and in minimal (five amino acids) medium (37Faulkner K.M. Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23471-23476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cultures were diluted 1:200 from overnight cultures into minimal salts, 0.2% glucose, and 0.2% casamino acids and grown as described previously (37Faulkner K.M. Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23471-23476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deionized water was used throughout. The porphyrins were added after inoculation in the range of 5–150 μm. Growth was followed turbidimetrically at 700 nm. Anaerobic conditions were achieved in a Coy chamber. The isomers of manganese(III)meso-tetrakis(N-methyl-pyridyl)porphyrin were prepared from their parent metal-free ligands and were characterized. The metal-free ligands were characterized as well, and their UV-visible data, given under “Materials and Methods,” agree well with literature data (15Hambright P. Gore T. Burton M. Inorg. Chem. 1976; 15: 2314-2315Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The metalloporphyrins resist strongly acidic (36% HCl) and basic conditions (1 m NaOH). Theortho isomer appeared thrice as resistant toward oxidative degradation with H2O2 than the paraone, which is consistent with the anodic shift of the redox potential due to the ortho effect (15Hambright P.

Consistent with the sameortho effect, a blue shift of the Soret band was observed in the case of the ortho isomer. The molar absorptivities of the ortho and para isomers of manganese complexes were almost equal, as are the absorptivities of their diprotonated parent ligands as reported here and elsewhere (20Kalyanasundaram K.

The concentration that causes 50% of the inhibition of cytochromec reduction by O⨪2, IC50 (1 unit of activity) was found at (v o/v i) – 1 = 1.

No SOD activity was observed for all three isomers of metal-free porphyrins. None of these compounds interfered with the xanthine oxidase reaction.

https://openalex.org/W1981124481,"Involvement of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in interleukin (IL)-6 gene expression of human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) was assessed. p38 MAP kinase was constitutively expressed in human FLSs and activated in response to IL-1beta. A pyridinylimidazole compound, SB203580, inhibited p38 MAP kinase activity in vivo, since the activity of MAPKAP kinase-2 (a substrate of p38 MAP kinase) in IL-1beta-stimulated FLSs was totally suppressed by it. SB203580 concentration-dependently inhibited protein production and gene expression of IL-6 by human FLSs. The effect of SB203580 was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. SB203580 significantly reduced the stability of IL-6 mRNA without affecting the rate of IL-6 gene transcription. Here, we provide evidence that p38 MAP kinase is activated in response to IL-1beta in human FLSs and is involved in IL-6 synthesis by stabilizing IL-6 mRNA."

We have previously demonstrated that quenching of CREB-associated proteins in metastatic melanoma cells by a dominant-negative CREB (KCREB) that is mutated within its DNA-binding domain decreased their radiation resistance, and their tumorigenic and metastatic potential in nude mice. As the induction of apoptosis by diverse exogenous signals is dependent on the elevation of intracellular Ca2+, the purpose of this study was to determine the role of CREB and its associated proteins in apoptosis using KCREB. We used thapsigargin (Tg), which inhibits endoplasmic reticulum-dependent Ca2+-ATPase and thereby increases cytosolic Ca2+, to induce apoptosis. MeWo human melanoma cells were transfected with the KCREB expression vector and subsequently analyzed for their susceptibility to Tg-induced apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that expression of KCREB in MeWo cells rendered them susceptible to Tg-induced apoptosis. Tg treatment induced phosphorylation of CREB and possibly ATF-1 transcription factors. Treatment with Tg induced CRE-dependent transcription in parental cells, whereas this activation was reduced in the KCREB-transfected cells. In addition, CAT activity driven by the CRE-dependent promoter was inhibited in parental MeWo cells cotransfected with increasing concentrations of KCREB in a dose-dependent manner. We did not observe any changes in Bcl-2 or Bcl-2-related proteins (Bcl-x, Bax, and Bad) in control or KCREB-transfected cells before or after treatment with Tg.

The molecular basis of human malignant melanoma progression has remained largely unknown, despite the fact that the worldwide incidence of melanoma is increasing more than that of any other neoplastic disease (1Kopf, A. W., Salopek, T. G., Slade, J., Marghoob, A. A., and Bart, R. S. (1995) Cancer 75,(suppl.), 684–690Google Scholar). The development of malignant melanoma in humans progresses through a multistage process. The switches from melanocyte to nevi, to radial growth, and subsequently to vertical growth phase (metastatic phenotype) are associated with decreased dependence on growth factors, diminished anchorage dependence, and reduced contact inhibition (2Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6130-6138PubMed Google Scholar,3Lu C. Kerbel R.S. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1994; 6: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A large body of data concerning the molecular control of melanoma progression has come from studies using mitogens. In culture, melanocytes synergistically respond to a number of growth factors, which in combination with each other or with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or cAMP stimulate not only proliferation but also pigmentation (4Halaban R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 171-181PubMed Google Scholar). These growth factors include several fibroblast growth factors, hepatocyte growth factor, and stem cell factor (also known as KIT ligand, MGF, and steel factor), all of which stimulate receptors tyrosine kinase. As melanocyte proliferation and differentiation are positively regulated by agents that increase cAMP (5Halaban R. Pomerantz S.H. Marshall S. Lambert D.T. Lerner A.B. J.

The 43-kDa CREB, which binds the consensus motif 5′-TGACGTCA-3′ and activates transcription, was initially isolated from rat brain tissue (8Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M.

Oncog. 1992; 3: 321-338PubMed Google Scholar). CREB belongs to the leucine zipper class of proteins (10Borrelli E. Montmayeur J.P. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1992; 3: 321-338PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lanschultz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2547) Google Scholar). Certain leucine zipper family members can form heterodimers in specific combinations; however, the functional significance of this specific pairing is unknown. The carboxyl terminus of CREB contains a leucine zipper that is required for dimerization and DNA binding (12Vinson C.R. Sigler P. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). CREB also has a transactivation domain that contains several independent regions, including one identified as the kinase-inducible domain, which contains consensus phosphorylation sites for several kinases including protein kinase A (10Borrelli E. Montmayeur J.P. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1992; 3: 321-338PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, one mechanism of CREB transcriptional activation is phosphorylation of Ser-133 by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-activated protein kinase A (13Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1988; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Many other Ser/Thr kinases can phosphorylate CREB including protein kinase C (14Xie H. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1717-1723PubMed Google Scholar); Ca2+/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinases such as CaMKI, CaMKII (15Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar), and CaMKIV (16Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6107-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar); Ras-dependent p105 kinase (17Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), p90 (18Bohm M. Moellmann G. Cheng E. Alvarez-Franco M. Wagner S. Sassone-Corsi P. Halaban R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar), and Rsk 2 (19Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that phosphorylation events alter the conformation of the transactivation domain of CREB, enhancing its interaction with the transcriptional machinery (20Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that CREB expression correlates directly with the metastatic potential of murine melanoma cells (21Rutberg S.E. Goldstein I.M. Yang Y.M. Stackpole C.E. Ronai Z. Mol. Carcinogen. 1994; 10: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas the other CREB family transcription factor member ATF-1 is not detected in normal melanocytes but is easily found in metastatic melanoma cells (18Bohm M. Moellmann G. Cheng E. Alvarez-Franco M. Wagner S. Sassone-Corsi P. Halaban R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). Whether these observations are causally related to tumorigenicity and metastasis of melanoma cells was not yet clear. To study the contribution of the CREB transcription factor to tumor growth and metastasis of human melanoma cells, we have used a dominant-negative cDNA construct of CREB, KCREB, that had been mutated in the DNA-binding domain (22Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar). When overexpressed, this protein can quench factor(s) capable of associating with CREB. CREB-associated proteins include members of the ATF and AP-1 transcription factor families (23Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 24Wanda T. Watanabe H. Usuda Y. Handa H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 557-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Abdel-Malek Abdel-Hafiz H. Chen C.Y. Marcell T. Kroll D.J. Hoeffler J.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1161-1174PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the KCREB mutant would be expected to yield proper heterodimerization with CRE-binding proteins; however, because of the mutant's poor affinity to DNA, the associated proteins do not confer the same degree of transcriptional activity as they would in the case of the wild-type CREB. For example, previous studies using the KCREB construct in F9 teratocarcinoma and CA-77 thyroid carcinoma cells demonstrated its ability to block cAMP-induced transcription from the somatostatin promoter (22Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar, 26Woloshin P.I. Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Goodman R.H. Cone R.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1725-1733PubMed Google Scholar). We recently showed that the expression of the KCREB construct in metastatic MeWo melanoma cells decreased their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in nude mice (27Xie S.H. Price J.E. Luca M. Jean D. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2069-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The KCREB-transfected cells displayed a significant decrease in MMP-2 (72-kDa collagenase type IV) mRNA and activity that resulted in a decrease in invasiveness through the basement membrane, an important component of tumor invasion and metastasis. In addition, the cell-surface adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18, which is involved in the metastasis of human melanoma (28Lehmann J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 9891-9895Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 29Luca M. Hunt B. Bucana C.D. Johnson J.P. Fidler I.J. Bar-Eli M. Melanoma Res. 1993; 3: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30Xie S.H. Luca M. Huang S.Y. Gutman M. Reich R. Johnson J.P. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2295-2303PubMed Google Scholar), was down-regulated in the KCREB-transfected cells. Our results (27Xie S.H. Price J.E. Luca M. Jean D. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2069-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) indicated that, through their transcriptional activities, CREB and its associated proteins play an important role in the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype of human melanoma cells, possibly through regulation of MMP-2 and MCAM/MUC18 gene expression. However, as CREB mediates both cAMP and Ca2+transcriptional responses (13Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1988; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2064) Google Scholar, 15Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar), and as the induction of apoptosis by diverse exogenous signals depends on elevated intracellular Ca2+ (31McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Wyllie A.H. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 32McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), we studied here the role of CREB and its associated proteins in apoptosis. In the present study, we used thapsigargin (Tg), which inhibits endoplasmic reticulum-dependent Ca2+-ATPase and thereby increases cytosolic Ca2+ (33Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar), to induce apoptosis in parental and KCREB-transfected melanoma cells. We demonstrate that expression of KCREB in MeWo melanoma cells renders them susceptible to Tg-induced apoptosis. Treatment with Tg caused phosphorylation of CREB and possibly ATF-1 transcription factors and induced CRE-dependent transcription in parental cells. However, in the KCREB-transfected cells, CREB/ATF-1 and their associated proteins were quenched, as shown by lower CAT activity driven by the CRE-dependent somatostatin promoter after treatment with Tg as compared with control cells. We did not observe any changes in protein expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-2-related proteins (Bcl-x, Bax, and Bad) in the KCREB-transfected and control cells before and after treatment with Tg. Collectively, these results suggest that CREB and its associated proteins act as survival factors in human melanoma cells, thus providing an alternative mechanism by which dominant-negative CREB inhibits tumor growth and metastasis of human melanoma. The human melanoma MeWo cell line was established in culture from a lymph node metastasis of a melanoma patient (34Fogh J. Wright W. Loveless J.D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1977; 58: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided to us by Dr. S. Ferrone (New York Medical College, New York, NY). MeWo cells are tumorigenic and metastatic in nude mice (35Ishikawa M. Dennis J.W. Man S. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 665-670PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of MeWo melanoma cells with the pRSV-KCREB construct and the isolation of the two clones K-2 and K-10 that express KCREB were described previously (36Yang Y.M. Dolan L.R. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2223-2233PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in culture as adherent monolayers in RPMI, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit, Ft. Collins, CO), sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transfected cells MeWo-Neo, K-2, and K-10 (36Yang Y.M. Dolan L.R. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2223-2233PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in the same medium containing G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 200 μg/ml. All cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Antibodies anti-CREB and anti-p-CREB (antibody 5322) were a gift from Dr. Marc R. Montminy (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (37Hagiwara M. Brindle P. Harootunian A. Armstrong R. Rivier J. Vale W. Tsien R. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4852-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Antibody to ATF-1 (A1) was a gift of Dr. Michael R. Green (University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA) (38Liu F. Thompson M.A. Wagner S. Greenberg M.E. Green M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6714-6720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody to human Bcl-2 (clone 6C8) was provided by Dr. Timothy McDonnell (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). Polyclonal antibodies to Bcl-x (M1–25), Bad (K17), and Bax (N20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); antibody to β-actin was purchased from Sigma. Melanoma cells (5 × 105) were seeded onto 100-mm Petri dishes in culture medium without G418. Thapsigargin (1 μm) was added when cultures reached 70–80% cell confluence. All buffers used for the total and nuclear extracts contained protease and phosphatase inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 10 mm NaF. For total extract, cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in 250 μl of Triton lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA) for 20 min on ice. For nuclear extract, cells were scrapped off in cold PBS and washed once in the same buffer. The cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9 containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. After a 10-min incubation on ice, the cytoplasmic fraction was separated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 s at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Triton lysis buffer and incubated for 30 min on ice. For both extracts, the soluble proteins in the lysates were separated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The protein content was quantified using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Proteins of total cell extract (40 μg) and nuclear extract (20 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were washed in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 containing 150 mmNaCl) and blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were then probed overnight in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and relevant antibodies with a dilution of 1/5000 except for the antibody to ATF-1 (1/500). The membranes were then incubated with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit Ig, horseradish peroxidase-linked F(ab′)2 fragments (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)) with a dilution of 1/2000 in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. In the case of Bcl-2, an anti-hamster IgG was used (Sigma) before the horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody. Immunoreactive materials were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence per manufacturer's instructions (ECL detection system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The CRE-dependent plasmid (Somat-BglII) was obtained from Dr. Marc R. Montminy (Harvard Medical School). The Somat-BglII CAT construct contained the somatostatin gene promoter from -71 to +53 linked to the CAT reporter gene (39Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). pRSV-KCREB was kindly provided by Dr. Richard H. Goodman (Oregon Health Sciences, Portland, OR). pRSV-KCREB contained a full-length CREB cDNA with a single base pair substitution in the DNA-binding domain that causes a change from Arg287 to Leu (22Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar). In parallel, a pRc/RSV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) construct lacking CREB cDNA was used. Melanoma cells (1.5 × 105) were transfected with 3 μg of the basic CAT expression vector with no promoter/enhancer sequence (pCAT-Basic), a control plasmid with SV40 promoter and enhancer (pCAT-Control) from Promega (Madison, WI) or the Somat-BglII CAT construct using 20 μl of Lipofectin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). For cotransfection experiments, pRc/RSV and pRSV-KCREB plasmids were added in the indicated amounts to a total concentration of 6 μg. Fifty nanograms of pRL-CMV vector, which contained the cDNA encoding Renilla luciferase (Promega) was introduced in each experiment to correct for variations of transfection efficiency. After 5 h, the transfection medium was replaced with normal growth medium. Thapsigargin (1 μm) was added to the culture medium 24 h after transfection, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. The transfected cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, cell extracts were first assayed forRenilla luciferase activity using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Samples were normalized as the same relative luciferase activity and assayed for CAT activity (40Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts were incubated with 0.025 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol and 0.35 mmacetyl-coenzyme A in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, for 2 h at 37 °C. The nonacetylated and acetylated forms of chloramphenicol were extracted in ethyl acetate and separated by thin-layer chromatography with chloroform/methanol (95:5). The conversion of chloramphenicol to the acetylated form was quantified by scanning densitometry of an autoradiograph with a personal densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Each assay was repeated at least three times; there was less than 10% variation among individual transfections. Cells were plated overnight in the culture medium described above without G418 and incubated in the presence of 1 μm thapsigargin (Tg) or 1 μm staurosporine (St) for 24 or 48 h. All cells (including those that had detached and those remaining adherent) were collected and adherent cells were harvested in PBS containing 0.1% EDTA. Cells were washed twice with PBS; pelleted by centrifugation; resuspended in PBS containing 3 mm sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide; and incubated for 2–4 h. The propidium iodide -stained cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis on an EPICS Profile flow cytometer (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Results are reported as the average of at least three independent experiments. Melanoma cells were treated by Tg or St and collected as described above. Cells were fixed in a cacodylate buffer (0.1m) containing 3% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, washed, and treated with 0.1% tannic acid for 20 min. The samples were then incubated in 1% buffered osmium tetroxide for 1 h and stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h (41Muller H.K. Bucana C.D. Kripke M.L. Cox P.A. Saijo S. Strickland F.M. Cell Immunol. 1994; 157: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and then infiltrated and embedded in Spurr's low viscosity medium. The blocks were polymerized in a 60 °C oven overnight. Thin sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined using a Jeol 1200-EX transmission electron microscope (Jeol, Peabody, MA). We previously demonstrated that the transcription factor CREB and its associated proteins play an important role in the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype of human melanoma. Quenching of CREB and its associated proteins via the use of dominant-negative CREB (KCREB), which has been mutated within its DNA binding domain, led to a decrease in the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of metastatic MeWo melanoma cells in nude mice (27Xie S.H. Price J.E. Luca M. Jean D. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2069-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As CREB mediates both cAMP and Ca2+ transcriptional responses (13Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1988; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2064) Google Scholar, 15Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar), and as induction of apoptosis by diverse exogenous signals is dependent on elevation of intracellular Ca2+ (31McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Wyllie A.H. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 32McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), we decided to analyze if CREB and its associated proteins could be involved in the resistance of melanoma cells to apoptosis induction, hence contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. To study the involvement of CREB and its associated proteins in apoptosis, we used Tg, which inhibits endoplasmic reticulum-dependent Ca2+-ATPase and thereby increases cytosolic Ca2+ (33Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Previously, Yang et al. (36Yang Y.M. Dolan L.R. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2223-2233PubMed Google Scholar) have reported the selection and the characterization of the MeWo clones K-2 and K-10, which express the dominant-negative KCREB. We evaluated the ability of Tg to induce apoptosis in MeWo parental cells (MeWo-P), neo-transfected cells (MeWo-Neo), and the two KCREB-transfected clones K-2 and K-10 by propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis. Fig. 1 A shows the results of a representative experiment after 48 h of treatment with 1 μm Tg. The cells treated with Tg showed a hypodiploid DNA content indicative of apoptosis. The percentages of hypodiploid cells were higher in K-2 and K-10 cells (46.4% and 83.3%, respectively) than in MeWo-P and MeWo-Neo cells (20.5% and 20.2%, respectively). We used St, which strongly inhibits various kinases (including tyrosine kinases) and which induces apoptosis in most nucleated mammalian cells (42Ishizaki Y. Cheng L. Mudge A.W. Raff M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1443-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), to verify that the higher percentages of hypodiploid cells observed with the two KCREB-transfected clones was specific for Tg and increase of cytosolic Ca2+. The MeWo-P, MeWo-Neo, K-2, and K-10 cells treated with St for 48 h showed comparable hypodiploid DNA contents (87.8%, 88.9%, 86.6%, and 85.6%, respectively). Fig. 1 B summarizes the result of at least three independent FACS analyses of propidium iodide staining after 24 and 48 h of treatment with 1 μm Tg or 1 μm St. Only the K-2 and K-10 cells showed a hypodiploid DNA content indicative of apoptosis after 24 h of Tg treatment. The percentages of hypodiploid cells increased after 48 h of Tg treatment and were significantly higher in K-2 and K-10 cells by 2.2 and 3.3-fold, respectively, than in MeWo-P and MeWo-Neo cells. After 24 and 48 h of St treatment, the proportions of hypodiploid cells observed in MeWo-P, MeWo-Neo, K-2, and K-10 cells were not significantly different. These data demonstrate that Tg induced apoptosis in the two KCREB-transfected cells, whereas the control MeWo-P and MeWo-Neo cells were resistant to Tg-induced apoptosis. Agents that stimulate adenylate cyclase or cAMP analogs (such as forskolin and dibutyryl-cAMP) did not cause apoptosis in MeWo-P, MeWo-Neo, K-2, or K-10 cells (data not shown), indicating that Tg-induced apoptosis was mediated via the Ca2+ and not the cAMP pathway. Although DNA fragmentation is considered to be an excellent marker for apoptosis, there are reports of apoptosis without DNA fragmentation, particularly in studies with solid tumor cell lines. Because morphological alterations define the response, we investigated the effects of Tg and St on cellular morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to confirm the results obtained by propidium iodide-FACS analysis. Cells were exposed to 1 μm Tg or 1 μm St for 48 h and were examined by TEM. Fig. 2 A shows electron micrographs of cells (original magnification, ×1000). Cells with typical apoptotic morphology (plasma and nuclear membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, cytoplasmic vacuolarization) were identified among KCREB-transfected K-2 and K-10 cells treated with Tg. The K-10 clone showed higher sensibility to Tg-induced apoptosis than the K-2 clone, thus confirming the results obtained by FACS analysis after propidium iodide staining. Fig. 2 B represents electron micrographs of a single cell taken from MeWo-P, MeWo-Neo, K-2, and K-10 cells after treatment with 1 μm Tg for 48 h. K-2 and K-10 Tg-treated cells showed nuclear changes consistent with apoptosis (condensation and segregation of chromatin into compact masses aligning with the inner side of the nuclear membrane). In contrast, most of the MeWo-P and MeWo-Neo cells did not display these changes (Fig. 2,A and B). Treatment with St caused equivalent levels of apoptosis in all cells tested. The expression of dominant-negative KCREB did not modify the sensitivity of MeWo cells to St-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these results demonstrated that KCREB-transfected cells were more sensitive to Tg-induced apoptosis than were parental or control neo-transfected cells. The higher susceptibility of K-10 cells to Tg-induced apoptosis as compared with K-2 cells could be explained by higher KCREB activity in these cells (27Xie S.H. Price J.E. Luca M. Jean D. Ronai"

Cells have developed mechanisms for the repair of chromosomal DNA breaks that can be generated either randomly (e.g. by ionizing radiation) or site-specifically during V(D)J recombination. Two distinct DNA double-strand break repair pathways are operative in eukaryotic cells: homologous recombination, which employs stretches of homologous DNA to replace a region containing a DNA double-strand break. The second pathway, nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ),1 allows cells to directly religate a broken chromosome.The latter mechanism is an integral part of the DNA end-joining phase in V(D)J recombination, the mechanism that assembles coding regions for the variable domains of immunoglobulin and T cell receptors in developing lymphocytes (1Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3120) Google Scholar). The DNA double-strand breaks in this process are generated by two lymphoid-specific proteins, RAG-1 and RAG-2 (2Schatz D.G. Oettinger M.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 59: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 3Oettinger M.A. Schatz D.G. Gorka C. Baltimore D.

Cleavage of DNA by RAG proteins is followed by a DNA end-joining phase involving many activities that are also essential for general NHEJ. This is evidenced by a variety of mutations resulting in increased x-ray sensitivity as well as a defect in V(D)J recombination.One example is the scid mutation in mice that results in hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation as well as a severe combined immunodeficiency (5Bosma G.C.

This cDNA is able to complement the DNA repair defect in the Chinese hamster ovary cell line XR-1 carrying a deletion of theXRCC4 gene.

Together with the finding that the yeast homologue of DNA ligase IV is essential for nonhomologous DNA end-joining (19Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R.

West R.B. Lieber M.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, it has been suggested that DNA ligase I and not IV is involved in V(D)J recombination, as only DNA ligase I has been found to stimulate signal and coding joint formation in an in vitro assay (23Ramsden D.A. Paull T.T. Gellert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).To test the significance of the XRCC4-DNA ligase IV interaction for nonhomologous DNA repair and V(D)J recombination in vivo, we have generated a series of XRCC4 deletion mutants. The XRCC4 mutants were assayed for their ability to associate with DNA ligase IV in vitro, and stable transfectants of these mutants were analyzed for their V(D)J recombination and DNA repair phenotypes.DISCUSSIONWe and others have recently demonstrated that the DNA repair protein XRCC4 forms a complex with DNA ligase IV (17Grawunder U.

Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that DNA ligase IV is involved in nonhomologous DNA end-joining in mammalian cells. This notion is supported by the finding that the Saccharomyces cerevisiaeDNA ligase IV homologue is an essential component for NHEJ in yeast cells (19Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 20Schär P. Hermann G. Daly G. Lindahl T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1912-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Teo S.H. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4788-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, using a cell-free in vitro V(D)J recombination assay, it has been demonstrated that DNA ligase I and not IV was able to stimulate signal and coding joint formation, leaving it controversial which of the known mammalian DNA ligases might be essential for this process (23Ramsden D.A. Paull T.T. Gellert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).To test the physiologic significance of the XRCC4·DNA ligase IV complex for NHEJ and V(D)J recombination, we have created a set of XRCC4 deletion mutants that were analyzed for their ability to interact with DNA ligase IV in vitro as well as for their capacity to reconstitute wild-type DNA repair and V(D)J recombination upon stable expression in vivo. We find a correlation between the inability of XRCC4 deletion mutants to associate with DNA ligase IV and a failure of these mutants to reconstitute wild-type DNA repair or V(D)J recombination in cells. In addition, two of the four XRCC4 deletion mutants that were able to associate with DNA ligase IV reconstituted the DNA repair and V(D)J recombination defect of XR-1 cells back to wild-type levels. It cannot be excluded that deletions, which disrupt binding to DNA ligase IV, might also affect some unidentified DNA repair functions of XRCC4. However, we consider the correlation between the ability or inability to interact with DNA ligase IV and the ability or failure to reconstitute wild-type DNA repair, respectively, compelling and suggest that a physical interaction of XRCC4 with DNA ligase IV is required for both NHEJ and V(D)J recombination in mammalian cells. As an extension from this we conclude that DNA ligase IV is essential for both of these processes and that it cannot function without its co-factor XRCC4.At this point, we do not have an explanation why XRCC4 deletion mutants X4Δ1 and X4Δ2 failed to reconstitute wild-type DNA repair upon stable transfection in XR-1 cells despite their ability to associate with DNA ligase IV. For one, it is possible that the approximately 10-fold lower XRCC4 expression levels in stable transfections of these mutants were not sufficient to reconstitute wild-type DNA repair function. Furthermore, mutant X4Δ2 does not properly localize to the nucleus, which might affect function of this XRCC4 deletion mutant. However, loss of nuclear localization at high expression levels, as seen for mutant X4Δ6, did not interfere with the reconstitution of a wild-type phenotype, arguing that improper nuclear localization can potentially be compensated by high expression levels.The fact that XRCC4 deletion mutant X4Δ1 localizes to the nucleus is able to bind DNA ligase IV but fails to confer a wild-type DNA repair phenotype suggests that XRCC4 exhibits functions beyond binding to DNA ligase IV (17Grawunder U.

However, our data indicate that XRCC4 deletion mutant X4Δ1 can stimulate DNA ligase IV, although with a slightly decreased efficiency compared with that of all other mutants that bind DNA ligase IV.Our study is in good agreement with recently published data showing that a core region of XRCC4 from amino acid position 18 to 204 is required for its in vivo function (31Leber R.

Cheng H.L. Gao Y. Alt F.W. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether homodimerization of XRCC4 is a prerequisite for the association with DNA ligase IV.We and others have demonstrated that the S. cerevisiaehomologue of DNA ligase IV is essential for NHEJ in yeast, and it was hypothesized that mammalian DNA ligase IV is therefore also involved in NHEJ and V(D)J recombination.

The latter finding is also in conflict with data demonstrating that V(D)J recombination has been found to occur normally in DNA ligase I-deficient cell lines (33Petrini J.H.J. Donovan J.W. Dimare C. Weaver D.T. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 176-183PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hsieh C.L. Arlett C.F. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20105-20109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Further studies are needed to define the precise physiologic role of the XRCC4·DNA ligase IV complex for DNA repair and V(D)J recombination. However, the correlation between the ability or inability of XRCC4 mutants to bind DNA ligase IV with the respective ability or failure to reconstitute DNA repair and V(D)J recombination provides the strongest in vivo data, to date, that the physical association of XRCC4 with DNA ligase IV is essential for both processes. Cells have developed mechanisms for the repair of chromosomal DNA breaks that can be generated either randomly (e.g. by ionizing radiation) or site-specifically during V(D)J recombination. Two distinct DNA double-strand break repair pathways are operative in eukaryotic cells: homologous recombination, which employs stretches of homologous DNA to replace a region containing a DNA double-strand break. The second pathway, nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ),1 allows cells to directly religate a broken chromosome. The latter mechanism is an integral part of the DNA end-joining phase in V(D)J recombination, the mechanism that assembles coding regions for the variable domains of immunoglobulin and T cell receptors in developing lymphocytes (1Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3120) Google Scholar). The DNA double-strand breaks in this process are generated by two lymphoid-specific proteins, RAG-1 and RAG-2 (2Schatz D.G. Oettinger M.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 59: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 3Oettinger M.A. Schatz D.G. Gorka C. Baltimore D. Science. 1990; 248: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar), that cleave DNA at conserved recombination signal sequences flanking all V (variable), D (diversity), and J (joining) gene segments (4McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M. Oettinger M.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 387-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Cleavage of DNA by RAG proteins is followed by a DNA end-joining phase involving many activities that are also essential for general NHEJ. This is evidenced by a variety of mutations resulting in increased x-ray sensitivity as well as a defect in V(D)J recombination. One example is the scid mutation in mice that results in hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation as well as a severe combined immunodeficiency (5Bosma G.C. Custer R.P. Bosma M.J. Nature. 1983; 301: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). Scid cells carry a mutation in DNA-dependent protein kinase affecting its kinase activity (6Blunt T. Finnie N.J. Taccioli G.E.

However, the correlation between the ability or inability of XRCC4 mutants to bind DNA ligase IV with the respective ability or failure to reconstitute DNA repair and V(D)J recombination provides the strongest in vivo data, to date, that the physical association of XRCC4 with DNA ligase IV is essential for both processes. We and others have recently demonstrated that the DNA repair protein XRCC4 forms a complex with DNA ligase IV (17Grawunder U. Wilm M. Wu X. Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 18Critchlow S.E. Bowater R.P. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 588-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and that complex formation stimulates DNA ligase IV activity in vitro(17Grawunder U. Wilm M. Wu X. Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that DNA ligase IV is involved in nonhomologous DNA end-joining in mammalian cells. This notion is supported by the finding that the Saccharomyces cerevisiaeDNA ligase IV homologue is an essential component for NHEJ in yeast cells (19Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 20Schär P. Hermann G. Daly G. Lindahl T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1912-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Teo S.H. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4788-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, using a cell-free in vitro V(D)J recombination assay, it has been demonstrated that DNA ligase I and not IV was able to stimulate signal and coding joint formation, leaving it controversial which of the known mammalian DNA ligases might be essential for this process (23Ramsden D.A. Paull T.T. Gellert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To test the physiologic significance of the XRCC4·DNA ligase IV complex for NHEJ and V(D)J recombination, we have created a set of XRCC4 deletion mutants that were analyzed for their ability to interact with DNA ligase IV in vitro as well as for their capacity to reconstitute wild-type DNA repair and V(D)J recombination upon stable expression in vivo. We find a correlation between the inability of XRCC4 deletion mutants to associate with DNA ligase IV and a failure of these mutants to reconstitute wild-type DNA repair or V(D)J recombination in cells. In addition, two of the four XRCC4 deletion mutants that were able to associate with DNA ligase IV reconstituted the DNA repair and V(D)J recombination defect of XR-1 cells back to wild-type levels. It cannot be excluded that deletions, which disrupt binding to DNA ligase IV, might also affect some unidentified DNA repair functions of XRCC4. However, we consider the correlation between the ability or inability to interact with DNA ligase IV and the ability or failure to reconstitute wild-type DNA repair, respectively, compelling and suggest that a physical interaction of XRCC4 with DNA ligase IV is required for both NHEJ and V(D)J recombination in mammalian cells. As an extension from this we conclude that DNA ligase IV is essential for both of these processes and that it cannot function without its co-factor XRCC4. At this point, we do not have an explanation why XRCC4 deletion mutants X4Δ1 and X4Δ2 failed to reconstitute wild-type DNA repair upon stable transfection in XR-1 cells despite their ability to associate with DNA ligase IV. For one, it is possible that the approximately 10-fold lower XRCC4 expression levels in stable transfections of these mutants were not sufficient to reconstitute wild-type DNA repair function. Furthermore, mutant X4Δ2 does not properly localize to the nucleus, which might affect function of this XRCC4 deletion mutant. However, loss of nuclear localization at high expression levels, as seen for mutant X4Δ6, did not interfere with the reconstitution of a wild-type phenotype, arguing that improper nuclear localization can potentially be compensated by high expression levels. The fact that XRCC4 deletion mutant X4Δ1 localizes to the nucleus is able to bind DNA ligase IV but fails to confer a wild-type DNA repair phenotype suggests that XRCC4 exhibits functions beyond binding to DNA ligase IV (17Grawunder U. Wilm M. Wu X. Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 31Leber R. Wise T.W. Mizuta R. Meek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1794-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). One of the possibilities is a failure to properly stimulate DNA ligase IV activity. However, our data indicate that XRCC4 deletion mutant X4Δ1 can stimulate DNA ligase IV, although with a slightly decreased efficiency compared with that of all other mutants that bind DNA ligase IV. Our study is in good agreement with recently published data showing that a core region of XRCC4 from amino acid position 18 to 204 is required for its in vivo function (31Leber R. Wise T.W. Mizuta R. Meek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1794-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Mizuta R. Cheng H.L. Gao Y. Alt F.W. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that XRCC4 forms homodimers (31Leber R. Wise T.W. Mizuta R. Meek K. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1997; 9: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and that the region required for homodimerization overlaps with the region that is essential for DNA ligase IV binding (32Mizuta R. Cheng H.L. Gao Y. Alt F.W. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether homodimerization of XRCC4 is a prerequisite for the association with DNA ligase IV. We and others have demonstrated that the S. cerevisiaehomologue of DNA ligase IV is essential for NHEJ in yeast, and it was hypothesized that mammalian DNA ligase IV is therefore also involved in NHEJ and V(D)J recombination. This notion is in apparent contrast to a study demonstrating a role of DNA ligase I and not IV for signal and coding joint formation using a cell-free in vitro V(D)J recombination system (23Ramsden D.A. Paull T.T. Gellert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The latter finding is also in conflict with data demonstrating that V(D)J recombination has been found to occur normally in DNA ligase I-deficient cell lines (33Petrini J.H.J. Donovan J.W. Dimare C.

https://openalex.org/W2039767353,"Caspases are cysteine proteases that play an essential role in apoptosis by cleaving several key cellular proteins. Despite their function in apoptosis, little is known about where in the cell they are localized and whether they are translocated to specific cellular compartments upon activation. In the present paper, usingAequorea victoria green fluorescent protein fusion constructs, we have determined the localization of Nedd2 (mouse caspase-2) and show that both precursor and processed caspase-2 localize to the cytoplasmic and the nuclear compartments. We demonstrate that the nuclear localization of caspase-2 is strictly dependent on the presence of the prodomain. A caspase-2 prodomain-green fluorescent protein localized to dot- and fiber-like structures mostly in the nucleus, whereas a protein lacking the prodomain was largely concentrated in the cytoplasm. We also show that an amino-terminal fusion of the prodomain of caspase-2 to caspase-3 mediates nuclear transport of caspase-3, which is normally localized in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that, in addition to roles in dimerization and recruitment through adaptors, the caspase-2 prodomain has a novel function in nuclear transport."

Mutational conversion of the EGFR sequence 1171–1176 AEYLRV into the high affinity SHP-1 binding sequence LEYLYL of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) led to a highly elevated SHP-1 binding to the mutant EGFR (EGFR1171–1176EpoR) and in turn to an enhanced dephosphorylation of the receptor. SHP-1 expression interfered with EGF-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase stimulation, and this effect was more pronounced in case of EGFR1171–1176EpoR.

In case of the EpoR, SHP-1 is recruited via its N-terminal SH2 domain to the receptor subsequent to EpoR phosphorylation by Jak2 kinase (17Klingmüller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). A high affinity SHP-1 binding site at Tyr-429 of EpoR has been characterized, and its lack in respective YF mutants of EpoR or truncated receptors leads to an enhanced EpoR signaling activity (17Klingmüller U.

Thus, SHP-1 may negatively regulate HER family receptor signaling in epithelial cells. Both SH2 domains of SHP-1 are important for binding of SHP-1 to the EGFR and for receptor dephosphorylation, although the N-terminal SH2 domain contributes to a larger extent to the interaction (35Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B. Stein-Gerlach M. Lammers R. Krivtsov A.V. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.-D. J. Biol.

The catalytic domain of SHP-1 provides the specificity for EGFR dephosphorylation and cannot be replaced by the catalytic domain of SHP-2 in SHP-1/SHP-2 chimeras (35Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S.

To further clarify the mechanism of SHP-1 EGFR interaction, we investigated the importance of different EGFR autophosphorylation sites for the interaction with SHP-1. Activation of purified recombinant SHP-1 by EGFR sequence-derived phosphopeptides, competition of phosphopeptides with binding of autophosphorylated EGFR to immobilized SHP-1 SH2 domains, and binding of SHP-1 to a panel of EGFR YF mutants was employed to identify Tyr(P)1173 as the main binding site for SHP-1 on the EGFR. Introduction of the EpoR high affinity SHP-1 binding site into the EGFR strongly increases SHP-1 binding and also increases receptor dephosphorylation by SHP-1. Introduction of a Y1173F mutation reduces but does not abrogate receptor dephosphorylation by coexpressed SHP-1. Thus, SHP-1 activity toward EGFR is modulated but not exclusively dependent on receptor binding. EGF was purchased from Pepro Tech, Inc., (Rocky Hill, NJ).

The modified SHP-1 DNA was removed from pBKS using EcoRI/NotI and cloned in pGEX-5X-1. To clone the SH2 domains only, anEcoRI/SmaI fragment of modified SHP-1 was cloned into pGEX-5X-1. The SHP-1 SH2 domain point mutants with inactivated N-terminal SH2 domain (R32K), with inactivated C-terminal SH2 domain (R138K), or both inactivated SH2 domains (R32K, R138K) were subcloned from the corresponding full-length DNAs in pRK5 (35Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B. Stein-Gerlach M. Lammers R. Krivtsov A.V. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.-D. J. Biol.

A single colony was inoculated into 50 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and cultured overnight. 25 ml of this overnight culture were added to 500 ml of LB/ampicillin and grown at 37 °C to A 600nm = 0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the bacteria were kept for 16 h at 25 °C under shaking. Thereafter, the bacteria were pelleted at 6,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml bestatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was three times frozen and thawed, lysozyme was added (0.5 mg/ml final concentration), and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. Subsequently EDTA and Triton X-100 were added in final concentrations of 20 mmand 0.5%, respectively, and the mixture was incubated again for 20 min at 25 °C. The bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 ×g and 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh 15-ml polypropylene tube containing 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This suspension was mixed by end-over-end rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted at 1000 × g and 4 °C for 1 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The beads were washed 4 × 10 min at 4 °C each time with 10 ml of buffer W1 (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7, 5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100) and 1× with buffer W2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The bound GST fusion proteins were eluted with 1 ml of buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm reduced glutathione) with end-over-end rotation for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g and 4 °C for 1 min, and the supernatant was collected. This elution step was repeated twice, and the supernatants were combined (3 ml). The eluate was dialyzed against Xa buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method. To remove the GST tag, GST-SHP-1 was digested with Factor Xa. For this the protein concentration of the fusion protein was adjusted to 1 mg/ml using Xa buffer, and Factor Xa was added with a ratio of protease:fusion protein of 1:200. The mixture was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The proteolytic reaction was stopped by adding 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 μmdansyl-l-glutamyl-glycyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone (final concentrations). The mixture was applied to a 1-ml glutathione-Sepharose 4B column equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm dithiothreitol) to remove free GST and uncleaved fusion protein. The unbound proteins were eluted with buffer A by collecting 250 μl fractions. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The positive fractions were combined and loaded on a MonoQ HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (80–200 mm within 20 ml). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Positive fractions were pooled and concentrated using 10-kDa centrifugal filters (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). 20% glycerol was added, and the protein solution was stored at −70 °C. The purity of the preparation was 95%; 300 μg of SHP-1 could be obtained from a 500-ml bacterial culture. A431 cells were grown in 94-mm dishes to about 70% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were starved for 16 h using serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and subsequently stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min and lysed in 700 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysates were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min. To investigate whether the interaction of SHP-1 and EGFR is direct or not, a sequential immuno- and affinity precipitation approach was used (37Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A431 cell lysates were prepared as described above. EGFR was immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody 425. The precipitates were denatured in 100 μl of SI buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min at 95 °C. 100 μl of denatured protein solution was mixed with 900 μl of lysis buffer. The partially renatured proteins were incubated with 50 μg of immobilized GST-SHP-1 or GST for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with HNGT (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4), 60 μl 2× Laemmli buffer was added, and the beads were boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and bound proteins were visualized by immunoblotting. Six peptides encompassing the following EGFR sequences, PQRY954LVIQGD, DADEY992LIPQQGFF, VPEY1068INQSVPK, NPVY1086HNQPLN, NPDY1148QQDFFPK, NAEY1173LRVAPQS, were synthesized using Fmoc chemistry on an ABI 433 synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and established procedures in solid phase peptide chemistry (38Stewart J.M. Young J.D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. Pierce, Rockford, IL1984Google Scholar, 39Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). We synthesized each peptide with and without phosphorylation of tyrosine using either Fmoc-Tyr(PO3H2)-OH (Novabiochem) or Fmoc-Tyr(t-butyl)-OH (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The peptides were initially purified on a SMART chromatographic system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using an reverse phase column C2/C18 Sephacil 2.1/10 column in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% acetonitrile with a gradient of 0–100% acetonitrile in 60 min at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The phosphopeptides were further purified by chelating chromatography (40Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and subsequently desalted using C18 Sep-Pak Cartridges (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). The eluted phosphopeptides were dried in a vacuum concentrator and redissolved in water. The phosphopeptide concentrations were determined by complete dephosphorylation using GST-SHP-1 and determination of released inorganic phosphate (41Heinonen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The sequences and the purity of the peptides were verified by complete N-terminal protein sequencing using an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 4-cartridge sequencer and by mass spectroscopy using a LCQ Finnigan MAT ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) coupled with an on-line Hewlett-Packard 1090 high performance liquid chromatography. 1 mg of each peptide was dissolved in 1 ml of water, and 1 μl was injected onto the high performance liquid chromatograph and eluted with an isocratic gradient of 50% methyl alcohol, 1% formic acid at flow rate of 200 μl/min. Activation of SHP-1 by EGFR-related phosphopeptides was carried out in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing the reaction buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7, 4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate), 200 μm phosphopeptides, and 500 ng of SHP-1. After 30 min at 25 °C, the reactions were quenched with 100 μl of 1n NaOH, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured. Controls with unphosphorylated peptides were carried out in the same way. Solubilized A431 membranes were prepared as described earlier (15Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Imyanitov E. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21277-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For 15 binding reactions, the following mixture was prepared: 100 μl of solubilized membranes (25 μg of protein) in buffer S (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100) were supplemented with 3 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 2 μg/ml EGF (final concentrations). This reaction was incubated on ice for 20 min. Autophosphorylation was started by adding 100 μm ATP and 38 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After a 5-min incubation on ice, the reaction mixture was applied onto a 0.5-ml WGA-agarose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with WGA buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.1% Triton X-100). The column was washed with 3 ml of WGA buffer. The radioactively labeled EGFR was eluted with 2 ml of WGA buffer containing 0.3 mn-acetylglucosamine, 100-μl fractions were collected, and aliquots were analyzed by scintillation counting. The peak fractions were pooled (500 μl). 50 μg of GST-fused SHP-1 SH2 domains (GST-SH2) were coupled to 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads per reaction. 30 μl of the radiolabeled EGFR (∼20, 000 cpm) supplemented with 200 μm phosphopeptides or the unphosphorylated analogues were added to the immobilized GST-SH2. The binding reactions were incubated with shaking for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed three times with HNGT, 60 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer was added, and the samples were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C. The extracted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (7.5% gels), and the gels were analyzed using a GS250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Point mutations were introduced into the EGFR cDNA using a M13 mutagenesis kit according to the manual of the supplier. 293 cells were transfected with the various EGFR mutants using calcium phosphate coprecipitation (15Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Imyanitov E. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21277-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 20 μg of plasmid DNA was used for one 94-mm dish. After transfection, the cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. Stimulation was stopped by removing the medium and lysis in 700-μl lysis buffer. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 25,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min. Protein amounts were determined using the Bradford method, and the different lysates were diluted to the same protein concentration with lysis buffer. To monitor the binding of the EGFR mutants to SHP-1, 10 μg of GST-SH2 or GST were coupled to 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. The lysates were incubated with the immobilized fusion proteins for 2 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The beads were washed three times with HNGT, and 60 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer was added. Noncovalently bound proteins were extracted by boiling the beads for 5 min, and the supernatants were loaded onto a 7.5% SDS gel. Immunoblotting was performed as described earlier (35Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B. Stein-Gerlach M. Lammers R. Krivtsov A.V. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5966-5973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The bound EGFR was visualized using anti-EGFR antibodies. Cotransfections of the EGFR mutants with SHP-1 were performed as described (35Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B. Stein-Gerlach M. Lammers R. Krivtsov A.V. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.-D. J. Biol.

The cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer/well of a 6-well plate. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described (35Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S.

The difference of the tyrosine phosphorylation level of a given EGFR mutant in the absence or presence of SHP-1 was used as measure of dephosphorylation activity toward the receptor. MAP kinase activity assayin vitro was performed as described (42Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293 cells were cotransfected with 0.25 μg of pcDNA3 HA extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, 0.5 μg of pRK5 EGFR wild type or mutants and 3.25 μg of pRK5 SHP-1 or intact vector. The cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min or left unstimulated. Thereafter, cells were lysed, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody. The kinase reaction was started by the addition of 1.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein, 75 μm ATP, 7.5 mm MgCl2 (final concentrations), and 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gels), and the lower part of the gels containing the phosphorylated myelin basic protein were dried and analyzed using a GS250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). The amount of immunoprecipitated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 was determined by blotting the upper part of the gel and development with anti-HA antibodies. Signaling molecules possessing"

A currently accepted model for proteasomal degradation of secretory proteins is retrograde translocation of the substrate polypeptides from the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) back to the cytosol. In this report, we present evidence that newly synthesized apoB becomes exposed to the cytosol and targeted to the proteasomes in a co-translational manner. Thus, after protein translation was synchronized with puromycin, partially synthesized apoB polypeptides were found to be conjugated to ubiquitin. The magnitude of co-translational ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of apoB was increased when cells were pretreated with either herbimycin A to induce cytosolic Hsp70 or with an inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; both treatments impede translocation of nascent apoB across the ER membrane. These treatments also decreased secretion of apoB and increased its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We suggest that translocation arrest with subsequent co-translational exposure to the cytosol provides an alternative model to explain how mammalian secretory proteins can overcome topological segregation by the ER membrane and undergo degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 is the site of synthesis of secretory and membrane proteins. Proteins targeted for secretion ordinarily undergo efficient cotranslational translocation across the ER membrane (1Corsi A.K. Schekman R. J. Biol.

ER quality control mechanisms ensure that only correctly folded, fully assembled or oligomerized proteins are deployed to distal cellular compartments; proteins failing to acquire their natural conformation are retained in the ER and subsequently degraded (3Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). This “ER degradation” has long been assumed to occur inside the ER lumen (4Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Ciechanover A.J. Schwartz A.L. Cellular Proteolytic Systems. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 135-160Google Scholar). Emerging evidence, however, indicates that degradation of aberrant ER luminal proteins is mediated by the cytosolic proteasome (5Bonifacino J.S.

Additionally, certain ER proteins with a transmembrane topology, such as the plasma membrane T-cell receptor (4Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Ciechanover A.J. Schwartz A.L.

Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), have also been reported to undergo proteasomal degradation. Cytosolic degradation has been observed with a wild-type hepatic secretory protein, apolipoprotein B100 (apoB) (17Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L.

ApoB is the major protein component of atherogenic plasma very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins (19Davis R.A. Subcell.

Regulation of the assembly and secretion of apoB-lipoproteins is predominately a post-translational event involving both recruitment of lipid ligands for lipoprotein formation/secretion and controlled degradation in a pre-Golgi compartment (21Dixon J.L.

Recently, newly synthesized apoB was demonstrated to undergo degradation mediated by the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: apoB was found in a ubiquitin-conjugated state, and its intracellular degradation could be prevented by proteasome-specific inhibitors, such as MG115 (17Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We extended that initial finding and demonstrated that the degree of proteasomal degradation appeared to be regulated by the availability of the lipid ligands for apoB (18Fisher E.A. Zhou M.

For proteins to be degraded by the 26 S proteasome pathway, conjugation with ubiquitin appears to be both an obligatory and rate-limiting process (24Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). We felt it was crucial, therefore, to determine how ubiquitination of apoB was regulated. Our hypothesis was that inefficient translocation of apoB across the ER membrane results in exposure of domains of apoB to the cytosol and subsequent ubiquitination.

[35S]methionine/cysteine was used at a concentration of 100 μCi/ml and was purchased from NEN Life Science Products as EXPRESSTM Protein Labeling Mix (specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol). Herbimycin A (HA) and puromycin were from Sigma and used at a final concentration of 1.0 μg/ml and 10 μm, respectively (18Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L.

All tissue culture supplies and other chemicals were obtained from suppliers as described previously (21Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded into collagen-precoated dishes or six-well tissue culture plates and grown in complete medium containing minimum essential medium (MEM) with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mmsodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were fed fresh complete medium every 3 days and maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines stably expressing 16% of the NH2 terminus of human apoB cDNA (CHO-B16) and 50% of the NH2 terminus of human apoB cDNA (CHO-B50) (27Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L-S.

All experiments were performed using exponentially growing cells at 90–95% confluence. Transient transfection of HepG2 cells with Hsp72 cDNA was carried out with Transfectam (Promega) as described previously (18Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L.

For synchronization of protein translation, cells were pretreated for 5 min with serum-free MEM containing 10 μm of puromycin at 37 °C. The plates were then put on ice, and cells were washed three times with ice-cold MEM to remove the puromycin. The cells were then transferred to a 37 °C for radiolabeling as described in the legend to Fig. 6. HepG2 cells were preincubated in serum-free MEM and then radiolabeled with either [3H]leucine in a serum-free, leucine-free medium or with Tran35S-label in a methionine-free, cysteine-free medium. Preincubation and labeling media each contained either 1.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) alone, or BSA plus other reagents as indicated in the figure legends (18Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). At the indicated time points, cells were removed from the 37 °C incubator and placed on ice for immediate cell lysis or changed into conditioned medium for chase as indicated by the individual figure legends. For cell lysis, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and lysed with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and proteinase inhibitors (2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml ALLN, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After a 30-min incubation with lysis buffer at 4 °C, the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 5 min, and the supernatants containing equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity were used for immunoprecipitations with the standard protocols in this laboratory (21Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes were mixed with sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatants were aliquoted for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were subjected to fluorography. Sequential immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (18Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We had previously demonstrated that nascent apoB interacts with a cytosolic molecular chaperone, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) (27Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L-S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25220-25224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a protein that facilitates ubiquitination of certain proteins (29Bercovich B. Stancovski I. Mayer A. Blumenfeld N. Laszlo A. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 30Hayes S.A. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Further studies had shown that when cell Hsp70 levels were increased either by HA treatment or Hsp70 cDNA transfection, apoB degradation by the proteasome was increased (18Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Our first experiment, therefore, was to determine if increased levels of Hsp70 could increase ubiquitination of apoB. Fig. 1 shows that when HepG2 cells were treated with HA for 4 h, Hsp70 levels increased markedly (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3and 4). This was associated with decreased apoB secretion into the medium (Fig. 1 B, lane 3), which was reversed by co-treatment with lactacystin (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). This result suggested that the decreased apoB secretion resulted from increased proteasomal degradation. ApoB levels in the cell lysates were also decreased in the HA-treated cells (Fig. 1 C, lane 3), and this was reversed by lactacystin co-treatment as well (Fig. 1 C, lane 4). Assessment of apoB ubiquitination was carried out with sequential immunoprecipitation (IP) (anti-apoB immunoprecipitation followed by anti-ubiquitin immunoprecipitation) (18Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The results represented in Fig. 1 D indicate that HA treatment increased the proportion of ubiquitinated apoB relative to total cell apoB in comparison with that of control cells (Fig. 1 D, lane 3 versus lane 1, using panel C, lanes 3 and 1, to normalize for total cell apoB). In particular, the amount of very high molecular weight ubiquitinated apoB conjugates was markedly increased by HA treatment. These effects of HA are even more striking when one considers that total cell apoB was reduced by HA treatment. The ability of HA treatment to increase apoB ubiquitination was even more pronounced when cells were treated with HA in the presence of lactacystin (Fig. 1 D, lane 4 versus lane 2). Since proteasome inhibition by lactacystin blocks the degradation of the ubiquitin-tagged apoB by the 26 S proteasome (18Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), maximum accumulation of apoB that had been conjugated to ubiquitin would be expected in cells treated with both HA and lactacystin. The result in lane 4 strengthens our speculation that HA treatment increases apoB degradation by stimulating apoB ubiquitination. To determine directly that the effects of HA on apoB degradation were specifically linked to increases in Hsp70, we next determined steady-state levels of ubiquitinated apoB following transient transfection of HepG2 cells with hsp70 cDNA (18Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that Hsp70 overexpression was associated with ubiquitination of a greater proportion of apoB molecules. Thus, similar amounts of ubiquitinated apoB are present in hsp70 cDNA- and mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 3 and 1) despite the presence of significantly decreased total cellular apoB in Hsp70-transfected cells (Fig. 2 B, compare lane 3 with lane 1). In the presence of lactacystin, the accumulation of ubiquitinated apoB was further increased in the Hsp70-transfected cells. Lactacystin treatment of Hsp70-transfected cells was also associated with the appearance of high molecular weight forms of ubiquitinated apoB (Fig. 2 A, lane 4), which were barely detectable under control and lactacystin-alone conditions (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 3). Overall, these results indicated that increased levels of Hsp70 stimulated apoB ubiquitination as a result, we believe, of inhibiting apoB translocation across the ER membrane. To further investigate the relationship between apoB translocation and ubiquitination, we conducted the following experiments. First, we were guided by the observation that carboxyl-truncated apoB containing approximately 50% of apoB100 does not undergo lipoprotein assembly and secretion after transfection into CHO cells (19Davis R.A. Subcell. Biochem. 1993; 21: 169-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 31Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S. Humiston P. Davis R.A J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1309-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation of nascent apoB50 across the ER membrane appears to be inhibited at the point where the lipid-binding β1-sheet domain of the polypeptide (which extends from approximately apoB18 to apoB46) (33Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) would be predicted to enter the translocon in the ER membrane (31Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S. Humiston P. Davis R.A J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Du E.Z. Wang S.L. Karyden H.J. Sokol R. Curtiss L.K. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1309-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, apoB16, which contains no lipid-binding β1-sheet domains (33Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), is efficiently translocated across the ER membrane and secreted as a lipid-free polypeptide (31Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S. Humiston P. Davis R.A J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Du E.Z. Wang S.L. Karyden H.J. Sokol R. Curtiss L.K. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1309-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB16 does not interact with cytosolic Hsp70, whereas apoB50 does (27Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L-S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25220-25224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In order to determine if inefficient translocation of apoB can predispose it to ubiquitination, we determined the ubiquitination status of apoB16 and apoB50 that were stably expressed in CHO cells (27Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L-S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25220-25224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that apoB16, depicted as an 85-kDa band in both the cell lysate (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) and the medium (Fig. 3 B, lane 1), was minimally ubiquitinated in the cells (Fig. 3 C, lane 1). In contrast, apoB50, which showed a 250-kDa band plus some aggregates and fragments in the cell lysate (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), displayed minimal, if any, secretion into the medium but was heavily ubiquitinated in the cells (Fig. 3, B and C, lane 2). Thus, translocation arrest and subsequent trapping in the ER membrane can render apoB susceptible to ubiquitination. Second, we exploited the effects of MTP on apoB translocation and degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. MTP expression is restricted to cells of hepatic and intestinal origin, and assembly of apoB into lipoprotein particles in these organs requires functional MTP activity (34Wetteau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.E. Eisenberg C. Munk A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Rader D.J. Greeg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). MTP may act as a molecular chaperone on the luminal side of the ER membrane and facilitate the translocation of apoB (35Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L-S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10277-10281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MTP blocks apoB secretion and increases apoB intracellular degradation (26Haghpassand M. Wilder D. Moberly J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1468-1480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Wetteau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.E. Eisenberg C. Munk A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Rader D.J. Greeg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). We determined, therefore, if inhibition of MTP would affect apoB ubiquitination. HepG2 cells were pretreated with a specific MTP inhibitor (CP-10447) (26Haghpassand M. Wilder D. Moberly J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1468-1480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 2 h with or without the addition of lactacystin, followed by 30 min of radiolabeling and 30 min of chase under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 4, cells that were treated with the MTP inhibitor alone had minimal, if any, apoB secretion into the medium (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). The cell apoB level was also lower than that of control cells (Fig. 4 B, lane 2 versus lane 1), suggesting increased intracellular degradation. Co-treatment with MTP inhibitor and lactacystin blocked apoB degradation and, therefore, increased the apoB level in the cell lysate (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). The defect in apoB secretion was not, however, reversed by lactacystin (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), since lipid ligands could not be transferred to apoB molecules. Fig. 4 C represents the results from sequential immunoprecipitation; after apoB immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of radiolabeled apoB were aliquoted for a second step immunoprecipitation with anti-ubiquitin antibody. Note that MTP inhibitor treatment alone or together with lactacystin was associated with increased levels of ubiquitinated apoB conjugates (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2 and 4 versus lane 1). These data suggest strongly that MTP inhibition leads to increased cytosolic exposure and ubiquitination of nascent apoB. The results of the preceding experiments implied that when apoB translocation was impeded, there was increased exposure of apoB domains to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. These results did not tell us, however, how early in the translation-translocation process exposure to the cytosol occurred. Domains of apoB could have been exposed to the cytosol either during or after translation. Furthermore, if cytosolic exposure occurred after translation, Hsp70 and ubiquitinating enzymes could have been targeted to apoB domains that had not entered the ER lumen (i.e. apoB that was translated, but translocation-arrested) or to apoB domains that had completed translocation but were now being transported back across the ER membrane in a retrograde fashion. Two possible pathways linking nascent apoB to the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome pathways are depicted in Fig. 5. A model of translocation arrest and subsequent looping out of elongating polypeptides to the cytosol (36Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) predicts that apoB ubiquitination could take place before the polypeptide reached full-length (co-translational ubiquitination; Fig. 5 A), whereas a retrograde translocation model implies that only full-length apoB would be ubiquitinated (post-translational ubiquitination; Fig. 5 B). Of note, Benoist and Grand-Perret (37Benoist F. Grand-Perret T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20435-20442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) recently reported that apoB degradation by the proteasome could occur in a co-translational manner. To ascertain if nascent apoB is exposed to the cytosol co-translationally, we used puromycin pretreatment to synchronize protein translation before radiolabeling cellular proteins. Puromycin treatment is known to result in premature release of the newly synthesized polypeptides from the ribosome by interfering with tRNA binding to the ribosome (37Benoist F. Grand-Perret T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20435-20442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). After removal of puromycin, therefore, all of the ribosomes exist in an unengaged state and would be ready to initiate protein synthesis synchronously. As demonstrated in Fig. 6 A, following puromycin synchronization, the length of newly synthesized, radiolabeled apoB polypeptide chains increased in proportion to the duration of labeling period. Thus, after 3 min of labeling, nascent apoB chains reached lengths up to about 20% of full-length apoB (80–100 kDa) (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). Labeling for 8 min allowed synthesis of about 50% of full-length apoB (∼250 kDa) (Fig. 6 A, lane 3), while 15 min of labeling allowed apoB synthesis to reach about 70–80% of full length (∼400 kDa). These apoB peptides were, therefore, still undergoing translation. Sequential immunoprecipitation was performed to detect if these premature apoB polypeptides had been ubiquitinated (Fig. 6 B). Compared with lane 1, which served as a positive control for ubiquitination of full-length apoB from cells not pretreated with puromycin, the results in lanes 3 and 4 demonstrated that apoB polypeptide chains that reached 50–80% of full length were clearly ubiquitinated. In contrast, shorter stretches of the apoB NH2-terminal region showed minimal ubiquitination (lane 2). It is possible that the sites for ubiquitination of apoB are located in the carboxyl-terminal 50% of the molecule. There are no studies of the sites of apoB ubiquitination, but apoB has lysine residues distributed from the amino to the carboxyl terminus. We believe that it is unlikely that a lack of preferred lysine sites was the basis for the absence of ubiquitination of apoB peptides that were only about 20% of the full-length protein. By contrast, we believe that the absence of cytosolic exposure of these very short apoB peptides prevented ubiquitination. This conclusion is supported by the results shown in Fig. 3, demonstrating that apoB16 was secreted and only minimally ubiquitinated while apoB50 was not secreted but was heavily ubiquitinated in CHO cells, and by our prior demonstration of the lack of association of apoB16 with Hsp70 (27Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L-S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25220-25224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In additional experiments, co-translational ubiquitination of apoB was also confirmed by isolation of polysome-associated, partially synthesized apoB polypeptides; we observed that polysome-associated apoB polypeptides were conjugated with ubiquitin (data not shown). Overall, these experiments demonstrate clearly that apoB ubiquitination can occur co-translationally. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that perturbations impeding the translocation of apoB would increase co-translational ubiquitination of nascent apoB polypeptides. HepG2 cells were pretreated with either HA or the MTP inhibitor. After puromycin synchronization and 10 min of radiolabeling, apoB peptide chains were synthesized up to about 50% of full length (Fig. 7 A, lanes 2–4). The magnitude of co-translational apoB ubiquitination, as shown in Fig. 7 B, was increased by both HA and MTP inhibitor treatment (lanes 3 and 4) in comparison with that of control cells (lane 2). Thus, co-translational ubiquitination of apoB was increased when apoB translocation was inhibited. Furthermore, high molecular weight apoB-ubiquitin conjugates (>500 kDa) were easily detected (lanes 3 and 4) in cells treated with either HA or the MTP inhibitor. Our demonstration that apoB ubiquitination can occur even before the nascent apoB polypeptide chain reaches full length makes it very unlikely that retrograde translocation of apoB from the ER lumen back to the cytosol is necessary to explain its proteasomal degradation. Our observations are, by contrast, compatible with a model in which the initial co-translational targeting and translocation of the amino-terminal domain of apoB across the ER membrane is followed by translocation slowing or even translocation arrest, resulting in exposure of carboxyl-terminal domains to the cytosol. This model emphasizes that translocation of apoB across the ER membrane is an early sorting process that can determine the ultimate fate of newly synthesized apoB molecules; efficient translocation allows apoB to enter the secretory pathway, where it is assembled into a lipoprotein, whereas inefficient translocation exposes apoB to cytosolic degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The efficiency of translocation appears to be determined mainly by the availability of the other components of apoB-containing lipoproteins, particularly the core lipids, triglyceride, and cholesteryl ester. When lipid availability is limited, apoB co-translationally assumes a transmembrane topology and interacts with cytosolic Hsp70. This interaction facilitates degradation by both impeding further translocation (18Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 27Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L-S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The finding that both ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and proteasomes can be associated with the cytosolic face of the ER membrane is compatible with coupling of degradation to the translocation process (38Sommer T. Jentsch S.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 39Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 40Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the NH2-terminal 70 kDa of apoB polypeptide, which would be expected to co-translationally enter the ER lumen before translocational arrest occurs (31Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S. Humiston P. Davis R.A J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been detected in both the medium of cultured cells and the circulation of patients with abetelipoproteinemia, a disorder in which MTP is absent (31Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S. Humiston P. Davis R.A J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Du E.Z. Wang S.L. Karyden H.J. Sokol R. Curtiss L.K. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1309-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that proteasomal degradation might act as a molecular “razor,” shaving off cytosolically exposed domains of apoB while sparing the already translocated amino-terminal domain (8Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Trends. Biol. Sci. 1997; 7: 151Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In summary, apoB100 is a very large, extremely hydrophobic secretory protein that is constitutively synthesized and functions as a lipid transporter in hepatocytes. Our results indicate that these cells have evolved a very efficient quality control strategy to monitor the biogenesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins such that elimination of “lipid-challenged” nascent apoB can occur well before apoB synthesis is completed. Since degradation of a large secretory protein such as apoB requires significant investment in energy and time, it is reasonable that liver cells would favor a process of co-translational targeting to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway over a process involving retrograde translocation of full-length apoB. Whether this pathway is unique for apoB or is a model for other nascent secretory proteins that are degraded by the proteasome remains to be determined. We thank Pfizer Inc. (Groton, CT) for providing CP-10447, the inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein."
https://openalex.org/W2105834219,"A previously undescribed human member of the cystatin superfamily called cystatin F has been identified by expressed sequence tag sequencing in human cDNA libraries. A full-length cDNA clone was obtained from a library made from mRNA of CD34-depleted cord blood cells. The sequence of the cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding a putative 19-residue signal peptide and a mature protein of 126 amino acids with two disulfide bridges and enzyme-binding motifs homologous to those of Family 2 cystatins. Unlike other human cystatins, cystatin F has 2 additional Cys residues, indicating the presence of an extra disulfide bridge stabilizing the N-terminal region of the molecule. Recombinant cystatin F was produced in a baculovirus expression system and characterized. The mature recombinant protein processed by insect cells had an N-terminal segment 7 residues longer than that of cystatin C and displayed reversible inhibition of papain and cathepsin L (K i = 1.1 and 0.31 nm, respectively), but not cathepsin B. Like cystatin E/M, cystatin F is a glycoprotein, carrying two N-linked carbohydrate chains at positions 36 and 88. An immunoassay for quantification of cystatin F showed that blood contains low levels of the inhibitor (0.9 ng/ml). Six B cell lines in culture secreted barely detectable amounts of cystatin F, but several T cell lines and especially one myeloid cell line secreted significant amounts of the inhibitor. Northern blot analysis revealed that the cystatin F gene is primarily expressed in peripheral blood cells and spleen. Tissue expression clearly different from that of the ubiquitous inhibitor, cystatin C, was also indicated by a high incidence of cystatin F clones in cDNA libraries from dendritic and T cells, but no clones identified by expressed sequence tag sequencing in several B cell libraries and in >600 libraries from other human tissues and cells.

The mature recombinant protein processed by insect cells had an N-terminal segment 7 residues longer than that of cystatin C and displayed reversible inhibition of papain and cathepsin L (K i = 1.1 and 0.31 nm, respectively), but not cathepsin B. Like cystatin E/M, cystatin F is a glycoprotein, carrying two N-linked carbohydrate chains at positions 36 and 88. An immunoassay for quantification of cystatin F showed that blood contains low levels of the inhibitor (0.9 ng/ml). Six B cell lines in culture secreted barely detectable amounts of cystatin F, but several T cell lines and especially one myeloid cell line secreted significant amounts of the inhibitor. Northern blot analysis revealed that the cystatin F gene is primarily expressed in peripheral blood cells and spleen. Tissue expression clearly different from that of the ubiquitous inhibitor, cystatin C, was also indicated by a high incidence of cystatin F clones in cDNA libraries from dendritic and T cells, but no clones identified by expressed sequence tag sequencing in several B cell libraries and in >600 libraries from other human tissues and cells. expressed sequence tag polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cysteine proteinase inhibitors of the cystatin superfamily are ubiquitous in the body and are generally tight-binding inhibitors of papain-like cysteine proteinases, such as cathepsins B, H, L, S, and K (for review, see Ref. 1Abrahamson M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). They should therefore serve a protective function to regulate the activities of such endogenous proteinases, which otherwise may cause uncontrolled proteolysis and tissue damage. Cysteine proteinase activity can not normally be measured in body fluids, but can be detected extracellularly in conditions like endotoxin-induced sepsis (2Assfalg-Machleidt, I., Jochum, M., Klaubert, W., Inthorn, D., and Machleidt, W. (1988) Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 369,(suppl.) 263–269Google Scholar) and metastasizing cancer (3Köppel P. Baici A. Keist R. Matzku S. Keller R. Exp. Cell Biol. 1994; 52: 293-299Google Scholar) and at local inflammatory processes such as in rheumatoid arthritis (4Gabrijelcic D. Annan-Prah A. Rodic B. Rozman B. Cotic V. Turk V. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1990; 28: 149-153PubMed Google Scholar), purulent bronchiectasis (5Buttle D.J. Burnett D. Abrahamson M. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1990; 50: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and periodontitis (6Cox S.W. Eley B.M. J. Periodontal Res. 1989; 24: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which indicates that a tight enzyme regulation by cystatins is a necessity in the normal state. A deficiency state in which the levels of the intracellular cystatin, cystatin B, are lowered due to mutations has recently been shown to segregate with a form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (7Pennacchio L.A. Lehesjoki A.E. Stone N.E. Willour V.L. Virtaneva K. Miao J. D'Amato E. Ramirez L. Faham M. Koskiniemi M. Warrington J.A. Norio R. de la Chapelle A. Cox D.R. Myers R.M. Science. 1996; 271: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), which points to additional specialized functions of cystatins. Moreover, cell culture results showing that chicken cystatin, human cystatin C, and human cystatin D inhibit the replication of polio (8Korant B.D. Brzin J. Turk V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 1072-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), herpes simplex (9Björck L. Grubb A. Kjellén L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 941-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and corona (10Collins, A. R., and Grubb, A. (1998) Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 12, in pressGoogle Scholar) viruses, respectively, and that human cystatin A inhibits rhabdovirus-induced apoptosis (11Björklund H.V. Johansson T.R. Rinne A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5658-5662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that cystatins play additional roles in the human defense system. The cystatins constitute a superfamily of evolutionary related proteins, all composed of at least one 100–120-residue domain with conserved sequence motifs (12Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The previously well characterized single-domain human members of this superfamily could be grouped in two protein families. The Family 1 members, cystatins (or stefins) A and B, contain ∼100 amino acid residues, lack disulfide bridges, and are not synthesized as preproteins with signal peptides. The Family 2 cystatins, cystatins C, D, S, SN, and SA, are secreted proteins of ∼120 amino acid residues (M r 13,000–14,000) and have two characteristic intrachain disulfide bonds. Recently, we identified an additional human cystatin superfamily member by EST1 sequencing in epithelial cell-derived cDNA libraries that we named cystatin E (13Ni J. Abrahamson M. Zhang M. Fernandez M.A. Grubb A. Su J., Yu, G.-L. Li Y. Parmelee D. Xing L. Coleman T.A. Gentz S. Thotakura R. Nguyen N. Hesselberg M. Gentz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10853-10858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The same cystatin was independently discovered by differential display experiments as an mRNA species down-regulated in breast tumor tissue, but present in the surrounding epithelium and reported under the name cystatin M (14Sotiropoulou G. Anisowicz A. Sager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 903-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cystatin E/M is an atypical secreted lowM r cystatin in that it is a glycoprotein and shows only 30–35% sequence identity in alignments with the human Family 2 cystatins, which demonstrates that additional cystatin families are yet to be identified (13Ni J. Abrahamson M. Zhang M. Fernandez M.A. Grubb A. Su J., Yu, G.-L. Li Y. Parmelee D. Xing L. Coleman T.A. Gentz S. Thotakura R. Nguyen N. Hesselberg M. Gentz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10853-10858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The cystatin E/M gene has been localized to chromosome 11 (15Stenman G. Astrom A.K. Roijer E. Sotiropoulou G. Zhang M. Sager R. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1997; 76: 45-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas all human Family 2 cystatin genes are clustered on the short arm of chromosome 20 (16Schnittger S. Gopal Rao V.V.N. Abrahamson M. Hansmann I. Genomics. 1993; 16: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which further stresses that cystatin E/M is only distantly related to the other secreted human low M r cystatins. In this investigation, we continued our search for novel human proteins with distant relationship to the cystatin superfamily. We report the characteristics of a cystatin identified in cDNA libraries from immune cells, cystatin F, which is only 30–34% homologous in overall sequence to the human Family 2 cystatins, but also only 29% homologous to cystatin E/M. Like cystatin E/M, cystatin F is a glycoprotein and a potent cysteine proteinase inhibitor. A data base containing >1,000,000 ESTs obtained from >650 different cDNA libraries has been generated by Human Genome Sciences, Inc. and the Institute for Genomic Research using high throughput automated DNA sequence analysis of randomly selected human cDNA clones (17Adams, M. D., Kerlavage, A. R., Fleischmann, R. D., Fuldner, R. A., Bult, C. J., and Lee, N. H. (1995)Nature 377 (suppl.) 3–20Google Scholar, 18Feng G.-S. Ouyang Y.-B. Hu D.-P. Shi Z.-Q. Gentz R. Ni J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12129-12132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Sequence homology comparisons of each EST were performed against the GenBankTM Data Bank using the BLAST and BLASTN algorithms (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). ESTs having homology to previously identified sequences (p ≤ 0.01) were collected in a data base. A specific homology and motif search using the known amino acid sequence of human cystatin C (M27891) against this data base revealed several ESTs having translated sequences >30% homologous to that of cystatin C. One clone (HCUDE60) encoding an intact N-terminal signal peptide was identified in a human CD34-depleted cord blood cell library and selected for further investigation. The complete cDNA sequence of both strands of this clone was determined, and its homology to the cystatin C cDNA was confirmed. The entire coding sequence of the cystatin F cDNA was amplified using standard polymerase chain reaction techniques with primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-sequences of the gene (upstream primer (with tailing BamHI site underlined), 5′-CGC GGA TCC GCC ATG CGA GCG GCTGGA-3′; and downstream primer (with Asp718 site), 5′-CGC GGT ACC CTG AAG AGG CGG GGG TCA-3′). The amplified fragment was purified, digested with BamHI and Asp718, and again purified. The baculovirus expression vector pA2, derived from pNR704 (20Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Virology. 1989; 170: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 21Gentz R. Hayes A. Grau N. Fountoulakis M. Lahm L. Ozmen L. Garotta G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was digested withBamHI and Asp718, followed by agarose gel purification. The opened and purified pA2 vector was ligated with the amplified cystatin coding sequence using T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant baculoviruses encoding cystatin F were generated by co-transfection of Sf9 cells with 5 μg of transfer vector containing the HCUDE60 cDNA and 1 μg of BaculoGold viral DNA (Pharmingen) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Details on screening and cloning of the recombinant baculoviruses have been reported earlier (13Ni J. Abrahamson M. Zhang M. Fernandez M.A. Grubb A. Su J., Yu, G.-L. Li Y. Parmelee D. Xing L. Coleman T.A. Gentz S. Thotakura R. Nguyen N. Hesselberg M. Gentz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10853-10858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recombinant cystatin F was purified from 10 liters of Sf9 cell supernatants at 92 h post-infection. The insect cells were grown in EXCEL401 medium (JRH Biosciences) with 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The harvested supernatants were pooled and clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g in a continuous flow centrifuge. The supernatant was loaded onto a strong cation-exchange column (Poros HS50, PerSeptive Biosystems) at pH 6.2. The column had previously been equilibrated in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 100 mm NaCl. After loading the supernatant onto the HS50 column, the column was washed with the equilibration buffer, followed by successive elutions with the same buffer containing 250, 400, 600, and 1000 mm NaCl. The recombinant cystatin F eluted in the 400 mm NaCl fraction. This fraction was then loaded onto a size-exclusion chromatography column (Superdex S-75, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which had previously been equilibrated in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 100 mm NaCl. The fractions containing cystatin F were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis and pooled for the next step. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. This pool was then loaded onto a pre-equilibrated strong anion-exchange chromatography column (Poros HQ50, PerSeptive Biosystems), and the flow-through fraction was collected. The flow-though pool from the HQ50 column was finally re-equilibrated in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 100 mm NaCl and then loaded onto a weak cation-exchange column (Poros CM20, PerSeptive Biosystems). The recombinant cystatin F was eluted using a linear salt gradient (from 100 to 1000 mm NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0). The eluted fractions containing purified cystatin F (∼at 400 mm NaCl) were identified by SDS-PAGE and verified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The final protein concentration (3.6 mg/ml) was estimated using the Bradford assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Endotoxin levels were assayed using the Amebocyte lysate test (BioWhittaker, Inc.) and were <0.05 enzyme units/mg of protein. The overall yield of recombinant cystatin F from the 10 liters of insect cell culture supernatants was ∼42 mg. An antiserum against cystatin F was raised by injecting 0.2 mg of isolated recombinant antigen (see above) in Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco) subcutaneously into a rabbit. The injection was repeated after 3 weeks, and the rabbit was bled every third week. The specificity of the antiserum was tested by immunoelectrophoresis of the recombinant cystatin F used as antigen; of concentrated proteinuria urine containing cystatins A, B, C, S, SN, and E and kininogen (23Abrahamson M. Barrett A.J. Salvesen G. Grubb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11282-11289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and of recombinant cystatins C, D, and E (13Ni J. Abrahamson M. Zhang M. Fernandez M.A. Grubb A. Su J., Yu, G.-L. Li Y. Parmelee D. Xing L. Coleman T.A. Gentz S. Thotakura R. Nguyen N. Hesselberg M. Gentz R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15737-15744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IgG fraction of 50 ml of antiserum was isolated by absorption to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subsequent elution with 0.1 m glycine buffer, pH 2.2. The eluate was immediately neutralized by addition of 2 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The IgG fraction of the antiserum was used for construction of a double-sandwich ELISA, using detailed methods and materials described earlier for a mouse cystatin C ELISA (26Håkansson K. Huh C. Grubb A. Karlsson S. Abrahamson M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1996; 114: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, wells in polystyrene microtiter plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Copenhagen, Denmark) were coated with the IgG fraction of the antiserum against cystatin F as catching antibody. Sample or, as calibrator, isolated recombinant cystatin F (in dilutions from 0.2 to 100 ng/ml) was added to the wells. A portion of the same IgG fraction of the antiserum that had been biotinylated (27Guesdon J.L. Ternynck T. Avrameas S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1979; 27: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar) was used as detecting antibody. Bound cystatin F was quantified using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the color reaction with 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma) to detect peroxidase activity. The absorbance was read at 405 nm in a Titerek Multiscan spectrophotometer. For quantitation of human cystatin C, a similar double-sandwich ELISA, but with a monoclonal antibody as detecting reagent, was used (28Olafsson I. Löfberg H. Abrahamson M. Grubb A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1988; 48: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As an assay control for both the cystatin F and cystatin C ELISAs, pooled normal human serum (DAKO A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) was included in the sample series at each measurement. As starting material for cystatin F purification attempts, blood was drawn from healthy volunteers in tubes containing EDTA to prevent coagulation. The blood plasma was separated from cells, and an inhibitor preservation mixture resulting in final concentrations of 5 mm benzamidinium chloride, 10 mm EDTA, and 15 mm sodium azide was immediately added to prevent breakdown of sample proteins. For analysis of cells in culture, the human cell lines Jurkat (29Gillis S. Watson J. J. Exp.

Biomedicine (Paris). 1975; 22: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar), Nalm6 (33Buchholz B. Frei E. Eisenbarth J. Weigand M. Ludwig R. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 2101-2107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and THP-1 (ATCC TIB-202) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine, 1% (v/v) 100× nonessential amino acids, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The initial seeding of cells was routinely 0.5 × 106 cells/ml, and samples of conditioned media were collected after 24–72 h of culturing, whereupon the separated cells were counted. For purification attempts, Jurkat, MOLT-4, and U-937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with supplements as described above, but without serum. Following 72 h of incubation under these conditions, counting of cells in the presence of trypan blue showed ∼20% dead cells. A total of 1 liter of media from such cultures were pooled, recentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to completely remove cell debris, and stored at −80 °C after addition of the inhibitor preservation mixture described above. For fractionation of blood plasma, solid ammonium sulfate was added to a series of tubes containing 2-ml portions of plasma to achieve 25, 30, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, and 75% (w/v) saturation. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, the tubes were centrifuged (10,000 ×g, 30 min), the supernatants were collected, and the precipitates were dissolved in water. To concentrate such samples and samples of spent culture medium, ultrafiltration using Centricon-3 concentrators (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) was carried out. Immunoblotting of samples was done after electrophoretic separation on 16.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using the buffer system of Schägger and von Jagow (34Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) or after agarose gel electrophoresis at pH 8.6 (35Jeppsson J.-O. Laurell C.-B. Franzén B. Clin. Chem. 1979; 25: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), followed by electric transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). The membranes were incubated with the IgG fraction of the polyclonal antiserum against recombinant cystatin F (1–10 μg/ml), and bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) and a coupled chemiluminescence reaction (ECL Plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ion-exchange chromatography was performed on a MonoQ 10/10 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Gel filtration was performed on a Superdex 75 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Glycosylation analysis of cystatin F was performed by determining the monosaccharide content in a purified preparation of the recombinant protein. Approximately 10 μg of the protein was hydrolyzed with 0.2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h. The hydrolysate was dried in a SpeedVac and reconstituted in 50 μl of deionized water, after which monosaccharides were analyzed on a Dionex carbohydrate analyzer (36Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A Dionex PA-1 column was used to separate the monosaccharides by isocratic elution with 12 mm NaOH. The monosaccharides were detected by integrated amperometry. Glycosylation analysis was also done by incubation with peptide N-glycosidase F (EC3.2.2.18) under conditions recommended by the enzyme supplier (Oxford GlycoSystems, Abingdon, United Kingdom), followed by 16.5% SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Automated N-terminal sequencing using an ABI492 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) was carried out after electrophoresis on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex) using the buffer system by Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), blotting onto a ProBlott membrane (Applied Biosystems, Inc.), staining with Ponceau S (0.2% in 4% acetic acid), and excision of the band of interest. Amino acid composition analysis was carried out using a Beckman High Performance Analyser System 6300 after in vacuo hydrolysis of samples for 24, 48, and 72 h in 6 m HCl. Size determination by gel chromatography was performed on the Superdex 75 column run as described above, with the elution volumes for aprotinin (M r = 6500), cytochrome c(M r = 12,400), chymotrypsinogen (M r = 23,400), and β-lactoglobulin (M r = 35,000) used for construction of a calibration curve. To analyze the content of free thiol groups in recombinant cystatin F, the Ellman reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Sigma) was performed under conditions described earlier (38Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). One sample of isolated recombinant cystatin F was analyzed directly after purification (see above). A second sample of cystatin F and a sample of papain, used as a positive reaction control, were both analyzed after mild reduction to reduce oxidized sulfhydryl groups. Papain (17.5 mg; Sigma type III) and cystatin F (0.36 mg) was incubated in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min. Removal of excess dithiothreitol was accomplished by chromatography on a HighTrap desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Portions of the desalted samples were directly analyzed for free thiol groups by the Ellman reaction. The total concentrations of papain and cystatin F in the desalted samples were determined by A 280measurement and the Bradford assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), respectively. The proportion of active enzyme in the papain sample was measured by E-64 titration (see below). The methods used for active-site titration of papain (using benzoyl-dl-Arg p-nitroanilide (Bachem Feinchemikalien, Bubendorf, Switzerland) as substrate), titration of the molar enzyme inhibitory concentration in cystatin F preparations, and determination of equilibrium constants for dissociation (K i) of complexes between cystatin F and cysteine proteinases have been reviewed (1Abrahamson M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The enzymes used were papain (EC 3.4.22.2; from Sigma), activatable to 70–75% after affinity purification on Sepharose-coupled Gly-Gly-Tyr-Arg as detailed previously (39Blumberg S. Schechter I. Berger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 40Hall A. Håkansson K. Mason R.W. Grubb A. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5115-5121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), human cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1; from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), and human cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15; Calbiochem). The fluorogenic substrate used forKi determinations was benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (10 μm; Bachem Feinchemikalien), and the assay buffer was 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (adjusted to pH 6.5 for papain and to pH 6.0 for cathepsin B and cathepsin L) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 2 mm EDTA. Steady-state velocities were measured before and after addition of cystatin F in assays at 37 °C, and K i values were calculated according to Henderson (41Henderson P.J.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Corrections for substrate competition were made using K m values determined for the substrate batch used under the assay conditions employed (60, 55, and 3.2 μm for papain, cathepsin B, and cathepsin L, respectively). On analysis of EST sequences obtained from human cDNA libraries, several clones encoding polypeptides with low but significant homology (30–35%) to the cystatin C sequence (42Abrahamson M. Grubb A. Olafsson I. Lundwall Å. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) were identified. Some of these encoded cystatin E/M (13Ni J. Abrahamson M. Zhang M. Fernandez M.A. Grubb A. Su J., Yu, G.-L. Li Y. Parmelee D. Xing L. Coleman T.A. Gentz S. Thotakura R. Nguyen N. Hesselberg M. Gentz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10853-10858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but a group of others encoded another cystatin-related protein. A full-length cDNA clone in the latter group (designated HCUDE60) was identified in a library from CD34-depleted cord blood cells. The 727-base pair cDNA included an open reading frame encoding a 145-residue preprotein (Fig. 1), of which the first 19 theoretically (43von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar) should constitute the signal peptide. The cDNA contained a typical consensus sequence for initiation of translation (44Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5233-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) around the start ATG codon of the open reading frame and a normal polyadenylation signal (ATTAAA) at a distance of 18 nucleotides from a poly(A) stretch in the 3′-end. An alignment of the deduced 126-residue mature protein sequence with the six known secreted single-domain human cystatins demonstrated that the novel protein was most similar to cystatin C of the Family 2 cystatins (34% identical residues) and a bit more distantly related to cystatins D, S, SN, and SA (30–32% identity) (Fig. 2). The resemblance to the recently reported atypical secreted cystatin, cystatin E/M, was similarly low, with only 29% of alignable residues identical. Thus, the novel protein should most likely be seen as a first representative of a third protein family within the category of secreted single-domain human cystatins (12Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. J.

The homologies to the human Family 1 cystatins, cystatins A and B, were even lower (22 and 20% identities, respectively), as was the homology to the inhibitor-active domain 2 of human kininogen (24% identity). As also seen for cystatin E/M, the novel cystatin showed a closer relationship with domain 3 of kininogen, almost as high as with the Family 2 cystatins (32% identical residues). The sequence contained a central Gln-Xaa-Val-Xaa-Gly motif, a typical Gly residue in the N-terminal segment 44 positions earlier, and also a Pro-Trp pair toward the C-terminal end of the translation product, like the sequences of the human Family 2 or 3 cystatins and cystatin E/M. The sequence also contained 4 Cys residues toward the C-terminal end, corresponding to those forming disulfide bridges in cystatin C and chicken cystatin,"

These ring-shaped clamps tether DNA polymerase III holoenzyme to the template, facilitating rapid and processive DNA synthesis. This report focuses on the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis catalyzed by the γ complex during clamp loading. We show that the energy from ATP binding to γ complex powers several initial events in the clamp loading pathway. The γ complex (γ2δδ′χψ) binds two ATP molecules (one per γ subunit in the complex) with high affinity (K d = 1–2.5 × 10−6m) or two adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)(ATPγS) molecules with slightly lower affinity (K d = 5–6.5 × 10−6m). Experiments performed prior to the first ATP turnover (k cat = 4 × 10−3 s−1 at 4 °C), or in the presence of ATPγS (k cat = 1 × 10−4s−1 at 37 °C), demonstrate that upon interaction with ATP the γ complex undergoes a change in conformation. This ATP-bound γ complex binds β and opens the ring at the dimer interface. Still prior to ATP hydrolysis, the composite of γ complex and the open β ring binds with high affinity to primer-template DNA. Thus ATP binding powers all the steps in the clamp loading pathway leading up to the assembly of a γ complex·open β ring·DNA intermediate, setting the stage for ring closing and turnover of the clamp loader, steps that may be linked to subsequent hydrolysis of ATP.

Rapid and efficient duplication of genomic DNA depends on biomolecular machines known as DNA replicases. In diverse organisms these multicomponent biological machines exhibit varying degrees of complexity, including substantial differences in subunit composition. It is apparent, however, that certain mechanisms of action and the associated protein tools are conserved through evolution. One prominent example is the mechanism for processive DNA replication common among replicases from bacteriophage T4, Escherichia coli, yeast, and humans. Briefly, a clamp loader uses energy from ATP to assemble a circular protein clamp around DNA; the clamp, now topologically linked to DNA, tethers DNA polymerase to the template, and by sliding freely on duplex DNA it allows continuous replication of several thousand nucleotides without a dissociation event (reviewed in Refs. 1Kelman Z.

The E. coli clamp loader, γ complex, is a composite of five different proteins, γ, δ, δ′, χ, and ψ, of which γ is the ATP-binding subunit essential for clamp loading (4Lee S.H Walker J.R. Proc. Natl.

The clamp, β, is a dimeric ring with a 35-Å inner diameter, large enough to encircle DNA (8Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J.

The core polymerase is a nonprocessive, inefficient DNA polymerase that extends a primer by only 10–20 nucleotides before dissociating from the template (17Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the β clamp tethers the core polymerase to template DNA, however, the enzyme develops high processivity and extends DNA by several thousand nucleotides per binding event (18Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6561-6569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

In the current model for E. coli DNA replication, after the assembly of an initiation complex in which the polymerase III holoenzyme is tethered to a primed DNA template by circular protein clamps, the two core polymerases in the holoenzyme synthesize leading and lagging strand DNA synchronously (20Sinha N.K.

Synthesis of the leading strand occurs in the direction of replication fork movement, but the lagging strand is synthesized in the opposite direction in discrete 1–2-kilobase pair-long Okazaki fragments. Therefore on the leading strand, after one clamp loading event and initiation complex formation, the polymerase can extend an RNA primer for several thousand nucleotides. On the lagging strand, however, the polymerase must initiate synthesis at new primers every few seconds, and a protein clamp must be loaded at each primer for initiation complex formation (24Stukenberg P.T. Turner J.T. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, clamp loader action is required continuously through the entire process of genome replication. The clamp loader belongs to the category of proteins known as molecular matchmakers. These proteins, by definition, use their ATPase activity to promote assembly of a stable complex between target macromolecules (25Sancar A. Hearst J.E. Science. 1993; 259: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), as the clamp loader uses ATP to assemble a complex between a clamp and DNA. Recent studies of the E. coli clamp loader have revealed substantial information about its subunit composition and its mechanism of action. The γ complex contains one each of δ, δ′, χ, and ψ subunits, and two or three γ subunits (6Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6555-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

O'Donnell, unpublished results.1J. T. Turner, Z. Kelman, M. M. Hingorani, and M. O'Donnell, unpublished results.; χ interacts with SSB,2facilitating DNA chain extension at physiological ionic strength, and the function of ψ is unknown (29O'Donnell M. Studwell P.S. J. Biol.

Initial insight into how the clamp loader works was provided by studies showing that the free δ subunit binds β in the absence of ATP, but when δ is in the γ complex ATP is required for its interaction with β. It has been postulated that in the presence of ATP a conformational change in γ complex presents δ for interaction with β (27Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Once this interaction is established, the clamp loader must assemble the β ring around DNA, and it must release the β·DNA complex to complete its job as a molecular matchmaker. At present there is not a clear understanding of how these steps occur and how the ATPase activity of γ complex powers β assembly on DNA. An earlier study with an ATPase mutant γ complex demonstrated that inhibition of ATP hydrolysis blocks DNA replication, and this effect was attributed to the inability of the mutant complex to assemble a β clamp on DNA (7Xiao H. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13378-13383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study we have continued to investigate how the clamp loader uses ATP, and we were surprised to find that ATP binding powers the clamp loading process almost to completion. Initially, quantitative nucleotide binding assays were used to characterize γ complex interaction with ATP and its slowly hydrolyzing analog, ATPγS. Partial proteolysis assays, DNA binding experiments, and a novel ring-opening assay were performed prior to and subsequent to ATP/ATPγS hydrolysis to separate the role of ATP binding from hydrolysis in clamp loading. We show here that ATP binding induces a conformational change in the γ complex, promotes its interaction with β, and powers β ring opening. The ATP-bound γ complex·β complex binds primer-template DNA leading to formation of a stable γ complex·open β ring·DNA composite that is an important intermediate in the clamp loading pathway (Fig. 10). Proteins were overexpressed and purified as described: γ (31Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), β and L273C-β (32Onrust, R.

Primer-template DNA was prepared by annealing primer 28 to 100-nt ssDNA1 in a ratio of 1 template to 1 primer, and dsDNA was prepared similarly by annealing 100-nt ssDNA1 to 100-nt ssDNA2. M13mp18 ssDNA was purified and primed with a 30-nt DNA as described (31Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Turner J.

The serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc SC was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell, and polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates were purchased from EM Separations. Reaction buffer A contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 8 mmMgCl2, and 10% glycerol. Reaction buffer B was the same as buffer A but without BSA. Column buffer A was the same as buffer A except it contained 4% glycerol instead of 10%. Column buffer B was the same as buffer A but without BSA and with 100 mm NaCl; and the SDS loading buffer contained 400 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm DTT, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue. β was 3H-labeled by reductive methylation as described (36Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), to a specific activity of 5 × 104 cpm/pmol (dimer), and found to be as active as β in DNA replication. [3H]β (500 fmol of dimer) was incubated in Reaction buffer A with singly primed M13mp18 ssDNA (400 fmol) coated with SSB (140 pmol as tetramer), and γ complex (γ or K51R-γ; 500 fmol) in a 75-μl reaction volume. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C when 1 mm ATP was added to the reaction, or for up to 1 h at 37 °C when ATPγS was added, followed by gel filtration over a 5-ml Bio-Gel A-15m column (Bio-Rad) in Column buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. Fractions of 200 μl were collected, and 150-μl aliquots were subjected to liquid scintillation counting to detect and quantitate [3H]β. A (dT)35-primed poly(dA) template was used to measure DNA replication in the presence of various nucleotides. A poly(dA) template (120 μm total nucleotide; average length, 4000 nts) was primed with a (dT)35 DNA (20:1 ratio) and incubated with γ complex (0.025 μm) and β (0.025 μm dimer), in the absence of nucleotides or in the presence of 1 mm ATP or ATPγS, for 5 min at 23 °C in Reaction buffer A (30 μl final volume). Core polymerase (αεθ) was added (0.025 μm), and following incubation for another 1 min the reaction was shifted to 37 °C and replication initiated by addition of 500 μm [α-32P]dTTP. At various times the reaction was quenched by mixing 7 μl of the reaction mix with 7 μl of 1% SDS + 100 mm EDTA. Aliquots were spotted onto DE81 filters (Whatman), and free [α-32P]dTTP was rinsed away with 0.3 m ammonium formate + 0.01 mpyrophosphate. The molar amount of [α-32P]dTMP incorporated into DNA was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting and plotted versus reaction time. The steady-state ATPase activity of γ complex (γ and K51R-γ) was measured at 4 or 37 °C by monitoring hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP to [α-32P]ADP + Pi. γ complex (γ or K51R-γ, 1 μm) was mixed with ATP + [α-32P]ATP (1 mm) and β (1 μm dimer) in the presence of 1 μmprimer-template DNA in Reaction buffer B. Aliquots were removed after varying time intervals and quenched with an equal volume of 1n HCl, followed by chloroform denaturation of protein and neutralization with base (1 n NaOH + 0.25 mTris-base). The quenched solutions were analyzed by polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography in 0.6m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 3.4. [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ADP were quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the molar amount of ADP formed was plotted versus reaction time. ATPase rate constants were calculated from initial velocities of ADP formation and γ complex concentration. ATPγS hydrolysis catalyzed by γ complex was measured by monitoring conversion of [γ-35S]ATPγS to ADP + [35S]thiophosphate. The assays were performed at 37 °C with γ complex (5 μm), [γ-35S]ATPγS (500 μm), with or without β (5 μm) and primer-template DNA (5 μm), as described above for ATPase activity. ATPase activity of the γ subunit (5 μm) was also measured by similar assays performed at 37 °C in the absence of β and DNA. ATP and ATPγS binding to γ complex was measured at 23 °C using nitrocellulose membrane binding assays in which a constant amount of γ complex was titrated with increasing concentrations of ATP or ATPγS. Nitrocellulose membrane circles (25 mm) were washed with 0.5 n NaOH, rinsed immediately with water, and equilibrated in membrane wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl) prior to use. The reactions contained γ complex (2 or 5 μm), β (2 or 5 μm dimer), and [α-32P]ATP (0–40 μm) or [γ-35S]ATP (0–50 μm) in Reaction buffer B in a total volume of 15 μl. Samples (10-μl aliquots) were filtered through nitrocellulose membranes on a glass microanalysis filter assembly (Fisher) immediately after addition of ATP or after a 10-min incubation of reactions containing ATPγS. The membranes were washed before and after filtration with 1 ml of membrane wash buffer. 1-μl aliquots of the samples were spotted on a separate nitrocellulose membrane to determine total nucleotide in the reaction. The radioactivity on the membranes was quantitated on a PhosphorImager, and the molar amount of ATP or ATPγS bound to γ complex was determined and plotted versus nucleotide concentration. The binding isotherms were fit to Equation 1 describing the binding of two ligands to a single macromolecule,ML/MT=(K1LF+2K1K2LF2)/(1+K1LF+K1K2LF2)(Eq. 1) or to the Hill equation to estimate cooperativity in ligand binding (Equation 2).ML/MT=LFn/(K+LFn)(Eq. 2) where ML is the amount of ligand bound to protein;M T is the total protein concentration;K 1 and K 2 are association constants; LF is the free ligand concentration (ATP or ATPγS); n is the Hill coefficient; K is a dissociation constant; and ML/M T is the fraction of ligand bound per γ complex, or ligand bound per γ subunit in the γ complex (in the Hill equation). The binding curves were fit by a nonlinear least squares fitting program using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Tryptic digestion of γ was performed at 37 °C in the absence and in the presence of various nucleotides. The reaction contained γ subunit (10 μm) and no nucleotide, ATP, ADP, or ATPγS (2 mm) in Reaction buffer B in a total volume of 12 μl. Trypsin was added to a final concentration of 0.05 μg, and after 10 min at 37 °C the reaction was quenched with 10 μl of SDS loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The proteolytic products were analyzed on a 12% gel by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Tryptic digestion of γ complex was performed with 5 μmγ complex in Reaction buffer B in the absence or in the presence of ATP, ADP, ATPγS (500 μm) in a total reaction volume of 10 μl. Trypsin was added to a final concentration of 0.8 μg, and following incubation for 10 min at 37 °C the reaction was quenched with an equal volume of SDS loading buffer. The products were analyzed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel as described above. Some of the proteolytic fragments were N-terminally sequenced at the Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Technology Center. Interaction of γ complex with β was examined by gel filtration essentially as described in an earlier report (27Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, γ complex (5 μm) was incubated with β (2.5 μm dimer) in 200 μl of Column buffer B containing no nucleotide, 0.3 mm ATP, or 0.3 mm ATPγS. The protein mix was gel-filtered at 4 °C on a Superose 12 column equilibrated with the same buffer. After the first 7 ml, fractions of 200 μl were collected, and migration of the proteins was monitored by analyzing aliquots (40 μl) of the column fractions by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. βPK, a modified β with a C terminus kinase recognition site, was 32P-labeled by cAMP-dependent protein kinase as described earlier, and was found as active as β in DNA replication (36Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). [32P]βPK (0.1 μm dimer) was added to Reaction buffer B (40-μl final volume) containing 100 mm NaCl, with no nucleotide, ATP, ADP, or ATPγS (0.5 mm). The total protein was adjusted to 100 μg with BSA. γ complex (0.3 μm) was added to the reaction followed by immediate initiation of digestion with 0.2 μg of Pronase E (23 °C). After 2 min the reaction was quenched with 20 μl of stop solution (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.3 mm DTT, 14% SDS, 14% glycerol, 70 mm EDTA, and 2 mmPefabloc SC). 30-μl aliquots were analyzed on the discontinuous Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel system of Schagger and von Jagow as described (37Schagger H. von Jagow G.

A similar assay was performed to obtain a footprint of βPK prior to ATP hydrolysis. At 4 °C, [32P]βPK (0.1 μm dimer) was incubated for 1 min with γ complex (0.2 μm) and BSA (100 μg) in Reaction buffer B + 100 mm NaCl. ATP was added to initiate the reaction, and after 5 s Pronase E was added to a final concentration of 2 μg. After another 5 s, the γ complex ATPase and Pronase E activities were quenched by addition of 20 μl of HCl (1 n) and 20 μl of stop solution, followed by neutralization with base. The proteolysis products were analyzed as described above. Gel filtration assays were performed on Bio-Gel A-15m columns to detect interaction between γ complex, β, and M13mp18 ssDNA. [3H]γ complex (specific activity, 1.1 × 104 cpm/pmol) was prepared by tritium-labeling the δ′ subunit and incorporating it into the γ complex as described (39Stukenberg P.T. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13384-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). [3H]γ complex (0.3 μm) and M13mp18 DNA (0.02 μm) were mixed in 25 μl of Column buffer A in the absence or in the presence of β (0.3 μm dimer) and nucleotide (0.5 mm). Following incubation for 1 min at 23 °C, the reaction mixture was gel-filtered on a 5-ml column equilibrated in Column buffer A containing 0.1 mm ATP, ADP, or ATPγS (when in reaction). 200-μl fractions were collected and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Complementary assays with radiolabeled β were performed as described above except with [32P]βPK (36Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and unlabeled γ complex. Gel shift assays were performed under nondenaturing conditions to detect interaction between γ complex, β, and short radiolabeled DNAs. 100-nt ssDNA1 was 32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. After free nucleotide was removed by spinning through a Bio-Gel P-30 column (Bio-Rad), the DNA was annealed to primer 28 or 100-nt ssDNA2 to prepare primer-template DNA or 100-nt dsDNA, respectively. Radiolabeled DNA (1 μm) was mixed with increasing concentrations of γ complex and β (0–5 μm; 0–10 μm with dsDNA) in 10 μl of Reaction buffer B, in the presence of 0.5 mm ATPγS. Following incubation for 2 min at 23 °C, the samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing 20 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mmATPγS in TBE buffer. Stability of γ complex·β bound to primer-template DNA versus ssDNA was tested in similar assays in which 1 μm32P-labeled DNA was bound to 5 μm γ complex·β followed by incubation with 60 μm unlabeled 70-nt ssDNA (1 min at 4 °C) and analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried onto DE81 paper, and the 32P-labeled DNAs were visualized on a PhosphorImager. A modified version of β, with Leu-273 (at the dimer interface) changed to cysteine and Cys-333 (at the protein surface) changed to serine, was prepared and tested for activity as described.1 L273C-β activity in ATPase assays, DNA replication assays, and clamp loading assays was identical to that of wild-type β. β ring opening was detected by measuring the labeling of Cys-273 with eosin-5-maleimide. A mixture of L273C-β (2 μm) and γ complex (2 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, + 10 mm MgCl2(10 μl final volume) was incubated in the dark at 4 °C for 1 min. ATP or ATPγS (0.5 mm) was added, followed in 10 s by addition of 1 μl of eosin-5-maleimide stock solution (5 mm in Me2SO). Control reactions were performed with L273C-β alone and with γ complex + L273C-β in the absence of nucleotides. The reactions were quenched after 30 s with an equal volume of 0.5 m DTT + SDS loading buffer; the samples were boiled for 2 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. Fluorescence-labeled β was visualized on a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad). The ring-opening assay was performed similarly in the presence of 3 μm primer-template DNA. The proteins were incubated with primer-template DNA in the presence of ATPγS (1 min at 23 °C), and the labeling reaction and analysis were performed as described above. The E. coli clamp loader uses ATP to convert the inefficient polymerase III core enzyme into a highly processive DNA replicating machine. Earlier studies have demonstrated that γ complex loads the circular clamp β onto a primed DNA template, and β tethers the polymerase to DNA, facilitating highly processive DNA synthesis. Here we investigate how γ complex uses its ATPase activity for clamp loading. To assemble β on DNA the γ complex must bind β as well as DNA, open the β ring and place it around DNA, and finally dissociate from the complex to allow polymerase access to the clamp. The question is: what powers various steps in the clamp loading pathway or, alternately, how is energy from ATP binding and hydrolysis used for clamp loading? Initially we used an ATPase-inactive γ complex to investigate the role of ATP in clamp loading. Mutants of the clamp loader subunits δ and γ had been prepared previously to determine which subunit harbors the ATPase activity essential for clamp loading (40Xiao H.

This process serves specialized functions in signal transduction and receptor regulation, raising the question of whether B2ARs are associated with biochemically specialized membrane vesicles during their endocytic trafficking. Here we show that B2ARs are endocytosed by a distinct subpopulation of clathrin-coated pits, which represent a limited subset of coated pits present in the plasma membrane, even in cells overexpressing both B2ARs and β-arrestin. Coated pits mediating agonist-induced endocytosis of B2ARs differ from other coated pits mediating constitutive endocytosis of transferrin receptors in their temperature dependence for fission from the plasma membrane and in the association of their membrane coats with β-arrestin. Endocytosis of these coated pits generates endocytic vesicles selectively enriched in B2ARs, which fuse within ∼10 min after their formation with a common population of endosomes containing both B2ARs and transferrin receptors. These observations demonstrate, for the first time, the existence of a functionally and biochemically distinct subpopulation of clathrin-coated pits that mediate the agonist-regulated endocytosis of G-protein-coupled receptors, and they suggest a new model for the formation of compositionally specialized membrane vesicles at the earliest stage of the endocytic pathway. β-2 Adrenergic receptors (B2ARs) are endocytosed by clathrin-coated pits.

G-protein-coupled receptor β-2 adrenergic receptor transferrin receptor mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein Tris-buffered saline. Many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),1 such as the β-2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR), are endocytosed by clathrin-coated pits and follow an endocytic pathway similar to constitutively endocytosed nutrient receptors (such as the transferrin receptor (TfnR)) (1von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18448-18452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Goodman O.J. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis delivers both classes of receptor to endosomes, where ligand-receptor dissociation and protein sorting occur (4Pearse B.M. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). However, in addition to these conserved functions of the early endocytic pathway, clathrin-mediated endocytosis serves specialized functions in GPCR regulation and signal transduction. Endocytosis of certain GPCRs, such as the B2AR, promotes dephosphorylation and functional resensitization of receptors following agonist-induced desensitization (5Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 6Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, clathrin-mediated endocytosis also plays an important role in promoting receptor-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (7Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Endocytosis by clathrin-coated pits serves specialized functions for other types of membrane proteins, such as synaptic vesicle membrane proteins and certain membrane transporters. In these cases, the specialized functions of the endocytic pathway are mediated by the formation of distinct endomembrane vesicles (e.g. synaptic vesicles and Glut4-containing vesicles), which diverge from a common early endosomal intermediate and contain a compositionally refined subset of membrane proteins (8Clift O.L. Linstedt A.D. Lowe A.W. Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Cameron P.L. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. De C.P. J.

James D.E. Rice J.E. Hanpeter D. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Accordingly, these considerations raise the question of whether the endocytic trafficking of GPCRs may also involve specialized membranes. However, in contrast to synaptic vesicle membrane proteins, which are sorted after endocytosis to vesicles distinct from those containing TfnRs, B2ARs and TfnRs colocalize extensively in recycling endosomes (12von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if specialized endocytic membranes containing GPCRs exist, at what point in the endocytic pathway are these vesicles generated, and how is the intracellular trafficking of these vesicles related to the conserved recycling pathway? We have addressed these questions by performing a detailed comparison of the endocytic membrane trafficking of B2ARs and TfnRs in the same cells. Our studies indicate that whereas internalized B2ARs and TfnRs are extensively colocalized in recycling endosomes, B2ARs differ significantly from TfnRs at earlier stages of endocytic membrane trafficking. These studies establish, for the first time, that functionally distinguishable subpopulations of clathrin-coated pits exist in the plasma membrane of nonpolarized cells. Several epitope-tagged versions of the cloned human β-2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR (13Kobilka B.K. Dixon R.A. Frielle T. Dohlman H.G. Bolanowski M.A. Sigal I.S. Yang F.T. Francke U. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar)) were used in these studies: mutant receptors containing an HA or FLAG epitope in the amino-terminal extracellular domain (HAB2AR or SFB2AR, respectively) were described previously and demonstrated to be functional (12von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mutant receptor containing a FLAG epitope in the amino-terminal extracellular domain and an EE epitope in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain (SFB2EE) was constructed by appending a sequence encoding the EE epitope (EEEEYMPME) followed by a stop codon immediately at the 3′-end of the cDNA coding sequence of the SFB2AR. This was accomplished by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the polymerase chain reaction (Vent polymerase, New England Biolabs). Receptor cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The SFB2EE receptor, like the HAB2AR and SFB2AR described previously (12von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mediated agonist-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase when expressed in transfected 293 cells to a similar extent as the wild type B2AR (data not shown), indicating that epitope tagging in this manner did not disturb the functionality of the receptor protein. Human embryonal kidney 293 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (University of California San Francisco Cell Culture Facility). Stably transfected cells expressing epitope tagged B2ARs were generated by transfecting 293 cells in 6-cm dishes with ∼5 μg of plasmid DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation, and cell clones expressing transfected receptors were selected in 200 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell clones expressing comparable amounts of receptor protein (500–1000 fmol/mg) were selected for further study. HeLa cell lines expressing wild type or dominant negative mutant (K44A) dynamin I under the regulatable tetracycline promoter (kindly provided by Dr. S. Schmid) were grown as described (15Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 400 μg/ml Geneticin, 1× Pen/Strep, 200 ng/ml puromycin, and 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Receptors were expressed in these cells by transient transfection. Cells grown in 6-cm dishes were transfected with ∼5 μg of plasmid DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation. Dynamin expression was induced 24 h after transfection by removing tetracycline from the medium, and studies of receptor trafficking in these cells were conducted 48 h later. Stably transfected 293 cells expressing SFB2ARs or HeLa cells induced to express wild type or K44A dynamin and transiently transfected with SFB2ARs were grown on glass coverslips (Corning) and serum-starved at 37 or 16 °C for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml of Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes) and M1 anti-FLAG antibody (3 μg/ml, Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems) at 4 °C for 30 min to label TfnRs and B2ARs, respectively, and then cells were warmed to 16 or 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 10 μm isoproterenol (Research Biochemicals). Following this incubation, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 10 min and then quenched with three washes of TBS + 1 mm CaCl2. Specimens were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in Blotto (3% dry milk in TBS + 1 mm CaCl2) and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min to detect FLAG-tagged receptors. Conventional fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon 60X NA1.4 objective and epifluorescence optics; confocal fluorescence microscopy was carried out using a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 and a Zeiss 100X NA1.3 objective. For time lapse studies, stably transfected cells expressing SFB2ARs were plated on coverslips and incubated at 4 °C in the presence of M1 anti-FLAG antibody (3 μg/ml) directly conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes) using standard methods (16Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 340-355Google Scholar) and Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (50 ng/ml) for 30 min to label B2ARs and TfnRs, respectively, present in the plasma membrane. Isoproterenol was included in this incubation at a saturating concentration (10 μm) to activate B2ARs, and then cells were rapidly warmed by placing the coverslip directly on a 37 °C heat block for 2 min to initiate a pulse of receptor endocytosis. Cells were washed three times for 5 min with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 5 mm EDTA to strip antibody bound to receptors remaining in the plasma membrane and thereby selectively label endocytosed receptors. Then, the coverslips were quickly transferred onto glass slides prewarmed to 37 °C and transferred to an inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon 60x NA1.4 objective, mercury arc lamp illumination, and standard fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red dichroic filter sets (Chroma). Images of receptor movement in warmed cells were collected in time-lapse mode at the lowest practical illumination intensity using a 12-bit cooled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments) interfaced to a Macintosh computer. For colocalization of receptors with β-arrestin, a GFP-tagged version of arrestin-3 (β-arrestin-2), which has been shown previously to be functional and associate with clathrin-coated pits (17Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), was expressed in HAB2AR cells by transient transfection and studied 48–72 h after transfection. Cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μm isoproterenol at 37 °C for 30 min to drive endocytosis and recycling of the B2AR to steady state (12von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then cells were chilled on ice to stop membrane trafficking. B2ARs or TfnRs present in the plasma membrane were specifically labeled in nonpermeabilized cells using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3 μg/ml, Babco) or B3/25 monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim), respectively. Arrestin-3 localization was visualized in formaldehyde-fixed cells by GFP fluorescence, and B2AR or TfnR localization was visualized in the same cells using Cy-3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Stably transfected 293 cells expressing SFB2EE were grown in 6-cm dishes, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and biotinylated with 300 μg/ml sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Unreacted biotin was quenched and removed by three washes with ice-cold TBS at 4 °C. Biotinylated cells were then transferred to prewarmed medium (37 or 16 °C) ± 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min to assay endocytosis, and then cells were again chilled on ice to stop membrane trafficking. Biotin attached to proteins still remaining on the cell surface was cleaved by washing cells twice at 4 °C with glutathione strip buffer (50 mm glutathione, 75 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, 10% fetal bovine serum in H2O). Cells were then washed twice for 15 min at 4 °C with iodoacetamide buffer (50 mm iodoacetamide, 1% BSA in PBS, 7.4) to quench residual glutathione and cap free sulfhydryl groups present on proteins. Cells were then extracted with Triton X-100 extraction buffer (0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml, pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml iodoacetamide), and extracts were clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (12,000 ×g for 10 min) prior to immunoprecipitation of receptors. SFB2EE or TfnRs were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using ∼4 μg/ml anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems) or B3/25 monoclonal antibody2 (Boehringer Mannheim), respectively, and 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). B3/25 immunoprecipitations required the addition of ∼8 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse linker antibody because this antibody subtype (IgG1) does not bind to protein A beads with high efficiency. Immunoprecipitations were washed sequentially with HSB (0.1% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl), 1 m NaCl in HSB, and low salt wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 7.5). Washed beads were extracted with SDS sample buffer, and eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations, Inc.) and blocked for 30 min in Blotto (5% dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS). Biotinylated proteins were then complexed with horseradish peroxidase by incubating membranes with VectaStain ABC detection system (Vector Laboratories), and biotinylated proteins were detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Band intensities were quantitated by densitometry of films exposed in the linear range, imaged using a charge-coupled device camera, and analyzed using National Institutes of Health Image software. Stably transfected cells expressing HAB2ARs were grown on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips and preincubated at 37 or 16 °C for 30 min. Cells were then treated with 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min and subsequently chilled to 4 °C for 15 min. HAB2ARs and TfnRs present in the plasma membrane were specifically labeled by incubating intact cells at 4 °C in the presence of a saturating concentration of rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (∼10 μg/ml, Babco) and B3/25 antibody (8 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound antibodies were washed away with two washes of ice-cold PBS. Plasma membranes were ripped away from the cells grown on coverslips using a technique adapted from Sanan and Anderson (18Sanan D.A. Anderson R.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, coverslips supporting antibody labeled cells were chilled in an ice water bath, and another poly-l-lysine-coated coverslip was laid on top of that. Slight pressure was applied through the use of a rubber stopper, and the top coverslip, now with the plasma membrane attached, was ripped away. The top coverslip was immediately fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Following fixation, plasma membrane specimens were blocked with Blotto (3% dry milk, 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS) and incubated with donkey anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate and donkey anti-rabbit Texas Red secondary antibodies (both at 1:500 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch) to specifically detect TfnRs and HAB2ARs, respectively, present in the plasma membrane. For colocalization of B2ARs with clathrin, surface-labeled plasma membranes (with rabbit anti-HA antibody) were ripped, fixed, and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of X.22 (gift from Dr. F. Brodsky) (19Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2047-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), followed by species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated with different fluorochromes (as described above). Control experiments using specimens labeled with single primary antibodies confirmed the immunochemical specificity of the staining procedure and verified the absence of bleedthrough between channels. Specimens were examined by fluorescence microscopy, and images were collected using a cooled charge-coupled device camera. Images were then written to 8-bit data sets using a linear lookup table to allow image registration and quantitation of clusters using National Institutes of Health Image software and to facilitate the display of merged color images using Adobe PhotoShop. B2AR immunoreactivity visualized in plasma membrane sheets prepared from untreated cells was evenly distributed over the entire specimen, without any clusters varying >50% from the mean staining intensity averaged over the plasma membrane fragment. The intensity of this unclustered fluorescence staining was ≥9-fold over nonspecific background. The fluorescence intensity of B2AR clusters in isoproterenol-treated cells was typically >5-fold greater than that observed in unclustered regions and was always >20-fold greater than background. B2AR clusters (defined above) were identified in dual labeled specimens, and compared with the pattern of clathrin or TfnR immunoreactivity observed in the other fluorescence channel. Clusters of B2AR were scored clathrin or TfnR-positive if a cluster of clathrin immunoreactivity (more than 10-fold brighter than background) or TfnR immunoreactivity (more than 2-fold brighter than background) was centered within 2 pixels of the center of the B2AR cluster, which was judged to be the resolution limits of our optical system. Clathrin or TfnR clusters (defined above) were scored to be B2AR-positive if a cluster of B2AR immunoreactivity >2-fold greater than the fluorescence staining intensity of the surrounding area was centered within 2 pixels of the center of the clathrin or TfnR cluster. SFB2EE cells were grown on 15-cm plates and treated for 2, 5, or 15 min with 10 μm isoproterenol at 37 °C. Cell monolayers were then quickly chilled to 4 °C, equilibrated at this temperature for 10 min, and washed twice with isotonic HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 255 mmsucrose). Cells were harvested with 1.0 ml per plate of HES + 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma) by scraping with a rubber policeman, and a homogenate was prepared by five strokes in an ice-cold Dounce homogenizer. Unbroken cells, nuclei, and the majority of plasma membrane fragments were removed by differential centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and a light membrane fraction was prepared that included the majority of endocytic vesicles. Aliquots of this membrane fraction (3 mg of protein in 1 ml of HES + protease inhibitors) were incubated with 5 μg of EE antibody for 2.5 h at 4 °C. A goat anti-mouse linker antibody (10 μg, Jackson ImmunoResearch) was added to the samples and incubated for an additional 2.5 h at 4 °C. Antibody-bound membranes were isolated by adding 25 μl of fixedStaphylococcus aureus cells (Pansorbin, Calbiochem), washed twice with HES, and resuspended in 200 μl of HES. Analysis of this fraction indicated that it is highly enriched in B2AR-containing endosomes and contains very low levels of residual plasma membrane (as determined by recovery of only trace amounts of biotinylated plasma membrane proteins in this fraction). Saturation radioligand binding assays were performed on the immunoisolates using [3H]dihydroalprenolol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as tracer and alprenolol (1 μm) to define nonspecific binding (which was <10% of total binding in all cases), as described previously (12von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of B2AR-containing endosomes, as determined by B max estimates derived from radioligand binding assay, were solubilized with 25 μl of SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blotted for B2AR using biotinylated M1 antibodies (prepared by standard methods using Sulfo-NHS biotin; Pierce) B2ARs were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-biotin secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In all experiments, equal amounts of B2AR estimated from radioligand binding assay corresponded to equal amounts of receptor protein detected by Western blotting. For detection of TfnRs, blots were probed with H68.4 antibody (a gift from Dr. Ian Trowbridge) (20White S. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and ECL detection. Relative amounts of TfnR present in B2AR-containing endosomes isolated at various times after endocytosis were quantitated by densitometry of TfnR immunoreactivity detected in Western blots of immunoisolates loaded according to equal B2AR content. Agonist-induced endocytosis of B2ARs in 293 cells has been reported previously to be mediated by clathrin-coated pits and a similar vesicular pathway as that of constitutive endocytosis and recycling of TfnRs (1von Zastrow M.

Consistent with this, in the presence of the adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, epitope-tagged B2ARs were translocated within minutes from the plasma membrane to endocytic vesicles (Fig. 1, compare panels a and b), many of which contained endocytosed transferrin (Fig. 1, b and e). Endocytosis of both receptors was undetectable in cells incubated at 4 °C (not shown). However, significant differences were observed in the temperature dependence of B2AR and TfnR endocytosis at intermediate temperatures. In particular, endocytosis of B2ARs was undetectable in cells incubated at 16 °C, even in the presence of 10 μm of isoproterenol (Fig. 1 c). This is a saturating concentration of agonist that strongly activates receptors at 16 °C, as determined by assay of receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase and agonist-induced phosphorylation of receptors at this temperature (not shown). In contrast to the failure of B2ARs to endocytose at 16 °C, endocytosis of TfnRs was readily observed at this temperature in the same cells. This was indicated by the bright punctate staining of endocytic vesicles containing internalized Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (Fig. 1 f). These puncta were confirmed to represent endocytic vesicles, rather than clusters in the plasma membrane, both by optical sectioning using confocal microscopy and because they were resistant to stripping under conditions that remove labeled transferrin from the cell surface (not shown). This difference in the temperature dependence for endocytosis of B2ARs and TfnRs was observed in multiple clones of stably transfected cells, as well as in transiently transfected cells expressing different levels of receptor protein. A similar assay was used to compare the endocytosis of B2ARs and TfnRs in HeLa cells, in order to determine whether the selective blockade of B2AR endocytosis observed at 16 °C is unique to 293 cells or whether it reflects a general property of receptor endocytosis. As in 293 cells, endocytosed B2ARs and TfnRs visualized in agonist-stimulated HeLa cells were observed in a similar population of endocytic membranes, many of which could be colocalized by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2, a and d). Furthermore, endocytosis of both receptors was specifically inhibited by K44A mutant dynamin I (Fig. 2, band e), supporting the hypothesis that both receptors are endocytosed by clathrin-coated pits (15Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 22Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) in HeLa cells as in 293 cells. However, as observed in 293 cells, endocytosis of B2ARs was undetectable by this assay in cells incubated at 16 °C, whereas endocytosis of TfnRs was readily observed at this temperature in the same cells (Fig. 2, c and f). The selective blockade of B2AR endocytosis at 16 °C was confirmed using a biochemical assay to measure endocytosis of B2ARs and TfnRs in the same stably transfected 293 cells. Both B2ARs and TfnRs, analyzed by specific immunoprecipitation from the same cell lysates, were readily detected in the plasma membrane of surface-biotinylated 293 cells. B2ARs resolved as a glycosylated band resolving with an apparent molecular mass between 60 and 80 kDa, whereas TfnRs resolved at ∼190 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3, lane 1, top and bottom panels, respectively). Biotin was cleaved quantitatively in the presence of a membrane-impermeant reducing agent (Fig. 3, lane 2), allowing endocytosis of both receptors to be detected in the same cells by their resistance to cleavage under these conditions. Using this highly sensitive biochemical assay, a small amount of B2AR endocytosis was observed in the absence of agonist (Fig. 3, lane 3, top panel), which was strongly stimulated in the presence of isoproterenol (lane 4, top panel). Constitutive endocytosis of TfnRs was readily detectable in the same cell lysates, both in cells incubated in the absence and presence of isoproterenol (lanes 3 and 4, bottom panel). In cells incubated at 16 °C, agonist-induced endocytosis of B2ARs was completely blocked (Fig. 3, lane 6, top panel). In contrast, endocytosis of TfnRs was readily detectable and was only partially inhibited relative to that observed at 37 °C (comparelanes 3 and 4 to lanes 5 and 6, bottom panel). These results were quantitated in multiple experiments using densitometric scanning of films exposed in the linear range. This analysis confirmed a complete (∼95%) inhibition of agonist-induced endocytosis of B2ARs at 16 °C. No agonist-induced endocytosis was detected when assays were conducted for different time periods ranging from 15 min to 1 h (not shown), further confirming that the inhibition of agonist-induced endocytosis of B2ARs observed at 16 °C represents an essentially complete blockad"

The enzymatic activity of ectoapyrase is inhibited by most detergents used for membrane protein solubilization. In contrast, the enzymatic activities of soluble E-type ATPases, including potato tuber (Solanum tuberosum) apyrase and parasite ecto-ATPase, are not affected by detergents. Here we show that ectoapyrase is a tetramer and that detergents that reduce the activity of the enzyme promote dissociation of the tetramer to monomers. We expressed a secreted form of the ectoapyrase in COS-7 cells by fusing the signal peptide of murine CD4 with the extracellular domain of the ectoapyrase. The soluble ectoapyrase is catalytically active and its activity is not affected by detergents. Mutants of the ectoapyrase with only the NH2- or the COOH-terminal transmembrane domain are membrane-bound, and their activity is no longer affected by detergents. The enzymatic activity of all of the mutant proteins is less than that of the native enzyme. These results suggest that the proper contacts between the transmembrane domains of the monomers in the tetramer are necessary for full enzymatic activity.

Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1189-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) are also encoded by genes similar to that for CD39. These latter enzymes hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphates at less than 10% of the rate of ATP hydrolysis (15Kegel B. Braun N. Heine P. Maliszewski C.R. Zimmermann H. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1189-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Mammalian ectoapyrases (CD39) are integral membrane proteins with two transmembrane domains (one at each end of the protein), small cytoplasmic NH2- and COOH-terminal segments, and a large extracellular domain (11Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.J.T. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K. Birks C. Alpert A. Friend D. Gimpel S.D. Gayle III, R.B. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9898-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This arrangement is unusual for ecto-enzymes, since these are usually attached to the membrane by a single protein or lipid link (16Semenza G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 255-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kyte J. Structure in Protein Chemistry. 1995; (, Garland, New York): 520Google Scholar); however, it has been found in a class of channels and pores (for a review, see Ref.18North R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this paper, we consider whether the transmembrane domains of the ectoapyrase are required for or have an effect on the enzymatic activity of the ectoapyrase. We describe the construction of three mutant cDNAs whose expression produces a secreted soluble protein and membrane proteins lacking either the NH2- or the COOH-terminal transmembrane domains. All of the mutant proteins are enzymatically active, and their activities are not affected by nonionic detergents. However, the specific activities of the mutant proteins are substantially less than that of the native protein. We show that ectoapyrase (CD39) is a noncovalent tetrameric protein and that detergent inhibition of enzymatic activity is caused by dissociation of ectoapyrase tetramers into monomers. We conclude that the interactions between the transmembrane segments of the ectoapyrase monomers in the tetramer regulate the enzymatic activity of the protein. Nucleotides, bovine thyroglobulin,Escherichia coli β-galactosidase, bovine catalase, bovine heart lactate dehydrogenase, bovine serum albumin, sodium cholate, and potato tuber (Solanum tuberosum) apyrase were purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and l-glutamine were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Flavobacterium meningosepticiumglycopeptidase F, high purity digitonin, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Calbiochem. Murine CD4 cDNA clone was kindly provided by Dr. Leslie J. Berg (Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). Rat ectoapyrase (CD39) cDNA had been previously described (12Wang T-F. Rosenberg P.A. Guidotti G. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 47: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To construct the hexahistidine-tagged soluble CD39 (sCD39his) cDNA, a DNA fragment encoding the murine CD4 signal peptide and cleavage site sequence (MCRAISLRRLLLLLLQLSQLLAVTQGKTLVLGKEGES (19Littman D.R. Gettner S.N. Nature. 1987; 325: 453-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)) was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR),1 fused with the extracellular part of rat CD39 cDNA (amino acid residues 39–470). Two more amino acids, NS, were introduced by an EcoRI cloning site between the CD4 signal peptide and CD39 protein. Six histidine residues were added at the COOH terminus for protein purification with HisBind resin (Novagen, Madison, WI). The PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). To construct the recombinant baculovirus transfer vector, the MaxBac 2.0 Baculovirus expression vector system from Invitrogen was used. The sCD39his DNA insert was excised from pcDNA3 and subcloned into pBlueBac4.5 vector downstream of the strong polyhedrin promoter. The recombinant transfer vector was cotransfected with a baculovirus that had deletions in essential parts of the virus genome (supplied by Invitrogen). Positive recombinant baculovirus with both blue color and occlusion body negative phenotype were selected by a standard plaque assay. The DNA of the recombinant virus was isolated and analyzed by PCR. Recombinant virus stock was amplified by culturing infected cells several times, and a high titer virus solution was harvested. The COOH-terminal deletion mutant (CD39CT) was generated by PCR amplification of the rat brain ectoapyrase cDNA (amino acid residues 1–470). The NH2-terminal deletion mutant (CD39NT), which lacks the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic sequence and first transmembrane domain, was constructed by connecting the cDNA for the murine CD4 signal peptide and cleavage sequence with the cDNA for the ectoapyrase lacking the first 38 amino acids (amino acid residues 39–512) (12Wang T-F. Rosenberg P.A. Guidotti G. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 47: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged proteins (CD39WT-Myc, CD39CT-Myc, and CD39NT-Myc) were constructed by PCR with an oligonucleotide cassette encoding the Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) fused to the COOH terminus of wild type CD39 (CD39WT), CD39CT, and CD39NT. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into the pCI-neo expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) for expression in COS-7 cells. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells were grown in a serum-free insect medium (EX-CELL 401 from JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and infected with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 3. Culture medium was collected between 72 and 90 h after infection, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was applied to a 3-ml concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B column (Sigma) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer A (25 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.0, and 50 μm CaCl2). Ca2+ ion was added to maintain apyrase activity. The concanavalin A-binding glycoproteins were then eluted with 30 ml of 1 m α-methylmannoside (Sigma) in buffer A. The eluate was applied to a 1.5-ml HisBind resin column, washed with 15 ml of buffer A and then with 1.5 ml of buffer A containing 1 mm imidazole to remove nonspecific binding proteins. The hexahistidine-tagged sCD39his protein was eluted by 6 ml of elution buffer (25 mm Tris-buffered saline, 50 μm CaCl2, and 0.5 m imidazole) and then dialyzed overnight against 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 μm CaCl2. About 1 mg of protein, determined by Peterson's method (20Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7113) Google Scholar), was isolated from 600 ml of insect cell culture. The purified protein preparation was analyzed by 7.5% reducing SDS-PAGE and blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The soluble ectoapyrase was visualized by Ponceau S staining (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 494Google Scholar) and then excised for trypsin digestion and NH2-terminal peptide sequence determination. NH2-terminal peptide sequencing was done by William S. Lane (Harvard University Microsequencing Facility, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). The purified soluble sCD39his protein (10 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 100 μl of 0.4 mm [14C]FSBA (specific activity, 50 μCi/μmol), 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 50 μm CaCl2. FSBA is an ATP analogue (22Ohta T. Nagano K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2071-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and an inhibitor of ectoapyrase (23Sévigny J. Coté Y.P. Beaudoin A.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ATP (final concentration 4 mm) was added with [14C]FSBA to block labeling. The reactions were stopped by adding 50 μl of reducing sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 65 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8). The samples were boiled, analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and examined by autoradiography. Rabbit anti-rat ectoapyrase (CD39) antiserum used in immunoblotting has been previously described (12Wang T-F. Rosenberg P.A. Guidotti G. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 47: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). F. meningosepticium glycopeptidase F was used to deglycosylate asparagine-linked glycans (24Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transfected with wild type or mutant recombinant CD39 cDNAs were harvested and lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 15 min. The COS-7 cell lysates were boiled for 10 min in 100 μl of a solution with 10 mm Na phosphate (pH 8.2), 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% SDS. The denatured protein mixtures were then incubated with or without F. meningosepticium glycopeptidase F (0.5 unit) for 20 h. COS-7 cells grown on polylysine-coated culture chamber slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) were transfected at ∼40–60% confluence with CD39CT-Myc or CD39WT-Myc cDNA, using the LipofectAMINE method. The immunofluorescence staining was done by modifying the method described by Yoon and Guidotti (25Yoon K.L. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28249-28258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For staining permeabilized cells, cells were fixed 2 days after transfection with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody at 1 μg/ml concentration and with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) at a dilution of 1:1000. Immunofluorescence was viewed with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. For staining nonpermeabilized cells, the first antibody was incubated directly without fixation of cells, and fixation was done after incubation with the secondary antibody. All of the incubation and washing steps were done in the absence of detergents. Crude membranes of the transfected COS-7 cells were prepared by the method of Coppi and Guidotti (26Coppi M.V. Guidotti G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), except thatN-ethylmaleimide was added to a final concentration of 2 mm to the hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm sucrose) to prevent intermolecular disulfide bond formation during the preparations. Crude membranes from four 100-mm plates of transfected COS-7 cells were resuspended in 0.8 ml of buffer (10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). 100-μl crude membranes were solubilized with detergent (1% final concentration of digitonin or Triton X-100 or 2% final concentration of cholate), incubated on ice for 30 min, and used immediately for velocity sedimentation. The procedure was performed as described by Lu and Guidotti (27Lu K. Guidotti G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Marker proteins (50 μg each) were added to detergent solubilized COS-7 crude membrane and then layered onto 10.0 ml of a linear 5–25% (w/v) sucrose density gradient containing detergent (0.2% digitonin, 0.2% Triton X-100, or 1% cholate), 50 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 7.2). The samples were centrifuged for 15 h at 34,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW40Ti rotor (Fullerton, CA). In some experiments, the samples were applied to 4.8 ml of a linear 5–20% (w/v) sucrose density gradient and then centrifuged for 15 h at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. Fractions of 300 μl were collected from the bottom of the tubes. A portion of each fraction (25–50 μl) was used to determine Ca2+-dependent apyrase activity in 200 μl of reaction buffer containing 1 mm ADP (Tris-buffered, pH 7.4), 20 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm NaN3, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmEGTA. The Ca2+-stimulated ADPase activity was determined by subtracting values obtained with EGTA alone from those with 1.5 mm CaCl2 plus chelator and by measuring the inorganic phosphate released as described by Ames (28Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-117Crossref Scopus (3013) Google Scholar). The positions of protein markers were determined by 7.5% reducing SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The sedimentation coefficients of the detergent-solubilized ectoapyrases were determined by comparison with those of the marker proteins, which were thyroglobulin (19.4 S), β-galactosidase (15.9 S), catalase (11.3 S), lactate dehydrogenase (7.3 S), and bovine serum albumin (4.4 S) (29Edsall J.T. CRC Handbook of Biochemistry: Selected Data for Molecular Biology. The Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, OH1970: C10-C35Google Scholar, 30Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5459-5469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sedimentation coefficients were then used to estimate molecular weight based on the results of Liu and Guidotti (31Liu J.Y. Guidotti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 370-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Triton X-100-solubilized ectoapyrase monomers (100 μl of fraction 13 in Fig. 6 B) were layered onto 4.8 ml of a linear 5–20% (w/v) sucrose density gradient containing 0.2% digitonin and 50 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 7.2) and centrifuged for 15 h at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. Fractions of 300 μl were collected from the bottom of the tubes. The Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity was determined as described above. The total Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity of tetrameric ectoapyrase was integrated and compared with that of the monomeric ectoapyrase added to the gradient tube. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking was performed as described by Liu and Guidotti (31Liu J.Y. Guidotti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 370-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with some modification. Glutaraldehyde (0–8 mm final concentration) (Polyscience, Warrington, PA) was incubated with crude membrane (25 μl), soluble ectoapyrase (3 μg), or fractions from the sedimentation experiments (50 μl) in phosphate-buffered saline (final volume, 100 μl). Following a 2–10-min incubation at room temperature, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 0.6 m glycine (pH 9.0). The cross-linked ectoapyrase products were separated by 5.5% nonreducing SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-CD39 antibody. To measure ectoapyrase activity, COS-7 cells (105 cells) or crude membranes (12 μg) were resuspended in 180 μl of buffer A (20 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm EGTA) with or without 1% detergent (Triton X-100 or digitonin) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The nucleoside phosphatase reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 μl of the same buffer containing 10 mmATP. The divalent cation stimulated apyrase activity was determined by measuring the inorganic phosphate released (28Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-117Crossref Scopus (3013) Google Scholar) and by subtracting values obtained with EGTA alone from those with 1.5 mmCaCl2 plus chelator (5Wang T-F. Guidotti G. J. Biol.

A characteristic feature of vertebrate ectoapyrases is the sensitivity of their enzymatic activities to most detergents. In contrast, the enzymatic activities of soluble E-type ATPases, including potato tuber (S. tuberosum) apyrase 2M. Handa, personal communication. and parasite ecto-ATPases (9Bermudes J.G. Peck K.R.

Since the principal difference between the structures of the mammalian ectoapyrases (detergent-sensitive) and the soluble apyrases (detergent-resistant) is the presence of transmembrane segments in the former proteins, we considered that the interaction of the detergents with the transmembrane domains was central for detergent sensitivity. One possible effect of detergents is the dissociation of protein oligomers. The proposal that the oligomeric state of the ecto-ATPase affects its enzymatic activity was made previously (33Sabbadini R.A. Dahams A.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 163-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To answer the question about the relationship of the transmembrane domains to the oligomeric state of the protein and its sensitivity to detergents, we made variants of the ectoapyrase with one or no transmembrane domains. The isolation of a cDNA for rat brain ectoapyrase and its expression in COS-7 cells has been described in a previous paper (12Wang T-F. Rosenberg P.A. Guidotti G. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 47: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We constructed a soluble ectoapyrase, sCD39his (Fig. 1), by fusion of the murine CD4 signal peptide and cleavage sequence (MCRAISLRRLLLLLLQLSQLLAVTQGKTLVLGKEGES) (19Littman D.R. Gettner S.N. Nature. 1987; 325: 453-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with the extracellular part of rat ectoapyrase (amino acid residues 39–470) (12Wang T-F. Rosenberg P.A. Guidotti G. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 47: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cleavage site of the CD4 signal peptide is between glycine and lysine (underlined above). S. frugiperda Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant sCD39his cDNA baculovirus, and the culture medium was collected after 72–90 h. The soluble ectoapyrase was purified by elution from columns of concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B and HisBind resin (see “Experimental Procedures”). The purified protein had a Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity of 68 μmol of Pi/min/mg of protein. [14C]FSBA, a competitive inhibitor of ectoapyrase (23Sévigny J. Coté Y.P. Beaudoin A.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), labeled a protein with M r ∼56,000 (Fig. 2 A). Anti-CD39 antibody also recognized a protein with the same molecular weight by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 B). The NH2-terminal peptide sequence of this 56-kDa protein is XTLVL. The first amino acid residue (X) was not identified, but the next four amino acid residues are consistent with the sequence expected for cleavage of the CD4 signal peptide between Gly and Lys. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of four tryptic peptides also revealed that this 56-kDa protein has the same amino acid sequences as the wild type ectoapyrase protein (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that the soluble ectoapyrase is secreted and catalytically active. Finally, Coomassie Blue staining of a gel after SDS-PAGE indicated that the 56-kDa protein was the major component (>50% of the total protein) of the purified product (Fig. 2 C). Accordingly, the apyrase activity of this 60-kDa protein was estimated to be ∼100–200 μmol of Pi/min/mg of protein.Figure 2Expression of soluble ectoapyrase (sCD39his) in insect cells.

They both hydrolyze nucleotide di- and triphosphates but not nucleotide monophosphates. The relative hydrolysis rates of the soluble ectoapyrase for various nucleotide phosphates were 100 ± 2% (ATP), 57 ± 4% (ADP), 85 ± 5% (dATP), and 0 ± 1% (AMP), similar to those of the ectoapyrase in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed LG2 cells (5Wang T-F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9898-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) (Table I). The soluble ectoapyrase had aK m of 220 μm for ATP (at 0.5 mm Ca+2) compared with a K mof 75 μm for the wild type enzyme. The enzymatic activity of soluble ectoapyrase was dependent on either Ca2+ or Mg2+ and was insensitive to vanadate (inhibitor of P-type ATPases) or azide (inhibitor of F-type ATPases). We conclude that neither transmembrane domains nor cytoplasmic domains are required for apyrase activity.Table ISubstrate specificity of wild type ectoapyrase (CD39) and soluble CD39SubstrateWild type CD39Soluble CD39ATP100 ± 4100 ± 2ADP58 ± 257 ± 4AMP0 ± 10 ± 1dATP95 ± 285 ± 5Soluble CD39 and human Epstein-Barr virus transformed LG2 cells were incubated in the standard solution with 1 mm NaN3and 0.5 mm Na3VO4.

We identified 12 amino acid residues in the human blue cone pigment that might induce the required green-to-blue opsin shift. The simultaneous substitution of nine of these sites in rhodopsin (M86L, G90S, A117G, E122L, A124T, W265Y, A292S, A295S, and A299C) shifted the absorption maximum from 500 to 438 nm, accounting for 2,830 cm−1, or 80%, of the opsin shift between rhodopsin and the blue cone pigment. Raman spectroscopy of mutant pigments shows that the dielectric character and architecture of the chromophore-binding pocket are specifically altered. An increase in the number of dipolar side chains near the protonated Schiff base of retinal increases the ground-excited state energy gap via long range dipole-dipole Coulomb interaction. In addition, the W265Y substitution causes a decrease in solvent polarizability near the chromophore ring structure. Finally, two substitutions on transmembrane helix 3 (A117G and E122L) act in combination with the other substitutions to alter the binding-pocket structure, resulting in stronger interaction of the protonated Schiff base group with the surrounding dipolar groups and the counterion.

At the fundamental level, the ability of the visual system to discriminate wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation is determined by the spectral response of the light-absorbing pigments that reside in the photoreceptor cells of the retina. Trichromatic color vision in humans is mediated by three types of cone cells, each of which contains a specific visual pigment. The blue, green, and red cone pigments absorb maximally at ∼425, 533, and 560 nm, respectively (1Lythgoe J.N. Dartnall H.J. Handbook of Sensory Physiology. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1972: 604-624Google Scholar, 2Merbs S.L. Nathans J. Nature. 1992; 356: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 3Oprian D.D. Asenjo A.B. Lee N. Pelletier S.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11367-11372Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Dim-light (scotopic) vision is mediated through rod photoreceptor cells containing the pigment rhodopsin with its absorption maximum (λmax) at 500 nm (4Wald G. Brown P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1953; 37: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). All visual pigments share the same basic structure. The protein consists of an ∼40-kDa polypeptide domain folded into seven transmembrane (TM)1 helical segments. It is covalently bound to an 11-cis-retinal chromophore at a conserved lysine residue on TM helix 7 via a protonated Schiff base (PSB) bond (5Wald G.

However, its λmax can range from ∼420 to 560 nm in visual pigments due to interactions with residues in the binding site of the protein, which modulate the ground-excited electronic (S 0-S 1) transition energy of the retinal PSB. The difference in the λmax of the pigment from that of the PSB model compound has been termed the “opsin shift” (8Nakanishi K. Balogh-Nair V. Arnaboldi M. Tsujimoto K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 7947-7949Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar), which is also used to refer to the differences in the λmax values among pigments. Empirical and theoretical studies have identified several mechanisms by which opsin shift may occur. In the visual pigments, the chief possible mechanisms include the following: 1) a change in the strength of the electrostatic interaction between the PSB group of the chromophore and its counterion or hydrogen-bond acceptor (9Blatz P.E. Mohler J.H. Navangul H.V. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 848-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 10Kakitani H. Kakitani T. Rodman H. Honig B. Photochem. Photobiol. 1985; 41: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); 2) a placement of full or partial charges along the polyene (10Kakitani H. Kakitani T. Rodman H. Honig B. Photochem.

Soc. 1979; 101: 7084-7086Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar); 3) an alteration in the polarity or polarizability of the environment of the chromophore-binding site (12Irving C.S. Byers G.W. Leermakers P.A. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,13Beppu Y. Kakitani T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1994; 59: 660-669Google Scholar); and 4) twisting along bonds of the polyene chain (10Kakitani H. Kakitani T. Rodman H. Honig B. Photochem. Photobiol. 1985; 41: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The retinal chromophore and its protein environment have been studied extensively in bovine rhodopsin using mutagenesis and biophysical methods. A key residue is the glutamic acid at position 113 on TM helix 3. Glu113 is ionized in the ground state of rhodopsin and functions as the counterion to stabilize the positive charge of the PSB chromophore (14Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 15Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Science. 1989; 246: 928-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 16Nathans J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9746-9752Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It is positioned with one of its carboxylate oxygens about 3–4 Å from C-12 near the center of the polyene (17Birge R.R. Murray L.P. Pierce B.M. Akita H. Balogh-Nair V. Findsen L.A. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4117-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,18Han M. DeDecker B.S. Smith S.O. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Most of the opsin shift in rhodopsin could be explained by weaker electrostatic interaction resulting from greater separation between the PSB group and the counterion compared with that of retinal PSB in solution (19Livnah N. Sheves M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 351-353Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mechanism of spectral tuning between green- and red-sensitive pigments has also been addressed. The human green and red cone sequences share 96% sequence identity and differ at only 15 positions (20Nathans J. Thomas D. Hogness D.S. Science. 1986; 232: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). The replacement of seven of these residues in the green cone sequence by those in the red cone sequence is necessary to shift the λmax of the hybrid green pigment all the way to 560 nm (21Asenjo A.B. Rim J. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1131-1138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), but three specific substitutions of polar amino acids at TM helices 4 and 6 (A180S, F277Y, and A285T) account for the majority of this ∼1000-cm−1 opsin shift (22Neitz M. Neitz J. Jacobs G.H. Science. 1991; 252: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 23Yokoyama R. Yokoyama S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9315-9318Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The substitution of these three polar residues at analogous positions in bovine rhodopsin (A164S, F261Y, and A269T) also shifts its λmaxto the red by ∼700 cm−1 (24Chan T. Lee M. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9478-9480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent Raman spectroscopy studies of the chromophore environments in the human green and red cone pigments have provided evidence that the primary origin of the opsin shift from 533 to 560 nm is the electrostatic interaction of the dipolar residues situated near the cyclohexyl ring with the change in dipole moment of the chromophore complex (25Kochendoerfer G.G. Wang Z. Oprian D.D. Mathies R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6577-6587Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The opsin shift from 500 to 533 nm (i.e. between rhodopsin and the green cone pigment) is thought to arise from the perturbation of PSB interactions, which is mediated by the binding of a chloride ion (25Kochendoerfer G.G. Wang Z. Oprian D.D. Mathies R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6577-6587Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Wang Z. Asenjo A.B. Oprian D.D.

A. 1992; 89: 9181-9185Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although ample effort has been directed toward the issue of the green-red opsin shift, much less work has focused on the molecular mechanism of the larger opsin shift from 500 nm to the blue wavelengths. The gene for the human blue cone pigment has been cloned and sequenced (20Nathans J. Thomas D. Hogness D.S. Science. 1986; 232: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), and recombinant blue cone pigment has been expressed transiently from a synthetic gene (3Oprian D.D. Asenjo A.B. Lee N. Pelletier S.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11367-11372Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, no mutational studies have been reported on the blue cone pigment, presumably due to its low expression in mammalian cells. Measurements of its λmax range from ∼420 to 435 nm (1Lythgoe J.N. Dartnall H.J. Handbook of Sensory Physiology. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1972: 604-624Google Scholar, 2Merbs S.L. Nathans J. Nature. 1992; 356: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 3Oprian D.D. Asenjo A.B. Lee N. Pelletier S.L.

Taking a median value of 425 nm, the opsin shift between rhodopsin and the human blue cone pigment amounts to approximately 3500 cm−1. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the green-blue opsin shift, and candidate residues that may play a role in spectral tuning have been suggested. Comparative sequence analysis of blue- and green-sensitive pigments suggested that positively charged residues in the blue cone sequence, specifically arginine and histidine at positions equivalent to 107 and 108, respectively, in rhodopsin, may induce a blue shift by perturbing the PSB environment (28Yoshizawa T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Conservation of polar residues on TM helices 3 and 7 in the vicinity of the PSB also indicated that the blue shift might result from additional dipolar residues interacting with the PSB group (25Kochendoerfer G.G. Wang Z. Oprian D.D. Mathies R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6577-6587Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Chang B.S.W. Crandall K.A. Carulli J.P. Hartl D.L. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 1995; 4: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The 10-nm blue shift elicited by the substitution of a serine in place of alanine at the 292 position in rhodopsin is consistent with its role in the blue opsin shift via the latter mechanism (30Fasick J.I. Robinson P.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Sun H. Macke J.P. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

B. 1997; 264: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, a systematic mutagenesis study specifically addressing the ∼3500-cm−1 opsin shift has not yet been carried out. The identification of amino acids involved in blue spectral tuning is particularly challenging because the sequence identity between rhodopsins and blue cone pigments is only ∼46%. We report here a detailed mutagenesis study that addresses the mechanism of the green-to-blue opsin shift. We used bovine rhodopsin as a template to model the opsin shift by substituting amino acids from the human blue cone sequence at selected positions. These amino acids were identified from the alignment of bovine rhodopsin and the human, mouse, rat, and bovine blue cone sequences. A total of 12 positions in rhodopsin were evaluated. Substitutions at nine positions simultaneously (M86L, G90S, A117G, E122L, A124T, W265Y, A292S, A295S, and A299C) caused a λmax shift to ∼438 nm and accounted for approximately 2830 cm−1 (80%) of the opsin shift between the blue cone pigment and rhodopsin. Raman spectroscopy shows that the added dipolar groups by themselves modify the retinal electronic energies and induce a λmax shift by long range electrostatic effects on the change in dipole moment of the photoexcited chromophore. Furthermore, these substitutions in the presence of Gly117, Leu122, and Tyr265 residues alter the architecture of the retinal-binding pocket and produce the observed ∼60-nm blue shift. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (14Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 33Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11149-11159Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Synthetic DNA duplexes containing the desired codon alterations were ligated to the synthetic rhodopsin gene in the pMT expression vector between the following pairs of restriction sites: BglII/RsrII for mutations in TM 2, NcoI/XhoI and RsrII/SpeI for mutations in TM 3,MluI/ApaI for mutations in TM 6, and ApaI/BspeI for mutations in TM 7. The altered genes were expressed in COS-1 cells following transient transfection using LipofectAMINE or LipofectAMINE-Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS cells expressing mutant apoprotein were harvested and incubated in the presence of 11-cis-retinal at 4 °C under dim red light. The pigment was solubilized in n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside detergent (w/v 1%, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) and bound to the 1D4 immunoaffinity resin (14Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The resin was washed in wash buffer (5 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6, 5 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) tridecyl maltoside, or 0.1% dodecyl maltoside) and eluted in wash buffer supplemented with the antigenic carboxyl-terminal peptide to the 1D4 antibody (34Ridge K.D. Lu Z. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3261-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Aliquots of concentrated Tris-HCl and NaCl solutions were added to the eluted sample to bring their final concentrations to ∼40 mm (pH 6.8) and 100 mm, respectively. Absorption spectra (1-cm path length) were measured on a λ-19 Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer as described previously (33Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11149-11159Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To bleach the pigment, the sample was illuminated for a minimum of 15 s with a 150-watt halogen light source. A photobleaching difference spectrum was obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the sample in the dark from the spectrum of the irradiated sample. For Raman spectroscopy, ∼3 μl of purified pigment (25–50 μm) in a glass capillary was excited with 795-nm light from a titanium:sapphire laser (Lexel 479) (25Kochendoerfer G.G. Wang Z. Oprian D.D. Mathies R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6577-6587Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The sample was cooled by blowing nitrogen gas passed through an isopropyl alcohol/CO2(s) bath over the capillary. Scattered light at 90o from the excitation beam was detected by a CCD detector (Princeton Instruments, LN-1152) coupled to a double spectrograph (Spex 1401). Frequencies were calibrated using the Raman spectrum of cyclohexanone and the emission spectrum of neon as standards. Reported frequencies are accurate to ± 2 cm−1, and the spectral resolution is 6 cm−1. The amino acid sequences of rhodopsin and the human blue cone pigment are only approximately 46% identical (20Nathans J. Thomas D. Hogness D.S. Science. 1986; 232: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar, 28Yoshizawa T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, compared with the case for the human green and red cone opsins, determining which amino acids may shift the λmax from the green to blue wavelengths is not straightforward. In order to minimize the number of sites to be studied by mutagenesis, three basic criteria were applied to select residues that were potentially functionally important. First, the amino acid side chains should be located near the retinal chromophore, which is predicted to lie approximately near the middle of the membrane bilayer at the level of Lys296 (35Zhang H. Lerro K.A. Yamamoto T. Lien T.H. Sastry L. Gawinowicz M.A. Nakanishi K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 10165-10173Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar,36Thomas D.D. Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 154: 145-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, residues that are positioned within one turn above and below Lys296 on TM helices 2, 3, 6, and 7 in a secondary structural model (Fig. 1) were considered. Second, there should be an increase in the number of polar amino acids such as serine, threonine, or cysteine in the proximity of the Schiff base in the blue cone pigment. Data from previous Raman studies on visual pigments indicated that there was approximate positive correlation between the pigment λmax and increased electrostatic interaction of the retinal-PSB group with the surrounding protein environment (37Lin S.W. Imamoto Y. Fukada Y. Shichida Y. Yoshizawa T. Mathies R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2151-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Specifically in the blue rod pigment (λmax ∼430 nm) from the toad Bufo marinus, it was shown that the Schiff base C=N stretching frequency of the 9-cis species of its chromophore was similar to the frequency measured for a model retinal-PSB molecule stabilized by a chloride counterion in methanol (38Loppnow G.R. Barry B.A. Mathies R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This indicated that the general characteristics of the protein environment around the PSB group may be modeled by the situation in methanol solution. These data further implied that the green-to-blue opsin shift may be achieved by (i) the presence of additional dipolar residues that solvate the PSB group, and (ii) stronger electrostatic interaction between the PSB group and its counterion and/or other polar groups. Therefore, this second criterion targeted nonpolar-to-dipolar changes of residues primarily on TM helices 2 and 7, and changes on TM helix 3 that could perturb the disposition of the Glu113 counterion. Third, the amino acid difference should involve a decrease in the molecular polarizability of residues lining the chromophore-binding pocket. An increase in solvent polarizability is generally associated with bathochromic spectral shifts (12Irving C.S. Byers G.W. Leermakers P.A. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Seven sites on TM helices 2, 6, and 7 were selected after the initial screening: Met86, Val87, Gly90, Trp265, Ala292, Ala295, and Ala299. Amino acids at positions 90, 265, and 292 had been mutated in earlier studies (39Rao V.R. Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Nature. 1994; 367: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 40Nakayama T.A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4269-4275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Fahmy K. Zvyaga T.A. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15065-15073Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and these residues were found to be located sufficiently close to the chromophore to affect the λmax of the mutant pigment. Furthermore, the role of residues at positions 87, 90, 265, 295, and 299 in spectral tuning is suggested by the fact these amino acids are conserved in the human, mouse, rat, and bovine blue cone sequences (42Chiu M.I. Zack D.J. Wang Y. Nathans J. Genomics. 1994; 21: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A glycine residue corresponding to position 83 in rhodopsin is also conserved in the blue cone sequences, but this site was not mutated because it had been shown in an earlier study that the D83G substitution does not alter the pigment λmax (43Nathans J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The seven residues in rhodopsin were replaced by the respective residues from the human blue cone sequence (Fig. 1). The mutant opsins were expressed in COS cells, regenerated with 11-cis-retinal, and purified. The genotypes and the spectral properties of the mutant pigments are listed in Table I. A polar hydroxy group was inserted at positions 90, 292, and 295 by replacing the original residue by a serine. The λmax values of the G90S and A292S mutants were blue-shifted by ∼400 cm−1, but the λmax of the A295S mutant was blue-shifted by only ∼200 cm−1. The λmax values for the G90S and A292S mutants are consistent with earlier studies in which a glutamic acid at either site caused a blue shift of ∼20 nm (39Rao V.R. Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Nature. 1994; 367: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 41Fahmy K. Zvyaga T.A. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15065-15073Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Val87and Ala299 were replaced by cysteine whose sulfhydryl group has a smaller dipole moment compared with a hydroxy group. The V87C or A299C substitution resulted in ∼80-cm−1 blue shift of the λmax. The replacement of Met86 with a leucine is also estimated to induce a shift of ∼80 cm−1. The λmax of the W265Y mutant was 485 nm, in agreement with earlier measurements (33Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11149-11159Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 40Nakayama T.A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4269-4275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This replacement induced the largest single opsin shift out of the initial set of substitutions examined.Table IAbsorption maxima and opsin shifts of rhodopsin mutantsMutationλmaxOpsin shiftnmcmHelix 2G90S489450V87C49880M86L/G90S(2)487530M86L/V87C/G90S(2′)489450Helix 3A117G496160E122L495200A124T497120A117G/E122L/A124T (3)489450P107R/T108H pH 4.549680 pH 65000 pH 8.549880P107R/T108H/A117G/E122L/A124T (3′) pH 6490410Helix 6W265Y485620Helix 7A292S491370A295S495200A299C49880A292S/A295S/A299C(7)484660Opsin shift from rhodopsin at respective pH. Open table in a new tab Opsin shift from rhodopsin at respective pH. The effects of multiple substitutions were examined by inserting two or more replacements within a single TM helix and constructing chimeras of these multiple-site mutants (Table I and II). Generally, the opsin shift due to multiple replacements within a TM helix was equal to the sum of the shifts of the single replacements. For example, the opsin shift of the A292S/A295S/A299C triple mutant was 660 (∼370 + 200 + 80) cm−1. The λmax of chimera2–7 containing the five mutations on TM helices 2 and 7 was 476 nm (Fig. 2), and its opsin shift of ∼1000 cm−1 is close to the expected additive shift of 1190 cm−1. Similarly, chimera 2–6-7 displayed a λmax of 460 nm, and the corresponding 1740-cm−1 shift is essentially equal to the sum of the shifts observed in the single-site TM helix 2, 6, and 7 mutant pigments.Table IIAbsorption maxima and opsin shifts of chimeric blue-shifted rhodopsin mutantsChimeraMutationλmaxOpsin shift measuredOpsin shift expectednmcm2–7M86L/G90S/A292S/A295S/A299C476100011902–3-7M86L/G90S/A117G/E122L/A124T47411001640 A292S/A295S/A299C2–6-7M86L/G90S/W265Y/A292S/A295S/A299C460174018102–3-6–7M86L/G90S/A117G/E122L/A124T43828302260 W265Y/A292S/A295S/A299C2–3′-6–7M86L/G90S/P107R/T108H/A117G/E122L43828302260 A124T/W265Y/A292S/A295S/A299C2′-3–6-7M86L/V87C/G90S/A117G/E122L43728802340 A124T/W265Y/A292S/A295S/A299CTotal shift expected if the opsin shifts induced by single-site mutations are additive.The chimera 2–3-6–7 is also referred to as blue-rho. Open table in a new tab Total shift expected if the opsin shifts induced by single-site mutations are additive. The chimera 2–3-6–7 is also referred to as blue-rho. The alignment of the blue cone amino acid sequences shows conservation of two basic residues near the extracellular border of TM helix 3 (28Yoshizawa T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 42Chiu M.I. Zack D.J. Wang Y. Nathans J. Genomics. 1994; 21: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and conservation of three residues (Gly, Leu, and Thr) in the TM portion. The corresponding residues in rhodopsin TM helix 3 are Thr107 and Pro108 near the extracellular border, and Ala117, Glu122, and Ala124 in the TM portion. Since most of these residues are likely to be located near the chromophore, mutant rhodopsins with substitutions at these positions were constructed (Table I). Individual replacement of Ala117, Glu122, and Ala124 by Gly, Leu, and Thr, respectively, caused 3–5-nm blue shifts of the λmax, corresponding to an opsin shift in the range of 120–200 cm−1. The λmax of the pigment with replacements at all three sites on TM helix 3 was at 489 nm, and the opsin shift in cm−1 was nearly equal to the sum of the individual shifts. Pro107 and Thr108 were replaced by Arg and His, respectively. The λmax of the double mutant at pH 6 is the same as that of native rhodopsin (Table I). It is blue-shifted by 4 and 2 nm at pH 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The opsin shifts relative to the λmax values of native rhodopsin at the pH values tested were less than 100 cm−1. Furthermore, the mutant pigment containing all five substitutions on TM helix 3 (positions 107, 108, 117, 122, and 124) showed the same λmax value as that of the TM helix 3 triple-site mutant (positions 117, 122, 124). Since Arg107 is probably protonated, these data suggest, at least for the case of His108, that there is no change in its protonation state that influences the electrostatic environment of the chromophore. Chimeras of the TM helix 3 triple-site mutant and the other TM helix mutants produced pigments with λmax values showing evidence of both negative and positive cooperative interactions between the substituted residues (Table II). The opsin shift of chimera 2–3-7 (λmax at 474 nm) is ∼540 cm−1 less than the magnitude expected from the sum of the shifts of TM helix 2, 3, and 7 mutants. By contrast, the blue-rho pigment (chimera 2–3-6–7) displayed a blue-shifted λmax at ∼438 nm, and the resultant opsin shift was ∼570 cm−1 greater than that expected from additive effects. The presence of the V87C substitution in TM helix 2 had no marked effect, and the λmax of chimera2′-3–6-7 was still measured at ∼437 nm (Table II). The inclusion of the P107R/T108H mutation in TM helix 3 also had no effect, and this pigment (chimera 2–3′-6–7) had the same λmax as the blue-rho pigment. Subsequent biophysical studies were performed on the blue-rho pigment. In order to determine the specific subset of substitutions responsible for this synergistic effect, the opsin shifts of various combinations of single-site replacements and TM helix mutants were examined (Table III). The combination of the W265Y mutation with the TM helix 3 mutations gave the expected additive shift, indicating that the positive cooperative effect requires one or more substitutions on TM helix 3 and all substitutions on TM helices 2, 6, and 7. The opsin shift data from the combination of single-site TM helix 3 mutants and chimera 2–6-7 show that the synergistic effect requires the E122L and A117G"

Transthyretin (TTR),1also known as thyroxin-binding prealbumin, is a plasma homotetrameric protein present in mammals, birds, and reptiles (2Richardson S.J. Bradley A.J. Wattenhall R.E.H. Hans P.J. Bobon J.J. Southwell B.R. Nicol S. Donnehan S.C. Screiber G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: 1359-1370PubMed Google Scholar). It is synthesized in the liver, choroid plexus of the cerebral ventricles, and retina (3Soprano D.R. Herbert J. Soprano K.J. Schon E.A. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11793-11798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein binds the complex retinol-retinol binding protein, preventing its glomerular filtration (4Monaco H.L. Rizzi M. Coda A. Science. 1995; 268: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), thyroxin and related compounds, and also polyhalogenated biphenyl compounds (5Lans M.C. Klasson-Weheler E. Wilemsen M. Meussen E. Safe S. Brower A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1993; 88: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The half-life of TTR is 2–3 days in humans (6Vahlquist A. Petersen P.A. Wibell L. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 3: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the major site of TTR degradation is the liver followed by the muscle and skin. TTR is associated with amyloid deposition in several organs in particular peripheral nerves, cardiac tissue, and ocular vitreous. The majority of the transthyretin-associated amyloidoses are due to single amino acid substitutions, and in senile systemic amyloidosis, the non-mutated protein is present in the amyloid fibrils (7Saraiva M.J.M. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 5: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy is characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, with the usual onset of clinical disease appearing about age 25–35. Peripheral and autonomic neuropathies are prominent and early features of the disease (8Andrade C. Brain. 1952; 75: 408-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain the amyloidogenic properties of TTR that lead to neurotoxicity and organ dysfunction (9Saraiva M.J.M. Costa P.P. Natvig J. Forre O. Husby G. Hesebekk A. Skogen B. Sletten K. Westmark P. Amyloid and Amyloidoses 1990. Kluver Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Germany1991: 569-574Google Scholar). It has been proposed that there is a conformational state, different from the one presented by the wild-type protein, prior to fibril formation (10Saraiva M.J. Almeida M.R. Alves I.L. Bonifácio M.J. Damas A.M. Palha J.A. Goldstein G. Lundgren E. CIBA Found. Symp. 1996; 199: 47-57PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, x-ray crystallographic comparison studies of the structures of the wild-type and amyloidogenic TTR variants will contribute to explain the amyloidogenic potential of TTR. Defining these structural differences is important, not only in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease, but also in devising therapeutic agents to combat the disease. Blake et al.

The exception is strand D, which is three residues in length. The eight strands form two sheets of four strands each, DAGH and CBEF, arranged in a topology similar to the classic greek key barrel. Two monomers are related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis, and they are joined along theFH border to form the dimer. The dimer is composed of two eight-stranded β-sheets,DAGHH′G′A′D′ andCBEFF′E′B′C′. The tetramer consists of two dimers related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis.

It was proposed that these changes could lead to the destabilization of the tetrameric structure, thus promoting the formation of an intermediate structure that polymerizes into amyloid fibrils. Preliminary results, concerning the crystallization procedure of the highly clinically aggressive mutant Leu55 → Pro TTR, were reported previously (17Sebastião P. Dauter Z. Saraiva M.J. Damas A.M.

Least squares refinement, using x-ray data with maximum resolution 2.7 Å, included the application of non-crystallographic and stereochemical restraints, to increase the data/parameter ratio. The stereochemical restraints were applied by using a library of stereochemical data, which contains a collection of target bond lengths and bond angles established by small molecule studies of 20 amino acids, high resolution studies of small peptide structures, and proteins. The non-crystallographic restraints were not used during the last stages of refinement, to evidence the differences between the eight monomers in the asymmetric unit. The Fourier syntheses were calculated using the CCP4 software package and were visualized using the graphics software package O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

The observed hydrogen-bonding pattern also indicates that the protein model obtained after refinement is correct. Fig. 1 shows the 3F obs − 2F calcelectron density map in the region of the Leu55→ Pro mutation. Comparison of the wild-type and Leu55 → Pro mutant TTR (Fig. 2) shows significant deviations between the Cα positions corresponding to the strandD (residues 54–56) and loop FG (residues 97–103). Minor deviations are also observed in α-helix and loopAB. In fact, in the mutant monomer, residues 54–56 belong to a long surface loop that connects strands C andE (according to the wild-type TTR nomenclature).

Leu55→ Pro TTR variant crystallizes nonisomorphously with wild-type TTR, unlike other amyloidogenic transthyretin variants, whose structures are described in the literature (13Hamilton J.A.

This non-crystallographic tetramer is formed through hydrogen bond interactions involving the AB loop and strandH, as observed for the wild-type TTR tetramer, although the length of the hydrogen bonds formed is longer (Table II), resulting in an overall less stable tetramer.Table IIHydrogen bonds (Å) involved in tetramer formationTTRLeu55 → Pro TTRAla19CO(A)…HNTyr114sym2.943.22Gly22CO(A)…HNVal122sym2.982.91Ala19CO(B)…HNTyr114sym2.923.18Gly22CO(B)…HNVal122sym2.853.06Ala19CO(C)…HNTyr114(F)3.49Gly22CO(C)…HNVal122(E)3.40Ala19CO(D)…HNTyr114(E)3.18Gly22CO(D)…HNVal122(F)3.00Ala19CO(E)…HNTyr114(D)3.06Gly22CO(E)…HNVal122(C)3.24Ala19CO(F)…HNTyr114(C)3.30Gly22CO(F)…HNVal122(D)2.97Ala19CO(G)…HNTyr114sym3.33Gly22CO(G)…HNVal122sym3.03Ala19CO(H)…HNTyr114sym3.05Gly22CO(H)…HNVal122sym3.00The eight monomers in the Leu55 → Pro TTR asymmetric unit cell are referred as A, B, C,D, E, F, G, andH. sym means the 2-fold crystallographic related dimer.

Impairment of dimer-dimer contacts, resulting in decreased tetramer stability, was reported previously from biochemical studies (23McCutchen S.L. Colón W. Kelly J.W.

A. 1996; 93: 6302-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the present work is unique in providing a detailed information about the interatomic contacts between the pathologic Leu55→ Pro TTR dimers, because this is the only amyloidogenic variant, reported until now, with a complete tetramer in the asymmetric unit. The packing interaction between the CE loops (residues 48–66) of neighboring monomers, belonging to different tetramers, forms the main crystal contact as illustrated in Fig. 3. Additionally, Arg21, from the AB loop of one monomer is H-bonded to the α-helix residue Gly83 of the neighboring monomer. Because of this interaction, the side chain of Arg21 is situated in good electron density, as shown in Fig. 3 D. In contrast, Arg21 is disordered in wild-type TTR, because of inefficient hydrogen bonding (13Hamilton J.A. Steinrauf L.K. Braden B.C. Liepnieks J. Benson M.D. Holmgren G. Sandgren O. Steen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2416-2424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In wild-type TTR, Arg21, from monomer A, forms a salt bridge to Asp18 (2.94 Å), a van der Waals interaction with Leu82 (4.77 Å), and a hydrogen bond to a water molecule with a high B-factor. In monomer B, Arg21 is modeled in a double conformation. The alternate position of the B21 side chain forms hydrogen bonds to SerB23 (2.64 Å) and to the hydroxyl group of TyrB78 (2.43 Å). In addition to loop CE ↔ loop CE, loopAB ↔ α-helix interactions, there are other interactions, namely Ser100 (loopFG) ↔ Arg103 (loop FG), Ser100 (loop FG) ↔ Asn124 (C terminus). These interactions are not observed in the wild-type TTR. Therefore, they are referred as abnormal intersubunit contacts, to distinguish them from the intersubunit contacts that are also observed in wild-type TTR, which are designated as native. The surface areas involved in the monomer-monomer and dimer-dimer interactions were calculated for the Leu55 → Pro and wild-type TTR (Table III). Whereas the intersubunit contacts between two monomers in a dimer do not differ between the variant and wild-type structures, the tetramer dimer-dimer interface diminishes in Leu55 → Pro TTR. It is also evident that there is a tight monomer-monomer interaction and a much more tenuous dimer-dimer interface. This fact is experimentally confirmed by the observation that TTR dissociates to form 30-kDa dimers in SDS and 15-kDa monomers only after boiling in SDS with reducing agents (25Kelly J.W. Lansbury P.T. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1994; 1: 186-205Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the interface between dimers of different tetramers (2524 Å2) is higher than the area of contact between the dimers in a tetramer (1559 and 1837 Å2, for the variant and wild-type protein, respectively).Table IIISurface areas (Å2) involved in the intersubunit contacts for Leu → Pro and wild-type TTRLeu55 → Pro TTRTTRMonomer surface area64056432Dimer surface area1097711093Native monomer-monomer interface916886Abnormal monomer-monomer interface1653Native dimer-dimer interface15591837Abnormal dimer-dimer interface2524The calculated interface areas correspond to the calculated values per subunit, i.e. monomer-monomer interface area per monomer, dimer-dimer interface per dimer.Native intersubunit contacts are referred to those present in the soluble TTR tetramer.Abnormal intersubunit contacts are referred to those observed in the Leu55 → Pro TTR crystal structure, but not the wild-type TTR.

However, the mechanism that converts normally soluble TTR tetramers into insoluble amyloid fibrils remains largely unknown. Structural comparative studies of the native fold and abnormal conformations of TTR variants are expected to be very useful in developing therapeutic strategies for intervention in amyloid disease. In particular, the molecular characterization of the most aggressive TTR amyloidogenic variant, Leu55 → Pro TTR, may provide an important contribution to the characterization of the amyloidogenic process. Studies concerning the kinetics of amyloid formation indicate that the Leu55 → Pro TTR variant exists in an amyloidogenic conformation at conditions, whereas the wild-type protein remains stable and non-amyloidogenic. It was observed that amyloid formation from the wild-type protein had an initial rate determining step, not diminished in the presence of pre-formed fibrils, which could be associated with the conformational change of the protein into an amyloidogenic intermediate. However, the kinetics of amyloid formation from the Leu55 → Pro TTR variant showed the absence of this lag time (26Bonifácio M.J. Sakaki Y. Saraiva M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 131: 35-42Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This could suggest that Leu55 → Pro TTR is already in an amyloidogenic conformation, which assembles immediately into amyloid fibrils, under the conditions tested. Furthermore, TTR with a triple deletion on strand D forms amyloid fibrils in vitro at neutral conditions (27Goldsteins G. Andersson K. Olofsson A. Dacklin I. Edvinsson A. Baranov V. Sandgren O. Thylén C. Hammarström S. Lundgren E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5346-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The evidence for an amyloidogenic conformation for Leu55→ Pro TTR is further corroborated by the experimental study of the acid denaturation pathway of some TTR variants, namely Thr119 → Met, Val30 → Met, and Leu55 → Pro. It was observed that the amyloidogenicity of the variants was inversely correlated with the stability of the tetramer toward acid denaturation (26Bonifácio M.J. Sakaki Y. Saraiva M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 131: 35-42Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that the Leu55 → Pro TTR variant exists in an amyloidogenic conformation, with an increased tendency to self-association into amyloid fibrils, even at conditions where the wild-type protein remains stable. It is likely that the crystal structure here described for the Leu55 → Pro TTR monomer resembles the amyloidogenic intermediate in the biochemical pathway that leads to the amyloid fibril deposition. The data reported here indicate that the Leu55 → Pro mutation changes the transthyretin secondary structure by the disruption of strand D: residues 54–56 belong to a long loop that connects β-strands C and E, according to the wild-type TTR nomenclature. This loop is involved in the crystallographic packing observed in the present crystal structure (Fig. 3, A and B). Positional differences are also detected along the monomer-monomer and dimer-dimer interfaces. The hydrogen bonds between the ABloop of one dimer to the strand H of the other dimer (native dimer-dimer interface) are clearly longer than those described for the wild-type TTR tetramer, indicating a potentially less stable Leu55 → Pro tetramer (Table II). This result was already pointed out for the amyloidogenic Val122 → Ile TTR variant (15Damas A.M. Ribeiro S. Palha J.A. Saraiva M.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and it is in agreement with biochemical studies concerning the tetramer stability of several TTR variants (23McCutchen S.L. Colón W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12119-12127Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 34). The surface areas associated with the native dimer-dimer interface,i.e. loop AB ↔ strand Hinteraction, which are also an indication of the tetramer stability, are 14.2 and 16.5% of the total dimer surface area for Leu55 → Pro TTR and wild-type TTR, respectively. In addition to the native dimer-dimer intermolecular interactions, which are common to Leu55 → Pro and wild-type TTR, there are other interactions between neighboring Leu55 → Pro TTR dimers. These include the loop CE ↔ loopCE, loop AB ↔ α-helix, loopFG ↔ loop FG. The corresponding area is 23% of the Leu55 → Pro TTR dimer total surface area (Table III). This indicates that the abnormal dimer-dimer interface is considerably more extensive than the native dimer-dimer interface, and therefore it may provide the driving force for TTR polymerization into amyloid fibrils. Fig. 3 A shows the arrangement of the Leu55 → Pro TTR molecules in the unit cell, with the asymmetric units, composed of eight monomers, colored differently. The overall force in the assembly of the units is the intermolecular interaction between theCE loops (residues 48–66) from the different units (Fig. 3,A and B) and the hydrogen bonding between theAB loop and the α-helix of the nearest neighbor (Fig. 3,C and D). The FG loop (residues 97–103), which differs in all amyloidogenic variants and which is the same in wild-type and non-amyloidogenic TTRs, is also involved in the Leu55 → Pro TTR monomer interactions. Ser100, from one monomer, forms hydrogen bonds with Arg103 or Asn124 from a neighboring monomer (Table IV). These intermolecular interactions between neighboring Leu55 → Pro TTR monomers may be important for the self-association of TTR. The crystal packing presented in Fig. 3 A clearly shows several channels running parallel to each other, thus suggesting a tubular structure that might be similar to the TTR amyloid fibril structure. The protein structure, around each channel, which can be considered as an intermediate structure for TTR amyloid fibril, is composed of four monomers per cross-section. The inner and outer diameters of this structure are 30 and 100 Å, respectively, and its wall is constituted by eight monomers. Four monomers are at one level, and the other four are at a level half way below or above a pseudo-unit cell, with dimension a = 84 Å, along the fibril direction (Fig. 4). The hydrogen bonding direction of the β-pleated sheets is about 45° to the proposed fibril direction. In the usual cross-β structure, reported for amyloid fibrils, the hydrogen bonding direction is parallel to the fibril axis. However, it is possible that when fibrils are assembled, and assuming that the tetrameric structure was disrupted, the movement between units is not so much restricted, and they may rotate relatively to the fibril axis approaching the situation of the cross-β structure. This model agrees with the results from electron micrographs image reconstruction, which showed that TTR amyloid fibrils have a cross-section with four protofilaments arranged around a central hollow core (28Serpell L.C. Sand M. Fraser P.E. Luther P.K. Morris E.P. Sundgren O. Lundgren E. Blake C.C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We have now presented information about the contacts between the units in the model, which is important because it provides insight into the development of strategies to inhibit the pathogenic process. Additionally, the reported diameter dimension of the amyloid fibril is similar to the diameter of the tubular structure proposed in this work. Saraiva et al. (10Saraiva M.J. Almeida M.R. Alves I.L. Bonifácio M.J. Damas A.M. Palha J.A. Goldstein G. Lundgren E. CIBA Found. Symp. 1996; 199: 47-57PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the region corresponding to the strand D in Leu55 → Pro TTR is exposed, according to monoclonal antibodies binding studies. It is interesting to note that in the Leu55 → Pro TTR crystal structure, this region forms the outer part of the asymmetric units that assemble into the tubular structure in the unit cell (Fig. 3, A and B). We believe that the model presented here, which derives from the analysis of the crystal structure of Leu55 → Pro TTR variant, is a good approach to the molecular interactions present in TTR amyloid fibrils. The crystallographic packing analysis indicates putative interactions between units in the TTR amyloid (Table IV, Figs. 3 and 4). In particular, residues Arg21, Gly83, His56, Glu62, Ser100, Arg103, and Asn124 play an important role in Leu55 → Pro TTR intersubunit interface and may be involved in amyloid fibril quaternary interactions. Site-directed mutagenesis studies, together with amyloid fibril formation in vitro of the constructed mutants, are under way to reinforce and pave the way to the development of therapeutic agents that avoid the adoption of an amyloidogenic conformation."

To solve this problem, as described below, we took advantage of a protein encoded in Saccharomyces cerevisiae which has been shown to be a DIC (15Palmieri L. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E.

In all species that have been investigated, the sequences of family members are made of three related domains repeated in tandem about 100 amino acid in length, each probably being folded into two antiparallel transmembrane α-helices linked by an extensive hydrophilic sequence. The three repeats are joined together by shorter hydrophilic sequences. The repeats in the various family members are all related to each other, and several characteristic sequence features are conserved (17Walker J.E. Runswick M.J. J. Bioenerg.

Comparisons of sequences of members of the family of known biochemical function in yeast with those of their mammalian counterparts show that the homologous pairs are too distant for the yeast sequences (protein or DNA) to provide a feasible basis for cloning the mammalian proteins. Therefore, the sequence of the S. cerevisiae DIC has been compared with the proteins encoded in the available genomic sequences of Caenorhabditis elegans. Currently, it encodes 32 members of the mitochondrial transporter family, and the two most closely related proteins (named K11G12.5 and B0432.4) were identical to the yeast DIC in 37% and 30% of their residues, respectively. The K11G12.5 protein has been expressed in Escherichia coli, reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles, and demonstrated to be a DIC. Then the sequence of the C. elegans DIC was compared with protein sequences encoded in mammalian expressed sequence tags. In this way, two partial murine expressed sequence tags (AA199557 and AA041737) were found to encode a fragment of a closely related protein, and synthetic oligonucleotides based on their sequences were used to amplify a DNA segment from rat liver cDNA. Using this segment, the complete rat cDNA was then obtained by PCR experiments. The encoded protein was shown to have transport specificity and other biochemical characteristics that were identical to those of the DIC isolated from rat liver mitochondria. Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction endonucleases were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals. Amersham Italy S.r.l. (Milan, Italy) supplied l-[1,4(2, 3)-14C]malic acid and [33P]. Cardiolipin and sarkosyl (N-lauroylsarcosine) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (Milan, Italy). All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Adaptor primers AP1, AP2, and CDS were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Oligonucleotides were made with a DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 320B). Some of them had additional 5′-linkers and were employed as primers in PCRs. Others were used as hybridization probes for the reaction products, as described before (21Dolce V. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10451-10460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some unique 17-base oligonucleotides were used as sequencing primers. An automatic DNA sequenator (Applied Biosystems, Prism 377) was employed with dye terminator kits (Perkin-Elmer). Sequence errors from PCRs were avoided by sequencing at least three independent clones in both directions from each reaction. Ambiguities were resolved by sequencing more clones. Data bases were compiled and analyzed with the program Autoassembler (Perkin-Elmer). Touchdown PCRs (22Don R.H. Cox P.T. Wainwright B.J. Baker K. Mattick J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar) were conducted in a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer model 480). The reaction mixtures (70 μl) contained adaptor-ligated double-stranded rat liver cDNA (1 ng, CLONTECH) with primers (final concentration 0.5 μm). After an initial incubation at 94 °C for 2 min without Taq polymerase, the PCR cycle was denaturation at 94 °C (30 s) and annealing at 72 °C (4 min). These steps were repeated 5 times. Then the cycle was repeated for 5 and 20 times with both annealing and extension temperatures at 70 °C or 68 °C, respectively. The entire procedure was repeated once again with each of the previous final PCR mixtures (1 μl) as template, with two nested primers (final concentration 1 μm), and 2 units of Taq polymerase. The cDNA sequence was extended to the 5′-end with primers AP1 and AP2 (modified by substituting theNotI restriction site by EcoRI) and to the 3′-end with the primer CDS. The products were identified and recovered from agarose gels as described before (21Dolce V. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10451-10460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EcoRI and BamHI sites in the linkers were digested, and the products were cloned into the pUC19 vector. Full-length cDNAs for the rat and C. elegans DIC were amplified by 60 or 30 cycles of PCR, respectively, as described before (21Dolce V. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10451-10460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the annealing temperature was 60 °C. The templates were rat liver cDNA (CLONTECH) and for C. elegans, phage DNA (1 ng) from clone cm15f11 (23Runswick M.J. Philippides A. Lauria G. Walker J.E. DNA Sequence. 1994; 4: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The forward and reverse primers were nucleotides 34–55 and 869–894 of the rat cDNA (see Fig. 2), with 5′-NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively, and nucleotides 15–38 and 863–886 of clone cm15f11, with additional 5′-NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. The amplified products, 0.9 kb in length, were purified (with Qiaquick from Qiagen), cloned into the pMW7 expression vector, and the constructs were transformed into E. coliDH5α cells. Transformants selected on 2xTY plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) were screened by direct colony PCR and by restriction digestion of purified plasmids. The sequences of inserts were verified. The rat and C. elegans DICs were overexpressed at 37 °C in E. coli CO214(DE3), a mutant of E. coli C41(DE3) selected for its ability to overexpress the mitochondrial phosphate carrier without toxicity, 2G. Fiermonte and J. E. Walker, unpublished work. as described before for improvement of host strains (24Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). Control cultures with the empty vector were processed in parallel. Inclusion bodies were purified according to Fiermonte et al. (25Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The pellets were washed twice with buffer containing 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, Triton X-114 (3%, w/v), and 1 mm EDTA and then once with TE buffer. Then the proteins were solubilized in a solution of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, sarkosyl (1.8%, w/v), and 0.1 mm EDTA. A small insoluble residue was removed by centrifugation at 258,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples taken at various points of growth of bacterial cultures and purified inclusion bodies were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 17.5% gels (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue dye or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, stained with Coomassie Blue dye, and their NH2termini sequenced (Applied Biosystems, model 477A). The yield of purified protein was estimated by laser densitometry (LKB 2202 Ultroscan) of SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue dye, with carbonic anhydrase as standard. Sarkosyl-soluble proteins were diluted 10-fold with a buffer containing 2 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 0.6% (w/v) Triton X-114, and 0.2 mm EDTA and reconstituted into liposomes in the presence of appropriate substrates, as described before (25Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), except that the reconstitution mixture contained cardiolipin (1 mg/ml). The extent of incorporation of the protein into liposomes was estimated as follows. The proteoliposomes were passed through a Sephadex G-75 column, centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 30 min, precipitated with cold acetone, and delipidated with organic solvents (27Capobianco L. Bisaccia F. Mazzeo M. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8974-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The protein was dissolved in 0.1% SDS, and after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the amount of the DIC was measured by laser densitometry of stained samples, as described above. External substrates were removed from proteoliposomes on Sephadex G-75 (28Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Transport at 25 °C was started by adding [14C]malate or 33P to the eluted proteoliposomes and, unless otherwise indicated, terminated after 20 s (C. elegans DIC) or 40 s (rat DIC) by the addition of either 30 mm butylmalonate or a mixture containing 30 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and 10 mm bathophenanthroline, (this is the “inhibitor-stop” method (28Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)). In controls, the inhibitor was added with the labeled substrate. Extraliposomal labeled substrate was removed from quenched samples on Dowex AG1-X8, and eluted radioactivity was measured (28Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Transport activities were calculated from the experimental values minus the controls. Various other transport activities were also assayed by the inhibitor-stop method. Total RNA was extracted from rat liver, kidney, heart, and brain according to Chirgwin et al. (29Chirgwin J.M. Przbyla A.F. MacDonald A.J . Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16648) Google Scholar). The hybridization experiments were performed as described before (30Dolce V. Fiermonte G. Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), except that the probe was nucleotides 34–894 of the rat cDNA sequence (see Fig. 2). Samples were autoradiographed at −70 °C for 15 days with an intensifying screen. Hybridization signals were normalized with an 850-base pair probe encoding part of rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (31Ness G.C. Pendleton L.C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 21-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) employed under the same conditions as described above. Samples (10 μg) of rat liver genomic DNA (32Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar) were digested for 6 h at 37 °C with one of the restriction enzymesNcoI, EcoRI, or BamHI. DNA fragments were separated on 0.8% agarose gels, transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (33Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21439) Google Scholar), and hybridized with a probe from the cDNA for the rat DIC (nucleotides 91–536; see Fig. 2) using the same procedures described for Northern blotting. Homologs of the yeast DIC in C. elegans were identified by screening the nematode (the Sanger Center, Hinxton, U. K.) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information data bases with the sequence of the S. cerevisiae protein (15Palmieri L. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) using the BLASTP program. The EMBL nonredundant expressed sequence tag data base was probed with a protein sequence encoded in the nematode clone K11G12.5 using the TBLASTN program. The same program was used to search all available sequence data bases for murine fragments coding for protein sequences related to the putative rat DIC protein sequence. Amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW (version 1.7). The nematode gene product K11G12.5 is identical to the yeast DIC sequence (15Palmieri L. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Kakhniashvili D. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Xu Y. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4516-4521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and to the bovine oxoglutarate-malate carrier proteins (34Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Bisaccia F. lacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11033-11040Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) in 37 and 35% of its residues, respectively. However, the bovine oxoglutarate-malate carrier protein is 64% identical to the C. elegans protein B0432.4, which is therefore more likely to be the worm oxoglutarate-malate carrier protein than K11G12.5. Two overlapping cDNA clones (AA199557 and AA041737) from Mus musculus contain 622 nucleotides of unique sequence, and the encoded protein sequence is 47% identical to part of the C. elegans K11G12.5 protein. Four nested oligonucleotides (1F, 2F, 1R, 2R) based on the sequence of theAA199557 and AA041737 cDNA sequences from M. musculuswere used to amplify a segment from a rat liver cDNA (see PCR1 in Figs. 1 and 2). The product gave a single band of about 350 base pairs. Its nucleotide sequence is 94% identical to theM. musculus partial sequence. The rat cDNA sequence was completed by experiments PCR2 and PCR3 (see Fig. 1). The final rat cDNA sequence of 1946 nucleotides (see Fig. 2) encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 31,455. The assignment of the proposed start codon is supported by the closely related murine sequence where the corresponding codon is preceded by an in-frame stop codon. The fragment of murine protein sequence (132 amino acids) is 96% identical to the corresponding part of the rat sequence. The 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions are 33 and 1055 base pairs, respectively, and the sequence is terminated by a run of A residues separated by a 13-nucleotide sequence from the preceding AATAAA sequence, a typical signal for polyadenylation of mRNA (32Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar). Recent additions to sequence data bases have allowed us to assemble the entire coding sequence of the murine protein. In the alignment of the four homologous protein sequences (Fig. 3), the putative rat DIC is 96, 59, and 37% identical to the murine, C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae proteins, respectively. The overexpression of the C. elegans K11G12.5 protein and its rat homolog in E. coli C0214(DE3) (see Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6) yielded about 60 and 45 mg of purified protein per liter of culture, respectively. Both purified proteins gave single bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8) with apparent molecular masses of 32 and 29.5 kDa, respectively (the corresponding calculated molecular masses including the initiator methionine are 32.23 and 31.55). Neither protein was detected in bacteria harvested immediately before induction of expression (lanes 1–3) nor in cells harvested after induction but lacking the coding sequence in the expression vector (lane 4). The determined NH2-terminal sequences (AEDKTKRLGR and AEARTSRWYF, respectively) of residues 1–10 of the purified 32- and 29.5-Da proteins are identical to those predicted for residues 2–11 of the C. elegans K11G12.5 protein and its rat homolog, respectively. The proportion of rat and C. elegans proteins incorporated into liposomes in various experiments was usually in the range of 11–18% of the protein used in the experiment, and they were incorporated to approximately the same extent. Both proteins catalyzed a [14C]malate/phosphate exchange that was inhibited by butylmalonate (see Table I), as does the DIC in rat mitochondria (1Chappel J.B. Haarhoff K.N. Kaniuga Z. Slater E.C.

No such activity was found by reconstitution of sarkosyl-solubilized material from bacterial cells either lacking the expression vector, or harvested immediately before induction of overexpression. Neither reconstituted protein catalyzed the homoexchange of pyruvate, citrate, oxoglutarate, glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, carnitine, ornithine, ADP or ATP, all being substrates for various mitochondrial transporters.Table IDependence on internal substrate of the transport properties of proteoliposomes containing bacterially expressed C. elegans K11G12.5 protein or its rat homologInternalC. elegansK11G12.5Rat homolog[14C]Malate33P[14C]Malate33Pmmol/min/g proteinNone (Cl−present)1.52.40.90.5Malate66.478.017.820.4Phosphate85.293.218.724.9Malonate65.676.416.718.6Succinate53.557.114.513.3Sulfate51.453.413.312.1Thiosulfate50.145.111.612.6Oxoglutarate3.74.11.00.9Fumarate1.60.81.40.2Aspartate1.12.71.40.5Glutamate0.72.30.30.6Citrate0.83.50.40.5ATP1.53.21.20.8Pyruvate0.91.50.40.5Carnitine1.11.90.60.4Ornithine1.82.10.80.5Proteoliposomes reconstituted with the C. elegans K11G12.5 protein or its rat homolog were preloaded internally with various substrates (concentration 20 mm).

Open table in a new tab Proteoliposomes reconstituted with the C. elegans K11G12.5 protein or its rat homolog were preloaded internally with various substrates (concentration 20 mm).

Transport was measured over 20 s or 40 s in proteoliposomes reconstituted with the C. elegans or rat protein, respectively. Similar results were obtained in four different experiments. Values shown are mmol of substrate transported/min/g of protein. The substrate specificity of the C. elegans and rat recombinant proteins was examined in greater detail by measuring the uptake of [14C]malate and 33P into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with a variety of substrates (Table I). In the absence of internal substrate, uptake of labeled malate or phosphate was not observed. The highest activities were detected in the presence of internal l-malate, phosphate, and malonate. To a somewhat lower extent, succinate, sulfate, and thiosulfate were exchanged for both external malate and phosphate. Virtually no exchange was observed with internal oxoglutarate, fumarate, glutamate, aspartate, citrate, ATP, pyruvate, carnitine, or ornithine. The residual activity in the presence of these substrates was approximately the same as the activity observed in the presence of sodium chloride. Therefore, proteoliposomes reconstituted with the C. elegans and rat recombinant proteins import external malate and phosphate only in exchange for certain dicarboxylates, inorganic sulfur-containing anions, and phosphate, similar to the rat DIC in liver mitochondria (1Chappel J.B.

The [14C]malate/phosphate exchange reaction of both proteins was inhibited by the substrate analogs butylmalonate, benzylmalonate, and phenylsuccinate (Table II). Butylmalonate was more effective than phenylsuccinate, as with the DIC in mitochondria (3Crompton M. Palmieri F. Capano M. Quagliariello E. Biochem.

In contrast to the recombinant C. elegans protein, the rat protein is more sensitive to organic mercurials and is also inhibited by 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide to some extent.

Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but this point requires further clarification. There are at least two possible explanations for this partial inhibition of the rat recombinant protein by N-ethylmaleimide. First, the expressed rat protein might differ from the native DIC by the absence of disulfide bridges (although there is no evidence for their presence in the native rat protein). Second, both rat liver mitochondria and the DIC purified from mitochondria might contain more than one isoform of DIC, one being relatively insensitive toN-ethylmaleimide. The ability of nonradioactive potential substrates to inhibit the reconstituted [14C]malate/phosphate exchange of both theC. elegans and rat recombinant proteins was also examined. The exchange was prevented by external addition of any one of the known substrates of the DIC (Table I), and it was unaffected by substrates of other mitochondrial carriers, such as fumarate, oxoglutarate, ADP, or citrate. The dependence of the [14C]malate/malate and33P/malate exchange rates on substrate concentration was investigated by changing the concentration of externally added [14C]malate or 33P at a constant internal concentration of 10 mm malate (see Fig. 5). In liposomes reconstituted with either the C. elegans or the rat protein (Fig. 5,A and B) linear functions were obtained which intersected the ordinate close to a common point. The different slopes indicate that the half-saturation constant (K m) for phosphate is about three times higher than for malate (in liposomes reconstituted with the C. elegans protein, the mean values from four experiments are 0.54 ± 0.10 and 1.52 ± 0.36 mm for malate and phosphate, respectively; for the rat protein the corresponding values are 0.78 ± 0.14 and 1.77 ± 0.27). Thus, both the C. elegans and rat recombinant proteins are also similar in these respects to the rat liver DIC (K m values for malate and phosphate are 0.26 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively, in mitochondria (2Palmieri F. Prezioso G. Quagliariello E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 22: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and 0.49 mm and 1.41 mm, respectively, after purification (11Indiveri C. Capobianco L. Krämer R. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). The K m values of the recombinant yeast DIC for malate and phosphate are 0.59 and 1.65 mm, respectively (15Palmieri L. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In four experiments, theV max value, corrected for small differences in efficiency of reconstitution, was 149.3 ± 38.6 mmol/min/g of C. elegans protein and 44.7 ± 12.7 mmol/min/g of rat protein. These values are virtually the same for both the malate/malate and phosphate/malate exchanges and are independent of the type of substrate, as observed before (2Palmieri F. Prezioso G. Quagliariello E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 22: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 11Indiveri C. Capobianco L. Krämer R. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys.

Furthermore, theV max values of the recombinant rat and C. elegans proteins are higher than those determined previously for the purified rat liver and recombinant yeast DIC (11Indiveri C. Capobianco L. Krämer R. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Palmieri L. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This difference may arise because the efficiency of reconstitution was not quantified in the earlier studies. The sequences of the DICs consist of three homologous tandem repeats that are distantly related in sequence to repeats in other mitochondrial carrier proteins. Each repetitive element appears to be made of two antiparallel transmembrane hydrophobic α-helices linked by an extensive polar region. Therefore, they have the tripartite structure that is characteristic of other mitochondrial transporters (17Walker J.E. Runswick M.J. J. Bioenerg.

FEBS Lett. 1982; 144: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Each of the three domains contains the sequence motif characteristic of the mitochondrial carriers, namely P-h-D/E-X-h-K/R-X-R/K-(20–30 residues)-D/E-G-(4 residues)-a-K/R-G (where h and a represent hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids, respectively, and X is unknown). Some mitochondrial carriers are unique proteins encoded by single genes, whereas others have closely related isoforms either encoded by multiple genes (39Walker J.E. Cozens A.L. Dyer M.R.

Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10451-10460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because only single hybridizing bands were detected by Southern hybridization (see Fig. 6), it seems likely that the rat DIC has a single gene, although this experiment would not detect isoforms arising by alternative splicing or isoforms with distantly related coding sequences. Among the tissues that were examined, the rat DIC was expressed most strongly in liver. Somewhat lower levels were detected in brain, and much less was found in heart (see Fig. 7). It is notable that the DIC transcript, estimated to be about 2.1 kb, is larger than the cDNA sequence that has been determined, indicating that the transcript may have an extensive 5′-noncoding region. High levels of mRNA for the DIC in liver and kidney (not shown) are probably related to gluconeogenesis and ureogenesis, which occur mainly in these tissues. At present, there is no explanation for the relatively high levels of the DIC mRNA in brain and for its presence in heart where gluconeogenesis and ureogenesis do not operate. So the DIC may have other functions in these tissues, possibly exclusively catalyzing the supply of substrates to the Krebs cycle. It remains to be demonstrated that the DIC mRNA is translated in heart and brain."

We recently isolated cDNAs encoding human and mouse tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase-1 (Ouyang, Y. B., Lane, W. S., and Moore, K. L. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 2896–2901). Here we report the isolation of cDNAs encoding a second tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST), designated TPST-2. The human and mouse TPST-2 cDNAs predict type II transmembrane proteins of 377 and 376 amino acid residues, respectively. The cDNAs encode functionalN-glycosylated enzymes when expressed in mammalian cells. In addition, preliminary analysis indicates that TPST-1 and TPST-2 have distinct specificities toward peptide substrates. The human TPST-2 gene is on chromosome 22q12.1, and the mouse gene is in the central region of chromosome 5. We have also identified a cDNA that encodes a TPST in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that maps to the right arm of chromosome III. Thus, we have identified two new members of a class of membrane-bound sulfotransferases that catalyze tyrosineO-sulfation.

However, a functional role for tyrosine O-sulfation has not been established for the majority of the proteins known to have this modification.

We recently purified a TPST from rat liver microsomes and cloned human and mouse cDNAs that encode this enzyme activity, which we now designate TPST-1 (24Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The human and mouse TPST-1 cDNAs encode N-glycosylated proteins of 370 amino acids with type II transmembrane topology and are broadly expressed in mammalian tissues as assessed by Northern blotting. In this paper we report the molecular cloning and expression of human and mouse cDNAs encoding a second mammalian TPST, designated TPST-2, and a TPST from the nematode Caenorhabditi elegans, designated TPST-A. TPST activity was determined by measuring the transfer of [35S]sulfate from [35S]PAPS (NEN Life Science Products) to immobilized peptide substrates, as described previously (24Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized by Biosynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX) and were linked (2.1–3.0 μmol/ml resin) via a COOH-terminal cysteine residue to iodoacetamide-activated resin (UltraLink™ Iodoacetyl, Pierce). All assays were performed in duplicate. One unit of activity was defined as 1 pmol of product formed per minute. The pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was modified for expression of full-length TPST fusion proteins containing an NH2-terminal epitope for HPC4, a Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody to protein C, as described previously (24Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Full-length human and mouse TPST-2 coding sequences were amplified by Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) using EST clones 810937 and 569461 as templates, respectively. The primers used were: top strand, 5′-CGGGATCCGCGCCTGTCGGTGCGTA-3′, and bottom strand, 5′-GGAATTCTGGAAATCACGAGCTTCC-3′. The cycling parameters were 25 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The polymerase chain reaction introduced a BamHI site in place of the native initiation codon and an EcoRI site after the termination codon. The products were gel purified, ligated into pGEM-T (Promega), and sequenced on both strands. The inserts were excised usingBamHI and EcoRI and directionally cloned into unique BamHI and EcoRI sites in the multiple cloning site of the modified pcDNA3.1(+) vector. In the fusion proteins the native initiating methionine is replaced with 15 residues containing the HPC4 epitope (MEDQVDPRLIDGKDP). The pcDNA3.1(+) vector was also modified for expression of soluble fusion proteins. The HindIII and BamHI fragment in the multiple cloning site of the vector was replaced with a 103-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA) with a 5′ HindIII half-site and a 3′BamHI half-site containing an ideal Kozak sequence followed by the nucleotide sequence encoding the transferrin signal peptide and the HPC4 epitope. cDNAs encoding soluble forms of human and mouse TPST-2 were amplified by Taq polymerase using the full-length cDNAs as templates. The primers used for amplification of soluble TPST-2 were: top strand for human TPST-2, 5′-CGGGATCCAGGACAGCAGGTGCTAGAG-3′; top strand for mouse TPST-2, 5′-CGGGATCCAGGGCAGCAAGTACTGGAG-3′, and bottom strand for human and mouse TPST-2, 5′-GGAATTCTGGAAATCACGAGCTTCC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction introduced a BamHI site at the 5′ end and anEcoRI site after the termination codon. The cycling parameters were 25 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. After the polymerase chain reaction both products were gel purified, digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into unique BamHI and EcoRI sites in the multiple cloning site. In the fusion proteins the native NH2-terminal 24 amino acids of TPST-2, including the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain, were replaced with the transferrin signal peptide (MRLAVGALLVCAVLGLCLA) followed by the 12-residue HPC4 epitope. Thus, the NH2 terminus of both recombinant soluble enzymes is NH2-EDQVDPRLIDGKDPG25Q (HPC4 epitope is underlined) after signal peptide cleavage. The predicted molecular masses of soluble human and mouse TPST-2 fusion proteins are 40,940 and 41,152 Da, respectively. The human embryonic kidney cell line 293-T was grown in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C and 5% CO2/95% air. Cells were transfected with empty vector or vector containing cDNAs encoding TPST fusion proteins using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells extracts and conditioned medium were processed as described previously and stored at −80°C (24Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A peptide corresponding to residues 360–376 (CGYFQVNQVSTSPHLGSS) of mouse TPST-2 was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 431 peptide synthesizer (Tom Zamborelli, Amgen). The peptide was coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin through the added NH2-terminal cysteine (underlined) and injected into New Zealand White rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. Reamstown, PA). Immune sera were collected and tested by Western analysis of extracts of 293-T cells transfected with mouse and human TPST-1 and TPST-2 cDNAs. The antiserum recognized two closely spaced polypeptides of ≈47 kDa in extracts of cells overexpressing full-length mouse and human TPST-2 but not in cells overexpressing mouse or human TPST-1. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences for human and mouse TPST-1 were used to perform reiterative searches of the EST data base using the TBLASTN and BLASTN algorithms. Excluding ESTs that aligned with TPST-1, 17 human and 23 mouse ESTs were identified that were aligned into separate contigs. The human and mouse TPST-2 contigs spanned open reading frames 1131 and 1128 nucleotides in length, respectively. I.M.A.G.E. Consortium cDNA clones (25Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL), and the nucleotide sequences of both strands were determined. Mouse TPST-2 EST clone 569461 (GenBankTM accession numberAA369474) had a 1760-bp insert containing a 156-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region (UTR), a 1128-nucleotide coding region, and a 476-nucleotide 3′-UTR. Human TPST-2 EST clone 810937 (GenBankTM accession number AA459614) had a 1854-bp insert. Alignment of the nucleotide sequences of human EST clone 810937 and mouse EST clone 569461 showed that the open reading frames were 89% identical. However, the alignment indicated that the human clone had a frameshift mutation due to the deletion of a guanosine at nucleotide 1200 that would result in premature termination of translation. This conclusion is supported by the following observations. An independent human TPST-2 EST clone (clone 307478, GenBankTM accession number W21315) was sequenced, and the published sequences of two additional ESTs that align to this region were compared (GenBankTM accession numbers H94110 and AA374022). All three ESTs did not have the frameshift mutation. In addition, a BAC clone (445C9, GenBankTM accession number Z95115) that contains the complete genomic sequence of the human TPST-2 gene (see below) also lacked the frameshift mutation. To construct a full-length human TPST-2 cDNA, the 1087-nucleotide 5′ end of the EST clone 810937 and the 768-nucleotide 3′ end of the EST clone 307478 were spliced together by blunt end ligation at a unique Eco47III restriction site. Therefore, the full-length human TPST-2 cDNA is 1855-bp in length and contains a 197-nucleotide 5′-UTR, a 1131-nucleotide coding region, and a 527-nucleotide 3′-UTR. The sequences surrounding the proposed initiating ATG codons have a purine in position −3 and a cytosine in position +4, thereby conforming to Kozak consensus features (26Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). Both cDNAs have a single polyadenylation signal upstream from the beginning of the poly(A) tail. The human and mouse cDNAs encode proteins of 377 and 376 amino acids with molecular masses of 41,909 Da for the human and 42,064 Da for the mouse protein, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of human TPST-2 (Fig. 1) is 96% identical to that of mouse TPST-2. Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity plots of human and mouse TPST-2 (not shown) reveal a 17-residue hydrophobic segment near the NH2 terminus (27Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar). This segment is preceded by basic residues and is not followed by a suitable signal peptidase cleavage site. This indicates that TPST-2 has type II transmembrane topology. Both polypeptides have two potential sites forN-linked glycosylation and six lumenal cysteines. The amino acid sequences of human and mouse TPST-2 are 67 and 65% identical to human and mouse TPST-1, respectively. Full-length human and mouse TPST-2 were transiently expressed in 293-T cells as HPC4 fusion proteins. Extracts of cells transfected with empty plasmid or plasmid encoding human and mouse fusion proteins were prepared and assayed using a PSGL-1 peptide substrate (QATEYEYLDYDFLPEC). This peptide spans the three potential tyrosine sulfation sites in PSGL-1 (28Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cumming D.A. Larsen G.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) and was previously shown to serve as a substrate for TPST-1 (24Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The specific activity of mock transfected 293-T cell extracts was 0.06 ± 0.01 units/mg (mean ± S.D., n = 6). When cells were transfected with human or mouse TPST-2 cDNA, the specific activity of 293-T cell extracts increased 112-fold (7.07 ± 1.28 units/mg,n = 3) and 46-fold (2.91 ± 0.86 units/mg,n = 5), respectively. TPST activity was not detectable in culture supernatants of cells transfected with TPST-2 cDNAs. 293-T cells were also transfected with cDNAs encoding soluble forms of human and mouse TPST-2 with NH2-terminal HPC4 epitopes. Assays of conditioned media indicated that TPST-2 was efficiently secreted in an active form. Conditioned medium from cells transfected with soluble human TPST-2 fusion protein was analyzed by Western blotting using HPC4 and an antiserum against the COOH-terminal 16 amino acids of TPST-2 (Fig. 2). Both HPC4 and the COOH-terminal peptide antiserum detected two closely space polypeptides of approximately 47 and 44 kDa. This demonstrates that TPST-2 is secreted as two distinct isoforms that are not the result of proteolytic degradation. To determine the structural basis for this heterogeneity, partially purified soluble TPST-2 was either sham-treated or treated with peptide N-glycosidase F and analyzed by Western blotting using the COOH-terminal peptide antiserum (Fig. 2). We observed that enzyme-treated TPST-2 migrated as a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of ≈41 kDa. This result demonstrates that soluble TPST-2 is secreted with either one or twoN-glycan chains. However, peptide N-glycosidase F-treated TPST-2 still appears somewhat heterogeneous, suggesting that it may contain O-linked glycosylation or perhaps some other post-translational modification. To determine whether TPST-1 and TPST-2 catalyze sulfation of other substrates, extracts of human TPST-1- and TPST-2-transfected 293-T cells were assayed using peptide substrates modeled on known tyrosine sulfation sites in heparin cofactor II (HCII) and the α chain of the fourth component of complement (C4α) (12Hortin G. Tollefsen D.M. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15827-15830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hortin G. Sims H. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1786-1793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In parallel duplicate assays of extracts from three independent transfections, we observed that TPST-1 efficiently sulfated the PSGL-1, HCII, and C4α peptides (Fig. 3). The lower specific activity observed using the HCII peptide may be because it has only a single tyrosine, in contrast to the PSGL-1 and C4α peptides, which have three. We observed that the specific activity of extracts of TPST-1- and TPST-2-transfected 293-T cell were comparable using the PSGL-1 peptide as a substrate. In contrast, the specific activity of extracts of TPST-1-transfected cells was 21-fold higher using the HCII peptide as substrate and 9-fold higher using the C4α peptide when compared with TPST-2 extracts assayed in parallel. These preliminary experiments suggest that TPST-1 and TPST-2 differ in their specificities toward small peptide substrates in vitro. cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random hexamer priming with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and used to probe Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (24Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This analysis showed a ≈1.8–2.0 kb TPST-2 transcript in all human and mouse tissues examined (Fig. 4). The larger hybridizing species observed in pancreatic tissue likely represent incompletely processed transcripts. Searches of the NCBI data base revealed that sequences matching the human TPST-2 cDNA were located in a human BAC clone (445C9, GenBankTM accession number Z95115). This BAC clone was sequenced at the Sanger Center (Cambridge, UK) and maps to chromosome 22q12.1. Alignment of the cDNA and genomic sequence shows that the TPST-2 gene spans ≈63.4 kilobase pairs and contains 7 exons and 6 introns (Fig. 5). The TPST-2 gene is centromeric to two known genes in the BAC clone, β B1-crystallin and β A4-crystallin, and is transcribed from telomere to centromere. Intron 1 is unusually large (≈45.4 kb) and contains a high mobility group-1 pseudogene (30Ferrari S. Finelli P. Rocchi M. Bianchi M.E. Genomics. 1996; 35: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The coding region spans exons III to VI. The nucleotide sequence at the 5′ donor and 3′ acceptor sites of all introns conform to the GT..AG rule (31Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). There were only three nucleotides in the human TPST-2 cDNA sequence that did not match the published genomic sequence. Two are conservative substitutions in the coding region (C467 → G, T897 → C), and one is in the 3′-UTR (C1847→ T), 7 nucleotides 5′ to the polyadenylation site. Warden et al. (32Warden C.H. Mehrabian M. He K.Y. Yoon M.Y. Diep A. Xia Y.R. Wen P.Z. Svenson K.L. Sparkes R.S. Lusis A.J. Genomics. 1993; 18: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reported the chromosomal mapping of 40 mouse liver cDNA clones by interspecies backcross analysis. One of the mapped EST clones (m1650) was partially sequenced on both strands (GenBankTM accession numbers L11849 and L12133). These sequences are >95% identical to nucleotides 12–155 and nucleotides 1109–1544 of the mouse TPST-2 cDNA, respectively. This EST clone defines the D5Ucla3 locus located in the central region of mouse chromosome 5 (Mouse Genome Data Base, The Jackson Laboratories). Searches of the NCBI data base also identified two overlapping C. elegans EST clones (yk166c1 and yk363g6). These clones were obtained from Dr. Yuji Kohara (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan), and the nucleotide sequences of both strands were determined. Clone yk166c1 is a full-length cDNA with a 1416-bp insert comprised of a 54-nucleotide 5′-UTR, a 1140-nucleotide coding region, and a 222-nucleotide 3′-UTR. The C. elegans cDNA predicts a protein of 380 amino acids that we designate TPST-A. Hydropathy analysis indicates that the protein has type II transmembrane topology (not shown). The polypeptide has one potentialN-glycosylation site and five lumenal cysteine residues. Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence of the C. elegans protein to the human proteins show that it is 54 and 52% identical to human TPST-1 and TPST-2, respectively (Fig. 6). C. elegans TPST-A was expressed as a full-length protein in 293-T cells from the unmodified pcDNA3.1(+) vector. Transfection of 293-T cells with C. elegans TPST-A cDNA resulted in a 40-fold increase in the specific activity of the cell extracts when compared with mock transfected controls using the PSGL-1 peptide as substrate (n = 2). Searches of the high throughput genomic sequence data base indicates that the TPST-A is located on a yeast artificial chromosome clone mapped to the right arm of chromosome III (Y111B2, GenBankTM accession number Z98857) that is currently being sequenced at the Sanger Center (33Coulson A. Waterston R. Kiff J. Sulston J. Kohara Y. Nature. 1988; 335: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 34Coulson A. Kozona Y. Lutterbach B. Shownkeen R. Sulston J. Waterston R.

Biol. 1993; 58: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Data base searches also revealed a second putative C. elegans TPST gene. This gene is in cosmid F42G9 (GenBankTM accession number U00051) that was sequenced at the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University (St. Louis, MO) and maps to the left arm of chromosome III. The cosmid contains a predicted open reading frame, designated F42G9.8, which predicts a 359-amino acid type II transmembrane protein. Alignment of TPST-A and F42G9.8 reveals a 39% identity and 62% similarity at the amino acid level. However, it is not known whether F42G9.8 encodes a TPST. Tyrosine O-sulfation is a common post-translational modification in eukaryotes mediated by a Golgi enzyme activity called tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST). We recently reported the isolation and characterization of human and mouse cDNAs encoding TPST-1 (24Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation and expression of human and mouse cDNAs encoding a second member of the TPST family, TPST-2. The human and mouse TPST-2 cDNAs predict type II transmembrane proteins of 377 and 376 amino acid residues, respectively. The predicted molecular weight of the TPST-2 coding region, in conjunction with the two potential N-glycosylation sites, is consistent with the size of recombinant TPST-2 as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When transfected into mammalian cells, human and mouse cDNAs encoding either full-length or soluble forms of TPST induce overexpression of TPST activity in cell extracts and conditioned medium, respectively. These data demonstrate that the cDNAs encode a tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase. We have also identified a cDNA from the nematode C. elegans encoding a 380-amino acid type II protein that induces overexpression of TPST activity when expressed in mammalian cells. In addition, it is likely that F42G9.8 gene product encodes a second C. elegans TPST. Fig. 6 shows the alignment of human TPST-1, human TPST-2, and C. elegans TPST-A. Sequence identity between the three TPSTs is restricted to the COOH-terminal portion of the proteins with very little homology in the NH2-terminal ≈70 amino acids. The relative positions of all of the intralumenal cysteine residues in TPST-1 are conserved in TPST-2. However, in C. elegansTPST-A the most membrane proximal intralumenal cysteine is absent. Kakuta et al. (36Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 129-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 37Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) have defined two structural motifs common to most cytosolic and membrane-bound sulfotransferases. In the mouse estrogen sulfotransferase crystal structure these regions are involved in binding of the 5′ and 3′ phosphate on the sulfate donor PAPS. These motifs are highly conserved in the three TPSTs (Fig. 6). Previous work indicates that TPST activity is localized to thetrans-Golgi in mammalian cells (22Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 38Rens D.S. Roth J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 899-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lee R.W.H. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6143-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that TPST-2, like TPST-1, is a membrane-bound Golgi enzyme. TPST-2 is predicted to have type II topology, like most known Golgi sulfotransferases and glycosyltransferases. The presence of N-linked glycans demonstrates that TPST-2, like TPST-1, transits the Golgi compartment. Furthermore, TPST activity was not detectable in culture supernatant of 293-T cells overexpressing full-length TPST-2, suggesting that it is retained in an intracellular compartment. Our previous study demonstrated that TPST activity measured using the PSGL-1 peptide as substrate was detectable only in the microsomal fraction of crude rat liver homogenates. We also provided evidence that the active site of the enzyme(s) were lumenally oriented in microsomes (24Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Given that the PSGL-1 peptide is a substrate for both TPST-1 and TPST-2, this would suggest that the enzymes have a similar subcellular localization and active site orientation in microsomal membranes. However, the subcellular localization of TPST-1 and TPST-2 have not been rigorously determined. TPST-1- and TPST-2-specific transcripts are present in many mammalian tissues. In addition, both transcripts are present in multiple tumor cell lines and in human umbilical cell vein endothelial cells as assessed by Northern blotting. 2Y. B. Ouyang and K. L. Moore, unpublished observations. These data suggest that TPST-1 and TPST-2 are coexpressed in many, if not all, mammalian cells. These observations raise the question as to whether the two enzymes are functionally redundant or alternatively whether they have preferred substrates. Our observation that TPST-1 and TPST-2 may differ in their ability to mediate tyrosine O-sulfation of certain small peptide substrates in vitro supports the latter hypothesis. Determination of kinetic rate constants of both enzymes toward various substrates will be required to determine the kinetic basis for these differences. It is not known whether the two enzymes differentially sulfate native protein substrates. Development of expression systems lacking one or both enzymes will be required to address the more complicated question as to whether the two enzymes have distinct macromolecular specificities in intact cells or organisms. In summary, we have cloned and expressed a second mammalian sulfotransferase and a C. elegans sulfotransferase that catalyze tyrosine O-sulfation. These enzymes may catalyze tyrosine O-sulfation of a variety of protein substrates involved in diverse physiologic functions. We thank Vickie Gurfinkel for technical assistance."

Published evidence strongly suggests that the binding of Mcm proteins to chromatin is contingent upon the prior binding of Orc proteins. Here we use two different approaches to investigate the presence of the human ORC2 protein and of Mcm proteins on chromatin of HeLa cells in various cell cycle phases. First, we mobilized chromatin-bound proteins by micrococcal nuclease and analyzed the resulting digestion products by sucrose gradient centrifugations. Under digestion conditions when Mcm proteins were almost entirely released from chromatin, ORC2 protein was found to be associated with chromatin fragments containing several hundred base pairs of DNA. Second, we used an in vivocross-linking procedure to covalently link Mcm proteins and ORC2 to DNA by short exposure of intact HeLa cells to formaldehyde. Specific immunoprecipitations revealed that cross-linked nucleoprotein fragments carried either Mcm proteins or ORC2 protein, but not both. Based on the lengths of the DNA fragments in immunoprecipitates, we estimate that the distance between chromatin-bound ORC2 protein and chromatin-bound Mcm proteins must be at least 500–1000 base pairs in HeLa cells.

Considerable progress has recently been made in describing the components of the machinery required for the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication. Much of the original work was performed studying yeast mutants that had lost the ability to perform defined steps in the progression of proliferating cells through the late G1phase or early S phase of the cell cycle. Genetic studies were complemented by cell biological and biochemical experiments leading to the identification of yeast DNA elements, known as ARS (autonomously replicating sequences), which serve as origins of replication, and of the six-membered protein complex origin recognition complex (Orc)1 which binds to ARS elements in an ATP-dependent manner (1Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Refs.2Coverley D. Laskey R.A. Annu. Rev.

Additional initiation functions are performed by proteins of the Mcm family, which were so named because of their involvement in yeast minichromosome maintenance (5Tye B.K. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 160-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Counterparts of most of the yeast proteins, including members of ORC and of the Mcm protein family, have been detected in a large variety of eukaryotic organisms and are most probably common to all eukaryotes (reviewed in Refs. 6Chong J.P.J.

Experiments, performed with yeast cells and with protein extracts fromXenopus eggs, have provided a clear picture with regard to the order of events that lead to the formation of preinitiation complexes on chromatin. Accordingly, Orc proteins, bound to replication start sites, recruit the Cdc6-encoded protein (Cdc6p) as a requirement for the subsequent binding of Mcm proteins (8Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A.

Bound Cdc6p is inactivated and degraded at the beginning of S phase, whereas Mcm proteins are released from their chromatin sites during the course of DNA replication (reviewed in Refs. 2Coverley D.

Consequently, newly replicated sections of chromatin are free of Mcm proteins and can therefore not re-replicate during the same cell cycle (18Chong J.P.J. Mahbubani H.M. Khoo C.Y. Blow J.J.

They appear to be either free in the nucleoplasm or bound to chromatin. Although not yet formally proven, it can be assumed that the binding of mammalian Mcm proteins to chromatin is also contingent upon the previous binding of Orc proteins and Cdc6 protein. The fraction of structure-bound mammalian Mcm proteins is highest at the beginning of S phase, but gradually decreases during progression of replication (21Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 22Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J.

Released nucleoplasmic Mcm proteins are found as large multiprotein complexes, composed of the six known members of the Mcm protein family. This complex has the tendency to desintegrate into more stable subcomplexes of which one is a dimer of the MCM3 protein (MCM3p) and the MCM5 protein (MCM5p), while the second is a trimer of proteins MCM4 (MCM4p), MCM6 (MCM6p), and MCM7 (MCM7p). The sixth member of the family, human protein MCM2 (MCM2p), is usually found to be loosely associated with these subcomplexes (24Burkhart R. Schulte D. Hu B. Musahl C. Göhring F. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J.

The present study was performed to investigate the mode of binding of Mcm proteins and ORC2p, a member of the origin recognition complex, on human chromatin. We prepared chromatin from proliferating human HeLa cells using low ionic strength conditions in the presence of the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40. As first shown by Hancock (27Hancock R. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the nuclear envelope is removed by this procedure, while the general form and the ultrastructural characteristics of chromatin appear to remain largely unchanged. The maintenance of form in this structure allows biochemical manipulations such as pipetting and low speed centrifugations for a separation of structure-bound from soluble nuclear material. We have used these preparations before to investigate the chromatin-associated fraction of MCM6p, and found that the protein can be released from chromatin by a treatment with micrococcal nuclease (26Holthoff H.P. Baack M. Richter A. Ritzi M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7320-7325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We expected to find ORC2p and Mcm proteins on the same chromatin fragments, but our results showed that this is not the case and imply that Mcm proteins and ORC2p are located on different chromatin sites. This conclusion was supported by results obtained through formaldehyde cross-linking in vivo. Human HeLa S3 cells were grown to approximately 5 × 107 cells on 14.5-cm plastic dishes in Dulbecco′s modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were synchronized at the start of the S phase by a double thymidine block. Exponentially growing HeLa cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 16 h and then released into thymidine-free medium. After about 9 h, thymidine was added again to the cells for another 14 h before release into fresh thymidine-free medium (28Johnson R.T. Downes C.S. Meyns R.E. Fantes P. Brooks R. The Cell Cycle: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1993: 1-24Google Scholar). Chromatin was prepared using buffers with very low ionic strengths in a modification of the procedure originally described by Hancock (27Hancock R. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells on plates were washed three times with 30 ml each of 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). The cells, still attached to the plate, were incubated for 20 min at 5 °C with 50 ml of 0.25 mm EDTA, inducing swelling and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. The released nuclei were concentrated by low speed centrifugation (5 min at 700 ×g) and washed again with 20 ml of 0.25 mm EDTA. The pellet was then resuspended in 4 ml of 0.25 mm EDTA plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged through a 20-ml sucrose cushion (0.1 m sucrose in 0.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) for 10 min at 4,000 × g. Pellets were suspended in 2 ml 0.25 mm EDTA and again centrifuged through a sucrose cushion as above to remove the remaining traces of Nonidet P-40. The final pellet was resuspended in 0.25 mm EDTA to give a final concentration corresponding to 500 μg of DNA/ml. In vivo cross-linking of HeLa cells growing on plastic dishes was performed exactly as described by Göhring and Fackelmayer (29Göhring F. Fackelmayer F.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). DNA concentrations were determined by fluorimetry with a Hoechst 33258 in a fluorometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). Chromatin bodies were treated with micrococal nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and under the conditions explained in the text. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 mm EDTA. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Chromatin fragments in the supernatant were analyzed by centrifugation (14–16 h at 40,000 rotations/min in the Beckman SW40 rotor) through sucrose gradients (40 to 5% gradient in 0.5 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA; pH 8.5). The gradients were pumped after centrifugation through a quartz cuvette to monitor the absorbance at 254 nm before fractionation. DNA fragments were analyzed after deproteinization by agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (30Krude T. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6257-6267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Peptide (DEFD) antibodies are directed against a synthetic 17-amino acid polypeptide common to all mammalian Mcm proteins. The antibodies react with the six human Mcm proteins as described previously (25Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Hu B. Burkhart R. Schulte D. Musahl C. Knippers R.

Biochem. 1996; 235: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies against the individual human proteins MCM2, MCM3, MCM4, MCM5, MCM6, and MCM7 have been described and characterized before (24Burkhart R. Schulte D. Hu B. Musahl C. Göhring F. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1996; 235: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To prepare antibodies against ORC2p, the carboxyl-terminal fragment of hORC2 (residues 329–577) was amplified from reverse-transcribed HeLa RNA and cloned into a pET23a vector (Novagen). The recombinant polypeptide was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified on nickel-agarose (Qiagen), and injected into rabbits. The recombinant polypeptide was immobilized on a SulfoLink Gel (Pierce) and used to affinity-purify the antibodies. Antibodies were used for immunoblotting experiments essentially as originally described by Towbin et al. (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44918) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (25Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The membranes were washed extensively in a Tris-NaCl buffer containing 0.5% Tween-20 and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer′s instruction. As previously demonstrated (25Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Richter A. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and confirmed in the present study (not shown), about one half of nuclear Mcm proteins is free in the nucleosol of prereplicative HeLa cells, while the second half is bound to chromatin. To investigate chromatin-bound proteins we used the classic method of Hancock (27Hancock R. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) for the preparation of chromatin from HeLa cells. The method involves a treatment of washed cells with buffers of very low ionic strengths in the presence of the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40. As explained before, this treatment causes a dissociation of MCM2p while the other Mcm proteins remain bound to chromatin (26Holthoff H.P. Baack M. Richter A. Ritzi M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7320-7325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We show now that these chromatin preparations also contain ORC2p (molecular mass, 67 kDa) (35Gavin K.A. Hidaka M. Stillman B. Science. 1995; 270: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), a constituent of the human origin recognition complex (Fig. 1). Immunofluorescence studies with nuclei from cultured mammalian cells had previously shown that Mcm proteins dissociate from their chromatin binding sites when cells progress through the S phase of the cell cycle (21Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 22Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 23Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if our chromatin preparations reflect the situationin vivo, we would expect to see relatively high amounts of Mcm proteins on isolated chromatin from early S phase cells, and decreasing amounts on chromatin from later stages of the S phase. To address this point, we prepared chromatin from HeLa cells, arrested by a double-thymidine block at the transition between G1 and S phase, as well as from cells at various times after release of the arrest. Synthesis of DNA, as determined by the incorporation of labeled DNA precursors, started between 2 and 3 h after removal of thymidine and then continued for approximately 6 h. The end of the S phase partially overlapped with the beginning of mitoses, probably reflecting variations in individual cell cycle times (Fig. 1 A). Preparation of chromatin during mitosis did, of course, not produce the spherical chromatin structures as described above for interphase chromatin, but yielded an unstructured dense chromatin mass, which could nevertheless be precipitated by low speed centrifugation for further investigations. Using specific antibodies in immunoblot experiments, we determined that Mcm proteins on chromatin decreased during S phase, but rapidly bound to chromatin again after completion of mitosis (Fig. 1 B). However, ORC2p remained bound to chromatin during all stages of the HeLa cell cycle including mitosis (Fig. 1 C). Similar observations have been reported before for Orc proteins of yeast (12Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar,13Liang C Stillman B Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 17Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 36Diffley J.F.X. Cocker R.H. Nature. 1992; 357: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and of Xenopus, although boundXenopus Orc proteins can be detected only on anaphase and telophase chromosomes, but not on metaphase chromosomes (8Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The synchronization of the HeLa cell cycle is not precise enough to decide whether ORC2p remained on human metaphase chromosomes or not. Aphidicolin, an inhibitor of replicative DNA polymerases, has been reported to prevent the loss of Mcm proteins from Xenopuschromatin (18Chong J.P.J. Mahbubani H.M. Khoo C.Y. Blow J.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 37Madine M.A. Khoo C.Y. Mills A.D. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1270-1279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In agreement with these earlier findings, we could also show for HeLa cells that, when aphidicolin was added to synchronized cells between 1 and 3 h after start of growth, Mcm proteins did not dissociate and remained bound to chromatin during the following 7 h (not shown). In summary, the experiment with isolated chromatin mirrors the cycle of Mcm dissociation and reassociation, as described previously for HeLa cells in vivo (23Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and shows furthermore that chromatin-bound ORC2p does not dissociate in proliferating human cells. The experiment is also of interest for technical reasons because it excludes the possibility that Mcm proteins may be artifactually trapped in chromatin pellets. We digested isolated chromatin with micrococcal nuclease, an enzyme that preferentially cleaves the linker DNA between adjacent nucleosomes (reviewed in Ref.40Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). Mcm proteins were released together with fragmented DNA in a reaction which depended on the amounts of enzyme used (Fig. 2 A, panel a) or on the time of incubation (Fig. 2 B, panel a) (26Holthoff H.P. Baack M. Richter A. Ritzi M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7320-7325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Proteins remained stably bound to chromatin incubated in enzyme buffer without micrococcal nuclease. ORC2p was also mobilized from chromatin by nuclease treatment (panels b in Fig. 2, A and B) at a rate that paralleled the release of chromatin fragments (panel c in Fig. 2 B). In control experiments, we demonstrated that a treatment of chromatin with RNase A did not mobilize Mcm proteins or ORC2p (not shown). Micrococcal nuclease degrades chromatin to fragments whose sizes depend on the extent of digestion. We investigated whether Mcm proteins and ORC2p remained bound to chromatin fragments. For this purpose, chromatin was prepared from HeLa cells, arrested by a double thymidine block at the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle, as well as from cells at 5 and 13 h after the removal of excess thymidine (see Fig. 1). The chromatin preparations were treated in parallel with micrococcal nuclease, and the chromatin digestion products were sedimented through sucrose gradients in buffers with low salt concentration. In Fig. 3 we show the gradient analysis of chromatin digests from HeLa cells arrested at the boundary between G1 and S phase. But very similar data were obtained analyzing sucrose gradients with chromatin digests from S phase cells (5 h after release from the double thymidine block) and from G1 phase cells (13 h after release) (not shown). The positions of chromatin fragments were determined by their absorbance of ultraviolet light at 254 nm and confirmed by a gel electrophoretic analysis of histones. We could thus determine the positions in the gradient of chromatin fragments bearing one, two, or more nucleosomes (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblotting experiments showed that MCM3p appeared at two positions, as a free monomeric protein, sedimenting at about 4 S, and as a larger complex together with MCM5p, sedimenting at about 12 S, just in front of the mononucleosomal peak (Fig. 3 B). MCM3p and MCM5p in the 12 S peak could be immunoprecipitated with MCM3-specific antibodies (not shown) and must therefore be closely associated (24Burkhart R. Schulte D. Hu B. Musahl C. Göhring F. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We have used specific antibodies directed against MCM6p, MCM4p, and MCM7p in immunoblot experiments to determine the distribution of these proteins in the gradient. A minor portion of MCM6p appeared as free protein sedimenting at 4 S, much like free MCM3p, but the remaining and larger part of MCM6p was distributed together with MCM4p over many of the faster sedimenting fractions in the gradient with a maximum just behind the peak of mononucleosomes (Fig. 3 B). Holthoffet al. (26Holthoff H.P. Baack M. Richter A. Ritzi M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7320-7325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have described before this distribution of chromatin-derived MCM6p and noted that MCM6p, but also MCM4p and MCM7p, tend to aggregate when they are released from chromatin under the low salt conditions used. The distribution in the gradient of MCM7p partially overlaps the MCM3p/MCM5p peak as well as the MCM4p/MCM6p peaks. We also determined the position of ORC2p in the sucrose gradient, and found that its sedimentation properties were clearly different from those of the Mcm proteins (Fig. 3 C). In fact, its high sedimentation rates suggested that ORC2p remained associated with fragmented chromatin in contrast to the Mcm proteins, which sedimented largely independent of nucleosomes. To further investigate this possibility, we performed sucrose gradient centrifugations of chromatin fragments obtained after short (5 min) and after longer (40 min) treatment with micrococcal nuclease. As expected, the fraction of oligonucleosomes decreased while the fraction of mononucleosomes increased with digestion times (panels a in Fig. 4). After a short digestion time, ORC2p appeared as a broad peak together with oligonucleosomes (panel b in Fig. 4 A), but, after longer digestion, ORC2p was found in a slower sedimenting complex between the mononucleosomal and the dinucleosomal peak (panel b in Fig. 4 B). This result indicates that continued nuclease treatment removed any excess DNA that remained bound to ORC2p after short digestion. More extended nuclease digestion using higher enzyme concentrations or longer incubation times did not further change the sedimentation rate of the ORC2p-containing complex (not shown). The ORC2p-containing complex most likely included the other Orc proteins as well because Gavin et al. (35Gavin K.A. Hidaka M. Stillman B. Science. 1995; 270: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) could immunoprecipitate ORC2p in association with other human Orc proteins. The six-membered Orc has a combined molecular mass of approximately 400 kDa (35Gavin K.A. Hidaka M. Stillman B. Science. 1995; 270: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and could have a sedimentation coefficient of 13 S, like the ORC2p-containing peak in Fig. 4 B (estimated relative to the sedimentation coefficient of mononucleosomes; 10–11 S). For comparisons, we also determined the distribution of MCM3p in the sucrose gradient of Fig. 4. As already shown above, one part of Mcm3p was recovered as a monomeric protein at 4 S, while another part sedimented at about 12 S, both after short and long digestion times (panels b of Fig. 4). The 12 S peak of MCM3p exhibited a leading shoulder after short, but a more symmetric distribution after longer, digestion times, probably suggesting that residual pieces of DNA, which still remained on MCM3p after brief nuclease treatment, were later degraded. Using the appropriate antibodies, we found again (see Fig. 3) that MCM5p was present in the 12 S peak, but not in the 4 S peak of MCM3p (not shown, but see Holthoff et al. (26Holthoff H.P. Baack M. Richter A. Ritzi M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7320-7325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) for a detailed description of Mcm proteins on micrococcal nuclease digests of chromatin). To summarize the data of this section we note that rather short digestion times were sufficient to mobilize chromatin-bound Mcm proteins (Fig. 2), suggesting that Mcm proteins may reside on chromatin sites which are more open to nuclease attack than bulk chromatin. Furthermore, sucrose gradient analyses of digestion products revealed that most Mcm proteins sedimented largely independent of nucleosomes whereas ORC2p remained bound to oligosomal chromatin fragments. This indicates that ORC2p and Mcm proteins are probably not located at closely adjacent sites. To support this conclusion we resorted to an entirely different experimental approach, namely in vivocross-linking of chromatin proteins to DNA. We have used a procedure, described in detail by Göhring and Fackelmayer (29Göhring F. Fackelmayer F.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which involves a treatment of growing HeLa cells with 1% formaldehyde. Nuclei from formaldehyde-treated cells were lysed in sodium Sarkosyl and centrifuged through a CsCl step gradient to remove the proteins that were not cross-linked to DNA. The nucleoprotein complex was then sheared to give fragments with DNA of 500–1000 base pair lengths, which were recentrifuged in a CsCl equilibrium gradient until the remaining nucleoprotein fragments had accumulated at the buoyant density characteristic for their protein/DNA ratios (29Göhring F. Fackelmayer F.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Covalent linkages between proteins and between proteins and DNA were cleaved by boiling in electrophoresis sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and sodium dodecylsulfate (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). Following this procedure, Burkhartet al. (24Burkhart R. Schulte D. Hu B. Musahl C. Göhring F. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) had previously shown that MCM3p was present in the cross-linked nucleoprotein complexes recovered after CsCl equilibrium centrifugation. To demonstrate the efficiency of the cross-linking procedure, we first performed an experiment exposing growing HeLa cells to formaldehyde for increasing lengths of time. The recovered nucleoprotein complexes were investigated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining showing that significant amounts of histones were covalently linked to DNA already after 2–4 min cross-linking time while non-histone proteins appeared at later times in the nucleoprotein complexes (Fig. 5 A). Mcm proteins were among the non-histone proteins as shown by immunoblotting with antibodies that recognize the most conserved region of all Mcm proteins including the central DEFD motif (Fig. 5 B). Since MCM3p and MCM6p are not well separated by standard polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (26Holthoff H.P. Baack M. Richter A. Ritzi M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7320-7325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the blots used in Fig. 5 B were stripped and reprobed with MCM6-specific antibodies (Fig. 5 B). Cross-linking of Mcm proteins to DNA was detectable after 8 min of treatment with formaldehyde, but continued for up to 30 min, whereas cross-linking of ORC2p began as early as 4 min and was essentially complete after 8 min cross-linking time (Fig. 5 C). As a control, we analyzed for the scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A) (41Göhring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) in cross-linked nucleoprotein and found that this protein was efficiently coupled to DNA after only 2–4 min (Fig. 5 D). The different rates at which proteins were cross-linked to DNA may reflect their position in chromatin. Thus, SAF-A is known to be in immediate contact with DNA and cross-linked to DNA almost as efficiently as histones, but ORC2p may be bound to DNA via other members of the origin recognition complex (42Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and therefore cross-linked later than SAF-A, but earlier than Mcm proteins, which are probably tethered to DNA via other proteins, possibly including histones (43Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We treated HeLa cells at different cell cycle stages (Fig. 6 A) for 8 min with formaldehyde and prepared cross-linked nucleoprotein complexes as just described. Cross-linked nucleoprotein complexes were immunprecipitated using several specific antibodies. The results show that immunoprecipitated nucleoprotein fragments, obtained through Mcm-specific antibodies, carried Mcm proteins, but not ORC2p; and precipitates, obtained through ORC2-specific antibodies, carried ORC2p, but not Mcm proteins (Fig. 6 A). The diffuse bands in the ORC2 lane in panel a of Fig. 6 B have not been characterized, but their relation to one of the Mcm proteins could be excluded because the bands did not react with individual Mcm-specific antibodies (not shown). Since 8 min of cross-linking time was sufficient to covalently link essentially all detectable ORC2p to DNA (Fig. 5), we may expect to see at least some ORC2p on Mcm-bearing nucleoprotein, if both proteins were present on one DNA fragment. This was not observed. Thus, the results of Fig. 6 A support our conclusion that ORC2p and Mcm proteins are not located at identical or closely adjacent sites in HeLa cell chromatin. Based on the lengths of the DNA fragments in immunoprecipitated nucleoprotein (Fig. 6 A), we estimate that the distance between bound ORC2p and bound Mcm proteins must be at least 1000 base pairs. An inspection of Mcm-bearing nucleoprotein fragments is instructive (Fig. 6 A). MCM3-specific antibodies precipitated nucleoprotein fragments with bound MCM3p, as expected, but these fragments also carried MCM5p and MCM7p. Likewise, MCM5-specific antibodies reacted with nucleoprotein carrying MCM5p as well as MCM3p and MCM7p. However, MCM4-specific antibodies precipitated nucleoprotein fragments with MCM4p, MCM6p, and MCM7p, but without MCM3p and MCM5p. MCM2p was present on immunoprecipitated nucleoproteins in amounts too low to be detected by the DEFD antibodies, but the protein could well be identified by MCM2-specific antibodies in all Mcm-bearing nucleoprotein (Fig. 6 C). These results are consistent with the sucrose gradient analysis of Fig. 3 where we detected stable MCM3p-MCM5p dimers (24Burkhart R. Schulte D. Hu B. Musahl C. Göhring F. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) as well as cosedimenting MCM4p and MCM6p, while MCM7p overlaps the peaks of other Mcm proteins (Fig. 3). The results probably indicate a dynamic state of chromatin-bound Mcm proteins that are not necessarily organized as a hexameric complex such as soluble nucleosolic Mcm proteins (34Richter A. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 44Kimura H. Ohtomo T. Yamaguchi M. Ishii A. Sugimoto I. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 977-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 45Tsuruga H. Yabuta N. Hosoya S. Zamura K. Endo Y. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The experiment shown in Fig. 6 was performed with nuclei from formaldehyde-treated cells arrested by a double thymidine block, but identical results were obtained with nuclei from cells treated with formaldehyde at 5 h and at 13 h after release from the block (not shown). Evidence obtained through experiments in yeast and Xenopus had clearly shown that the replication preinitiation complex is assembled in an ordered sequence as Orc recruits CDC6p, which in turn recruits Mcm proteins (see Introduction). It is likely that the order of events is similar in mammalian cells. As a first step in the investigation of the preinitiation complex in human cells, we prepared chromatin from HeLa cells and digested it with micrococcal nuclease with the intention of producing chromatin fragments carrying the relevant protein components. We report now that, contrary to our expectation, Mcm proteins and ORC2p do not reside at closely adjacent sites in HeLa cells arrested by a double thymidine block at the G1/S phase boundary, as well as in cells released from the proliferation block. Our conclusion is based on two different observations. First, chromatin was isolated and washed to effectively remove free nucleosolic Mcm proteins. Isolated chromatin was then treated with micrococcal nuclease to produce chromatin fragments, which were further investigated by gradient centrifugation. As shown above, gradient centrifugation separates digestion products with Mcm proteins from digestion products with ORC2p. After short digestion times ORC2p was found to be associated with faster sedimenting oligonucleosomes while most Mcm proteins were recovered in slower sedimenting parts of the gradients and were either free or bound to small pieces of DNA. Second, chromatin proteins were covalently linked to DNA by a treatment of cells with formaldehyde. Cross-linked nucleoprotein fragments were obtained after equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl gradients and analyzed by immunoprecipitations using Mcm-specific or ORC2p-specific antibodies. Precipitated nucleoprotein fragments contained either Mcm proteins or ORC2p, but not both. The DNA in immunoprecipitated nucleoprotein is 500–1000 base pairs long, which gives a lower limit for the distance between chromatin-bound ORC2p and chromatin-bound Mcm proteins. We shall perform experiments using cross-linked nucleoprotein complexes with increasingly longer DNA fragments to more precisely estimate the distance between Orc and Mcms in synchronously proliferating HeLa cells. Several lines of evidence from studies with other systems suggest that Orc proteins and Mcm proteins are not necessarily bound to identical chromatin sites. Donovan et al. (11Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L.S. Diffley J.F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5611-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) were able to remove Orc proteins from yeast chromatin by salt extraction without affecting the binding of Mcm proteins; and Hua and Newport (14Hua X, H. Newport J J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) could dissociateXenopus Orc proteins, but not Mcm proteins in the presence of increased concentrations of Cdc2-cyclin A kinase. These data imply that Mcm proteins cannot be tethered to chromatin via Orc. This leads to a model suggesting that Orc and its associated CDC6p channels Mcm proteins to chromatin, but, once bound, Mcm proteins may move to other sites (12Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) which are closely adjacent in yeast (13Liang C Stillman B Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), but may be more distant in mammalians. Furthermore, Aparicio et al. (17Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) could show that Mcm proteins leave their original sites after initiation of replication and move to DNA segments on both sides of the origin. It is now possible that the process of separation between Orc and Mcm proteins is already initiated in HeLa cells long before the beginning of DNA replication as measured by the incorporation of nucleoside precursors. The experiments described in this communication also give some relevant new information with regard to the organization of chromatin-bound Mcm proteins. First, a short treatment with micrococcal nuclease suffices to release Mcm proteins from their chromatin sites. This may indicate that chromatin regions with bound Mcm proteins are relatively unprotected against micrococcal nuclease attack and therefore structurally distinct from bulk chromatin. The difference could be a more extended conformation of Mcm-carrying chromatin regions or a lack of nucleosomes in the vicinity of bound Mcm proteins. We are currently performing experiments to distinguish between these possibilities. Second, centrifugation analysis of digested chromatin in low salt buffer shows that MCM3p appeared at two peak positions in the sucrose gradient, at 12 S together with MCM5p and at 4 S as a free monomer. On the other hand, MCM4p, MCM6p, and MCM7p form aggregates that are spread out over a larger section of the gradient (26Holthoff H.P. Baack M. Richter A. Ritzi M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7320-7325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The result is consistent with the observations that a MCM3p-MCM5p dimer and a complex of MCM4p, MCM6p, and MCM7p, together with MCM2p, are obtained when HeLa chromatin is treated with 0.4 m NaCl for the preparation of isolated Mcm proteins (24Burkhart R. Schulte D. Hu B. Musahl C. Göhring F. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 46Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The data are also in agreement with our cross-linking experiments which show that MCM3p-MCM5p complexes and MCM4p-MCM6p complexes tend to partition to distinct nucleoprotein fragments, but some overlap exists as MCM2p and MCM7p were found on all Mcm-bearing nucleoprotein fragments. These results suggest that the interactions between chromatin-bound Mcm proteins may be more dynamic and more complex than previously thought. Indeed, the composition of chromatin-bound Mcm complexes may vary with their functions before and during S phase. These functions have yet to be determined, although the recent report of Ishimi (46Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) on an Mcm-associated DNA-unwinding activity should be an interesting clue for further research.

PC12 cells were stably transfected with α1A-, α2A-, or β1-adrenergic receptors (ARs) in an inducible expression vector, and subclones were characterized. Norepinephrine stimulated inositol phosphate formation in α1A-transfected cells, inhibited cyclic adenosine 3′5′-monophosphate (cAMP) formation in α2A-transfected cells, and stimulated cAMP formation in β1-transfected cells. Nerve growth factor activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) in all cell lines; however, norepinephrine activated ERKs only in α1A- and β1-transfected cells but not in α2A-transfected cells. Norepinephrine also activated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK in α1A-transfected cells but not in β1- or α2A-transfected cells. Norepinephrine caused differentiation of PC12 cells expressing α1A-ARs but not those expressing β1- or α2A-ARs. However, norepinephrine acted synergistically with nerve growth factor in promoting differentiation of cells expressing β1-ARs. Whereas ERKs are activated by Gi- but not Gs-linked receptors in many fibroblastic cell lines, we observed the opposite in PC12 cells. The results show that activation of the different G protein signaling pathways has different effects on MAPKs and differentiation in PC12 cells, with Gq signaling pathways activating all three major MAPK pathways.

Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). MAPK pathways have been shown to be inhibited by increases in cAMP concentrations in some fibroblastic cell lines (15Cook S.J. McCormick F.

Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). MAPKs are subdivided into three major pathways (17Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). Extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERKs) are stimulated by growth factors and cytokines and stimulate growth and differentiation. The proto-oncogene c-ras and the cytoplasmic kinases c-Raf and MEK are known to play important roles in the activation of ERKs (18Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Williams N.G. Paradis H. Agarwal S. Charest D.L. Pelech S.L. Roberts T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The other two MAPK pathways, c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (also known as stress-activated protein kinase) and p38 MAPK, are generally activated by stresses such as inflammatory cytokines, osmotic shock, or UV irradiation and may be involved in inhibition of cell growth and/or apoptosis. The balance between these pathways may be critical in determining cell fate (21Xia Z. Dickens M. Rangeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of activation of ERKs by GPCRs remain controversial. Responses to Gq-linked receptors are thought to involve both the α- and βγ-subunits of G proteins, although the αq-dependent activation of protein kinase C is thought to play the predominant role (3Crespo P.

Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Similar mechanisms have been implicated in activation of JNK/SAPK by GPCRs (24Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 25Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Dermott J.M. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18655-18659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and GPCR activation of p38 MAPK was recently suggested to involve Gαq- as well as βγ-subunits (26Yamauchi J. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27771-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). βγ-Dependent activation of p38 MAPK is inhibited by coexpression of Gαo in HEK 293 cells (26Yamauchi J. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27771-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PC12 cells, derived from a rat pheochromocytoma, have been a primary model for studying mechanisms underlying neuronal differentiation (27Wood K.W. Roberts T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1155: 133-150Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor (NGF) acts on receptors with tyrosine kinase activity to differentiate these cells into a neuronal phenotype, through a Ras-dependent activation of ERKs (28Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Stimulation of both bradykinin (Gq/11-coupled) and lysophosphatidic acid (Gi-coupled) receptors also activates ERKs in PC12 cells, apparently through the tyrosine kinases Pyk2 (6Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar) and Src (8Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) in a Ras-dependent manner. cAMP analogs also activate ERKs and potentiate NGF-induced neurite formation in PC12 cells (29Frodin M. Peraldi P. van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Gq/11-, Gi-, and Gs-linked receptors may all activate ERKs in this cell line. This raises questions about signaling specificity. If all three types of G proteins can activate ERKs, albeit through different mechanisms, do they have similar functional consequences? To what extent are known second messengers involved in activation of the MAPK pathways? Are the functional consequences of G protein activation similar to those of tyrosine kinase receptor activation? We wanted to directly address the specificity by which GPCRs activate MAPK pathways in a single cell line and study their functional consequences. To do this, we transfected PC12 cells with inducible expression vectors coding for one of each of the three families (α1A, α2A, and β1) of adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes (30Bylund D.B. Eikenberg D.C. Hieble J.P. Langer S.Z. Lefkowitz R.J. Minneman K.P. Molinoff P.B. Ruffolo R.R. Trendelenberg U.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 121-136PubMed Google Scholar, 31Minneman K.P. Esbenshade T.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 117-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to assess whether Gq/11-, Gi-, and Gs-linked pathways all activate ERKs in this cell line. ARs affect growth and differentiation of a variety of cell types, although the mechanisms involved are not yet clear. All ARs are activated by norepinephrine (NE), but they initiate signals through different G proteins. α1-ARs increase PI hydrolysis and intracellular Ca2+ through Gq/11, α2-ARs inhibit adenylate cyclase through Gi, and β-ARs stimulate adenylate cyclase through Gs. We wanted to directly assess which signaling pathways were linked to which MAPK pathways and determine whether activation of any of these GPCRs would cause differentiation of PC12 cells.

PC12 cells were obtained from Cindy Miranti and Michael Greenberg (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). NGF was generously provided by David Ginty (Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD). The full-length AR sequences were cloned into the multiple cloning site of the operator vector (pOPRSVICAT) of the inducible Lac-Switch system. TheNotI fragment of pOPRSVICAT containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was replaced with the multiple cloning site of pBluescript KS+ (where an additional NotI site had been inserted 5′ to the XhoI site) to facilitate insertion of the gene of interest (35Esbenshade T.A. Han C. Murphy T.J. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 76-86PubMed Google Scholar). Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Confluent cells were subcultured in a 1:3 ratio. Where indicated, transfected cells were treated with 1 mmIPTG for various time periods to induce receptor expression. PC12 cells were co-transfected with the LacSwitch repressor (p3′SS) and operator vectors by calcium phosphate precipitation and propagated for several weeks in the presence of 250 μg/ml hygromycin and 500 μg/ml Geneticin to obtain resistant cells. Subclones expressing each of the different ARs were obtained by screening for cell lines that exhibited low constitutive and high inducible receptor levels by radioligand binding. Cells for radioligand binding and second messenger measurements were plated at lower (110) antibiotic concentrations. Confluent 100-mm plates of cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (20 mmNaPO4, 154 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) and harvested by scraping. Cells were homogenized with a Polytron, and membranes collected by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 10 min, washed, and resuspended by homogenization. Receptor density was determined by saturation analysis of specific antagonist radioligands. Binding of [125I]BE 2254 (α1; [125I]BE), [125I]-iodocyanopindolol (β) and [3H]rauwolscine (α2) to membrane preparations was performed as described previously (36Nasseri A. Minneman K.P. Mol.

Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For saturation analysis, increasing concentrations of radioligand ([125I]BE, 25–800 pm; [125I]cyanopindolol, 10–300 pm; [3H]rauwolscine, 200–4000 pm) were used. Nonspecific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 10 μm phentolamine (α1 or α2) or 50 μm isoproterenol (β). Accumulation of [3H]InsPs was determined in confluent 35-mm dishes. Cells were treated with or without 1 mm IPTG for 48 h and labeled withmyo-[3H]inositol (2mCi/plate) for 1–2 days. Production of total [3H]InsPs in the presence of 10 mm LiCl was determined as described previously (35Esbenshade T.A. Han C. Murphy T.J. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 76-86PubMed Google Scholar). Results are expressed as percentage of hydrolysis of [3H]inositol incorporated into lipid. cAMP accumulation was measured by the [3H]adenine prelabeling technique in confluent 35-mm dishes as described previously (37Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1085-1093PubMed Google Scholar). Results are expressed as percent conversion of incorporated [3H]ATP into [3H]cAMP. Confluent cells were serum-starved for 2 h at 37 oC before treatment. Agonists were generally added for 15 min, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. 20 μg of total protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Activation of ERK1 and 2, JNK/SAPK, or p38 MAPK was detected by blotting the membrane with phosphospecific ERK, JNK/SAPK, or p38 MAPK antibodies (New England Biolabs) that specifically recognize the activated, threonine, and tyrosine dually phosphorylated forms. Blots were stripped and probed with nonphosphospecific antibodies to the enzymes to control for protein loading. Proteins were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We used radioligand binding and functional approaches to determine whether any endogenous ARs are expressed in PC12 cells. Low levels of endogenous α2-ARs have been reported in PC12 cells (39Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but we found no detectable levels of any AR subtype in our PC12 cells. No specific binding was detected in membrane preparations using the antagonist radioligands [125I]BE (α1-AR), [3H]rauwolscine (α2 -AR), or [125I]cyanopindolol (β-AR) (<5 fmol/mg of protein, data not shown). There was also no detectable stimulation of cAMP by the β-AR agonist isoproterenol, no inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP by the α2-AR agonist UK 14,304 (see also below), and no stimulation of [3H]InsP formation by the α1-AR agonists phenylephrine or NE in parental PC12 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that this is one of the few cell lines that do not express measurable levels of any AR subtype. PC12 cells were co-transfected with the lac repressor vector and the lac operator vector containing either human α1A-, human α2A-, or rat β1-AR coding sequences. Subclones expressing each receptor were screened for low constitutive expression and inducibility by IPTG. Saturation analysis of specific radioligand binding was used to measure receptor density. Several subclones were isolated with inducible expression of α1A- or α2A-ARs; however, we were unable to obtain subclones showing inducible expression of β1-ARs. Several subclones with constitutive expression of β1-ARs were isolated and used for further studies. Constitutive and IPTG-induced receptor density in selected subclones is summarized in Table I.Table IAdrenergic receptor density and properties in subclones of transfected PC12 cells: effect of IPTG inductionK DB max−IPTG+IPTG−IPTG+IPTGpmfmol/mg of proteinα1A-349 ± 1629 ± 537 ± 16293 ± 65α2A-5706 ± 158925 ± 174124 ± 37902 ± 82β1-350 ± 2537 ± 21209 ± 74195 ± 78PC12 cells were co-transfected with one of the three adrenergic receptor cDNAs subcloned into the LacSwitch operator vector and p3′SS as described in the text. Individual subclones were isolated and propagated as described. Receptor density (B max) and affinity (K D) was quantitated by saturation analysis of radioligand (α1A, [125I]BE 2254; α2A, [3H]rauwolscine; β1, [125I]iodocyanopindolol) binding to membranes from cells treated with (+IPTG) or without (−IPTG) 1 mm IPTG for 48 h.p < 0.001 compared to −IPTG. Open table in a new tab PC12 cells were co-transfected with one of the three adrenergic receptor cDNAs subcloned into the LacSwitch operator vector and p3′SS as described in the text. Individual subclones were isolated and propagated as described. Receptor density (B max) and affinity (K D) was quantitated by saturation analysis of radioligand (α1A, [125I]BE 2254; α2A, [3H]rauwolscine; β1, [125I]iodocyanopindolol) binding to membranes from cells treated with (+IPTG) or without (−IPTG) 1 mm IPTG for 48 h. p < 0.001 compared to −IPTG. Three subclones of PC12 cells expressing α1A-ARs were extensively characterized (Fig. 1). Saturation analysis of [125I]BE binding showed that each subclone exhibited different levels of constitutive and IPTG-induced (1 mm, 48 h) receptor expression, with α1A-3 showing the highest degree of induction. The effect of NE on [3H]InsP formation was studied to ensure that the expressed receptors were functional. Basal [3H]InsP formation was similar in each subclone, and was not affected by treatment with IPTG (Fig. 1). NGF caused small increases in [3H]InsP formation in each subclone, and this response was unaffected by treatment with IPTG. On the other hand, NE increased [3H]InsP formation in each subclone, and this response was substantially increased by induction of receptor expression with IPTG. NE-stimulated [3H]InsP formation was highly correlated with receptor density, being highest in subclone 3, which expressed the highest density of α1A-ARs and lowest in subclone 9, which expressed the lowest density of α1A-ARs (Fig. 1). α1A-AR activation had no effect on cAMP levels (data not shown), showing an absence of cross-talk with Gior GS. Two PC12 subclones showing inducible expression of α2A-AR receptors (α2A-2 and α2A-5) were characterized extensively. Saturation analysis of [3H]rauwolscine binding indicated similar levels of basal and IPTG-induced receptor expression in each cell line. The concentration-response curve for IPTG-stimulation of α2A-AR expression in subclone 5 is shown in Fig. 2. IPTG caused about a 7-fold increase in receptor expression with an EC50 around 5–10 μm. Inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in these cells by the α2-AR-selective agonist UK 14,304 was used to ensure that the expressed receptors were functional. As expected, there was no effect of IPTG-induced receptor expression on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 2). However, the potency of UK 14,304 in inhibiting forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was enhanced 5–7-fold by IPTG pretreatment (1 mm, 48 h). Interestingly, the maximal inhibition of the forskolin response by UK 14,304 was not affected by IPTG, suggesting that the density of α2A-ARs in uninduced cells is sufficient for maximal inhibition. α2A-AR activation did not affect InsP formation (data not shown), showing an absence of cross-talk with Gq/11. All β1-AR-expressing PC12 subclones that we isolated showed constitutive receptor expression. Each subclone showed a receptor density around 200 fmol/mg of protein, which was not significantly altered by treatment with IPTG (1 mm, 48 h). Because this receptor density is in the range of expression of the α1A-AR- and α2A-AR-expressing subclones, we used the constitutive expression of subclone β1-3 to study β1-AR responses in PC12 cells. Because the β-AR is not activated in the absence of ligand, we did not make further attempts to isolate an inducible β-AR PC12 cell line. Stimulation with forskolin (30 μm) caused about a 10-fold increase in cAMP accumulation in both parental PC12 cells and the β1-3 subclone (Fig. 3). Stimulation with the β-AR agonist isoproterenol (10 μm) had no effect on cAMP accumulation in parental PC12 cells but caused a significant 50–100% increase in the β1-3 subclone. UK 14,304 had no effect on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in either parental PC12 cells or in the β1-3 subclone (Fig. 3), confirming the absence of endogenous α2-ARs. β1-AR activation also did not affect InsP formation (data not shown), showing an absence of cross-talk with Gq/11. We studied the effect of NE on ERK activation in PC12 cells expressing the different AR subtypes. Exposure to NGF (100 ng/ml) caused activation of ERK 1 and 2 phosphorylation in parental PC12 cells (Fig. 4), as well as in PC12 cells expressing each of the AR subtypes (α1A-3, α2A-5, and β1-3). Exposure to NE (100 μm) had no effect in parental PC12 cells but caused activation of ERKs in the α1A-3 PC12 cells (Fig. 4). As expected, the degree of activation of ERKs by NE was increased by increasing α1A-AR expression with IPTG. NE also caused ERK activation in β1-3 PC12 cells, although this effect was not increased by IPTG, which does not increase β1-AR expression in these cells. Surprisingly, NE had no effect on ERK activation in α2A-5 PC12 cells, even after increasing receptor density by IPTG exposure (Fig. 4). Blotting for total ERK protein showed equivalent sample loading for each condition (Fig. 4). To confirm the lack of α2A-AR-mediated ERK activation in PC12 cells, the effect of NE was also tested on the α2A-2 subclone. Again, NGF increased ERK phosphorylation in this cell line, whereas NE had no effect either with or without exposure to IPTG (data not shown). Several GPCRs have also b"

Development of the vertebrate hindbrain involves specification of the neural epithelium into lineage-restricted compartments known as rhombomeres (r, r1 to r8 in mouse) (1Fraser S. Keynes R. Lumsden A. Nature. 1990; 344: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 2Lumsden A. Keynes R. Nature. 1989; 337: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Cells within each compartment can mix freely with each other but not with those of adjacent rhombomeres. After rhombomere formation, cells in each compartment acquire specific patterns of neuronal differentiation, axon outgrowth, and neural crest cell migration. Thus, the segmentation of the hindbrain into rhombomeres plays a critical role in generating specific neuronal cell types and regional architecture. Coupled to these morphogenetic events, signaling molecules, receptor tyrosine kinases, and transcription factors regulate multiple aspects of hindbrain development at the molecular level (reviewed in Ref. 3Lumsden A. Krumlauf R. Science. 1996; 274: 1109-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Components of the regulatory networks include Hox homeobox genes and, more recently, the Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, designated ephrins. Hox genes encode homeobox-containing transcription factors that are homologous to Drosophila homeotic genes. During hindbrain development, many members of the Hox gene family exhibit rhombomere-restricted expression patterns. Among the first expressed Hox genes, Hoxa1 and Hoxb1are activated during early gastrulation in the primitive streak; by the head fold stage, their expression domains reach a sharp anterior boundary in the neuroectoderm coinciding with the presumptive r3/r4 border. Whereas Hoxa1 is subsequently down-regulated,Hoxb1 expression becomes restricted to r4 and persists until the disappearance of rhombomere boundaries (4Frohman M.A. Boyle M. Martin G.R.

Genetic analysis of hox mutants revealed that precise anterior domains of Hox expression correlate with their functional roles in the hindbrain (reviewed in Ref. 9Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). r4 is partially deleted in the absence of Hoxa1 but maintains its identity (10Carpenter E.M. Goddard J.M.

Loss of both genes does not further reduce the size of r4 but creates an r4-like territory with unknown identity, suggesting synergistic roles between Hoxa1 and Hoxb1 in rhombomere patterning (14Studer M.

Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)1 belong to a distinct class of RTKs that play important roles in many tissues, including the hindbrain. Structurally, each receptor of this family consists of a single polypeptide chain containing two fibronectin III repeats and a cysteine-rich region in the predicted extracellular domain. To date, at least 14 members of the Eph receptor family and a family of 8 ligands have been identified. Ligands of Eph family receptors are structurally related membrane-bound proteins that can be subdivided into two major subclasses (16Gale, N. W., Holland, S. J., Valenzuela, D. M., Flenniken, A., Pan, L., Ryan, T. E., Henkemeyer, M., Strebhardt, K., Hirai, H., Wilkinson, D. G., Pawson, T., and Yancopoulos, G. D. (1996) 17, 9–19Google Scholar), ephrin-A and ephrin-B. Ligands in the ephrin-A subclass, including the prototype family member ephrin-A1 (B61), are membrane associated through glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkages, whereas ephrin-B subclass consists of ligands with transmembrane domains. During hindbrain patterning, Eph receptors and their ligands exhibit complementary rhombomere-restricted expression patterns: Eph receptors EphA4 (Sek-1) (17Nieto M.A. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Charnay P. Wilkinson D.G. Development. 1992; 116: 1137-1150PubMed Google Scholar) and EphA2 (Eck/Sek-2) (18Becker N. Seitanidou T. Murphy P. Mattei M. Topilko P. Nieto M.A. Wilkinson D.G. Charnay P.

All the ephrin ligands examined to date, Ephrin-B1 (Elk-L), Ephrin-B2 (Elf-2), and Ephrin-B3 (Elk-L3), are expressed in r2, r4, and r6 (22Flenniken A.M. Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Wilkinson D.G. Dev.

However, mice carrying null mutations in individual Eph receptor genes seem to have normal hindbrain development (21Chen J. Nachabah A. Scherer C. Ganju P. Reith A. Bronson R. Ruley R.

Robertson, personal communication. probably reflecting functional redundancy among the Eph family signaling pathways. Clues to the role of Eph receptors in the developing hindbrain came from the study of dominant negative EphA4 (sek-1) receptors. Injection of RNA encoding truncated EphA4 receptor into zebrafish and Xenopus embryos results in failure to establish sharp rhombomere boundaries (24Xu Q. Alldus G. Holder N. Wilkinson D.G. Development. 1995; 121: 4005-4016PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that EphA4 and its ligands restrict cell intermingling between odd- and even-numbered rhombomeres. These findings are consistent with a general role of the Eph family in mediating repulsive cell-cell interaction, as suggested by studies of axonal guidance (25Cheng H. Nakamoto M. Bergemann A.D. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1995; 82: 371-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 26Drescher U. Kremoser C. Handwerker C. Loschinger J. Noda M. Bonhoeffer F.

The ordered and nested expression patterns of Eph receptors and their ligands along the neuraxis raise questions how these restricted domains of expression are achieved. The segment-restricted expression patterns of Eph receptors are reminiscent of those of Hox genes, which are expressed at similar developmental stages, raising the possibility of regulatory interactions. For example, likeHoxa1 and Hoxb1, EphA2 is expressed in the primitive streak during gastrulation and becomes restricted to prospective r4 during the head fold stage. At the 4–8 somite stage,EphA2 expression coincides with that of Hoxb1 in r4 and is subsequently down-regulated before Hoxb1 (19Ganju P. Shigemoto K. Brennan J. Entwistle A. Reith A.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1613-1624PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ruiz J.C. Robertson E.J. Mech. Dev. 1994; 46: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Chen J. Nachabah A. Scherer C. Ganju P. Reith A. Bronson R. Ruley R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to extensive studies on Hox gene regulation, relatively little is known about the regulation of Eph receptors in the hindbrain. As a first step toward understanding the coupling between cell-cell interaction and transcriptional control in the hindbrain, we undertook an analysis of the regulatory elements of the murineEphA2 gene. Here, we report the identification of an enhancer element that drives EphA2 expression in r4 and show that human HOXA1 and HOXB1 can activate reporter gene expression through this enhancer element. These data suggest a direct mechanism for control of EphA2 expression by the HOX paralogy group 1. A 12-kb genomic DNA fragment (construct 1) upstream of the EphA2 gene was originally isolated from sequences surrounding an inserted U3βgeo (lacZ-neo) gene trap retrovirus (21Chen J. Nachabah A. Scherer C. Ganju P. Reith A. Bronson R. Ruley R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar). For constructs 2–7, genomic DNA fragments isolated from EphA2 genomic clones were ligated into the SmaI site of ASShsplacZpA cassette (gift of Sasaki and Hogan (32Sasaki H. Hogan B.L. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)). Both strands of the 1.8-kb SmaI fragment (construct 5) were sequenced following cycle sequencing with fluorescent dideoxy chain terminators and analyzed on an ABI 377 DNA sequencer. NotI fragments containing the transgene expression cassette were isolated from agarose gels by the Gelase protocol (33Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). DNA concentration was measured by either agarose gel electrophoresis or fluorometry. Transgenic embryos were produced by pronuclear injection as described (33Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Briefly, 6-week-old (C57BL/6 × DBA/2) F1 female mice were superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU of gonadotropin from pregnant mare serum 48 h prior to injection of 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin. Female mice were then mated with (C57BL/6 × DBA/2) F1 male mice. The pronuclei of fertilized eggs were microinjected with transgene DNA at a concentration of 3–6 ng/μl. Injected eggs were transferred to pseudopregnant recipient ICR mice. The genotype of embryos was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a lacZ sequence. Primers used were 5′-TTGCCGTCTGAATTTGACCTG and 5′-TCTGCTTCAATCTGCGTGCC. β-Galactosidase activity in dissected embryos was detected as described previously (21Chen J. Nachabah A. Scherer C. Ganju P. Reith A. Bronson R. Ruley R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos at day 8.5 postcoital (day of vaginal plug or retransfer was designated as day 0.5) were dissected away from extraembryonic tissues and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 30 min. The embryos were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 4 °C and stained at 37 °C overnight in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% SDS, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, and 1 mg/ml X-Gal. Pbx and HOX proteins were produced in vitro from the corresponding pCDNA3-derived expression vectors using a T7 polymerase-based coupled transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. HOX and Pbx proteins were translated separately in the presence of [35S]methionine and normalized for the methionine content of each protein. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed by pre-incubating 2–4 μl of in vitro synthesized protein for 30 min on ice in 15 μl of binding buffer (75 mm NaCl, 6% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA), together with 2 μl (0.5 ng, 5 × 104 cpm) of32P-labeled oligonucleotides. The incubation mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis on a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE at 10 V/cm. Gels were dried and exposed at −70 °C. Oligonucleotides used (only one strand shown) are as follows: repeat B, 5′-GGAAGGAAGGGTGGATGGATGGGTGTACAGA; repeat C, 5′-AGACAGATGGATGGATGGGC; repeat D, 5′-TGGATAGATGGATGGATGGG; repeat E, 5′-TTGCATGATGGATGGGCTGG; mutant repeat E, 5′-TTGCATGTCGACTGGGCTGG; and Hoxb-1 r4 enhancer repeat 3, 5′-GATCCGGGGGGTGATGGATGGGCGCTGGGA. COS7 and P19 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum or fetal bovine serum, respectively. COS7 cells were transfected by the standard DEAE-dextran method. In a typical transfection experiment, 8 μg of reporter construct, 4–8 μg of expression construct, and 0.4 μg of pCH110-β-gal as an internal control were used per 10-cm dish. P19 cells were transfected by LipofectAmine (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent in a 6-well dish. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. The expression of EphA2 during hindbrain patterning is very dynamic (19Ganju P. Shigemoto K. Brennan J. Entwistle A. Reith A.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1613-1624PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ruiz J.C.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, EphA2 is detected at the head fold stage in a narrow band corresponding to presumptive r4. As somitogenesis begins, EphA2 expression becomes restricted to the presumptive r4, which includes both dorsal neural ectoderm and the floor plate. By the 10-somite stage, EphA2 expression is down-regulated. In addition to its hindbrain expression, transcripts of EphA2 become restricted in the node during gastrulation. To define upstream signaling pathways and transcriptional events that control this dynamic expression pattern of EphA2, we mapped regulatory elements of the EphA2 gene in transgenic embryos. Our prior studies (21Chen J. Nachabah A. Scherer C. Ganju P. Reith A. Bronson R. Ruley R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that integration of a gene trap provirus in the 5′ end of the EphA2 gene disrupted the expression of the EphA2 protein. Moreover, the expression of the reporter gene carried by the provirus recapitulated the endogenousEphA2 expression between 6.5 and 10.5 days of embryonic development (21Chen J. Nachabah A. Scherer C. Ganju P. Reith A. Bronson R. Ruley R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that tissue-specific regulatory elements responsible for EphA2 gene expression might be in the regions flanking the provirus. To test this possibility, a 12-kb genomic DNA insert containing a single 4-kb provirus LTR and 8-kb flanking cellular DNA (Fig. 1 A, construct 1) was isolated from a genomic DNA library constructed fromepha2 i (eck i )heterozygous mice (21Chen J. Nachabah A. Scherer C. Ganju P. Reith A. Bronson R. Ruley R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar). This 12-kb genomic DNA fragment carries a promoterless LacZ-neo fusion gene in the U3 region of the pro-viral LTR (viral enhancer deleted (34Scherer C.A. Chen J. Nachabeh A. Hopkins N. Ruley H.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1393-1401PubMed Google Scholar)) and was microinjected to generate transgenic embryos. As shown in Fig. 1 B (construct 1), the spatial and temporal patterns of lacZ expression in transgenic embryos largely coincided with that of the endogenousEphA2 gene (19Ganju P. Shigemoto K. Brennan J. Entwistle A. Reith A.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1613-1624PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ruiz J.C. Robertson E.J. Mech. Dev. 1994; 46: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Chen J. Nachabah A. Scherer C. Ganju P. Reith A. Bronson R. Ruley R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar). LacZ expression was detected in the node during gastrulation in E7.5 embryos (Fig. 1 B, left panel) and in the presumptive r4 in E8.5 embryos (Fig. 1 B, right panel). In E9.5 embryos,lacZ expression was down-regulated in r4 and regressed toward tail bud (data not shown). In the node, lacZ expression was only seen in some cells (data not shown), indicating that additional elements are required to recapitulate complete node expression of EphA2. Taken together, these results suggest that the 8-kbEphA2 genomic DNA flanking the provirus is sufficient to direct r4-specific expression of EphA2 gene during early embryogenesis. To further define cis-actingEphA2 regulatory elements, an 8-kb BglII fragment was isolated from a wild-type EphA2 genomic clone. Judging by restriction mapping, this 8-kb fragment is identical to the 12-kb fragment except that it does not contain the 4-kb viral LTR. Restriction fragments were isolated from the 8-kb BglII genomic DNA, placed upstream of an hsp68promoter-lacZ-poly(A) cassette (32Sasaki H. Hogan B.L. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and tested for enhancer activity in transgenic embryos at E7.5 to E8.5, stages where EphA2 is expressed in presumptive r4. With such an enhancer assay, patterns and levels of gene expression may vary between transgenic embryos, depending on the integration site of the transgene. Therefore, only reproducible expression patterns reflecting enhancer activity of the test fragment were scored. Expression from the proximal 3.8-kb XhoI-BglII fragment (Fig. 2, construct 4) was similar to the original 12-kb fragment, i.e. expression in the rhombomere and spotty expression in the node. In contrast, the distal 5.2-kb XhoI-XhoI fragment (Fig. 2, construct 2) and the 4.5-kb BglII-XhoI fragment (Fig. 2, construct 3) gave only variable ectopic staining. Because the hsp68promoter-lacZ-poly(A) cassette is devoid of any enhancer sequences and, on its own, does not give a reproducible expression pattern in transgenic embryos (data not shown, see Ref. 32Sasaki H. Hogan B.L. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), these data indicate that the proximal 3.8-kb XhoI-BglII fragment (construct 4) contains sufficient enhancer activity to confer rhombomere-specific expression to a heterologous promoter and that the distal 5.2-kb XhoI-XhoI fragment (construct 2) and the 4.5-kb BglII-XhoI fragment (construct 3) do not contain any essential regulatory elements for expression in these domains. The 3.8-kb XhoI-BglII fragment was further divided into several fragments. Of these, a 1.8-kbSmaI fragment (Fig. 2, construct 5) recapitulated the expression pattern of the original 12-kb fragment, whereas the 1.5-kbSmaI-BglII fragment (Fig. 2, construct 6) gave only ectopic staining in embryos. Further division of the 1.8-kb fragment revealed that the 0.9-kb SacI-SmaI fragment (Fig. 2, construct 7) retained rhombomere-specific staining but did not give node staining. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the 0.9-kb SacI-SmaI fragment contains the rhombomere-specific enhancer and that enhancers for the rhombomere and the node reside in separate DNA elements. Localization of the EphA2 r4 enhancer element to a sequence of 0.9 kb enabled us to search for potential transcription factors that might mediate enhancer activity. As a first step, to examine whether any of the known transcription factor binding sites are present in the EphA2 enhancer regions, the 1.8-kbSmaI fragment (construct 5) was sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that the 1.8-kb SmaI fragment contained many potential transcription factor binding sites, including the Hox-Pbx consensus binding repeat identified in the Hoxb1 r4 autoregulatory element (ARE) (35Popperl H. Bienz M. Studer M. Chan S.K. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Mann R.S. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). However, most binding sites are present in both r4-specific enhancer element (3′ half of the 1.8-kb fragment, construct 7) and nonspecific genomic DNA (5′ half of the 1.8-kb fragment). In contrast, five Hox-Pbx binding sites were found in the 0.9-kb r4-specific enhancer element (Fig. 3), whereas no such sites were present in the 5′ half of the 1.8-kb fragment. Because the up-regulation of EphA2 in r4 is very similar to the early expression patterns of Hoxa1 and Hoxb1 in the hindbrain, we focused our studies on the Hox-Pbx binding sites. These Hox-Pbx binding sites, 5′-(T/A)GAT(T/G)GA(T/A)G-3′, were shown to bind specifically to Hoxb1/Pbx1 and Hoxa1/Pbx1 complexes (35Popperl H. Bienz M. Studer M. Chan S.K. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Mann R.S. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 36Rocco D.G. Fulvio M. Zappavigna V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3644-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, theHoxb1 r4 ARE contains three such sites (repeat 1 to repeat 3), which are necessary and sufficient to drive r4-specific expression in transgenic embryos (35Popperl H. Bienz M. Studer M. Chan S.K. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Mann R.S. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). These putative Hox-Pbx binding sites in theEphA2 enhancer have been named repeat A to repeat E. Four of these repeats are clustered in the 3′ end of the enhancer, whereas repeat A is located more centrally. All of the repeats share identical core nucleotides (bold in Fig. 3), with repeat D containing two overlapping repeats. These results, together with the similarity of expression patterns for EphA2, Hoxa1, and Hoxb1, raise the question whether transcriptional activation of EphA2 is directly regulated by Hoxb1 and/or its paralog Hoxa1. To investigate the possible involvement of Hoxa1 and Hoxb1 in mediating EphA2 enhancer activity, we tested the ability of HOXA1 and HOXB1 proteins to bind to a series of oligonucleotides, each of them spanning one repeat motif. Prior studies showed that specific interactions between Hox proteins and their target sequences require Pbx cofactors (35Popperl H. Bienz M. Studer M. Chan S.K. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Mann R.S. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 36Rocco D.G. Fulvio M. Zappavigna V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3644-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 37Mann R.S. Chan S.-K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Therefore,in vitro translated Pbx1, HOXA1, and HOXB1 proteins were used in EMSAs. As repeats B, C, D, and E are clustered in the 3′ portion of the enhancer, we tested whether these four repeats can bind to HOXA1/Pbx1 or HOXB1/Pbx1 in vitro. The ability of HOX/Pbx protein to bind to repeats B–E (lanes 3–10) was also compared with binding to repeat 3 of the Hoxb-1 r4 ARE (lanes 1 and 2) (35Popperl H. Bienz M. Studer M. Chan S.K. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Mann R.S. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A (lanes 3–10), HOXA1/Pbx1 and HOXB1/Pbx1 complexes can bind to all four repeats, although apparently with different affinities. Repeat E showed the strongest binding to HOX/Pbx1 complexes (lanes 9 and 10), which is comparable with the binding of repeat 3 in the Hoxb1 r4 ARE (lanes 1 and 2). A close examination of these repeat sequences revealed that although all four repeats are identical in their core sequence 5′-GATGGA-3′, repeat E in EphA2 enhancer and repeat 3 in Hoxb1 ARE carried a nucleotide T flanking the 5′-G, which might contribute to the tighter binding of these repeats to HOX/Pbx complexes. EMSAs were also used to test whether cooperative interactions between HOXA1 or HOXB1 and Pbx1 are essential for binding to repeat E from theEphA2 enhancer region. As shown in Fig. 4 B, HOXA1 and HOXB1 alone did not bind to repeat E (lanes 2 and 3), whereas Pbx-1 alone bound only weakly (lane 4). However, under the same conditions, efficient binding was observed when Pbx1 was present together with either HOX protein (lanes 5 and 8). This binding was specific, as the complexes were competed by an excess of unlabeled normal (lanes 6 and 9) but not mutant (lanes 7 and 10) oligonucleotides containing repeat E. Similar results were obtained with repeat B and with Hoxb1 r4 ARE repeat 3 (data not shown; specific and cooperative binding to repeats C and D was not tested). These results showed that potential Hox-Pbx binding sites within the EphA2 enhancer can specifically bind to HOXA1/Pbx1 or HOXB1/Pbx1 proteins in vitro. In light of our binding results, the ability of the HOX/Pbx complexes to transactivate reporter gene expression through the EphA2 enhancer was tested in transient cotransfection experiments. Because the hsp68promoter-lacZ-poly(A) cassette gives rise to high background activity in cell lines, we subcloned a 200-base pair fragment (EphA2-r42B, Fig. 5 A) containing repeats B to E from the EphA2 enhancer into pML, a luciferase reporter vector that exhibits minimal background activity in both COS7 and P19 cells (36Rocco D.G. Fulvio M. Zappavigna V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3644-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). pML-ARE, a luciferase reporter under the control of the Hoxb-1 r4 ARE, was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 5 B, cotransfection of HOXA1 and Pbx1, or HOXB1 and Pbx1, with the pML-EphA2-r42B reporter led to significant transactivation of the reporter activity in COS7 cells, whereas cotransfection of pcDNA3 control expression vector with pML-EphA2-r42B reporter gave only background activity. This level of transactivation of pML-EphA2-r42B by HOX/Pbx proteins is comparable with that of the pML-ARE positive control reporter. Transactivation of pML-EphA2-r42B reporter activity by HOX/Pbx proteins was also observed in a different cell type, i.e. the murine embryonal carcinoma P19 cell line (Fig. 5 C). These data suggest that HOXA1 or HOXB1 in conjunction with Pbx1 protein can work in trans to activate enhancer-dependent expression of theEphA2 gene. Despite extensive investigation of the transcriptional regulation of Hox genes during hindbrain development, relatively few studies (38Theil T. Frain M. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Flenniken A. Charnay P. Development. 1998; 125: 443-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Taneja R. Thisse B. Rijli F. Thisse C. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have addressed rhombomere-specific expression of Eph receptors. Here, we report that an 8.0-kb genomic fragment 5′ of theEphA2 coding region directs reporter gene expression to r4 of transgenic mouse embryos. Further analysis showed that a 0.9-kb fragment within the region can recapitulate this r4-specific expression pattern. This activity is independent of the orientation of the 0.9-kb fragment, suggesting that it contains a transcriptional enhancer. r4-specific expression of the EphA2 gene is reminiscent of Hoxb1 and its paralog Hoxa1, raising the possibility that EphA2 expression is regulated by Hox genes. Here, we show that 1) the 0.9-kb enhancer of EphA2 contains multiple binding sites for HOXA1/Pbx1 and HOXB1/Pbx1 proteins, 2) oligonucleotides spanning the binding sites bind to these proteinsin vitro, and 3) co-expression of HOXA1 and Pbx1 or HOXB1 and Pbx1 proteins transactivates reporter gene expression from the EphA2-r42B enhancer. These results are consistent with recent genetic studies in which EphA2 expression is substantially decreased in hoxa1/hoxb1 double null mutant mice, although an r4-like territory with unknown identity is present in the mutant (14Studer M. Gavalas A. Marshall H. Ariza-McNaughton L. Rijli F.M. Chambon P. Krumlauf R. Development. 1998; 125: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Gavalas A. Studer M. Lumsden A. Rijli F. Krumlauf R. Chambon P. Development. 1998; 125: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3M. Rossel and M. Capecchi, personal communication. Taken together, these data suggest that expression of EphA2 in r4 is, at least in part, directly regulated by Hoxa1 and Hoxb1. r4 enhancer activity was first detected in sequences surrounding a U3βgeo gene trap retrovirus inserted into the EphA2gene. Although the provirus inserted over 8 kb upstream of the 5′ end of the previously published EphA2 cDNA sequence, the provirus completely abolished EphA2 protein expression, and expression of the inserted lacZ reporter recapitulated expression of the endogenous EphA2 gene (21Chen J. Nachabah A. Scherer C. Ganju P. Reith A. Bronson R. Ruley R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar). These studies illustrate the utility of gene entrapment as a mean to identify functional elements involved in tissue-specific gene regulation. Although our evidence suggests a direct role of Hoxa1/Hoxb1 in regulating EphA2 expression,Hoxa1/Hoxb1 alone may not be sufficient to account for the complete dynamic temporal and spatial restricted expression pattern of EphA2 gene in r4 (19Ganju P. Shigemoto K. Brennan J. Entwistle A. Reith A.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1613-1624PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ruiz J.C. Robertson E.J. Mech. Dev. 1994; 46: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Chen J. Nachabah A. Scherer C. Ganju P. Reith A. Bronson R. Ruley R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar). For example, EphA2expression is substantially reduced, but not abolished, in thehoxa1/hoxb1 double null mutant, suggesting the existence of additional factors regulating residual EphA2 expression. Furthermore, EphA2 expression is down-regulated in r4 by embryonic day E8.75, whereas Hoxb-1 expression persists until at least E10.5 (8Murphy P. Hill R. Development. 1991; 111: 61-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these findings suggest the existence of specific transcriptional factors, further studies will be required to identify such additional factors regulating EphA2expression in r4. Members of the Eph receptor family are known to mediate repulsive cell-cell interactions in axonal guidance during neural development (27Nakamoto M. Cheng H. Friedman G.C. McLaughlin T. Hansen M.J.

Cell. 1996; 86: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Because of their segmental-restricted expression patterns in the hindbrain, this ligand/receptor family is likely to restrict cell intermingling between odd- and even-numbered rhombomeres. Experimental evidence to support this hypothesis came from a study involving truncated EphA4 receptors, in which injection of RNA encoding a dominant negative EphA4 into zebrafish and Xenopus embryos interfered with the establishment of sharp rhombomere boundaries (24Xu Q. Alldus G. Holder N. Wilkinson D.G. Development. 1995; 121: 4005-4016PubMed Google Scholar). The role of EphA2 in hindbrain is less clear. Mutant mice carrying mutations generated either by retroviral insertion (21Chen J. Nachabah A. Scherer C. Ganju P. Reith A. Bronson R. Ruley R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 979-988PubMed Google Scholar) or by gene targeting2 seem to have normal hindbrain development, probably reflecting functional compensation by other receptors in the Eph family. The identification and characterization of thisEphA2 r4 enhancer element permit targeting the expression of trans-dominant inhibitors of Eph receptor, e.g. dominant negative receptors or receptor-Ig, to be expressed at the endogenous locus in transgenic mice, allowing functional characterization of EphA2 during hindbrain development.

These enzymes are physically associated with cytokine receptor components. Here, we sought to define the molecular basis of the interaction between Tyk2 and IFNAR1, a component of the interferon α/β receptor, by delimiting a minimal IFNAR1 binding region in the Tyk2 protein. Using an in vitro assay system, we narrowed down the interaction domain to a region comprising the JH7 and part of the JH6 homology boxes (amino acids 22–221). When expressed in Tyk2-negative cells, the JH7-6 region was unable to stabilize IFNAR1 protein levels, a critical function that we previously attributed to the N region (amino acids 1–591) of Tyk2. Moreover, substitution of the JH7-JH6 domain in JAK1 with that of Tyk2 did not restore IFNAR1 level nor interferon α signaling in Tyk2-negative cells. Thus, the major interaction surface lies within JH7-6, but additional JH regions (JH5-4-3) contribute in a specific manner to the in vivo assembly of Tyk2 and IFNAR1. Evidence is also provided of the lack of specificity of the Tyk2 kinase-like and tyrosine kinase domains in interferon α/β receptor signaling.

The Janus kinase (JAK)1family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases consists of four mammalian proteins (Tyk2, JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3) that play a critical role in initiating signaling cascades of a large number of cytokine receptors (1Ihle J.N.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 615-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). All JAK proteins possess a carboxyl-terminal tyrosine kinase (TK) catalytic domain, a central kinase-like (KL) domain, and a large amino-terminal (N) region, which has been subdivided into five JAK homology regions (JH7 to JH3) based on sequence conservation (3Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 207-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The specific and noncovalent association of these kinases to the intracellular region of cytokine receptors governs their activation upon ligand binding (2Pellegrini S. Dusanter-Fourt I. Eur. J.

We are interested in understanding the mode of action and specific roles of Tyk2, which is activated, together with another JAK family member, by the type I interferons (IFN) (several α and one β subtypes), by interleukin (IL) 6, IL-10, and IL-12 (4Velazquez L.

The IFN-α/β receptor is present at low numbers on the surface of all cell types and consists of two transmembrane proteins called IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (10Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I.

The IFNAR2 gene generates several alternatively spliced forms, but only the product harboring a long intracytoplasmic domain (IFNAR2c) is part of a functional IFN-α/β receptor (12Lutfalla G.

Whereas the stoichiometry and spatial organization of these components within the receptor complex are unknown, the epitopes on the IFN molecule contacting IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are being identified (13Uzé G.

High affinity binding of IFN-α/β to the receptor results in tyrosine phosphorylation and enzymatic activation of the associated JAK1 and Tyk2 in a defined temporal order, which is thought to result from the topology of each kinase within the complex (14Gauzzi M.C.

Each function appears to be contributed by a different domain adding more complexity to the receptor-kinase complex. The N region, previously defined as the amino-terminal 591 residues and comprising the JH7 to JH3 regions (Fig. 2), maintains the steady-state level of the IFNAR1 protein in the cell. The kinase-like domain contributes to the formation of high affinity receptor binding sites, and the tyrosine kinase domain is essential for optimal binding and signaling function (14Gauzzi M.C.

That Tyk2 interacts physically with IFNAR1 was suggested by co-immunoprecipitation of the two endogenous proteins from cell extracts and by retention of baculovirus-expressed Tyk2 by a fusion protein bearing the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR1 (20Colamonici O.

It was shown that the 45 membrane-proximal amino acids of IFNAR1 were necessary and sufficient for this interaction and that Ala substitution of three critical residues (Ile-Ile-Glu) disrupted this interaction (22Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because in vivo co-immunoprecipitation studies in reconstituted Tyk2-negative cells are hampered by the modulation of IFNAR1 level by Tyk2 itself (19Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uzé G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11839-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), an in vitro system was used here to identify the molecular determinant(s) of Tyk2 which govern its interaction with IFNAR1. Using carboxyl- and amino-terminal deletion mutants of N, we delimited a region including JH7 and part of JH6 that is sufficient to bind recombinant IFNAR1. However, this region alone could not sustain IFNAR1 in Tyk2-negative cells, showing a requirement for additional JH boxes (JH5-4-3). Thus, to address the specificity, if any, of this additional region, a number of Tyk2/JAK1 chimeric constructs were generated. Of four chimeras bearing different JH domains of Tyk2 fused to JAK1, only one could rescue IFNAR1 protein levels and IFN-α signaling. This functional chimera contains the entire N region of Tyk2 fused to the KL and TK domains of JAK1. These results will be discussed in the light of recent reports on other JAK/receptor pairs. All constructs were made in pQE-based expression vectors (Qiagen). To generate plasmid pHis-N-(1–451), an SphI fragment was released from plasmid bs-Tyk2 (human Tyk2 cDNA in pBluescript) and cloned into pQE10. pHis-N-(1–451) encodes p53 (Fig. 2) containing the amino-terminal sequence Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-(His)6-Thr-Asp-Pro-Arg fused to Tyk2 amino acids 1–451 and the carboxyl-terminal Arg-Arg-Pro-Ala-Ala-Lys-Leu-Asn sequence. pHis-N-(1–591) was obtained by inserting a 140-base pair SacII/EcoRI fragment spanning amino acids 452–591 into theSacII-HindIII blunt-ended pHis-N-(1–451) DNA. pHis-N-(1–591) encodes p69 (Fig. 2) with the (His)6sequence (see above) fused to Tyk2 amino acids 1–591 and the carboxyl-terminal Ile-Glu-Leu-Ala sequence. pHis-N-(1–385), pHis-N-(1–369), pHis-N-(1–314), and pHis-N-(1–220) were generated by digesting pHis-N-(1–451) with PstI and eitherPmlI, SacII, DraIII, orNaeI, blunting the ends and re-circularizing each product. Due to the cloning procedure, the resulting proteins contain between 3 and 5 extra carboxyl-terminal amino acids. The three amino-terminal deletion mutants were derived from pHis-N-(1–385) (p46 in Fig. 2). A fragment encoding amino acids 22–385 of Tyk2 was amplified by PCR using primers with appropriate restriction sites and was ligated intoBamHI-SphI-digested pHis-N-(1–385) to generate pHis-N-(22–385). The resulting protein (Δ21 in Fig. 2) contains the amino-terminal His sequence (see above) fused to Tyk2 amino acids 22–385 and to Ala-Lys-Leu-Asn. pHis-N-(1–385) was digested withStuI and HindIII, the resulting 1.1-kb fragment was ligated to the HincII-HindIII-digested pQE10 vector to generate pHis-N-(28–385). The resulting protein (Δ27 in Fig. 2) contains the amino-terminal His sequence fused to Tyk2 amino acids 28–385 of Tyk2 and Ala-Lys-Leu-Asn. pHis-N-(1–385) was digested with PvuII and HindIII, and the resulting 1-kb fragment was ligated to theHincII-HindIII-digested pQE11 vector to generate pHis-N-(54–385). The protein (Δ53 in Fig. 2) contains the amino-terminal His sequence fused to Tyk2 amino acids 54–385 and Ala-Lys-Leu-Asn. The cytoplasmic domain of the human IFNAR1 (amino acids 458 to 557) cloned into the bacterial pGEX-2T expression vector was provided by L. Ling (Biogen Inc., Boston, MA). The Ile-Ile-Glu → Ala-Ala-Ala mutant (amino acids 504–506) was obtained by two-step PCR-mediated mutagenesis. The GST-IkB β chain construct was a gift from R. Weil. All final expression vectors were cloned into the pRc/CMVneo vector (Invitrogen). To generate Δ1–21, a SalI fragment of bs-Tyk2 was substituted with a SalI PCR fragment spanning Tyk2 amino acids 22–170. The plasmid Δ1–51 has been described elsewhere (19Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uzé G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11839-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Full-length human JAK1 cDNA (a gift of A. Wilks) was cloned into bs (bs-JAK1), and an oligonucleotide encoding an epitope of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) was added at the 3′ end. bs-T-(1–62)-J encodes amino acids 1–62 of Tyk2 fused to amino acids 55–1142 of JAK1. It was generated by amplifying a fragment spanning Tyk2 amino acids 1–62 with a NotI site at the 5′ end and aSphI site at the 3′ end and ligating it intoNotI-SphI-digested bs-JAK1. bs-T-(1–275)-J encodes Tyk2 amino acids 1–275 fused to amino acids 275–1142 of JAK1. It was generated by amplifying a fragment spanning amino acids 1–275 of Tyk2 fused to amino acids 275–502 of JAK1, to which aNotI site was added at the 5′ end and which included a single RsrII site at the 3′ end. The resulting NotI-RsrII fragment was ligated to NotI-RsrII-digested bs-JAK1. bs-T-(1–518)-J encodes Tyk2 amino acids 1–518 fused to JAK1 amino acids 500–1142. It was generated by digesting bs-T-(1–275)-J withRsrII and partially with XhoI and ligating it to an XhoI-RsrII PCR fragment spanning amino acids 271–502 of Tyk2. bs-T-(1–581)-J encodes Tyk2 amino acids 1–581 fused to amino acids 564–1142 of JAK1. It was generated by digesting bs-T-(1–518)-J with SphI and NsiI and ligating it with a SphI-NsiI-digested PCR fragment encoding amino acids 496–581 of Tyk2 fused to amino acids 564–761 of JAK1. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for PCRs are available upon request. All chimeric constructs contain 20 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated Tyk2 sequences and the VSV-G epitope at the 3′ end. After sequencing (370A DNA Sequencer, Applied Biosystems), all resulting cDNAs were introduced into the pRc/CMV vector. Histidine-tagged proteins were expressed in bacteria, purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) agarose beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen), eluted, and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 10 mmglutathione, and stored at −80 °C. Approximately 10 to 100 pmol of each freshly purified recombinant protein were incubated in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min at 4 °C in a total volume of 1 ml. Fifty μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads as a 50% slurry were added. Beads were pelleted and washed four times in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5 m NaCl. Bound proteins were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Coomassie staining or immunoblotting with the appropriate antibody. Whenever Ni2+-NTA agarose beads were used, binding was performed in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm imidazole. The mutant cell line 11,1 (also called U1A) has been described (16Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 250 μg/ml hygromycin. Calcium-phosphate/DNA transfection and selection in G418 (450 μg/ml) was performed as described (18Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol.

Cell survival in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (HAT) or in 6-thioguanine (6TG) containing media was assayed in the presence of different concentrations of IFN-α2 (human recombinant IFN-α2b, kindly provided by D. Gewert, Wellcome). Binding experiments with125I-IFN-α2c were performed as described (19Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uzé G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11839-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The GST mAb used in Western blot was kindly provided by Hybridolab (Institut Pasteur). The histidine-tag mAb was purchased (Dianova). Tyk2 antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (R5 and T10–2) have been described (19Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uzé G.

The anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 mAb was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The VSV-tag mAb was purchased from Sigma. Preparation of cell extracts, immunoprecipitations, and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (14Gauzzi M.C. Velazquez L. McKendry R. Mogensen K.E. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20494-20500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). An in vitro interaction assay was set up to identify an IFNAR1 binding domain within the first 591 amino acids (the N region) of Tyk2. Histidine-tagged N was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as a 69-kDa protein (p69) on Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads. The cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR1 was expressed as GST fusion protein (GST-IFNAR1cyt) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The two proteins were co-incubated, and the complex retained on Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. GST-IFNAR1cyt was retained on beads in the presence, but not in the absence, of p69 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 3). In subsequent experiments, proteins retained on beads were analyzed by Western blotting with the Tyk2 or the GST mAbs. In Fig. 1 B, p69 was incubated with either the GST-IFNAR1cyt protein, a mutated version of it in which residues 504 to 506 (Ile-Ile-Glu) were replaced by alanines (22Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), or with a control fusion protein (GST-IkBβ). The material retained on glutathione-Sepharose beads was analyzed with Tyk2 mAb. p69 bound to GST-IFNAR1cyt and to a much lesser extent to the mutated version, albeit it did not bind to GST-IkBβ (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–3). To confirm this interaction, the reverse experiment was performed, where Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads were used to pull down the complex and the GST mAb was used for blotting: GST-IFNAR1cyt was able to interact with p69, but not with a control His-MxA protein (Fig. 1 C). Taken together, these results show that the N region of Tyk2 interacts specifically with the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR1in vitro. This interaction is impaired by alanine substitution of three IFNAR1 residues that were previously shown to be critical for optimal Tyk2 binding (22Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To initially delimit an IFNAR1 binding domain within N, five carboxyl-terminal truncated versions of His-N were generated and named according to their apparent molecular weights (Fig. 2). Each protein was tested for its ability to bind GST-IFNAR1cyt. A glutathione-Sepharose-based interaction assay was performed, and the bound material was analyzed by Western blotting with the Tyk2 mAb or, for the three shorter versions, lacking the Tyk2 epitope, with a commercial His-tag mAb (Fig. 3). All five carboxyl-terminal deleted versions of p69 retained the ability to interact with GST-IFNAR1cyt (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11), whereas they did not interact with the control GST-IkBβ fusion protein (Fig. 3,lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). This result was confirmed upon using the Ni2+-NTA resin-based assay (Fig. 4 A). Thus, the amino-terminal 221 residues of N, comprising JH7 and part of JH6, retain the ability to interact with IFNAR1cyt.Figure 4Ability of amino-terminal deleted forms of His-N to bind GST-IFNAR1cyt. A, the indicated His-tagged proteins were incubated with the wild-type (IFNAR1) or the mutated (IIE → AAA) version of GST-IFNAR1cyt. Proteins retained on nickel beads were analyzed by Western blot with GST antibody.B, the indicated His-tagged proteins were incubated with GST-IFNAR1cyt. Proteins retained on glutathione-Sepharose were analyzed by Western blotting with the Tyk2 mAb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To delimit the amino-terminal boundary of this binding domain, three amino-terminal deletions were generated from the p46 protein, lacking 21, 27, and 53 amino acids, respectively (Δ21, Δ27, and Δ53 in Fig. 2). The purified proteins were tested for their ability to interact with the wild-type or the mutant GST-IFNAR1cyt in pull-down experiments using either of the two resins. Δ27 and Δ53 did not interact with GST-IFNAR1cyt (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and 7 and Fig. 4 B, lane 2), whereas, as shown above, p46 and p27 bound specifically to wild-type GST-IFNAR1cyt (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 3). On the other hand, the Δ21 fusion protein retained IFNAR1 binding capacity (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). These results demonstrate that the first 21 amino acids are dispensable for the in vitro binding of N to IFNAR1 and that the binding domain boundary is situated between residues 22 and 28. To correlate the in vitro binding results (Fig. 4) with the function of the native protein in cells, we stably expressed in Tyk2-negative cells a mutant form derived from the full-length Tyk2 and lacking amino acids 1–21 (Δ1–21). Two independent neor transfectants were studied. As a measure of in vivo Tyk2 function, we first analyzed the levels of endogenous IFNAR1. The Δ1–21 clones were compared with WT cells expressing wild-type Tyk2, to Δ1–51 cells expressing a Tyk2 deleted of residues 1–51 (19Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uzé G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11839-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and to 11,1 cells. As can be seen in Fig. 5 A, unlike Δ1–51, expression of Δ1–21 restored IFNAR1. In light of the differentin vitro IFNAR1cyt interaction capacity of Δ21 and Δ53, this result is likely to reflect the different ability of the two deletion mutants to physically interact with IFNAR1 in vivo. We also measured the IFN-α binding activity of Δ1–21 expressing cells, using WT and 11,1 cells as controls. As shown in Fig. 5 B, iodinated IFN-α2 bound similarly to WT and to Δ1–21 expressing cells, whereas it did not bind to 11,1 cells or to Δ1–51 expressing cells (see also Fig. 5 in Ref. 19Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uzé G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11839-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no difference in the sensitivity to IFN-α could be measured between the Δ1–21 clones and WT cells upon testing their phenotype in HAT or 6TG media (18Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the amino-terminal 21 residues of Tyk2 are dispensable not only for the in vitro binding of N to IFNAR1 but also for the in vivostructural and signaling functions of Tyk2 through the IFN-α/β receptor. The recombinant p27 protein, lacking JH5-4-3, was as effective as full-length p69 in complexing with IFNAR1 in vitro (Figs. 3and 4 B). On the other hand, previous work showed that deletion of JH4 and JH3 abrogated the ability of N to sustain endogenous IFNAR1 in 11,1 cells (Fig. 4 in Ref. 19Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uzé G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11839-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results indicate that the JH5-4-3 segment plays an essential function in the in vivo assembly of Tyk2 with IFNAR1. We therefore addressed the question of the specificity of this segment by generating chimeric constructs in which amino-terminal portions of Tyk2 were swapped into JAK1 (Fig. 6 A). In each chimera, the fusion was made within a stretch of identical residues so as to maintain the integrity of highly conserved regions (see “Materials and Methods”). Wild-type Tyk2, wild-type JAK1, and the four chimeras were independently transfected into 11,1 cells. The level of exogenous protein was measured in neor clones by Western blotting with an antibody specific for the carboxyl-terminal VSV-G epitope tag present in each construct (data not shown). Clones expressing comparable levels of exogenous protein were chosen, and their level of IFNAR1 was analyzed. As can be seen in Fig. 6 B, only in cells expressing wild-type Tyk2 or the T-(1–581)-J chimera was the level of IFNAR1 restored. Particularly significant is the lack of IFNAR1 rescuing by the T-(1–518)-J chimera which bears not only the JH7-6 interaction domain defined in vitro, but also the Tyk2 JH5-4 segment. These results demonstrate that the JH regions of JAK1 cannot functionally substitute for the corresponding JH regions of Tyk2 and that regions besides JH7-6 are required for the in vivo interaction of Tyk2 with IFNAR1. Having shown that the T-(1–581)-J chimera was competent in restoring IFNAR1, we assessed the function of the receptor-kinase complex in these cells by studying activation and signaling. The basal and IFN-α-induced phosphorylation levels of the T-(1–518)-J and T-(1–581)-J chimeras were compared. Two clones expressing the same chimera were studied and, as they behaved identically, results are shown for one. The T-(1–581)-J chimera, but not the T-(1–518)-J, was inducibly phosphorylated to a level comparable with Tyk2 in WT cells (Fig. 7 A, upper panel). Basal phosphorylation of both chimeras was detectable upon longer blot exposure (data not shown). In parallel, immunoprecipitations with antibodies specific for the JAK1 TK domain were performed to analyze the phosphorylation level of the endogenous JAK1 protein in these cells. As expected, the JAK1 antibodies reacted with the chimeric constructs as well (Fig. 7 B, lower panel). Induced phosphorylation of endogenous JAK1 was comparable in cells expressing wild-type Tyk2 or the T-(1–581)-J chimera, whereas no activation occurred in cells expressing the T-(1–518)-J chimera (Fig. 7 B, upper panel). The IFN-α sensitivity of T-(1–581)-J-expressing cells was measured in media containing HAT or 6TG and IFN-α and was found to be comparable with WT cells (data not shown). The antiviral response against vesicular stomatitis virus was also assayed. With WT cells and two clones expressing the T-(1–581)-J chimera, the dose range for antiviral protection was between 100 pm and 1 pm IFN-α2. Conversely, with T-(1–518)-J and 11,1 cells no protection was observed with up to 100 nm IFN-α2. Thus, a chimera bearing the N region of Tyk2 and the KL and TK domains of JAK1 can fully replace wild-type Tyk2 in the IFN-α pathway. In this study, two approaches were used to delimit the minimal region within the tyrosine kinase Tyk2 that is required to interact with the IFNAR1 component of the IFN-α/β receptor complex. Anin vitro approach for testing the interaction of the two recombinant partners narrowed down the IFNAR1cyt interaction domain to Tyk2 amino acids 1–221, spanning the homology region JH7 and part of JH6. The amino-terminal boundary of the domain was mapped between amino acids 21 and 27. We could not delimit more accurately the carboxyl-terminal boundary of the domain because the expression level of a shorter construct (amino acids 1–172) dropped considerably. The physiological relevance of this in vitro analysis is supported by the finding that in 11,1 cells, a mutant form of Tyk2 lacking amino acids 1–21 was as functional as the wild-type protein,i.e. it restored IFNAR1 levels, ligand binding, induced gene expression, and antiviral protection. In contrast, further deletion to amino acid 51 abolished all functions. Alignment and close inspection of the amino-terminal end of the JAK family members revealed some interesting features (Fig. 8) that may explain the different properties of the deletion mutants. The first portion (20–25 residues) of this segment is variable in length, displays low identity, and lacks conserved secondary structures. Starting around Tyk2 position 28, however, approximately at the amino boundary of the JH7 region (3Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 207-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), predicted secondary structures common to the different family members can be found (Fig. 8). The result of our analysis of amino-terminal deletion mutants together with this prediction suggest that these structural elements are critical for the function and/or stability of the domain. Recent studies of other JAK proteins have similarly suggested the existence of a JH7-6 structural element within the first 200 residues that would constitute a specific interaction surface for cytokine receptor chains (2Pellegrini S. Dusanter-Fourt I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 615-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 23Zhao Y. Wagner F. Franck S.J. Kraft A.S. J. Biol.

Functional analysis of JAK2 deletion mutants or of JAK2/JAK1 chimeras, expressed in JAK2-negative cells, showed that the first 251 residues of JAK2, spanning JH7-6, were specifically required for the interaction with the R2 subunit of the IFN-γ receptor (25Kohlhuber F. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Feng J. Guschin D. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B.A. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Studies of the interaction of the γc chain of the IL-2, -4, -7, -9, and -15 receptors with deleted forms of JAK3 expressed in COS cells narrowed down the domain of interaction to JH7-6 (JAK3 residues 1–192) as well (26Chen M. Cheng A. Chen Y.-Q. Hymel A. Hanson E.P. Kimmel L. Minami Y. Taniguchi T. Changelian P.S. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6910-6915Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This JH7-6 region alone was not tested in a more physiological system, although the same authors did show that a chimera containing JH7-6-5 and part of JH4 of JAK3 (residues 1–370) fused with JAK2 could restore IL-2 signaling in JAK3-negative cells stably reconstituted with the αβγ components of the IL-2 receptor. On the other hand, structure-function analysis of JAK1 in the context of the IFN-γ receptor showed that the entire amino-terminal region (JH7-JH3), fused to the kinase domains of JAK2, was required for the interaction with the R1 subunit of the IFN-γ receptor in JAK1-negative cells (25Kohlhuber F. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Feng J. Guschin D. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B.A. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In this system, the level of the γR1 receptor protein was independent from the presence of the interacting JAK1. Thus, it appears that the requirements for JH regions other than JH7-6 vary in different receptor/JAK systems and this may relate to the variation in the affinities of the interaction between given partners. In the present study, we show that, despite its ability to associate with IFNAR1 in vitro, the JH7-6 domain of Tyk2 is not sufficient to rescue IFNAR1 levels when tested in Tyk2-negative cells, indicating a critical requirement for the JH5-4-3 regions for this function. Moreover, our analysis of the Tyk2/JAK1 chimeras (Fig. 6) clearly showed that these regions from JAK1 could not functionally replace the Tyk2 ones, indicating strict specificity. These results suggest that JH5-3 is involved in the IFNAR1 stabilizing function. The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown (19Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uzé G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11839-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and no other examples of such phenomenon have been described to date. We cannot exclude the possibility that the JH5-3 region augments the affinity of the interaction of the JH7-6 binding domain with IFNAR1 or that it interacts with another component of the receptor complex. Whatever the mechanism, this contribution would be negligible in the in vitro system and become critical in the cellular environment. A study was recently reported on the IFNAR1 binding region of Tyk2 (27Yan H. Piazza F. Krishnan K. Pine R. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4046-4051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) which showed, in accordance with our in vivo data, that an intact N region was required for maximal binding to IFNAR1. This group also used lysates from bacteria expressing GST-Tyk2 fusions to pull down a CD4-IFNAR1 chimera transfected into 293T cells and proposed the existence of two weak binding sites centered around the JH6 and the JH3 boxes, respectively. We have no evidence of such weak interaction domains, and this discrepancy could be due to the different stringencies of the two experimental approaches. More sensitive methods will be required to define the relative contribution, if any, of independent JH boxes. Our analysis of the chimeric Tyk2/JAK1 proteins also provides some clues about the specificity of the KL and the TK domains. Full restoration of function (gene induction and antiviral protection) by the T-(1–581)-J chimera demonstrates the interchangeability of these domains for Tyk2 function in cellular responses to IFN-α. Similar conclusions were reached for a JAK1/JAK2 chimera in the IFN-γ response (25Kohlhuber F. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Feng J. Guschin D. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B.A. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although the function of the KL domain is not yet known, we have previously shown that, in Tyk2, it contributes to the ligand binding activity of the receptor (18Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 19Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uzé G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11839-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Given the rescuing capacity of the T-(1–581)-J chimera, which contains the KL domain of JAK1, we conclude that this function of KL is not Tyk2-specific. IFN-α/β-induced activation of the JAKs is thought to involve trans-phosphorylation of regulatory tyrosine(s) located in the activation loop of the TK domain. This event takes place in a specific temporal order (JAK1 → Tyk2) with JAK1 playing the prominent role (14Gauzzi M.C. Velazquez L. McKendry R. Mogensen K.E. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20494-20500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Briscoe J. Rogers N.C. Witthuhn B.A. Watling D. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We previously proposed that this order may relate more to spatial constraints and stoichiometry of the receptor-kinase complex than to properties intrinsic to each kinase. Our present finding that endogenous JAK1 appears phosphorylated equally well when juxtaposed to the T-(1–581)-J chimera or to Tyk2 (Fig. 7 B) provides further evidence of the lack of specificity of these kinases. To fully demonstrate this, it will be necessary to investigate whether the reciprocal chimera, bearing the N region from JAK1 fused to the kinase domains of Tyk2, can restore IFN-α responses in JAK1-negative cells. In this regard, it has been reported that a chimera bearing the N region of JAK1 fused to the kinase domains of JAK2 can sustain substantial though incomplete IFN-α-induced gene expression and antiviral protection to EMC virus (25Kohlhuber F. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Feng J. Guschin D. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B.A. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Whether other biological responses to IFN-α, not measurable in our system, could specifically require Tyk2 kinase domains cannot be ruled out. The analysis of the IFNAR1/Tyk2 pair points to a variant,i.e. the expression level and the intrinsic stability of endogenous cytokine receptor subunit, which could be critical for some receptor-kinase complexes and/or in some cell types. It will be interesting to investigate whether the Tyk2 domains defined here for the assembly with IFNAR1 overlap with those involved in the interaction with other Tyk2-activating cytokine receptors, such as the IL-12 or the IL-10 receptors (28Kotenko S.V.

Similarly, it remains to be seen whether any specificity in the function of the kinase domains of Tyk2 could be revealed through the study of these two other receptor-kinase complexes. We thank M. C.

https://openalex.org/W2088793065,"Binding of chromosomal high mobility group 1 protein (HMG1) to UV-damaged DNA has been studied with oligonucleotides containing a single dipyrimidine site for formation of UV photolesions. Irradiation of an oligonucleotide with unique TT dinucleotide resulted in generation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer with no evidence for induction of (6-4) photoproducts, whereas the analysis of irradiated TC-containing oligonucleotide detected (6-4) photoproducts but not cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Mobility shift assays have revealed that HMG1 protein binds preferentially to irradiated TT and TC oligonucleotides. Photoreversal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers with DNA photolyase and hydrolysis of the (6-4) photoproducts with hot alkali substantially reduced but did not eliminate binding of HMG1. The protein, therefore, appears to bind the two main types of UV damages in DNA, but some other photolesion(s) contributes to the preferential binding of HMG1 to irradiated DNA. By quantifying gel shift assays and considering the efficiencies of lesion formation, we determined dissociation constants of 1.2 ± 0.5 and 4.0 ± 1.5 μm for irradiated TT and TC oligonucleotides, respectively, and 70 ± 20 μm for the control non-irradiated probes. Tryptic removal of the acidic COOH-terminal domain of HMG1 significantly affected binding of the protein to both irradiated and intact oligonucleotides.

High mobility group proteins 1 and 2 (HMG1 and -2)1 are abundant chromosomal proteins found in a variety of eukaryotic species. Despite their early identification and biochemical characterization (1Johns E.W. The HMG Chromosomal Proteins. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar) and subsequent implication in a number of cellular events, their functions are still unknown (for reviews see Refs. 2Bustin M. Lehn D.A. Landsman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar and 3Landsman D. Bustin M. BioEssay. 1993; 15: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The interest in these proteins sharply increased in the early 1990s with the discovery of a new kind of eukaryotic protein domain involved in interactions with DNA (4Jantzen H.-M. Admon H. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Nature. 1990; 344: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), which displayed sequence similarity to two homologous repeats of an 80-amino acid sequence in HMG1. This motif called HMG box was found in a wealth of less abundant eukaryotic proteins, mainly general transcription factors and gene-specific transcriptional activators (reviewed in Refs. 3Landsman D. Bustin M. BioEssay. 1993; 15: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and 5Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). A general characteristic of these proteins is their ability to bind bent DNA or to induce bending in DNA independent of sequence or the existence of prebent regions (6Lilley D.M.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 282-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, HMG1 binds preferentially to distorted DNA sites such as synthetic cruciform DNA structures (7Bianchi M.E. Bertrame M. Paonessa G. Science. 1989; 243: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 8Bianchi M.E. Falciola L. Ferrari S. Lilley D.M.J.

The ability of HMG box-containing proteins to mediate bending in linear duplex DNA was demonstrated by several approaches (11Giese K. Cox J. Grosschedl R. Cell. 1992; 69: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 12Pil P.M. Chow C.H. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, these proteins can constrain negative supercoils in plasmid DNA (14Sheflin L.G. Fucile N.W. Spaulding S.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3238-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Stros M. Storkova J. Thomas J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1264-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The finding that HMG1 binds more tightly to cisplatin-damaged DNA than to unmodified B form DNA implies that the signal for the binding specificity is a particular DNA structure. The major cisplatin adducts formed in vivo are d(GpG) and d(ApG) 1,2-intrastrand cross-links (20Fichtinger-Schepman A.M.J. van der Veer J.L. den Hartog J.H.J. Lohman P.H.M. Reedijk J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar), which were shown to bend the helix by 32–34o and to unwind it by 13o (21Bellon S.F. Coleman J.H. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8026-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Both bending and unwinding of DNA is believed to be the specific structure recognized by HMG1 (9Pil P.M. Lippard S.J. Science. 1992; 256: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). It was intriguing to investigate the binding activity of this protein to structural changes in DNA induced by other agents known to distort the helix (see the commentary in Ref. 6Lilley D.M.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 282-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Some literature data make the UV light a likely candidate for such an agent. Thus, the major photoproduct produced in DNA by the short wavelength UV light, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), was found to induce both bending (22Husain I. Griffith J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2558-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23Wang C.-I. Taylor J.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and unwinding (24Ciarocchi G. Pedrini A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) of DNA. Furthermore, the second major UV-induced lesion in DNA, the pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts or (6-4) photoproduct was recently reported to produce bending in DNA (25Kim J.-K. Choi B.-S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The present study addresses this question by studying the binding activity of HMG1 to oligonucleotides containing a single dipyrimidine site for induction of the two major photolesions upon irradiation with UV light. We show that HMG1 prefers to bind to irradiated oligonucleotides and the binding is enhanced upon removal of the COOH-terminal tail of the protein. Nuclei from Guerin ascites tumor cells and from calf thymus were used to isolate HMG1,2 proteins by the nondenaturing salt extraction procedure described elsewhere (26Marekov L.N. Demirov D.G. Beltchev B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 789: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After DEAE-cellulose chromatography, the fractions containing HMG1 were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mmNaCl, 5 mm DTT and stored at −70 °C in aliquots. Removal of the COOH-terminal domain of HMG1 was carried out by mild digestion with trypsin (Sigma, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated). Both cleavage of HMG1 and the purification of the major tryptic fragment termed HMG3 (15Stros M. Storkova J. Thomas J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were performed as described (27Stros M. Vorlickova M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1990; 12: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The final HMG3 preparation was dialyzed and stored as for HMG1. The purity of the proteins was assessed by electrophoresis in SDS-18% polyacrylamide gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in this study were designed as described previously (29van Assendelft G.B. Rigney E.M. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3399-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and synthesized on a Gene Assembler Plus DNA Synthesizer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the phosphoramidite method. The adjacent pyrimidines are underlined (see below). 5′ ACG CAT GCA TGC ATT¯ GCG CGC GTA TA3′ TGC GTA CGT ACG TAA CGC GCG CAT AT (TT oligo) 5′ ACG CAT GCA TGC ATC¯ GCG CGC GTA TA3′ TGC GTA CGT ACG TAG CGC GCG CAT AT (TC oligo) 5′ ACG CAT GCA TGC ATG CGC GCG TAT A3′ TGC GTA CGT ACG TAC GCG CGC ATA T (No adjacent pyrimidines) The two complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides were32P-end-labeled by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [γ-32P]dATP. After removal of kinase and unincorporated radiolabel, each labeled strand was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in a hybridization buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2). Equimolar amounts of the complementary strands were pooled, heated at 68 °C for 5 min, and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotide was resolved on native 15% polyacrylamide gel at 12 °C. On completion of electrophoresis the gel was briefly exposed to x-ray film, and the bands corresponding to full-length double-stranded oligonucleotide were excised. The resulting gel slices were soaked for several hours in 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C under agitation. The eluted DNA was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of glycogen (Stratagene), centrifuged, and dried in a Speedvac. The pellet was dissolved in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl to a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Double-stranded oligonucleotides in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl were spotted on parafilm and irradiated on ice with light from a germicidal lamp (primarily 254 nm) at 7J/m2/s. Formation of CPD was quantified by treatment of irradiated oligonucleotides with phage T4 endonuclease V that nicks DNA specifically near the site of the dimer (30Gordon L.K. Haseltine W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 12047-12050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 10-μl assay containing 1 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg of BSA, and endonuclease V (diluted 1:50 and added in amounts that carry the reaction to completion, as determined in a separate experiment) was kept 30 min at 37 °C and dried in a Speedvac for 10 min. The content of the tube was dissolved in 10 μl of 50% formamide, 0.025% xylene cyanole and layered onto a denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea at 56 °C. On completion of electrophoresis the gel was fixed and dried, and the bands obtained were quantitatively evaluated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using Image Quant software. Formation of (6-4) photoproducts was assayed by treatment of irradiated oligonucleotides with 0.1 m NaOH at 90 °C for 30 min before cooling on ice for 5 min and subsequent neutralization with HCl (31Lippke J.A. Gordon L.K. Brash D.E. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3388-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic separation and the quantitative analysis of the alkali-labile products were performed as above. Irradiated TT oligonucleotide was treated with photolyase from Escherichia coli (kindly gifted by Prof. Aziz Sancar together with instructions for use) in a 100-μl assay, containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 5 μl of BSA (mg/ml), and photolyase (0.1 mg per 1 mg of DNA). The solution was irradiated at 366-nm light from a monochromator for 10 min at 15 °C, deproteinized by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and oligonucleotides were recovered by precipitation with ethanol. Successful removal of CPD was monitored with T4 endonuclease V as described above. Radiolabeled oligonucleotide (33 ng/ml) was incubated for 20 min at 20 °C with HMG1 in a 30-μl assay containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol. Non-labeled sonicated salmon sperm DNA (3.3 μg/ml) was used as competitor where indicated. This makes 100-fold excess by weight, but taking into account that not more than 5% of irradiated TT oligonucleotides contained CPD (see “Results”), the real excess of non-damaged DNA sequences relative to the CPD-containing oligonucleotides was about 2000 times. In the case of irradiated TC oligonucleotide with 16–18% (6-4) photoproduct formation at the fluences used, the excess is about three times less. The mixture was loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide 29:1) in 0.5× TBE buffer. Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature in 0.5× TBE at a constant voltage (10 V/cm), following a pre-run for at least 3 h. A sample of gel tracking dye was run in a separate lane to monitor the migration. On completion of electrophoresis the gel was fixed in 7% acetic acid for 5 min, dried under vacuum onto Whatman paper, and autoradiography performed at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Samples (5 μg of HMG1 protein) were resolved on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) electrophoretically at 4 °C for 1 h at 8 V/cm in a buffer containing 25 mmTris, pH 8.2, 192 mm glycine, 15% methanol. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1% gelatin, 0.5% BSA in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). They were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with affinity purified anti-HMG1 antibody in TBST buffer supplemented with 0.5% BSA, washed three times in TBST, and further incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked antibody (1:3000). The bands were visualized by using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified HMG1 was resolved on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters as described above. The membranes were soaked in 6 mguanidine HCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. The blots were washed successively for 20 min in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA containing decreasing concentrations of guanidine HCl (3.0, 1.5, 0.75, and 0.3m), followed by two washings for 10 min in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mmEDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol. The membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 5% non-fat dry milk and hybridized overnight in the same buffer to either irradiated or non-irradiated 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (106 cpm/ml) in the presence of salmon sperm DNA. The membranes were washed four times for 30 min at room temperature with the above buffer without dry milk and three times with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and exposed to x-ray film for 24 h. Since the EMSA revealed a single retarded band, the dissociation constants were determined assuming 1 to 1 equilibria between free oligonucleotide O, free protein P, and the retarded complex PO. For non-irradiated TT and TC probes, EMSA data yielded the ratio p = (PO)/(O), where (PO) and (O) indicate the concentration of the corresponding species and, accordingly, K d=(P)/p. As the total protein concentration (PT) was much higher than the concentration of the total labeled probe,K d ≅ (PT)/p. Irradiated probes, however, were considered as binary mixtures consisting of a fractionf of lesion containing probes O′ (dissociation constantK d′) and a fraction (1 − f) of intact oligonucleotide molecules O (dissociation constantK d). The experimentally determined ratio isp′ = (PO) + (PO′)/(O)+(O′). Considering equilibria and mass conservation equations and assuming (P) ≅ (PT), this expression rearranges to yield K d′ = PT(1 − c)/(p′ +c), where c = (1 −f)(p′ − p)/f(1 +p). In these equations p and p′ indicate ratios determined with irradiated and non-irradiated oligonucleotides at one and the same PT. For the irradiated probes the values of f were 6.5 and 17.5%, respectively. These figures were 20–30% higher than the amount of generated CPD and (6-4) products in order to take into account the contribution of other photolesions (see “Results and Discussion”). The main products formed in DNA by the UV light are CPD and the (6-4) photoproducts. In this work we used oligonucleotides containing either a single TT (TT oligonucleotide) or a single TC (TC oligonucleotide), the sites for preferential formation of CPD or (6-4) photoproducts, respectively (32Friedberg E.C.

Since the DNA lesion frequency can vary by almost an order of magnitude according to the flanking sequences (33Umlas M.E. Franklin W.A. Chan G.L. Haseltine W.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1985; 42: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,35Bourre F. Renault G. Seawell P.C. Sarasin A.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 1-272Google Scholar), our first task was to determine the portion of the adjacent pyrimidines that has been converted to the above photoproducts upon irradiation of the oligonucleotides. Following irradiation, the oligonucleotides were treated with phage T4 endonuclease V under the conditions of enzyme excess such that increased amounts of enzyme did not lead to increased strand scission. On completion of digestion the oligonucleotides were resolved by electrophoresis in denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1). Since both TT and TC oligonucleotides contain a single site for dimer formation which is located on a constant position along the sequence of both oligonucleotides, the localization of the dimer was very easy (Fig. 1, lanes 2–4). The frequency of scission at this unique site was determined by the ratio of the radioactivity in the bands produced by the enzyme and the total radioactivity on the gel. Fig. 1 reveals also that breaks are not apparent in irradiated DNA which has not been exposed to enzyme (Fig. 1, lane 1). It is noteworthy that endonuclease V does not cleave irradiated TC oligonucleotide (Fig. 1,lanes 5 and 6), i.e. under the conditions of irradiation the single TC is not converted into CPD. The quantitative analysis of the digestion pattern in Fig. 1 showed that the dimerization of TT oligonucleotide did not exceed 5% of the sites containing adjacent thymines. Finally, irradiation led to the appearance of bands with higher molecular weight than that of the original single-stranded oligonucleotide. Since the material extracted from these bands migrated on a native gel as did the unirradiated double-stranded oligonucleotide (not shown), these bands were attributed to interstrand cross-links. The formation of (6-4) photoproducts was quantified by hot alkali treatment of TT and TC oligonucleotides. The breakage of the 3′-pyrimidine of the potential dimer site (34Franklin W.A. Lo K.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13533-13543Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) is clearly seen upon treatment of irradiated TC oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, lane 2). For the experiment presented in the figure, 18% of the CT sites have been converted into alkali-labile products. However, the treatment of irradiated TT oligonucleotide showed no detectable presence of alkali-labile products (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). Such a result is not surprising in light of the observations that alkali-labile lesions could be induced at TT sites in human DNA but at a frequency 1/10th that measured for TC sites (34Franklin W.A. Lo K.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13533-13543Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Induction of CPD and (6-4) photoproducts as a function of the dose of irradiation was assayed by treatment with endonuclease V and hot alkali, respectively, and the results are presented in Fig. 3. The dose-response curves for the two lesions markedly differed. CPD in TT oligonucleotide accumulated rapidly up to a plateau level (5%) at fluences higher than 2 kJ/m2 (Fig. 3 A). Such a kinetics of CPD formation is attributed to photoreversal of CPD. In contrast, (6-4) photoproducts in TC oligonucleotide continued to accumulate upon increasing the fluences up to the values we have used (55 kJ/m2, Fig. 3 B). The ability of HMG1 to bind UV-damaged DNA was studied with oligonucleotides containing a single potential site for the formation of one of the two major UV light-induced lesions, CPD or (6-4) photoproducts. Irradiated and unirradiated probes were incubated with HMG1, and the specificity of the complex formation was analyzed by EMSA and by Southwestern blotting. The results obtained with EMSA are presented in Fig. 4. The incubation of a constant amount of non-irradiated TT oligonucleotide with increasing quantities of HMG1 shows that at a given concentration of HMG1 the protein shifts the oligonucleotide, the band shift increasing upon further increase of the amount of HMG1 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–5). However, when HMG1 was incubated with irradiated TT oligonucleotide, the band shift appeared at a protein concentration lower than that shifting the non-irradiated TT (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6–9). Similar results were obtained with irradiated and non-irradiated TC oligonucleotide. Thus, a concentration of HMG1 could be selected at which the protein binds to irradiated TT and TC oligonucleotides but not to non-irradiated ones, and this is well illustrated in Fig. 4 B (lanes 2–5). In fact, the difference in the binding ability of HMG1 to damaged and intact oligonucleotides shown in Fig. 4 A is much more demonstrative taking into account the efficiency of lesion formation (see above). Thus, among the irradiated TT oligonucleotides only 1 of 20 molecules contains CPD upon irradiation at doses higher than 2.5 kJ/m2 (see Fig. 3 A). The remaining molecules are not damaged and compete with lesion containing oligonucleotides for binding to HMG1. For quantification, a constant amount of the oligonucleotide (either intact or irradiated) was incubated with several different concentrations of HMG1, and the radioactivity of shifted complex and unshifted oligonucleotide were determined from quantitative analyses of gels on a PhosphorImager. Based on these data we determined dissociation constants K d′ of 1.2 ± 0.5 and 4.0 ± 1.5 μm for the interaction of HMG1 protein with the irradiated TT and TC oligonucleotides, respectively (see “Materials and Methods”). It should be stressed that when calculating K d′, we took into account the experiments with photoreactivated TT probe and hot alkali-treated TC probe, which suggest a contribution of photolesions other than CPD and (6-4) photoproducts (see below). Dissociation constantK d of 70 ± 20 μm was measured for binding to control non-irradiated probe. This value is close to that previously reported for nonspecific binding of HMG1 to DNA (12Pil P.M. Chow C.H. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9465-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Binding of HMG1 to single-stranded TT and TC oligonucleotides was also analyzed. No band shift has been registered with either intact or irradiated strands (Fig. 4 B, lanes 8 and 9). This was confirmed by EMSA competition experiments in which the incubation assay containing labeled double-stranded TT oligonucleotide was supplemented with increasing amounts of unlabeled TT chain. It was found that 1600-fold molar excess of the unlabeled competitor did not affect the band shift (not shown). This observation disagrees with the earlier reports for a preferential binding of HMG1 to single-stranded DNA than to double-stranded DNA. One explanation for this discrepancy might be the size of DNA. The preference of HMG1 to single-stranded DNA binding has been shown with nicked circular PM2 DNA (37Javaherian K. Sadeghi M. Liu L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 11: 3569-3580Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), salmon DNA (38Isackson P.J. Fishback J.L. Bidney D.L. Reek G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5569-5572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and poly(dA) homopolymer (39Butler A.P. Mardian J.K.W. Olins D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10613-10620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); we have worked with short 26-base single-stranded oligonucleotides. Furthermore, the role of the ionic strength could not be ruled out (38Isackson P.J. Fishback J.L. Bidney D.L. Reek G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5569-5572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The electrophoresis of the purified HMG1 did not reveal proteins other than HMG1, but trace amounts of undetected proteins cannot be excluded. To prove that the band shift is due to HMG1, anti-HMG1 antibody was added to the incubation mixture. In this experiment band shift was not observed, whereas the addition of non-immune immunoglobulin was without effect (Fig. 5). The affinity of HMG1 to UV-damaged DNA was assayed also by Southwestern blotting. 32P-Labeled intact and irradiated TT oligonucleotides were reacted with blotted HMG1 and autoradiographed (Fig. 6). A band was observed only on the Southwestern blot with irradiated oligonucleotide, which coincided with the band revealed on the Western blot. The same result was obtained using TC oligonucleotides (not shown) Besides the two main photoproducts, UV light induces some minor lesions such as the thymine glycol, the interstrand cross-links that appear to be far less efficiently induced than the main photoproducts (36Cadet J. Vigny P. Morrison H. Bioorganic Photochemistry. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 1-272Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that the exposure of DNA in aqueous solution to UV radiation at relatively low doses caused formation of several monomeric base damage products (40Doetsch P.W. Zastawny T.H. Martin A.M. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As seen in Figs. 1 and 2, irradiation has induced interstrand cross-links, whose amounts increased upon increasing the dose of irradiation. In our case the frequency of interstrand cross-linking was close to that observed for CPD formation in the irradiated TT oligonucleotide. The contribution of the minor lesions was controlled by using an oligonucleotide with generally the same sequence as TT and TC oligonucleotides but without adjacent pyrimidines as unique potential site for dimerization. In a binding assay with this control oligonucleotide HMG1 did not show a binding preference to irradiated probes (Fig. 4 B, lanes 6and 7). It turned out, however, that this oligonucleotide was not a proper control for the interstrand cross-links, because in denaturing gel irradiated TT, TC, and control oligonucleotides showed different pattern of cross-linking (Fig. 3 A, inset). To determine the contribution of CPD and (6-4) photoproducts to the preferential binding of HMG1 to UV-irradiated oligonucleotides, we made use of enzymatic photoreactivation to s"

Since bicarbonate is known to be a substrate for pyruvate carboxylase, and it is also nonpermeable to the mitochondrial membrane, we assume that its role is to provide bicarbonate for pyruvate carboxylase in pancreatic islets. Double immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analyses of alpha and beta cells purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) allowed us to identify the beta cell as the islet cell type in which CA-V is expressed.These findings led us to examine the effect of acetazolamide, a widely used CA inhibitor, on glucose-stimulated insulin release by isolated rat islets. Strong inhibition was observed, suggesting that at least one of the CA isoenzymes may be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion. Since CA-V is the only CA we could identify in beta cells, we concluded that CA-V plays some role in the regulation of insulin secretion.RESULTSFig. 1 shows the immunoperoxidase staining of CA-V in tissue sections of rat (panel A) and mouse (panel B) pancreases. In both species, the enzyme was predominantly expressed in islets of Langerhans. Only a weak immunoreactivity was found in the exocrine pancreas. The CA-V-positive cells represented a majority of the islet cells and were centrally located inside an individual islet. The high magnification view in Fig. 1 B (inset) indicates that the immunoreaction for CA-V is granular, showing a typical mitochondrion-like staining pattern. Control immunostaining using normal rabbit serum showed no positive reaction in mouse islets (Fig. 1 C). Fig. 2 shows confocal laser scanning microscopy images of the immunofluorescence reaction for CA-V in a mouse islet (panel A) and an isolated rat islet cell (panel B). The positive reaction was clearly granular, suggesting that the enzyme is located in the mitochondria of these cells.Figure 2Confocal laser scanning images of CA-V in a mouse pancreatic islet (A) and in an isolated rat islet cell (B) show granular immunoreaction.

Treatment of rat islets with 100 μm acetazolamide results in an ∼80% inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The inhibitory effects of acetazolamide on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were similar in magnitude to the inhibitory actions of the cytokine IL-1, which results in a complete inhibition of insulin secretion (Fig. 5). These findings provide experimental evidence to support a role for carbonic anhydrase in the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by isolated rat islets.Figure 5Effects of acetazolamide on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by rat islets. Rat islets, treated with 100 μm acetazolamide or 1 unit/ml IL-1, were isolated, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was examined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments containing three to four replicates/condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have used immunocytochemistry and Western blotting to demonstrate the expression of mitochondrial CA-V in the endocrine pancreas. Immunohistochemical staining of rat and mouse pancreases showed granular mitochondrion-like positive reaction in islet cells. The large number of CA-V-positive cells in each islet and their central distribution suggested that the enzyme is located in beta cells. Indeed, double immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections and isolated islet cells for CA-V and insulin showed that CA-V is expressed in pancreatic beta cells. The specificity of the localization was confirmed using Western blotting, which revealed that islets and FACS-purified beta cells express the 33-kDa precursor and 30-kDa mature forms of CA-V, whereas no signal was detected in alpha cells. The high level of expression of mitochondrial CA-V in pancreatic beta cells and very little or no expression in other pancreatic cell types suggest that CA-V has a highly cell-specific function in mitochondria of beta cells, presumably related to their specific metabolic needs for mitochondrial bicarbonate.Among the many factors capable of stimulating insulin secretion in beta cells, glucose is physiologically the most important. Mitochondrial oxidation of glucose, resulting in the production of ATP, is required for insulin secretion (26Hedeskov C.J. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 442-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We show here that selective inhibition of CA using acetazolamide results in potent inhibition of insulin secretion by isolated rat islets. We had previously shown that IL-1 inhibits secretion by a mechanism that includes beta cell expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase and production of nitric oxide, followed by nitric oxide-mediated inhibition of islet mitochondrial function (27Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Hill J.R. McDaniel M.L. Marshall S.M. Home P.D. Rizza R.A. The Diabetes Manual. 9. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1995: 265-294Google Scholar). The addition of the CA inhibitor acetazolamide resulted in an inhibition of insulin secretion to levels comparable in magnitude to the inhibitory actions of IL-1. The specific localization of CA-V in beta cells and the failure to find any other carbonic anhydrase in this cell type make CA-V the most likely target for this inhibition by acetazolamide. These findings provide functional evidence to support a role for CA-V in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by isolated rat islets.There are at least two possible mechanisms by which mitochondrial CA-V could participate in the regulation of insulin secretion. First, CA-V may provide HCO3− for pyruvate carboxylase, which in turn participates in the pyruvate-malate shuttle operating across the mitochondrial membranes. Pyruvate carboxylase is abundantly expressed in the mitochondrial islet cells. Unlike the case in gluconeogenic tissues, where CA-V provides bicarbonate for pyruvate carboxylase to convert pyruvate to oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis (4Dodgson S.J. Forster R.E. Storey B.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 429: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,7Dodgson S. Dodgson S.J. Tashian R.E. Gros G. Carter N.D.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the coupling of CA-V to pyruvate carboxylase in islets has another role. Islets contain essentially no phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which would be needed to use the product of pyruvate carboxylase to form phosphoenolpyruvate in gluconeogenesis (12MacDonald M.J. Chang C.M. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Instead, a study by MacDonald (11MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the product of pyruvate carboxylase is important in the pyruvate-malate shuttle, which provides NADPH for normal beta cell function. Ashcroft and Christie (16Ashcroft S.J.H. Christie M.R. Biochem. J. 1979; 184: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that the cytosolic NADPH/NADP ratio is increased in glucose-stimulated islets, and MacDonald (11MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the pyruvate-malate shuttle is the major means of generating cytosolic NADPH from the metabolism of glucose. If cytosolic NADPH concentrations modulate insulin secretion, CA-V could play a strategic role in this regulation by providing bicarbonate for pyruvate carboxylase in the proposed shuttle mechanism.A second mechanism by which CA-V could be linked to insulin secretion is in the regulation of mitochondrial calcium concentrations. Glucose is known to induce a rise in intramitochondrial calcium concentration and a smaller rise in cytosolic calcium concentration (28Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Elder and Lehninger (29Elder J.A. Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 976-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and Balboni and Lehninger (30Balboni E. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3563-3570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used isolated rat liver mitochondria to demonstrate that mitochondrial CA is essential for a rapid mitochondrial uptake of calcium. The correlation of intramitochondrial calcium concentration with insulin secretion from INS-1 cells observed by Kennedy et al. (28Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) suggested a fundamental role for calcium ions in the energy requirements for exocytosis of insulin from beta cells. In light of the present and previous findings, it will be of great interest to examine the role of CA-V in regulating the intramitochondrial calcium concentration and the cytosolic NADPH/NADP ratio, both of which are believed to be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion by beta cells.

However, pyruvate carboxylase in islet cells does not appear to be associated with gluconeogenesis because these cells do not exhibit phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity, which is required for gluconeogenic pathways (12MacDonald M.J. Chang C.M. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).

In the course of a survey of rodent tissues for expression of CA-V, we identified rat and mouse islet cells as cells in which CA-V is highly expressed. Since bicarbonate is known to be a substrate for pyruvate carboxylase, and it is also nonpermeable to the mitochondrial membrane, we assume that its role is to provide bicarbonate for pyruvate carboxylase in pancreatic islets. Double immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analyses of alpha and beta cells purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) allowed us to identify the beta cell as the islet cell type in which CA-V is expressed. These findings led us to examine the effect of acetazolamide, a widely used CA inhibitor, on glucose-stimulated insulin release by isolated rat islets. Strong inhibition was observed, suggesting that at least one of the CA isoenzymes may be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion. Since CA-V is the only CA we could identify in beta cells, we concluded that CA-V plays some role in the regulation of insulin secretion. RESULTSFig. 1 shows the immunoperoxidase staining of CA-V in tissue sections of rat (panel A) and mouse (panel B) pancreases. In both species, the enzyme was predominantly expressed in islets of Langerhans. Only a weak immunoreactivity was found in the exocrine pancreas. The CA-V-positive cells represented a majority of the islet cells and were centrally located inside an individual islet. The high magnification view in Fig. 1 B (inset) indicates that the immunoreaction for CA-V is granular, showing a typical mitochondrion-like staining pattern. Control immunostaining using normal rabbit serum showed no positive reaction in mouse islets (Fig. 1 C). Fig. 2 shows confocal laser scanning microscopy images of the immunofluorescence reaction for CA-V in a mouse islet (panel A) and an isolated rat islet cell (panel B). The positive reaction was clearly granular, suggesting that the enzyme is located in the mitochondria of these cells.To determine the identity of CA-V-positive cells found in islets, CA-V and insulin were immunostained simultaneously in pancreatic tissue sections and isolated rat islet cells. Fig. 3 A shows a low magnification view of a double-immunostained entire mouse islet. The predominantyellow color indicates that CA-V and insulin colocalize in the same cells. Double staining of isolated rat islet cells for CA-V and insulin also indicated that CA-V is expressed in beta cells (Fig. 3, B and C).Figure 3Confocal laser scanning images of CA-V (A and B) and insulin (A and C) in a mouse pancreatic section (A) and in isolated islet cells of rat pancreas (B and C).

These findings provide experimental evidence to support a role for carbonic anhydrase in the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by isolated rat islets. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have used immunocytochemistry and Western blotting to demonstrate the expression of mitochondrial CA-V in the endocrine pancreas. Immunohistochemical staining of rat and mouse pancreases showed granular mitochondrion-like positive reaction in islet cells. The large number of CA-V-positive cells in each islet and their central distribution suggested that the enzyme is located in beta cells. Indeed, double immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections and isolated islet cells for CA-V and insulin showed that CA-V is expressed in pancreatic beta cells. The specificity of the localization was confirmed using Western blotting, which revealed that islets and FACS-purified beta cells express the 33-kDa precursor and 30-kDa mature forms of CA-V, whereas no signal was detected in alpha cells. The high level of expression of mitochondrial CA-V in pancreatic beta cells and very little or no expression in other pancreatic cell types suggest that CA-V has a highly cell-specific function in mitochondria of beta cells, presumably related to their specific metabolic needs for mitochondrial bicarbonate.Among the many factors capable of stimulating insulin secretion in beta cells, glucose is physiologically the most important. Mitochondrial oxidation of glucose, resulting in the production of ATP, is required for insulin secretion (26Hedeskov C.J. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 442-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We show here that selective inhibition of CA using acetazolamide results in potent inhibition of insulin secretion by isolated rat islets. We had previously shown that IL-1 inhibits secretion by a mechanism that includes beta cell expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase and production of nitric oxide, followed by nitric oxide-mediated inhibition of islet mitochondrial function (27Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Hill J.R. McDaniel M.L. Marshall S.M. Home P.D. Rizza R.A. The Diabetes Manual. 9. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1995: 265-294Google Scholar). The addition of the CA inhibitor acetazolamide resulted in an inhibition of insulin secretion to levels comparable in magnitude to the inhibitory actions of IL-1. The specific localization of CA-V in beta cells and the failure to find any other carbonic anhydrase in this cell type make CA-V the most likely target for this inhibition by acetazolamide. These findings provide functional evidence to support a role for CA-V in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by isolated rat islets.There are at least two possible mechanisms by which mitochondrial CA-V could participate in the regulation of insulin secretion. First, CA-V may provide HCO3− for pyruvate carboxylase, which in turn participates in the pyruvate-malate shuttle operating across the mitochondrial membranes. Pyruvate carboxylase is abundantly expressed in the mitochondrial islet cells. Unlike the case in gluconeogenic tissues, where CA-V provides bicarbonate for pyruvate carboxylase to convert pyruvate to oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis (4Dodgson S.J. Forster R.E. Storey B.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 429: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,7Dodgson S. Dodgson S.J. Tashian R.E. Gros G. Carter N.D.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the coupling of CA-V to pyruvate carboxylase in islets has another role. Islets contain essentially no phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which would be needed to use the product of pyruvate carboxylase to form phosphoenolpyruvate in gluconeogenesis (12MacDonald M.J. Chang C.M. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Instead, a study by MacDonald (11MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the product of pyruvate carboxylase is important in the pyruvate-malate shuttle, which provides NADPH for normal beta cell function. Ashcroft and Christie (16Ashcroft S.J.H. Christie M.R. Biochem. J. 1979; 184: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that the cytosolic NADPH/NADP ratio is increased in glucose-stimulated islets, and MacDonald (11MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the pyruvate-malate shuttle is the major means of generating cytosolic NADPH from the metabolism of glucose. If cytosolic NADPH concentrations modulate insulin secretion, CA-V could play a strategic role in this regulation by providing bicarbonate for pyruvate carboxylase in the proposed shuttle mechanism.A second mechanism by which CA-V could be linked to insulin secretion is in the regulation of mitochondrial calcium concentrations. Glucose is known to induce a rise in intramitochondrial calcium concentration and a smaller rise in cytosolic calcium concentration (28Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Elder and Lehninger (29Elder J.A. Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 976-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and Balboni and Lehninger (30Balboni E. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3563-3570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used isolated rat liver mitochondria to demonstrate that mitochondrial CA is essential for a rapid mitochondrial uptake of calcium. The correlation of intramitochondrial calcium concentration with insulin secretion from INS-1 cells observed by Kennedy et al. (28Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) suggested a fundamental role for calcium ions in the energy requirements for exocytosis of insulin from beta cells. In light of the present and previous findings, it will be of great interest to examine the role of CA-V in regulating the intramitochondrial calcium concentration and the cytosolic NADPH/NADP ratio, both of which are believed to be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion by beta cells. In this study, we have used immunocytochemistry and Western blotting to demonstrate the expression of mitochondrial CA-V in the endocrine pancreas.

The epidermis constitutes a dynamic tissue, which provides a natural barrier between the organism and the environment. It is constantly renewed through a process where proliferating keratinocytes leave the basal layer and progressively differentiate as they migrate through suprabasal layers until they reach the surface of the skin and are shed off. During this process keratinocytes undergo distinct morphological and biochemical changes (reviewed in Ref. 1Holbrook K.A. Leigh M. Lane E.B. Watt F.M. The Keratinocyte Handbook. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1994: 3-42Google Scholar) and irreversibly lose their proliferative activity (2Missero C. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell. Differ. 1996; 4: 1-16Google Scholar). Little is yet known about the molecular factors and signal transduction pathways governing these changes (3Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). One of the hallmarks of keratinocyte terminal differentiation is the synthesis of the cornified cell envelope (CE),1 a highly insoluble structure formed beneath the plasma membrane and constituted by specific precursor proteins, which are cross-linked by the action of transglutaminases (reviewed in Refs. 4Hohl D.

An interesting feature of the different members of the SPRRgene family is that their expression is differentially regulated bothin vivo and in vitro. For instance, SPRR3 protein is strongly expressed in oral and esophageal epithelium but not in the epidermis (11Hohl D. Viragh P.A. d. Amiguet-Barras F. Gibbs S. Backendorf C. Huber M. J. Investig. Dermatatol. 1995; 104: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Fujimoto W. Nakanishi G. Arata J. Jetten A.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 200-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Conversely in normal human epidermis SPRR2 is expressed coherently, whereas SPRR1 is mainly confined to appendageal regions (11Hohl D. Viragh P.A. d. Amiguet-Barras F. Gibbs S. Backendorf C. Huber M. J. Investig. Dermatatol. 1995; 104: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In sublingual epithelium SPRR3 is found in all suprabasal layers, SPRR1 is confined to the uppermost living layers, and SPRR2 is absent (11Hohl D. Viragh P.A. d. Amiguet-Barras F. Gibbs S. Backendorf C. Huber M. J. Investig. Dermatatol. 1995; 104: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In psoriatic skin SPRR1 and SPRR2 are strongly increased in contrast to SPRR3 (11Hohl D. Viragh P.A. d. Amiguet-Barras F. Gibbs S. Backendorf C. Huber M. J. Investig. Dermatatol. 1995; 104: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Fujimoto W. Nakanishi G. Arata J. Jetten A.M. J. Investig.

Furthermore, expression of the different members of the SPRR gene family appears to be differentially affected by carcinogenic transformation (23Lohman F.P. Medema J.K. Gibbs S. Ponec M. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The expression of SPRR genes is also influenced by external factors that are believed to modulate keratinocyte terminal differentiation, such as ultraviolet light (10Gibbs S. Lohman F.P.

These findings clearly illustrate that theSPRR genes are targeted by many different signaling pathways and regulatory factors, all related to the process of keratinocyte terminal differentiation. In agreement with this notion we have recently shown that expression of the SPRR2A gene is strictly dependent on the concerted action of four different classes of transcription factors that are targeted by different signaling pathways (12Fischer D.F. Gibbs S. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5365-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here we have analyzed the regulatory elements and corresponding transcription factors involved in the expression of theSPRR1A gene. Interestingly, both similarities and striking differences in regulation are observed between these two members of the same gene family. Primary human keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskin and grown in the presence of a feeder layer of lethally γ-irradiated mouse 3T3 fibroblasts in a standard medium consisting of a 3:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 1 μm isoproterenol, and 5% bovine calf serum (Hyclone). 2–3 days after plating, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor was added. For experiments described here, passage 3 cultures were used. Air-exposed cultures of human primary keratinocytes were grown for 11 days at 37 °C on a support of de-epidermized dermis essentially as described by Ponec et al. (31Ponec M. Gibbs S. Weerheim A. Kempenaar J. Mulder A. Mommaas A.M. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1997; 289: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with the only exception that de-epidermized dermis from neonatal pig skin was used. Rabbit polyclonal monospecific antibodies directed against SPRR1, SPRR2, and SPRR3 have been described previously (9Kartasova T. Muijen G.V. van Pelt-Heerschap H. van de Putte P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2204-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Hohl D. Viragh P.A. d. Amiguet-Barras F. Gibbs S. Backendorf C. Huber M. J. Investig. Dermatatol. 1995; 104: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Air-exposed cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. For morphological observations, sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections for immunohistochemistry were pretreated for 5 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 and subsequently incubated for 30 min with 2% normal sheep serum to reduce aspecific antibody binding. Sections were incubated for 1 h with a 1:500 dilution of the specific antibody, followed by incubation with a secondary anti-rabbit antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase. Enzyme detection was performed by using the AP color reagents of Bio-Rad. Transient transfections and the stratification assay were previously described in detail elsewhere (12Fischer D.F. Gibbs S. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5365-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Shortly, confluent cultures of keratinocytes, grown in standard medium, were changed for 2 days to DMEM without calcium supplemented with 5% Chelex-treated serum (DMEM − calcium). After discarding the suprabasal differentiated cells (stripping), the remaining monolayers were incubated with 5 μg of CAT reporter plasmid and 25 μg of N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N, N, N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate, transfection reagent exactly as described previously. Cells were then either maintained in fresh DMEM − calcium or induced to stratify for 40 h in DMEM containing 5% serum but lacking growth factors (DMEM + calcium, 1.8 mm calcium). For TPA induction, transfected monolayers were first maintained for 16 h in DMEM − calcium and subsequently incubated for 24 h in fresh DMEM − calcium containing either 20 ng/ml TPA or no TPA. Cell lysates were prepared as described by Gorman et al. (32Gorman C.M. Moffat L. Howard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar), and CAT activity was measured by fluor diffusion CAT assay (33Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar) using Econofluor II premixed scintillation fluid (NEN Research Products) and [14C]acetyl-coenzyme A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as specified by NEN Research Products. Results are expressed as counts/min transferred to the organic solvent phase per min of reaction time in the linear range of the reaction. In experiments where different 5′ deletion or mutant SPRR1Apromoter constructs were compared, pSG2-luc plasmid (12Fischer D.F. Gibbs S. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5365-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which contains the promoter of the related SPRR2A gene fused to the luciferase gene, was used as an internal control. 1 μg of luciferase and 4 μg of CAT plasmid were co-transfected, and the same cells were used for both CAT and luciferase assays, with the only difference that the aliquot used for luciferase detection was not heat-treated. The luciferase activity was determined in a Berthold Lumat luminometer by using the Promega luciferase assay system. Internal controls are, however, not absolutely necessary as corrections made by taking into account the internal control did not significantly change the outcome of the experiments. Total RNA isolation from cultured keratinocytes and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines and Northern blotting were performed as described previously (23Lohman F.P. Medema J.K. Gibbs S. Ponec M. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hybridization with specific probes was according to Gibbs et al. (10Gibbs S. Lohman F.P. Teubel W. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4401-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, 4 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed with avian myoblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (HT Biotechnology Ltd.) and random hexamer primers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 5% of this reaction mixture was amplified by PCR for 33 cycles, including 1-min steps of 94, 56, and 72 °C, respectively. Primers used for SPRR1A were 5′-ACACAGCCCATTCTGCTCCG and 5′-TGCAAAGGAGCGATTATGATT and for SPRR1B5′-ATACAGAGTATTCCTCTCT and 5′-TCTCTTCAGTGAATTCTGAG. These primers generate DNA fragments of 453 and 537 bp for SPRR1A and SPRR1B, respectively. All plasmids used for transfections were isolated on Qiagen columns fromEscherichia coli strain DH5α. pSG227 and pSG293 were constructed by introducing respectively 2000 or 4100 base pairs preceding the SPRR1A translational start site from the genomic λspr1A clone (18Gibbs S. Fijneman R. Wiegant J. Geurts van Kessel A.J. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Genomics. 1993; 16: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) in front of the CAT gene of plasmid pBLCAT5. pBLCAT5 is derived from pBLCAT3 (34Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) by deleting vector sequences between the EcoO109I and NdeI sites (provided by Dr. R. Offringa, Leiden). The plasmids contain the entireSPRR1A intron, the first noncoding exon and, respectively, 844 (pSG227) and approximately 3000 (PSG293) base pairs of promoter sequence. pSG233 was created by deleting sequences between thePstI site (−844) and a Bsp120-I site (−448). In pSG234 aPstI-HpaI fragment was deleted. All other promoter deletion clones were derived from pSG227 and generated by exonuclease III digestion. Point mutations were generated in pBluescript vectors (Stratagene) by the method of Kunkel (35Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar), after which the mutant inserts were reintroduced into the CAT reporter plasmid. All deletions and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A human keratinocyte specific cDNA library was screened with a mixture of Ets domain specific probes, derived from ets-2, PU.1, and net (provided by Dr. B. Wasylyk, Strasbourg). One clone (A12) was identical to the reported ESE-1b clone (37Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinsky M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and an N-terminal BamHI fragment was used as the ESE-1-specific clone. Clone B8 corresponded to the Ets-2 transcription factor. From this clone an N-terminal SacI fragment served as an Ets-2-specific probe. Nuclear extracts (36Schreiber E. Matthias P. Mueller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) were prepared from keratinocytes grown to confluence in standard medium (mixed population of proliferating and differentiating cells), from proliferating cells growing in KSFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), or from stripped cells induced to differentiate by the addition of 1.8 mmcalcium medium (stratification assay). EMSA with the AP-1 binding site were performed in a total volume of 20 μl with 3 μg of nuclear extract in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, 60 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4% Ficoll 400, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 20 fmol of32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 22.5 mm Tris borate (pH 7.9), 0.625 mm EDTA, and 2% glycerol for 90 min at 10 V/cm. For supershift analysis 3 μg of nuclear extracts were preincubated with 2 μl of specific antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and subsequently processed as described above. Ets-binding proteins were assayed in a 20-μl volume using 5 μg of nuclear extract in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 20 fmol of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, in 25 mm Tris, 190 mmglycine, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5% glycerol gel for 90 min at 10 V/cm. Oligonucleotides were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis and reverse-phase chromatography, and subsequently annealed to the unlabeled complementary strand. The following oligonucleotides were used (only one strand is shown and the core binding site is underlined): AP-1, GTAGTGTGAGTCATGTGTG; (m)AP-1, GGTAGTGTGAAGCTTGTGTGACAG; AP-1(2A), CTTCTGTGAGTCAGGAGAGC; AP-1(3), GGACAGTGAGTCAGGCCCAG; Ets-87, CAGGTGAGGAATGAAAAC; Ets-55, CTTCTATTTCCTTGAGGC; (m)Ets-55, AGAGCTTCTAGAGCCTTGAGGCA; Ets(2A), GGGTAGTTTCACTTCCTGCTG. The following rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Transcruz Gel Supershift reagents): c-Jun (sc-45), Jun-B (sc-46), Jun-D (sc-74), c-Fos (sc-52), Fos-B (sc-48), Fra-1 (sc-605), and Fra-2 (sc-604). The specificity of these antibodies has previously been demonstrated in human skin (68Welter J. Eckert R.L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1687-2681Google Scholar), and their use in supershift analysis of nuclear extracts from human keratinocytes has been documented (47Jang S.-I. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24105-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When primary human keratinocytes are seeded onto de-epidermized dermis, a fully differentiating epidermis is formed approximately 1 week after lifting the cultures to the air-liquid interface. The stratified tissue, which is generated, resembles in many aspects living epidermis (31Ponec M. Gibbs S. Weerheim A. Kempenaar J. Mulder A. Mommaas A.M. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1997; 289: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry revealed that in this organotypic culture system SPRR3 is not expressed (Fig. 1 d), which is in concordance with earlier in vivo observations in human epidermis (11Hohl D. Viragh P.A. d. Amiguet-Barras F. Gibbs S. Backendorf C. Huber M. J. Investig. Dermatatol. 1995; 104: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). SPRR1 was detected in both spinous and granular layers (Fig. 1 b), whereas SPRR2 expression was restricted to the granular layer (Fig. 1 c). These results indicate that during the process of terminal differentiation SPRR1 is expressed at earlier stages than SPRR2. In submerged keratinocyte cultures, SPRR1and SPRR2 transcripts are induced by calcium with different kinetics and efficiency (23Lohman F.P. Medema J.K. Gibbs S. Ponec M. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Similar differences betweenSPRR1 and SPRR2 transcript levels were also found after treating submerged cultures with TPA (Fig. 2). Although both SPRR1 and SPRR2 are efficiently induced, the respective induction factors are clearly different (compare lanes 1 and 5 in panels a and b). The expression of SPRR3 is not affected by TPA (panel c). The decrease in transcript signal observed after 24 h for each gene is at least in part due to RNA degradation, as can be concluded from a smear of smaller products below the major hybridizing RNA bands in lanes 6 and 7 (shown for 28 S rRNA, panel d). RNA degradation has been observed in parallel experiments and is likely part of the TPA response.Figure 2Analysis of SPRR1, SPRR2,and SPRR3 transcripts after TPA treatment of normal human keratinocytes. Keratinocytes were cultured in standard medium to confluence and treated with 20 ng/ml TPA, and total RNA was isolated 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h later (lanes 1–7, respectively). The same blot was incubated with32P-labeled probes specific for either SPRR1(a), SPRR2 (b), SPRR3(c), or ribosomal 28 S RNA (d) (23Lohman F.P. Medema J.K. Gibbs S. Ponec M. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Blots were exposed to Kodak X-AR5 films. Each lane contained 20 μg of total cytoplasmic RNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Promoter fragments derived from the original SPRR1A genomic clone (18Gibbs S. Fijneman R. Wiegant J. Geurts van Kessel A.J. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Genomics. 1993; 16: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), containing, respectively, 3000 (pSG293), 844 (pSG227), or 173 base pairs (pSG237) upstream of the transcriptional start site, were fused to the CAT reporter gene and assayed in transient transfection experiments. All constructs contain the SPRR1A intron and the 19-nucleotide untranslated region of exon 2 (18Gibbs S. Fijneman R. Wiegant J. Geurts van Kessel A.J. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Genomics. 1993; 16: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In a first set of experiments, stripped monolayers of keratinocytes (see “Materials and Methods”) were transfected with the differentSPRR1A-promoter-CAT constructs and assayed after inducing cell stratification and differentiation by the addition of DMEM + calcium medium (1.8 mm calcium). Identical expression levels were measured for each one of the three promoter constructs (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were also obtained for TPA induction (Fig. 3 B). Apparently the shortest promoter construct (pSG237), with 173 bp of upstream sequence, contains all regulatory elements necessary for calcium- and TPA-regulated expression. Analysis of the 173-bp long proximal promoter region revealed a putative recognition site for the AP-1 family of transcription factors (5′-TGAGTCA-3′ at position −108) and two potential Ets factor binding sites (5′-AGGAA-3′ at position −87 and 5′-TTCCT-3′ at position −55). Specific point mutations in each one of these elements had a clear inhibitory effect on promoter activity in the calcium-induced differentiation assay (Fig. 4 A). Mutations in the AP-1 and Ets55 binding sites resulted in a complete inhibition of induced expression, which did not significantly exceed the level of the uninduced wild-type control (−Ca). Conversely, a mutation in the Ets87 site resulted only in partial (approximately 30%) inhibition of SPRR1A expression. The same mutants were also assayed for TPA induction (Fig. 4 B). Here only the Ets55 mutation (pSG289) resulted in a complete loss of TPA inducibility, whereas both the AP-1 (pSG287) and the Ets87 mutant (pSG288) constructs were still inducible, although to a lesser extent (approximately 66% residual activity). EMSAs were used to identify nuclear factors interacting with the two putative Ets elements found in the proximalSPRR1A promoter. Incubation of keratinocyte nuclear extracts with the double-stranded Ets55 probe generated two retarded bands (Fig. 5, lane 1). Competition with increasing amounts of unlabeled Ets55 DNA revealed that only the lower band is specific (lanes 2–4). A similar competition (lanes 11–13) is also observed with the Ets binding site of the SPRR2A promoter (12Fischer D.F. Gibbs S. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5365-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which has previously been shown to be recognized by the epithelial specific Ets transcription factor ESE-1 (37Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinsky M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), implying that both sites may be recognized by the same binding activity. No competition is found with the mutant Ets55 binding site (lanes 5–7), indicating that loss of factor binding is responsible for the loss of promoter activity in construct pSG289. Interestingly, no competition was found with the second Ets binding site (lanes 8–10), suggesting that Ets87 is a much weaker binding site, a situation which is not uncommon for the Ets family of transcription factors (38Crepieux P. Coll J. Stehelin D. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1994; 5: 615-638PubMed Google Scholar). Weaker binding might explain the fact that mutations in this site result only in a partial inhibition of promoter activity (Fig. 4). The experiments described in Fig. 4 Bindicate"

Northern blot analysis has shown that its mRNA is expressed in a variety of tissues.

Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis has revealed that γ2-adaptin is localized to paranuclear vesicular structures that are not superimposed on structures containing γ1-adaptin. Furthermore, unlike γ1-adaptin, γ2-adaptin is recruited onto membranes in the presence of a fungal antibiotic, brefeldin A.

In eukaryotic cells, transport of proteins between membrane-bound compartments along the exocytic and endocytic pathways involves coated carrier vesicles that bud from a donor compartment and fuse with a target acceptor compartment(s) (for review, see Refs. 1Schmid S.L.

Both the clathrin adaptor complexes are composed of two large subunits, a medium chain, and a small subunit: β1(β′)-adaptin, γ-adaptin, μ1 (AP47), and ς1 (AP19) in AP-1; and β2 (β)-adaptin, α-adaptin, μ2 (AP50), and ς2 (AP17) in AP-2 (for review, see Refs. 6Keen J.H.

The clathrin-coated vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane play a direct role in receptor-mediated endocytosis, whereas those budding from the TGN are thought to be involved in sorting of lysosomal proteins into the lysosomal/endosomal system. Recently, the adaptor complexes have been shown to be capable of interacting through their medium chains (μ1 and μ2) with the Tyr-containing sorting signals within the cytoplasmic domain of various plasma membrane, lysosomal membrane, and TGN-resident membrane proteins (Refs 8Ohno H.

On the other hand, a morphological study has suggested the presence of another class of clathrin-coated vesicles on early endosomes that do not contain the AP-1 nor AP-2 complex (13Stoorvogel W. Oorschot V. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Very recently, a novel adaptor-related complex, named AP-3, has been discovered and shown to be localized to the endosomal and TGN compartments and may function in protein transport from the Golgi to the lysosomal/endosomal system (14Newman L.S.

In the present study, we identified a novel adaptor-related protein, designated as γ2-adaptin, that is highly similar to γ-adaptin (called as γ1-adaptin in this paper) not only in the primary structure but also in the domain organization. It is expressed in various tissues and is mainly localized to paranuclear vesicular structures, which are different from γ1-adaptin-containing structures. Analysis using the yeast two-hybrid system revealed that γ2-adaptin is capable of interacting with the ς1 chain and a novel ς1-like protein. Random-primed cDNA of human hepatoma HepG2 cells was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with three sets of oligonucleotide primers synthesized on the basis of sequences of GenBankTM human expressed sequence tags (ESTs), accession numbers T49401, F07336, and R87719, the predicted amino acid sequences of which showed a significant homology but that was not identical to that of γ-adaptin. The amplified DNA fragments were separately subcloned into the pBluescript® II KS(+) vector (Stratagene), and their sequences were confirmed. A mixture of the three cDNA fragments were then used to screen ∼4 × 105 phages of a HepG2 cDNA library (21Hosaka M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biomed. Res. 1994; 15: 383-390Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Six phage clones, which were hybridized with all the three probes, were isolated, and their cDNA insert was subcloned into the NotI site of pBluescript® II KS(+). A combination of three cDNA clones was presumed to cover the entire coding sequence, and their sequences were determined from both strands using a BcaBest sequencing kit (Takara Shuzo, Co.). The same HepG2 cDNA library was also screened with a mouse γ-adaptin cDNA fragment as a probe, which was obtained by PCR amplification of mouse brain cDNA with primers synthesized on the basis of the published sequence (22Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and 17 positive clones were obtained. A combination of two cDNA clones covered the entire coding sequence of human γ1-adaptin. Human ς1B cDNAs were cloned from the HepG2 library by screening with a partial cDNA probe that was obtained by PCR amplification of random-primed cDNA of HepG2 cells with primers synthesized on the basis of an EST sequence (accession number, AA453805). An I.M.A.G.E. clone (ID 646802) covering the entire coding sequence of human ς1A was obtained from UK Human Genome Mapping Resource Center. A human multiple tissue RNA blot (CLONTECH) was sequentially probed with a32P-labeled cDNA fragment of human γ2- or γ1-adaptin, ς1A, or ς1B according to the instruction of the manufacturer. The probes used were: γ2-adaptin, a 550-bpStuI-ApaI fragment (nucleotides 1902–2451); γ1-adaptin, a 2,204-bp NcoI-Bsp120I fragment (nucleotides 580–2783); ς1A, a 494-bpKpnIApaI fragment (nucleotides 83–576); and ς1B, a 591-bp fragment (nucleotides 28–618). For use in the yeast two-hybrid system, bait vectors of γ2- (pGBT9-γ2) and γ1-adaptins (pGBT9-γ1) were constructed by ligation of PCR-amplified cDNA fragments covering the entire coding sequence of human γ2- and γ1-adaptins into the BamHI and either NotI orEcoRI sites of pGBT9-BEN, which is a derivative of pGBT9 (CLONTECH) constructed by replacing the original polylinker sequence between the EcoRI and BamHI sites with the sequence 5′-GAATTTGGATCCGAGCTCGAATTCGCGGCCGCGATCC-3′. Prey vectors of human β1- and β2-adaptins; mouse ς1A, μ1, and μ2 chains; human ς1B, ς2, ς3A and ς3B chains; and rat μ3A and μ3B chains were constructed by ligation of PCR fragments of corresponding cDNAs into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGAD10 (CLONTECH). A mammalian expression vector for γ2-adaptin (pcDNA3-γ2) was constructed by subcloning of a cDNA fragment covering the entire coding sequence of γ2-adaptin into the multiple cloning site of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Construction of a variant of the pcDNA3 vector with an influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope sequence downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter (pcDNA3-HAN) was described previously (23Shin H.-W. Shinotsuka C. Torii S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An expression vector for HA-tagged γ2-adaptin (pcDNA3-HA-γ2) was constructed by ligation of the human γ2-adaptin cDNA fragment described above into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3-HAN. Polyclonal γ2-adaptin antisera were raised in two rabbits against a C-terminal 19-amino acid peptide conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and one (no. 93) of them worked well. The antiserum was affinity purified as described (24Sambrook L. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.16-18.18Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-lamp-1 and monoclonal mouse anti-TGN38 were kindly provided by K. Akasaki (Fukuyama University, Japan; Ref. 25Akasaki K. Michihara A. Mibuka K. Fujiwara Y. Tsuji H. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and G. Banting (University of Bristol, UK; Ref. 26Horn M. Banting G. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), respectively. Monoclonal mouse anti-γ1-adaptin antibodies, clone nos. 88 and 100.3, were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and Sigma, respectively. Monoclonal mouse (12CA5) and rat (3F10) antibodies against the HA epitope were from Boehringer Mannheim. All fluorescent and peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. pcDNA3-γ2 or pcDNA3-HA-γ2 was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells using a CellPhect transfection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and cultured for 48 h. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.25 m NaCl) containing a CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) by repeated vortexing. The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For preparation of the cytosol and membrane fractions, 293 cells or HL-60 cells washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline were homogenized in ice-cold cytosol buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml glucose) containing the Complete™ mixture by 5 × 30 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 120,000 × gfor 60 min at 4 °C to obtain cytosol and membrane fractions. The pellet was washed once with cytosol buffer and lysed in the cell lysis buffer. The membrane fraction of HL-60 cells was further fractionated by a modified method of Simpson et al. (15Simpson F. Bright N.A. West M.A. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pellet of the membrane fraction was resuspended in ice-cold cytosol buffer. The suspension containing ∼1.0 mg of protein was loaded onto 12 ml of 0–40% Nycodenz (Nycomed Pharma AS) linear gradients in cytosol buffer. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor at 37,000 rpm for 4 h at 4 °C, and 0.6-ml fractions were collected from the bottom. The fractions were diluted with four volumes of cytosol buffer and centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 60 min, and the pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The cell lysates and the cell fractions were boiled in an SDS-PAGE sample buffer, electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The blot was incubated sequentially with either anti-γ2-adaptin, anti-HA (3F10) or anti-γ1-adaptin (100.3) antibodies, and peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and detected using a Renaissance Chemiluminescence ReagentPlus (NEN Life Science Products) according to the instruction of the manufacturer. Recruitment experiments were performed by the method of Robinson and Kreis (27Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Briefly, normal rat kidney (NRK) cells grown on 9-cm culture dishes were washed twice with cytosol buffer and then frozen by floating the dishes in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, the permeabilized cells from two dishes were scraped, divided into six aliquots, and washed twice with cytosol buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of cytosol buffer or cytosol (∼250 μg of protein) containing 1 mm EGTA and an ATP regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 80 μg/ml creatine kinase) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. When indicated, 1 mm GTP, 100 μm GTPγS, or 100 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) was also included. After the incubation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-γ2-adaptin antibodies or monoclonal anti-γ1-adaptin antibody (no. 100.3) as described above. Rat hepatocyte Clone 9 cells, NRK cells, or monkey kidney Vero cells grown in wells of 8-well Lab-Tek-II chamber slides (Nunc) were transfected with pcDNA3-γ2 or pcDNA3-HA-γ2 using a TransIT-LT1 polyamine transfection reagent (PanVera Corp.). The transfected cells were cultured for 12 h and processed for indirect immunofluorescence analysis as described previously (23Shin H.-W. Shinotsuka C. Torii S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Torii S. Banno T. Watanabe T. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11574-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells fixed and permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C for 5 min were incubated with anti-γ2-adaptin or anti-HA (3F10) antibodies in combination with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against γ1-adaptin (no. 88), TGN38, or lamp-1 at 4 °C overnight. The cells were then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies. The stained cells were observed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (TCS NT, Leica Lasertechnik). Yeast transformation and two-hybrid screening and assays were performed according to the instructions for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). For screening of proteins that were capable of interacting with γ2-adaptin, yeast Y190 cells were transformed with pGBT9-γ2 using lithium acetate-based method and grown on synthetic medium lacking Trp. The transformant was then transformed with a mouse liver or brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH), grown for 8 h in synthetic medium lacking Trp, Leu, and His, and plated on synthetic medium lacking Trp, Leu, and His and containing 25–50 mm 3-aminotriazole. After 9–10 days of incubation, colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity by use of a replica filter assay. Library plasmids from positive clones were rescued intoEscherichia coli HB101 by plating on Leu-free medium and subsequently analyzed by retransformation tests and DNA sequencing. β-Galactosidase activity was also measured by a liquid culture assay using o-nitrophenylgalactoside as a substrate (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 13.6.2-13.6.5Google Scholar). To examine interactions of γ2- or γ1-adaptin with other adaptor components, Y190 harboring pGBT9-γ2 or pGBT9-γ1 was transformed with a pGAD10-based plasmid containing a full-length cDNA of each adaptor component and subjected to assay for β-galactosidase activity as described above. We exploited the availability of large data bases of ESTs to identify novel adaptor-related proteins. A search of the GenBankTM EST data base using the TBLASTN algorithm revealed that several human ESTs encoded sequences homologous but not identical to γ-adaptin. We obtained partial cDNA fragments by PCR amplification of human hepatoma HepG2 cell cDNA using sets of primers specific to these ESTs and used them as probes to screen a HepG2 cDNA library. Sequence analysis of the positive cDNA clones revealed that a combination of three cDNAs had an open reading frame of 785 amino acids. The predicted human protein shows 60% identity to mouse γ-adaptin. A rare possibility that the human protein was a counterpart of mouse γ-adaptin is excluded by the fact that, from the same human cDNA library, we cloned a cDNA that encodes a protein with 99% identity to mouse γ-adaptin. Therefore, we hereafter refer to the novel γ-adaptin-like protein as γ2-adaptin and γ-adaptin as γ1-adaptin. Fig. 1 A shows the deduced amino acid sequences of human γ1- and γ2-adaptins. The overall amino acid identity between the two γ-adaptins was 60%. The primary structure of adaptins is generally dissected into three domains (7Pearse B.M.F. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar): the N-terminal head (core/trunk) domain, the C-terminal ear (appendage) domain, and the Pro-rich hinge region connecting the two domains (Fig. 1 B). Between γ2- and γ1-adaptins, most conserved is the head domain with a 69% amino acid identity (Fig. 1 B). In this domain, γ2-adaptin is also significantly similar to other adaptin family members (Fig. 1 B). In the ear domain, γ2-adaptin is highly similar to γ1-adaptin (49% identity) but not significantly to other adaptins (<15% identity). In the primary structure and in length, the hinge region is not significantly conserved. Northern blot analysis was performed to examine whether γ2-adaptin shows tissue-specific expression because some adaptor components are expressed ubiquitously, whereas others are expressed in specific tissues. As shown in Fig. 2 B, two mRNA species of 2.8 and 3.8 kilobases were detected for γ2-adaptin in all but one (skeletal muscle) tissues examined. In the brain, another species of ∼8.5 kilobases was also detected. When the same blot was reprobed for γ1-adaptin, a 7.5-kilobase mRNA was detected in all tissues (Fig. 2 A). The widespread expression of γ1- and γ2-adaptins suggests that both play a fundamental role in most tissues. To characterize the γ2-adaptin protein, an antiserum (no. 93) was raised in a rabbit against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 19 amino acids of γ2-adaptin and affinity purified. Western blot analysis with the antibodies (Fig. 3 A) revealed a protein of ∼87 kDa, which is approximating the calculated molecular weight of γ2-adaptin (M r = 87,116), in a lysate of human embryonic kidney 293 cells (lane 1). In a lysate of 293 cells transfected with the expression vector for HA-tagged (pcDNA3-HA-γ2) or untagged (pcDNA3-γ2) γ2-adaptin, a more intense band was detected at the corresponding position (lanes 2 and 3). When probed with the anti-HA antibody (3F10), an ∼87-kDa band was detected only in the pcDNA3-HA-γ2-transfected cell lysate (lane 5). On the other hand, an ∼100-kDa band was detected with the monoclonal anti-γ1-adaptin antibody, no. 100.3, (lanes 7–9). These results indicate that the antibodies are able to recognize γ2-adaptin and do not cross-react with γ1-adaptin. To examine if γ2-adaptin was present in the cytosol or associated with membranes, cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared from 293 cells or HL-60 cells and subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 B, an ∼87-kDa protein was detected in both the fractions of 293 cells. Similar results were obtained with the HL-60 cell fractions (data not shown). The data suggest that, like other adaptor proteins, γ2-adaptin might cycle between the cytosolic and membrane pools. To examine the subcellular localization of γ2-adaptin, we performed indirect immunofluorescence analysis. Because the anti-γ2-adaptin antibodies we prepared were unable to detect the endogenous γ2-adaptin protein by immunofluorescence (data not shown), cells were transfected with the expression vector for γ2-adaptin tagged with (pcDNA3-HA-γ2) or without (pcDNA3-γ2) the HA epitope sequence and examined with anti-HA or anti-γ2-adaptin antibodies, respectively (Fig. 4). In transfected rat Clone 9 hepatocytes, γ2-adaptin, whether HA-tagged or not, was localized to paranuclear structures, which were often observed as large vesicles (panels A, D, and G). A similar staining pattern of γ2-adaptin was observed in transfected NRK and Vero cells (data not shown). Double labeling experiments revealed that γ2-adaptin was not colocalized with γ1-adaptin (panels A-C) or TGN38 (panels D-F), a TGN membrane protein. These observations indicate that γ2-adaptin, unlike γ1-adaptin, is not associated with TGN membranes. Furthermore, the γ2-adaptin staining was not superimposed on that of β-COP, a COP I component (data not shown), or α-mannosidase II, a Golgi marker protein (data not shown), indicating that the γ2-adaptin-containing structures differ from Golgi compartments. Because the large vesicular staining often observed for γ2-adaptin was reminiscent of the pattern for markers for the lysosomal/endosomal system, double labeling with antibodies against lamp-1, a marker for lysosomes and late endosomes, was also performed. However, the staining of γ2-adaptin differed from the vesicular staining of lamp-1 (panels G-I). Although the immunofluorescence analysis using transfected cells indicates that γ2-adaptin is associated with subcellular structures distinct from those of γ1-adaptin, there remained a possibility that the overexpression of γ2-adaptin might cause aberrant aggregation of the protein. To circumvent this problem, we further fractionated the membrane fraction of HL-60 cells by Nycodenz gradient centrifugation and examined whether endogenous γ2- and γ1-adaptins were associated with distinct membrane compartments by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5, γ2-adaptin was present in lighter membrane fractions than γ1-adaptin. Taken together with the immunofluorescence observations, the data show that γ2- and γ1-adaptins are associated with distinct subcellular compartments. We then examined effects of BFA on the localization of γ2-adaptin because this drug is known to cause dissociation of AP-1 and COP I from their target membranes through inhibiting membrane binding of a small GTP-binding protein, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), the membrane binding of which triggers recruitment of coat proteins onto membranes (for review, see Refs. 2Rothman J.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 30Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar, 31Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, treatment of γ2-adaptin-transfected Clone 9 cells with BFA resulted in dissociation of γ1-adaptin from TGN membranes (compare panels B and D). By contrast, the same treatment did not affect the staining pattern of γ2-adaptin (compare panels A and C). Thus, membrane association of γ2-adaptin appear to be regulated in a manner different from that of AP-1 and COP I. To corroborate the above data, we utilized an in vitrosystem originally designed to study the recruitment of γ1-adaptin onto membranes (27Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Permeabilized NRK cells were incubated with HL-60 cytosol under various conditions. Fig. 7shows typical Western blots. Without addition of cytosol, a small amount of γ2-adaptin was detected in NRK cell membranes, whereas γ1-adaptin was not (lane 1) because the anti-γ2-adaptin antibodies cross-react with rat γ2-adaptin and the monoclonal anti-γ-adaptin antibody (100.3) cannot recognize rodent γ1-adaptin (27Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). When the cell membranes were incubated with the donor cytosol in the presence of GTP, both γ1- and γ2-adaptins were recruited onto the membranes (lane 2). When incubated in the presence of GTPγS, which activates GTP-binding proteins including ARF, an increase in the γ1-adaptin recruitment was observed (lane 3). Under the same incubation conditions, however, recruitment of γ2-adaptin was not enhanced. Pretreatment with BFA before addition of GTPγS largely inhibited the γ1-adaptin recruitment (lane 5), and pretreatment with GTPγS negated the effect of BFA (lane 4). By contrast, BFA did not inhibit the recruitment of γ2-adaptin (lane 5). Thus, the data on effects of BFA on membrane recruitment of γ1- and γ2-adaptins (Fig. 7) agree well with the immunofluorescence data (Fig. 6). In an attempt to identify protein components that constitute a putative adaptor-related complex containing γ2-adaptin, we made use of the yeast two-hybrid system. Reporter yeast cells that were first transformed with a plasmid encoding a fusion between the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and γ2-adaptin were transformed with a mouse liver or brain cDNA library encoding proteins as C-terminal fusions with the GAL4 activation domain. Screening of ∼2 × 106 and ∼4 × 106 transformants from the liver and brain libraries yielded 4 and 20 positive clones, respectively, showing a His+ and β-galactosidase+ phenotype (for example, see Fig. 8). Restriction endonuclease mapping and sequence analyses of rescued plasmids revealed that 17 plasmids contained cDNA inserts encoding the mouse ς1 chain (AP19, Ref. 32Kirchhausen T. Davis A.C. Frucht S. Greco B.O. Payne G.S. Tubb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11153-11157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were derived from at least seven independent cDNA clones. We further examined whether γ2-adaptin was capable of interacting with small chains of other adaptor complexes using the two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 8, yeast cells cotransformed with γ2-adaptin and the ς1 chain grew efficiently on a plate lacking His and showed a high level of β-galactosidase activity, indicating a strong interaction between γ2-adaptin and the ς1 chain; for the reason described below, ς1 is hereafter called ς1A. By contrast, γ2-adaptin did not show an interaction with the ς2, ς3A, or ς3B chain. Similar results were obtained using γ1-adaptin as a bait (Fig. 8). We then examined if γ2-adaptin was able to interact with β1- and β2-adaptins because Page and Robinson have shown using the two-hybrid system that γ1-adaptin is able to interact with β1-adaptin, although with a relatively low affinity (33Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, γ2-adaptin failed to show a significant interaction with β1- and β2-adaptins, whereas γ1-adaptin showed a significant interaction with β1-adaptin as described by Page and Robinson (31Moss J.

We also examine whether γ2-adaptin was capable of interacting with medium chains (μ1, μ2, μ3A, and μ3B) but failed to show the interaction (not shown), as expected from the report of Page and Robinson (33Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) showing that neither γ1- or α-adaptin can interact with medium chains. When we performed the above experiments, we noticed by searching the EST data base the presence of several human ESTs that were deduced to encode parts of a protein, the sequence of which was highly similar but not identical to the reported mouse ς1 (ς1A) sequence (32Kirchhausen T. Davis A.C. Frucht S. Greco B.O. Payne G.S. Tubb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11153-11157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore cloned and sequenced a cDNA for the ς1-like protein. As shown in Fig. 9, the predicted ς1-like protein, named ς1B, consists of 157 amino acid residues and shows an 87% overall amino acid identity to mouse ς1A. The human ς1B is not a counterpart of mouse ς1A, since we also cloned and sequenced a human ς1A cDNA, the deduced amino acid sequence of which was identical to that of mouse ς1A. Northern blot analysis revealed that both ς1A and ς1B are expressed ubiquitously (Fig. 10). A two-hybrid analysis revealed that ς1B was capable of interacting with both γ1- and γ2-adaptins (Fig. 8).Figure 10Northern blot analysis of the ς1A (A) and ς1B (B) chain mRNAs. Human multiple tissue RNA blot was analyzed with a ς1A or ς1B cDNA fragment as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The positions of the RNA size markers are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we identified a ubiquitously expressed, novel human adaptor large chain-like protein, designated as γ2-adaptin. This protein is most similar to γ-adaptin, which is called γ1-adaptin in this paper, not only in the primary sequence but also in the domain organization. The similarity suggests that γ2-adaptin is also a component of an adaptor or adaptor-related complex. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, we showed that γ2-adaptin as well as γ1-adaptin is capable of binding to the ς1 (ς1A) chain, which is the small chain of the AP-1 adaptor complex (Fig. 8). Furthermore, both γ1- and γ2-adaptins are able to interact with a novel small chain-like protein, named ς1B, which shows 87% amino acid identity to the ς1A chain. The interaction seems to be specific, because neither γ1- nor γ2-adaptin was able to interact with other examined small chains, and because Page and Robinson also showed by the two-hybrid analysis that γ1-adaptin is able to bind to ς1 but not to ς2, whereas the opposite is the case for α-adaptin (33Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that γ2-adaptin, unlike γ1-adaptin, did not show a significant interaction with β1-adaptin in the two-hybrid analysis. Taken together, these data suggest that, although γ1- and γ2-adaptins share the same small chain, ς1A or ς1B, they use distinct β-chains and possibly distinct medium chains to form the adaptor complexes. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the two-hybrid analysis could not reveal additional interactions because of conformational differences between native adaptor proteins and the fusion proteins or because of environmental differences between the cytoplasm of mammalian cells and the yeast nucleus. Although we failed to identify the β-like chain and the medium chain that form a complex with γ2-adaptin, there are several ESTs in the data base that can code for parts of proteins homologous but not identical to the known β-chains and medium chains. Cloning of cDNAs for such candidates are currently underway in our laboratory. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that γ2-adaptin was not colocalized with γ1-adaptin; the former was localized to structures around the nucleus often observed as relatively large vesicles, whereas the latter was to typical Golgi-like paranuclear structures (Fig. 4). Furthermore, Nycodenz gradient centrifugation was able to separate a membrane compartment containing γ2-adaptin from that containing γ1-adaptin (Fig. 5). These observations suggest that the putative γ2-adaptin-containing complex is responsible for formation of coated vesicles different from the AP-1 clathrin-coated vesicles. In addition, the vesicular structures associated with γ2-adaptin appear to be different from lysosomal/endosomal compartments. Another observation that discriminates between γ1- and γ2-adaptins is that membrane recruitment of γ2-adaptin was not affected by BFA (Figs. 6 and 7). BFA inhibits guanine-nucleotide exchange on a small GTP-binding protein, ARF, and thereby inhibits its binding to Golgi membranes, which is a prerequisite process for membrane binding of the AP-1 and COP I complexes (2Rothman J.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 30Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J.

Furthermore, recruitment to membranes of AP-3 has recently been shown to be sensitive to this drug (16Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The data therefore indicate that recruitment from the cytosol to membranes of the putative γ2-adaptin-containing complex is regulated in a manner different from that of the AP-1 and AP-3 adaptors, possibly in an ARF-independent manner. Delivery of proteins to the lysosomal/endosomal system and to the cell surface involves sorting into distinct pathways from the TGN. On the other hand, the endocytic pathway may involve many functionally distinct compartments, although it is difficult to determine a precise relationship between the compartments because of their dynamic nature. Furthermore, there may be interactions between the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways (for review, see Ref. 34Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taking into account the subcellular localization of γ2-adaptin, we speculate that the putative γ2-adaptin-containing complex may function at some trafficking step in the complex pathways between the TGN and the cell surface. It is, however, clear that further studies, for example using mutagenesis of the adaptor components in an attempt to affect the complex, will be required for uncovering the function of the complex.

Biochemical and confocal microscopy analyses at the level of the cardiocyte revealed that p70S6K is present predominantly in the cytosol, substantially activated in 1-h RVPO (>12 fold), and phosphorylated in the pseudosubstrate domain at the Ser-411, Thr-421, and Ser-424 sites. p85S6K, which was localized exclusively in the nucleus, showed activation subsequent to p70S6K, with a sustained increase in phosphorylation for up to 48 h of RVPO at equivalent sites of p70S6K, Thr-421 and Ser-424, but not at Ser-411. Neither isoform translocated between the cytosol and the nucleus. Further studies to determine potential upstream elements of S6K activation revealed: (i) similar time course of activation for protein kinase C isoforms (α, γ, and ε) and c-Raf, (ii) absence of accompanying phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, (iii) activation of c-Src subsequent to p70S6K, and (iv) similar changes in adult cardiocytes after treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Thus, these studies suggest that a protein kinase C-mediated pathway couples pressure overload to growth induction via differential activation of S6K isoforms in cardiac hypertrophy.

Thus, these studies suggest that a protein kinase C-mediated pathway couples pressure overload to growth induction via differential activation of S6K isoforms in cardiac hypertrophy. Hypertrophic cardiac growth occurs by an increase in cellular mass via a relatively coordinate increase in cellular protein content (1Cooper G. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the terminally differentiated adult cardiac muscle cell, translational mechanisms have a key role in regulating the rate of protein synthesis during hypertrophic growth. Phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of 40 S ribosomal S6 protein (S6 protein) has been shown to regulate protein synthesis rate by mediating protein translational initiation and elongation (2Stewart M.J. Thomas G. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and a growing number of studies show strong correlation between translational efficiency and S6 protein phosphorylation (3Frost V.

However, S6K is suggested to be primarily responsible for the S6 protein phosphorylation upon stimulation of cells with insulin and a variety of mitogenic stimuli (8Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 9Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). S6K consists of two isoforms transcribed by a single gene due to alternative splicing: a 70-kDa cytoplasmic isoform (p70S6K) and a 85-kDa nuclear isoform (p85S6K) with an additional 23 residues at the amino terminus consisting of a putative nuclear targeting sequence (11Grove J.R. Banerjee P. Balasubramanyam A. Coffer P.J. Price D.J. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Both isoforms are known to phosphorylate the S6 protein and mediate the translation of polypyrimidine tract mRNA, including transcripts of ribosomal proteins and translational elongation factors (12Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In addition to playing a role in protein translational control, nuclear p85S6K has been shown to be important for transcriptional activation (13de Groot R.P. Ballou L.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1994; 79: 81-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), increased DNA synthesis, and G1 to S phase transition (14Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). For activation, both isoforms of S6K undergo phosphorylation on multiple sites, which are largely classified into two groups (although the same numbering is used for both p70S6K and p85S6K, 23 residues should be added to convert to the numbering of p85S6K). The first set of rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation sites consists of Thr-229 in the catalytic domain and Thr-389 and Ser-404 in the linker region and is implicated in the catalytic activity (15Han J.-W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21396-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The second set of phosphorylation sites consists of four Ser/Thr residues (Ser-411, Ser-418, Thr-421, and Ser-424) in the pseudosubstrate region of S6K (also known as autoinhibitory domain), and their phosphorylation, except Ser-411, is independent of the rapamycin-sensitive pathway (15Han J.-W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21396-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these residues in the pseudosubstrate domain has been shown to play a role in regulating kinase function in vivo, although it is not essential for catalytic activity (17Price D.J. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16281-16284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mahalingam M. Templeton D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, a third phosphorylation locus has been identified in which phosphorylation of the Ser-371 site is shown to be required for kinase activity (19Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall R.E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). S6K activation has been shown to be mediated both by protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent and -independent mechanisms (6Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6007-6010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The PKC-independent pathway has been attributed primarily to growth factor receptor/tyrosine kinase-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase) (21Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In the PKC-dependent pathway, S6K activation has been shown to proceed in the absence of PI 3-kinase activation (21Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 22Monfar M. Lemon K.P. Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chung J. Vlahos C.J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As S6K is important in the control of both translational and transcriptional activation, the key events mediating cardiac hypertrophy, we initiated a study to determine whether the isoforms of this kinase are activated in pressure-overloaded myocardium. In the present study, we show for the first time a substantial activation of S6K in pressure overloaded myocardium in vivo. This activation is accompanied by a distinct pattern and time course of phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic and the nuclear isoforms of S6K occurring at the level of the cardiocytes of pressure overloaded myocardium. Our studies also indicate that this mechanically induced signaling pathway is mediated by PKC and is independent of PI 3-kinase. Right ventricular pressure overload (RVPO) hypertrophy was induced by partial occlusion of the pulmonary artery in adult cats of either sex, weighing 2.6–3.9 kg, either by external banding (for 48-h and long term RVPO; Ref. 24Cooper G. Satava R.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1974; 37: 762-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or via a balloon-tipped catheter (for 1- or 4-h RVPO; Ref. 25Rozich J.D. Barnes M.A. Schmid P.G. Zile M.R.

In both models, pressure in the right ventricle (RV) was more than doubled, whereas systemic arterial pressure remained unaltered. Controls, as appropriately specified, consisted of sham-operated cats submitted to thoracotomy and pericardiotomy without hemodynamic intervention, or the normally loaded left ventricle (LV) from each cat. At least three animals were used per group for subsequent studies. After removing the heart from the surgically anesthetized cats, the aorta was cannulated, flushed retrograde with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the heart was either immediately processed or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for later use. Cardiocytes were isolated from normal adult cat hearts as described previously (26Cooper G. Mercer W.E. Hoober J.K. Gordon P.R. Kent R.L. Lauva I.K. Marino T.A. Circ.

E-64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane), aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Triton X-100, sodium orthovanadate, leupeptin, pepstatin,p-aminobenzamidine, EGTA, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, β-glycerophosphate, and insulin were from Sigma; dithiobissuccinimidylpropionate from Pierce; TPA and okadaic acid from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and S6 substrate peptide from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from Du Pont. Sheep anti-rabbit IgG coated dynabeads (M-280) were purchased from Dynal (Lake Success, NY). Triton X-100-lysed subfractions, namely Triton X-100-soluble high spin supernatant, Triton X-100-insoluble low spin pellet (cytoskeleton), and high spin pellet (membrane skeleton) from ventricular tissue samples were prepared as we and others have described previously (27Kuppuswamy D.

Cytosolic and membrane fractions from ventricles were prepared as described previously with minor modifications (29Kuppuswamy D. Dalton M. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19134-19142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 mg of tissue was homogenized in a Tekmar Tissuemizer (Tekmar Co., Cincinnati, OH) in 2 ml of homogenization buffer containing 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm EGTA, protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μm E-64, and 200 μg/ml p-aminobenzamidine) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 μm okadaic acid, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The homogenate was transferred into a Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton Co., Millville, NJ) and further processed with 40 strokes on ice. To remove unbroken cells and debris, the homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh set of tubes and further centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet, which contains predominantly the membrane fraction, was resuspended in 1 ml of SDS sample buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and boiled for 5 min. The supernatant, referred to as the cytosolic fraction, was used either for kinase assays or for Western blot analysis after boiling with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (27Kuppuswamy D. Kerr C. Narishige T. Kasi V.S. Menick D.R. Cooper G., IV J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4500-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the following antibodies were commercially obtained: monoclonal antibodies: anti-c-Raf from Transduction Laboratories Inc., Lexington, KY; anti-c-Src from Upstate Biotechnologies Inc. Polyclonal antibodies: anti-COOH-terminal S6K (C-18) from Santa Cruz Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; anti-phospho-Ser-411 S6K (P-Ser-411), anti-phospho-Thr-421/Ser-424 S6K (P-Thr-421) and anti-phospho-Ser-473 Akt from New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA; isoform-specific anti-PKC and anti-phosphotyrosine from Transduction Laboratories Inc., Lexington, KY; and anti-PI 3-kinase from Upstate Biotechnologies Inc. Polyclonal antibody specific for the p85 isoform of S6K (C-3) was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. George Thomas, Friedrich Miescher-Institut, Basel, Switzerland. p70S6Kactivity was measured after immunoprecipitation with C-18 antibody using cytosolic samples obtained from control and pressure-overloaded ventricles. For this, 100 μl of the cytosolic fraction was added to 0.9 ml of dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above). The samples were then mixed with 1 μg of antibody or non-immune IgG (controls), and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Pre-washed protein A beads (10 μl, Pierce) were then added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h. The immune complexes were washed three times with dilution buffer and once with kinase assay buffer (30 mmTris, pH 7.4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmDTT, and 1 mm EGTA). The immune complexes were then used for measuring kinase activity as defined by Kuppuswamy et al. (29Kuppuswamy D. Dalton M. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19134-19142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 2 mm synthetic peptide substrate (31Terada N. Franklin R.A. Lucas J.J. Blenis J. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12062-12068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), homologous to a region in the S6 protein. In order to measure the p70S6K activity in TPA-treated cells, adult cardiocytes (4 × 106) were cultured on 100-mm laminin-coated plates. After 12 h, the cardiocytes were treated with 100 nm TPA for various time periods, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and used for preparing cytosol as described for the tissue samples except that the homogenization was performed by sonication for 1 min on ice. p70S6K was immunoprecipitated with C-18 antibody and assayed for kinase activity. For measuring and comparing p70S6K activity with p85S6K in pressure-overloaded myocardium, respective antibodies, C-18 and C-3 (specific for p85S6K), were conjugated with secondary antibody-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads), as specified by the manufacturer and used for immunoprecipitation with total extracts obtained with 2% Triton buffer as described previously (27Kuppuswamy D.

PI 3-kinase activity was measured similar to the protocol described by Auger et al. (32Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 mg of tissue or 4 × 106cultured cardiocytes were homogenized in 1 ml of extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described before. The supernatant after centrifugation at 30,000 × g was diluted to 1 ml with extraction buffer (final protein concentration at 0.5 mg/ml), mixed with 1 μg of antibody raised against the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; polyclonal), and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The immune complex was precipitated with protein-A agarose beads, and sequentially washed as follows: three times with the extraction buffer; three times with 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4 containing 5 mm LiCl and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate; and twice with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The PI 3-kinase activity was measured using phosphatidylinositol (PI) as a substrate. The organic phase, containing the lipid products, was used for TLC separation in chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia (60:47:11:3.2 (v/v)). Unlabeled phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was run in parallel to determine the position of phosphorylated PI. Fresh frozen ventricular tissue sections (7 μm) were fixed and immunolabeled as follows. Sections were cross-linked with 1 mm dithiobissuccinimidylpropionate in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C, extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 prepared in Hanks' balanced salt solution, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (33Safiejko-Mroczka B.

After blocking the sections with 10% goat serum in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, they were incubated with primary antibodies overnight. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, the sections were further incubated with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA), as well as TR-phalloidin and YoYo-1 (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Imaging was done on a Bio-Rad MRC-1000 laser scanning confocal microscope, and the pictures were processed using Adobe Photoshop 4.0 software (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA). The ratios of the nuclear phosphorylation signal (P-Thr-421 and P-Ser-424) from RV and LV were calculated as described by Angst (34Angst B.D. Khan L.U. Severs N.J. Whitely K. Rothery S. Thompson R.P. Magee A.I. Gourdie R.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and compared for differences between control, 4-h, and 48-h RVPO using an analysis of variance test followed by Fisher's protected least significant differencepost hoc test (SuperAnova, Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). After Bonferroni's correction for significance levels, values with p < 0.016 were considered as statistically significant. Data were tested for normal distribution and homogeneity of variance prior to analysis and shown as means ± S.E. The focus of the present study was to determine whether pressure overload-induced hypertrophic cardiac growth is accompanied by the activation of one or both the isoforms of S6K. In order to determine the complete activation profile, both short term (1–4 h) and long term (48 h or longer) pressure overload feline models were used. Three different approaches were utilized to study the changes associated with S6K isoforms: (i) Western blot analysis with either regular S6K antibody or with phosphospecific S6K antibodies for measuring phosphorylation, (ii) immune complex assays for kinase activity, and (iii) confocal immunostaining studies for determining phosphorylation occurring at the level of cardiocytes in the pseudosubstrate domain of cytoplasmic (p70S6K) as well as nuclear (p85S6K) isoforms of S6K. To demonstrate whether S6K isoforms are activated in pressure-overloaded myocardium, pressure-overloaded right ventricles and normally loaded same-animal control left ventricles were used to obtain total lysates by extracting with Triton X-100 lysis buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After resolving the proteins on SDS-PAGE, Western blotting was performed first with the C-18 antibody that detects both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of S6K. A 70-kDa protein doublet (Fig. 1 A) representing p70S6K could be readily detected in the normally loaded control ventricles (LV or RV). Analysis of pressure-overloaded right ventricular samples revealed a shift in the mobility of p70S6K (i.e. disappearance of the lower band with the appearance of a new band on top of the upper band), which is indicative of phosphorylated species of S6K. This change in SDS gel migration of p70S6K was observed as early as 1 h RVPO, persisted up to 4 h, reverted partially at 48 h (i.e. reappearance of the bottom band), and returned to the control level in 1-week pressure-overloaded RV. The detection of p85S6K (Fig. 1 A), which also showed a doublet in control ventricles, revealed distinct differences in pressure-overloaded ventricles, when compared with p70S6K. Although retarded mobility was similar at 1 and 4 h RVPO, p85S6K did not decline appreciably at 48 h RVPO (i.e. the lower band for p85S6K was still absent in contrast to the reappearance of the lower band for p70S6K) and was back to control levels only at the later time point of 1-week RVPO. Furthermore, the exposure time for p85S6K during ECL development of the Western blots needed to be doubled. This relatively low level of detection could be due to either an isoform-specific change in the antibody binding epitope or low levels of the p85S6K isoform in the heart. We confirmed these changes at each time point of pressure overloading with at least three independent experimental cats. In summary, the data clearly indicate that both isoforms of S6K exhibit mobility band shift on SDS-PAGE in response to pressure overloading with observable differences in the time course. Although mobility change on SDS-PAGE has been reported to be indicative of kinase activation due to phosphorylation of the rapamycin-sensitive sites (35Ferrari S. Pearson R.B. Siegmann M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16084-16091Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 36Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), it does not represent phosphorylation of the pseudosubstrate domain. To address the possibility that the pseudosubstrate domain of S6K also undergoes phosphorylation in response to pressure overloading, phosphospecific antibodies were employed in the Western blot experiments. Among the four known phosphorylation sites of the pseudosubstrate domain, only Ser-411 has been shown to be sensitive to inhibition by rapamycin (15Han J.-W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21396-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). When P-Ser-411 antibody was used in the Western blot analysis, Ser-411 phosphorylated p70S6K was detected exclusively in the pressure-overloaded myocardium, whereas it was almost completely absent in all the normally loaded ventricular samples (Fig. 1 B). The time course of Ser-411 phosphorylation, which was seen maximally between 1 and 4 h of RVPO and declined sharply at 48 h, matches the time course of load-induced p70S6K band shifting shown in the previous experiment (Fig. 1 A). These experiments, therefore, suggest that p70S6K is phosphorylated on the Ser-411 residue in addition to other sites of S6K (as multiple species were observed in Fig. 1 A) in response to pressure overloading. Interestingly, the P-Ser-411 antibody did not detect the p85S6K isoform either in control or pressure-overloaded ventricular samples, indicating that this isoform is not phosphorylated at the Ser-411 residue in response to pressure overload. This was true even after increasing either the sample volume for SDS-PAGE (twice the concentration, 40 μg of protein) and/or a longer time period of ECL detection in the Western blot analysis (data not shown). All these studies indicate that the kinase(s) responsible for the phosphorylation of the Ser-411 site of p85S6K is either absent or inactive in the nucleus, whereas it is activated in the cytoplasm in response to pressure overloading. To determine whether the changes in the phosphorylation status of S6K are associated with kinase activation, we analyzed the activity of p70S6K using a synthetic peptide substrate homologous to the S6 protein after immunoprecipitating the kinase from cytosolic samples of control and pressure-overloaded ventricles with the regular S6K antibody (C-18). Western blot analysis with C-18 antibody did not detect p85S6K in the cytosolic samples (data not shown). Therefore, when the immune complexes are prepared with the cytosolic samples, their activities represent mostly that of p70S6K. As shown in Fig. 2, a more than 12-fold activation of S6K (most of it due to p70S6K) was observed following 1-h pressure overloading, slightly decreased at the 4-h time point, markedly declined when RVPO was extended for 48 h, and reached the basal condition by 1 week of RVPO. We confirmed the time course of this kinase activation in two other independent experimental cats for each time point. Therefore, both Western blot experiments and immune complex kinase assays show that the cytosolic p70S6Kis activated substantially in pressure-overloaded myocardium as early as 1 h of RVPO. Next, to analyze whether the activated p70S6K translocates to the nucleus during pressure overloading, we used confocal microscopy of fresh-frozen tissue sections. Although P-Ser-411 antibody detected exclusively p70S6K (Fig. 1 B), this antibody was not effective for immunostaining. Therefore, we took advantage of the regular C-18 antibody, which was found to be strongly reactive with the p70S6K (cytoplasmic) compared with the p85S6K(nuclear) isoform of S6K (Fig. 1 A). When this antibody was used for confocal microscopy, it detected only the cytoplasmic S6K (corresponding to the p70S6K isoform) as anticipated,i.e. the signal is distributed evenly in the sarcoplasm (decorated in red) of both control and 4 h pressure-overloaded ventricular cardiocytes (Fig. 3). No S6K signal was found in the nuclei (labeled in green) when analyzed either in the normally loaded control ventricles or in the 4-h pressure-overloaded right ventricles. These data suggest that p70S6K, following load-induced phosphorylation and activation, did not translocate to the nucleus. As phosphorylation of the Ser-411 residue of the pseudosubstrate domain was observed exclusively for the cytoplasmic isoform (p70S6K) during pressure overloading (Fig. 1 B), we employed another phosphospecific antibody (P-Thr-421) to determine phosphorylation at other known sites in the pseudosubstrate domain of S6K isoforms. This antibody detects S6K when both Thr-421 and Ser-424 residues in the pseudosubstrate domain are phosphorylated simultaneously. Interestingly, Western blot analysis with this antibody revealed phosphorylation not only of p70S6K but also of p85S6K in response to pressure overload (Fig. 4 A). Neither isoform was phosphorylated in normally loaded control ventricles (LV or RV). Phosphorylation of Thr-421/Ser-424 residues of both the isoforms could be detected as early as 1 h of RVPO; however, although phosphorylation of these residues for the p70S6K isoform declined sharply after pressure overloading for 48 h, phosphorylation for the p85S6K isoform was sustained in the 48-h pressure-overloaded myocardium and required a longer time period for the phosphorylation to decline, as the basal lev"

The Rab family, consisting of over 30 members, belongs to the small G protein superfamily and is implicated in intracellular vesicle trafficking (for reviews, see Refs. 1Simons K. Zerial M.

Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The Rab3 subfamily belongs to this Rab family and consists of four members, Rab3A, -B, -C, and -D (for reviews, see Refs. 5Fischer von Mollard G. Stahl B. Li C. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 164-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar and 6Takai Y. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Of these members, Rab3A and -C are present in cells with Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, particularly abundant in the neuron, although Rab3B and -C are also expressed in other types of cells. Evidence is accumulating that Rab3A is involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, particularly in neurotransmitter release. Recent knock-out mice results indicate that Rab3A is not essential for Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release but plays two different roles: to efficiently dock synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic plasma membrane (7Geppert M. Bolshakov V.Y. Siegelbaum S.A. Takei K. De-Camilli P. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and to regulate the efficiency of the fusion process (8Geppert M. Goda Y. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Rab3A is involved in the formation of long term potentiation in hippocampus (9Castillo P.E. Janz R. Südhof T.C. Tzounopoulos T. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The Rab family members, including the Rab3 subfamily members, have the GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms, which are interconvertible by GDP/GTP exchange and GTPase reactions (4Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 6Takai Y. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms of the Rab family members in the regulation of vesicle trafficking remain unknown, but the GDP/GTP cycling of the Rab family members is essential for their functions. The GDP/GTP cycling is regulated by three types of regulators, GDP/GTP exchange protein (GEP),1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP), and GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) (for reviews, see Refs. 4Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 6Takai Y. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, and 10Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Kikuchi A. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. CIBA Found. Symp. 1993; 176: 128-146PubMed Google Scholar). GEP is a regulator that stimulates the GDP/GTP exchange reaction and thereby the conversion from the GDP-bound form to the GTP-bound form, and GAP stimulates the GTPase activity and thereby the conversion from the GTP-bound form to the GDP-bound form. GDI has three activities (4Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 6Takai Y. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 1) GDI preferentially interacts with the GDP-bound form and keeps it in the GDP-bound form in the cytosol by preventing it from being converted to the GTP-bound form by the action of each GEP and from being associated with its target membrane; 2) GDI transports its complexed Rab family member to each target membrane where the GDP-bound form dissociates from GDI, followed by conversion to the GTP-bound form by the action of each GEP; and 3) after the GTP-bound form accomplishes its function, it is converted to the GDP-bound form by the action of each GAP. Once the GDP-bound form is produced, GDI forms a complex with it and translocates it to the cytosol. Of these three types of regulators, Rab GDI is a general regulator of all the Rab family members (4Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 6Takai Y. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).

Rab3 GEP was purified as a monomeric protein, whereas Rab3 GAP was purified as heterodimeric proteins with M r of about 130,000 (p130) and 150,000 (p150) as estimated by SDS-PAGE. p130, but not p150, showed the catalytic activity. Moreover, the purified sample of Rab3 GAP showed a M r of about 300,000 as estimated by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. These results suggested that p130 is the catalytic subunit of Rab3 GAP whereas p150 is the noncatalytic subunit. In this study, to obtain the definitive evidence that p150 is the noncatalytic subunit of Rab3 GAP and to clarify the physiological function of p150, we attempted to clone the cDNA of p150, to determine its primary structure, and to characterize it. A human brain cDNA library in λZAPII was provided by Dr. Y. Nakamura (Osaka University Medical School, Suita). Lipid-modified Rab3A was purified from the membrane fraction of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells expressing the Rab3A cDNA (17Kikuchi A. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). His6-tagged p130 and p150 were expressed in Escherichia coli DE3 and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column chromatography as described (14Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the N-terminal region of p130 (aa residues 1–303) and the maltose-binding protein fusion protein of the middle region of p150 (aa residues 511–850). The anti-p130 and -p150 polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified on fusion proteins coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose HP columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. A mouse anti-Rab3A monoclonal antibody, SG-11-7, was prepared as described (19Mizoguchi A. Kim S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Yorifuji H. Hirokawa N. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Hybridoma cells expressing a mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Rab3 GAP was purified from rat brain synaptic soluble fraction as described (14Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol.

The Mono Q sample of Rab3 GAP (13 μg of protein) was subjected to SDS-PAGE, the protein band corresponding to p150 was cut out from the gel and digested with a lysyl endopeptidase, and the digested peptides were separated by C18 reverse phase high pressure liquid column chromatography as described (20Imazumi K. Sasaki T. Takahashi K. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The aa sequences of the peptides were determined with a peptide sequencer (Hewlett-Packard G1005A protein sequencing system). A set of polymerase chain reaction primers was designed from human cDNA sequence (5′-GGCCGGTACCAAAAAATGCATTTTTCAAAGACCTAAC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGGTACCCTAACTTGAAGGTGATGGGCTAAATCC-3′). With these primers, the cDNA fragment was amplified from QUICK-Clone of human brain cDNA (CLONTECH). The authenticity of the cloned cDNA was verified by DNA sequencing (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52649) Google Scholar). The obtained fragment was used for screening a human brain cDNA library (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Extended sequences for the partial clones were obtained by rescreening the library by hybridization or by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (CLONTECH). The cDNA clones obtained were subcloned using a pBluescript plasmid, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. Mammalian expression plasmids pCMV-Hemagglutinin and pCMV-Myc were generated to express fusion proteins with the N-terminal Hemagglutinin and Myc epitopes, respectively (23Takeuchi M. Hata Y.

The cDNA fragments encoding full-length proteins of p150 and p130 were inserted into these plasmids. These cDNA fragments were also inserted into pRSET to produce the His6-tagged recombinant proteins in E. coli. Rat brain synaptic soluble fraction (2.7 mg of protein) was subjected to immunoprecipitation with 26 μg of the anti-p130 polyclonal antibody bound to 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and immunoblotting with the anti-p130 or anti-p150 polyclonal antibody. Recombinant p150 (50 pmol) was incubated with recombinant p130 (50 pmol) for 20 min at 4 °C. Purified Rab3 GAP (50 pmol), recombinant p130 alone (50 pmol), recombinant p150 alone (50 pmol), or the mixture of recombinant p130 and p150 was subjected to ultracentrifugation using 4.8 ml of a continuous sucrose density gradient (5–40% sucrose in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Centrifugation was performed at 220,000 × g for 14 h. Fractions of 150 μl each were collected. A 20-μl aliquot of each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by protein staining with silver. Lipid-modified Rab3A (3 pmol) was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in a reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% CHAPS, and 1.5 μm [γ-32P]GTP. The reaction was stopped by adding 2.5 μl of 80 mmMgCl2. To this mixture (12.5 μl), recombinant p130, recombinant p150, or a mixture of recombinant p130 and p150 was added in a total volume of 50 μl and further incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. The mixture was applied to a nitrocellulose filter, and the radioactivity retained on the filter was determined by Cerenkov counting. PC12 cells were plated at a density of 8 × 104 cells/35-mm dish and incubated for 24 h. The cells were transfected with 3 μg of pCMV-Myc-p130 or pCMV-Myc-p150, or co-transfected with 1.5 μg of pCMV-Hemagglutinin-p130 and 1.5 μg of pCMV-Myc-p150 by use of LipofectAMINE reagent (24Orita S.

Twenty-four hours after the transfection, the medium was changed to fresh medium containing 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor (18Sano K. Kikuchi A. Matsui Y. Teranishi Y. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After the cells were further incubated for 48 h, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. The fixed cells were washed with 50 mm ammonium chloride in PBS and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After being soaked in 10% FBS/PBS for 1 h, the cells were treated with the first antibodies in 10% FBS/PBS for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS three times, followed by incubation with the fluorescence-conjugated second antibodies in 10% FBS/PBS for 1 h. After being washed with PBS three times, the cells were examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 410; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The Northern blot sheets of poly(A)+ RNA from various human tissues were obtained from a commercial source (CLONTECH) and hybridized with the whole cloned cDNA of p150. Subcellular fractionation of rat brain was carried out as described (19Mizoguchi A. Kim S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Yorifuji H. Hirokawa N. Takai Y. J. Biol.

SDS-PAGE was performed as described (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out as described (26Towbin H. Staehelin T.

Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein as described (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar). In a preceding paper (14Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4655-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we purified Rab3 GAP from rat brain synaptic soluble fraction by column chromatographies, including Q-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, heparin-Sepharose, and Mono Q column chromatographies. On the final Mono Q column chromatography, we detected two proteins with M r of about 130,000 and 150,000, which coincided well with the GAP activity toward Rab3A. This Mono Q sample of Rab3 GAP (13 μg of protein), which was accumulated from 200 rat brains, was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the protein band with aM r of about 150,000 (p150) was cut out from the gel and digested with a lysyl endopeptidase. The peptides were separated by C18 reverse phase high pressure liquid column chromatography. Over 25 peptide peaks were observed, and the aa sequences of three peptides (peptide-3, -15, and -16) were determined. A search with these aa sequences against GenBankTM data bases revealed that peptide-3 was included in the aa sequence deduced from the cDNA fragment isolated from the cDNA library of human fetal liver and spleen (GenBankTM accession number T82880). This cDNA fragment was amplified from double-stranded human brain cDNA by polymerase chain reaction, and overlapping cDNA clones were isolated by screening a human brain cDNA library using the obtained fragment as a probe. Sequences for the partial clones were extended by rescreening of the library by hybridization and by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and we obtained a cDNA encoding a whole open reading frame of p150. In-frame stop codons in the 5′ and 3′ regions of the cDNA indicate that this clone contains the entire coding region. The cloned cDNA encoded a protein with a calculatedM r of 156,081 and 1393 aa (GenBankTMaccession number AF004828). All the aa sequences of the peptides, except 9 aa, were included in this sequence (Fig. 1). The slight differences of the aa sequences might be because of the differences in species. The cDNA encoding p150 showed no homology to any known protein. Northern blot analysis showed that about 7.5-kilobase mRNA of p150 was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (Fig. 2 A). Immunoblot analysis of the subcellular fractions of rat brain indicated that p130 and p150 were enriched in the synaptic soluble fraction (Fig. 2 B). 2H. Oishi, T. Sasaki, F. Nagano, W. Ikeda, T. Ohya, M. Wada, N. Ide, H. Nakanishi, and Y. Takai, unpublished data. In contrast, Rab3A is concentrated in the crude synaptic vesicle fraction (19Mizoguchi A. Kim S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Yorifuji H. Hirokawa N. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the tissue and subcellular distribution patterns of p150 are similar to those of p130. We next examined whether p150 is co-immunoprecipitated with p130 from rat brain synaptic soluble fraction. The synaptic soluble fraction was incubated with protein A-Sepharose containing the immobilized anti-p130 polyclonal antibody or rabbit IgG. Proteins with M r of about 130,000 and 150,000 were immunoprecipitated with the anti-p130 polyclonal antibody at a molar ratio of about 1:1 (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). Immunoblot analysis with the anti-p130 and -p150 polyclonal antibodies indicated that proteins with M r of about 130,000 and 150,000 were p130 and p150, respectively (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that p150 forms a complex with p130 in the synaptic soluble fraction. To further confirm the p130-p150 interactions, we examined these interactions using the recombinant proteins. When purified Rab3 GAP was subjected to continuous sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, two proteins with M r of 130,000 and 150,000 appeared in a single peak with a M r of about 300,000 as described (14Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4655-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). Recombinant p130 and p150 appeared in a single peak with aM r of about 110,000 and 170,000, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). When the mixture of recombinant p130 and p150 at the same molar ratio was then subjected to the same ultracentrifugation, both the proteins mostly shifted to the position with a M r of 300,000 (Fig. 4 D). The molar ratio of recombinant p130 and p150 in the peak fraction was estimated to be about 1:1 by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). These results indicate that p150 directly interacts with p130 and forms a heterodimer. We previously reported that recombinant p130 showed the GAP activity toward the Rab3 subfamily members (14Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4655-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because p150 indeed interacted with p130, we next examined whether recombinant p150 shows the Rab3A GAP activity or affects the activity of recombinant p130. Recombinant p150 did not show the Rab3A GAP activity under the conditions where recombinant p130 showed the activity (Fig. 5). In addition, recombinant p150 did not affect the Rab3A GAP activity of recombinant p130. In the last set of experiments, we expressed p130 and p150 in various combinations in PC12 cells to examine the localization of these proteins. When p130 alone was expressed in PC12 cells and the cells were differentiated into neuron-like cells by nerve growth factor, p130 was localized at both the soma and neurites (data not shown). When p150 alone was expressed in the cells, p150 showed the same distribution (data not shown). When p150 and p130 were co-expressed, the intracellular localization of each protein did not change (data not shown). These results indicate that p150 is co-localized with p130 and that p150 does not affect the localization of p130. In a preceding paper (14Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4655-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we isolated Rab3 GAP from rat brain and characterized it. We showed that Rab3 GAP was purified as a heterodimer of p130 and p150. We showed here several lines of evidence that p130 and p150 are the catalytic and noncatalytic subunits of Rab3 GAP, respectively: 1) p150 was co-purified with p130 as a heterodimer from rat brain on various column chromatographies; 2) tissue and subcellular distribution patterns of p150 and p130 were similar; 3) p150 was co-immunoprecipitated with p130 as a complex from rat brain synaptic soluble fraction; 4) recombinant p150 and p130 formed a heterodimer; 5) expressed p150 and p130 were co-localized in differentiated PC12 cells; and 6) p150 showed no Rab3 GAP activity under the conditions where p130 showed it. Many GAPs for the Rab family members in addition to Rab3 GAP have been isolated and characterized. These include Gyp6p (GAP for Ypt6), Gyp7p (GAP for Ypt7), and Gyp1p (GAP for Sec4 and Ypt1) and show no homology to Rab3 GAP (11Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D.

Novick P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3253-3256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It remains unknown whether these Rab GAPs other than Rab3 GAP consist of two subunits, because all of them have been isolated by use of the molecular biological methods. It may be important to examine whether the Rab GAPs other than Rab3 GAP consist of subunits. We also studied here the physiological function of p150, but p150 did not affect the Rab3 GAP activity of p130 or its localization in PC12 cells. It has been shown that the dominant active mutant of Rab3A, which is deficient in its ability to hydrolyze GTP, inhibits Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from adrenal chromaffin cells and PC12 cells (28Holz R.W.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In isolated nerve terminals, α-latrotoxin induces exocytosis and concomitantly increases the GDP/GTP ratio of Rab3A (30Stahl B. von Mollard G.F. Walch-Solimena C. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24770-24776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Rab3 GAP is essential for the Rab3A function in the docking and/or fusion processes. However, it remains unknown at which stage of these processes Rab3 GAP is activated to induce GTP hydrolysis of Rab3A and how Rab3 GAP is activated. We previously showed that the GTP-bound form of Rab3A, which is complexed with Rabphilin3, a downstream target of the Rab3 subfamily members (31Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), is resistant to the Rab3 GAP activity (32Kishida S. Shirataki H. Sasaki T. Kato M. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22259-22261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether either p130 or p150 interacts with Rabphilin3, but we have not yet obtained the evidence supporting this interaction (data not shown). It is possible that Rab3 GAP interacts with some other protein(s) implicated in the Ca2+-dependent exocytosis through p150 and regulates GTP hydrolysis of the Rab3 subfamily members at an appropriate time of the docking and/or fusion processes. It is of crucial importance to identify such a protein. We thank Dr. Y. Nakamura (Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Japan) for providing a human brain cDNA library. We also thank Dr. M. Shibata (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Ina, Japan) for producing the anti-p150 polyclonal antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2019637840,"The diverse biological effects of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily are believed to be mediated in part through TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), a family of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins which can activate intracellular signaling pathways, including the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. TRAFs 2, 5, and 6 strongly activate both pathways when overexpressed; however, TRAF 3 (a close homologue of TRAF 5) does not significantly activate either pathway. The current study addresses the structural basis for this difference by substituting corresponding domains of TRAF 5 into TRAF 3 and testing activation of both pathways. A small region of TRAF 5 (the first zinc finger and 10 residues of the second zinc finger) is sufficient to convert TRAF 3 into an activator of both pathways. Also, an intact zinc ring finger is required for NF-κB activation but not JNK activation. In agreement with this finding, TRAF 2A, a TRAF 2 splice variant with an altered ring finger, is a specific activator of JNK. These findings suggest that different domains of TRAFs may be involved in NF-κB and JNK signaling. Also, alternative splicing of TRAFs may represent a novel mechanism whereby TNF family receptors can mediate distinct downstream effects in different tissues."

Because plasma Vn was shown to have only one protein kinase A phosphorylation site (Ser378) but to contain ∼3 mol of covalently bound phosphate, and because human serum and blood cells were shown to contain also a casein kinase II (CKII) on their surface, we studied the phosphorylation of Vn by CKII attempting to find out whether such phosphorylation modulates Vn function, an acid test for its having a physiological relevance.

PKA was shown to be released into the blood fluid from platelets upon their activation with thrombin (24Korc-Grodzicki B. Tauber-Finkelstein M. Shaltiel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The distinct selectivity of this Vn phosphorylation by PKA and the finding that this kinase is released from the platelets in response to a key physiological (thrombin) stimulus in hemostasis suggested to us that this kinase-driven covalent modification may have a physiological regulatory importance. Support for this notion came from reconstitution experiments using Vn isolated from human plasma and a pure catalytic subunit of PKA. These experiments revealed that under the conditions existing at the locus of a hemostatic event, the phosphorylation of Vn by PKA may well take place in vivo(26Shaltiel S. Schvartz I. Korc G.B.

Moreover, we found that following this PKA phosphorylation, there is a conformational change in Vn (which was demonstrated by circular dichroism) that results in a significant reduction in the binding of Vn to the inhibitor-1 of plasminogen activators (29Shaltiel S.

Commun. 1991; 179: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) suggested to us that in vivo, Vn is most likely phosphorylated also by other protein kinase(s) besides PKA, because plasma Vn was found to contain ∼3 mol of covalently bound phosphate per mol of Vn (30McGuire E.A.

Commun. 1991; 179: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have recently shown that in vitro Vn is also a substrate for PKC, which phosphorylates it at Ser362 (again with a stoichiometry of ∼0.7 mol/mol), and subsequently attenuates the cleavage of Vn by plasmin (32Gechtman Z. Shaltiel S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, if we take together these PKA and PKC phosphorylations, they are not sufficient to account for the stoichiometry of ∼3 mol of phosphate per mol of Vn, which was determined prior to the in vitrophosphorylation of the vacant phosphorylation sites of Vn. Therefore, we assumed that in vivo, there might still be an additional kinase (and maybe more) that might phosphorylate Vn. In fact, this possibility seemed plausible on the basis of our earlier findings that (a) upon fractionation of human serum on an anion-exchange column, we identified three peaks of protein kinase activity one of which phosphorylates phosvitin (33Korc-Grodzicki, B. (1990) The Release of PKA from Stimulated Platelets and the Identification of Its Target Substrate in Plasma.

Plasma Vn is shown to be a substrate for CKII and to phosphorylate Thr50 and Thr57 (i.e.amino acid residues vicinal to the cell-adhesion RGD site of Vn (positions 45–47)). The functional consequences (and thus the possible physiological relevance) of this CKII phosphorylation is demonstrated by comparing wt-Vn to the CKII phosphorylated wt-Vn, as well as the two double mutants: T50E/T57E (a mutant representing an analog of a fully phosphorylated Vn at Thr50 and Thr57) and T50A/T57A (a mutant representing an analog of a nonphosphorylated Vn at these two positions). The adhesion of bovine aorta endothelial cells (BAECs) onto the CKII phosphorylated wt-Vn or onto its T50E/T57E mutant is shown to be enhanced (via an αvβ3integrin) in comparison to their adhesion onto the nonphosphorylated wt-Vn, as well as onto its T50A/T57A mutant.DISCUSSIONProtein phosphorylation is well established as a key mechanism for intracellular regulation. However, in the last few years, several reports provided evidence to show that phosphorylation might also function as a regulatory device in the cell exterior (for a review, see Ref. 26Shaltiel S. Schvartz I. Korc G.B. Kreizman T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These reports included evidence that protein kinases are present outside the cell as ectoenzymes (on the cell surface) or exoenzymes (detached from the cell) and that they may well have outside the cell appropriate peptide or protein substrates (24Korc-Grodzicki B. Tauber-Finkelstein M. Shaltiel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7541-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,25Korc-Grodzicki B. Tauber-Finkelstein M. Chain D. Shaltiel S. Biochem.

In addition, the occurrence of a release of ATP (a co-substrate of the kinases) into the cell exterior (56El M.C. Dornand J. Mani J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1134: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the physiological circumstances under which the kinases and their substrates become exposed to each other, and, finally, the fact that phosphorylation modulates the functional properties of some of the kinase substrates support the notion that extracellular phosphorylation may well be a physiological regulatory mechanism. For example, we have shown that Vn is functionally modulated by PKA, which is released from platelets upon their physiological stimulation with thrombin (24Korc-Grodzicki B. Tauber-Finkelstein M. Shaltiel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7541-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Korc-Grodzicki B. Tauber-Finkelstein M. Chain D. Shaltiel S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. 1993; 127: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and similarly, that PKC phosphorylation of Vn attenuates its cleavage by plasmin (32Gechtman Z. Shaltiel S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Evidence for the existence of an extracellular CKII activity was documented in several laboratories. Such kinase activity was found, for example, on epithelial cells (34Kubler D. Pyerin W. Burow E. Kinzel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4021-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 35Pyerin W. Burow E. Michaely K. Kubler D. Kinzel V. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), on neutrophils (36Dusenbery K.E. Mendiola J.R. Skubitz K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Immunol. 1991; 147: 638-650PubMed Google Scholar), on platelets (40Rand M.D. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Blood. 1994; 83: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Jenny R.J. Ehrlich Y.H. Mann K.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 704-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and on endothelial cells (38Hartmann M. Schrader J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 39Eriksson S. Alston S.J. Ekman P. Thromb.

As in the case of PKA mentioned above, it was also shown that cells release a CKII-like activity in response to thrombin stimulation (39Eriksson S. Alston S.J. Ekman P. Thromb. Res. 1993; 72: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Therefore, circulating blood proteins might well be physiological substrates for extracellular CKII. Indeed, the coagulation cofactors Va and VIII were shown to be substrates for the platelet-released CKII (40Rand M.D. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Blood. 1994; 83: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Jenny R.J. Ehrlich Y.H. Mann K.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 704-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation of fibrinogen by CKII was found to have an effect on the structure of the fibrin fibers formed after the fibrinogen cleavage by thrombin (58Martin S.C. Bjork I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 59Martin S.C. Forsberg P.O. Eriksson S.D. Thromb.

Res. 1992; 68: 467-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).In this paper, we showed (i) that Vn is a substrate for CKII; (ii) that the CKII phosphorylation of Vn is selectively targeted to two Thr residues, Thr50 and Thr57, which are vicinal to the integrin binding Arg-Gly-Asp sequence at positions 45–47 of Vn; (iii) that the CKII phosphorylation of Vn is biochemically feasiblein vivo, as it has a K m of 0.5–2 μm, lower than the Vn concentration in blood (3–6 μm); (iv) that the phosphorylation of Thr57facilitates the phosphorylation of Thr50, presumably by converting Thr50 into a more preferred site for CKII; (v) that the stoichiometry of the CKII phosphorylation of plasma-Vn reaches a plateau at ∼0.35 mol/mol), suggesting that in vivo, plasma-Vn is partially prephosphorylated (note, however, that at this stage it is not clear whether the CKII phosphorylation occurs intra- or extracellularly); (vi) that phosphorylation of Vn at positions Thr57 and Thr50 results in a significant modulation of one of its key physiological functions, cell adhesion and spreading; and (vii) that in BAECs, the enhancement of cell adhesion by the Vn T50E/T57E is mainly due to an increased affinity toward the αvβ3 receptors.The major implication of the findings reported here is that the CKII phosphorylation of Vn modulates a major physiological function of this protein, cell adhesion and spreading, and that this phosphorylation actually converts Vn from a cellular “glue” to a cellular “super glue.” The exact mechanism involved in this modulation is not clear yet. However, we assume that the CKII phosphorylation of Vn (as in many other proteins) modulates the Vn structure in a way that favors the conformation(s) that exhibits the desired biological activity. In the case of Vn, this may be an “open” conformation or a “multimeric” form of this adhesive protein. It is commonly accepted that prior to the posttranslational modification, there is an equilibrium in which a certain (probably very low) percentage of the molecules exist in this active conformation. This percentage is usually responsible for the “basal” activity of an enzyme, for example. The role of the posttranslational modification is to establish a new equilibrium in which there is a greater percentage of molecules in the “active” conformation and consequently an increased rate of cell spreading. Further work is needed to establish that this modulation occurs in vivo as a physiological means of controlling the attachment and detachment of cells, and possibly in cell migration. We do hope that this report will set the stage for such study, which may also have important clinical implications.Cell adhesion and spreading is now known to be involved in many diseases, including cancer (invasion and metastasis), thrombosis, inflammation, osteoporosis, proliferative retinopathy, etc. (61Pytela R.

Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It was found that various tumor types stop producing specific integrins or display a different population of integrins, facilitating the migration of cells that normally do not migrate, providing them with means for invasion, and promoting the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), thus giving the tumor access to the bloodstream and to nourishment (68Varner J.A.

Molecular analysis of the specific integrins involved in these pathological conditions, and elucidating the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the control of cell adhesion to the substratum, or to each other, might shed light from a new angle on these diseases and be useful in the development of new drugs to challenge them. Originally discovered as a “serum spreading factor” (1Holmes R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), vitronectin (Vn)1 is now considered an important adhesive glycoprotein in the extracellular matrix of various cells and in circulating blood (2Preissner K.T.

PKA was shown to be released into the blood fluid from platelets upon their activation with thrombin (24Korc-Grodzicki B. Tauber-Finkelstein M. Shaltiel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ram sperm C was purified and found by mass spectrometry (MS) to be ∼890 Da smaller than Cα, the predominant somatic isoform. Partial internal amino acid sequence from ram sperm C was an exact match to that of bovine Cα, but differed from the predicted sequences for the Cβ and Cγ isoforms. MS analysis of 2-nitro-5-thiocyanatobenzoic acid fragments showed that the mass difference originated in the amino-terminal region. A unique blocked amino-terminal fragment was isolated from sperm C and sequenced by a combination of tandem mass spectrometry and Edman degradation of a subfragment. The results revealed that the amino-terminal myristate and the first 14 amino acids of Cα are replaced by an amino-terminal acetate and six different amino acids in sperm C. The predicted mass difference due to these changes is 899 Da. The region of homology between sperm C and Cα begins at the exon 1/exon 2 boundary in Cα, suggesting that sperm C results from use of an alternate exon 1 in the Cα gene.

The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 is a major enzyme in cellular signal transduction and is thought to mediate most of the physiological responses to cAMP in eukaryotic cells (1Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Below a cAMP threshold concentration, PKA exists as an inactive tetramer of two catalytic and two regulatory subunits (CR2C). The two R subunits form a dimer with each protomer attaching to the substrate-binding site of a C subunit. Some isoforms of R also associate with binding proteins collectively termed PKA anchoring proteins; it is believed that through these interactions PKA is targeted to specific subcellular compartments (for reviews, see Refs.2Dell'Acqua M.L.

Activation of adenylate cyclase by extracellular signals raises the intracellular concentration of cAMP, and at a certain threshold concentration cAMP binds to the R subunits of the PKA tetramer, releasing C to phosphorylate its substrates (for reviews, see Refs. 1Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholarand 5Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

Cyclic AMP-dependent signaling has an important role in the control of sperm movement. Mammalian sperm are nonmotile in the testis, but as they pass through the epididymis they acquire the capacity for motility. This process is known as “epididymal maturation” and is essential for the sperm to fertilize an egg (9Yanagimachi R. Zygote. 1994; 2: 371-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Several types of studies have shown that changes in sperm cAMP levels are involved in epididymal maturation (see Refs. 10Garbers D.L. Kopf G.S. Adv. Nucleotide Res. 1980; 13: 251-306PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hoskins D.D. Brandt H. Acott T.S. Fed. Proc. 1978; 37: 2534-2542PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tash J.S. Means A.R. Biol. Reprod. 1983; 28: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar for reviews). The most direct evidence for a role of cAMP in the acquisition of the capacity for motility has come from studies of demembranated, reactivated sperm (13Mohri H. Yanagimachi R. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 127: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Yeung C.H. Gamete Res. 1984; 9: 99-114Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Ishijima S. Mohri H. J. Exp. Biol. 1985; 114: 463-475PubMed Google Scholar). When caudal epididymal or ejaculated sperm were demembranated by treatment with nonionic detergents, and then placed in an appropriate solution containing ATP, they were reactivated with a waveform very similar to that of intact ejaculated sperm. In contrast, under the same conditions demembranated testicular sperm exhibited very poor motility. However, if cAMP was added to the reactivation medium, the demembranated testicular sperm began to beat with a motility similar to that of the mature sperm models. Cyclic AMP-dependent motility also could be demonstrated in the demembranated ejaculated sperm if the sperm were metabolically inhibited to reduce their motility prior to demembranation (16Lindemann C.B. Cell. 1978; 13: 9-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17San Agustin J.T. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1994; 27: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The requirement for cAMP could be bypassed by addition of exogenous C to the reactivation solution, confirming that cAMP was acting via PKA (17San Agustin J.T. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1994; 27: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation is critical for sperm motility. Sperm C (Cs) appears to have unusual solubility properties. It is generally accepted that, in the presence of cAMP, C is soluble in the cytoplasm (1Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 18McIlhinney R.A.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, in a previous study we observed that neither detergent nor cAMP alone released C activity from demembranated sperm, but that cAMP plus nonionic detergent did release the activity (17San Agustin J.T. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1994; 27: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These results suggested that Cs is bound to internal sperm structures by two types of bonds, one sensitive to detergent and one sensitive to cAMP. There are at least three different isoforms of mammalian C, Cα, Cβ, and Cγ, which are the products of different genes. Cα occurs in a wide variety of tissues (19Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15360-15363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); Cβ also is widely distributed but is expressed in lesser amounts than Cα in most tissues except the brain (19Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C.

Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cα appears to be the predominant isoform in mammalian germ cells (22Øyen O. Myklebust F. Scott J.D. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Biol Reprod. 1990; 43: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Splice variants of both Cα and Cβ also are known (23Thomis D.C. Floyd-Smith G. Samuel C.E. J. Biol.

We now have further characterized Cs and investigated its relationship to the previously known isoforms of C. We found that Cs is the major, and perhaps the only, PKA catalytic subunit in sperm. We isolated Cs from ram sperm, which could be obtained in amounts sufficient for protein biochemistry. Purification also was aided by the solubility properties of the subunit, which made it possible to obtain a homogeneous preparation of Cs by a simple two-step protocol. Mass spectrometry (MS) revealed that the mass of Cs was ∼890 Da less than that of C from ovine striated muscle. The amino terminus of Cswas blocked, but partial amino acid sequence from internal tryptic and CNBr fragments was an exact match to the sequence of bovine Cα. Cs clearly differed in sequence from the Cβ and Cγ isoforms. An amino-terminal endoproteinase lysine-C fragment was isolated from Cs and sequenced by a combination of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and Edman degradation of an endoproteinase aspartate-N subfragment. The results revealed that the amino-terminal 14 amino acids and amino-terminal myristate of Cα are replaced by six different amino acids and an amino-terminal acetate in Cs. The predicted mass difference due to this replacement is 899 Da, in excellent agreement with the MS data. The region of homology between Cs and Cα begins at exactly the exon 1/exon 2 boundary in Cα, suggesting that Cs results from the use of an alternate exon 1 in the Cα gene. The shorter amino terminus and lack of a myristate moiety may expose a hydrophobic portion of the catalytic core of Cs, allowing Cs to bind to a hydrophobic site within the flagellum and thus accounting for the unusual solubility properties of the subunit. Materials used and their sources were: 4-aminobenzamidine, cAMP, CNBr, 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and NTCB from Aldrich;14C-methylated protein molecular weight markers were from Amersham; Aquapore RP-300 C8 column (0.1 × 25 cm), Aquapore OD-300 C18 column (1 × 100 mm), and C18 300 A column (0.5 × 150 mm) from Applied Biosystems; Tween 20 and SDS from Bio-Rad; endoproteinase aspartate-N from Boehringer Mannheim; bovine serum albumin (fatty acid free), hydrogenated Triton X-100, β-octylglucoside from Calbiochem; guanidine hydrochloride and urea from ICN; Immobilon P (PVDF) transfer membranes, 0.45 μm, from Millipore; [γ-32P]ATP from NEN Life Science Products Inc; CM Fast Flow, Source 15S, from Pharmacia LKB; endoproteinase lysine-C and modified trypsin from Promega; nitrocellulose BA 83, 0.2 μm, from Schleicher and Schuell; alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (A3937), Amido Black, ammonium bicarbonate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium-buffered tablets, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, DTT, E-64, leupeptin, pepstatin, poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1, PKA catalytic subunit (bovine or porcine heart), PKI(5–24), Ponceau S, TLCK, and TPCK were from Sigma; DE52 was from Whatman. All chemicals for automated Edman degradation sequencing and peptide synthesis were from Applied Biosystems/Perkin Elmer. Water and acetonitrile for HPLC separations were from EM Science. Polyclonal antibody to bovine C was a gift from Dr. Brian A. Hemmings (Friedrich Miescher-Institut, Switzerland). Ejaculated sperm were collected and washed as described earlier (26San Agustin J.T. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1993; 24: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Epididymis and testis were obtained from a freshly killed ram. Epididymal sperm was collected by retrograde extrusion of the epididymal contents with wash buffer (27Babcock D.F. First N.L. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6488-6495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extruded sperm were then washed as described for the ejaculated sperm. To collect testicular sperm, a testis was minced, suspended in wash buffer, and the suspension filtered twice through cheesecloth. The filtrate containing testicular sperm was transferred to 15-ml polypropylene tubes and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 20 min (Model CL Clinical Centrifuge, IEC). The supernatant was removed and the sperm pellet was washed and centrifuged again as above. The sperm concentrations were determined using a hemacytometer. The flagella were isolated using a modified version of an earlier procedure (28San Agustin J.T. Witman G.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 47: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). About 6 ml of ejaculated ram semen (sperm density 3–4 × 109/ml) were collected and washed. The sperm density was adjusted to 1.5 × 109/ml with the wash buffer to yield about 12 ml of sperm suspension. Three-ml aliquots of the washed sperm were transferred to 50-ml polypropylene tubes, each containing 9 ml of chilled phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm4-aminobenzamidine, 10 μm E-64, 4 mm EDTA, 15 μm pepstatin, 100 μm TLCK, 200 μm TPCK, 4 mm DTT, 20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.5) (PBSI). Subsequent steps were done at 4 °C. The sperm suspension in each tube was sonicated on ice (Branson Sonifier Model 200 fitted with a 3-mm double-stepped microtip) using four 10-s continuous pulses with a power setting of 25% (37.5 watts). The above sonication conditions produced about 70% sperm decapitation. The flagella were separated from heads and residual whole sperm by centrifugation at 4 °C in a discontinuous sucrose gradient as described earlier (28San Agustin J.T. Witman G.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 47: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) except that the bottom 2.2 m sucrose layer was omitted. The sonicated sperm (48 ml) were stirred into 108 ml of 2.2 m sucrose and 13-ml aliquots were pipetted into 32-ml polycarbonate centrifuge tubes each containing 19 ml of 2.05m sucrose. The tubes were centrifuged at 72,000 ×g for 1.5 h (Beckman SW 28 rotor). Heads and whole sperm pelleted at the bottom of the tube while the flagella collected at the 1.5–2.05 m sucrose boundary. The isolated flagella were transferred to 12-ml thick-walled polypropylene tubes, diluted 1:2 with PBSI, and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min (Sorvall SS 34 rotor). The pellets were resuspended in PBSI, and the concentration of the flagellar suspension determined using a hemacytometer. Usually about 10 × 109 flagella were obtained from 6 ml of ram semen. Isolation of sperm heads was as described (28San Agustin J.T. Witman G.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 47: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Two passes through the sucrose gradient were done to make sure that the preparation was free of flagella and undecapitated sperm. Ovine ejaculated sperm were demembranated as described earlier (26San Agustin J.T. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1993; 24: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Isolated sperm heads and flagella were treated the same way except that flagella were separated from the demembranation medium by centrifugation through 40% Percoll, and heads were separated from the demembranation medium by centrifugation through 70% Percoll. Samples were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (10% glycerol, 3% SDS, 0.03% bromphenol blue, 50 mm DTT, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and then electrophoresed in a 1.5-mm thick gradient gel (5–15% acrylamide, 12 × 14 cm). Protein kinases were renatured on the blot and detected using a protocol adapted from Ferrell and Martin (29Ferrell Jr., J.E. Martin G.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and described earlier (30San Agustin J.T. Witman G.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 47: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 1% poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1, a tyrosine kinase substrate, was used as blocking solution in place of 5% bovine serum albumin. Samples were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, electrophoresed in 0.75-mm thick 10% minigels (4.5 × 8 cm), and blotted to PVDF membranes (TE 22 transfer apparatus, Hofer Scientific, 28 V for 5 min followed by 84 V for 20 min). The transfer buffer composition was 50 mm Tris base, 192 mmglycine, 20% methanol, and 0.01% SDS. After transfer, the membrane was blocked with TBS-Tween 20 (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 20 min, incubated with anti-bovine C (in TBS-Tween 20, 1:200 dilution) for 1 h, then washed four times (5 min each wash) with 200 ml of TBS-Tween 20. Incubation with the secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG in TBS-Tween 20, 1:800 dilution) was for 1 h, followed by washing twice, 10 min each wash, with 200 ml of TBS-Tween 20. Final wash was 200 ml of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min. The blot was then exposed to 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (1 tablet dissolved in 10 ml water) to reveal cross-reacting proteins. Extraction was done at 4 °C. Sperm flagella (in PBSI) were centrifuged (1750 × g, 15 min) and resuspended for 30 min in a Triton X-100/NaCl buffer (5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.5%, v/v, Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25 μm leupeptin, 1 mmDTT), at a concentration of 3 × 108 flagella/ml. This treatment removed the plasma membrane and most of the soluble flagellar proteins that otherwise would coextract with Cs upon subsequent treatment with cAMP; Cs itself remained bound to the demembranated flagella. 2J. T. San Agustin and G. B. Witman, unpublished results.The suspension then was centrifuged (1750 × g, 30 min), the supernatant discarded, and the pellet dispersed in KPNELD wash buffer (5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25 μmleupeptin, 1 mm DTT, 0.22 ml of buffer/108flagella) and centrifuged (1750 × g, 10 min). This was repeated with 0.167 ml of buffer/108 flagella. The washed pellet was then extracted for 20 min with KPNELD + 10 μmcAMP, 0.167 ml/108 flagella. The cAMP extract, which contained Cs, was transferred to a polypropylene tube that had been treated with Triton X-100 to minimize nonspecific binding of Cs, and then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min to remove residual flagella. The cAMP extract was made 0.2% (w/v) in β-octylglucoside and applied at 0.3 ml/min flow rate to a CM Fast Flow column (0.5 × 5 cm) previously equilibrated with chilled buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1%, w/v, β-octylglucoside, 1 mm DTT). The column was washed with buffer A until the absorbance, which rose due to cAMP in the extract, returned to baseline. The column was eluted with 7 ml of a cold linear NaCl gradient of buffer A plus buffer B (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1%, w/v, β-octylglucoside, 1 mm DTT) at 0.2 ml/min flow rate. Cs was detected in fractions between 180 and 215 mm NaCl. Yield was typically 20–25 μg/6 ml of semen. β-Octylglucoside was included in the buffers to prevent nonspecific binding of Cs to the glass column, tubings, and tubes, as well as to stabilize the native conformation of Cs(31Okuno S. Fujisawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The procedure was adapted from Okuno and Fujisawa (31Okuno S. Fujisawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) for the isolation of bovine heart C. Working at 4 °C, about 600 to 800 g of skeletal muscle tissue from the hind legs and back of a ram were stripped of fat and connective tissue and then passed through a meat grinder (coarse setting). The ground tissue was mixed with 1.5 liters of homogenization buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT) and further processed to a smooth consistency in a Waring blender. The homogenized mass was then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant was collected, filtered through glass wool, and applied to a packed DE52 column (5 × 15 cm) equilibrated with the homogenization buffer. About 8 liters of wash buffer (55 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmDTT) were then passed through the column, followed by about 2 liters of the DE52 equilibration buffer (45 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1%, v/v, Tween 20). The PKA holoenzyme was bound to the DE52 resin; Csm was released by washing with DE52 equilibration buffer containing 100 μm cAMP. DE52 sequestered cAMP, so that Csm was eluted only after about twice the bed volume of the elution buffer was applied. The fractions containing Csmwere identified by SDS-PAGE, and then applied to a CM Fast Flow column (1 × 8.5 cm, equilibrated with DE52 equilibration buffer). The column was washed with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) β-octylglucoside, 1 mm DTT and then subjected to a linear salt gradient of 50 mm to 300 mm NaCl (total volume of gradient, 50 ml; flow rate 0.4 ml/min). Csmeluted between 160 and 280 mm NaCl. The resulting Csm preparation was about 95% pure, with a yield of about 400 μg of Csm/600 g of skeletal muscle. It was made 40% in glycerol and stored at −20 °C. Homogeneous Csm was obtained by applying an aliquot of the glycerol-stabilized preparation (2–3 ml, 40–60 μg of Csm) to a Source 15S column (0.5 × 5 cm, equilibrated with buffer A) and eluting with a linear NaCl gradient (buffer A plus buffer B, total volume of 7 ml, flow rate 0.4 ml/min). Csm eluted as a sharp peak between 250 and 265 mm. All HPLC separations were carried out on a modified Hewlett-Packard HP1090 m system equipped with a UV photodiode array detector with a 1.7-μl microflow cell. For 20 μl/min flow rates an LC packing Accurate Microflow splitter was used. Automated Edman degradations were performed on an Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer 494 Procise sequencing system. MALDI TOF MS was performed on a Perseptive Biosystems linear Voyager BioSpectrometry Workstation. Electrospray MS/MS was performed using a Perkin-Elmer Sciex API 365 benchtop triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with MicroIonSpray and the BioToolBoxTM software package. Product ion MS/MS experiments were carried out using nitrogen as the dissociating gas at a collision cell pressure of 2.2 × 10−3 torr and a collision energy of 40 eV. Scans were obtained in the positive-ion mode from m/z 30 to 1500 with a step size of 0.25 atomic mass units and a dwell time of 0.75 ms. In order to increase sensitivity, the first MS was operated using low resolution (full width, half-height ∼ 3 atomic mass units). Additionally, samples were infused at a flow rate of 200 nl/min using the MicroIonSpray source, thus allowing 140 scans to be signal averaged to improve signal-to-noise ratio. Cs was blotted onto PVDF membrane as described above (see “Western Blotting”). The membrane was cut into small pieces (1 × 1 mm) and submerged under 50 μl of Digest Buffer (10% acetonitrile, 1% hydrogenated Triton X-100, 100 mmammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.2). One μg of trypsin in 4 μl of 50 mm acetic acid was added to the sample, which was then incubated overnight at 37 °C followed by direct injection of the supernatant onto the HPLC. Tryptic peptides were separated on a 1-mm × 25-cm Applied Biosystems (Aquapore RP-300) C8column using a linear gradient from 100% solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to 55% solvent B (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile/water: 70/30) in 30 min, then from 55% solvent B to 85% solvent B in 10 min at a flow rate of 150 μl/min. The eluent was monitored at 210 nm and fractions were collected manually. For electrophoretic analysis of fragments, about 2 μg each of Csm and Cs in 50 μl of buffer A were lyophilized. To each lyophilized sample was added 12.5 μl of 100 mm DTT, and the mixture then was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h. To start the cleavage reaction, 37.5 μl of 47 mm CNBr (in 88% formic acid) were added. The reaction mixture was incubated overnight (about 19 h) at room temperature in the dark. To stop the reaction, 100 μl of water was added and the resulting solution was lyophilized to remove the formic acid and unreacted CNBr. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of water and lyophilized again, and afterward 15 μl of SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, 5% SDS, 0.003% bromphenol blue) was added to the lyophilized sample. The sample was electrophoresed in a 0.75-mm thick 13% Tris-Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel (32Schägger H. Link T.A. Engel W.D. von Jagow G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar); the gel was silver stained to reveal the fragments. For sequencing of fragments, the starting sample contained about 10–15 μg of C. The cleavage products were separated by electrophoresis in a 1.5-mm gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane according to the protocol of Otter et al. (33Otter T. King S.M. Witman G.B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), except that the transfer time was shortened from 17 to 12 h. The blot was stained with Amido Black and the fragments excised and sequenced. The procedure was adapted from Jacobson et al. (34Jacobson G.R. Schaffer M.H. Stark G.R. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6583-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of Csm and Cs (in fresh buffer A) was adjusted to 40 μg/ml and 50 μl of each was then lyophilized. The dried samples were redissolved in 125 μl of denaturation buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 8.5, 8.1m urea) and allowed to stand for 30 min at room temperature. A 15-μl aliquot of freshly prepared NTCB (66.5 mm) was added and allowed to react for 20 min. The amount of NTCB added gave about a 10-fold excess of NTCB over the combined sulfhydryl groups of DTT (present in buffer A) and Csm or Cs (presumed to be two, as with bovine Cα). NTCB (15 mg) was first dissolved in 0.333 ml of ethanol and then made up to 1 ml with the denaturation buffer. The pH of the reaction mixture after the addition of NTCB was about 8.4. The cleavage reaction was initiated by the addition of 4.8 μl of 1 n NaOH, which brought the pH up to about 11.6. The reaction was allowed to proceed for about 16 h. The mixture was then transferred to a Centriplus 10 concentrator (Amicon) and washed with buffer A until the urea and excess NTCB were reduced about 3000-fold and the final volume was reduced to about 200 μl. The concentrate was then mixed with an equal volume of 2 × Schägger sample buffer and electrophoresed in a 10% Tris-Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel (32Schägger H. Link T.A. Engel W.D. von Jagow G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The fragments were revealed by silver staining. Preparation of NTCB fragments for mass spectrometry was the same, except that 30 μg each of Csm and Cs were used as starting material. The Tris-Tricine gel was transferred to nitrocellulose (33Otter T. King S.M. Witman G.B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) at 28 V for 5 min and then at 84 V for 20 min. The bands were revealed by staining with Ponceau S and then cut out for MALDI TOF MS. Csm and Cs were blotted on nitrocellulose which was then cut into 1 × 1-mm pieces and submerged under 50 μl of Digest Buffer. An aliquot of endoproteinase lysine-C (0.5 μg in 0.5 μl of 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) was then added and the samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C followed by direct injection of the supernatant onto the HPLC. Endoproteinase lysine-C peptides were separated on a 0.5 × 150-mm Applied Biosystems column (C18, 300 A) using a linear gradient from 100% solvent A to 46% solvent B in 35 min, then from 46% solvent B to 60% solvent B in 10 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The eluent was monitored at 210 nm and fractions collected manually. The blocked amino-terminal peptide isolated from the endoproteinase lysine-C digest of Cs was dissolved in 25 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and 0.12 μg of endoproteinase aspartate-N in 3 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added. Digestion proceeded overnight at 37 °C. The digested peptide was desalted in a C18 microcartridge (0.8 mm × 5 mm, LC packing, San Francisco, CA) prior to direct application to Edman sequence analysis. Four peptides were synthesized in order to compare their MS/MS product ion spectra to the MS/MS pro"

Human phagocyte flavocytochrome b (Cytb)1 is an electron transferase that directs metabolic electrons across the plasma membrane to reduce molecular oxygen and form superoxide (O⨪2). The production of superoxide by phagocytes, which involves modulation of Cyt b structure, is essential for antimicrobial host defense (1Roos D. de Boer M. Kuribayashi F. Meischl C. Weening R.S. Segal A.W. Ahlin A. Nemet K. Hossle J.P. Bernatowska-Matuszkiewicz E. Middleton-Price H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1663-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), plays a central role in inflammatory tissue injury (2Jesaitis A.J. Quinn M.T. Mukherjee G. Ward P.A. Dratz E.A. New Biol. 1991; 3: 651-655PubMed Google Scholar), and may play a more general role in cellular regulation (3Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clearmont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). Individuals with a defective Cyt b have insufficient superoxide production, suffer from chronic granulomatous disease (4Dinauer M.C. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1993; 30: 329-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and sustain repeated life-threatening infections (5Smith R.M. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1991; 77: 673-686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its cardinal role in many inflammatory processes and possibly in growth regulation, few experimental methods have been able to provide information on the structure of Cyt b. Therefore, we have developed an alternative method to describe topological features of the Cytb surface. Because antibodies and their cognate antigens form complementary surfaces of interaction (6Janeway Jr., C.A. Travers P. Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease. 1996; (:1–3:42, Current Biology, Ltd./Garland Publishing, Inc., London): 3Google Scholar), we have sought structural information about Cyt b from an antibody binding site, specific for the Cyt b surface. We recently reported mapping of monoclonal antibody epitopes and functional sites of Cyt b, using random sequence phage-display peptide libraries (7;8). mAb 44.1 recognizes Cyt b in situ in permeabilized human neutrophils and thus contains information about the three-dimensional structure of the protein surface. Phage bound by mAb 44.1 display sequences that implicate the 183PQVNPI188 region of p22 as at least part of the epitope bound by mAb 44.1(7). Our current results, obtained using a more sensitive colony-lift method of immunological screening of phage sequences, suggest that mAb 44.1 also recognizes the 29TAGRF33 segment of p22. By including both peptide segments into one contiguous synthetic construct separated by flexible glycine residues, as suggested by phage mapping, we were able to determine the conformation of the bound structure at low resolution by transferred NOESY and transferred ROESY NMR. Our results show the combined application of phage-display random peptide epitope mapping and NMR analysis of specific epitope peptides bound to the antibody recognition sites can provide new structural information about conformational epitopes of large proteins. Colony-lift screening is the replica blotting of bacterial colonies onto nitrocellulose and developing the replica in a similar fashion as a Western blot. This procedure was carried out by infecting K91 cells with affinity-purified J404 phage library members and growing them as isolated colonies on Luria broth/kanamycin agar. The colonies were then blotted to nitrocellulose for 5 min, the blots were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and probed with 2 μg/ml mAb 44.1 for 2 h at room temperature, washed, and developed with secondary antibody and chromogen (9Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1995Google Scholar). Signals on the blots were used to locate corresponding colonies that were used to inoculate individual cultures for nucleotide sequence analysis as described (10Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). A mutant phage, which expressed the ATAGRFGGG peptide sequence on the amino terminus of the pIII protein, was constructed by using two complementary oligonucleotides, 5′-ctctcactccgctaccgcgggccgttttggcggcggcgtggaaagttgt-3′, and 5′-ctttccacgccgccgccaaaacggcccgcggtagcggagtgagagtaga-3′. The oligonucleotides were phosphorylated and allowed to anneal under conditions previously described (11Cwirla S.E. Peters E.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The insert was then ligated to the M13KBst (12Burritt J.B. Bond C.W. Doss K.W. Jesaitis A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) vector in a molar ratio of 1:2.5 for vector:insert, respectively. The ligation product was then transfected into electrocompetent MC1061 cells and plated on a lawn of K91 cells to produce isolated plaques. The relevant nucleotide sequence of resulting clones was determined (13Meeker A.K. Li Y.-K. Shortle D. Stites W.E. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 370-372PubMed Google Scholar) to verify the intended mutations. ELISA analysis was used to determine the ability of synthetic peptides to mimic the putative epitope regions of p22 when bound by mAb 44.1. Seventy-five μl of a wheat germ agglutinin:N-acetylglucosamine solution (0.4 mg/ml:2 mm) was adsorbed to a Dynex Immulon 2 plate for 3 h at 4 °C. Unbound protein was removed with four rinses of wash buffer (2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4)). Human neutrophil membranes served as a source of Cyt b, which were extracted with octyl glucoside according to a previous protocol (14Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), except the membrane resuspension buffer lacked dithiothreitol and EDTA. Thirty μl of octyl glucoside extract (containing ∼5 ng of Cytb) was then added to each rinsed well and incubated overnight at 4 °C, prior to washing as above, except 0.1% Triton X-100 was included in the wash. Seventy-five μl of mAb 44.1 (final concentration 200 ng/ml) was then exposed to the immobilized Cytb in the presence of various dilutions of synthetic peptides as shown in Fig. 2. The antibody remaining after four rinses of wash buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 was measured with an anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The signals were developed with a standard ABTS-hydrogen peroxide reagent and measured at 405 nm. NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker DRX 500 instrument at 5 and 25 °C, in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5 or 5.0), in the presence of 5% D2O, as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The TAGRFGGGQVGPP peptide was 1 mm,and the mAb 44.1 was either 47 or 84 μm. The interproton distances in the peptide complexed with mAb 44.1 were estimated by comparison with the cross-peak intensity of the F5:Hβ protons, which are 1.8 Å apart. To obtain structural imprint information about Cyt bfrom mAb 44.1, we extended phage-display epitope mapping of the mAb recognition site (7Burritt J.B. Quinn M.T. Jutila M.A. Bond C.W. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16974-16980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). From a pool of mAb 44.1-immunoreactive phage-displayed peptides, colony-lift screening (see “Experimental Procedures”) was used to select avidly binding sequences that most closely resemble the epitope bound by mAb 44.1. Of approximately 500 colonies of Escherichia coli infected by different mAb 44.1-selected phage clones, 22 (4%) were found to produce distinctly darker staining replica signals (represented by signals in Fig. 1 A; I = darker, and II = lighter). The unique peptide displayed on phage associated with each colony type was deduced by nucleotide sequence analysis. Peptides expressed by the light-staining II-type phage were found to belong to the PX 1VX 2P motif (whereX 2 ≠ R if X 1 = Q) and contained from two to four residues matching the183PQVNPI188 sequence of p22, as shown previously (7Burritt J.B.

Peptides associated with the more strongly staining I-type colonies segregated into two groups according to their sequences (Table I). Sequences 1–3 in Table I (AQPQVRPIG, NMPQVRPID, and DRPQVRPIL) each contained the six-residue sequence, PQVRPI, 2These sequences, revealed only by colony-lift screening, were included in the list of sequences given in Ref. 7Burritt J.B.

The second group of phage-expressed peptides giving strongly staining colony-lift signals (sequences 4–7 in Table I) included 19 clones bearing four unique sequences and suggested the new consensus, TAGRFGGGQV(GPP) (sequence 10 in Table I). The GPP tether residues in this sequence are not part of the variable region of these clones (12Burritt J.B. Bond C.W. Doss K.W. Jesaitis A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), but are shown because they may also be recognized in part by mAb 44.1. This new consensus epitope contains the TAGRF and GGGQV(GPP) sequence segments, which are similar to the 29TAGRF33and 183PQVNPI188 regions of p22, respectively (Table I). Two of these individual phage peptides: 4, EGRFGGGQV(GPP) and 5, ISRFGGGQV(GPP), were identical in seven of the nine randomized positions and sequence 4 was found in 14 clones (64%) selected in this way.Table ISummary of analysis of mAb 44.1 epitopep22 sequences......175-AAGGPPGGPQVNPIPV-190.........28-ATAGRFTQW-36....Phage-display:Clones1AQPQVRPIG12NMPQVRPID13DRPQVRPIL14EGRFGGGQVGP P145ISRFGGGQVGP P16TR-RHRGGQVGP P17TA-RHAGGQVGP P3ELISA and NMREC50μm8PQVRPI0.5809ATAGRFGGPQVNPI1.810 TAGRFGGGQVGP P15011PQVNPI30012ATAGRFTQW31013PGPFGQTGAVGRG>100014 KNNLKDCGLF>1000Western blotReactivity1AQPQVRPIG+++4EGRFGGGQVGP P+++15ATAGRFGGG+M13KBst vector−Identical residue matches to selected phage sequences are shown in bold.Clone, peptide, or sequence number referred to in text.The proline of the constant GPP tether that may be bound by mAb 44.1 is italicized.Tr-NOESY and Tr-ROESY NMR analyses performed on indicated sequence.Scrambled consensus sequence.Irrelevant peptide.

Irrelevant peptide. The immunoreactivity of mAb 44.1 with phage-expressed peptides resembling each of the two different putative epitope moieties of p22 was supported using semiquantitative Western blots probed by mAb 44.1. All lanes of the Western blot in Fig. 1 Bcontain ∼1010 phage plaque-forming units differing only by the sequence of their displayed peptides. In lanes b and c, strong signals were observed at the molecular weight corresponding to the phage pIII protein bearing either the AQPQVRPIG or EGRFGGGQV(GPP) peptides (1 and 4, respectively, Table I). These sequences were derived from darkly staining type I colonies. Phage displaying peptides that mimicked the putative29TAGRF33 epitope moiety alone were not selected from the library, presumably because this sequence has relatively low affinity for mAb 44.1 when it occurs without the PQVNPI region of the epitope. To determine whether mAb 44.1 can indeed recognize the TAGRF sequence expressed on the pIII protein of the M13 phage, a clone displaying the ATAGRFGGG sequence (sequence 15, Table I) was created (see “Experimental Procedures”) and probed by mAb 44.1 as shown in lane a of Fig. 1 B. A weak but detectable signal suggests at least part of the ATAGRFGGG polypeptide is bound by mAb 44.1. No signal is observed in lane dcontaining the pIII protein of the M13KBst (12Burritt J.B. Bond C.W. Doss K.W. Jesaitis A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) vector with no peptide insert, showing that the constant region of the molecule is not recognized by mAb 44.1. The ability of phage-discovered peptides to substitute for the native cytochrome b epitope was quantitated by their ability to compete for the antibody combining site in an ELISA shown in Fig. 2. Component peptides examined in ELISA analyses (ac-PQVNPI-amide and ac-ATAGRFTQW-amide, 11 and 12, respectively, in Table I) were identical to the183PQVNPI188 and28ATAGRFTQW36 regions of p22. The composite peptide (ac-ATAGRFGGPQVNPI-amide, sequence 9, Table I) was identical to a combination of these two regions, representing both in a contiguous linear sequence (Table I). The consensus peptide sequence 10 (ac-TAGRFGGGQVGPP-amide), suggested by colony-lift-selected phage clones 4–7, was tested as was the ac-PQVRPI-amide sequence (sequence 8) that was strongly represented by clones 1–3. The peptides tested all demonstrated well behaved competition curves suggestive of specific interaction up through the millimolar concentrations needed for the NMR experiments described below. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of these peptides in the ELISA are listed in Table I. The composite sequence of p22 ATAGRFGGPQVNPI (sequence 9 in Table I), representing both epitope regions, was greater than 100-fold more inhibitory toward mAb 44.1 binding to Cyt b than either half of the epitope (peptides 11 and 12 in Table I). The strikingly lower IC50 for the composite peptide relative to the component epitope peptides strongly supports the participation of both regions of p22 in the binding site for mAb 44.1 on Cyt b. Interestingly, the non-native peptide sequence PQVRPI, where arginine replaces the native asparagine 186, demonstrated an even higher (580 nm) avidity for the mAb, indicating the importance of arginine in this region of the epitope. The consensus peptide (TAGRFGGGQVGPP, 10 in Table I) from phage-display has a binding affinity (K d = 150 μm) for mAb 44.1, which is in a suitable range for study of the antibody-bound conformation of the peptide by transferred-NOESY (Tr-NOESY) NMR (15Ni F. Prog. NMR Spectroscopy. 1994; 26: 517-606Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 16Campbell A.P. Sykes B.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 99-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The free peptide evidently has little or no persistent structure in solution in the absence of the antibody, as evidenced by two-dimensional NOESY NMR shown in part in Fig. 3 A, showing cross-peaks only within amino acid side chains and between nearest neighbor residues. Upon addition of antibody, the bound peptide develops NOESY signals while it is bound, which persist when the peptide exchanges into solution, as shown in the section of the Tr-NOESY NMR spectrum in Fig. 3 B at pH 6.5. The intensity of the Tr-NOESY signals depends on the amount of antibody added and the fraction of peptide bound to the antibody, supporting specificity of binding at the high peptide concentrations needed (data not shown). In all, 68 NMR constraints were observed in the bound peptide, eight of which are long range, involving residues separated in the primary structure by three to four other residues (Table II). Of the remaining 60 NOEs (data not shown), 21 involved adjacent residues and 39 were within residue NOEs, many of which provided information on side chain conformation.Table IImAb 44.1-bound peptide NOE constraintsResidues involved in cross-peaksNOE distances in angstromLower limitUpper limit8 long range NOEs (1–8) 1.

Open table in a new tab Indicates that pseudoatoms were used in the structure determination, since the two or three protons at the sites denoted were not resolved or not resolved separately. Upon addition of antibody 44.1, the Tr-NOESY shows increases in cross-peak intensities involving residues Arg4, Phe5, Gln9, and Val10, indicating that these residues are immobilized upon binding to the antibody. These same residues, corresponding to 32RF33 and184QV185 of p22, are abundantly represented in the phage-displayed peptides 1–7 in Table I. Fig. 3 B and Table II show long range cross-peaks among immobilized residues, which are widely separated in the primary sequence of the peptide, supporting a folded conformation of the peptide when bound to mAb 44.1. Long range cross-peaks, which indicate the association between F5:ring and V10:H γ protons in the peptide when bound to mAb 44.1, are denoted with an asterisk in the Tr-NOESY spectrum (Fig. 3 B). Within the resolution limits of the Tr-NOESY experiments, no medium range i to i+ 2, or i to i + 3 were observed (data not shown), arguing against helices or tight turns in the modeled structure. The short range i to i + 1 cross-peaks were included in simulated annealing calculations modeling the bound structure that suggested a folded peptide with a broad open bend centered around Gly7 and Gly8 and a close proximity (3–5 Å) between Phe5 and Val10. When the additional phage display constraint suggesting juxtaposition of Asn186 and Arg32 side chains of p22 was included in the calculation, the peptide maintained its general folded conformation with minimal structural violations. A higher resolution model of this epitope will be the subject of a future report. When ligands are bound to macromolecules it is possible that Tr-NOESY cross-peaks between ligand protons can be mediated by macromolecule protons that are in intimate contact with the ligand (17London R.E. Perlman M.E. Davis G.D. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1992; 97: 79-98Google Scholar, 18Jackson P.L. Moseley H.N. Krishna N.R. J. Magn. Reson. Ser.

Ser. B. 1993; 101: 262-270Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Rotating frame Overhauser enhancement (Tr-ROESY) experiments can be used to distinguish direct ligand-ligand proton interactions (two spin interactions) from interactions that are mediated indirectly by third protons (three spin interactions), since the three spin contributions have opposite signs in NOESY and ROESY (21Fejzo J. Zolnai Z. Macura S. Markley J.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 82: 518-528Google Scholar). Cross-peaks indicating long range interactions between peptide protons in Tr-NOESY (Fig. 3 B) are weaker, but still present in Tr-ROESY (Fig. 3 C), and so the major portion of the Tr-NOESY intensity is due to direct interaction between ligand protons. The Tr-NOESY cross-peak intensities observed are due to a sum of the bound peptide and free peptide signals when the exchange rate of the ligand off the macromolecule is fast, relative to the fastest cross-relaxation rate of the bound ligand (22Landy S.B. Rao N. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 81: 371-377Google Scholar). At pH 6.5 and 5 °C the consensus peptide was found to be in relatively slow exchange by the spin-lock power dependence of the T1ρ relaxation (23Davis D.G. Perlman M.E. London R.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 104: 266-275Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and the one-dimensional NMR spectrum of the peptide was not substantially broadened by kinetic exchange with the antibody (data not shown). To increase the exchange rate of the peptide with the antibody, the pH was lowered to 5, and the temperature was raised to 25 °C. The proton NMR line widths of the free peptide (Fig. 4 A) increased in the presence of the antibody (Fig. 4 B), indicating faster exchange of the peptide with the antibody binding site. The shifts of peptide peaks upon binding to the antibody and the increase in line width indicate that the approximate off rate is about 70 s−1 at pH 5 and 25 °C, which is over 10 times faster than the fastest bound cross-relaxation rate (∼5.4 s−1). All the cross-peaks previously identified at pH 6.5 are present under the faster exchange rate conditions. Antibodies that bind native proteins contain topological information about the protein surface structure, in the form of a three-dimensional imprint. Because many epitopes bound by antibodies involve residues that are surface-accessible, but not necessarily contiguous in the polypeptide chain, their resolution can reveal important structural data about the protein. Phage-display peptide libraries have proven a useful source of epitope analogs (12Burritt J.B. Bond C.W. Doss K.W. Jesaitis A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and therefore provide a tool in antibody binding site analysis. The ability to apply NMR to confirm structures of phage-derived amino acid sequences, when bound by the antibody, enables structural models of protein epitopes to be constructed. Our colony-lift data suggested two widely separated regions of the p22 polypeptide might both participate in the epitope bound by mAb 44.1, implying the antibody recognizes an epitope in the folded protein. The mAb 44.1 binds to Cyt b in permeabilized cells (7Burritt J.B. Quinn M.T. Jutila M.A. Bond C.W. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16974-16980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and so recognizes the native Cyt b structure. The mAb 44.1 does not inhibit oxidase function (data not shown) and so does not perturb its structure in functionally important ways. ELISA analysis was used to measure the ability of synthetic peptides to compete with mAb 44.1 binding to octyl glucoside-solubilized Cyt b. This detergent-solubilized form of Cyt b retains its native heme spectrum (24Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 932: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and can be reconstituted with exogenous FAD to produce a functional protein capable of generating superoxide by itself (25Koshkin V. Pick E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or in complex with other neutrophil proteins (26Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our ELISA data provide evidence for synergistic binding affinities of mAb 44.1 to the composite peptide sequence (ATAGRFGGPQVNPI) relative to the component sequences (ATAGRFTQW and PQVNPI), supporting the existence of both protein segments in the mAb 44.1 epitope (Fig. 5). Tr-NOESY (16Campbell A.P. Sykes B.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 99-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (15Ni F. Prog.

B. 1995; 106: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) NMR experiments were performed on the consensus TAGRFGGGQVGPP (sequence 10) peptide to study its molecular conformation when bound to mAb 44.1 and to test conclusions drawn from the phage-display analysis. Tr-NOESY analysis could not be carried out on peptide 9 (ATAGRFGGPQVNPI), which more closely resembled both regions of Cyt b, because under the conditions investigated it was bound too tightly by mAb 44.1. The consensus peptide (peptide 10) showed both sufficient affinity and off-rate for NMR analysis, under the conditions used. The long range NOEs in Fig. 3 and in Table II indicate that upon binding to mAb 44.1, a globally folded structure is conferred upon the TAGRFGGGQVGPP peptide. The similarities between the Tr-NOESY and the Tr-ROESY (Fig. 3, B and C, respectively) show that mediation of cross-relaxation between peptide protons by antibody protons is not the major source of cross-peak intensity in the peptide Tr-NOESY. A decrease in the Tr-ROESY cross-peak intensity between two protons relative to the TR-NOESY cross-peak is likely to be due to antibody protons mediating NOESY cross-relaxation of the peptide protons (29Arepalli S.R. Glaudemans C.P.J. Daves D.G. Kovac P. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1995; 106: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The ability to adjust the off-rate of the peptide with the antibody by lowering the pH and increasing the temperature allows the adjustment of the off-rate (Fig. 4, A and B) so that a structure with additional reliability can be determined. Such studies are under way using a fluorine-substituted peptide to obtain more accurate off-rate measurements (30Gizachew D. Dratz E.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 74aGoogle Scholar). Our results imply that the ATAGRF segment of the consensus ATAGRFGGPQVNPI sequence is folded back upon the PQVNPI region to bring Phe5 and Val10 to less than 5 Å of one another, and hence place the positively charged arginine residue in close proximity to the carboxyl half of the peptide. The importance of an arginine in this vicinity would explain the repeated recovery of phage-expressed peptides containing an arginine in the consensus, PQVRPI, and the failure to obtain phage peptides containing an asparagine in this position, as it exists in the183PQVNPI188 p22 segment (7Burritt J.B. Quinn M.T. Jutila M.A. Bond C.W. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16974-16980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The importance of arginine in this region is further demonstrated by ELISA, in the 600-fold higher binding effectiveness of mAb 44.1 to PQVRPI compared with the PQVNPI peptide (Fig. 2). Because arginine is not found in the native183PQVNPI188 segment of p22, the occurrence of this residue in the epitope could well be satisfied by the arginine in the 29TAGRF33 region of the protein if it were located close to Asn186 in the native folded protein, as suggested by the phage-display mapping. The Tr-NOESY and Tr-ROESY data on the TAGRFGGGQVGPP peptide bound to mAb 44.1 (Fig. 3 B) corroborates this concept by indicating the arginine side chain of the bound peptide is oriented close to the QV residues, perhaps across a cleft of the folded peptide. The potential to determine the approximate positions of noncontiguous amino acids on the surfaces of folded proteins appears to be a capability of peptide combinatorial libraries and thus a strength of phage-display peptide library analysis (31Scott J. Smith G. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The approach we present, where mAbs directed against surface structures of integral membrane proteins in situ are used to probe random peptide libraries and the mAb-bound structures of the selected peptide sequences are studied by Tr-NOESY and Tr-ROESY NMR, provides visualization of an imprint of the surface structure of the membrane protein antigen. Such imprint analysis may provide a new approach for studying the surfaces of proteins and thus aid in the modeling of intermolecular interactions for which traditional structural data are unavailable. In summary, the data presented in this report indicate that regions of an integral membrane protein, separated by membrane-spanning domains, can be shown to be associated in an epitope that exists in the native form of the protein. Future applications of this approach promise to provide more detailed three-dimensional information about native conformations of integral membrane proteins."

These proteins converge in such a way as to promote processive synthesis in both leading and lagging strands. In organisms as diverse as bacteriophages, bacteria, yeasts, and humans, the components that characterize a processive replicating machine are quite similar. In the case of E. coli, γ complex, using ATP, loads β subunit onto DNA. The β clamp, fully encircling the DNA molecule, associates with core and holds it firmly in place so extension of the primer can proceed. Because lagging strand synthesis is discontinuous, a cycling of the proteins upon completion of each Okazaki fragment to a new primer is required; therefore, periodic loading of β is essential for replication of the genome to continue. Duplication of genomic DNA in E. coli requires processive DNA replication activity of the 10-subunit DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme consists of three main functional units: the core polymerase, the β sliding clamp, and the γ complex clamp loader (reviewed in Refs. 1McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19127-19130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholarand 2Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The three subunits distinctive to E. coli DNA polymerase III core (3McHenry C.S. Crow W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1979; 254: 1748-1753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11785-11791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The core, by itself, is not processive. It is capable of synthesizing short segments of DNA but dissociates readily from the primer/template, extending the primer only 10–20 nucleotides per binding event in vitro(8Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β sliding clamp and the γ complex are accessory proteins, the presence of which converts this nonprocessive component into an apparatus that synthesizes thousands of nucleotides per binding event (4Maki H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis by x-ray diffraction has shown that the β subunit is a ring-shaped dimer that has a central hole, with an inner diameter of about 35 Å, large enough to encircle duplex DNA (10Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The γ complex is a multisubunit clamp loader composed of two γ subunits and one each of the δ, δ′, χ, and ψ subunits (11Maki S. Kornberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6555-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence has established a mechanism by which the γ complex acts to assemble β onto DNA, wherein β acts as a sliding clamp, tethering the core polymerase to the DNA molecule. Techniques for studying the mechanism of the γ complex-catalyzed reaction have been confined to observing their assembly on large circular single-stranded DNA, such as bacteriophage templates, or by combining the components and observing their association using gel filtration and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To further characterize the pathway of clamp assembly, we used fluorescence depolarization to measure the change in anisotropy of a short primer/template labeled with a fluorescent probe, rhodamine-x. The rotational motion of the DNA is dependent on its molecular weight and is slowed when proteins are bound; therefore, the change in fluorescence anisotropy of the labeled p/t1 DNA is a measure of the interactions between the γ complex, β, and DNA. The β clamp is a stable dimer in solution due to the presence of several hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts at the dimer interface between the two monomers. The γ complex must break these contacts to open the ring, and therefore, the nature of the β dimer interface likely plays an important role in the ATP-coupled process of clamp assembly on DNA. We have found that mutation of the hydrophobic residue Leu273 to Ala or mutation of Leu108 to Ala at the dimer interface yields β clamps that can assemble on DNA but inhibit the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the γ complex. Steady state and pre-steady state measurements of the protein-DNA interactions indicate a corresponding inhibition in the dissociation of γ complex from the β·DNA complex. Results with ATPγS, using wt β, substantiate the β mutant study, indicating that in the absence of ATP hydrolysis, release of γ complex from β·DNA is blocked. Thus, we show that β can be loaded onto DNA in the presence of ATP; however, ATP hydrolysis is required to release the clamp loader from the clamp completing the clamp loading process. Subunits of the γ complex were overexpressed and purified as described: γ (13Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), δ, δ′ (14Dong Z. Onrust R. Skangalis M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11758-11765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), χ, and ψ (15Xiao H. Crombie R. Dong Z. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11773-11778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The γ complex was reconstituted from purified subunits as described (12Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the dnaN gene was achieved producing an L273A mutant β protein and an L108A mutant β protein. Wild type β and β mutants were overexpressed and purified as described (16Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme reaction buffer contained 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 8 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry on an Applied Biosystems synthesizer (model 392 RNA/DNA) and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fluorescent measurements were done using the following primer/template sequence:5′ CT GGT AAT ATC CAG3′ TCT TCT TGA GTT TGA TAG CCG GAACGA CCA TTA TAG GTCAAC AAT ATT ACC GCC A 3′TTG TTA TAA TGG CGG TCG GTA ACG TTG TCC TTT TTG CGA GT 5′SEQUENCE 1 The 80-mer template was labeled at the 5′-end with rhodamine-x (Molecular probes, catalog no. X-491) to which the 30-mer primer was annealed (17Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A QuantaMaster QM-1 fluorometer (Photon Technology International) with a single emission channel (L format) was used to measure steady state anisotropy. Samples were excited with vertically polarized light (Oriel dichroic sheet polarizer) at 580 nm (8-nm band pass), and both vertical and horizontal emission was monitored at 610 nm (8-nm band pass). Three individual anisotropy measurements were taken for each sample, and the values were averaged to compensate for manual rotation of the polarizer. The G factor was determined, and its value was used to calculate anisotropy. Steady state experiments were performed in a 1-cm path cuvette by measuring the initial anisotropy of 54 nm p/t DNA (labeled with rhodamine-x) in 186 μl of reaction buffer containing ATP. A 4-μl aliquot of 20 μm β dimer and a 10-μl aliquot of 4 μm γ complex were added, and anisotropy measurements were taken after each addition of protein. The final concentrations were 50 nm p/t DNA, 400 nm β dimer, 200 nm γ complex, and 500 μm ATP. The mixture was allowed to stand for 15 min (>15 min for mutants) at room temperature after which the anisotropy was measured again. One final anisotropy measurement was taken after the addition of a 2-μl portion of 45 mm ATP. The procedure was performed a second time; however, the γ complex and β dimer were added in reverse order. A mixture of 66 nmp/t DNA, 533 nm β dimer, and 666 μm[α-32P]ATP was incubated in a 45-μl total volume of reaction buffer. In an additional tube, an 800 nm mixture of γ complex in reaction buffer was prepared. The solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. Reactions were initiated by adding a 15-μl aliquot of the γ complex solution to the 45-μl tube containing β, p/t DNA, and [α-32P]ATP. Final concentrations were 50 nm p/t DNA, 400 nm β dimer, 200 nm γ complex, and 500 μm[α-32P]ATP. An 8-μl aliquot was removed at 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 min and quenched with an 8-μl portion of a 10% SDS, 40 mm EDTA mixture. Labeled ATP was separated from labeled ADP by spotting 1-μl aliquots on silica gel sheets (Kodak chromagram) and developing with an 11:7:2 NH4OH:isopropanol:water solution. The radiolabeled reactants and products were detected and quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Stopped-flow anisotropy measurements were performed using T-format instrumentation as described (18Otto M.R. Lillo M.P. Beechem J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2511-2521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Three syringes on the stopped-flow apparatus were filled with the appropriate component. Typically, one syringe contained protein in reaction buffer, the second syringe contained DNA in reaction buffer, and the third syringe contained reaction buffer alone. Reactions were initiated by combining a 100-μl aliquot of protein solution with a 100-μl aliquot of DNA solution in the mixing chamber. Fluorescence measurements were made by exciting the sample at 580 nm with vertically polarized light and simultaneously collecting the vertically and horizontally polarized emission components through a 600-nm cut on filter. To increase the signal to noise ratio, multiple runs (5Scheuermann R. Tam S. Burgers P.M. Lu C. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The anisotropy of control preshot reactions was determined by mixing 100 μl of DNA with 100 μl of reaction buffer. Two reactions were performed. In the first reaction, 100 nm p/t DNA, 800 nm β dimer (or β mutants), and 500 μm ATP in reaction buffer were placed in one syringe. The second syringe contained 600 nm γ complex and 500 μm ATP in reaction buffer. Control preshots contained 50 nm p/t DNA, 400 nm β (or β mutants), and 250 μm ATP. In the second reaction, syringe 1 contained 100 nm p/t DNA and 500 μm ATP in reaction buffer, and syringe 2 contained 800 nm β (or β mutants), 600 nm γ complex, and 500 μm ATP in reaction buffer. Control preshots contained 50 nm p/t DNA and 250 μm ATP in reaction buffer. The first syringe contained 100 nm p/t DNA, 800 nmβ dimer, 600 nm γ complex, and 2 mm ATP in reaction buffer. The second syringe contained 500 nm M13 “trap” DNA in reaction buffer. M13 trap DNA consisted of single-stranded DNA from wild type M13 with two 30-nucleotide primers annealed at different sites. The pre-steady state experiments were performed as described above except that ATPγS was used in place of ATP. In the first experiment, one syringe contained 100 nm p/t DNA, 800 nm β dimer, and 500 μm ATPγS in reaction buffer, and the second syringe contained 600 nm γ complex and 500 μm ATPγS in reaction buffer. In the next experiment, the first syringe was filled with 800 nm β dimer, 600 nm γ complex, and 500 μm ATPγS in reaction buffer. The second syringe was filled with 100 nmp/t DNA and 500 μm ATPγS in reaction buffer. Two different chase experiments were performed. In the first experiment, one syringe was filled with 400 nm β dimer, 300 nm γ complex, 50 nm p/t DNA, and 500 μm ATPγS in reaction buffer, and the second syringe contained 5 mm ATP in reaction buffer. In the second experiment, one syringe was filled with 400 nm β dimer, 300 nm γ complex, 50 nm p/t DNA, and 500 μm ATP in reaction buffer. The second syringe contained 5 mm ATPγS in reaction buffer. The γ complex-catalyzed reaction of loading β onto DNA was analyzed directly in solution using steady state fluorescence depolarization, a technique measuring the rotational diffusion of a fluorophore (19Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 145-147Google Scholar). In these experiments a fluorescent probe, rhodamine-x, was covalently attached to DNA, and the fluorescence anisotropy of the probe on DNA was measured. Because the diffusion rate of free DNA is greater than that of DNA bound by proteins, the fluorescence anisotropy of the DNA probe will directly report on the association of proteins with DNA (20LeTilly V. Royer C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7753-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 21Perez-Howard G.M. Weil P.A. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8005-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A decrease in the rate of rotation, due to protein binding, will result in an overall increase in steady state anisotropy. In all equilibrium and pre-steady state anisotropy experiments, the total intensity signal was examined and found to be absolutely invariant under all experimental conditions (data not shown). Hence, all observed anisotropy changes reflect the rotational property of p/t DNA and not any other photophysical effect. These results are consistent with our previous time-resolved fluorescence measurements using the same system (17Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For a recent review on the use of fluorescence anisotropy for protein-DNA interactions, see Heyduk et al. (22Heyduk T. Ma Y. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Interactions between proteins and DNA were analyzed under steady state conditions for clamp loading activity and also under pre-steady state conditions to observe formation of the protein-DNA complex in real time. For anisotropy measurements, a 30-nucleotide primer was annealed to an 80-nucleotide template labeled at the 5′-end with a fluorescent probe, rhodamine-x. The primer was placed in the center of the 80-mer, leaving single-stranded segments, each 25 nucleotides in length, at both ends of the template. This 30/80-nucleotide primer/template combination was shown to be the minimum size for DNA to still support processive synthesis by the core polymerase in the presence of both the γ complex and the β dimer (17Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The loading of wt β and β mutants onto DNA was measured under steady state conditions using titration experiments. The proteins were added to DNA in a specific order to determine how each constituent affects the fluorescence anisotropy of the DNA probe. Labeled p/t DNA (50 nm), ATP (500 μm), and buffer containing Mg2+ were placed in a cuvette, and the anisotropy of the p/t DNA was determined. Two types of titration experiments were performed. In the first (Figs. 1 A and 2, A and C) β (400 nm) was added to p/t DNA prior to the addition of γ complex (200 nm), and in the second (Figs. 1 Band 2, B and D) γ complex was added to DNA prior to β. Anisotropy measurements were taken following the addition of each protein. The results of these experiments were previously shown for wt β in a publication by Bloom et al. (17Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) but were repeated in this work to compare the results of wt β with the two β mutants.Figure 2Increase in steady state anisotropy for rhodamine-x-labeled DNA when γ complex loads β mutants on DNA.A reaction identical to that outlined by the sketch at the top of Fig. 1 was followed to measure steady state anisotropy for the mutants except wt β was replaced with L273A mutant β and L108A mutant β.A, the anisotropy of rhodamine-x-labeled p/t DNA (DNA) was measured. The anisotropy of this DNA solution was measured again after adding a small aliquot of L273A mutant β (Beta). The γ complex (Gamma) was then added, and the anisotropy was again measured. The anisotropy measurement was repeated after 15, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 105 min followed by one additional reading after the addition of ATP (ATP).B, conditions were identical to those in A except that γ complex was added before L273A mutant β. C, the steady state anisotropy of p/t DNA (DNA) was measured. A small aliquot of L108A mutant β (Beta) was added, and the anisotropy was again measured. An anisotropy measurement was again taken after the addition of γ complex (Gamma). The reaction was allowed to stand for 15, 45, and 60 min, and the anisotropy was measured after each period of time. Following the addition of ATP, the anisotropy measurement was repeated. D,conditions were identical to those in C except that γ complex was added before L018A mutant β. The final concentrations in each reaction described above were 50 nm p/t DNA, 400 nm β, 200 nm γ complex, and 500 μm ATP. In either case, both γ complex and β are required to increase the anisotropy levels to 0.26 and 0.28 for the L273A mutant β and the L108A mutant β, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When wt β or β mutants were added to p/t DNA, the anisotropy did not increase significantly over the initial value of approximately 0.16 (Figs. 1 A and 2, A and C). A substantial transition occurred, however, when γ complex was added to the reaction, increasing the anisotropy values from 0.16 to 0.25 for wt β, 0.26 for L273A mutant β and to 0.28 for L108A mutant β (Figs. 1 A and 2, A and C). To determine whether the increases in anisotropy were caused by the association of γ complex with p/t DNA, the order in which the β dimer and γ complex were added was reversed. Addition of the γ complex to p/t DNA resulted in a small increase in anisotropy from 0.16 to 0.17 (Figs. 1 B and 2, B and D), but the large anisotropy increases did not occur until either wt β or the β mutants were added (Figs. 1 B and 2, B and D). These data demonstrate that an increase in anisotropy for rhodamine-x-labeled p/t DNA requires the presence of both the γ complex and the β dimer, but they do not answer the question of which proteins are bound to DNA, β by itself or the γ complex and β. It has been shown, however, that after the γ complex loads β onto DNA, β alone remains bound to the DNA molecule (9Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These initial results indicate that the β mutants are capable of interacting with the γ complex and p/t DNA in the same manner as wt β. One noticeable observation is that anisotropy increases for rhodamine-x-labeled p/t DNA in the presence of the γ complex and β mutants were slightly larger (0.26 for L273A and 0.28 for L108A) than when in the presence of γ complex and wt β (0.25). Following the addition of γ complex and wt or mutant β to p/t DNA, the reactions were incubated for 15 min. During this 15 min incubation, the anisotropy of wt β dropped to a value of 0.17, a value close to that of free p/t DNA (Fig. 1, A and B, 15 min). In contrast, when reactions with β mutants were incubated for 15 min essentially no decreases in anisotropy were observed (Fig. 2,A–D, 15 min). For the L273A mutant, the anisotropy remained at 0.26 for approximately 60 min and decreased to a value of only 0.24 after 105 min. This value is still well above the level of 0.16 for free p/t DNA (Fig. 2, A and B). For L108A mutant β, it took approximately 1 h for the anisotropy to decrease to a value of 0.21 (Fig. 2, C and D). In reactions with both the wt and mutant βs, when additional ATP was added, the anisotropy values once again increased (Figs. 1 and 2, ATP). The fact that addition of fresh ATP restored high anisotropy values indicates that the fraction of p/t DNA bound by protein is due to the utilization of ATP and can be restored if ATP is replenished to a depleted reaction. In the absence of ATP, there was no association of β or γ complex with p/t DNA (data not shown). For reactions with wt β, the increased anisotropy values following the addition of β and γ complex to p/t DNA actually represent a steady state population of bound protein that is cycling on and off the DNA (see kinetic experiments described below). In each cycle, β is loaded onto DNA in a reaction that requires hydrolysis of ATP; it then dissociates from DNA or is removed by the γ complex to once again be loaded at the expense of more ATP. For reactions with the β mutants, a much longer period of time is required before depletion of ATP, suggesting that this cycling reaction is significantly slower than that for wt β. To investigate whether ATP was being hydrolyzed by the γ complex at slower rates in the presence of the β mutants than with wt β, ATPase assays were performed. Rates of ATP hydrolysis were measured using [α-32P]ATP, the product of which, after hydrolysis, was analyzed by separating hydrolyzed ADP from ATP using thin layer chromatography and quantitating the separated fractions on a PhosphorImager. The β dimer (400 nm), p/t DNA (50 nm), [α-32P]ATP (500 μm), and buffer with Mg2+ were combined. The reaction was initiated by adding the γ complex (200 nm). Aliquots were removed at 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 min and then quenched using a solution of SDS and EDTA. Previous studies have shown that γ complex ATPase activity is stimulated by DNA and is stimulated further in the presence of both DNA and β (23Burgers P.M.J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11468-11473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Burgers P.M.J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11474-11478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Onrust R. Stukenberg P.T. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21681-21686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have performed ATPase assays under conditions identical to the DNA binding anisotropy experiments. Rates of ATP hydrolysis were measured in reactions with γ complex alone; γ complex and p/t DNA; and γ complex, p/t DNA, and wt β. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was very slow for γ complex alone, 0.4 μmol-min−1 (Fig. 3). The ATPase rate was stimulated 10-fold by addition of DNA into the reaction (4.3 μmol-min−1), indicating an interaction between γ complex and DNA (Fig. 3); and finally, addition of β further stimulated the rate of ATP hydrolysis 30-fold over the basal ATPase rate of γ complex alone (12 μmol-min−1) (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that γ complex, β, and DNA participate in an ATP-utilizing process. The ATP consumption for β alone was negligible (data not shown). The DNA-dependent steady state rates of ATP hydrolysis by γ complex were 1.5 μmol-min−1 and 6.2 μmol-min−1 in the presence of the L273A mutant β and L108A mutant β, respectively (Fig. 4). The DNA-dependent γ complex ATPase rate is 8-fold faster when in the presence of wt β than when in the presence of L273A mutant β and 2-fold faster than when in the presence of L108A mutant β. In fact, the DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis rate for γ complex alone is 3-fold higher than when L273A mutant β is added to the reaction. These results correlate well with anisotropy data, which suggest that ATP consumption is much slower in reactions with β mutants than in reactions with wt β (Fig. 2). Real time measurements of γ complex-catalyzed loading of wt β and β mutants onto p/t DNA were obtained using stopped-flow fluorescence anisotropy. In these experiments, real time changes in the steady state anisotropy of rhodamine-x-labeled p/t DNA were measured during the rapid mixing of DNA and proteins. For the reaction shown in Scheme 1 (Fig. 5), one stopped-flow syringe was loaded with wt or mutant β (800 nm), p/t DNA (100 nm), ATP (500 μm), and buffer containing Mg2+. A second stopped-flow syringe was loaded with γ complex (600 nm), ATP (500 μm), and the same buffer with Mg2+. Reactions were initiated by delivering equal volumes of the contents of the two syringes to a cuvette, in which fluorescence was measured. For the reaction shown in Scheme 2 (Fig. 5), the first syringe was loaded with p/t DNA (100 nm), ATP (500 μm), and buffer with Mg2+, and the second syringe was loaded with β (800 nm), γ complex (600 nm), ATP (500 μm), and buffer with Mg2+. Reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes of reagents from each syringe. For both reactions, multiple runs (at least five) were summed to increase the signal to noise ratio, and the raw anisotropy data were fit to a sum of exponential terms. The total intensity of signals during these reactions was completely invariant (data not shown). Reaction time courses for stopped-flow anisotropy measurements of γ"
https://openalex.org/W1985349036,"The small GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (ARF1) regulates intracellular transport by modulating the interaction of coat proteins with the Golgi complex. Coat protein association with Golgi membranes requires activated, GTP-bound ARF1, whereas GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by an ARF1-directed GTPase-activating protein (GAP) deactivates ARF1 and results in coat protein dissociation. We have recently cloned a Golgi-associated ARF GAP. Overexpression of GAP was found to result in a phenotype that reflects ARF1 deactivation (Aoe, T., Cukierman, E., Lee, A., Cassel, D., Peters, P. J., and Hsu, V. W. (1997) EMBO J. 16, 7305–7316). In this study, we used this phenotype to define domains in GAP that are required for its function in vivo. As expected, mutations in the amino-terminal part of GAP that were previously found to abolish ARF GAP catalytic activity in vitro abrogated ARF1 deactivation in vivo. Significantly, truncations at the carboxyl-terminal part of GAP that did not affect GAP catalytic activity in vitro also diminished ARF1 deactivation. Thus, a noncatalytic domain is required for GAP activity in vivo. This domain may be involved in the targeting of GAP to the Golgi membrane. The small GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (ARF1) regulates intracellular transport by modulating the interaction of coat proteins with the Golgi complex.

ADP-ribosylation factor endoplasmic reticulum GTPase-activating protein. The initial stage of transport vesicle formation, termed budding, is driven by the association of cytoplasmic coat proteins with the cytoplasmic face of the donor organelle membrane. The interaction of coat proteins with membranes is regulated by members of the ARF1 subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins in multiple cellular compartments (1Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 2Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 3Schekman R. Orci L.

In the early secretory pathway, which includes the ER and the Golgi complex, the ARF1 protein regulates the interaction of a coat protein complex termed COPI with organelle membrane (4Donaldson J.G.

Uncoating requires GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 (12Donaldson J.G. Kahn R.A. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Science. 1991; 254: 1197-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 13Tanigawa G.

Thus, the GTPase cycle of ARF1 drives vesicular transport through the regulation of vesicle budding and vesicle fusion. The uncoating of transport vesicles must be controlled to prevent the premature dissociation of coat protein before the completion of vesicle budding. To gain an understanding of the molecular basis of the uncoating process, we have purified and cloned an ARF-directed GAP from rat liver (15Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J.

Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The GAP was found to distribute between cytosol and the Golgi complex. The catalytic domain of the GAP was localized to the amino-terminal part and was found to include an essential Cys4 zinc finger structure. Our studies of the cellular role of GAP showed that overexpression of the protein in mammalian cells induces the release of COPI from Golgi membranes to cytosol and the redistribution of the entire Golgi complex to the ER (17Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because this phenotype had been shown previously to result from deactivation of ARF1 (18Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar, 19Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.D. Klausner R.D. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our findings indicate that GAP fulfills its expected role as a negative regulator of ARF1 at the Golgi. In this study we carried out a structure-function analysis of the GAP molecule to identify domains that are required for its functionin vivo. Because measurement of the GTPase cycle of ARF1in vivo is complicated by the unstable nature its GTP-bound form (21Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we used the previously defined phenotype of ARF1 deactivation for our structure-function analysis. The findings reveal that the in vivo activity of GAP requires not only the catalytic domain that is responsible for stimulating GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 but also a noncatalytic domain. As the substrate of GAP (GTP-bound ARF1) is membrane-associated, one function of the noncatalytic domain may be the targeting of cytosolic GAP to specific sites at the Golgi membrane. [α32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol) was from New England Nuclear. Recombinant, myristoylated ARF1 was prepared from bacteria coexpressing ARF1 and N-myristoyltransferase as described in (21Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that induction of protein expression was carried out at 27 °C to increase the efficiency of protein myristoylation (22Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Vent DNA polymerase was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). COS7 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 40 μg/ml gentamycin under a 5% CO2atmosphere. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GAP antibody was prepared as described (16Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar); mouse monoclonal antibody against giantin (kindly provided by H.P. Hauri); mouse monoclonal antibody 7G7 against Tac antigen (provided by D. Nelson, Bethesda, MD); mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 against the myc epitope; mouse monoclonal antibody against 6 × His (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA); fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine or Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA); peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma); peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Bio Yeda, Rehovot, Israel). cDNAs encoding GAP and its mutants were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers with extensions containing HindIII and XbaI restriction sites for sense and antisense primers, respectively. The products were cloned into the respective sites of the mammalian expression vector pECE. Translation of all constructs is initiated from the ATG of the GAP cDNA and is terminated by either primer or vector-introduced stop codons. To introduce an amino-terminal polyhistidine track, cDNAs were cloned between the BamHI and KpnI sites of the pQE30 vector (Qiagen products, Valencia, CA) and then transferred to pECE. These vectors introduce an amino-terminal extension of Arg-Gly-Ser-His6. GAP with a carboxyl-terminal extension of myc/His6 tags was expressed in the pcDNA 3.1(−)/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) after cloning between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the vector. Transfection of COS7 cells was done by electroporation using a modification of the method of Chu et al. (23Chu G. Hayakawa H. Berg P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1311-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in growth medium to give 2–5 × 106 cells/ml. To 400 μl of cell suspension in a 4-mm electroporation cuvette was added 10 μg of DNA. Electroporation was carried out by a pulse at 960 microfarads, 260 V, and infinite internal resistance. The cells were immediately plated in a 10-cm-diameter culture dish. The medium was changed after 16 h, and the cells were used for experiments 40 h after transfection. HeLa cells were transfected by the standard calcium phosphate method. Cells were grown to 60–70% confluency on glass coverslips. Cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature, then treated with cold methanol for 1 min. Cells were incubated with anti-GAP and anti-giantin antibodies (1:2,000 and 1:1,000 dilutions, respectively) in PSS (phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.2% saponin, and 15 mm sodium azide) for 1 h, then washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate and either rhodamine or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (respectively) in PSS for 1 h. Coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount G. Microscopy was performed with 60× oil lens in a Bio-Rad MCR-1024 confocal microscope. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gels) and transferred to nitrocellulose paper. The blots were incubated with polyclonal anti-GAP antibodies (1:10,000 dilution) followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and were developed by ECL. Transfected cells were lyzed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin,10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated with antibody-coupled protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed and treated with sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblotting. This assay was done as described previously (17Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were cotransfected with the Tac-E19 and GAP constructs, labeled 24 h later with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine by a 2 h pulse, then chased for 16 h. Cells were lyzed, immunoprecipitated with anti-Tac antibody coupled to protein A, treated (or mock-treated) with endoglycosidase H, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Proteins were purified from cells that were transfected with GAP cDNAs encoding an amino-terminal hexahistidine extension. Cells grown in a 10-cm dish were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lyzed by adding 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 1% hydrogenated Triton X-100, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation in the microfuge for 10 min. The NaCl concentration in the lysates was increased to 0.5 m, and imidazole was added to give 10 mm. The combined lysate from two dishes was incubated with 60 μl (packed volume) of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (from Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% hydrogenated Triton X-100, and 10 mm imidazole, then washed twice with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.5m NaCl, 0.05% hydrogenated Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 250 mm. The eluate was supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol, and the pH was increased to 8.0 by the addition of 1 m Tris, pH 8.5. Previous structure-function analysis of GAP suggested that its catalytic domain is localized at the amino-terminal portion that includes an essential Cys4 zinc finger structure encompassing amino acids 22–45 (16Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the catalytic domain of GAP in vivo, we tested the effect of mutations in this domain on the ability of overexpressed GAP to induce a phenotype of ARF1 deactivation (17Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to monitor the integrity of the Golgi complex using the Golgi membrane protein giantin as a marker (24Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, cells overexpressing wild-type GAP did not display the characteristic perinuclear staining of the Golgi complex. By contrast, cells overexpressing GAP mutants in which there was either a deletion of the entire zinc finger (GAP64–415) or the zinc finger was inactivated by a mutation in one of its scaffold cysteines (C22A), the Golgi complex appeared intact in most cells. These findings indicate that these mutants are inactive in vivo, as might be anticipated from their inability to stimulate GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 in vitro(16Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This conclusion was substantiated by quantitative analysis of the expression and activity of GAP and its mutants. As shown in Fig. 2 A, approximately 90% of cells overexpressing wild-type GAP did not show a Golgi structure by immunofluorescence. The GAP64–415 mutant was completely inactive, whereas the C22A mutant caused an apparent disassembly of the Golgi in a minor fraction of the cell population. Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 B) showed that GAP and its mutants displayed the expected size and were expressed at comparable levels. Thus the difference in the abilities of wild-type and mutant GAP to induce Golgi disassembly is unlikely to result from differences in levels of protein expression.Figure 2Quantitative assessment of the expression and activities of GAP and its catalytically inactive mutants. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with vector alone (Cont), wild-type GAP (WT), and the two catalytically inactive mutants, GAP64–415 and C22A. A, cells were fixed and double-labeled as described in Fig. 1. Cells overexpressing the various constructs were counted (at least 200 cells in each sample), and the percentage of cells with disassembled Golgi complexes is shown. B, equivalent amounts of lysate from cells transfected with various constructs were immunoblotted with anti-GAP antibody. KD, kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To screen for a potential role of other parts of GAP in its activity in vivo, we generated a series of truncated proteins and tested their ability to induce Golgi disassembly (Fig. 3). In a previous study we found that a polypeptide that includes the first 146 amino acids (of 415 in the complete protein) shows GAP catalytic activity in vitro, whereas a polypeptide that includes the first 257 amino acids is as active as tissue-purified protein (16Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Significantly, however, this truncated GAP (GAP1–257) did not effectively induce a phenotype of ARF1 deactivation, as assessed by Golgi disassembly (Fig. 3 A). In comparing mutant GAPs that are serially truncated from the carboxyl terminus, overexpression of a mutant with a relatively small truncation (containing the first 359 of 415 residues of GAP) induced Golgi disassembly nearly to the same extent as wild type GAP. Further truncations of GAP from the carboxyl terminus, generating mutant GAPs that contained 335 amino acids or less, resulted in a significantly reduced ability of GAP to induce Golgi disassembly (Fig. 3 A). Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 B) showed that the expression level of the truncated mutants was 1.5–2.5-fold lower than the expression level of wild-type protein. However, when corrected for transfection efficiency, which varied between 8 and 18%, the expression level per cell was similar for all mutants (data not shown), suggesting that the difference in the ability of different GAP mutants to induce Golgi disassembly was not due to differences in the level of expressed proteins. Thus, together with the findings on amino-terminal mutants of GAP (Figs. 1 and 2), the results on carboxy truncation mutants suggested that GAP function in vivorequired not only its catalytic domain but also part of the noncatalytic domain. In view of the rather unexpected finding that carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants retaining the GAP catalytic domain are ineffective in vivo, we sought to confirm the findings by a different approach. As Golgi redistribution to the ER is the most specific manifestation of the phenotype of ARF1 deactivation, we had previously established a biochemical assay to measure this parameter in a quantitative fashion (17Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This assay measures the glycosylation pattern of the ER glycoprotein Tac-E19, which becomes endoglycosidase H-resistant after mixing of Golgi with ER due to its processing by Golgi glycosidases. Using this approach, we found that both wild-type GAP and the mutant containing the first 359 amino acids induced endoglycosidase H resistance of Tac-E19 to a similar extent. However, the shorter carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants showed similarly reduced activity in this assay (Fig. 4,A and B). Western blotting revealed that all mutants were expressed at least as well as the wild-type form (Fig. 4 C). Thus, these results were similar to those obtained by assessing Golgi disassembly through a morphologic approach that examined the fate of the Golgi marker giantin by immunofluorescence microscopy. To gain further insight into the function of the noncatalytic domain of GAP, we investigated the intracellular localization of carboxyl-terminal GAP mutants. Immunofluorescence examination of such mutants (GAP1–257and GAP1–277) showed a diffused distribution throughout the cell (Fig. 5). By contrast, the zinc finger mutant C22A that is a full-length protein but is catalytically inactive showed intense perinuclear staining that was colocalized with that of the Golgi marker giantin in most cells. However, for reasons that are unclear at present, the distribution of the C22A mutant in a minority of cells overlapped only partially with that of giantin (an example of each pattern is shown in Fig. 5). These findings suggest that the catalytically inactive mutant is capable of localizing correctly to the Golgi complex, similar to the endogenous GAP (16Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), whereas the carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants seem to have lost this capacity. This mislocalization could account, at least in part, for the low in vivo activity of the carboxyl-terminal mutants. Next, we sought to rule out possible competing explanations for our interpretation of the inactivity of carboxyl-terminal mutants in vivo. Even thoughin vitro assays showed that bacterially expressed GAP1–257 has similar catalytic activity as that of tissue-purified protein, we first sought to rule out that the reduced activity of GAP1–257 in vivo reflects a reduced catalytic activity of the protein when overexpressed in the mammalian cell. For this purpose, both wild-type GAP and GAP1–257were tagged with a hexahistidine in their amino termini. As assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy, the tag did not seem to affect GAP function in vivo, because tagged wild-type GAP was still able to effectively induce the phenotype of ARF1 deactivation, whereas tagged GAP1–257 showed reduced activity similar to that of the nontagged protein (data not shown). Overexpressed proteins were then purified from COS cells by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. When assayed for GAP catalytic activity in vitro, both wild-type and truncated proteins showed similar dose dependence for their ability to stimulate GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 (Fig. 6). It is therefore unlikely that the differential activity of wild-type GAP and GAP1–257 is due to a difference in their catalytic activity. Interestingly, the protein concentration that was required for half-maximal GAP activity of the proteins purified from COS cells (Fig. 6) was approximately 5-fold lower than that previously reported for recombinant or tissue-purified protein (15Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5232-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). An explanation for this difference may be that the preparation of GAP proteins in our previous studies included a denaturation-renaturation step that was unnecessary in the purification of GAP proteins through their epitope tags from mammalian cells. As another possibility, the reduced in vivo activity of GAP1–257 could be due to GAP activity in vivo requiring self-oligomerization, which, in turn, requires the carboxyl-terminal domain. Oligomerization of GAP was suggested by our previous observation that GAP from rat liver migrates in a gel filtration column in a position corresponding to a molecular size that is four times that of the monomeric protein (15Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5232-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To investigate the oligomerization state of overexpressed GAP, we generated proteins bearing epitope tags. The addition of the tag increased the size of the protein such that it could be readily resolved from nontagged protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This difference in size allowed us to determine whether the two forms are associated by an immunoprecipitation approach. Cells co-overexpressing nontagged and epitope-tagged proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies against the epitope tag, and the immunoprecipitate was subjected to Western blot analysis by using polyclonal anti-GAP antibodies. The results (Fig. 7) showed that in each case only the larger, epitope-tagged form of either wild-type or truncated GAP (GAP1–257) was present in the precipitate. There was also no coimmunoprecipitation of GAP1–257 with epitope-tagged wild-type GAP. Similar results were obtained when the wild-type GAP used in the different immunoprecipitation experiments was tagged at the amino rather than that carboxyl terminus, arguing against the possibility that the addition of the tag prevented oligomerization (data not shown). These findings indicated that neither wild-type nor truncated overexpressed GAPs self-oligomerize, thus ruling out oligomerization as a reason for the difference between the in vivo activity of the two proteins. An explanation for why GAP behaved in gel filtration as a protein larger than its actual size (15Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5232-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) might be that this behavior reflected aggregation of the protein under the conditions employed or a contribution of bound detergent to the apparent size of the protein. In this study we analyzed two sets of mutations in ARF GAP for their effect on the ability of the protein to deactivate ARF1 in vivo. The first set of mutations affected the amino-terminal part of the GAP. This part of the protein constitutes the GAP catalytic domain that includes an essential Cys4-type zinc finger structure (16Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). As expected, a truncated protein that lacked the first 63 amino acids including the zinc finger domain, as well as a protein with a C22A mutation that prevents the formation of the finger structure, were both ineffective in causing the phenotype of ARF1 deactivation (Figs. 1 and 2). These findings lend further support to our suggestion that the phenotype of ARF1 deactivation upon overexpression of GAP is a result of increased GAP catalytic activity that prevents the generation of active, GTP-bound ARF1 (17Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A second set of mutations resulted in proteins that were progressively truncated at the carboxyl-terminal end. These mutants, which contained intact GAP domains, were expected to possess full catalytic GAP activity (15Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5232-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, whereas a protein with a relatively small truncation (possessing the first 359 of 415 residues) was nearly as effective as wild-type protein in causing the phenotype of ARF1 deactivation, mutants that had further truncations and possessed 335 amino acids or less were rather ineffective (Figs. 3 and 4). These findings were first revealed morphologically by the ability of various GAP mutants to disassemble the Golgi complex. Subsequently the results were substantiated by a biochemical assay that measures specifically Golgi redistribution to the ER (17Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas both wild-type GAP and GAP1–359 induced Golgi-specific glycosylation of the ER glycoprotein Tac-E19, the shorter mutants (GAP1–257, GAP1–277, and GAP1–335) all had a similar and significantly reduced effect (see Fig. 4). This set of studies suggested that GAP activity in vivo requires not only the catalytic domain but also a second functional domain that extends toward the carboxyl-terminal part. In further support for this interpretation, we ruled out two alternate possibilities that might account for the difference in activityin vivo between full-length and truncated GAPs. First, previous findings that bacterially expressed GAP1–257 is as active as tissue-purified protein (15Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5232-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) were confirmed in this study with full-length and truncated proteins expressed and purified from COS cells. Thus, differences in catalytic activity cannot account for the differential in vivo activity of GAP1–257 and wild-type GAP. Additionally, we found that neither wild-type GAP nor GAP1–257 self-oligomerizes when overexpressed, ruling out differences in oligomerization as a reason for the differential in vivo effects of wild-type and truncated GAP. Thus, what could be the basis for the inactivity of GAP1–257 in vivo? One clue is that GAP dynamically distributes between cytosol and the Golgi membrane (16Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Our previous studies with artificial phospholipid micelles have suggested that the productive interaction between ARF and GAP requires that both proteins are bound to a micelle (25Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus the activity of GAP requires its recruitment to a membrane site where it can encounter its membrane-bound substrate, GTP-bound ARF1. Since efficient binding to lipid micelles was observed with GAP1–257 (25Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that the carboxyl-terminal part is involved in binding to lipids. Rather, this noncatalytic domain could be involved in targeting of GAP to a specific membrane compartment by mediating the interaction of GAP with a membrane “receptor” protein. The findings that GAP359 is highly active, whereas GAP335 is rather inactive, suggest that the putative targeting domain terminates before amino acid 359, although it is not known at present how far this domain extends toward the amino-terminal part of the protein. In support of a role of the noncatalytic domain in targeting, a catalytically inactive, full-length GAP mutant (C22A) showed a Golgi-like localization similar to endogenous GAP, whereas the shorter carboxyl-terminally truncated proteins (GAP257 and GAP277) appear to have lost this capacity. Based on the results of this and previous studies, we propose that GAP function in vivo requires a bimodal interaction with membranes mediated by direct binding to lipids through the amino-terminal part as well as interaction of a noncatalytic part with a membrane protein. Such a mechanism can explain the partial activity observed in mutants that lack the noncatalytic domain, as the mass-action effect of overexpression could result in sufficient binding of such mutants to the Golgi complex through the lipid binding domain. Interestingly, ARF GAP belongs to an extensive family of zinc finger proteins that possess a domain with high similarity to GAP catalytic domain, whereas other parts of these proteins do not show significant similarity to GAP (26Hammonds-Odie L.P. Jackson T.R. Profit A.A. Blader I.J. Turck C.W. Prestwich G.D. Theibert A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18859-18868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). An active ARF GAP, previously referred to as GAP2 (27Randazzo P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was recently identified as a member of this zinc finger family. 2M. T. Brown, J. Andrade, H. Radhakrishna, J. G. Donaldson, J. A. Cooper, and P. A. Randazzo, submitted for publication. Perhaps the distinct noncatalytic domains of these two GAPs bear information for targeting to different membrane compartments. In this context, we have shown previously that the transmembrane KDEL receptor acts to recruit ARF GAP to membranes (17Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 28Aoe T. Lee A.J. van Donselaar E. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, in studies to be published elsewhere, 3T. Aoe, I. Huber, C. Vasudevan, G. Romero, D. Cassel, and V. W. Hsu, submitted for publication. a good correlation was observed between the in vivo activity of carboxyl-terminal truncated mutants and their ability to interact with the KDEL receptor. These findings suggest that the KDEL receptor interacts with a noncatalytic part of GAP (either directly or through additional mediator proteins) and that this interaction plays an important role in the targeting of GAP. Future studies of the interaction between GAP and membrane receptors will likely reveal important mechanisms that regulate the GTPase cycle of ARF1. We thank Dr. H. P. Hauri for providing us with antibodies against giantin and Sagie Zuck for help with editing the manuscript."

Backbone NMR chemical shifts were found to be affected by IGFBP-1 binding in the following residues: Pro2, Glu3, Cys6, Gly7, Gly19, Pro28–Gly30, Gly32, Arg36, Arg37, Gln40–Gly42, Pro63, Lys65, Pro66, and Lys68–Ala70. Three IGF-I arginine side chains were identified by NMR to participate in IGFBP-1 binding. All IGF-I arginine residues were replaced by alanines, using site-directed mutagenesis, in four single substituted variants, IGF-I(R21A), IGF-I(R50A), IGF-I(R55A), and IGF-I(R56A), and one double replacement mutant, IGF-I(R36A/R37A). Biosensor interaction analysis binding studies demonstrate the involvement of Arg36-Arg37 and Arg50 in IGFBP-1 binding, while experiments with the IGF-I receptor implicate Arg21, Arg36-Arg37, and Arg56 as part of the receptor binding epitope. These overlapping binding surfaces explain why IGF-I receptor and IGFBP-1 binding to IGF-I is competitive. The C terminus of free, but not IGFBP-1-bound, IGF-I is found to exist in two distinct, NMR-detectable conformations at 30 °C. One possible explanation for this structural heterogeneity could be cis-trans isomerization of the Cys6–Cys48 disulfide bond.

The insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I1 and IGF-II) bind with nanomolar affinities to specific binding proteins present in extracellular fluids (1Bach L.A. Hsieh S. Sakano K. Fujiwara H. Perdue J.F. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9246-9254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) prolong the half-life of the IGFs, are believed to participate in the in vivo folding of IGFs (2Hober S. Hansson A. Uhlén M. Nilsson B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6758-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and inhibit IGF binding to the insulin receptor. The IGFBPs have also been shown to either inhibit or stimulate the growth-promoting effects the IGFs have on cell cultures, most likely by altering the interaction of IGFs with their cell surface receptors (3Mohan S.

There are at least six different IGFBPs that have homologous amino acid sequences. Human IGFBP-1, -2, -3, and -5 each contain 18 cysteine residues in conserved positions; IGFBP-4 contains two additional cysteines; and IGFBP-6 has only 16. The characteristic N-terminal cysteine pattern of the IGFBPs, GC(G/S)CCXXCAXXXXXXC, can also be founde.g. in the human proteins MAC25 (4Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Tsuchiya K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Several mutagenesis studies have addressed the localization of IGFBP binding determinants on the IGFs. A naturally occurring N-terminally truncated form of IGF-I, des(1–3), has been found to be 5–10-fold more potent in stimulating protein synthesis in rat myoblasts (14Ballard F.J. Francis G.L. Ross M. Bagley C.J. May B. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), explained by a 60-fold lower affinity for IGFBPs present in these cells (15Bagley C.J. May B.L. Szabo L. McNamara P.J. Ross M. Francis G.L. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Clemmons et al. (16Clemmons D.R. Dehoff M.L. Busby W.H. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 890-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have found that mutation of the IGF-I residues 3 and 4 as well as 49–51 leads to reduced affinity for IGFBP-1. A more detailed understanding of the nature of the interactions between the insulin-like growth factors and their moderating binding proteins may be used to aid design of more potent IGF-derived pharmaceutical agents. In this article, we present a heteronuclear NMR study of15N- and 13C-labeled IGF-I. By a comparison of the IGF-I chemical shifts in the presence and absence of IGFBP-1, a structural binding epitope could be defined. The NMR analysis indicates that three arginine side chains in IGF-I are affected by complex formation with IGFBP-1. To further confirm the identity and the importance of these interactions and to probe possible differences between the structural and functional binding epitope (17Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar), site-directed mutagenesis was utilized. Every IGF-I arginine was replaced by alanine through the construction of four single substituted variants, R21A, R50A, R55A, and R56A, and one double replacement mutant, R36A/R37A. The effect on binding was evaluated using Biosensor kinetic interaction analysis, and as a comparison, the binding of IGF-I to immobilized IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) in the presence of IGFBP-1 was evaluated to test for the presence of overlapping residues involved in both IGFBP-1 and IGF-IR binding. The IGF-I variants were produced intracellularly in Escherichia coli as fusions to the IgG binding domain Z derived from the B domain of staphylococcal protein A (18Nilsson B. Moks T. Jansson B. Abrahmsén L. Elmblad A. Holmgren E. Henrichson C. Jones T.A. Uhlén M. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The production of labeled IGF-I followed closely the previously published procedures for IGF-II labeling and IGF-I variant production (19Jansson M. Li Y.C. Jendeberg L. Anderson S. Montelione G.T. Nilsson B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 20Jansson M. Uhlén M. Nilsson B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). E. coli RV308 ompT containing the plasmid pKP522, was grown in defined minimal medium with (15NH4)2SO4 as the sole source of nitrogen and, in the case of double labeling, (15N and 13C) with 13C-glucose as the sole carbon source. Protein was recovered from inclusion bodies by resuspension in 6 m guanidine HCl followed by IgG affinity chromatography as described by Jansson et al. (20Jansson M. Uhlén M. Nilsson B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The IGF-I moiety was released from the Z fusion partner by hydroxylamine-mediated cleavage (20Jansson M. Uhlén M. Nilsson B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Nilsson B. Forsberg G. Hartmanis M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Separation of the IGF-I products after cleavage was performed by cation exchange chromatography using a Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The elution gradient was from 10 to 52% B in 20 min. Buffer A contained 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.4, 10% ethanol; buffer B contained 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.4, 10% ethanol. The final purification, separating native and mismatched IGF-I forms (22Forsberg G. Palm G. Ekebacke A. Josephson S. Hartmanis M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was performed using a C8 reverse-phase HPLC column. IGFBP-1 and IGF-IR were produced in mammalian expression systems and purified as described (23Jansson M. Hallen D. Koho H. Andersson G. Berghard L. Heidrich J. Nyberg E. Uhlén M. Kördel J. Nilsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8189-8197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). IGF-I labeled with 13C and15N was studied by NMR either alone or in complex with IGFBP-1 at 600 μm and pH 3.4. Between this pH and its pI value (4.8; determined by isoelectric focusing), IGFBP-1 precipitates. Previous observation of the aggregation tendencies of IGF-I, as well as IGFBP-1, when free in solution, dictated that the complex was formed at dilute concentrations with an excess of IGFBP-1, in 7 ml of 1 mm sodium citrate buffer and then subsequently concentrated by reduction of the sample volume to 200 μl using a vacuum rotation concentrator. Introduction of point mutations in IGF-I was performed in a two-step sequential PCR reaction using two general IGF-I primers in combination with two specific primers for each mutation. The general primers were designed for the expression vector pKP522, containing a synthetic IGF-I gene (19Jansson M. Li Y.C. Jendeberg L. Anderson S. Montelione G.T. Nilsson B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The general 5′ primer 5′-AGT AGA CGC GAA TTC TAA CGG -3′ covered the EcoRI cloning site and the general 3′ primer 5′-AAT CAG CAA GCT TCT AAG CAG ATT-3′ covered the HindIII site. Mutations were introduced by first producing two separate PCR fragments from each general primer to a specific primer at the point of mutation. This results in two overlapping fragments, one from the 5′-end to the mutagenesis site and one from the mutagenesis site to the 3′-end. The obtained PCR fragments were mixed, and a second round of PCR using the general primers was performed. The mutation primers used for each variant were as follows: R21A:1, 5′-TTG TTT GCG GTG ACG CTG GTT T-3′; R21A:2, 5′-GTT AAA ATA AAA ACC AGC GTC A-3′; R3637A:1, 5′-GGT TCT TCT TCT GCT GCT GCT CC-3′ R3637A:2, 5′-CCA GTC TGG GGA GCA GCA GCA G-3′; R50A:1, 5′-ATG CTG CTT TGC TTC ATG CG-3′; R50A:2, 5′-CGC AGG TCG CAT GAA GCA AAG-3′; R55A:1, 5′-TTC TTG CGA CCT GGC TCG TCT G-3′; R55A:2, 5′-ATA CAT TTC CAG ACG AGC CAG G-3′; R56A:1, 5′-CTT GCG ACC TGC GTG CTC TGA A-3′; R56A:2, 5′-CAA TAC ATT TCC AGA GCA CGC A-3′. The PCR reactions were performed according to Ref. 24Ausubel, F. M. (1995) Current Protocols In Molecular Biology, Chapter 8.5, Wiley Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar. PCR primers were synthesized by Cybergene AB (Huddinge, Sweden). PCR deoxynucleotides were obtained as a premixed 10 mm solution (Boehringer Mannheim) while the Taqpolymerase was from Perkin-Elmer. All the mutations were verified using automated dideoxy sequencing on an ABI 373 (Applied Biosystems). The IGF-I variant proteins were produced as described for labeled protein except for the use of Terrific Broth/Glycerol medium (Sigma). All purified proteins were verified by quantitative amino acid analysis, laser desorption mass spectrometry, and analytical reverse-phase HPLC. CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco J 720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Japan). Protein samples were dissolved in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Spectra were recorded from 250 to 184 nm at a step resolution of 0.1 nm and a scanning speed of 5 nm/min. Each spectrum is the average of five accumulated scans. Subsequently, actual concentration of each protein sample was determined by quantitative amino acid composition analysis. All NMR experiments were performed on Varian Unity and Unity+ 500- and 600-MHz spectrometers. The following spectra were recorded: 1H-15N HSQC (25Muhandiram D.R. Farrow N.A. Xu G.Y. Smallcombe S.H.

Yamazaki T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 103: 197-201Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The spectra were processed with the NMR-Pipe program (34Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.M. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11563) Google Scholar) using linear prediction in the 15N and/or 13C dimensions of the three-dimensional spectra. The spectra were assigned with the interactive graphics program ANSIG (35Kraulis P.J. J. Magn.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3515-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The binding affinities of the IGF-I variants were measured using BIAcore real time kinetic interaction analysis (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The measurements were performed as previously published (23Jansson M. Hallen D. Koho H. Andersson G. Berghard L. Heidrich J. Nyberg E. Uhlén M. Kördel J. Nilsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8189-8197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), with IGFBP-1 or IGF-IR as the immobilized part of the complex. The acceptor protein was immobilized via primary amine groups utilizingN′-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide coupling reagents (37Löfå S. Johnsson B. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1990; 21: 1526-1528Crossref Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Protein absorption and coupling were performed at pH 4. Immobilization was performed at 5 μl/min using 1× HBS (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.05% P20). All kinetic experiments were performed using 1× HBS as the driving buffer at a flow rate of 8 μl/min. The injection of analyte was controlled using the Kinject command in the BIAlogue™ control software. All of the variants were injected in concentrations of 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, and 640 nm for both the IGFBP-1 and IGF-IR experiments. Kinetic measurements were performed by injection of each analyte for 300 s followed by disassociation in buffer flow for 400 s. The temperature in all kinetic experiments was 25 °C. Binding of IGF-I to IGF-IR in the presence of IGFBP-1 was tested using immobilized IGF-IR and free IGF-I in concentrations of 8, 16, 33, 66, and 131 nm and complexed to IGFBP in IGF-I/IGFBP-1 proportions of 2:1 and 1:5. Kinetic parameters were calculated using the kinetics evaluation software package BIAevaluation 2 (Biacore AB). Protein concentration was determined using quantitative amino acid analysis. Earlier NMR studies of unlabeled IGF-I showed very poor spectral quality at pH values above 3.0 and in a concentration range of 3–7 mm due to dimerization (5Cooke R.M. Harvey T.S. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Others have reduced the IGF-I self-association at 2–10 mm protein concentration, and thereby improved the spectral quality, by the addition of 10% (8Sato A. Nishimura S. Ohkubo T. Kyogoku Y. Koyama S. Kobayashi M. Yasuda T. Kobayashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or 20% (9Sato A. Nishimura S. Ohkubo T. Kyogoku Y. Koyama S. Kobayashi M. Yasuda T. Kobayashi Y. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993; 41: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) acetic acid. In this study, we have not used acetic acid, since it influences the IGF-I/IGFBP-1 binding affinity. We found that spectral quality for IGF-I is marginally improved by dilution to submillimolar concentrations and confirm that, as pointed out by Cookeet al. (5Cooke R.M. Harvey T.S. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), elevated temperatures improve the spectral quality significantly. We made use of IGF-I labeled with 15N as well as13C and 15N to aid these NMR studies. The molecular masses of the labeled IGF-I material were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry to determine the isotope incorporation levels. The mass of the 15N-labeled IGF-I was found to be 7740, which corresponds to an 15N incorporation level of 99.98%. The 13C,15N-labeled IGF-I mass of 8063.5 corresponds to a 99.97% degree of isotope labeling. The NMR signals from the backbone of13C,15N-IGF-I were initially assigned at 50 °C and pH 3.4 for compatibility with previously published1H assignments (5Cooke R.M. Harvey T.S. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and optimization of the spectral quality. The NMR methodology used was to perform sequential walks in either HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH spectra or HNCO and CBCACOHA spectra. A total of 84% of the 1HN, 15N,13Cα, and 13Cβchemical shifts and 71% of the 13C′ chemical shifts could be assigned. The residues that remained elusive and for which no assignments could be made at 50 °C are the N-terminal residue Gly1, Cys6, and the polypeptide segment Asp45–Phe49. Cooke et al. (5Cooke R.M. Harvey T.S. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) could assign 87% of the backbone and 72% out of the total number of protons. No assignments whatsoever could be made for residues 18, 34–37, 50, 63, 68, and 69 in that study. For the studies performed with acetic acid present (6Hua Q.X. Narhi L. Jia W.H. Arakawa T.

Kobayashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), virtually complete assignments were accomplished. Once our attempts were started to form complexes between IGF-I and IGFBP-1, it became clear that spectral quality for the complex was improved by lowering the temperature to 30 °C. For internal consistency, the backbone assignment procedure was repeated on a fresh sample of 13C,15N-IGF-I, but now at 30 °C and pH 3.4. The spectral quality of IGF-I alone at this temperature, however, only allows partial assignments. The IGF-I residues for which any assignments can be made unambiguously at 30 °C are Pro2-Glu3, Gly7, Gly19, Pro28–Thr41, Ser51, Met59, and Pro63–Ala70. When comparing the IGF-I chemical shifts at 30 and 50 °C, only a few residues exhibit differences deviating from the expected temperature dependence. The 15N chemical shift of Ala70changes almost 1 ppm more than warranted by the temperature change, while the 13Cα and13Cβ differences for Ala70 are not only half a ppm larger than expected but in the opposite direction. IGF-I labeled with 13C and 15N was studied in complex with IGFBP-1 at 600 μm, 30 °C, and pH 3.4. A few more, but far from all, IGF-I resonances can be assigned unambiguously in the complex than in the free state despite the monomer molecular mass increase from 7 to 30 kDa. The residues for which any unambiguous resonance assignments can be made in the complex at 30 °C are Pro2, Glu3, Cys6, Gly7, Pro28–Gly42, Ser51, Leu54, Arg55, Glu58, Met59, Pro63–Ala70. Fig. 2 shows 15N HSQC spectra of IGF-I with and without IGFBP-1 present and highlights the larger15N/1HN chemical shift differences. Significant chemical shift differences, defined as greater than 0.15 ppm for 15N or greater than 0.3 ppm for either of the13Cα or 13Cβresonances, are observed for residues Pro2, Glu3, Gly7, Gly19, Pro28–Gly30, Gly32, Arg36, Arg37, Gln40-Thr41, Pro63, Lys65, Pro66, and Lys68–Ala70 (Table I). For one additional residue, Gly42, chemical shift differences can be inferred indirectly by comparing expected 30 °C chemical shifts in the free state, based on chemical shifts observed at 50 °C for this state, with measured chemical shifts at 30 °C for the complexed state.Table ISignificant chemical shift changes identified in IGF-I when IGFBP-1 is addedResidueΔ 1HNΔ 15NΔ13CαΔ 13CβPro2−0.15−0.38Glu30.10−0.18NDNDGly7−0.23−1.57−0.72Gly190.02−0.26NDPro28−0.16−0.40Thr29−0.01−0.210.10−0.05Gly300.02−0.11−0.31Gly320.02−0.09−0.31Arg360.040.24−0.01−0.30Arg370.010.02−0.26−0.46Gln400.030.070.06−0.71Thr410.06−0.19−0.33−0.20Pro630.18−0.49Lys65−0.02−0.09−0.11−0.34Pro66−0.21−0.38Lys680.030.12−0.13−0.45Ser69−0.02−0.67−0.27−0.32Ala70−0.33−3.69−2.11−0.63Residues for which the 15N chemical shift changes by more than 0.15 or either 13C chemical shift changes by more than 0.3 ppm have been included.ND, not detected in both forms.

ND, not detected in both forms. In addition, from Fig. 2 it is apparent that at least three of the arginine Nε/Hε chemical shifts are affected, implying that arginine side chains are involved in the IGF-I/IGFBP-1 interaction. Based on the identified backbone chemical shift perturbation upon complexation, it is plausible that Arg36 and Arg37 participate in the binding epitope. Novel triple resonance NMR experiments by Yamazaki et al.(38Yamazaki T. Pascal S.M. Singer A.U. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3556-3564Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) allow the assignment of arginine guanidino 15N and1H chemical shifts in a conformationally independent manner. To accomplish this, it is, however, necessary to have the13Cδ and Hδ chemical shifts of the arginine side chains assigned. It is also possible to observe cross-peaks for the 15Nε,1Hε, 13Cδ, and13Cγ nuclei of the arginine side chain in the HNCACB experiment. For IGF-I in complex with IGFBP-1 and alone at 30 °C, cross-peaks can be found for all six arginine side chains, while only one arginine side chain group is detectable in free IGF-I at 50 °C. The 13Cδ and13Cγ chemical shifts are very similar and only vary by a few tenths of a ppm, respectively. To match these with the correct residue, it is necessary to assign the13Cδ and 13Cγchemical shifts, for instance, in a CC(CO)NH-total correlation spectroscopy experiment. The spectral quality of this experiment is too poor (particularly for free IGF-I at 30 °C) to unambiguously assign the IGF-I arginine 13Cδ and13Cγ nuclei. Consequently, it has not been possible, in our hands, to uniquely assign the arginine guanidino groups of IGF-I, and subsequently deconvolute the arginine participation in the IGFBP-1 binding epitope, using current NMR techniques alone. Instead, arginine to alanine substituted IGF-I variants R21A, R36A/R37A, R50A, R55A, and R56A were constructed by site-specificin vitro mutagenesis. Clones were DNA-sequenced and found to correspond to the anticipated sequences. The IGF-I and IGF-I variants were produced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity, essentially as described previously for other IGF-I variants (20Jansson M. Uhlén M. Nilsson B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of amino acid composition and determined molecular masses correspond to the theoretically expected values for all variants (data not shown). The far-UV CD spectra of IGF-I and the IGF-I variants were determined (Fig. 3). The spectra are almost completely coinciding over the entire wavelength range, indicative of a highly similar overall secondary structure content. Because of this lack of structural changes, all variations in binding affinities between IGF-I and its variants are expected to be caused by differences in side chain properties. The kinetic measurements of IGF-Is binding to IGFBP-1 and IGF-IR (Fig. 4) were performed at a number of different concentrations for each ligand. The total estimated error from concentration determination, pipetting, and data fitting was less than 10%, corresponding to a calculated error of less than 10% in the measured rates and less than 22% in the calculated K a values. The results from the biosensor measurements of IGF-I arginine-substituted variants are summarized in Table II. In the binding of IGF-I variants to IGFBP-1, R36A/R37A, R50A, and R55A display significantly altered association rates (k a), whereas only R36A/R37A and R50A have significantly changed dissociation rates (k d). The binding kinetics of arginine-substituted variants to IGF-IR display alterations in both association and dissociation. The R21A, R36A/R37A, and R50A have decreased association rates. Dissociation is significantly increased for the R21A, R36A/R37A, and R56A variants.Table IIBIAcore kinetics for IGF-I variants binding to IGFBP-1 and IGF-I.Binding to IGFBP-1k ak dK AK A (percentage of WT)×10ms×10 s×10m%IGF-I (WT)6.71 ± 0.672.78 ± 0.282.41 ± 0.53100R21A6.75 ± 0.683.10 ± 0.312.18 ± 0.4890R36A/R37A5.07 ± 0.513.47 ± 0.351.46 ± 0.3261R50A3.12 ± 0.313.61 ± 0.360.86 ± 0.1936R55A8.34 ± 0.832.98 ± 0.302.80 ± 0.62116R56A6.84 ± 0.683.29 ± 0.332.08 ± 0.4686Binding to IGF-IRk ak dK AK A (percentage of WT)×10ms×10 s×10 m%IGF-I (WT)4.83 ± 0.482.79 ± 0.281.73 ± 0.38100R21A3.35 ± 0.346.10 ± 0.610.55 ± 0.1232R36A/R37A1.64 ± 0.165.38 ± 0.400.34 ± 0.0718R50A3.42 ± 0.343.11 ± 0.311.10 ± 0.2464R55A4.15 ± 0.422.65 ± 0.271.57 ± 0.3591R56A4.16 ± 0.424.73 ± 0.470.88 ± 0.1951The calculated total error of 10% in rate determinations, corresponding to a total of 22% error in calculated affinity is indicated in the table.WT, wild type.

The binding of IGF-I to immobilized IGF-IR was studied in the presence of different ratios of IGFBP-1, to test for the presence of overlapping IGFBP-1 and IGF-IR binding epitopes. The IGF-I·IGFBP-1 complex does not bind to the receptor when the IGFBP-1 excess is 5-fold as shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore, a 50% association rate decrease, compared with unassociated IGF-I, can be observed for IGF-IR binding of an IGF-I/IGFBP-1 mixture in a 2:1 ratio. This is consistent with only free IGF-I binding to the receptor and indicative of overlapping binding sites for the receptor and IGFBP-1 on IGF-I, resulting in mutual exclusion of binding. The NMR chemical shift of a given nuclei depends on its electronic environment. If this environment changes, then so will the chemical shift. Perturbations of chemical shifts upon the addition of a ligand are a reliable indication of intermolecular interaction (39Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G."
https://openalex.org/W2045364146,"Receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (FcγR) initiate phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles by a process involving the assembly of a multi-molecular signaling complex. Several members of this complex have been identified, including Src family kinases, Syk/ZAP 70 family kinases, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K). To test directly the role of PI3-K in mediating phagocytosis, we assessed the phagocytic ability of chimeric receptors composed of FcγR extracellular and transmembrane domains fused to regions of the p85 subunit of PI3-K. We found that chimeric receptors with cytoplasmic tails composed of the entire p85 subunit of PI3-K or the inter-Src homology 2 portion of p85 triggered phagocytosis in transfected COS fibroblasts. These two chimeras also showed phosphoinositide kinase activity in vitro when immunoadsorbed. In contrast, a chimera containing only the carboxyl-terminal Src homology 2 domain of p85 that does not interact with the catalytic p110 subunit of PI3-K did not trigger phagocytosis, nor did it show kinase activity in vitro. These data suggest that localization and direct activation of PI3-K at the site of particle attachment is sufficient to trigger the process of phagocytosis.

Fc receptors for IgG (FcγR)1 trigger cellular processes that mediate the crucial protective functions of antibodies. Our understanding of one such cellular process, namely phagocytosis, by which IgG-coated pathogens are engulfed and degraded, is beginning to yield to intense molecular dissection. This process is initiated by ligation of FcγR with IgG-coated particles and proceeds by the spreading of pseudopods around the particle, with receptors binding ligands in a zipper-like fashion (1Griffin Jr., F.M. Griffin J.A. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 788-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A multi-molecular signaling complex assembles beneath the membrane at the site of particle attachment that induces remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton required to complete the internalization process (1Griffin Jr., F.M. Griffin J.A. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 788-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 2Zigmond S.H. Hirsch J.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1972; 73: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).The earliest identifiable signal associated with receptor clustering is tyrosine kinase activity, which is necessary for phagocytosis to proceed (3Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 4Hutchinson M.J. Harrison P.T. Floto R.A. Allen J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic portions of FcγR do not contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Instead these receptors either contain (FcγRIIa) or associate with an auxiliary molecule that contains (FcR γ-chain) a conserved amino acid motif that upon phosphorylation of critical tyrosine residues serves as a docking site for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins (5Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). This docking site is designated immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM).Our major working hypothesis explaining signal transduction leading to phagocytosis states that, immediately after receptor clustering, the ITAM is phosphorylated by one or another member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Src kinases have been co-isolated with FcγR in the resting state (6Duchemin A.-M. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 865-871PubMed Google Scholar), and their activities appear to increase following receptor clustering (7Salcedo T.W. Kurosaki T. Kanakaraj P. Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp.

The phosphorylated ITAM then recruits other SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules including the tyrosine kinase Syk (9Chacko G.W. Duchemin A.-M. Coggeshall K.M. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T.

Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar).A variety of observations confirm the requirement of Syk kinase in the signal pathway leading to phagocytosis. First, Syk-deficient lymphocytes failed to trigger significant F-actin assembly after clustering of ITAM-containing receptors (14Cox D. Chang P. Kurosaki T. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16597-16602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Second, chimeric receptors composed of FcγR extracellular domains fused to Syk kinase cytoplasmic tails triggered phagocytosis quite successfully in COS fibroblasts (15Greenberg S. Chang P. Wang D. Xavier R. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Recently, macrophages derived from Syk-deficient mice were found to be incapable of completing phagocytosis, manifesting only partial pseudopods that contained F-actin beneath the attached particles but failed to mature into enveloping pseudopods and internalized phagosomes (16Crowley M.T. Costello P.S. Fitzer-Attas C.J. Turner M. Meng F.Y. Lowell C. Tybulewicz V.L. DeFranco A.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Of special interest to our study, these Syk-deficient cells showed no association of the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, indicating that recruitment of PI3-K to receptor complexes did not occur. Furthermore, the block in phagocytosis exhibited by these Syk-deficient macrophages morphologically resembled the effect of the PI3-K enzyme inhibitor wortmannin on normal macrophages (16Crowley M.T. Costello P.S. Fitzer-Attas C.J. Turner M. Meng F.Y. Lowell C. Tybulewicz V.L. DeFranco A.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). These data place Syk kinase upstream of PI3-K in the signaling pathway and would suggest that the role of Syk kinase in phagocytosis is to allow the recruitment and activation of PI3-K.FcγR clustering leads to the association of PI3-K with receptor complexes and to an increase in PI3-K activity in various cell types (11Chacko G.W.

PI3-K has been implicated in the process of FcγR-mediated phagocytosis in neutrophils (17Ninomiya N. Hazeki K. Fukui Y. Seya T. Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) through the use of inhibitors of PI3-K catalysis such as wortmannin. Wortmannin not only blocks phagocytosis in these cells, it also blocks granule exocytosis and cell killing directed through FcγR in NK cells (19Bonnema J.D. Karnitz L.M. Schoon R.A. Abraham R.T. Leibson P.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), indicating a conserved role for PI3-K in FcγR signaling. The enzyme phosphorylates phosphoinositides at the D-3 position of the inositol ring, producing phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate that act as second messengers (20Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 21Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The particular isoform of PI3-K associated with FcγR is a heterodimer composed of a regulatory subunit designated p85 and a catalytic subunit designated p110. The several functional domains of the p85 subunit include a Src homology 3 domain, a breakpoint cluster region, two SH2 domains, and an inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain (Fig. 1). The two SH2 domains direct the interaction of PI3-K with activated receptors (22Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 23Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), whereas the breakpoint cluster region domain may bind small G-proteins such as Rac (24Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The iSH2 domain, required for the enzymatic activity of PI3-K, binds to the p110 subunit to form a constitutively active enzyme (25Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).To test directly the role of PI3-K in mediating phagocytosis, we assessed the phagocytic capacity of three chimeric receptors composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of FcγRIa fused to regions of the p85 subunit of PI3-K. The chimeras were designed to mimic the recruitment of PI3-K to immune complex-induced FcγR clusters without the need for additional proteins of the proximal signal cascade, specifically, FcR γ-chain and its ITAM, members of the Src family that phosphorylate FcR γ-chain, and Syk. The three chimeras are depicted in Fig. 1. The cytoplasmic portion of the first chimera is composed of the wild type p85, which contains several known functional domains of PI3-K. The tail of the second contains only the iSH2 region, which is responsible for binding the catalytic p110 subunit of PI3-K causing constitutive kinase activity (26Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The third chimera includes only the carboxyl-terminal SH2 region (SH2-C) of p85, which is not capable of binding the p110 subunit. These chimeras allow us to separate the contributions of p85 adaptor functions from enzymatic induced functions of PI3-K. Using a model system that we have characterized extensively (27Lowry M.B. Duchemin A.-M. Robinson J.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we transiently transfected these chimeric receptors into COS cells to examine their capacity to mediate phagocytosis. We herein show that chimeric receptors that localize PI3-K enzymatic activity to the site of particle attachment mediate phagocytosis in COS fibroblasts and circumvent the need for ITAMs and associated Src and Syk kinases acting upstream.RESULTSThe three chimeras depicted in Fig. 1 were transiently transfected into COS cells to examine phagocytosis in this model system. First, we tested the functional ability of the expressed chimeras to bind IgG-coated particles in a rosette assay. Cells expressing all three types of chimeras were capable of binding FITC-labeled IgG-coated RBC to form robust and stable rosettes that were morphologically indistinguishable from rosettes seen with COS cells expressing wild type FcγRIa. Thus, the chimeras were functional by the criterion of ligand binding.Because linking the p85 subunit to a receptor at the membrane introduces a new physical constraint on the p85 subunit that could affect the assembly with the catalytic p110 subunit of PI3-K, we assayed whether the chimeric receptors were still capable of forming a functionally active inositol kinase. COS cells cotransfected with the chimeras and the p110 subunit were incubated with anti-FcγRI antibody, the receptors were clustered with a secondary antibody, and the cells were then lysed. The chimeric receptors were immunoadsorbed with an anti-HA epitope antibody recognizing the HA tag present at the carboxyl terminus of each chimera, and the adsorbates were subjected to a PI3-K assay using phosphatidylinositol lipid micelles and32P-labeled ATP. We found that both the Ia-p85 and the Ia-iSH2 chimeras reconstituted enzymatic activity (Fig. 2), as predicted by their described ability to bind the p110 subunit (29Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hu Q. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5560-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Ia-SH2-C chimera, which cannot bind the p110 subunit (29Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hu Q. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5560-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), did not show PI3-K activity. Wild type FcγRIa also did not show PI3-K activity (data not shown), as expected because FcγRIa in the absence of γ-chain does not mediate phagocytosis.Figure 2PI3-K assay of chimeric receptors expressed in COS cells. Transfected COS cells were activated by clustering the chimeric receptors with an anti-FcγRI antibody and a cross-linking secondary antibody and were then lysed. The chimeras were immunoadsorbed with the antibody indicated beneath the lanes and the adsorbates were then subjected to a PI3-K assay. The adsorbates were incubated with phosphatidylinositol micelles in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and the lipid products were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography. The resulting autoradiograph is shown, with O indicating the origin and Pindicating the PI3P product. In lane 1, mock-transfected COS cells were adsorbed as a control for specificity. In lane 2, wild type p85 was immunoadsorbed from mock-transfected COS as a positive control for PI3-K activity. In lane 3, 100 nm wortmannin (W) was added to the adsorbed wild type p85 in vitro to inhibit PI3-K activity and its product (P) as a standard. In lanes 4–6, the chimeras were co-transfected with the p110 subunit and the indicated chimeric receptors were adsorbed with the anti-HA antibody. Only the Ia-iSH2 and the Ia-p85 chimeras show PI3-K activity (lanes 5 and 6). We have not identified the intermediate spots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the phagocytic ability of the chimeras, we quantified by microscopy the capacity of transfected COS cells to phagocytose RBC opsonized with IgG. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with FITC-labeled RBC opsonized with IgG and were then subjected to a brief hypotonic shock to lyse externally bound RBC. The samples were fixed and examined by phase and fluorescence microscopy for internalized RBC. Phagocytosed RBC were readily apparent in cells transfected with the Ia-p85 and Ia-iSH2 chimeras but not in cells expressing the Ia-SH2-C chimera (Fig. 3). Internalized RBC were counted for each transfectant and expressed as a phagocytic index (PI). The data are tabulated in Table I. The chimeras were compared in each experiment to wild type FcγRIa, which shows little or no phagocytosis, and to FcγRIIa, which shows efficient phagocytosis. FcγRIa expressed alone does not contain an ITAM required for phagocytosis and thus serves as a base line, while FcγRIIa contains an ITAM and can recruit Syk kinase family members as well as PI3-K (11Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Comparing the Ia-p85 chimera to FcγRIIa showed that the chimera was capable of mediating phagocytosis at levels similar to FcγRIIa (PI 170 versus 153). Cotransfection of the p110 subunit with the Ia-p85 chimera raised the phagocytic index to levels significantly above that of FcγRIIa (PI 268 versus153), indicating very efficient phagocytosis. The Ia-iSH2 chimera also triggered phagocytosis, although at levels slightly lower than that of FcγRIIa (PI 108 versus 153) or the Ia-p85 chimera. Cotransfection of the p110 subunit with the Ia-iSH2 chimera increased the phagocytic index to levels similar to FcγRIIA (PI 153versus 153). The Ia-SH2-C chimera did not support phagocytosis except at base-line levels, much like FcγRIa alone (PI 16 and 26). Co-transfection of the Ia-SH2-C chimera with p110 only slightly increased the mean phagocytic index (PI 36).Figure 3Phagocytosis of the receptor chimeras.COS cells transfected with the three receptor chimeras were incubated with FITC-labeled RBC opsonized with IgG at 37 °C for 1 h to allow phagocytosis to occur. The cells were then subjected to a brief hypotonic shock to lyse externally bound RBC and were fixed and examined by phase and fluorescence microscopy. Panels A, C, and E are phase contrast micrographs;panels B, D, and F are fluorescence micrographs of the same cells detecting the FITC- labeled RBC targets. In panels A and B, internalized RBC targets can be seen clearly in a COS cell cotransfected with the Ia-p85 chimera and p110 subunit. In panels C and D, internalized RBC are also readily apparent in a cell cotransfected with the Ia-iSH2 chimera and p110 subunit. In contrast, panels E and F show a COS cell transfected with the Ia-SH2-C chimera and p110 subunit that does not show any internalized RBC but shows lysed RBC ghosts bound to the surface visible only by fluorescence microscopy.

The number of RBC internalized by 100 receptor-expressing cells (mean ± S.D.) was expressed as the phagocytic index. *, the phagocytic indices of these receptors are significantly greater than that of FcγRIa (p < 0.01 for all indicated receptors). ‡, the increase in phagocytic index upon co-transfection of the p110 subunit with Ia-p85 is significant (p < 0.001). Open table in a new tab To consider whether receptor densities of the expressed chimeras accounted for their phagocytic capacities, we measured in parallel both receptor expression by flow cytometry and phagocytosis. Surface expression of the chimeras was analyzed using an antibody that recognizes the extracellular region of FcγRIa. The data from two experiments are shown in Table II. We found that wild type FcγRIa, which mediates minimal phagocytosis, is expressed in a higher percentage of cells and at a greater relative density than any of the phagocytic chimeras. The expression of the p110 subunit with the Ia-p85 chimera appears to increase the density of the Ia-p85 chimera, but has no apparent effect on the expression of either the Ia-iSH2 or the Ia-SH2-C chimeras. Parallel phagocytosis experiments show that a high density of receptor does not correlate with phagocytic ability. Specifically, FcγRIa-transfected cells show the lowest phagocytic index despite having the highest relative density of receptor. In contrast, the Ia-iSH2 chimera coexpressed with p110 confers a high phagocytic index while expressing only a very low receptor density. The Ia-SH2-C chimera transfected with or without p110 confers a low phagocytic index similar to FcγRIa while expression is commensurate with the other chimeras. The phagocytic index of 59 for the Ia-SH2-C chimera transfected with p110 noted in experiment 2 was the highest observed value of four experiments, which averaged 36, not significantly different from FcγRIa (Table I). Thus, the differences found in the phagocytic capacity are attributable to the signaling capacity of the receptors and not simply to receptor density. We suggest that receptor density plays a role in influencing the ability of the transfected cells to bind IgG-coated targets. Cells with a density of receptor too low to permit RBC binding are not considered functional in this assay as only cells capable of binding the IgG-coated RBC are examined.To determine whether actin was polymerized during chimera-mediated phagocytosis, we evaluated the effect of cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of F-actin polymerization that blocks phagocytosis in professional phagocytes and in COS cells expressing functional FcγR (32Indik Z. Kelly C. Chien P. Levinson A.I. Schreiber A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1766-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As seen in Table III, part A, cytochalasin D blocked internalization of IgG-coated RBC while leaving unaffected the binding of IgG-coated RBC to the chimera-expressing cells. We also analyzed directly whether actin was polymerized in response to particle binding by staining actin filaments with FITC-phalloidin early in the course of phagocytosis and examining cells by confocal microscopy. Transfected COS cells were incubated with IgG-coated beads for 15 min at 37 °C and were then fixed and stained to detect actin filaments. As illustrated in Fig. 4, COS cells cotransfected with the Ia-p85 chimera and p110 subunit show accumulations of F-actin in cuplike structures beneath bound beads, while wild type FcγRIa alone does not show any F-actin accumulations due to bead binding. Thus, the chimeric receptors, like competent FcγR, activate the actin cytoskeleton during the course of phagocytosis.Table IIICytochalasin D and wortmannin block chimera-mediated phagocytosisA.

Binding of the RBC to the cells was measured by rosetting of the RBC in parallel samples incubated at 4 °C.

Transfected COS cells were incubated with IgG-coated beads for 15 min at 37 °C to allow the initial steps of phagocytosis to proceed.

Panels A and C show the fluorescent actin filament staining of the cells, while panels B and D show companion non-confocal phase contrast images to locate the beads. In panels A and B, a COS cell cotransfected with the Ia-p85 chimera and p110 subunit displays actin filaments accumulating beneath bound beads in cuplike structures (arrows in A, corresponding beads in B), indicating triggered actin polymerization. Inpanels C and D, a COS cell transfected with FcγRIa alone does not show any triggered actin polymerization beneath bound beads, reflecting the inability of the receptor to mediate internalization.

Hazeki K. Fukui Y. Seya T. Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22732-22737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and macrophages (18Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). To examine whether phagocytosis mediated by the chimeric receptors was also sensitive to PI3-K inhibitors, we evaluated the effect of wortmannin. Wortmannin blocked the phagocytic capacity of the chimeric receptors and of FcγRIIa, which has been shown previously to be wortmannin-sensitive (17Ninomiya N. Hazeki K. Fukui Y. Seya T. Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22732-22737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of inhibition varied between a 70% to 85% decrease in the phagocytic index as compared with untreated cells (Table III, part B). Binding of the IgG-opsonized RBC as measured by rosetting was unaffected by wortmannin treatment (0–2% change).DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that chimeric Fcγ receptors with cytoplasmic tails composed of domains of the p85 subunit of PI3-K trigger phagocytosis in COS fibroblasts. Specifically, chimeric FcγR containing either the entire p85 subunit of PI3-K or the inter-SH2 portion that conveys constitutive enzymatic activity to the p110 subunit of PI3-K (26Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) were phagocytically active when expressed in COS cells and showed phosphoinositide kinase activity in vitrowhen immunoadsorbed. In contrast, a chimera composed of the SH2-C region of p85 that does not interact with the p110 subunit did not trigger significant phagocytosis nor did it show PI3-K activityin vitro. These data, combined with our observation that the mediation of phagocytosis by both of these chimeras was inhibited by wortmannin, would indicate that the enzymatic activity of PI3-K is a critical mediator of phagocytosis and that the other adaptor domains of p85 are not essential for this function. Furthermore, our results would indicate that specific upstream signaling molecules essential for PI3-K recruitment to the active receptor complex can be effectively bypassed. Specifically, neither FcR γ-chain with its ITAM, nor the Src kinase responsible for ITAM phosphorylation, nor the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Syk would appear to be required for the phagocytic responses that we have measured. Simple localization and direct activation of PI3-K at the site of particle attachment appears to be sufficient to trigger the process of phagocytosis in COS cells. Our findings thus implicate the products of PI3-K enzymatic activity as central messengers in activating the process of phagocytosis.For the purpose of this study, we have defined the term phagocytosis to be particle internalization inhibited by cytochalasin D as judged by phase and fluorescence microscopy. We did not examine further subtleties of the phagocytic process such as the ultrastructural details of phagosome formation, the movement of targets to lysosomes, and the possible modulation of phosphoinositide kinase activity. Our data, therefore, do not rule out the contributions of other signaling"

DNA binding domain polymerase chain reaction electrophoretic mobility shift assay dimethyl sulfate. The GAGA factor of Drosophila is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that participates in a variety of different chromosomal functions (for reviews see Refs. 1Granok H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3963-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). GAGA has been shown to stimulate transcription of some developmentally regulated homeotic genes and heat shock genes (3Biggin M.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 53: 699-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 4O'Brien T. Wilkins R.C. Giardina C. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1098-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and GAGA-binding sites are found at the promoters of numerous Drosophila genes (1Granok H. Leibovitch B.A. Shaffer C.D. Elgin S.C.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 238-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggesting a general role of GAGA in transcription regulation. Although its actual mechanism of action is not yet fully understood, it is believed that, at least to some extent, GAGA functions at the level of chromatin structure, participating in nucleosome remodeling at the promoter regions (5Tsukiyama T. Becker P. Wu C. Nature. 1994; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 6Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 1011-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role at the level of chromatin structure, GAGA is a modifier of position effect variegation (7Farkas G. Gausz J. Galloni M. Reuter G. Gyurkovics H. Karch F. Nature. 1994; 371: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A link to chromatin structure is also indicated by its association with heterochromatin (8Raff J.W. Kellum R. Alberts B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5977-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GAGA is found associated with the centromeric heterochromatin in mitotic, but not in polytene, chromosomes (9Platero J.S. Csink A.K. Quintanilla A. Henikoff S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); some GAGA mutants show mitotic defects (10Bhat K.M. Farkas G. Karch F. Gyurkovics H. Gausz J. Scheld P. Development. 1996; 122: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role of GAGA in chromosome condensation and/or segregation. GAGA binds to repeated d(GA·TC)n DNA sequences. In general, GAGA-binding sites found at promoters are short, with a consensus of 3.5 dinucleotide repeats, and multiple (1Granok H. Leibovitch B.A. Shaffer C.D. Elgin S.C.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 238-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In some promoters, however, long binding sites are also observed (i.e. hsp26, hsp70, his3, and his4) (1Granok H. Leibovitch B.A. Shaffer C.D. Elgin S.C.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 238-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Gilmour D.S. Thomas G.H. Elgin S.C.R. Science. 1989; 245: 1487-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, the association of GAGA with heterochromatin occurs mainly through its binding to the (AAGAG)n and (AAGAGAG)nsatellites (8Raff J.W. Kellum R. Alberts B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5977-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which constitute extremely long arrays of consecutive GAGA-binding sites. Repeated d(GA·TC)n DNA sequences are structurally polymorphic being capable of adopting different non-B-DNA conformations (for reviews see Refs. 12Bernués J. Azorı́n F. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1995; 9: 1-21Crossref Google Scholar and 13Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In particular, they form triple-stranded conformations which, depending on the experimental conditions, are of the d[CT(GA·TC)]n or the d[AG(GA·TC)]n type. In addition, d(GA·TC)nsequences can also form d(GA·GA)n intramolecular homoduplexes, leaving the CT strand single-stranded (14Beltrán R. Martı́nez-Balbás Á. Bernués J. Bowater R. Azorı́n F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 966-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Martı́nez-Balbás Á. Azorı́n F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2557-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this paper we address the question of as to what extent the interaction of GAGA with DNA is affected by the conformational polymorphism of its binding site. Our results indicate that GAGA can bind to triple-stranded DNA with an affinity only slightly lower than the double-stranded DNA and that the DNA binding domain (residues 310–391) is sufficient for efficient binding to triplex DNA. The interaction of GAGA with triplex DNA is as specific as with duplex DNA but, contrary to the interaction with duplex DNA, the GAGA triplex complex is not transcriptionally competent in vitro. These results have implications for our understanding of the way GAGA recognizes DNA as well as of the biological consequences of this interaction. Recombinant GAGA protein was a generous gift from Dr. C. Wu. It corresponds to gaga519 form (16Soeller W.C. Oh C.E. Kornberg T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7961-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and was expressed as a non-tagged polypeptide in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)-LysS. The protein was purified as described elsewhere (17Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The GAGA-DBD1 coding sequence (residues 310–391 of the GAGA protein) was generated by PCR as anNdeI-BamHI fragment from plasmid pET11D/GAGA1 (18Pedone P.V. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Felsenfeld G. Omichinski J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2822-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. G. Felsenfeld. This DNA fragment was cloned into the pET14-b vector and expressed as a 6× His-tagged protein in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-LysE. The recombinant protein was purified in a Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen). Fragments GA22 and ΔGA were obtained from the corresponding pUC18-modified plasmids (19Espinás M.L. Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Martı́nez-Balbás Á. Azorı́n F. J. Biol.

Fragment IA22 was obtained by PCR amplification of fragment GA22 performed in the presence of dITP in substitution of dGTP. DNA fragments carrying intermolecular triplexes were obtained by annealing the corresponding double-stranded fragments with a 10-fold excess (w/w) of either a d(CT)22 oligonucleotide, for the YGA22 and YIA22 triplexes, or a d(AG)22 oligonucleotide in the case of the RGA22 triplexes. Incubation was performed at 58 °C for 2 h in a water bath and then allowed to cool down slowly to room temperature. YGA22 and YIA22 triplexes were formed in TK buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 50 mm KCl) and RGA22 triplex in TKM buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2). A synthetic oligonucleotide of sequence d(AGA2 (GA)4A GAT4 TCT2 (CT)4 TCT T6TC T2(CT)4 TCT) was used to analyze the interaction of GAGA with intramolecular triplexes. In this case, the triplex was formed in TK buffer by heating the oligonucleotide to 90 °C for 5 min and allowed to cool down slowly to room temperature. For EMSA experiments the32P-labeled DNA fragments were incubated with GAGA or GAGA-DBD in TK buffer in the presence of 10 μg of BSA and a 100-fold excess (w/w), with respect to the labeled fragment, of E. coli DNA as nonspecific competitor for 20 min at room temperature in a final volume of 15 μl. When the affinity for the RGA22 triplexes was determined incubation was performed under the same conditions but in TKM buffer. To compare the results obtained with different protein preparations, the amount of protein used in each experiment is expressed as units of activity defined as the amount of protein inducing about 50% retardation of 1 ng of fragment GA22 in a buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol. GAGA-DNA complexes were analyzed on 0.8% agarose, 0.5× TBE gels, and complexes formed with GAGA-DBD were run on native 4.5% polyacrylamide, 0.5× TBE gels. For competition experiments, incubation was carried out under the same experimental conditions but in the presence of increasing amounts of the corresponding competitor DNA, as indicated in each case. Footprinting reactions were carried out under the same buffer conditions used for the EMSA experiments after incubation with the amount of protein indicated in each case. For DMS modification, samples were chilled on ice for 10 min prior to the addition of 1 μl of DMS (Sigma) to a final volume of 20–50 μl. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 min on ice and then stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 1m β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were ethanol-precipitated twice, resuspended in 90 μl of water, treated with 1 mpiperidine for 30 min at 90 °C, and analyzed in 7% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gels. For DNase I digestion, samples were digested with 0.01 units of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 min at room temperature in a final volume of 20 μl. The enzyme was added in 8 mm MgCl2, 4 mm CaCl2 and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of a solution containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5% SDS. Samples were purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and analyzed in 7% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gels. For the in vitro transcription experiments whole HeLa nuclear extracts, prepared according to Ref. 20Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, were used as a source of general transcription factors. The GA22 template was constructed by inserting a d(GA·TC)22 sequence, derived from plasmid pE/CT22 (21Casasnovas J.M. Ellison M.J. Rodrı́guez-Campos A. Azorı́n F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), at position −50 of the minimal AdML promoter linked to a 190-base pair G-less cassette. Triplex DNA templates were assembled as described above by annealing 1 μg of d(CT)22oligonucleotide to 1 μg of a GA22 template for 2 h at 58 °C in TK buffer. The efficient formation of triplex DNA, and its persistence under the experimental conditions for in vitrotranscription, was determined by footprinting (not shown). Transcription reactions were performed as described before (22Bernués J. Simmen K.A. Lewis J.D. Gunderson S.I. Polycarpou- Schwarz M. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3573-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using 400 ng of linear template DNAs and 450 μg of nuclear extract. Reactions were performed in the presence of purified recombinant GAGA protein at the concentrations indicated in each case. Reactions were allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 60 min. Prior to phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, unrelated labeled fragments were added to the samples as recovery controls. For competition experiments, recombinant GAGA protein was preincubated for 15 min at 30 °C with 400 ng of the corresponding competitor DNA in Dignam's D buffer (0.1m KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Then nuclear extract, templates, and nucleotides were added, and the reactions were allowed to proceed for 60 min as above. In these experiments, linearized pE/CT22, carrying a d(GA·TC)22 sequence either as double-stranded DNA (GA22*) or as an intermolecular d[CT(GA·TC)]22 triplex (YGA22*), was used as specific competitor. Linearized pE/0 plasmid DNA, which is identical to pE/CT22 but missing the d(GA·TC)22 sequence (21Casasnovas J.M. Ellison M.J. Rodrı́guez-Campos A. Azorı́n F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), was used as unspecific competitor (ΔGA*). The model of the complex of GAGA-DBD with triplex DNA was generated from the coordinates of the solution structure of the complex formed with duplex DNA (23Omichinski J.G. Pedone P.V. Felsenfeld G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and a molecular dynamics averaged structure of a d[CT(GA·TC)]10triplex. As described in detail elsewhere (24Soliva, R., Laughton, C. A., Luque, F. J., and Orozco, M. (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc., in pressGoogle Scholar), the structure of the triplex was obtained by averaging during the last 0.5 ns of a 1.15-ns molecular dynamics trajectory of a fully hydrated triplex. The trajectory was fully stable during 1 ns at 300 K and 1 atm. Docking was performed to maximize the protein-DNA interactions while preserving as much as possible the conformation of the protein, specially of the zinc finger motif, as well as the protein-DNA contacts observed with duplex DNA. The model was refined by restrain minimization using AMBER force-field (25Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar). The interaction of GAGA with triple-stranded DNA was analyzed by EMSA. Fig. 1 A summarizes the DNA fragments used in these experiments. Fragment GA22 carries a repeated d(GA·TC)22 sequence that, in fragment YGA22, is forming an intermolecular d[CT(GA·TC)]22 triplex through its association with a d(CT)22 oligonucleotide (see “Experimental Procedures”). The formation of this intermolecular triplex is very efficient, as reflected by the intense DNase I and DMS footprints observed over the d(GA·TC)22 sequence (Fig. 2 panels YGA22, lanes 0). Fragment ΔGA has exactly the same nucleotide sequence as fragment GA22 but is missing the central d(GA·TC)22 sequence. As shown in Fig. 1 B, GAGA binds to the triplex containing fragment YGA22 with a similar affinity to fragment GA22 which carries the d(GA·TC)22 sequence in the regular double-stranded B-DNA conformation. As judged from the percentage of complex formed at increasing protein concentration, the affinity of GAGA for fragment YGA22 is only slightly lower, around 3-fold, than for fragment GA22. Binding of GAGA to fragment YGA22 does not result in the release of the d(CT)22 oligonucleotide from the complex. Fig. 1 C shows the DNA content corresponding to the complex obtained after binding of GAGA to fragment YGA22. In this experiment, the intermolecular d[CT(GA·TC)]22 triplex was formed with both DNA molecules, the GA22 fragment and the d(CT)22oligonucleotide, radioactively labeled, and after formation of the complex with GAGA, the retarded band was cut off from the gel and its DNA composition analyzed by gel electrophoresis under conditions where the triplex is not stable. In the GAGA-YGA22 complex, fragments GA22 and d(CT)22 are both present (Fig. 1 C, lane 1) at about 1:1 molar ratio as judged by the comparison of the intensities of the corresponding bands recovered from the complex with those of a mixture of this stoichiometry (Fig. 1 C, lane C). These results suggest that the d[CT(GA·TC)]22 triplex of fragment YGA22 is preserved upon binding of GAGA. The patterns of DNase I and DMS footprinting of the GAGA-YGA22 complex corroborate the preservation of the triplex (Fig. 2). Formation of triple-stranded DNA provides by itself intense DNase I and DMS footprints which, in fragment YGA22, span the repeated d(GA·TC)22 sequence (Fig. 2, A and B, compare lanes 0 in panels GA22 with lanes 0 in panels YGA22). These triplex footprints are accompanied by hypersensitive sites located 3′ of the triplex region which are especially strong in the case of DMS. The patterns of DNase I and DMS footprinting of fragment YGA22 do not show any significant differences when obtained in the presence of increasing amounts of GAGA (Fig. 2, A and B, panels YGA22 lanes 1–4). The triplex footprints are detected even at high protein concentration (Fig. 2, A and B, panels YGA22 lanes 4) when, as judged by EMSA, fragment YGA22 is fully retarded (Fig. 1 B, panel YGA22, lane 4). In the case of fragment GA22, very clear footprints are also detected over the d(GA·TC)22 sequence upon increasing the protein concentration (Fig. 2, A and B, panels GA22, lanes 1–3). However, these GAGA-footprints are different from the triplex footprints observed in the case of fragment YGA22, the main difference being the absence of the 3′-hypersensitive sites on the former (Fig. 2, A and B, compare lanes 3 in panels GA22 withlanes 1–4 in panels YGA22). Binding of GAGA to the YGA22 fragment occurs over the d[CT(GA·TC)]22triplex since no footprints are observed outside of the triplex region (Fig. 2, panels YGA22) and, furthermore, no binding to fragment ΔGA can be detected by either EMSA (Fig. 1 B, panel ΔGA) or DNase I or DMS footprinting (Fig. 2, A and B, panels ΔGA). All these results indicate that GAGA binds to the intermolecular d[CT(GA·TC)]22 triplex of fragment YGA22 with a similar affinity that to the double-stranded d(GA·TC)22 DNA sequence of fragment GA22.Figure 2DMS (A) and DNase I footprinting (B) analysis of the binding of GAGA to fragments GA22, YGA22, and ΔGA as a function of increasing protein concentration.

Ghirlando R. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Felsenfeld G. Omichinski J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2822-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). GAGA-DBD binds to the triplex containing YGA22 fragment with an affinity that, as found with full GAGA, is only slightly lower, around 2.5-fold, than that for double-stranded DNA (Fig. 3 A). On increasing binding of GAGA-DBD to fragment GA22, up to four discrete bands of decreasing electrophoretic mobility can be detected, indicating that the d(GA·TC)22 sequence of fragment GA22 can accommodate a maximum of four GAGA-DBD molecules. Interestingly, the triplex containing fragment YGA22 can also bind the same number of GAGA-DBD molecules. As in the case of full GAGA, the patterns of DNase I and DMS footprinting of fragment YGA22 do not change significantly upon binding of GAGA-DBD (Fig. 3 B) reflecting, also in this case, the presence of the intermolecular d[CT(GA·TC)]22 triplex in the protein-DNA complex. In this case, the DMS footprints are particularly informative since the GAGA-DBD footprints observed over the double-stranded d(GA·TC)22 sequence of fragment GA22 are very faint (Fig. 3 B, panel DMS-GA22). On the contrary, in the case of fragment YGA22, a very intense triplex footprint is observed even at the highest protein concentration tested (Fig. 3 B, panel DMS-YGA22, lane 3) when more than 95% of fragment YGA22 is retarded (Fig. 3 A, panel YGA22, lane 3). As judged by EMSA, GAGA-DBD shows a slight binding to fragment ΔGA that, at the highest protein concentration tested, results in about 20% retardation (Fig. 3 A, panel ΔGA, lane 1). These results indicate that, although missing the d(GA·TC)22 sequence, fragment ΔGA contains some GAGA-DBD-binding sites of low affinity. However, the affinity of GAGA-DBD for the triplex-containing fragment YGA22 is much higher than for fragment ΔGA (Fig. 3 A) indicating that, in fragment YGA22, the main GAGA-DBD-binding site corresponds to the d[CT(GA·TC)]22 intermolecular triplex. In agreement with this interpretation, no footprints are observed outside of the triplex region (Fig. 3 B, panels YGA22 and GA22). Actually, no footprints are detected either on fragment ΔGA (Fig. 3 B, panels ΔGA) indicating that, even in fragment ΔGA, the occupancy of the cryptic GAGA-DBD-binding sites is very low. Furthermore, full GAGA does not appear to recognize these sites of low affinity since, even at high protein concentration, no significant binding to fragment ΔGA can be detected (Fig. 1 B, panel ΔGA, lane 2). Similar results were obtained when the binding of GAGA-DBD to a synthetic oligonucleotide folding into an intramolecular d[(AGA2(GA)4 A2GA·TCT2(CT)4T2CT)TCT2(CT)4T2CT] triplex was analyzed. As judged by EMSA and DNase I footprinting (not shown), GAGA-DBD is also capable of binding to this intramolecular triplex that, upon formation of the complex, shows no signs of unfolding. Altogether, these results indicate that the ability of GAGA to bind triple-stranded DNA resides in the same protein domain responsible for its interaction with regular double-stranded B-form DNA. The specificity of the interaction of GAGA with triple-stranded DNA was determined through competition experiments (Fig. 4) in which binding of GAGA-DBD to the triplex containing fragment YGA22, or the regular double-stranded DNA fragment GA22, was competed with either YGA22 or GA22, as specific competitors, and E. coli DNA, or fragment ΔGA, as nonspecific competitors. Binding to the triplex containing fragment YGA22 is competed with a higher efficiency (about 10-fold higher) by the specific competitors than by the nonspecific ones (Fig. 4 A). Similar results were obtained when the competition for binding to the double-stranded GA22 fragment was determined. Also in this case, a similar difference in competition efficiency between the specific and nonspecific competitors is detected (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that the interaction of GAGA-DBD with triple-stranded DNA is as specific as its interaction with double-stranded DNA. Similar results were obtained with full GAGA (not shown). The results shown before indicate that GAGA binds the intermolecular d[CT(GA·TC)]22 triplex with significant affinity and specificity. GAGA binds also to intermolecular d[CT(IA·TC)]n triplexes. Fig. 5 shows the binding of GAGA to fragment YIA22 which carries an intermolecular d[CT(IA·TC)]22triplex formed by the association of a d(CT)22oligonucleotide with fragment IA22 which contains a d(IA·TC)22 sequence in place of the d(GA·TC)22 sequence. Fragment IA22 was obtained by PCR amplification of fragment GA22 performed in the presence of dITP in substitution of dGTP. In these experiments, the GA22 fragment of YGA22 was also obtained by PCR amplification performed simultaneously to the attainment of fragment IA22 and under the same conditions, except that regular dGTP was used. As judged by EMSA, GAGA binds to the YIA22 fragment with similar efficiency as to fragment YGA22 (Fig. 5 A). Preservation of the d[CT(IA·TC)]22triplex in the GAGA-YIA22 complex was shown by DMS footprinting which detects intense triplex footprints even at the highest protein concentration used (Fig. 5 B). These results show that GAGA has a similar affinity for the d[CT(IA·TC)]22 and the d[CT(GA·TC)]22 triplexes. The main difference between these two types of triplexes is the absence in the former of the guanine N 2-amino groups that are located in the narrow groove. Therefore, these results indicate that the interaction of GAGA with triple-stranded DNA is rather insensitive to the presence of these groups in the narrow groove. GAGA, however, does not recognize all triplexes with the same affinity. It is known that d(GA·TC)n sequences can also form d[AG(GA·TC)]n triplexes in which the third strand is homopurine. Fig. 6 shows the binding of GAGA to fragment RGA22 which carries a d[AG(GA·TC)]22intermolecular triplex formed by the association of fragment GA22 with a d(GA)22 oligonucleotide. As determined by DMS and DNase I footprinting (not shown), this intermolecular triplex is stable in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2. In the presence of magnesium, the d[CT(GA·TC)]22 triplex of fragment YGA22 was also found to be stable (not shown). Under these ionic conditions, the protein concentration required to induce a significant retardation of fragment GA22 is higher (Fig. 6, panel GA22) than in the absence of magnesium (Fig. 1 B, panel GA22) indicating that, in the presence of magnesium, the general affinity of GAGA for DNA drops significantly, about 2-fold. In the presence of magnesium, GAGA shows a low but still significant affinity for fragment YGA22, carrying the d[CT(GA·TC)]22 intermolecular triplex (Fig. 6,panel YGA22), but, on the other hand, its binding to fragment RGA22 is less efficient (Fig. 6, panel RGA22) indicating that the affinity of GAGA for the d[AG(GA·TC)]22 triplex is significantly lower than for the d[CT(GA·TC)]22 triplex. Therefore, the interaction of GAGA with triple-stranded DNA appears to be sensitive to the nature of the third strand which occupies the major groove of the duplex. GAGA is known to enhance transcription from promoters containing d(GA·TC)n sequences, both in vitro and in vivo (16Soeller W.C. Oh C.E. Kornberg T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7961-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Croston G.E. Kerrigan L.A. Lira L.M. Marshak D.R. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1991; 251: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 27Kerrigan L.A. Croston G.E. Lira L.M. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 574-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since GAGA can also bind triple-stranded DNA, we asked the question of whether GAGA activates transcription when binding to triplex DNA. For this purpose a d(GA·TC)22 sequence was fused to the minimal AdML promoter which was driving the expression of a G-less cassette (Fig. 7 A). This construct was tested in an in vitro transcription assay in the presence of increasing amounts of GAGA using a whole HeLa nuclear extract as a source of general transcription factors (Fig. 7 B). Addition of GAGA results in an increased transcription rate from the promoter containing the d(GA·TC)22 sequence (Fig. 7 B, panel GA22, lanes 1 and 2) that, at the highest protein concentration tested, was about 7.5-fold higher with respect to the rate observed in the absence of protein (Fig. 7 B, panel GA22 lane 0). This effect depends on the presence of the d(GA·TC)22 sequence at the promoter since addition of GAGA does not result in increased transcription from the minimal AdML promoter (Fig. 7 B, panel AdML). Actually, in this case, the rate of transcription decreases upon the addition of GAGA likely as a consequence of the squelching of general transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 28Ptashne M. Gann A.A.F. Nature. 1990; 346: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). When the d(GA·TC)22 sequence contained within the promoter was forming an intermolecular d[CT(GA·TC)]22 triplex, addition of GAGA did not result in any significant increase in transcription (Fig. 7 B, panel YGA22). In the presence of the triplex, the rate of transcription is always very low and insensitive to the presence of GAGA. These results suggest that either GAGA does not bind to triplex DNA under the conditio"

Using reactivity to KMnO4 in vivo as an assay, we find that, like initiation, origin opening of the Escherichia coli plasmid P1 requires the host initiators DnaA and HU and the plasmid-encoded initiator RepA. The ability to detect opening at the P1ori in vivo allowed us to study this activity at various copy numbers in chimeric replicons. The opening was prevented when the P1ori was cloned in high copy vectors or when excess RepA binding sites (iterons) were provided in trans. However, when RepA supply was also increased, the opening was efficient. A further increase in RepA prevented opening. Replication of an incoming P1 under these conditions correlated with opening. These results demonstrate that initiation is possible even at abnormally high origin concentrations and that oversupply of RepA, relative to iterons, can prevent replication by blocking origin opening. It appears that plasmid overreplication can be prevented either by limiting RepA or by accumulating RepA at a rate higher than that of the origin.

Initiation of DNA replication has been staged into discrete steps primarily from the work in vitro on plasmids carrying theEscherichia coli origin, oriC. Binding of initiators first opens the origin, and the opening provides the stage for the DnaC-mediated loading of the DnaB helicase (1Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 54: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the absence of the DnaB-DnaC complex, a stable open state of the origin could be obtained in vitro. Using a dnaC(ts) mutant host at the nonpermissive temperature, a stable open structure could also be obtained in vivo as assayed by reactivity to KMnO4 (2Gille H. Messer W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Reactivity was lost rapidly when the culture was shifted down to permissive temperature. It appears that once DnaB is loaded, the subsequent steps of priming and elongation can proceed rapidly and are unlikely to be the steps for controlling initiation frequency.We have examined whether origin opening of plasmid P1 can be used to follow regulation of initiation in vivo. Plasmid P1 belongs to a family of plasmids characterized by the presence of short repeating sequences, called iterons (3Chattoraj D.K. Schneider T.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 145-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The iterons are binding sites for the plasmid-encoded initiator, RepA. Iterons cover about half of the minimal origin (ori) of P1 and also constitute the control locus, incA (see Fig. 1). The incA locus can be deleted, and such plasmids are maintained at an 8-fold higher copy number. The locus therefore plays only a negative regulatory role in plasmid replication. The origin iterons (called incC; see Fig. 1) are essential for initiation and are believed to be important for the control of copy number as well. The incC locus also includes the promoter of the initiator gene. Consequently, RepA binding to incC results in efficient repression of the RepA promoter. Autoregulated initiator synthesis is generally a conserved feature of iteron-carrying plasmids, implying that maintenance of initiator concentration is critical to the copy number control process.We find that the requirements for the appearance of KMnO4-reactive bases in P1ori are well correlated with the genetic determinants of P1 plasmid replication. Two host proteins, DnaA and HU (4Hansen E.B. Yarmolinsky M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4423-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Ogura T. Niki H. Kano Y. Imamoto F. Hiraga S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and P1 RepA (6Austin S.J. Mural R.J. Chattoraj D.K. Abeles A.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) are essential for initiation of P1 replication, and excess iterons or excess RepA inhibit P1 replication (7Papp P.P. Mukhopadhyay G. Chattoraj D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23563-23568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol.

These characteristics of plasmid replication were found to be also true for the opening reaction, validating the use of the opening assay to study initiation control.We show that normally inhibitory concentrations of cloned origins or iterons were tolerated both for opening as well as replication, provided RepA concentration was correspondingly high. Further increases of RepA can be inhibitory. Thus, under the conditions of our experiments, the inhibitory activities of iterons and RepA depend upon their relative concentrations.DISCUSSIONHere we show that opening of the P1 plasmid origin in vivo can be detected efficiently by probing with KMnO4, provided the DnaB helicase loading to the origin is blocked. This has been achieved either by inactivating DnaC (2Gille H. Messer W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or by sequestering DnaB with λP protein (17Mallory J.B. Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13297-13307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The opening was taken to represent initiation of DNA replication for the following reasons. It 1) required the presence of all three proteins that are essential for plasmid replication: host initiators DnaA and HU and plasmid-encoded initiator RepA, 2) was site-specific, localized to an A+T-rich region of the origin, 3) was transient, because it reversed when the block to DnaB loading was lifted, and 4) was regulated by iterons and RepA, the known regulators of P1 plasmid replication.Opening of plasmid origins has been studied primarily in vitro. For P1, some opening was observed with DnaA alone (25Mukhopadhyay G. Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Chattoraj D.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4547-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RepA alone was not effective, but it greatly stimulated opening when present together with DnaA. Results were similar with miniF plasmids except that these experiments also included HU (26Kawasaki Y. Matsunaga F. Kano Y. Yura T. Wada C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although individually ineffective, a combination of RepE (the P1 RepA equivalent) and HU allowed opening, which was further stimulated by DnaA. Results were different for plasmid RK2 in one respect (27Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). DnaA alone, which was effective in opening the P1 and F origins, was ineffective for the RK2 origin. From our present results in vivo, it is seen that any of the pairwise combinations of DnaA, HU, and RepA were insufficient. A reproducible signal required cooperation of all three proteins, indicating that one reason the three are essential in replication is for opening the origin.The ability to detect opening allowed us to study P1oriactivity at various copy numbers in chimeric replicons and test the applicability of models that have been proposed for the negative feedback control of plasmid copy number by iterons. In the initiator titration model, the concentration of plasmid-encoded initiator protein that binds the iterons is assumed to be limiting (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Chattoraj D. Cordes K. Abeles A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6456-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Pal S.K. Mason R.J. Chattoraj D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Tsutsui H.

With increase of copy number, the limiting amount of initiator is believed to distribute to different origins, preventing saturation of any one origin. Thus, the increase of origin (or, more precisely, iteron) concentration relative to initiator provides the negative feedback signal. The model was questioned when extra initiators did not increase copy number significantly in many iteron-carrying plasmids: R6K (30Filutowicz M. McEachern M.J. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9645-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), P1 (21Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RK2 (31Durland R.H. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3849-3858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pSC101 (32Ingmer H. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7834-7841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Rts1 (33Terawaki Y. Nozue H. Zeng H. Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Itoh Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 786-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although not R1162 (34Kim K. Meyer R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).A second model, the handcuffing model, is based on the finding that the initiators can pair iterons in trans (21Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35McEachern M.J. Bott M.A. Tooker P.A. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7942-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the pairing causes a steric hindrance to origin activity, increases with increased origin (iteron) concentration and cannot be relieved by increasing the concentration of RepA. As discussed above, this model was invoked when the titration model was found inadequate to explain insensitivity of copy number to increases of initiator concentration.A third mode of control is conspicuous in some members of iteron-carrying plasmids: R6K (30Filutowicz M. McEachern M.J. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9645-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), P1 (21Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pSC101 (32Ingmer H. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7834-7841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Rts1 (33Terawaki Y. Nozue H. Zeng H. Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Itoh Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 786-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these plasmids, a modest increase of initiator concentration was shown to lead to a decrease in copy number. The mechanism of this mode of control is not clear, but in principle such a mechanism can be an alternative to handcuffing in restraining copy number when RepA concentration becomes excessive.The results of the present paper are most easily explained by the initiator titration model. When the P1ori was cloned into the pUC19 vector with a copy number about 2.5-fold higher than that normally achieved by miniP1 plasmids (in the absence of theincA locus), the origins could still be opened but required higher concentrations of RepA (Fig. 4 B). Such a high concentration of P1ori also did not inhibit replication of an incoming λminiP1 plasmid prophage when extra RepA was provided (Table II). These results are consistent with the conclusion from a different set of experiments that origins are poor inhibitors of each other when RepA supply is adequate (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D.

A. 1991; 88: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The inhibitory activity of iterons is clearly seen when they are not part of intact origins (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Chattoraj D. Cordes K. Abeles A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6456-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or when the origin is not functional as in high copy plasmid chimeras used here (Tables I and II). In some of these experiments, RepA was supplied from an autoregulatory source. One might expect that an autoregulatory source of RepA could promptly compensate for RepA titration. Were that true, the observed inhibition might be attributed to handcuffing. Experiments designed to determine the extent to which titration of RepA by iterons results in additional RepA synthesis showed that the induction of RepA was inefficient (20Chattoraj D.K. Mason R.J. Wickner S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 551-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This was also observed in the present studies (Tables I and II). The autoregulated source of RepA present in λminiP1 did not supply enough RepA to overcome inhibition by extra incC. The inhibition was overcome when extra RepA was provided from a constitutive promoter. One reason for inadequate RepA supply from the autoregulated source could be due to the capacity of iteron-bound RepA to repressprepA by RepA-mediated handcuffing (20Chattoraj D.K. Mason R.J. Wickner S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 551-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In experiments where the source of RepA was not autoregulatory and iteron-mediated inhibition prevails irrespective of the quantity of RepA supply, handcuffing remains the most satisfactory explanation (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,21Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Abeles A.L. Austin S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Even in experiments where the inhibition was overcome by oversupply of RepA (e.g. pBR322+incA, Fig. 4 A; pACYC184+incC, Table I; and pUC19+incC, Table II) and the results are adequately explained by titration, it is possible that handcuffing could have operated at steps after origin opening in experiments where replication was blocked (Fig. 4 A) or replication of vector could have interfered with handcuffing (Tables I and II). Similar ambiguity remains in some of our previous experiments where initiator titration appeared to be the simplest explanation. In one, incAinhibition of integrative suppression by λminiP1 was overcome by extra RepA (15Chattoraj D. Cordes K. Abeles A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6456-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the other, a block to lysogeny by λP1ori was overcome by extra RepA (21Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as in the present experiments (Tables I and II). In both of these experiments,incA was chromosomally located, and chromosomal replication could have interfered with handcuffing. Thus it is possible to accommodate most of our results as not contradicting the handcuffing model, if the conditions under which handcuffing operates are sufficiently constrained.How is the copy number of incA-deleted miniP1 plasmids controlled? If origins per se are not inhibitory to each other at high concentrations, the copy number could be limited by the availability of RepA or by some essential host factor(s) (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We already discussed that RepA supply from an autoregulated source could be limiting. Because RepA requires chaperones for activity (37Chattoraj D.K. Genet. Eng.17. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 81-98Google Scholar), their availability could be limiting. Another possibility could be that the supply of too much RepA limits copy number because of an accumulated inhibitor synthesized concomitantly with RepA.That the inhibitor is not RepA itself is suggested by two lines of evidence. Mutating the translation start codon of repAreduces RepA production drastically but not the synthesis of a replication inhibitor (9Muraiso K. Mukhopadhyay G. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also excess of purified RepA does not cause replication inhibition in vitro (36Abeles A.L. Austin S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 38Wickner S.H. Chattoraj D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When we exceeded the normal copy number of incA-deleted miniP1 in chimeric replicons, the normally inhibitory level of RepA synthesis was not inhibitory, most likely because the inhibitor distributed to different origins. Thus the relative rather than absolute levels of inhibitors and origins seem to be more important, and accumulating RepA at a rate higher than the increase of copy number can be a potential means to prevent runaway replication.In summary, it appears that in addition to relative concentrations of RepA and iterons, there are probably other players in copy number control. We are interested to know whether the inhibition of replication that is seen when RepA is artificially overproduced happens under normal circumstances. An understanding of the nature and mode of action of the inhibitor(s) may help also to determine the conditions that favor handcuffing and those that favor titration. Initiation of DNA replication has been staged into discrete steps primarily from the work in vitro on plasmids carrying theEscherichia coli origin, oriC. Binding of initiators first opens the origin, and the opening provides the stage for the DnaC-mediated loading of the DnaB helicase (1Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 54: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the absence of the DnaB-DnaC complex, a stable open state of the origin could be obtained in vitro. Using a dnaC(ts) mutant host at the nonpermissive temperature, a stable open structure could also be obtained in vivo as assayed by reactivity to KMnO4 (2Gille H. Messer W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Reactivity was lost rapidly when the culture was shifted down to permissive temperature. It appears that once DnaB is loaded, the subsequent steps of priming and elongation can proceed rapidly and are unlikely to be the steps for controlling initiation frequency. We have examined whether origin opening of plasmid P1 can be used to follow regulation of initiation in vivo. Plasmid P1 belongs to a family of plasmids characterized by the presence of short repeating sequences, called iterons (3Chattoraj D.K. Schneider T.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 145-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The iterons are binding sites for the plasmid-encoded initiator, RepA. Iterons cover about half of the minimal origin (ori) of P1 and also constitute the control locus, incA (see Fig. 1). The incA locus can be deleted, and such plasmids are maintained at an 8-fold higher copy number. The locus therefore plays only a negative regulatory role in plasmid replication. The origin iterons (called incC; see Fig. 1) are essential for initiation and are believed to be important for the control of copy number as well. The incC locus also includes the promoter of the initiator gene. Consequently, RepA binding to incC results in efficient repression of the RepA promoter. Autoregulated initiator synthesis is generally a conserved feature of iteron-carrying plasmids, implying that maintenance of initiator concentration is critical to the copy number control process. We find that the requirements for the appearance of KMnO4-reactive bases in P1ori are well correlated with the genetic determinants of P1 plasmid replication. Two host proteins, DnaA and HU (4Hansen E.B. Yarmolinsky M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4423-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Ogura T. Niki H. Kano Y. Imamoto F. Hiraga S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and P1 RepA (6Austin S.J. Mural R.J. Chattoraj D.K. Abeles A.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) are essential for initiation of P1 replication, and excess iterons or excess RepA inhibit P1 replication (7Papp P.P. Mukhopadhyay G. Chattoraj D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23563-23568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Muraiso K. Mukhopadhyay G. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These characteristics of plasmid replication were found to be also true for the opening reaction, validating the use of the opening assay to study initiation control. We show that normally inhibitory concentrations of cloned origins or iterons were tolerated both for opening as well as replication, provided RepA concentration was correspondingly high. Further increases of RepA can be inhibitory. Thus, under the conditions of our experiments, the inhibitory activities of iterons and RepA depend upon their relative concentrations. DISCUSSIONHere we show that opening of the P1 plasmid origin in vivo can be detected efficiently by probing with KMnO4, provided the DnaB helicase loading to the origin is blocked. This has been achieved either by inactivating DnaC (2Gille H. Messer W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or by sequestering DnaB with λP protein (17Mallory J.B. Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13297-13307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The opening was taken to represent initiation of DNA replication for the following reasons. It 1) required the presence of all three proteins that are essential for plasmid replication: host initiators DnaA and HU and plasmid-encoded initiator RepA, 2) was site-specific, localized to an A+T-rich region of the origin, 3) was transient, because it reversed when the block to DnaB loading was lifted, and 4) was regulated by iterons and RepA, the known regulators of P1 plasmid replication.Opening of plasmid origins has been studied primarily in vitro. For P1, some opening was observed with DnaA alone (25Mukhopadhyay G. Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Chattoraj D.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4547-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RepA alone was not effective, but it greatly stimulated opening when present together with DnaA. Results were similar with miniF plasmids except that these experiments also included HU (26Kawasaki Y. Matsunaga F. Kano Y. Yura T. Wada C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although individually ineffective, a combination of RepE (the P1 RepA equivalent) and HU allowed opening, which was further stimulated by DnaA. Results were different for plasmid RK2 in one respect (27Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). DnaA alone, which was effective in opening the P1 and F origins, was ineffective for the RK2 origin. From our present results in vivo, it is seen that any of the pairwise combinations of DnaA, HU, and RepA were insufficient. A reproducible signal required cooperation of all three proteins, indicating that one reason the three are essential in replication is for opening the origin.The ability to detect opening allowed us to study P1oriactivity at various copy numbers in chimeric replicons and test the applicability of models that have been proposed for the negative feedback control of plasmid copy number by iterons. In the initiator titration model, the concentration of plasmid-encoded initiator protein that binds the iterons is assumed to be limiting (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Chattoraj D. Cordes K. Abeles A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6456-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Pal S.K. Mason R.J. Chattoraj D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Tsutsui H. Fujiyama A. Murotsu T. Matsubara K. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 337-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lin L.S. Meyer R.J. Plasmid. 1986; 15: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). With increase of copy number, the limiting amount of initiator is believed to distribute to different origins, preventing saturation of any one origin. Thus, the increase of origin (or, more precisely, iteron) concentration relative to initiator provides the negative feedback signal. The model was questioned when extra initiators did not increase copy number significantly in many iteron-carrying plasmids: R6K (30Filutowicz M. McEachern M.J. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9645-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), P1 (21Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RK2 (31Durland R.H. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3849-3858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pSC101 (32Ingmer H. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7834-7841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Rts1 (33Terawaki Y. Nozue H. Zeng H. Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Itoh Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 786-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although not R1162 (34Kim K. Meyer R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).A second model, the handcuffing model, is based on the finding that the initiators can pair iterons in trans (21Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35McEachern M.J. Bott M.A. Tooker P.A. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7942-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the pairing causes a steric hindrance to origin activity, increases with increased origin (iteron) concentration and cannot be relieved by increasing the concentration of RepA. As discussed above, this model was invoked when the titration model was found inadequate to explain insensitivity of copy number to increases of initiator concentration.A third mode of control is conspicuous in some members of iteron-carrying plasmids: R6K (30Filutowicz M. McEachern M.J. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9645-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), P1 (21Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pSC101 (32Ingmer H. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7834-7841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Rts1 (33Terawaki Y. Nozue H. Zeng H. Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Itoh Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 786-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these plasmids, a modest increase of initiator concentration was shown to lead to a decrease in copy number. The mechanism of this mode of control is not clear, but in principle such a mechanism can be an alternative to handcuffing in restraining copy number when RepA concentration becomes excessive.The results of the present paper are most easily explained by the initiator titration model. When the P1ori was cloned into the pUC19 vector with a copy number about 2.5-fold higher than that normally achieved by miniP1 plasmids (in the absence of theincA locus), the origins could still be opened but required higher concentrations of RepA (Fig. 4 B). Such a high concentration of P1ori also did not inhibit replication of an incoming λminiP1 plasmid prophage when extra RepA was provided (Table II). These results are consistent with the conclusion from a different set of experiments that origins are poor inhibitors of each other when RepA supply is adequate (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36Abeles A.L. Austin S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The inhibitory activity of iterons is clearly seen when they are not part of intact origins (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Chattoraj D. Cordes K. Abeles A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6456-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or when the origin is not functional as in high copy plasmid chimeras used here (Tables I and II). In some of these experiments, RepA was supplied from an autoregulatory source. One might expect that an autoregulatory source of RepA could promptly compensate for RepA titration. Were that true, the observed inhibition might be attributed to handcuffing. Experiments designed to determine the extent to which titration of RepA by iterons results in additional RepA synthesis showed that the induction of RepA was inefficient (20Chattoraj D.K. Mason R.J. Wickner S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 551-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This was also observed in the present studies (Tables I and II). The autoregulated source of RepA present in λminiP1 did not supply enough RepA to overcome inhibition by extra incC. The inhibition was overcome when extra RepA was provided from a constitutive promoter. One reason for inadequate RepA supply from the autoregulated source could be due to the capacity of iteron-bound RepA to repressprepA by RepA-mediated handcuffing (20Chattoraj D.K. Mason R.J. Wickner S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 551-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In experiments where the source of RepA was not autoregulatory and iteron-mediated inhibition prevails irrespective of the quantity of RepA supply, handcuffing remains the most satisfactory explanation (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,21Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Abeles A.L. Austin S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Even in experiments where the inhibition was overcome by oversupply of RepA (e.g. pBR322+incA, Fig. 4 A; pACYC184+incC, Table I; and pUC19+incC, Table II) and the results are adequately explained by titration, it is possible that handcuffing could have operated at steps after origin opening in experiments where replication was blocked (Fig. 4 A) or replication of vector could have interfered with handcuffing (Tables I and II). Similar ambiguity remains in some of our previous experiments where initiator titration appeared to be the simplest explanation. In one, incAinhibition of integrative suppression by λminiP1 was overcome by extra RepA (15Chattoraj D. Cordes K. Abeles A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6456-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the other, a block to lysogeny by λP1ori was overcome by extra RepA (21Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as in the present experiments (Tables I and II). In both of these experiments,incA was chromosomally located, and chromosomal replication could have interfered with handcuffing. Thus it is possible to accommodate most of our results as not contradicting the handcuffing model, if the conditions under which handcuffing operates are sufficiently constrained.How is the copy number of incA-deleted miniP1 plasmids controlled? If origins per se are not inhibitory to each other at high concentrations, the copy number could be limited by the availability of RepA or by some essential host factor(s) (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We already discussed that RepA supply from an autoregulated source could be limiting. Because RepA requires chaperones for activity (37Chattoraj D.K. Genet. Eng.17. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 81-98Google Scholar), their availability could be limiting. Another possibility could be that the supply of too much RepA limits copy number because of an accumulated inhibitor synthesized concomitantly with RepA.That the inhibitor is not RepA itself is suggested by two lines of evidence. Mutating the translation start codon of repAreduces RepA production drastically but not the synthesis of a replication inhibitor (9Muraiso K. Mukhopadhyay G. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also excess of purified RepA does not cause replication inhibition in vitro (36Abeles A.L. Austin S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 38Wickner S.H. Chattoraj D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When we exceeded the normal copy number of incA-deleted miniP1 in chimeric replicons, the normally inhibitory level of RepA synthesis was not inhibitory, most likely because the inhibitor distributed to different origins. Thus the relative rather than absolute levels of inhibitors and origins seem to be more important, and accumulating RepA at a rate higher than the increase of copy number can be a potential means to prevent runaway replication.In summary, it appears that in addition to relative concentrations of RepA and iterons, there are probably other players in copy number control. We are interested to know whether the inhibition of replication that is seen when RepA is artificially overproduced happens under normal circumstances. An understanding of the nature and mode of action of the inhibitor(s) may help also to determine the conditions that favor handcuffing and those that favor titration. Here we show that opening of the P1 plasmid origin in vivo can be detected efficiently by probing with KMnO4, provided the DnaB helicase loading to the origin is blocked. This has been achieved either by inactivating DnaC (2Gille H. Messer W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or by sequestering DnaB with λP protein (17Mallory J.B.

It is assumed that the pairing causes a steric hindrance to origin activity, increases with increased origin (iteron) concentration and cannot be relieved by increasing the concentration of RepA. As discussed above, this model was invoked when the titration model was found inadequate to explain insensitivity of copy number to increases of initiator concentration. A third mode of control is conspicuous in some members of iteron-carrying plasmids: R6K (30Filutowicz M. McEachern M.J. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9645-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), P1 (21Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pSC101 (32Ingmer H. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7834-7841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Rts1 (33Terawaki Y. Nozue H. Zeng H. Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Itoh Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 786-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these plasmids, a modest increase of initiator concentration was shown to lead to a decrease in copy number. The mechanism of this mode of control is not clear, but in principle such a mechanism can be an alternative to handcuffing in restraining copy number when RepA concentration becomes excessive. The results of the present paper are most easily explained by the initiator titration model. When the P1ori was cloned into the pUC19 vector with a copy number about 2.5-fold higher than that normally achieved by miniP1 plasmids (in the absence of theincA locus), the origins could still be opened but required higher concentrations of RepA (Fig. 4 B). Such a high concentration of P1ori also did not inhibit replication of an incoming λminiP1 plasmid prophage when extra RepA was provided (Table II). These results are consistent with the conclusion from a different set of experiments that origins are poor inhibitors of each other when RepA supply is adequate (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36Abeles A.L. Austin S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The inhibitory activity of iterons is clearly seen when they are not part of intact origins (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Chattoraj D. Cordes K. Abeles A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6456-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or when the origin is not functional as in high copy plasmid chimeras used here (Tables I and II). In some of these experiments, RepA was supplied from an autoregulatory source. One might expect that an autoregulatory source of RepA could promptly compensate for RepA titration. Were that true, the observed inhibition might be attributed to handcuffing. Experiments designed to determine the extent to which titration of RepA by iterons results in additional RepA synthesis showed that the induction of RepA was inefficient (20Chattoraj D.K. Mason R.J. Wickner S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 551-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This was also observed in the present studies (Tables I and II). The autoregulated source of RepA present in λminiP1 did not supply enough RepA to overcome inhibition by extra incC. The inhibition was overcome when extra RepA was provided from a constitutive promoter. One reason for inadequate RepA supply from the autoregulated source could be due to the capacity of iteron-bound RepA to repressprepA by RepA-mediated handcuffing (20Chattoraj D.K. Mason R.J. Wickner S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 551-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In experiments where the source of RepA was not autoregulatory and iteron-mediated inhibition prevails irrespective of the quantity of RepA supply, handcuffing remains the most satisfactory explanation (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,21Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Abeles A.L. Austin S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Even in experiments where the inhibition was overcome by oversupply of RepA (e.g. pBR322+incA, Fig. 4 A; pACYC184+incC, Table I; and pUC19+incC, Table II) and the results are adequately explained by titration, it is possible that handcuffing could have operated at steps after origin opening in experiments where replication was blocked (Fig. 4 A) or replication of vector could have interfered with handcuffing (Tables I and II). Similar ambiguity remains in some of our previous experiments where initiator titration appeared to be the simplest explanation. In one, incAinhibition of integrative suppression by λminiP1 was overcome by extra RepA (15Chattoraj D. Cordes K. Abeles A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6456-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the other, a block to lysogeny by λP1ori was overcome by extra RepA (21Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as in the present experiments (Tables I and II). In both of these experiments,incA was chromosomally located, and chromosomal replication could have interfered with handcuffing. Thus it is possible to accommodate most of our results as not contradicting the handcuffing model, if the conditions under which handcuffing operates are sufficiently constrained. How is the copy number of incA-deleted miniP1 plasmids controlled? If origins per se are not inhibitory to each other at high concentrations, the copy number could be limited by the availability of RepA or by some essential host factor(s) (8Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Youngren-Grimes B. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We already discussed that RepA supply from an autoregulated source could be limiting. Because RepA requires chaperones for activity (37Chattoraj D.K. Genet. Eng.17. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 81-98Google Scholar), their availability could be limiting. Another possibility could be that the supply of too much RepA limits copy number because of an accumulated inhibitor synthesized concomitantly with RepA. That the inhibitor is not RepA itself is suggested by two lines of evidence. Mutating the translation start codon of repAreduces RepA production drastically but not the synthesis of a replication inhibitor (9Muraiso K. Mukhopadhyay G. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also excess of purified RepA does not cause replication inhibition in vitro (36Abeles A.L. Austin S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 38Wickner S.H. Chattoraj D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When we exceeded the normal copy number of incA-deleted miniP1 in chimeric replicons, the normally inhibitory level of RepA synthesis was not inhibitory, most likely because the inhibitor distributed to different origins. Thus the relative rather than absolute levels of inhibitors and origins seem to be more important, and accumulating RepA at a rate higher than the increase of copy number can be a potential means to prevent runaway replication. In summary, it appears that in addition to relative concentrations of RepA and iterons, there are probably other players in copy number control. We are interested to know whether the inhibition of replication that is seen when RepA is artificially overproduced happens under normal circumstances. An understanding of the nature and mode of action of the inhibitor(s) may help also to determine the conditions that favor handcuffing and those that favor titration.

Integrins (IN)1 are a family of structurally and functionally related adhesion receptors that participate in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar,2Glukova M.A. Thiéry J.-P. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 241-249PubMed Google Scholar). All integrins are heterodimers of non-covalently associated α and β subunits. In general, ligand binding occurs through recognition by the integrin of a short amino acid sequence from the ligand (3Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). The prototype for these integrin-binding sites is the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence (4Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti M.D. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar) that is present in fibronectin, fibrinogen, vitronectin, and other adhesive proteins (5Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. Mecham R.P. Integrins: Molecular and Biological Responses to Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 1-32Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Divalent cations are essential for integrin function (6Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12927-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both integrin α and β subunits have been implicated in cation and ligand binding (7Tuckwell D.S. Humphries M.J. Eble J.A. Kühn K. Integrin-Ligand Interactions. Chapman & Hall, New York1997: 199-217Google Scholar), although the precise nature of the ligand recognition site on integrins remains elusive. The β subunits are characterized by a conserved domain in their N-terminal regions that contributes to cation as well as ligand binding (8Goodman T.G. Bajt M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23729-23736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Puzon-Mc Laughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14236-14243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The integrin α subunits are characterized by the presence of seven N-terminal repeats that encompass nearly half of the subunit residues (5Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. Mecham R.P. Integrins: Molecular and Biological Responses to Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 1-32Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Three to four of these repeats (IV or V to VII) display sequences that resemble the EF-hand consensus sequence found in various divalent cation-binding proteins (11Tuckwell D.S. Brass A. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the integrin EF-hands systematically lack an acidic residue at their relative positions 12, a highly invariant Glu residue in the typical EF-hands, that is replaced by a non-polar residue. It has been hypothesized that the integrin EF-hands are responsible for the cation binding properties of the integrin α subunits (11Tuckwell D.S. Brass A. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis, a soluble recombinant fragment that encompasses the four EF-hand type sequences from the α subunit of integrin αIIbβ3 displays four Ca2+-binding sites distributed in two classes differing by their affinities (12Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L. Concord E. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this isolated, fully Ca2+-loaded, αIIb EF-hand domain binds fibrinogen in an RGD-dependent manner, establishing the functional importance of an α-integrin EF-hand type domain in ligand-integrin interactions. Knowledge of the tertiary organization of these macromolecular components, in their free states and in the integrin-ligand complexes, is of paramount importance to our understanding of the molecular bases of cell adhesion. It is now established that the RGD adhesion motif occurs in extended flexible loops between β-strands, based on atomic resolution structures of ligand proteins (13Leahy D. Hendrikson W. Aukhil I. Erickson H. Science. 1992; 258: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 14Main A. Harvey T. Baron M. Boyd J. Campbell I.

Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Additional sequences besides the RGD motif are required for full adhesion activity with some of the ligand proteins. A region in the fibronectin 9th type III repeat (or III9) that contains the PHSRN sequence appears to synergize with RGD in the 10th type III repeat (or III10) for recognition by α5β1 (18Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of a recombinant protein spanning type III repeats 7–10 of fibronectin has revealed (17Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) that both sites, RGD and PHSRN, are located on the same face of the ligand molecule in agreement with the synergistic properties of the latter. By contrast, no tertiary structure information is available so far for the integrins, with the exception of the I domains in αM, αL, and α2 (19Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 20Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Hypothetical models based on molecular modeling have been proposed to account for the folding of the N-terminal regions of the integrin α subunits, including the cation-binding EF-hand type repeats. A first model predicted a 4-fold helix-loop-helix (HLH) arrangement, as in CaM, for the cation-binding domain in the αL subunit (22Stanley P. Bates P.A. Harvey J. Bennett R.I. Hogg N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1790-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Another model envisages a β-propeller fold that encompasses all N-terminal repeats I–VII (23Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This fold consists of seven modules, with 4-stranded β-sheets each, in a toroidal arrangement. Both models, the CaM model and the β-propeller, appear mutually incompatible with regard to the structure of the EF-hand domain. The first one predicts a large contribution of α-helices, whereas the second one is only β-strand and coil. We report here on the cloning, expression, and purification of three protein fragments representing different sequences from the cation-binding domain of the α subunit in human integrin α5β1. Two different types of proteins were produced as follows: (i) α5-(229–448) representing the entire cation-binding domain, with four EF-hand loop sequences; (ii) α5-(229–316) and α5-(350–448) representing the N- and C-terminal half-domains, respectively, with two EF-hand loop sequences each. The search for a minimal ligand-competent region from the α5 cation-binding domain was guided by the results of Gulino et al. (12Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L. Concord E. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with αIIb, as well as by the CaM model (22Stanley P. Bates P.A. Harvey J. Bennett R.I. Hogg N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1790-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The production of such recombinant α5 proteins in soluble form opens for the first time the possibility of investigating the structural organization of the α5 divalent cation-binding domain as a prototype of the homologous EF-hand domains in the different integrin α subunits. By using CD spectroscopy, we established that these α5proteins display a well defined structural organization in solution. We then investigated their capacity to bind divalent cations, as well as their conformational variability upon cation binding, and their capacity to bind RGD-containing fibronectin (FN) ligands. The buffers used throughout this work are detailed as follows: buffer A, 12.5 mm sodium borate, 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, pH 8.3; buffer B, buffer A containing 5 mm MgCl2, 2 μg/ml aprotinin (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol. The DNA sequences coding for the integrin amino acid sequences (i) 229–448, (ii) 229–316, and (iii) 350–448 of human α5 were produced by polymerase chain reaction technology. The DNA template corresponded to the full-length α5cDNA (24Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were synthesized and used as primers, i.e. α5-(229–448), 5′-GCA CGT CAT ATG AGC TAC CTA GGA TAC-3′ and 5′-CG GGA TCC CTA GCC CCT GTA TAC CAC-3′; α5-(229–316), 5′-TT CGA ATT CAT ATG AGC TAC CTA GGA TAC-3′ and 5′-TCC GGA TCC TCA CCC GTC AGG GGT CCG-3′; α5-(350–448), 5′-TT CGA ATT CAT ATG CGA TTT GGC AGC TCC-3′and 5′-TCC GGA TCC CTA GCC CCT GTA TAC CAC-3′. These primers were designed to generate an NdeI restriction site at the 5′ end and an in-frame stop codon as well as a BamHI restriction site at the 3′ end. Amplification was performed in a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler using Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and proceeded through a cycle of denaturation at 94 °C (1 min), annealing at 55 °C (1 min), and extension at 72 °C (2 min) for a total of 30 cycles. The polymerase chain reaction fragments were purified using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), digested with NdeI and BamHI, and inserted into the pET15b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). This vector allows expression of the corresponding sequence fused with a His tag N-terminal segment that includes the hexahistidinyl segment and the thrombin cleavage site. The clones obtained were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5457-5463Crossref Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) using the Sequenase system (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Cultures of Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) host strain transformed with the pET15b-α5-(229–448), pET15b-α5-(229–316), or pET15b-α5-(350–448) expression vectors were grown overnight at 30 °C in Terrific Broth (TB) medium, diluted 1 in 100 into fresh TB, and incubated with shaking at 30 °C up to an absorbance of 0.8 at 600 nm. Induction of protein expression was achieved by addition of IPTG to a final 1 mm concentration and further incubation for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm KCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mm PMSF at pH 8 and lysed by sonication. Following sonication, the suspension was centrifuged (27,000 ×g for 30 min). The recombinant proteins were located in both the soluble and insoluble fractions of bacterial lysate (see “Results”). DNA was precipitated with protamine sulfate (26van der Westhuizen D.R. von Holt C. FEBS Lett. 1971; 14: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The protein fraction obtained was dialyzed against buffer A plus 5 mm MgCl2 and loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen) previously equilibrated in the same buffer. His tag-α5-(229–448) was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient (0–200 mm). The recombinant protein was eluted at about 150 mm imidazole. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against buffer A plus 5 mm MgCl2 and loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacryl column (IBF, France) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. Elution was carried out with a linear KCl gradient (0.15–1.5 m; protein eluted at about 1.2 mKCl). Desalting was carried out on a Sephadex G-50 column (Pharmacia, Sweden) equilibrated in buffer A plus 5 mmMgCl2. The pellet obtained after bacterial lysis was washed with buffer B plus 1 murea (see “Results”) and resuspended in buffer B plus 6m urea. The suspension was loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose column previously equilibrated in buffer B plus 6 m urea. After washing with the same buffer, the protein was eluted using a linear imidazole gradient (0–200 mm) in buffer B plus 6m urea. The denatured protein was dialyzed against buffer B plus 6 m urea to remove all imidazole in excess and was progressively added to a slurry of Ni-NTA agarose, previously equilibrated in buffer B plus 6 m urea, to achieve a protein-to-resin ratio of about 0.5 mg of protein/ml of packed wet resin. The suspension was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C under gentle rocking. The resin was then loaded onto a column and washed with buffer B plus 6 m urea. Refolding was carried out using a linear urea gradient (6 to 0 m in buffer B). The refolded protein was then eluted from the column with buffer B plus 0.2 m imidazole and centrifuged (150,000 ×g for 1 h) to discard insoluble protein. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined from its UV absorbance at 276 nm (see below). The recovery yield corresponds to the ratio of the amount of solubilized protein to the amount of protein initially bound to the Ni-NTA agarose matrix. The His-tagged proteins were first dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8 containing 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1m urea (see “Results”). Digestion was carried out at 37 °C at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 10 units of thrombin (Sigma) per mg of cleavable protein. The reaction was stopped by the addition of PMSF to a final concentration of 2 mm. The time needed for an efficient cleavage reaction was previously determined by a time course SDS-PAGE analysis. The digestion mixture was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 400 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol (v/v) at pH 8 and loaded onto a Ni-NTA column. The unbound protein was dialyzed against buffer A plus 5 mm MgCl2 and loaded onto a DEAE-Trisacryl column. Elution was carried out with a linear KCl gradient (0.15–1.5 m KCl). The proteins obtained include the tetrapeptide GSHM resulting from the cleavage by thrombin (see “Results”). UV absorbance measurements at 276 nm (Cary 118 UV spectrometer) were used to determine protein concentrations. The molar absorbances of the different recombinant proteins used throughout this work were determined by the procedure of Gill and von Hippel (27Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). The contribution of scattering to the UV spectra was usually avoided by ultracentrifugation (150,000 ×g for 1 h). The values obtained (expressed in liters·m−1·cm−1) are 24,390 for α5-(229–448), 18,640 for α5-(229–448)W406L, 10,150 for α5-(229–316), 10,530 for α5-(350–448), 32,150 for FNIII8–10, and 19,500 for FNIII10–11. In the absence of any additional aromatic residue in the 20-residue N-terminal His tag appendix absorbing at 276 nm, identical values were adopted for the His-tagged proteins. CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a dichrograph CD6 (Jobin Yvon, Paris, France) under a stream of pure nitrogen. The spectra are the average of five scans recorded using a bandwidth of 2 nm, a step width of 0.1 nm, and a 0.5-s averaging time per point. Cell path lengths were 1.00 ± 0.01 mm (far UV region, <250 nm) or 50.00 ± 0.01 mm (near UV region, >250 nm). Protein concentrations in the 10 μm range were used. The protein concentration was similar for both the far and the near UV measurements to avoid concentration-dependent effects. Absolute ellipticity values were inferred from standardization with d-10-camphosulfonic acid (Fluka, Switzerland) according to the procedure of Venyaminov and Yang (28Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Fasman G. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 69-108Crossref Google Scholar). Molar ellipticities are given in degrees·cm2 per dmol of mean amino acid residue, with M r = 115 (28Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Fasman G. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 69-108Crossref Google Scholar). Deconvolution of the far UV CD profiles was carried out using standard computer procedures including ridge regression (29Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar), variable selection procedure (30Manalvan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal.

The dispersion in the values given in Table I corresponds to the extrema obtained with these different methods.Table ISecondary structure content in percentage (%) and in number of residues (res) as determined from the far UV region of the CD spectra of the recombinant fragments from the α subunit of human integrin α5β1 (see Figs. 2 and 4)Proteinα-Helixβ-Strandα-Helix (res)β-Strand (res)%%α5-(229–448)30–3520–2566–7744–55α5-(229–316)30–3525–3026–3022–26α5-(350–448)25–3020–2525–3020–25 Open table in a new tab The purified recombinant proteins were desalted by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Nucleosil C4 column (SFCC, France) using a linear acetonitrile gradient (35–65%) in deionized water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The pooled protein fractions were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry using a Fisons VG Trio 2000 mass spectrometer equipped with an ion spray source. The protein molecular masses were determined using the ESI deconvolution software from Fisons. N-terminal amino sequencing was carried out by automated step-by-step Edman degradation using a gas phase amino acid sequencer with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc., model 476A), as described by Speicher (32Speicher D.W. Hugli T.E. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. 1. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 24-25Crossref Google Scholar). Ten steps were performed. Ca2+blotting experiments were carried by using either radioactive45Ca2+ (33Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) or the fluorescent quinoline Ca2+ indicator quin2 (34Tatsumi R. Shimada K. Hattori A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the amount of Ca2+ ions bound to the α5 recombinant fragments was carried out by densitometry (NIH Image software) of the electrophoretic band labeled with either 45Ca2+or quin2. Parvalbumin with a known stoichiometry of 2 Ca2+/protein (35Benzonana G. Capony J.-P. Pechère J.-F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 270: 110-116Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was used as a standard to obtain a plot representing the intensity of the labeled electrophoretic band as a function of Ca2+ content. The linear plots obtained (not shown) were used to infer the binding stoichiometry of the α5 recombinant fragments. CD-monitored titrations with Ca2+ or Mg2+ were carried out using the apoforms of our different integrin recombinant fragments that were obtained as described previously for parvalbumin (36Blancuzzi Y. Padilla A. Parello J. Cavé A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Titrations were carried out by adding aliquots of either CaCl2 or MgCl2 in buffer A at concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 mm to an apoprotein solution at 10 μmconcentration to afford regularly spaced points in the titration plot (see “Results”). Under the conditions used, the protein concentration was kept nearly constant over the entire range of cation concentrations used (the maximum dilution effect did not exceed 2% of the initial protein concentration). A protein affinity chromatography method similar to that described by Roberts and Green (37Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) was used to evaluate the binding of the α5recombinant fragments to the immobilized fibronectin ligand. The α5 recombinant fragments were incubated with the GST fusion fibronectin fragment, GST-FNIII8–10, from human origin (38Lombardo A. Wang Y. Ni C.-Z. Dai X. Dickinson C.D. Kondapani R. Chiang S. White C.A. Pio F. Xuong N.-H. Hamlin R.C. Ruoslahti E. Ely K.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1934-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) in buffer A at different CaCl2 or MgCl2 concentrations. The protein mixture was then loaded on a glutathione-agarose matrix (Sigma). Washing of the column was carried out with the incubation buffer until all unbound material was eluted. The proteins bound to the matrix were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis. We verified that GST itself did not interfere with the integrin-ligand association (not shown). Before complex formation, the IN and FN components were dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2 at pH 6.0. After centrifugation (80,000 × g for 30 min), the recombinant integrin and fibronectin molecules were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio (in the 10 μm range), incubated at room temperature for 2 h, and then subjected to chemical cross-linking by the addition of dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) in N, N-dimethylformamide to a final concentration of 0.5 mm (39Thomas J.O. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 270: 549-571Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 50 mm. The time necessary for a complete cross-linking reaction was previously determined by a time course SDS-PAGE analysis (not shown). The cross-linked molecular species were separated by size-exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S-100 HR column (2.6 × 100 cm; Pharmacia, Sweden) under non-denaturing conditions (40Loster K. Baum O. Hofman W. Reutter W. J. Chromatogr. 1995; 711: 187-199Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Two different clones were obtained as revealed by nucleotide sequencing. One clone codes for the parent amino acid sequence α5-(229–448) and the other for α5-(229–448)W406L, a single point mutant with the unique Trp-406 (see Fig. 9 B) substituted by Leu. Since similar results were obtained for the expression, purification, and refolding of the wild-type protein and the W406L mutant, no further distinction will be made between the two proteins throughout this paper unless otherwise directly stated. The pET15b-α5-(229–448) vector was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and protein expression was induced by the addition of IPTG (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). Independently of temperature and IPTG concentration, only a minor part of the recombinant protein was found in the soluble fraction of bacterial lysate, whereas the major part remained in the insoluble fraction. The protein was purified from the soluble fraction by affinity chromatography using a Ni-NTA agarose column followed by two additional chromatographic steps (see “Experimental Procedures”) to yield the purified His-tagged protein that was subsequently cleaved with thrombin (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Cleavage yields by thrombin were optimized using variable urea concentrations in the 0.5–2 m range (see “Experimental Procedures”). Approximately 2 mg of protein/1.5 liters of bacterial culture were obtained from the soluble fraction after purification and thrombin cleavage. As shown in Fig. 1 A (lane 5), α5-(229–448) binds Ca2+ as assessed by 45Ca2+ overlay blotting experiments. The stoichiometry of the binding was determined from the intensity of the 45Ca2+-labeled band using parvalbumin as a standard (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two independent measurements gave 3.9 and 4.1 Ca2+ ions per molecule of α5-(229–448). Similarly, the fluorescence quin2 procedure adapted for quantitative measurements (see “Experimental Procedures”) afforded 3.91 and 3.88 Ca2+ions per α5-(229–448) molecule. This leads to the conclusion that the isolated α5 EF-hand domain displays a total binding stoichiometry of four Ca2+ per protein molecule.Figure 1Expression and purification of recombinant α5-(229–448).

The influence of salt and protein concentration on the recovery of His tag-α5-(229–448) as a soluble protein is illustrated in B and C. The Ni-NTA immobilized protein in its denatured form was refolded as described under “Experimental Procedures”: B, at constant protein concentration of 1 mg/ml hydrated resin in buffer A at different KCl concentrations;C, at different protein concentrations (in mg of protein/ml of hydrated resin) at 150 mm KCl in buffer B. The recovery yield was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After a first washing of the pellet in 1 m urea which significantly reduced the amount of contaminant bacterial proteins (SDS-PAGE, not shown), the recombinant protein from the insoluble fraction was solubilized in 6 m urea. Based on previous refolding assays using matrix-bound proteins (41Sinha D. Bakhshi M. Vora R. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 509-514PubMed Google Scholar, 42Stempfer G. Höll-Neugebauer B. Rudolph R. Nat.

The efficiency of protein refolding was dependent on different parameters that were optimized as follows: (i) the recovery yield is strongly dependent on KCl concentration, as shown in Fig. 1 B; a maximum yield (∼65%) was observed at about 150 mm KCl, whereas at"

An M13mp2 lacZα DNA-based reversion assay was developed to assess the error frequency of DNA repair synthesis at a site-specific uracil residue. All three possible base substitution errors were detected at the uracil target causing reversion of opal codon 14 in the Escherichia coli lacZα gene. Using human glioblastoma U251 whole cell extracts, approximately 50% of the heteroduplex uracil-containing DNA substrate was completely repaired, as determined by the insensitivity of form I DNA reaction products to cleavage by a combined treatment of E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase and endonuclease IV. The majority of repair occurred by the uracil-initiated base excision repair pathway, since the addition of the bacteriophage PBS2 uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein to extracts significantly blocked this process. In addition, the formation of repaired form I DNA molecules occurred concurrently with limited DNA synthesis, which was largely restricted to the HinfI DNA fragment initially containing the uracil residue and specific to the uracil-containing DNA strand. Based on the reversion frequency of repaired M13mp2 DNA, the fidelity of DNA repair synthesis at the target was determined to be about one misincorporated nucleotide per 1900 repaired uracil residues. The major class of base substitutions propagated transversion mutations, which were distributed almost equally between T to G and T to A changes in the template. A similar mutation frequency was also observed using whole cell extracts from human colon adenocarcinoma LoVo cells, suggesting that mismatch repair did not interfere with the fidelity measurements.

Uracil-initiated base excision repair (BER)1 maintains the genetic integrity of the human genome by removing uracil residues that accumulate in cellular DNA following the spontaneous deamination of cytosine in DNA or incorporation of dUMP during DNA synthesis (1Mosbaugh D.W.

Unrepaired uracil residues in DNA contribute to cytotoxic, mutagenic, and lethal events in the cell (1Mosbaugh D.W. Bennett S.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The basic steps of uracil-initiated BER are conserved between bacterial and human cells, which underscores the biological significance of this repair pathway (for reviews, see Refs. 1Mosbaugh D.W.

Repair is initiated by hydrolytic cleavage of the N-glycosyl bond linking the uracil base to the deoxyribose phosphate DNA backbone by uracil-DNA glycosylase, releasing free uracil and producing an apyrimidinic site (5Lindahl T.

Five distinct forms of uracil-DNA glycosylase have been previously reported in human cells; however, their relative contribution to BER remains to be determined in vivo. A mitochondrial (UNG1) and nuclear (UNG2) enzyme derived from the same UNG gene (also designated UDG1) by alternative mRNA splicing have been extensively studied (19Nilsen H. Otterlei M. Haug T. Solum K. Nagelhus T.A. Skorpen F. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 20Slupphaug G. Markussen F.H. Olsen L.C. Aasland R. Aarsaether N.

These two subcellular forms apparently have identical catalytic domains but different N-terminal sequences (19Nilsen H. Otterlei M. Haug T. Solum K. Nagelhus T.A. Skorpen F. Krokan H.E.

A cyclin-like uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG2) was identified that shares significant amino acid similarity with the cyclin A protein family but not with the UNG gene products (21Muller S.J. Caradonna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1310-1319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase has been purported to exhibit uracil-DNA glycosylase activity but only after subunit dissociation from the natural tetrameric to monomeric form (22Meyer-Siegler K. Mauro D.J. Seal G. Wurzer J. de Riel J.K. Sirover M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Finally, thymine-DNA glycosylase, which was originally identified as a G·T mismatch repair enzyme, has recently been shown to specifically excise uracil from duplex DNA containing G·U mispairs but not A·U base pairs (23Neddermann P. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The thymine-DNA glycosylase amino acid sequence does not appear to be related to the other four proteins (25Barrett T. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The heretofore mentioned uracil-DNA glycosylases can be classified into two categories based on their inhibition by the bacteriophage PBS1 or -2 uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein (Ugi). Ugi forms a stable 1:1 complex with uracil-DNA glycosylase that is essentially irreversible under physiological conditions (26Bennett S.E. Schimerlik M.I. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol.

Res. 1996; 222: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) are each inhibited by Ugi. In contrast, human erythrocyte glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase has not been found to bind Ugi, 2R. J. Sanderson and D. W. Mosbaugh, unpublished data.2R. J. Sanderson and D. W. Mosbaugh, unpublished data. and neither HeLa nor human recombinant thymine-DNA glycosylase have been shown to be inhibited by Ugi (23Neddermann P. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent studies suggest that following the removal of the uracil base and cleavage at the resultant AP site, two alternative pathways may be utilized for completing uracil-initiated BER in eukaryotic cells (17Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 4: 1069-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These pathways are distinguished by the size of the repair patch created during the DNA synthesis step. Short-patch BER results in a one-nucleotide incorporation event during DNA repair synthesis, whereas long patch BER involves repair synthesis of 2–7 nucleotides (15Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol.

Unlike short patch repair, long patch BER most likely depends on strand displacement and/or exonuclease activity to carry out additional DNA synthesis. While both pathways may operate in vivo, the primary pathway used by human cell extracts to remove uracil from DNA is reportedly the short patch BER mechanism (32Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar,33Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Several observations have implicated DNA polymerase β (pol β) as the predominant polymerase involved in uracil-initiated BER synthesis in eukaryotic cells. First, the biochemical properties of pol β are consistent with a gap-filling role during both short and long patch BER synthesis. The preferred DNA substrate of pol β is a 5′-phosphorylated one-nucleotide gap, which is formed as an intermediate in short-patch BER, although small gaps (2–6 nucleotides) may also be filled to completion (12Mosbaugh D.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Second, the addition of purified pol β to human nuclear extracts increased uracil-initiated BER by as much as 10-fold, whereas DNA polymerase α, δ, and ε had no significant effect (18Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Third, the observation that both human and Xenopus laevis DNA pol β possess an intrinsic deoxyribophosphodiesterase activity provides evidence that pol β directly participates in two consecutive steps of the BER pathway (9Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 10Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 11Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Fourth, a recent study demonstrates that pol β is coordinately assembled onto AP site-containing DNA by human AP endonuclease bound to an uncleaved AP site (36Bennett R.A.O. Wilson III, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Fifth, evidence that pol β participates in a concordant BER pathway was suggested by the isolation of a bovine multiprotein complex containing UDG, AP endonuclease, pol β, and DNA ligase I, which was capable of conducting short patch BER in vitro (37Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Sixth, reconstitution experiments using purified human proteins revealed that a complex between pol β, DNA ligase III, and XRCC1 may alternatively act to promote uracil-initiated short patch BER, since XRCC1 suppresses the limited DNA strand displacement activity of pol β (38Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schär P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Recently, a long patch BER system was reconstituted using purified human AP endonuclease, Pol β, DNase IV, and DNA ligase I or III with a reduced AP site containing DNA substrate (32Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In this case, the 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity associated with DNase IV was stimulated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen and facilitated larger gap formation (32Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In vitro, long patch BER was reconstituted with either DNA polymerase β or δ; however, the addition of neutralizing polyclonal pol β-specific antibodies to human cell-free extracts caused a 20-fold reduction in the extent of long patch BER (32Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Similar investigations using antibodies raised against either pol β or an amino-terminal fragment (8-kDa domain) of pol β appeared to completely inhibit uracil-initiated BER in bovine testis nuclear extracts (18Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations provide strong evidence that pol β plays a major role in uracil-initiated BER. Although the molecular mechanism of human uracil-initiated BER is understood in some detail, the fidelity and error specificity of repair DNA synthesis during this process has not been adequately investigated. We have therefore developed an M13mp2 lacZα DNA-based reversion assay for detecting base substitution errors produced during BER in human whole cell extracts. The fidelity of BER synthesis at a defined uracil residue located in the E. coli lacZα gene of heteroduplex M13mp2 DNA was measured, and the mutation spectrum was elucidated. Oligonucleotides GGGTAACGCCCGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGTCATTGTAAAACG (A-41-mer) and GCACTCCAGCCAGCTTTCCGG (sequencing primer) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer by the Center for Gene Research and Biotechnology (Oregon State University). Two complementary oligonucleotides, AGCTTGGCTGCAGGTUGACGGATCCCCGGGAATT (U-34-mer) and AATTCCCGGGGATCCGTCAACCTGCAGCCAAGCT (A-34-mer), were synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Company. Oligonucleotides CCCAGTCACGTCUTTGTAAAACG (U-23-mer) and CCCAGTCACGTCATTGTAAAACG (A-23-mer) were synthesized and gel purified by Oligos Etc. Deblocked, deprotected, and 5′-end-phosphorylated oligonucleotides were prepared as described previously (39Bennett S.E. Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W.

Radany (University of Michigan), and the human colon adenocarcinoma LoVo cell line was procured from the American Type Culture Collection. E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase (fraction V) and Ugi (fraction IV) were purified as described by Sanderson and Mosbaugh (41Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29170-29181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). E. coli endonuclease IV (fraction V) was provided by B. Demple (Harvard University). T4 DNA polymerase was obtained from New England Biolabs or purified by the procedure of Rush and Konigsberg (42Rush J. Konigsberg W.H. Prep. Biochem. 1989; 19: 329-340PubMed Google Scholar) except that a single-stranded DNA-agarose column was used in place of the DNA-cellulose column and the 32P-Affi-Gel 10 column was omitted. T4 polynucleotide kinase; restriction endonucleasesEcoRI, SmaI, and HinfI; and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. M13mp2 DNA was isolated from E. coli CJ236 cells and purified as described by Kunkel (43Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutations in thelacZα gene were introduced by annealing 5′-end-phosphorylated oligonucleotide A-41-mer to M13mp2 DNA and conducting a primer extension reaction (43Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide A-41-mer shared sequence complementarity with lacZα from position 68 to 108 except for discrepancies at positions 78–80 and 98. These two sites introduced an opal codon (TGA) in place of an arginine codon (CGT) coding for amino acid residue 14 of the lacZα gene product and a silent mutation generating a unique SmaI restriction site, respectively. Primer extension reaction mixtures (300 μl) contained 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4); 2 mmdithiothreitol; 13 mm MgC12; 1 mmATP; a 500 μm concentration each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP; 50 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin; 27 units of T4 DNA polymerase; 1200 units of T4 DNA ligase; and 8.8 pmol of heteroduplex A-41-mer/M13mp2 DNA. After incubation for 5 min on ice, 5 min at 25 °C, and 4 h at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated with the addition of 53 μl of 0.1 m EDTA. Competent E. coli JM109 cells (∼1.4 × 1011 cells/ml) in 10% (w/v) glycerol (40 μl) were mixed with the primer-extended DNA (0.5 μl), and electroporation was carried out using a Gene Pulser system (Bio-Rad) with a single pulse at 2.5 kV, 25-microfarad capacitance, and 200 ohms. Transfected cells were diluted into SOC media (2% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.05% NaC1, 2.5 mm KC1, 10 mm MgC12, 20 mm glucose) and grown on M9 plates containing 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. An isolated clear plaque was selected and plaque-purified. Phage were propagated in E. coli JM109 cells and M13mp2op14 DNA was purified (43Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis was conducted using an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer by the Center for Gene Research and Biotechnology (Oregon State University) and verified that M13mp2op14 DNA contained the desired lacZα opal codon and a uniqueSmaI restriction site. M13mp2op14 DNA was annealed to 5′-end phosphorylated oligonucleotides U-23-mer or A-23-mer, and primer extension reactions were performed similarly to that described above (40Longley M.J. Mosbaugh D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 43Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

Covalently closed circular duplex DNA reaction products were isolated by ethidium bromide-cesium chloride gradient centrifugation as described by Sambrook et al. (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Centrifugation was performed in a SW41 rotor (Beckman) at 39,000 rpm for 60 h at 20 °C. Form I DNA was isolated, extracted four times with an equal volume of 1-butanol saturated with 5 m NaC1, concentrated using a Centricon-30 (Amicon) concentrator, and buffer-exchanged into TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HC1 (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA). Human glioblastoma U251 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mg/ml NaHCO3, 0.3 mg/ml l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Human colon adenocarcinoma LoVo cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 1.2 mg/ml NaHCO3. All cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 90% humidity. Cells were grown to ∼85% confluency in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks and were harvested by scraping into 8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 2.7 mm KC1, 137 mm NaC1 (pH 7.2)). Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously by Wood et al. (45Wood R.D. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Methods (San Diego). 1995; 7: 163-175Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Standard BER reaction mixtures contained 100 mm Tris-HC1 (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgC12, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm β-NAD, 20 μm each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 5 mm phosphocreatine di-Tris salt, 200 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase, 10 μg/ml M13mp2op14 (U·T) heteroduplex DNA (form I) or M13mp2op14 (A·T) homoduplex DNA (form I), and 2 mg/ml whole cell extract protein. In some cases, 200 μCi/ml of [α-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was also included in the reaction. Incubation occurred at 30 °C for various amounts of time. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2000 units of Ugi and adjustment to 20 mm EDTA. RNase A was then added to 80 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Following the addition of SDS to 0.5%, proteinase K was added to 190 μg/ml, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), ethanol-precipitated, washed with 75% ethanol, and resuspended in 30 μl of TE buffer. Samples of repaired M13mp2op14 (U·T) DNA, isolated as described above, were treated with 400 units of Ung per μg of DNA for 30 min at 37 °C. After terminating the reaction with a 10-fold unit excess of Ugi, 4 units of E. coli endonuclease IV (Endo IV) were added per μg of DNA, and incubation continued at 37 °C for 30 min. This reaction was then terminated by heating at 70 °C for 3 min. Form I DNA that was insensitive to the Ung/Endo IV cleavage was isolated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. Briefly, DNA samples were combined with agarose dye buffer to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS, 10 mmEDTA, 5% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue. After loading each sample (10 μl) onto an agarose gel (12 × 13 cm) containing TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) and 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, electrophoresis was performed at 100 V until the tracking dye migrated ∼75% of the distance through the gel. Form I DNA was recovered from gel slices by electroelution into TAE buffer using an Elutrap (Schleicher and Schuell) apparatus, concentrated using a Centricon 30 (Amicon) concentrator, and buffer-exchanged with distilled water. E. coli MC1061 or NR9162 cells were transfected with purified form I DNA as described previously by Robertset al. (46Roberts J.D. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, form I DNA samples (0.5–2.5 μl) were added to competent E. coli cells (50 μl), and transfection was conducted using a Gene Pulser electroporation system with a single pulse at 2.0 kV, 25-microfarad capacitance, and 400 ohms. Transfected cells were diluted into SOC media, mixed with midlogE. coli CSH50 cells, plated on M9 plates containing 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown overnight at 37 °C. After scoring the plaques as either colorless or blue, the reversion frequency was calculated from the ratio of the number of blue plaques to total (colorless plus blue) plaques detected. Blue plaques were picked and placed into 200 μl of sterile 0.9% NaC1 solution, and extracted phage were diluted into SM media and titered against midlog E. coli CSH50 cells on M9 plates containing isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. An individual blue plaque from each secondary screening was used to isolate phage DNA for nucleotide sequence analysis. Standard BER reactions were performed except that 200 μCi/ml [α-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was included in the reaction mixture. DNA reaction products were isolated and treated in the presence or absence of Ung/Endo IV, and form I and II DNA were resolved by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis as described above. Ethidium bromide-stained DNA bands were visualized by transillumination (302 nm), and the percentage of form I and II DNA was quantitated against form I and II DNA standards from the same gel using a gel documentation system (model GDS7500; Ultra-Violet Products Ltd.) and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The amount of form I and II DNA recovered after incubation with whole cell extract protein decreased in a time-dependent manner"
https://openalex.org/W1985687898,"Sialidases (EC 3.2.1.18) are commonly found in viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and vertebrates, but not in invertebrates. We have previously reported the presence of a new sialidase activity in the gut of exclusively hematophagous insects of the <i>Triatoma</i> genus, which transmit Chagas' disease (Amino, R., Acosta, A., Morita, O. M., Chioccola, V. L. P., and Schenkman, S. (1995) <i>Glycobiology</i> 5, 625–631). Here we show that this sialidase is present in the salivary gland of <i>Triatoma infestans</i>, and it is released with the saliva during the insect bite. The sialidase was purified to homogeneity (>5000 times) to a specific activity of more than 20 units/mg. It elutes from a gel filtration column with a volume corresponding to the size of 33 kDa, and it migrates as a single 26-kDa band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which is unusually smaller when compared with other known sialidases. <i>T. infestans</i>sialidase hydrolyzes preferentially α2→3-linked sialic acids at pH 4–8, with maximal activity between pH 5.5 and 6.5, which is compatible with the optimal pH of secreted sialidases. The sialidase is competitively inhibited by 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-<i>N</i>-acetyl-neuraminic acid (<i>K</i> <sub>i</sub> = 0.075 mm) and differently from many sialidases, with exception of <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>sialidase, it is inhibited competitively by HEPES (<i>K</i> <sub>i</sub> = 15 mm). The fact that <i>T. infestans</i> sialidase is released with the saliva and can hydrolyze sialyl-Lewis<sup>X</sup> blood groups, which are the ligands for selectins, suggests that it might have a role in the blood feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2014465548,"The transcription of various viral and cellular genes is regulated by palindromic and nonpalindromic DNA sites resembling the EP element of the hepatitis B virus enhancer, which generate similar DNA-protein complexes. The upper EP complex contains homodimers of the transcription regulator RFX1. We show that RFX1 possesses a split, extended dimerization domain composed of several evolutionarily conserved boxes, one of which was previously shown to mediate dimerization. Such an unusually long and complex dimerization domain could potentially serve for generating multiple complexes. In addition to the previously characterized complex, RFX1 generated a novel DNA-protein complex of extremely low mobility, formed only with palindromic DNA sites. Different deletions within the dimerization domain altered the relative abundance of the two complexes, suggesting an interplay between them. Formation of the low mobility complex correlated with transcriptional repression, in that both activities were mediated by several portions of the conserved region. Our results propose a mechanism by which the extended dimerization domain mediates the formation of alternative homodimeric complexes, which differ in the nature of the intersubunit interaction. By participating in different types of interactions, this domain may regulate the relative abundance of the different complexes, thus affecting transcriptional activity."

Because this pattern is similar to that which is observed for purified ORC bound to DNA, the post-replicative complex may consist only of ORC. The mechanisms that govern the switch from the pre-replicative complex to the post-replicative complex remain to be established fully. However, the cyclin-dependent kinases, including Clb-associated Cdc28 in budding yeast and Cdk2-cyclin E in higher eukaryotes such as Xenopus, are likely to play a key role (11Jackson P.K.

Despite the conservation of several ORC subunits from yeast to metazoans, the identification of replicator sequences in higher eukaryotes has proven elusive. The functional reconstitution of a metazoan ORC might provide an avenue for the identification of replication origins in more complex eukaryotes. Furthermore, this reconstituted complex would facilitate the elucidation of mechanisms governing initiation of DNA replication in higher eukaryotic chromosomes. Xenopus egg extracts have proven highly valuable for the study of cell cycle events such as DNA replication in vitro. Previous studies have established an essential role for two Xenopus homologs of budding yeast ORC subunits (Xorc1 and Xorc2) in the initiation of DNA replication (18Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R.

In particular, we have focused on an 81-kDa protein (p81) that is tightly associated with a complex containing Xorc2. cDNA cloning studies indicate that p81 is highly homologous to putative human and mouse proteins of previously unknown function. Although p81 does not possess an obvious homolog in S. cerevisiae, it displays some limited sequence identity to the budding yeast Orc3 protein. Removal of p81 from Xenopus egg extracts completely abolishes the capacity of these extracts to carry out chromosomal DNA replication. Hence, p81 appears to be an essential replication factor in higher eukaryotes. Cytostatic factor-arrested egg extracts were prepared from unactivated Xenopus eggs as described by Murray (21Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Cytostatic factor-arrested extracts were induced to enter the interphase state by the addition of 0.4 mmCaCl2. Interphase extracts were also supplemented with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide to prevent the entry into mitosis. S phase cytosol was prepared according to the method of Smythe and Newport (22Smythe C. Newport J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 449-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Extracts from developmentally staged Xenopus embryos were prepared as described (23Shou W. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To isolate Xorc2-associated proteins, interphase egg extracts (3–5 ml) were treated with anti-Xorc2 antibodies (18Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) covalently coupled to the Affi-Prep protein A support (Bio-Rad) by the method of Schneider et al. (24Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, 100 μg of anti-Xorc2 antibodies was coupled to 50 μl of protein A beads and incubated with egg extract for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were collected and extensively washed three times with extract buffer (80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm EGTA, and 15 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, three times with extract buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.4 m sodium chloride, three times with extract buffer alone, and once with HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES-KOH and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Finally, the beads were resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (10 mmTris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. A small aliquot of the eluted fraction was subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis and either silver-stained or processed for immunoblotting with either anti-Xorc1 (20Rowles A. Chong J.P. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) or anti-Xorc2 antibodies. The eluted proteins from several preparations were combined and concentrated with a Filtron microconcentrator. The concentrated eluate was treated with 15 mm dithiothreitol and 50 mmiodoacetamide prior to electrophoresis on a preparative 8% polyacrylamide gel. Xorc2-associated bands were visualized by staining for 20 min with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue (dissolved in 20% methanol and 0.5% acetic acid) and destaining for 1 h with 30% methanol. One band, termed p81 due its apparent molecular mass of 81 kDa, was excised from the gel and processed for peptide sequencing by the California Institute of Technology Protein/Peptide Micro Analytical Laboratory. Amino acid sequences were obtained from three tryptic fragments as follows: peptide A, TSLTVADYFNEGLR; peptide B,XEFVFKPSAK; and peptide C, VALHTALNNPASYLK. Xdenotes an unreadable amino acid. 32P-Labeled orthophosphate (500 μCi/μl) was added to cytostatic factor-arrested extracts containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and incubated for up to 1 h at 23 °C to allow incorporation into endogenous ATP. The extract was split in half. One aliquot was activated with calcium, and the other was kept arrested at metaphase. After an additional 30-min incubation, the extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Xorc2 antibodies bound to protein A beads. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed as described above, except that the first three washes also contained 1 μm microcystin, resuspended in SDS gel sample buffer, and electrophoresed on 10% SDS gels. Radiolabeled bands were visualized by autoradiography or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and processed for phosphoamino acid analysis (25Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 210: 110-149Crossref Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Six degenerate oligonucleotides were designed from the sequences of the p81 tryptic peptides. One combination of primers was found to amplify an internal 1.6-kb fragment of Xenopus p81 in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These two primers are as follows: B-forward, 5′-ACIGTIGCIGA(T/C)TA(T/C)TT(T/C)AA(T/C)GA(A/G)GG-3′; and C-reverse, 5′-(G/C)(T/A)IGCIGG(G/A)TT(G/A)TTIA(G/A)IGCIGT(G/A)TG-3′. The PCR conditions of Mueller et al. (26Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) were used. After electrophoresis of the PCR products, the 1.6-kb band was reamplified and subcloned into the pCRII cloning vector (Invitrogen). This fragment was radiolabeled by the random primer method using a kit from Life Technologies, Inc. and used to screen 106 clones from aXenopus oocyte cDNA library (18Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Eighteen cDNA clones were isolated; the longest one (a 2.3-kbApaI-XhoI fragment) was sequenced on both strands using an automated DNA sequencer. By conceptual translation, this cDNA was found to contain an 81-kDa open reading frame. Although the presumed initiation codon is not preceded by an in-frame termination codon, it does reside in a good Kozak consensus sequence (27Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3577) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the apparent molecular mass of recombinant histidine-tagged p81 (84 kDa) is 3 kDa larger than that of endogenous p81 in Xenopus egg extracts detected with anti-p81 antibodies. Thus, the 2.3-kb cDNA appears to contain the full-length coding sequence of p81. We expressed Xenopus p81 using the BAC-to-BAC baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The full-length coding sequence of p81 was subcloned into pFastBacHTa via a triple-ligation strategy. An NcoI restriction site was engineered at the initiation codon by PCR with Pfu polymerase. A 1.3-kbNcoI-XbaI fragment and a 1.0-kbXbaI-XhoI fragment, which together contained the entire coding sequence, were ligated to pFastBacHTa that had been digested with NcoI and XbaI. p81 protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells as described previously (26Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 28Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The protein was isolated from the inclusion body fraction of solubilized Sf9 cells in essentially pure form and used to immunize rabbits for polyclonal antibody production. Antibodies directed against p81 were affinity-purified essentially as described (10Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), except that p81 was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose beads after it had been solubilized in 8 m urea. GST-p21N (29Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) was prepared as described for p21 (11Jackson P.K. Chevalier S. Philippe M. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Immunodepletions of Xenopus interphase extracts with anti-p81 antibodies were performed as described (18Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), except that three rounds of depletion were performed. For each round, 30 μg of anti-p81 antibodies was used per 50 μl of egg extract. For the rescue of p81-depleted extracts, demembranated sperm chromatin was incubated in S phase cytosol (22Smythe C. Newport J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 449-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) for 5 min and then diluted with 2 volumes of extract buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, 0.1 m KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm sucrose, pH 7.7) supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 7 μm ATP. The “loaded” chromatin was then centrifuged in a Beckman Microfuge E containing a horizontal rotor for 1 min at 4 °C. Either p81-depleted or mock-depleted extracts were added to the pellet containing the loaded chromatin. DNA replication assays were performed as described (18Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with anti-Xorc2 antibodies was performed as described (18Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with anti-p81 antibodies was performed in BLOTTO (26Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and proteins were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We previously demonstrated that Xorc2 is essential for chromosomal DNA replication in Xenopus extracts (18Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Xorc2 is found in a large multiprotein assembly, suggesting that it resides in XORC (18Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 20Rowles A. Chong J.P. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 30Romanowski P. Madine M. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). By immunoprecipitation with anti-Xorc2 antibodies, we observed the presence of several Xorc2-associated proteins (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). Immunoblotting of anti-Xorc2 immunoprecipitates confirmed that Xorc1 and Xorc2 reside in the same multiprotein complex (Fig. 1, Band C, lanes 1) (20Rowles A. Chong J.P. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 30Romanowski P. Madine M. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was clear from silver staining of the immunoprecipitates that at least four or five proteins tightly associated with Xorc2 (63 kDa) even after stringent washes in 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1% CHAPS (Fig. 1 A; see “Experimental Procedures”). In addition to Xorc1 (115 kDa), there were polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 81, 78, 46, and 40 kDa. The 78-kDa band also appeared in immunoprecipitates with control antibodies (albeit at lower levels) and thus may represent a nonspecific binding protein. Typically, the 81-kDa band silver-stained more intensely than Xorc2 in these preparations, suggesting that it might be more abundant than Xorc2 in the complex. However, when large-scale anti-Xorc2 immunoprecipitates were stained with Coomassie Blue, the amounts of p81 and Xorc2 were found to be comparable (data not shown), suggesting that p81 may stain anomalously well with silver. To characterize the Xorc2-containing complex in greater detail, we examined the phosphorylation of its various constituent proteins during the cell cycle. For this purpose, M phase and interphase egg extracts were radiolabeled with 32P and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Xorc2 antibodies (Fig. 2 A). Only Xorc1 and Xorc2 became detectably phosphorylated under these experimental conditions. The labeling of both proteins was stronger at M phase (Fig. 2 A, lane 1), but significant phosphorylation of both Xorc1 and Xorc2 could also be detected in interphase extracts (lane 3). Similar amounts of both Xorc1 and Xorc2 were immunoprecipitated from M phase and interphase extracts under these conditions (data not shown). The functional significance of the M phase phosphorylation is not known, but it does correlate with the dissociation of XORC from the condensed chromosomes at M phase (10Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies with both human and frog Mcm (mini-chromosome maintenance) replication proteins have also revealed a similar correlation between protein phosphorylation and chromatin association (reviewed in Ref. 2Dutta A. Bell S.P. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that extensive phosphorylation of some replication proteins serves to remove them from the chromatin during M phase. Significantly, the interphase phosphorylation of Xorc1 and Xorc2 was unaffected by 15 μm GST-p21N, a Cdk (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor that completely blocks both Cdk2-cyclin E activity and DNA synthesis in egg extracts (data not shown). By phosphoamino acid analysis, we found that the M phase forms of Xorc1 and Xorc2 were phosphorylated on both serine and threonine, whereas the interphase forms appeared to contain mostly phosphoserine. In conclusion, Xorc1 and Xorc2 appear to be the most heavily phosphorylated subunits of XORC, and their phosphorylation increases greatly at M phase. To isolate enough of the Xorc2-containing complex for peptide sequencing, we carried out multiple large-scale immunoprecipitations. From ∼20 ml of egg extract, we obtained approximately 10 μg of each Xorc2-associated protein. Our interest first centered on p81, an 81-kDa polypeptide that migrates between Xorc1 and Xorc2 (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). The sequences of three tryptic peptides from p81 were used to design degenerate oligonucleotides for PCR. One combination of primers yielded a 1.6-kb PCR fragment, which was used to screen aXenopus oocyte cDNA library (18Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Eighteen positive clones were isolated, and the largest one, pC84-1A, was found to contain ∼2300 nucleotide base pairs and to encode a predicted protein of 81 kDa (Fig. 3). We used the sequence of Xenopus p81 to search against current data bases using the BLAST and PSI-BLAST programs (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59437) Google Scholar). p81 possesses no obvious structural motifs that might lend a clue to its biochemical function, although it does have a potential bipartite nuclear localization signal at residues 533–546 (KKLLEMKETRRTKK). p81 was found to be highly homologous to several human expressed sequence tags of unknown function (GenBankTM accession numbers of a few examples are U50950,AA317247, and H94935). The homologous expressed sequence tags were derived from a variety of tissues including retina, heart, colon, and brain. In addition, p81 was found to be strongly homologous to several expressed sequence tags from embryonic mice (e.g.GenBankTM accession numbers AA073564 and W98988). We found no significant sequence similarities between Xenopus p81 and any proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, or Arabidopsis. A directed search with Xenopus p81 against the S. cerevisiae genome yielded no significant sequence homologies with an E value of <0.01. A subthreshold score was detected between p81 and budding yeast Orc3 (GenBankTMZ73109; E value of 3.4 with the PSI-BLAST program). Three other budding yeast proteins scored higher than Orc3 in this search. These include a protein of unknown function (GenBankTMD50617), a putative transcriptional regulatory protein (GenBankTMZ35827), and a subunit of the proteasome (GenBankTMZ75169). Overall, p81 shares 21% identical residues with budding yeast Orc3. An internal region of p81 (residues 215–406) is ∼25% identical to residues 201–400 of budding yeast Orc3. Thus, it is possible that p81 represents a novel, highly diverged form of Orc3 present in higher eukaryotes. To characterize the functional properties of p81, we first expressed p81 with a six-histidine tag at its N terminus in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells. Recombinant His6-p81 (Fig. 4 A), which migrated as an 84-kDa band on SDS gels due to the addition of the histidine tag, was used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. The anti-p81 antibodies, which reacted strongly with His6-p81, also recognized an endogenous 81-kDa polypeptide in Xenopus egg extracts (Fig. 4 A), which migrated at the same position as immunopurified p81 (data not shown). Since p81 had been isolated originally by immunoprecipitation with anti-Xorc2 antibodies, we asked whether the anti-p81 antibodies could be used to immunoprecipitate Xorc2 from egg extracts. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with anti-p81, anti-Xorc2, or control antibodies that had previously been coupled to protein A. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed extensively and eluted with SDS, and the SDS-eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with either anti-Xorc2 (Fig. 4 B) or anti-p81 (Fig. 4 C) antibodies. The results clearly demonstrate that Xorc2 could be efficiently immunoprecipitated with anti-p81 antibodies and that these antibodies could immunoblot the 81-kDa protein that had been immunoprecipitated with anti-Xorc2 antibodies. p81 and Xorc2 appeared to be tightly associated in the same complex since these two proteins could still be co-immunoprecipitated after washing in solutions containing 2 m NaCl or 1m urea or in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% SDS (data not shown). To characterize the expression of p81, we examined the levels of p81 as well as those of Xorc2 in developmentally staged Xenopusembryos. Embryos from a variety of stages, including ones before and after the mid-blastula transition (stage 8.5), were prepared and processed for immunoblotting with anti-p81 and anti-Xorc2 antibodies (Fig. 4 D). The results indicate that p81 and Xorc2 are present through at least stage 28 of development (tail bud stage). Additionally, we found that p81 is present in Xenopus tissue culture cells and could be co-immunoprecipitated with Xorc2 in these cells (data not shown). Thus, p81 does not appear to be restricted to early embryonic cells with a very rapid S phase. To assess the role of p81 in DNA replication, we depleted endogenous p81 from interphase egg extracts by treatment with anti-p81 antibodies. Because of the high abundance of p81 in egg extracts (∼5 ng/μl; data not shown) and the relatively low affinity of the anti-p81 antibodies, we found it necessary to use three rounds of depletion. After this procedure, we could no longer detect any p81 in the depleted extracts relative to extracts that had been treated with a control antibody (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 2). Significantly, we also could not detect any Xorc2 protein in p81-depleted extracts (Fig. 5 B). Because Xorc2 could not be detected in p81-depleted extracts, we asked if p81 could be found in extracts that had been depleted of Xorc2. Interphase extracts were treated with anti-Xorc2 or control antibodies as described previously (18Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Essentially all of the Xorc2 was removed (Fig. 5 C), and DNA replication was reduced to 5% of the control level in this extract (data not shown). We then determined the concentration of p81 in this Xorc2-depleted extract. By immunoblotting, there was no detectable p81 protein in Xorc2-depleted extracts (Fig. 5 D). Collectively, these results indicate that Xorc2 and p81 are associated quantitatively in the same complex. Next, we measured the abilities of the p81-depleted and mock-depleted extracts to carry out the replication of exogenously added sperm chromatin. We performed a continuous labeling in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP for 2 h at 23 °C and assessed the extent of DNA synthesis by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5 E, lanes 1 and 2). We observed that incorporation of 32P into chromosomal DNA was virtually abolished in interphase extracts that had been depleted of p81. This inhibition of replication was not a consequence of the inability of the extract to form intact nuclei around sperm chromatin, a requirement for DNA replication in the Xenopus cell-free system, since nuclear assembly occurred at similar rates in the p81-depleted and control extracts (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the immunodepletion procedure might irreversibly inactivate the extracts, we attempted to restore the replicative capacity to the p81-depleted extracts. Because recombinant p81 from Sf9 insect cells is completely insoluble and because endogenous p81 is present in a multiprotein complex in egg extracts, we did not attempt to rescue the p81-depleted extracts with exogenously added, recombinant p81. Instead, we asked whether chromatin that had been preloaded with XORC in S phase cytosol (22Smythe C. Newport J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 449-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) could be replicated upon subsequent transfer to p81-depleted extracts. Indeed, we found that loaded chromatin underwent replication at an efficiency of ∼80% in p81-depleted extracts relative to control depleted extracts (Fig. 5,E and F). The loaded chromatin by itself did not undergo replication unless incubated in a complete, membrane-containing extract (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that removal of p81 and its associated proteins (including Xorc2) from egg extracts completely abolishes the replication of chromosomal DNA. However, this defect can be bypassed if chromatin already containing XORC is added to the p81-depleted extract. In this report, we have analyzed the composition of XORC fromXenopus egg extracts. We have used highly specific antibodies against Xorc2 to immunopurify a multiprotein complex consisting of Xorc2 and up to five additional polypeptides. Similar preparations of anti-Xorc2 antibodies, which recognize a single 63-kDa protein in egg extracts by immunoblotting, were used previously to immunodeplete Xorc2 and its associated proteins quantitatively fromXenopus egg extracts (18Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These Xorc2-depleted extracts are completely defective in chromosomal DNA replication, indicating that the Xorc2-containing complex has an essential role in this process. In addition to Xorc2 (p63), the immunoisolated complex consists of Xorc1 (p115), p81, p78, p45, and p40. Although a protein with the same mobility as p78 can be immunoprecipitated to some extent with control antibodies, the remaining five polypeptides (p115/Xorc1, p81, p63/Xorc2, p45, and p40) bind specifically to beads containing anti-Xorc2 antibodies. Among the unidentified proteins, we first focused our attention on p81. By cloning the cDNA encoding p81 and expressing recombinant His6-p81, we were able to prepare antibodies that could immunodeplete this protein from extracts of Xenopus eggs. Immunodepletion with anti-p81 antibodies also resulted in the quantitative removal of Xorc2. Similarly, by immunodepleting with anti-Xorc2 antibodies, we were able to completely remove p81 from egg extracts. These experiments establish that both p81 and Xorc2 are quantitatively associated in the same complex. Furthermore, both p81 and Xorc2 appear to be tightly associated with this complex since both polypeptides can be co-immunoprecipitated with one another after washes in buffers containing 2 m NaCl, 1m urea, or relatively harsh detergents (e.g. 1% CHAPS or a mixture of 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% SDS). Significantly, p81-depleted extracts are also completely defective in chromosomal DNA replication. In previous studies, two groups have also observed multiple proteins within putative XORC. Rowles et al. (20Rowles A. Chong J.P. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) isolated a complex of up to nine polypeptides using anti-Xorc1 antibodies to follow its purification through a number of chromatographic steps. These polypeptides include p168, p115/Xorc1, p110, p86, p74, p63/Xorc2, p50, p46, and p40. Of these, p110 and p50 were relatively minor components. Furthermore, p86 did not cofractionate precisely with p115/Xorc1 and p63/Xorc2 during MonoS chromatography. In other studies with anti-Xorc1 antibodies, Romanowski et al. (30Romanowski P. Madine M. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were able to immunoprecipitate a complex of five proteins, including Xorc1, Xorc2, a protein that migrated between Xorc1 and Xorc2 on SDS gels, and two proteins that migrated between Xorc2 and a 45-kDa marker protein. Although the composition of XORC could not be established conclusively in these two studies, it appears that this complex consists of five to nine polypeptides, including at least one unknown protein with a molecular mass of 74–85 kDa that migrates between Xorc1 and Xorc2 on SDS gels. A generally similar polypeptide composition has been observed for ORC from Drosophila (17Gossen M. Pak D.T.S. Hansen S.K. Acharya J.K. Botchan M.R. Science. 1995; 270: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Based upon our studies, it appears that the p81 described in this paper is also present in the XORC preparations of both Rowles et al. (20Rowles A. Chong J.P. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and Romanowskiet al. (30Romanowski P. Madine M. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although p81 possesses close homologs of previously undetermined function in humans and mice, there appears not to be an obvious homolog of this protein in budding yeast (E < 0.01). This conclusion is based on a search of the S. cerevisiae genome with the BLAST and PSI-BLAST programs. Among the budding yeast ORC subunits, p81 scored highest with Orc3, raising the possibility that p81 might represent a highly diverged form of Orc3 found in higher eukaryotes. Although homologs of S. cerevisiae Orc1, Orc2, Orc4, and Orc5 have been readily identified in metazoans (2Dutta A. Bell S.P. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), homologs of Orc3 and Orc6 have not been described thus far in other organisms. This might suggest that these particular subunits have not been conserved as stringently during evolution. In principle, p81 could be an integral component of XORC that is required for initiation of replication on DNA templates, and indeed, this is the simplest and most obvious possibility. The limited similarity between p81 and budding yeast Orc3 would be consistent with this interpretation. The lack of close similarity between p81 and the budding yeast ORC subunits might be explained by a difference between origins of replication in higher eukaryotes and yeast. Alternatively, it is formally possible that p81 could represent either a tightly associated regulator of XORC or a factor that collaborates with XORC in the replication process.

https://openalex.org/W2048844254,"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) nuclear translocator (Arnt) gene has been isolated and characterized from a mouse genomic DNA library. The gene is about 60 kilobases long and split into 22 exons. An unusual exon/intron junctional sequence was found in the 11th intron of the gene that begins with GC at its 5′-end. The exon/intron arrangement of mArnt gene differs greatly from those of the other members of the same basic-helix-loop-helix/PAS family. The gene is TATA-less and has several transcription start sites. The promoter region of the mArnt gene is GC-rich and contains a number of putative regulatory DNA sequences such as two GC-boxes, a cAMP-responsive element, E-box, AP-1 site, and CAAT-box. Deletion experiments revealed that all these DNA elements made substantial contributions to a high level of expression of the gene, except for the cAMP-responsive element. Of all, two GC-boxes displayed the most dominant enhancing effects. It was demonstrated that there exist specific factors binding to these DNA elements in the nuclear extracts of HeLa cells. Among them, Sp1 and Sp3, and CAAT-box binding factor-A were identified to bind the GC-boxes and CAAT-box, respectively. Expression of MyoD in HeLa cells stimulated the Arnt promoter activity by binding to the E-box.

Recent molecular cloning and biochemical studies have demonstrated that in the nuclei, Arnt forms a heterodimer with AhR that is activated by binding with a ligand such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin to activate expression of the genes for a group of drug-metabolizing enzymes through binding to the xenobiotic response element sequence upstream of the genes (6Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition, the AhR-Arnt heterodimer is also considered to mediate the various biological effects such as teratogenesis, tumor promotion, epithelial dysplasia, and immunosuppression by aromatic environmental pollutants usually represented by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, the most toxic chemical, although the target genes for the heterodimer in these effects remain to be elucidated (6Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Arnt also forms a homodimer that binds the E-box and potentially activates the genes driven by the promoter containing the E-boxes (7Sogawa K. Nakano R. Kobayashi A. Kikuchi Y. Ohe N. Matsushita N. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1936-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that Arnt forms heterodimeric complexes with HIF-1α and HIF-1α-like factor to regulate genes involved in the response to hypoxic conditions (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar), and disruption of the Arnt gene by homologous recombination resulted in embryonic death of mice because of abortive angiogenesis and defective responses to glucose and oxygen deprivation (8Emin M. Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Simon M.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that Arnt plays a central role in transcriptional regulation by the bHLH-PAS transcription factors as a key partner molecule in the formation of transcription/regulation-competent dimers. It would be interesting to elucidate the structure of the Arnt gene with regard to an evolutionary aspect of a gene family of the bHLH-PAS transcription factors and the regulatory mechanism of its transcription. In this study, we have cloned and characterized the mouse Arnt gene, whose structure consists of 22 exons and is more complex than that of AhR, and elucidated multiple regulatory DNA elements in the promoter region and their trans-acting regulatory factors. A 129/SV mouse genomic library (Stratagene) was screened by using a full-length of mouse Arnt cDNA and its BamHI/EagI fragment of mouse Arnt cDNA (about 0.8 kb) as hybridization probes as described (9Junsei M. Ema M. Sogawa K. Ikawa S. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Pharmacogenetics. 1994; 4: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Positive clones were isolated and their sequence analyses were performed as described (9Junsei M. Ema M. Sogawa K. Ikawa S. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Pharmacogenetics. 1994; 4: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Introns 4 and 8 that were not covered with the cloned DNAs were amplified with PCR by using the LA Taqkit (Takara) and two pairs of 35-mer primers that anneal to the 3′-ends of exons 4 and 8 and the 5′-ends of exons 5 and 10. Genomic DNA from the liver of C57BL/6 mice was used for PCR as templates, and the PCR products were subcloned into pBluescriptII SK(+) for sequencing. Total RNA was prepared from C57BL/6 mouse skeletal muscle by the guanidinium method (10Glisin V. Crkvenjakov R. Byus C. Biochemistry. 1973; 13: 2633-2637Crossref Scopus (1543) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+RNA was purified with oligo(dT) latex (Takara). For RNase protection assay (11Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Pharmacogenetics. 1993; 3: 213-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), a 296-base pairNcoI/AvaI fragment of the genomic clone A18, which was subcloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript II SK(+), was used for synthesis of a riboprobe by using [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol) and T7 RNA polymerase. The RNase protection experiments were carried out as described (12Schmidt J.V. Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22203-22209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-RACE was performed according to the protocol of Life Technologies, Inc. Poly(A)+RNA was reverse-transcribed by using a gene-specific primer (Gsp1) complementary to the sequence of +243 to +267 of mArnt mRNA and Super ScriptII reverse transcriptase at 42 °C. The first strand mArnt cDNA was amplified by PCR using a poly-GI adaptor primer (AP) and a nested mArnt-specific primer (Gsp2) complementary to the sequence of +218 to +242 of mArnt mRNA. The amplified products were subjected to gel electrophoresis, and the elongated band was subcloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript II SK(+) for sequencing with the dye terminator method (Applied Biosystems). The oligonucleotide primers used are given as follows in the 5′ to 3′ direction: AP, GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG; Gsp1, TGACCGTCGCTTAATAGCCCTCTG; Gsp2, CAACAGCTCCTCCACCTTGAATCC. The 5′-flanking region (+12 to −1666) of the mArnt gene was inserted into theSmaI site of the luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3 Basic Vector) (Promega). Introduction of various deletions in the 5′-flanking region and transfection experiments using HeLa cells were performed as described (13Henikoff S. Gene. 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2828) Google Scholar, 14Kobayashi A. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol.

The LacZ reporter gene pBos-LacZ (1 μg) was cotransfected with the luciferase reporter genes as an internal control, and the luciferase activities were normalized against the β-galactosidase activity. A 329-base pairSacII/NdeI fragment (+12 to −317 of the mArnt gene) of the genomic clone mA18 was subcloned into the SmaI site of pGL3-basic vector. The fragment was 32P-labeled at the XhoI and Asp-718 site for the downstream and upstream end-labeling, respectively. Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were prepared by the method of Schreiber et al. (15Muller M.M. Schreiber E. Schaffer W. Matthias P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6420Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A series of treatments for the DNase I footprinting analysis were performed as described (14Kobayashi A. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase as probes: mAGC2, 5′-GTTTGGGGCGTGTCTTCTGC-3′; mAGC1, 5′-GACTTACTGTTTCTATTGGCCAGTTC-3′; mACBF, 5′-GACTTACTGTTTCTATTGGCCAGTTC-3′; mAAP-1, 5′-CCGAGTCACTAGCCCGGCCTCTAT-3′; mAEbox, 5′-ATTAGGGAAACAGCTGGTTGGC-3′; and mACRE, 5′-ATTTCACTGACGTCAATTTGG-3′. mACBFm (5′-GACTTACTGTTTCTAaTcGCCAGTTC-3′), mAAP-1 (5′-CCGAGTCcCgAGCCCGGCCTCTAT-3′), mAEboxm (5′-ATTAGGGAAACAcCTtGTTGGC-3′), and mACREm (5′-ATTTCACTtACGgCAATTTGG-3′) are mu- tated versions of the respective oligonucleotides as described above.

The nucleotides contained in the core sequences are designated with capital letters. GMSA was performed with nuclear extracts from HeLa cells as described (19Watanabe N. Kitazume M. Fijisawa J. Yoshida M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For super shift analysis, polyclonal antibodies against Sp1, Sp3, C/EBP, CREB-1, c-Jun, E-12, E-47, human bHLH factor, c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), CBF-A, CBF-B (Rockland, Inc.), and MafK (a kind gift of Dr. M. Yamamoto, Tsukuba University) were preincubated with nuclear extracts from HeLa cells at 0 °C for 10 min before addition of the labeled probes. The E-box in the mArnt promoter was mutated in a site-directed manner by the method of splicing by overlap extention (20Horton R.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 15: 251-261PubMed Google Scholar). The mAEboxm1 and mAEboxm2 were used as primers for introducing the mutagenesis. The mArnt promoter (+12 to −1666)-luciferase construct PGL3mAPr (−1666) or its mutant PGL3mAPr (−1666)m with a mutated E-box was cotransfected into HeLa cells with an expression plasmid for mouse MyoD, PcDNA3mMyoD (a kind gift from Dr. Nabeshima, Osaka University), or with PcDNA3 plasmid used as a control. A series of treatments for this experiment were performed as described above. Sequence analysis of all the clones, mA3, mA8, mA9, mA18, and mA16 isolated from a SV/129 mouse genomic library showed that the Arnt gene is split into 22 exons. Because the mA3, mA8, and mA9 do not overlap with each other, we tried to fill in these gaps by the PCR method. Unique PCR products of 7- and 4-kb were generated for the respective gaps, and sequence analysis of the bands revealed that the 7- and 4-kb DNA fragments overlapped with the parts of mA3 and mA8 and with those of mA8 and mA9, respectively (data not shown). Consequently, total length of the mArnt gene is about 60-kb long (Fig. 1). Exon 5 is an alternative exon and is omitted in a short form of the mArnt mRNA (3Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.-F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The two forms of mArnt mRNA encode two Arnt proteins, which have not been known to differ with regard to function and mode of expression. To determine the 5′-end of the Arnt gene, the RNase protection assay was performed to yield three major protected fragments as shown in Fig. 2. Because RNA has a lower mobility in the denaturing polyacrylamide/urea gel than DNA of the same size, we confirmed the result by the 5′-RACE. Among 9 clones analyzed, 5, 3, and 1 started at positions +1, +7, and +9, which correspond to the 139, 133, and 131 nucleotide fragments of the RNase protection experiments, respectively, indicating that +1 is the major transcriptional start site of the Arnt gene. No TATA-like sequence was found in the 5′-flanking region of the 5′-end of the mArnt gene. Instead, the sequence of the promoter region is GC-rich as is often found in the TATA-less genes (Fig. 4).Figure 2Ribonuclease protection mapping of the 5′-end of the Arnt gene. Total RNA of 40 and 60 μg from mouse skeletal muscle cells were used in lanes 5 and 7, respectively. The pBluescript II SK(+) sequence ladder was used as size marker (lanes 1–4). Yeast tRNA (50 μg) was used as control (lane 6). The undigested riboprobe was in lane 8.

A few of the genes were reported to have this unusual GC sequence at the 5′-end of the intron boundary (21King C.R. Piatigorsky J. Cell. 1983; 32: 707-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22Dodgson J.B. Engel J.D. J. Biol.

The physiological role of this unusual junction sequence has yet to be established. When the sites of introns of the mArnt gene relative to the amino acid sequence is compared with those of the other members of the bHLH/PAS protein family such as mAhR, dSim, mHIF-1α and mArnt2, 2Y. Oda, K. Yamamoto, K. Sogawa, and Y. Fujii-Kuriyama, unpublished data. the Arnt gene shares few sites of splicing junctions with mAhR (Fig. 3), dSim, and mHIF-1α, but has much in common with mArnt2 (data not shown). Even in the gene structure coding for the most conserved bHLH/PAS region, the splicing junction sites of the mArnt gene barely resemble those of mAhR gene and others except for mArnt2 gene. From the similarity of the amino acid sequence, it has been proposed that the bHLH/PAS proteins are mainly divided into the two groups represented by AhR and Arnt, respectively. Because the genes for AhR, HIF-1α, and dSim share many the splicing junction sites with one another (26Luo G. Gu Y.-Z. Jain S. Chan W.K. Carr K.M. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Gene Expr. 1997; 6: 287-299PubMed Google Scholar), different gene organization between AhR and Arnt gene supports the two divisions of the bHLH/PAS transcription factors (27Ema M. Morita M. Ikawa S. Tanaka M. Matsuda Y. Gotoh O. Saijoh Y. Fujii H. Hamada H. Kikuchi Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5865-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although the mArnt promoter contains no TATA-box, sequence analysis of the promoter region has revealed several potential cis-acting DNA elements as shown in Fig. 4. To determine how these DNA elements contribute to the mArnt promoter activity, we constructed a fusion gene, pGL3mAPr (−1666), by ligating the promoter sequence (−1666 to +12) of the Arnt gene with the 5′-end of the luciferase gene in the pGL3-Basic vector and transfected it into several cultured cell lines, HeLa, Hepa-1, and 293T cells. Because HeLa cells gave the highest luciferase activity (280-fold over the control level) and are known to express endogenous Arnt mRNA, we chose to use HeLa cells for the transient transfection experiment. Then we introduced various external deletions from the 5′-end of the promoter sequence into the fusion gene and determined the expressed luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 5, the deletions progressing through the −207 position caused gradual reduction in the promoter activity and finally showed no enhancement in the luciferase expression at the −29 position. The most pronounced reductions were noted when the sequence from −67 to −56 and from −57 to −29, which contain the GC-box1 and GC-box2, respectively (Fig. 4), were deleted. In the deletion process, the promoter activity was reduced concomitantly with the deletion of several DNA fragments, which contain the other putative enhancer elements: E-box (−207 to −139), AP-1 (-139 to −112), and CAAT-box (−112 to −86) sequences. To investigate whether there exist specific DNA binding factors on these regulatory sequences in the nuclear extracts of HeLa cells, DNase I footprinting analysis was performed. When increasing amounts of the nuclear extract were added, five regions from −31 to −62, −88 to −113, −116 to −140, −189 to −210, and −250 to −270 were distinctly protected from DNase I digestion (Fig. 6, A, lanes 3–6 and B, lanes 3–6). As described in Fig. 4, these regions contain the putative GC-boxes, CAAT-box, AP-1 site, E-box, and CRE, respectively. To investigate in detail the factors that interact with the protected sequences, GMSA were performed using the synthesized oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequences defined by the DNase I footprinting analysis as probes. As shown in Fig. 7, all the five probes formed complexes with the factors in the nuclear extract from HeLa cells and gave specific retarded bands. Although the GC-box1 and GC-box2 have a similar sequence to the consensus sequence of the GC-box recognized by Sp1 and its related factors, their patterns of bound complexes in GMSA were subtly different from each other. One major and two minor bands were observed with the GC-box1 and GC-box2, whereas two extra faint bands were associated only with the GC-box2. When the nuclear extracts were treated with anti-Sp1 antibody, the major retarded band of the two DNA probes was supershifted with the other minor bands being apparently unaffected. On the other hand, the anti-Sp3 antibody eliminated the two minor bands, whereas the major band and the two extra faint bands formed by GC-box2 remained unaffected. It is clear from the results that GC-box1 and 2 were mainly recognized and bound by Sp1 and their small parts were by Sp3. Concerning the proteins binding to the CAAT-box, the retarded band formed by CAAT-box was supershifted by anti-CBF-A antibody but not by anti-CBF-B or by anti-C/EBP antibodies, indicating that the CAAT-box was bound by CBF-A, but not by C/EBP. It has been reported that CBF-A forms a heterotrimer with CBF-B and CBF-C for binding with the CAAT-box (28Kim I.S. Sinha S. De Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4003-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The reason why anti-CBF-B antibody did not give a supershift could be considered by one of the possibilities that the heterotrimer formed by CBF-A, CBF-B, and CBF-C could structurally prevent CBF-B from reacting with its antibody and that CBF-A forms a heterocomplex with some other partner molecules rather than CBF-B. We tried to identify specific trans-acting factors on the putative AP-1 site, E-box and CRE by using anti-c-Jun, anti-MafK (29Motohashi M. Igarashi K. Onodera K. Takahashi S. Ohtani H. Nakafuku M. Nishizawa M. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), anti-E-47, anti-c-Myc, anti-E-12, anti-human bHLH factor and anti-CREB-1 antibodies. However, none of these antibodies affected the mobility of these retarded bands. In addition, an oligonucleotide of the AP-1 site in the promoter of polyoma virus gene (18Piette J. Hirai S.I. Yaniv M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3404-3405Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) failed to compete with the AP-1 probe (Fig. 7 C). Similarly, no competition was observed between the putative E-box and the E-box sequence of acetylcholine receptor ε-subunit gene (17Numberger M. Durr I. Kues W. Koenen M. Witzemann V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the other hand, retarded bands of the putative CRE of the Arnt disappeared by competition with the oligonucleotide of CRE of the human collagenase gene (16Deutsch P.J. Hoeffler J.P. Jameson J.L. Lin J.C. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18466-18472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the CRE of the Arnt is able to work as functional CRE, but was not bound with CREB in HeLa cells. The regions between −62 and −88 and between −210 and −250, which were also weakly protected in DNase I footprinting, were subjected to GMSAs by using nuclear extracts from HeLa cells but did not give any specific retarded bands. To examine whether MyoD could affect the mArnt promoter activity by binding to the E-box sequence, we cotransfected an expression plasmid for mouse MyoD with either PGL3mAPr (−1666) or its mutant PGL3mAPr (−1666)m into HeLa cells as described. As shown in Fig. 8, the mouse MyoD could stimulate the mArnt promoter substantially, whereas the PGL3mAPr (−1666)m with a mutation in the E-box displayed essentially no enhancement in the luciferase expression by the MyoD expression plasmid. These results indicate that expression of MyoD can enhance the mArnt promoter activity through the E-box in HeLa cells and suggest that expression of Arnt is activated in the tissues such as muscle where MyoD is expressed. Using the 5′-RACE and RNase protection assay, we mapped transcription start sites of the mArnt gene to three major sites (Fig. 2). In consistence with multiple transcription start sites, we found no TATA sequence in their 5′-upstream proximity as also the case with the AhR gene. Multiple transcription start sites and GC-rich sequences in the promoter region are often reported with the “housekeeping” genes that have a TATA-less promoter (30Blake M.C. Jamblou R.C. Swick A.G. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6632-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 31Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (2979) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis has shown that the Arnt gene is about 60-kb long and is split into 22 exons. The structure of the Arnt gene is very different from and more complex than that of the AhR gene. Even in the gene structure encoding the most conserved amino acid sequence of the bHLH/PAS domain, the exon/intron arrangement is different between the two genes. This conversion of the exon/intron arrangement has been already reported with several gene families and is suggested to be generated by insertion or deletion of introns during the evolutionary process (32Fyrberg E.A. Bond B.J. Hershey N.D. Mixter K.S. Davidson N. Cell. 1981; 24: 107-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus far, several gene structures of the bHLH/PAS superfamily such as AhR, HIF-1α, HIF-1α-like factor, Drosophila Sim and Trachealess have been reported and their exon/intron arrangements are conserved well among them (4Isaa D.D. Andrew D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 12Schmidt J.V. Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22203-22209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Luo G. Gu Y.-Z. Jain S. Chan W.K. Carr K.M. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Gene Expr. 1997; 6: 287-299PubMed Google Scholar). From sequence similarity, the bHLH/PAS transcription factors are mainly divided into two groups represented by AhR and Arnt, respectively (27Ema M. Morita M. Ikawa S. Tanaka M. Matsuda Y. Gotoh O. Saijoh Y. Fujii H. Hamada H. Kikuchi Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5865-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The members described above resemble AhR in the amino acid sequence rather than Arnt and they are classified into the AhR group. Different gene structure of Arnt from those of the bHLH/PAS factors of the AhR group indicates that the gene structure has been differentiated since the division of the two groups. Recently the gene structure of Arnt2, which belongs to the Arnt group, has been found to be highly similar to that of Arnt. In the upstream region of this TATA-less gene, several interesting potential regulatory sequences such as GC-box, AP-1 site, CAAT-box, E-box, and CRE were found as shown in Fig. 4. Transient DNA transfection experiments using a fusion gene consisting of the upstream sequence of the Arnt gene and the luciferase structural gene demonstrated that the upstream sequence has transcriptional enhancer activity in HeLa cells. Various deletions in the upstream sequence could locate the regulatory DNA sequences whose deletions resulted in a marked reduction in the expressed luciferase activity. These DNA fragments contain the putative regulatory DNA elements described above, indicating that they contribute substantially to the expression of luciferase, except for the CRE whose deletion was apparently not very influential in this expression system. The deletion of one of the two GC-boxes displayed most profound effects on the expression driven by the Arnt promoter, suggesting that the two GC-boxes cooperatively enhance the expression of the gene. DNase I footprinting analysis demonstrated that the nuclear extracts specifically protected those presumed regulatory DNA elements from digesting by DNase I, therefore, indicating the presence of the factors binding to those DNA elements. Although it showed little promoter activity in the transient DNA transfection assay, the CRE sequence was also protected. The putative CRE sequence is a complete 8-base palindromic sequence and could function as a cis-acting regulatory DNA element in other types of cells. Gel mobility shift assay demonstrated the presence of specific factors binding to those regulatory DNA elements in HeLa cells. Experiments using anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, and anti-CBF-A antibodies showed that the two GC-boxes were bound for major part by Sp1 and for minor by Sp3 and that the CAAT-box was bound by CBF-A. It remains to be specified what regulatory factors bind to the putative AP-1 site, CRE, and E-box sequences, because GMSAs using anti-c-Jun, MafK, CREB-1, E12, E47, c-Myc, and human bHLH factor antibodies did not give any supershifted bands. Furthermore, typical oligonucleotides of the AP-1 site and E-box sequences did not compete with probes of the corresponding regulatory sequences of Arnt in GMSA. It is likely that the sequences flanking with the core recognition sequences of Arnt is critical for binding to a nuclear factor of HeLa cells. Further studies are necessary to determine which factors binds these DNA elements including CRE for elucidating the mechanism of the Arnt gene expression. The members of MyoD family are cell-type-specifictrans-acting factors and play an important role in the expression of muscle-specific genes through binding to the E-box in their promoter regions (33Rudnicki M.A. Schnegelsberg P.N.J.

Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the expression of mArnt mRNA is the highest in muscle among the tissues examined, although mArnt mRNA was expressed ubiquitously (35Hirose K. Morita M. Ema M. Mimura J. Hamada H. Fujii H. Saijo Y. Gotoh O. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1706-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MyoD by transfecting the MyoD expression plasmid into HeLa cells enhanced the expression of the luciferase activity driven by the mArnt promoter, suggesting that the Arnt expression is stimulated in the tissues such as muscle, which express MyoD. Ubiquitous expression of Arnt in various tissues of embryos and adult animals can be generated by cooperative functions of multiple transcription factors bound on the respective regulatory DNA elements. These factors could be changed in different tissues. It would be interesting to identify these regulatory factors in various cultured cells and tissues and clarify how they interact with one another to enhance the expression of the gene. We thank Drs. M. Yamamoto (Tsukuba University) and Y. Nabeshima (Osaka University) for anti-MafK antibody and PcDNA3mMyoD plasmid, respectively. We are also grateful to H. Abe for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1986026444,"Previous studies identified and partially characterized a 42-base pair regulatory element in the 5′-flanking region of the L1 transcript of the murine growth hormone (GH) receptor gene that interacted with both double- and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. We present evidence that the double-stranded DNA-binding protein is NF-Y, a CCAAT box-binding protein. Experiments with a dominant negative form of NF-Y indicate that NF-Y does not play a direct role in regulating the activity of the FP42 element. A cDNA clone that specifically interacts with the upper (coding) strand of the regulatory element was isolated by screening a cDNA expression library using the Southwestern technique. DNA sequencing, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, Southwestern blot analysis, and supershift EMSA confirm the identity of the single-stranded binding protein to be MSY-1, a DNA-binding protein that is evolutionary conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Mapping of single-stranded DNA configurations reveals that MSY-1 can facilitate the formation of single-stranded DNA regions in the GH receptor 5′-flanking region. Transient transfection experiments support the role of MSY-1 as a repressor of GH receptor gene activation. Southwestern blot analysis indicates that the levels of nuclear MSY-1 are decreased in the livers of pregnant mice, suggesting a role for MSY-1 in the increased expression of the GH receptor during pregnancy."

In rat C6 glioma cells, LDH-A mRNA is stabilized by activation and synergistic interaction of protein kinases A and C. In the present study, we aimed to identify the sequence domain which determines and regulates mRNA stability/instability by protein kinase A and focused our attention on the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of LDH-A mRNA. We have constructed various chimeric globin/lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) genes linked to the c-fos promoter and stably transfected them into rat C6 glioma cells. After their transfection, we determined the half-life of transcribed chimeric globin/ldh mRNAs. The results showed that at least three sequence domains within the LDH-A 3′-UTR consisting of nucleotides 1286–1351, 1453–1471, and 1471–1502 are responsible for the relatively rapid rate of LDH-A mRNA turnover in the cytoplasm. Whereas chimeric globin/ldh mRNAs containing the base sequences 1286–1351 and 1453–1471 were not stabilized by (S p)-cAMPS, an activator of protein kinase A, instability caused by the 1471–1502 domain was significantly reversed. Additional deletion and mutational analyses demonstrated that the 3′-UTR fragment consisting of the 22 bases 1478–1499 is a critical determinant for the (S p)-cAMPS-mediated LDH-A mRNA stabilizing activity.

The LDH-A subunit, for instance, is subject to regulation by a number of different effector agents such as estrogen (3Lee C. Oliver L. Coe E.L. Oyasu R. J. Natl.

The functional importance of these LDH isoenzyme shifts is generally attributed to a need for increased A subunit-containing isoforms (such as LDH-4 or -5), which can derive more energy from the anaerobic pathway by reducing pyruvate to lactate. Investigations into the mechanism of LDH-A gene expression has identified two basic controls consisting of a transcription-regulatory cascade (4Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are major determinants of intracellular LDH-A mRNA levels. Messenger RNA turnover rates fluctuate over a wide range, and it is important to identify and characterize putative stability-regulating mRNA domains and their interacting factors that may be responsible for these functional effects. A great number of reports have demonstrated the existence of such domains and theirtrans-acting regulatory factors that are critical in determining the half-life of mRNA (13Ross J. Mol. Biol. Med. 1988; 5: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar). Several of these studies indicate that the stability of some, but not all, mRNA is determined by specific cis-acting AU-rich domains located in the 3′-UTR. For example, a number of mRNAs such as cytokine, lymphokine and protooncogene mRNAs share a common sequence motif with a high content of A and U nucleotides in the 3′-UTR (14Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and exhibit half-lives in the range of only a fraction of 1 h (15Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar, 16Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1987; 7: 4513-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In addition, attention has focused on modulation of mRNA stability in response to a variety of physiological signals. For instance, histone mRNA stability is regulated by the cell cycle (19Schümperli D. Cell. 1986; 45: 471-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and intracellular iron levels control the stability of transferrin receptor mRNA (20Casey J.L. Hentze M.W.

Science. 1989; 246: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Moreover, manipulation of cells with several different effector agents can alter the steady-state level of mRNA during cell growth or differentiation and may exhibit tissue-specific variations (14Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that in addition to stability-regulating RNA domains effector agent-responsive protein factors may be involved in determining mRNA stability and that they could be subject to regulation by agents that activate second messenger signal pathways. It has recently been demonstrated that activators of protein kinases A and C are important effectors of mRNA stability regulation in a number of gene systems (14Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is known that increased levels of either cAMP or phorbol ester are sufficient signals for increased LDH-A mRNA stability, the molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of cAMP or phorbol ester on mRNA stability have not been defined in detail. Based on our previous data (4Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5312-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar), we suggested that sequences within the non-coding regions of LDH-A mRNA together with protein kinase-regulated RNA-binding phosphoprotein(s) may play a pivotal role in determining the basal and regulated stability of mRNA (12Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tian, D., Huang, D., Brown, R. C., and Jungmann, R. A. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, in pressGoogle Scholar). In the present study, we have chosen to identify putativecis-regulatory domains within the 3′-UTR of LDH-A mRNA that are involved in protein kinases A-mediated mRNA stability regulation. Our initial approach was to express transfected chimeric β-globin/ldh 3′-UTR constructs and to evaluate the functional effects of protein kinase A on chimeric mRNA stability. Furthermore, applying ribonuclease protection assay to determine the half-life of truncated and mutated fragments of LDH-A 3′-UTR, we systematically analyzed the 3′-UTR for the presence of (a) sequence domain(s) that cause mRNA instability, and (b) stability-regulatory domain(s) whose activity is modulated by protein kinase A. Our experiments demonstrate that several 3′-UTR fragments evoked marked instability of the otherwise relatively stable β-globin mRNA. Most importantly, we were able to identify a uridine-rich cAMP-stabilizing region (CSR) responsible for regulating the rate of LDH-A mRNA turnover in response to activators of protein kinase A and the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. Nucleic acid-modifying enzymes, acrylamide, nucleoside triphosphates were from Boehringer Mannheim. Radioisotopes were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Other reagents were of molecular biology grade and purchased from Sigma. Cell culture products were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (S p)-Adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate ((S p)-cAMPS) and (R p)-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate ((R p)-cAMPS) were from BIOLOG Life Science Institute. Synthesis and processing of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and their ligation into the respective plasmid vectors were performed as described previously (23Kwast-Welfeld J. Soong C-J. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6941-6947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat C6 glioma cells (ATCC CCL 107) were maintained as monolayers in Ham's F-10 nutrient medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg of streptomycin as described by us (9Derda D.F. Miles M.F. Schweppe J.S. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11112-11121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at about 90% confluence, and serum was withdrawn 16–18 h prior to addition of various agents. A rat fibroblast LDH-A cDNA clone (pLDH-2), provided by Dr. Richard Breathnach, contains the full-length 1609-bp cDNA insert. The mRNA has a 103-nucleotide 5′-nontranslated region and a 510-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region, corresponding to nucleotides 1103 through 1613 (5Matrisian L.M. Rautmann G. Magun B.E. Breathnach R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 711-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR contains the classic polyadenylation signal AAUAAA 18 nucleotides before the poly(A) sequence. A HinfI/BamHI fragment containing the entire LDH-A 3′-UTR (with 28-bp 5′ coding sequence and 100-bp pLDH-2 vector sequence) was inserted into pGem3Zf(−) at the BamHI site resulting in plasmid pLDH-5. Plasmid pLDH-6 was constructed to retain the complete 3′-UTR but eliminate the 28-bp LDH-A coding and 100-bp pLDH-2 vector sequences contained in pLDH-5. Using oligonucleotide primers, the complete 510-base pair 3′-UTR of LDH-A with 5′ BamHI and 3′ HindIII sites was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from pLDH-5. The fragment was cloned into the BamHI/HindIII sites of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). The rabbit β-globin expression vector pRc/FBB was constructed by Dr. D. Chagnovich (Northwestern University) in two steps from plasmids pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) and pBBB (kindly provided by Dr. M. E. Greenberg). To that purpose, pRc/CMV was linearized withBglII and blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase. After insertion of a decamer containing a SacII restriction site, the resulting vector was cut with SacII and HindIII to excise the cytomegalovirus promoter and to serve as acceptor for the modified pBBB. For this modification aSacII-Nru I fragment was excised from pBBB and replaced with HindIII linkers. After restriction withSacII, pRc/FBB was created by linking modified pBBB with the modified SacII-HindIII fragment of pRc/CMV. Plasmid pRc/FBB encodes a transcription unit consisting of β-globin coding region flanked by the β-globin 5′- and 3′- untranslated regions fused to the c-fos promoter. The sequence and correct orientation of all inserts were verified by restriction and DNA sequence analyses. Sequencing was carried out in both directions by the dideoxynucleotide chain terminator method with specific synthetic oligonucleotides as primers. One day prior to transfection, cell cultures were prepared by seeding 1 × 105 cells/60-mm plate in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Each plate was treated with 100 μg of Lipofectin in 2 ml of Opti-MEM I for 20 min after which 10 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA were added. After 16 h, the Lipofectin solution was replaced with 3 ml of DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. Two days following transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated at several dilutions between 1:5 and 1:10 in selective medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin). Cells were fed with selective medium every third day until resistant colonies were clearly visible (after about 2 weeks). Individual drug-resistant colonies were subcloned and expanded under selection conditions. Total cytoplasmic RNA was prepared as described (12Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Transcripts derived from the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene and the various transfected chimeric β-globin/ldh 3′-UTR vectors were detected by RNase protection analysis of 5 μg of RNA isolated at various times after serum stimulation and addition of effector agents using32P-labeled complementary rabbit β-globin antisense probes (24Rodger J.R. Johnson M.L. Rosen J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 572-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The complete antisense β-globin probe was synthesized with the MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit from the rabbit β-globin gene cloned into pBluescript. Radioactivity corresponding to the protected fragments was visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a BAS III FUJI radioanalytic imaging scanner. The half-life of LDH-A mRNA and various chimeric globin/ldh mRNAs was calculated by a nonlinear regression analysis of the results using the InPlot program (GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA). The decay of chimeric globin/ldh mRNAs from the linker-scanning studies was quantitated using Real-Time PCR detection with a 7700 ABI PRISM Sequence Detection system using the TaqMan PCR reagent kit (Perkin-Elmer) with two fluorogenic probes: 6-carboxyfluorescein as the reporter probe and 6-carboxy-tetramethylrhodamine as the quencher probe (25Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar). Isolation of genomic DNA and Southern blot hybridization analysis were carried out as described (26Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1987)Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vols. 1–2, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar). It is known that the presence of AU-rich regions in the 3′-UTR may function as destabilizing elements in several mRNAs. Sequence analysis of the LDH-A 3′-UTR identifies a 99-nucleotide stretch (nucleotides 1450–1549), which is relatively AU-rich when compared with the overall nucleotide composition of the 3′-UTR. Whether or not this AU-rich region contains a site(s) that determines LDH-A mRNA stabilizing/destabilizing activity and can additionally be modulated through protein kinase signal pathways has so far not been determined. As a first step to experimentally identify stability/instability elements in the 3′-UTR of LDH-A mRNA, we replaced the 3′-UTR of β-globin mRNA in plasmid pRc/FBB with the entire LDH-A 3′-UTR and then determined the rate of decay and half-life of the chimeric globin/ldh mRNA under various experimental conditions. By choosing an expression vector (pRc/FBB) with a serum-inducible c-fospromoter (15Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar, 27Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar, 28Shyu A.-B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), we also avoided artifacts that potentially occur when commonly used transcriptional inhibitors such as actinomycin D (29Harrold S. Genovese C. Kobrin B. Morrison S.L. Milcarek C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Scott W.A. Tomkins G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 40: 273-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) are used to stop ongoing transcription. To perform the decay studies, the pRc/FBB/ldh construct was introduced into rat C6 glioma cells by stable transfection. G418-resistant colonies were pooled to ensure a heterogeneity of integration sites. Quantitative ribonuclease protection assays for each chimeric vector were performed to measure mRNA half-lives. After serum-starving the transfected cells for 25–30 h, pulse induction of the chimeric globin/ldh gene under the control of the c-fos promoter was done by addition of fetal calf serum. Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated at subsequent time points and ribonuclease protection assays were done. As shown in Fig. 1 (panel A, lane wt β-globin), wild-type β-globin mRNA was remarkably stable and persisted in the cytoplasm with a half-life of about 21 h (extrapolated from Fig. 1, panel B), similar to data obtained by others (28Shyu A.-B.

In stark contrast, the chimeric β-globin/ldh mRNA (panel A, lane Control) decayed at a much faster rate (t 1/2 ≈ 70 min) (Fig. 1, panel B), similar to the rapid rate of decay of wild-type LDH-A mRNA (t 1/2 ≈ 55 min) in glioma (4Jungmann R.A.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar). For each chimeric vector the decay data consistently obeyed first-order kinetics. Since the basal mRNA levels may reflect the copy number of integrated globin genes after transfection, we analyzed the copy number of integrated globin genes by Southern blot analysis (not shown). We found that the average number of integrated globin copies is nearly the same for all transfected cells. By treating the transfected cells with the protein kinase A agonist, (S p)-cAMPS, we found that the activated protein kinase had the ability to alter the stability of chimeric globin/ldh mRNA. (S p)-cAMPS significantly prolonged the half-life of hybrid globin/ldh mRNA (panel A, lane Sp-cAMPS) but not that of wild-type globin mRNA (not shown). For instance, the half-life of globin/ldh mRNA increased from about 70 min in untreated cells to about 8 h in (S p)-cAMPS-treated cells (seepanel B). Inasmuch as the above data suggested the involvement of protein kinase A and, hence, protein phosphorylation, we sought additional insight into the significance of potential phosphorylation events by preventing protein phosphorylation through the use of inhibitors of protein kinase A. We used the selective protein kinase A antagonist (R p)-cAMPS to prevent protein kinase activation. The results summarized in Table I show that (R p)-cAMPS blocks protein kinase A-mediated stabilization of globin/ldh mRNA. Furthermore, we used okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases-1 and -2A (34Haystead T.A.J. Sim A.T.R. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P. Hardie D.G. Nature. 1989; 337: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), to shift the overall balance of phospho-/dephosphoproteins in favor of the phosphorylated proteins. Exposure of transfected cells to okadaic acid (20 nm) resulted in a much slower decay and a markedly enhanced stability of globin/ldh mRNA (see Fig. 2).Table IEffect of an activator and inhibitor of protein kinase A on stability regulation of chimeric globin/ldh mRNATreatmentHalf-life (t½)None69 ± 4 min(S p)-cAMPS (500 μm)8.7 ± 1.25 h(R p)-cAMPS (500 μm)78 ± 4 minRat C6 glioma cells were stably transfected with pRc/FBB in which the globin 3′-UTR was replaced with the entire LDH 3′-UTR fragment. Cells were treated for 6 h with the indicated concentrations of agents. After addition of serum, RNA was isolated at various time points up to 12 h. Globin/ldh mRNA decay was assessed by ribonuclease protection assay, and half-lives were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as mean and S.E. of four separate experiments. Open table in a new tab Rat C6 glioma cells were stably transfected with pRc/FBB in which the globin 3′-UTR was replaced with the entire LDH 3′-UTR fragment. Cells were treated for 6 h with the indicated concentrations of agents. After addition of serum, RNA was isolated at various time points up to 12 h. Globin/ldh mRNA decay was assessed by ribonuclease protection assay, and half-lives were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as mean and S.E. of four separate experiments. Thus, the studies show that the half-life of chimeric globin/ldh mRNA and its regulation are similar, if not identical, to that of wild-type LDH-A mRNA and that the 3′-UTR contains all elements needed to (a) destabilize LDH-A mRNA and (b) to convey protein kinase-mediated stability to globin mRNA. We conclude that regulation of LDH-A mRNA stability is an inherent function of its 3′-UTR and that it is not, or is only to some minor degree, affected by other regions of the mRNA (such as coding regions and 5′-UTR). Based on above data, we proceeded to identify putative regions within the LDH-A 3′-UTR that are (a) instrumental in determining instability of LDH-A mRNA and (b) responsible for the protein kinase-mediated stabilization of the mRNA. To that purpose, we generated a series of systematically truncated 3′-UTR fragments that were inserted into the unique BglII site located at the junction of the β-globin translated and 3′-untranslated regions in pRc/FBB (35van Ooyen A. van den Berg J. Mantei N. Weissmann C. Science. 1979; 206: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3). This produced vectors with a globin reporter gene, which, upon transcription, yielded unique chimeric globin/ldh mRNAs whose decay characteristics and half-lives were determined. As in each vector the promoter (c-fos) and globin coding regions are identical, the transcripts differ from each other only in their 3′-UTR sequence. In our studies, the density of autoradiographic bands corresponding to various mRNAs was normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, since this mRNA was stable under the experimental conditions regardless of the presence or absence of effector agent. The normalized band of highest density was taken as the starting decay time point. The basal half-lives of the different truncated chimeric globin/ldh mRNAs are shown in Fig. 3. The half-life of several chimeric mRNAs was only slightly lower (between 18 and 20 h) than that of wild-type β-globin mRNA (about 21 h), and they decayed less than 10% over the 12-h time course of the experiment (time course not shown). In contrast, insertion of fragments 1286–1351, 1453–1470, 1463–1502, 1463–1527, and 1471–1502 had a marked destabilizing effect and the corresponding chimeric mRNAs exhibited significantly reduced half-lives. From these data, we infer that LDH-A 3′-UTR contains at least three destabilizing elements located in fragments 1286–1351, 1453–1470, and 1471–1502. The regulatory effect of protein kinase A on the stability of short-lived chimeric globin/ldh mRNAs (see Fig. 3) was analyzed after stimulation of transfected cells with the second messenger (S p)-cAMPS. The results are shown in Table II. Chimeric mRNAs transcribed from vectors with inserted fragments 1286–1351 and 1453–1470 were destabilized, but their stability was not affected by treatment of cells with (S p)-cAMPS. In contrast, cells transfected with a vector containing fragment 1453–1527, 1463–1502, or 1463–1527 transcribed a chimeric mRNA that was not only destabilized but responded to (S p)-cAMPS treatment of cells with a significant stabilization of the corresponding globin/ldh mRNAs. When fragment 1463–1502 was further shortened to bases 1471–1502, the resulting chimeric globin/ldh mRNA was destabilized and cells responded to (S p)-cAMPS treatment with stabilization of the mRNA. Further truncation resulted in a loss of (S p)-cAMPS responsiveness (see below). Thus, the data show that fragment 1471–1502 contains the sequences that are necessary for the stabilizing effect of (S p)-cAMPS.Table IIEffect of (Sp)-cAMPS on the half-life of chimeric globin/ldh mRNAsFragment inserted (base no.)Half-life(S p)-cAMPS/controlControl(S p)-cAMPSh1103–16101.2 ± 0.68.3 ± 0.97.11286–13513.9 ± 0.53.1 ± 0.70.81453–14702.9 ± 0.93.6 ± 1.21.21453–15274.5 ± 0.315.6 ± 2.13.51463–15024.1 ± 0.617.5 ± 2.14.31463–15273.7 ± 0.716.9 ± 2.44.61471–15023.9 ± 0.817.8 ± 2.54.6Rat C6 glioma cells were stably transfected with pRc/FBB in which the listed fragments of LDH-A 3′-UTR (with 5′ and 3′ BglII ends) had been inserted into the BglII site of pRc/FBB (see Fig. 3). Cells were treated in serum-free medium for 6 h with 0.5 mm (S p)-cAMPS. After addition of serum, RNA was isolated at various time points up to 12 h.

To expand and confirm the above data, we carried out a stability analysis of LDH-A 3′-UTR in which partial base sequences had systematically been deleted from the 3′-UTR. Globin 3′-UTR in pRc/FBB was removed byBglII/HindIII digestion and replaced with truncated LDH-A 3′-UTR fragments. After stable transfection of the vectors into rat C6 glioma cells, the vectors were transcribed, and the decay characteristics of the chimeric globin/ldh mRNAs were analyzed. The half-lives determined by this analysis are summarized in Table III.

G protein-coupled receptors or so called seven-transmembrane receptors constitute the largest gene family known to date (1Savarese T. Fraser C. Biochem.

It is estimated that this family consists of 5,000 members (4Intelligent Drug Design (1996) Nature 384, (suppl.) 5Google Scholar).

In addition, congenital receptor dystrophies lead to a wide variety of functional heterogeneous disorders for which the molecular pathogenesis remains unknown (6Clapham D. Cell. 1993; 75: 1237-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Many of these mutations seem to affect the biogenesis of these receptors. Yet, the molecular components and mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of seven-transmembrane receptors have for the most part not been identified. The light receptors, opsins, constitute a class of homologous receptors that are key players in the activation of the photo-transduction cascade across species (7Okano T. Kojima D. Fukada Y. Shichida Y. Yoshizawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5932-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 8Applebury M. Soc. Gen. Physiol.

Bioessays. 1993; 15: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Opsins are continuously produced in large amounts in photoreceptors and constitute about 90% of the membrane protein content of the outer segments of vertebrate photoreceptors (11Molday R.S. Molday L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2598-2601Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These cells likely express a highly efficient biogenic machinery to process and sort in a vectorial fashion the vast amounts of opsin produced in these cells. Thus, photoreceptors constitute an excellent model system to dissect the biogenic machinery of seven-transmembrane receptors. In Drosophila melanogaster, at least nine different gene products specifically affect the functional production of several opsin subclasses in photoreceptors (12Larrivee D.C. Conrad S. Stephenson R. Pak W.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 78: 521-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Stephenson R. O'Tousa J. Scavarda N. Randall L. Pak W.L. Cosens D.J. Vince-Price D.

Among these, the ninaA gene encodes a retina-specific cyclophilin/peptidyl prolyl cis-transisomerase (PPIase) (15Shieh B.-H. Stamnes M. Seavello S. Harris G. Zuker C.S.

Cell. 1991; 65: 219-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), but mutations in this gene affect the production of only a subset of opsins, R1–6 opsin (12Larrivee D.C. Conrad S.

Cell. 1991; 65: 219-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the NinaA substrate specificity remains to be understood. We have identified in bovine retina a cyclophilin-related protein made up of multiple and well defined structural modules (18Ferreira P. Hom J. Pak W. J. Biol.

We have shown that the C-terminal supradomain of RanBP2, Ran-binding domain 4 (RBD4)1 and cyclophilin (CY), mediate the selective association of RanBP2 with a subclass of opsins, red/green opsins (22Ferreira P. Nakayama T. Pak W. Travis G. Nature. 1996; 383: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This effect consists in the sequential, direct, and selective PPIase-dependent modification of opsin by CY, production of an RBD4-binding competent isoform of opsin, binding of modified opsin to the C-terminal half of RBD4, and, in concert with the N-terminal half domain of RBD4, CY-mediated chaperoning of the modified opsin isoform to the C-terminal half domain of RBD4 (22Ferreira P.

A. 1997; 94: 1556-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This leads to the production in vitro of a novel and immunoreactive opsin isoform with no propensity to self-aggregate and an increase in vivo of functional opsin receptor (22Ferreira P. Nakayama T. Pak W. Travis G. Nature. 1996; 383: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23Ferreira P. Nakayama T. Travis G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1556-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on our results, we have proposed that prolyl-isomerization constitutes a novel molecular switch in receptor biogenesis (23Ferreira P. Nakayama T. Travis G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1556-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This switch is modulated by the PPIase activity of cyclophilin required for the formation of a transient opsin isoform competent to be loaded onto component(s) of the processing and/or sorting machinery (22Ferreira P. Nakayama T. Pak W. Travis G. Nature. 1996; 383: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23Ferreira P. Nakayama T. Travis G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1556-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that this molecular switch is widespread to other biological functions such as controlling cell-cycle division (24Yaffe M. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X. Stukenberg P. Rahfeld J. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M. Fischer G. Cantley L. Lu K. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) and gene expression activity (25Leverson J. Ness S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), possibly through PPIase-mediated conformational changes in substrate activity. RanBP2 is also a component of the Ran-GTPase cycle (26Rush M. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W.

Science. 1996; 272: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Yet, there is no RanBP2 orthologue in the yeast genome (27Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and RanBP2 is highly expressed in terminally differentiated neuroretinal cells (18Ferreira P. Hom J. Pak W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23179-23188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RanBP2 has also been localized at cytoplasmic fibrils emanating from the nuclear pore complex (19Yokoyama N. Hayashi N. Seki T. Pante N. Ohba T. Nishii K. Kuma K. Hayashida T. Miyata T. Aebi U. Fukui M. Nishimoto T. Nature. 1995; 376: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 20Wu J. Manutis M. Kraemer D. Blobel G. Coutavas E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar), thus supporting the proposal that RanBP2 may play a key role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of certain proteins and mRNAs. To better understand the RanBP2 role in cell function, it is of paramount importance to identify its molecular partners. To this end, we have extended structure-function studies to another RanBP2 domain, the cyclophilin-like domain (CLD) (18Ferreira P. Hom J. Pak W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23179-23188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We identified this domain as a region with low but significant homology to the C-terminal cyclophilin domain of RanBP2 (18Ferreira P. Hom J. Pak W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23179-23188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The results reported here link RanBP2 to the proteasome proteolytic pathway and possible proteolytic processing of RanBP2. Moreover, this process may be mediated by another protein such as a putative and novel kinesin-like motor protein. We discuss the implication of these findings in protein biogenesis.

When applicable, proteasome inhibitors, lactacystine and MG-132, were also added to the homogenization buffer at final concentrations of 20 nm and 20 μm, respectively. GST-RBD3-CLD-W1-W2, GST-CLD-W1-W2, GST-CLD, GST-RBD3-CLD, and GST-RBD3 constructs were prepared by subcloning, respectively, Klenow-treated SalI-BamHI,Sau96I-Sau96I, SalI-PvuII, and SalI-HphI fragments of CY15 clone (18Ferreira P.

Expression, purification, and concentration of GST-fused and thrombin-cleaved (unfused) constructs were carried out exactly as described before (18Ferreira P. Hom J. Pak W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23179-23188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Purified GST-fused and unfused proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie and/or silver-stain analysis. Incubation reactions of GST-fused constructs (2.2 μm) with bovine retinal extracts (80 μl, ∼2.5 mg of extract) and pull-down assays were carried out exactly as described previously (22Ferreira P.

Unfused construct (competitor) was used at 10 fold molar excess. Coprecipitates were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE after boiling in SDS-sample buffer. P112 purification was carried out by scaling-up the incubation binding assays ∼180-fold between eight 15-ml conical tubes. The washings of coprecipitates were scaled-up accordingly. Coprecipitates were boiled in SDS-sample buffer for 3–5 min and loaded on 7.5% preparative SDS-PAGE, stained with Fast Stain followed by electroelution of P112 bands into Centricons. Eluted P112 protein was concentrated, and 5% (v/v) of the total concentrated protein was resolved in SDS-PAGE in parallel with coprecipitates of analytical retinal binding reactions and analyzed by silver-stain. P99 purification procedure was carried out exactly the same way with the exception that incubation assays were scaled-up ∼360-fold, and 20% (v/v) of concentrated eluted protein was loaded on SDS-PAGE for silver-stain analysis. The rest of purified proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes, stained for 1–2 min with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 50% methanol and 1% acetic acid, washed several times with destaining solution (50% methanol, 1% acetic acid), followed by several washes with Millipore H2O. The blue-stained bands were cut and subjected to Edman degradation and amino acid composition analysis. Incubation reactions and pull-down assays were carried out as described before. GST-CLD coprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes, blocked, and incubated with PA700 antibody at 1:2,500 (gift from Dr. George DeMartino) by the same exact procedures previously described (22Ferreira P.

Bovine retinal extracts (150 μg) were loaded and resolved on SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes, blocked, and incubated with Cy321 antibody (1:5,000) by the same exact procedures previously described (22Ferreira P.

We continued the structure-function analysis of RanBP2 by the same exact methods we previously reported (22Ferreira P. Nakayama T. Pak W. Travis G.

To this end, we prepared a series of GST fused and unfused protein constructs containing the whole RBD3, CLD, W1, and W2 supradomain and several fragments thereof (Fig. 1). The GST-fused constructs were incubated with CHAPS-solubilized retinal extracts, and pull-down assays were carried out in search for coprecipitating proteins with binding activity to the bait proteins. Coprecipitating proteins were subjected to several washes followed by SDS-PAGE and silver-stain analysis. To test the specificity of the binding of retinal proteins to GST-fused constructs, free (unfused) bait was added to the incubation reactions to compete with the GST-fused construct for the target substrate (Fig. 2 a, lane 4). In certain reactions, nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogs were also added to test for nucleotide-dependent association of retinal substrate(s) with the bait moiety (Fig. 2 a, lane 5).Figure 2Identification of retinal CLD binding proteins. a, Silver-stain SDS-PAGE analysis of glutathione S-agarose coprecipitates of incubation reactions with GST-CLD. Incubation of GST-CLD with retinal extracts in the presence (lane 7) and absence (lane 2) of proteasome inhibitors lead to the coprecipitation of several retinal protein species. Among these, only P112 and P99 specifically coprecipitated with GST-CLD because addition of unfused CLD to the reactions abolished their association with GST-CLD (lane 3). Addition of ATPγS (lane 4) as well as GTPγS (not shown) and apyrase (lane 5) to the binding reactions resulted, respectively, in a decrease and no change of binding of P112 and P99 to GST-CLD. Addition of ATPγS to the incubation reaction also abolished the binding and lead to the association, respectively, of 70- and 68-kDa proteins. However, this effect was nonspecific, as it was observed also for other unrelated GST-fusion constructs (not shown).Lane 2 represents an aliquot (15 μg) of purified GST-CLD (asterisk) used in incubation reactions. The bands below GST-CLD are lower molecular weight degradation products of GST-CLD. b, retina-selective association of P112 and P99 with CLD of RanBP2. P112 and P99 did not coprecipitate with GST-CLD after incubation with liver (lane 2), kidney (lane 3), and spleen (lane 4) extracts.

Thus, we expressed these domains singly to facilitate SDS-PAGE analysis of binding activity of retinal substrates to GST constructs. In this study, we searched for retinal substrates that specifically associated with the CLD domain of RanBP2. Incubation of GST-CLD with retinal extracts under physiological conditions lead to the association to this construct of two proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 112 kDa, P112 (Fig. 2 a, arrow, lane 3), and 99 kDa, P99 (Fig. 2 a, filled arrowhead, lane 3). Binding of these proteins to the CLD moiety of GST-CLD was highly specific because these were the only two proteins whose association with the GST-construct could be disrupted by coincubation with free (unfused) CLD (Fig. 2 a, lane 4). This also showed that the 112- and 99-kDa bands represented single protein species. Moreover, these proteins did not bind other unrelated GST-fusion constructs such as GST-W1-W2 (not shown) and GST-RBD3 (not shown). P112 had a much higher binding activity toward CLD than P99, suggesting that P99 is specifically copurifying with P112. Association of P112 and P99 with CLD was reduced in the presence of ATPγS (Fig. 2 a, lane 5), but it was not affected by the presence of the ATP-degrading enzyme, apyrase (Fig. 2 a, lane 6), GTPγS, and GDPβS (not shown). Finally, incubation reactions carried out with retinal extracts prepared in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors (34Rock K. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar,35Palombella V. Rando O. Goldberg A. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar), lactacystine and MG-132, did not alter significantly the binding activity of these proteins to CLD (Fig. 2 a, lane 7). To investigate if the association of P112 and P99 with CLD was selective for retinal extracts, we incubated GST-CLD exactly under the same conditions with three different extracts prepared from bovine liver, kidney, and spleen tissues. The protein concentration of these were normalized to the same exact concentration as that for retinal extracts. To this end, binding activity of P112 and P99 to CLD was not detected with these tissue extracts (Fig. 2 b). To determine the identity of CLD-binding P112 and P99 proteins, we performed large scale retinal incubation reactions with GST-CLD. To this end, analytical incubation reactions were scaled-up approximately 180- and 360-fold for the purification of P112 and P99, respectively. GST-CLD coprecipitating proteins from large scale preparation reactions were loaded on large preparative SDS-PAGE, and retinal P112 and P99 were electroeluted and concentrated. To confirm the isolation and purity of the CLD-binding proteins, 5% (v/v) of the total amount of purified protein was run side-by-side in SDS-PAGE with analytical incubation reactions as well as with the remaining bulk of the purified protein. As seen in Figs. 3 a and 5 a, respectively, purified P112 and P99 comigrated exactly with those resolved from coprecipitates of analytical incubation reactions, albeit some lower molecular weight species were observed as a result of some degradation of the purified proteins.Figure 5Purification of retinal P99. a, retinal incubation reactions with GST-CLD were scaled-up, the P99 band was electroeluted and concentrated, and an aliquot was loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel for silver-stain analysis (lane 2) in parallel with analytical retinal incubation reactions (lanes 3–5) as described in Fig. 2 a. Purified P99 (arrow) migrated exactly at the same position (double-headed arrow) as the specific GST-CLD coprecipitating protein, P99, observed in analytical incubation reactions (lane 4). Some degradation of P99 (arrowhead) into P97 (open arrowhead) was observed. b, Coomassie Blue-stained PVDF blot of purified P99. P99 protein (arrowhead) and a slightly smaller proteolytic product of P99, P97 (open arrowhead), purified from retinal extracts were blotted onto a PVDF membrane and stained with Coomassie Blue before being subjected to Edman degradation analysis.

The replication of cellular and viral genomes is initiated at specialized regions of chromosomes referred to as origins of replication (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). These regions are recognized by initiator proteins that facilitate the formation of replication forks in a controlled manner. The initiator proteins are in most instances sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, and they frequently also have enzymatic activities. Binding of the initiator protein to the origin of replication leads to local alterations of the conformation of DNA. A significant event is the separation of the DNA strands that either stimulates an intrinsic helicase activity of the initiator protein or allows the recruitment of a separate DNA helicase. A pathway leading from the sequence-specific binding of the initiator protein to an origin of replication to a local unwinding of DNA has been well established for many organisms using either electron microscopy or biochemical techniques (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of information referred to above we do not understand the molecular details of the mechanisms by which the origins of replication are activated. We have been interested in the replication of the Herpes simplex virus type 1 (2Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The origins of replication in the HSV-11 genome are recognized by the virus encoded origin binding protein, a product of the UL9gene (3Elias P. O′Donnell M.E. Mocarski E.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The helicase activity is performed by the N-terminal domain (5Abbotts A.P. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 3125-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This domain contains the seven sequence motifs that constitute the hallmark of most DNA/RNA helicases (6Gorbalenya A.E.

Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The overall three-dimensional structure of this domain most probably resembles the 1A and 2A domains of the PcrA and Rep helicases (Fig. 1) (8Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B.

The C-terminal domain of OBP is responsible for sequence-specific binding to the viral origins of replication, oriS and oriL (10Weir H.M. Calder J.M. Stow N.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1409-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that structural elements found in the sequence CGTTCGCACTT contribute to the stability of the complex between OBP and oriS. The central element GTTCGCAC appears to contribute to most of the specificity of complex formation (11Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. Naylor A.M. McClements W.L. J. Biol.

Conflicting information exists regarding the stoichiometry of the complex formed between the C-terminal domain of OBP and its recognition sequence (4Olivo P.D. Nelson N.J. Challberg M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5414-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7330-7334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of OBP serves an additional function. It interacts with the viral single strand DNA-binding protein ICP8 (18Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This interaction dramatically stimulates the helicase activity of OBP, and it is essential for oriS-dependent DNA synthesis (18Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is reasonable to assume that this interaction facilitates an OBP-dependent unwinding of the viral origins of replication. The latter suggestion is supported by the observations that the C-terminal domain may recruit ICP8 to oriS and position ICP8 in the immediate vicinity of the alternating AT sequence (15Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). More recently it has been elegantly demonstrated that the interaction between OBP and ICP8 is required for a sequence-dependent unwinding of duplex DNA provided with single-stranded tails (20Lee S.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Together these observations argue that the C-terminal domain serves not only as an anchor for OBP to oriS but also controls the activity of the DNA helicase. We have now tried in quantitative terms to assess the contribution of different structural elements of the recognition sequence to the stability of the specific complex formed between OBP and oriS. Our results can be summarized in a model for the surface of recognition sequence in oriS that is contacted by OBP. A recent finding that a substitution of lysine 758 with alanine in HSV-1 OBP dramatically reduces the affinity of OBP for its recognition sequence suggests that a detailed model for the protein-DNA complex is now within reach (21Stow N.D.

The DNA binding domain of the origin binding protein of HSV-1 was fused to a histidine-linker in the N terminus. It will be referred to as HisΔOBP. Expression was induced in BL21-pLysS (DE3) Escherichia coli cells transformed with the pET3a/HisΔOBP vector (24Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol.

Logarithmically growing cells at 37 °C were induced at A 600 nm = 0.6 with 1 volume of 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in LB supplemented with 150 mg/liter ampicillin and 25 mg/liter chloramphenicol. After 3 h at 30 °C the cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with a cold buffer (50 mm glucose, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA). The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 mm benzamidine). Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 10%. The suspension was incubated for 10 min on ice. One-tenth volume of a high salt dilution buffer was added to achieve a final concentration of 0.15 m NaCl and 10% glycerol in the extract. The viscosity of the solution was reduced by mechanical shearing, using an Ultraturrax homogenizer at high speed. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm in a Beckman JA-20 rotor for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was diluted with 1 volume of equilibration buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole) and loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (Qiagen). The column was eluted with a 10–200 mm imidazole linear gradient, and 2-ml fractions were collected in tubes prefilled with 4 ml of the equilibration buffer used for S-Sepharose chromatography (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl). This was done in order to prevent precipitation of highly concentrated protein eluted from the nickel-Sepharose column. The final chromatography step was performed on an S-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column with a 0.05–1 m NaCl linear gradient in equilibration buffer. The purified protein was dialyzed against 50% glycerol buffer and stored at −20 °C.

Challberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7330-7334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with subsequent comparison to bovine serum albumin standards. All three methods gave similar protein concentration values. The duplex oligonucleotides were diluted in incubation buffer (50 mmpotassium phosphate pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) to a final concentration of 0.2 nm. They were mixed on ice with HisΔOBP in a total volume of 10 μl and incubated for 30 min. Binding curves for HisΔOBP interacting with the oligonucleotides described in Table I were generated by analyzing the samples by electrophoresis in 6% acrylamide gels (25Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Gels were run for 60 min in Tris-glycine at 4 °C as described previously (25Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations used were as follows: 0 nm, 0.22 nm, 0.275 nm, 0.36 nm, 0.55 nm, 1.1 nm, 11 nm, 110 nm, 1.1 μm, and 11 μm. The radioactivity in the bands corresponding to the protein-DNA complex and free DNA were quantified on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The ratio y of protein-DNA complex, AB, and total DNA, B* = AB + B, as defined below, were determined for each sample as shown in the figures. Curves were generated to fit the values using a statistical analysis described below. The curves represent the calculated relationship between the total protein concentration (x) and the concentration of protein-DNA complex divided by the total DNA concentration (y). The mathematical method applied here was also used to determine the binding constants from the equilibrium equations. 2.2 nmol of HisΔOBP was dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.15 m NaCl. The protein solution was treated with a 50-fold molar excess of 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (Pierce). The cross-linked HisΔOBP was then mixed with 10 pmol of the radiolabeled duplex oligonucleotide PE17/18 as well as 0.1 nmol of unlabeled PE17/18. The samples were loaded on a native 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) in Tris-glycine buffer. Electrophoresis was performed as described above. The bands corresponding to free DNA, complex II, and a complex that migrated even slower than complex II were excised. Only a very small amount of a band corresponding to complex I was detected under these conditions and it was not included in this analysis. The gel slices were incubated for 2 min at 100 °C in SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol) after which the protein was electroeluted (Schleicher & Schuell) in 1× SDS buffer. Electroeluted samples were desalted and concentrated by centrifugation using Microcon 30 (Amicon). The samples were then heated in SDS sample buffer before they were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 4–15% gradient gel. After electrophoresis the gel was blotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). A polyclonal antiserum against HisΔOBP was used with the Immun-Blot assay kit (goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) AP, Bio-Rad) to detect the oligomeric state of cross-linked HisΔOBP. The gel was calibrated using the Rainbow molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad, code RPN 755). TheHindIII-EcoRI fragment (oriS) of plasmid pORI was labeled at the HindIII site using [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol). The radiolabeled fragment was treated with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea as described previously (26Wissman A. Hillen W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A sample was also cleaved at G + A residues and used as a marker in electrophoresis as described elsewhere (27Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., More, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds)Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Section 7.5.4, Wiley, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Affinity chromatography was then used to isolate partially ethylated DNA that bound to HisΔOBP. A column of 250 μl of the nickel-Sepharose column was loaded with 0.1 mg of HisΔOBP in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 10% glycerol. 1 pmol, 6.7 × 106 cpm, of partially ethylated oriS was then applied to the column. DNA was eluted stepwise with increasing concentrations of NaCl in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 10% glycerol. DNA eluted from the column was then subjected to cleavage as described previously (26Wissman A. Hillen W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These samples were then analyzed on 8% sequencing gels. The formation of a specific complex between HisΔOBP and the duplex oligonucleotide was treated as a bimolecular reactionA + B ↔ AB, where A is HisΔOBP, B is DNA, and AB is the protein-DNA complex. [A], [B], and [AB] denote the concentrations of the three components. The equilibrium constant c, which is equal to the inverted value of the binding constant K b, is defined by the equation [A] × [B]/[AB] = c.[A*] and [B*] denote the total concentrations. Thus, [A] = [A*] − [AB] and [B] = [B*] − [AB] and ([A*] − [AB]) × ([B*] − [AB])/[AB] = c. If [AB]/[B*] is denoted by y and [A*] by x, it follows from the relation above that y = (x − xy − [B*]y + [B*]y 2)/c and thusy=([B*]+c+x)/(2[B*])±(([B*]+c+x)/(2[B*]))2−x/[B*](Eq. 1) Assuming that y equals 0 when x equals 0 and that c and [B*] are constant in the experiments considered here we can write the equationf([B*],c,x)=([B*]+c+x)/(2[B*])(Eq. 2) −(([B*]+c+x)/(2[B*]))2−x/[B*]where the notation of y is replaced by the function of f. For different values of x, denotedx 1, x 2, …,x n, the corresponding values of y, denoted y 1, y 2, …,y n, were determined experimentally as described above. The constants [B*] and c are determined by minimizing the sum of quadratic deviations∑i=1n(yi−f([B*],c,xi))2(Eq. 3) Thus the sum is derived with respect to [B*], the derivative is put equal to 0, and also the derivative with respect toc is put equal to 0. The system of the two equations is not a linear one. An iterative procedure was used to solve the system. A detailed description is available upon request. HyperChem was from Hypercube, Inc. RasMol was developed by Roger Sayle (Biomolecular Structures Group, Glaxo Wellcome Research & Development, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom). Several groups have characterized the sequence requirement for high affinity binding of OBP or its C-terminal domain to oriS (11Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. Naylor A.M. McClements W.L. J. Biol.

There is general agreement that the GTTCGCAC element embedded in the larger domain CGTTCGCACTT contains the structural elements necessary for the formation of a high affinity complex. The source of protein as well as the experimental conditions have, however, varied extensively, and reliable determinations of the binding constants are therefore lacking. We have now used the gel retardation technique in order to quantitatively characterize the interaction between the C-terminal domain of OBP, HisΔOBP, and its recognition sequence. A search for optimal conditions showed that the interaction was strongly influenced by the presence of bovine serum albumin (Table II). It is noteworthy that bovine serum albumin did not simply prevent irreversible denaturation of HisΔOBP but could be added to a highly diluted sample and restore high affinity binding (results not shown). Furthermore, we found that Mg2+ was not required for the formation of a specific complex between HisΔOBP and DNA (Table II).Table IIDetermination of optimal conditions for the formation of a specific complex between HisΔOBP and DNAKPO4, pH 7.4MgCl2NaClEDTAGlycerolDTTBSAK bmm%mmg/literm5031000.11020.022.5 × 1065031000.110225 × 1085031000.110252.5 × 1095056.5 × 10950258 × 109501054 × 10950353 × 109500.152 × 1095010051 × 109DTT, dithiothreitol.BSA, bovine serum albumin.The binding constant K b was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab DTT, dithiothreitol. BSA, bovine serum albumin. The binding constant K b was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To identify the different complexes that can be formed between HisΔOBP and DNA, a titration curve was made over a wide range of protein concentrations while keeping the concentration of the 36-base pair duplex oligonucleotide PE17/18 (Table I) constant at 200 nm (Fig. 2 a). We found that multiple complexes were formed. At low protein concentrations a complex, denoted complex I, was seen. At higher protein concentrations at least one additional complex, complex II, was detected. A further increase in protein concentration resulted in a decrease in the mobility of complex II, indicating the existence of complexes with a still higher protein content. A second titration experiment performed at a low concentration of DNA, 0.2 nm, revealed a binding constant of 8 × 109m−1 for complex I assuming a stoichiometry of 1:1 (Fig. 2 b). Several conflicting interpretations of experiments designed to elucidate the stoichiometry of complexes formed between the C-terminal DNA binding domain of OBP and its recognition sequence in oriS have been presented (14Martin D.W. Muñoz R.M. Oliver D. Subler M.A. Deb S. Virology. 1994; 198: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7330-7334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We and others have seen that mixing of different forms of the DNA binding domain and a duplex oligonucleotide containing the recognition sequence CGTTCGCACTT did not result in the formation of complexes with intermediate electrophoretic mobility (14Martin D.W. Muñoz R.M. Oliver D. Subler M.A. Deb S. Virology. 1994; 198: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It was interpreted to mean that heterodimers did not form on a single recognition sequence, and by inference, that the specific complex had a stoichiometry of one protein monomer per recognition sequence. In contrast, direct measurements of protein/DNA ratios using radiolabeled components as well as a supershift study using antibodies suggested that the specific complex consisted of two protein monomers bound to a single site (16Stabell E.C. Olivo P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5203-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,17Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7330-7334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have now used chemical cross-linking to examine the stoichiometry of complexes of different electrophoretic mobilities. In this experiment a HisΔOBP was cross-linked in solution using 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. A sample was then mixed with the radioactive oligonucleotide, PE17/18, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The cross-linked sample gave rise to multiple complexes with decreasing electrophoretic mobilities. The gel was cut in pieces to allow recovery of material corresponding to free DNA, complex II, and a more slowly migrating complex. Only a small amount of complex I was seen using the cross-linked sample, and it was not included in the further analysis. The samples were electroeluted and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis (Fig. 3). We found that the sample corresponding to complex II contained monomers and cross-linked dimers of HisΔOBP. More slowly migrating complexes contained in addition cross-linked trimers, tetramers, and so forth. We therefore conclude that complex II has a stoichiometry of two HisΔOBP monomers per DNA molecule and, by inference, complex I consists of one HisΔOBP per DNA molecule. Higher order complexes apparently seem to contain multiple protein monomers per DNA molecule. Several studies using mutated duplex oligonucleotide allow us to suggest a number of base-specific contacts between OBP and DNA (11Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. Naylor A.M. McClements W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24621-24626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition a methylation interference study clearly implicated four guanine residues as essential components of sequence-specific recognition (28Koff A. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4096-4103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have used oligonucleotides in which thymines and guanines were replaced with uracils and inosines to investigate whether contacts are made in the major or minor groove of DNA (Table I) (Figs. 4 and 5). The determination of binding constants from gel electrophoresis experiments demonstrated that all of the thymines in the recognition sequence GTTCGCAC contributed significantly to the overall binding energy (Fig. 4). Using the duplex oligonucleotide PE17/18d resulted in a reduction of the binding constant from 8 × 109m−1 to approximately 2.6 × 104m−1when all thymine residues were replaced with uracil (Fig. 4 a). Replacement of thymine with uracil outside this sequence had no effect on the binding constant. It is worth noting that complex II was still formed at high protein concentrations in the presence of PE17/18d and thus appears to reflect nonspecific interactions between HisΔOBP and DNA (Fig. 4 b). These observations confirm and extend a previous preliminary report suggesting the methyl groups of the thymine residues in box I are of significant importance for the interaction between OBP and oriS (29Focher, F., Verri, A., Verzeletti, S., Mazzarello, P., and Spadari, S. (1992) Chromosoma 102, Suppl. 1, S67–S71Google Scholar).Figure 5Replacing guanine with inosine does not abolish sequence-specific binding of HisΔOBP to DNA.Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of complexes between HisΔOBP and inosine-substituted duplex oligonucleotides as defined in Table I was performed in order to generate binding curves. The graphic representation describe the formation of complex I. The curves represent least square fits of the experimental results to the equilibrium equation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” (•——•) PE17/18, (▪——▪) PE17/18e.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a comparison a similar study was made using duplex oligonucleotides containing inosines instead of guanines (Fig. 5). The result was different. A duplex oligonucleotide, PE17/18e, in which all the guanines within the recognition sequence were replaced still allowed the formation of complex I. Although a reduction of the apparent binding constant was found, the magnitude of this effect was smaller and may in fact reflect a decreased stability of the duplex oligonucleotide rather than a loss of specific contacts between protein and DNA (Fig. 5). We therefore conclude that the energetically most important interactions as well as the sequence-specific contacts occur within the major groove of DNA. The binding of HisΔOBP to DNA is sensitive to the ionic strength (Table II). We have therefore tried to identify the contacts involving electrostatic interactions using an ethylation interference assay (26Wissman A. Hillen W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In order to facilitate the recovery of ethylated DNA from the experiment we developed a new strategy. HisΔOBP was immobilized on a nickel-Sepharose column. A restriction fragment containing oriS was partially ethylated and applied to the column. The column was washed and eluted by a stepwise increase in ionic strength (Fig. 6 a). The elution profile shows that a loosely bound form of DNA could be isolated by elution with 0.5m NaCl. A more tightly bound form of DNA was eluted at 2m NaCl. The eluted DNA was subjected to cleavage and analyzed on sequencing gels (Fig. 6 b). We found that loosely bound DNA, fractions 4 and 5, gave rise to a very limited number of bands. These bands corresponded to phosphates within box I and box II of oriS. A third group of bands is the result of an artifact in gel electrophoresis caused by a compression phenomenon in the GC-rich sequence upstream of box I. In the more tightly bound DNA, fractions 7 and 8, the intensities of the corresponding bands were significantly reduced. An analysis using the phosphorimager allowed us to identify these phosphate residues (Fig. 7). In box I the most important contacts were made with the two phosphates surrounding G23. In box II the most important phosphate was found between G64 and T65.Figure 7A PhosphorImager analysis identifies the essential phosphates that interact with HisΔOBP. The sequencing gels were from the experiment described in Fig. 6. The dotted curves show the result from a G + A cleavage reaction. Thethin solid line displays the cleavages in box I and box II in DNA derived from fraction 4 (free DNA). These cleavage sites are missing in fraction 7 (bold line, bound DNA) except for an adenine residue in box II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since box I and box II are symmetrically arranged in oriS the bands seen in the upper strand of box II in oriS correspond to the lower strand of box I. We therefore suggest that contacts between HisΔOBP and three phosphates, G23, T24, and T29, in the recognition sequence contributes significantly to the stability of the specific complex. These results are summarized in Fig. 8. In this communication we have tried to resolve conflicting interpretations regarding the stoichiometry of the specific complex formed between the C-terminal DNA binding domain of the HSV-1 origin binding protein, HisΔOBP, and its recognition sequence. To achieve this goal we have performed an extensive quantitative analysis of conditions that affect the binding of OBP to oriS. We have also identified contacts between HisΔOBP and the DNA backbone that appear to be essential for the binding of OBP to DNA. Finally, we have demonstrated quantitatively using uracil-substituted DNA that interactions with the major groove of DNA play a predominant role for the formation of a specific complex between HisΔOBP and its recognition sequence. Possibly, the methyl groups of thymine serve to exclude water from the interacting surfaces (30Lundbäck T. Härd T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4754-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We argue here on the basis of a cross-linking experiment that the specific complex between HisΔOBP and DNA has a stoichiometry of one protein monomer per recognition sequence. This complex, referred to as complex I, has a binding constant of 8 × 109m−1. Our interpretation agrees with previous results reporting that heterodimers cannot form on a single binding site (14Martin D.W. Muñoz R.M. Oliver D. Subler M.A. Deb S. Virology. 1994; 198: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We also identify a second complex, complex II, that is formed at high concentrations of protein and DNA. This complex contains two or more protein monomers per binding site. Interestingly, the conditions that in our hands support the formation of complex II closely resemble those of Fierer and Challberg (17Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7330-7334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) reporting a stoichiometry of two monomers per binding site. We suggest that the conflicting interpretations can be readily resolved if we assume that their report is concerned with complex II rather than complex I. The functional significance of complex II remains to be elucidated. Extensive studies using duplex oligonucleotides have demonstrated that all structural elements for high affinity binding of OBP to DNA resides within the sequence 5′- CGTTCGCACTT-3′ and its complementary strand. Quantitative analyses appear to further reduce this sequence to 5′- GTTCGCAC-3′ (11Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. Naylor A.M. McClements W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24621-24626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hammarsten O. Elias P. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We have noted that the methyl groups of thymine in this sequence are essential for high affinity binding. This clearly demonstrates that the major groove of DNA is the primary target for the sequence-specific binding of OBP to DNA. Studies with chemically modified DNA implicates that a base-specific contact is made with four guanines in the sequence GTTCGCAC (28Koff A. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4096-4103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using ethylation interference we now find that three phosphates on opposite sides of the major groove are contacted by OBP. Further information can be gained from a detailed analysis using mismatched substitutions of the recognition sequence (12Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. Naylor A.M. McClements W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24621-24626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The base sequence 5′-GTTCG-3′ of the upper strand and the base sequence 5′-GTG-3′ of the lower strand are essential for high affinity binding (12Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. Naylor A.M. McClements W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24621-24626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is evident from Fig. 8 that all the structural elements involved in the sequence-specific binding of OBP to DNA are located closely together in the major groove of DNA. Furthermore, the results suggest that the binding site is bipartite. One might speculate, for example, that one α helix of OBP might contact the upper strand and a second structural element the lower strand. It will now be of great interest to identify the amino acid residues in OBP that are responsible for sequence-specific recognition. A recent report shows that one lysine residue, Lys758, appears to be essential for binding (21Stow N.D. Brown G. Cross A.M. Abbotts A.P. Virology. 1998; 240: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). An extension of these studies might allow a complete identification of the amino acids that directly contact DNA. The HSV-1 origin binding protein is a member of the superfamily II of the DNA helicases (6Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 7Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 31Martinez R. Shao L. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6735-6746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic evidence allows the identification of the most highly conserved structural elements in DNA helicases (8Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 9Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). These are the two RecA-like domains and the seven helicase motifs. In the case of HSV-1 OBP a truncated protein consisting of the two RecA-like domains alone shows nonspecific helicase activity (5Abbotts A.P. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 3125-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The C-terminal DNA binding domain is essential for binding to oriS and appears to inhibit helicase activity on a model substrate in which the recognition sequence is provided with single-stranded tails in the appropriate orientation (20Lee S.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This inhibition is relieved by ICP-8, a single-strand DNA binding protein encoded by HSV-1. This observation argues that the DNA binding domain serves not as a passive anchor to DNA but that it may actively control the helicase activity. A detailed structural and functional understanding of HSV-1 OBP may thus not only contribute to our understanding of viral DNA replication but also elucidate important mechanisms common to the DNA helicases. We thank Anders Odén for invaluable assistance with the statistical analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2073025882,"Abstract The TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) family became widespread during evolution, having been found from bacteria to mammals. By means of restriction enzyme-mediated integration, we have identified a Dictyostelium gene (trfA) highly homologous to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding a TPR protein, Ssn6 (Cyc8), which functions as a global transcriptional repressor for diverse genes. The deduced amino acid sequence of theDictyostelium gene product, TRFA, contains 10 consecutive TPR units as well as Gln repeats, Asn repeats, and a region rich in Glu, Lys, Ser, and Thr. The sequences of some of the 10 TPR units in TRFA are more than 70% identical to the corresponding units in Ssn6. The trfA − cells produced smooth plaques on a bacterial lawn and failed to aggregate normally when starved on a plain agar plate. Individual trfA − cells also failed to correctly respond to cAMP, although the adenylyl cyclase oftrfA − cells was expressed upon starvation and activated by stimulation with cAMP as in the wild-type cells. When cultured in a rich medium in suspension, they grew more slowly and stopped growing at a lower density than the wild-type cells. Furthermore, they divided into cells of various sizes and tended to be much smaller than the wild-type cells. These pleiotropic defects of thetrfA − cells suggest the possibility thatDictyostelium TRFA may regulate the transcription of diverse genes required for normal growth and early development."
