https://openalex.org/W1644240647,"Geographic variation in some aspects of chimpanzee behavior has been interpreted as evidence for culture. Here we document similar geographic variation in orangutan behaviors. Moreover, as expected under a cultural interpretation, we find a correlation between geographic distance and cultural difference, a correlation between the abundance of opportunities for social learning and the size of the local cultural repertoire, and no effect of habitat on the content of culture. Hence, great-ape cultures exist, and may have done so for at least 14 million years."
https://openalex.org/W2002325846,"Although the parietal cortex has been implicated in the neural processes underlying visual attention, the nature of its contribution is not well understood. We tracked attention in the monkey and correlated the activity of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) with the monkey's attentional performance. The ensemble activity in LIP across the entire visual field describes the spatial and temporal dynamics of a monkey's attention. Activity subtending a single location in the visual field describes the attentional priority at that area but does not predict that the monkey will actually attend to or make an eye movement to that location."
https://openalex.org/W2062386682,"Neurogenesis occurs in the olfactory system of the adult brain throughout life, in both invertebrates and vertebrates, but its physiological regulation is not understood. We show that the production of neuronal progenitors is stimulated in the forebrain subventricular zone of female mice during pregnancy and that this effect is mediated by the hormone prolactin. The progenitors then migrate to produce new olfactory interneurons, a process likely to be important for maternal behavior, because olfactory discrimination is critical for recognition and rearing of offspring. Neurogenesis occurs even in females that mate with sterile males. These findings imply that forebrain olfactory neurogenesis may contribute to adaptive behaviors in mating and pregnancy."

The induced quantum coherence becomes vanishingly small in the high-temperature limit at which we operate and the heat bath is essentially thermal. However, the phase phi, associated with the atomic coherence, provides a new control parameter that can be varied to increase the temperature of the radiation field and to extract work from a single heat bath. The deep physics behind the second law of thermodynamics is not violated; nevertheless, the quantum Carnot engine has certain features that are not possible in a classical engine."
https://openalex.org/W2041358828,"Sex chromosomes are primary determinants of sexual dimorphism in many organisms. These chromosomes are thought to arise via the divergence of an ancestral autosome pair and are almost certainly influenced by differing selection in males and females. Exploring how sex chromosomes differ from autosomes is highly amenable to genomic analysis. We examined global gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster and report a dramatic underrepresentation of X-chromosome genes showing high relative expression in males. Using comparative genomics, we find that these same X-chromosome genes are exceptionally poorly conserved in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. These data indicate that the X chromosome is a disfavored location for genes selectively expressed in males."
https://openalex.org/W2166614212,"The pelagic larvae of many marine organisms can potentially disperse across hundreds of kilometers, but whether oceanographic or behavioral mechanisms can constrain dispersal over periods sufficient for the evolution of genetic differentiation remains unclear. Here, we concurrently examine larval duration and genetic population differentiation in a cleaner goby, Elacatinus evelynae, a member of the most species-rich genus of Caribbean reef fishes. Despite evidence for extended pelagic duration (21 days), populations of E. evelynae show strong genetic differentiation: among color forms (1.36 to 3.04% divergent at mitochondrial cytochrome b) and among island populations within color forms (Phi(ST) up to 70%). These results suggest that marine populations can remain demographically closed for thousands of generations despite extended larval duration, and that recognition cues such as color may promote speciation when geographic barriers are transient or weak."

These data allowed us to propose an energy landscape for a family of extremophilic enzymes based on the folding funnel model, integrating the main differences in conformational energy, cooperativity of protein unfolding, and temperature dependence of the activity. In particular, the shape of the funnel bottom, which depicts the stability of the native state ensemble, also accounts for the thermodynamic parameters of activation that characterize these extremophilic enzymes, therefore providing a rational basis for stability-activity relationships in protein adaptation to extreme temperatures.

Nevertheless, these peculiar biotopes have been successfully colonized by numerous organisms, mainly extremophilic bacteria and archaea. As the curiosity of scientists stimulates the exploration of new environments, it seems that there is no “empty space” for life on Earth and, for instance, even the supercooled cloud droplets contain actively growing bacteria (1Sattler B. Puxbaum H. Psenner R. Geophys. Res. Letters. 2001; 28: 239-242Google Scholar). Among the extremophilic microorganisms, those living at extreme temperatures have attracted much attention. Thermophiles have revealed the unsuspected upper temperature for life at about 113 °C (2Vieille C. Zeikus G.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 1-43Google Scholar, 3Blochl E. Rachel R. Burggraf S. Hafenbradl D. Jannasch H.W. Stetter K.O. Extremophiles. 1997; 1: 14-21Google Scholar). Their enzymes have also demonstrated a considerable biotechnological potential such as the various thermostable DNA polymerases used in PCR that have boosted many laboratory techniques. At the other end of the temperature scale, metabolically active psychrophilic bacteria have been detected in liquid brine veins of sea ice at −20 °C (4Deming J.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 301-309Google Scholar). These cold-loving microorganisms face the thermodynamic challenge to maintain enzyme-catalyzed reactions and metabolic rates compatible with sustained growth near or below the freezing point of pure water (5D'Amico S. Claverie P. Collins T. Georlette D. Gratia E. Hoyoux A. Meuwis M.A. Feller G. Gerday C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 917-925Google Scholar, 6Margesin R. Feller G. Gerday C. Russell N.J. Bitton G. Encyclopedia of Environmental Microbiology. 2. John Wiley and Sons, New York2002: 871-885Google Scholar). Directed evolution experiments have highlighted that, in theory, cold activity of enzymes can be gained by several subtle adjustments of the protein structure (7Wintrode P.L. Arnold F.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 55: 161-225Google Scholar). However, in natural cold environments, the consensus for the adaptive strategy is to take advantage of the lack of selective pressure for stable proteins for losing stability, therefore making the enzyme more mobile or flexible at temperatures that “freeze” molecular motions and reaction rates (8Feller G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; (in press): 59Google Scholar). The crystal structures of extremophilic enzymes unambiguously indicate a continuum in the molecular adaptations to temperature. There is indeed a clear increase in the number and strength of all known weak interactions and structural factors involved in protein stability from psychrophiles to mesophiles (living at intermediate temperatures close to 37 °C) and to thermophiles (2Vieille C. Zeikus G.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 1-43Google Scholar, 9Gianese G. Bossa F. Pascarella S. Proteins. 2002; 47: 236-249Google Scholar, 10Russell N.J. Extremophiles. 2000; 4: 83-90Google Scholar, 11Smalas A.O. Leiros H.K. Os V. Willassen N.P. Biotechnol. Annu. Rev. 2000; 6: 1-57Google Scholar). Therefore, the same mechanism of molecular adaptation is involved in response to two distinct selective pressures, i.e. the requirement for stable protein structure and activity in thermophiles and the requirement for high enzyme activity in psychrophiles. This of course suggests intricate relationships between activity and stability in naturally evolved enzymes from these extremophiles. To date, these relationships have not been investigated in details mainly because most extremophilic enzymes were not analyzed in rigorously identical conditions. In the present work, we have investigated three structurally homologous α-amylases. The α-amylase fromPseudoalteromonas haloplanktis(AHA),1 formerlyAlteromonas haloplanctis, is the best characterized psychrophilic enzyme isolated from an Antarctic bacterium (12Feller G. D'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Google Scholar, 13D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25791-25796Google Scholar, 14Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1503-1516Google Scholar). Interestingly, its closest structural homologue is the pig pancreatic α-amylase (PPA), which is taken here as the mesophilic reference (15D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 253: 95-105Google Scholar,16Qian M. Haser R. Buisson G. Duee E. Payan F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6284-6294Google Scholar). Bacillus species are able to colonize moderately thermophilic habitats, and Bacillus amyloliquefacienssecretes a thermostable α-amylase (BAA). This enzyme has been selected as the thermophilic counterpart because its unfolding is completed below 100 °C (17Fitter J. Heberle J. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1629-1636Google Scholar, 18Fitter J. Herrmann R. Dencher N.A. Blume A. Hauss T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10723-10731Google Scholar), therefore allowing biophysical investigations at atmospheric pressure. The three-dimensional structures of these α-amylases can be superimposed, showing a strong conservation of the active site architecture, of the main secondary structures, and of the overall fold (14Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1503-1516Google Scholar). However, the melting points of these proteins are markedly different: 45 °C for AHA, 65 °C for PPA, and 85 °C for BAA (12Feller G. D'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Google Scholar). Therefore, they constitute an adequate series of homologous enzymes for temperature adaptation studies. The recombinant AHA was expressed inEscherichia coli at 18 °C and purified by DEAE-agarose, Sephadex G-100, and Ultrogel AcA54 column chromatography, as described previously (13D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25791-25796Google Scholar). PPA and BAA were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Sigma, respectively. α-Amylase activity was recorded between 3 and 25 °C using 3.5 mm4-nitrophenyl-α-d-maltoheptaoside-4,6-O-ethylidene as substrate and excess α-glucosidase as coupling enzyme in 100 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, pH 7.2. Activities were recorded in a thermostated Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer (Kontron) and calculated on the basis of an absorption coefficient for 4-nitrophenol of 8,980m−1 cm−1 at 405 nm; a stoichiometric factor of 1.25 was applied (13D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25791-25796Google Scholar). Amylolytic activity recorded over a wide range of temperatures, up to 90 °C, was assayed by the dinitrosalicylic acid method (19Bernfeld P. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 149-151Google Scholar) using 1% soluble starch as substrate in 100 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. Heat inactivation of enzymes incubated in 100 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, was recorded as a function of time at various temperatures. The residual activity of timed aliquots stored in ice for 1 h was measured by the standard assay at 25 °C. Thermodynamic parameters of activation were calculated as described (20Lonhienne T. Gerday C. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 1-10Google Scholar) using EquationsEquation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, ΔG#=RT×lnkBTh−lnkEquation 1 ΔH#=Ea−RTEquation 2 ΔS#=(ΔH#−ΔG#)/TEquation 3 where k B is the Bolzmann constant,h the Planck constant, E a is the activation energy of the reaction, and R the gas constant. Fluorescence was recorded using an SML-AMINCO Model 8100 spectrofluorimeter (Spectronic Instruments) at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (1-nm band pass) and at an emission wavelength of 350 nm (4-nm band pass). Heat-induced unfolding was recorded in 100 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, at a scan rate of 1 °C/min using a programmed water bath Lauda Ecoline RE306. GdmCl-induced unfolding was monitored at 20 °C after a 4-h incubation of the samples at this temperature in 30 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2. Data were normalized using the pre- and post-transition baseline slopes as described (21Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Google Scholar). Least squares analysis of ΔG values as a function of GdmCl concentrations allowed the estimation of the conformational stability in the absence of denaturant,ΔG H 2O, according to Equation 4, ΔG=ΔGH2O−m[GdmCl]Equation 4 The biphasic transition of BAA was analyzed using a three-state model (22Grimsley J.K. Scholtz J.M. Pace C.N. Wild J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14366-14374Google Scholar). The acrylamide-dependent quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence was monitored in the presence of ∼50 μg of enzyme (A 280 <0.1) in a 1-ml initial volume of 30 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, pH 7.2, at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (1-nm band pass) and at an emission wavelength of 350 nm (2-nm band pass) after consecutive additions of 4 μl of 1.2 m acrylamide in the same buffer. The Stern-Volmer quenching constantsK SV were calculated according to the relation (23Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 257-301Google Scholar) shown in Equation 5, F/F0=1+KSV[Q]Equation 5 where F and F 0 are the fluorescence intensity in the presence and absence of molar concentration of the quencher Q, respectively. The intrinsic protein fluorescence F was corrected for the acrylamide inner filter effect f, the latter being defined as shown in Equation6,f=10−ɛ[Q]/2Equation 6 using an extinction coefficient ε for acrylamide at 280 nm of 4.3 m−1 cm−1. Measurements were performed using a MicroCal MCS-DSC instrument as detailed (12Feller G. D'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Google Scholar). Samples (∼3 mg/ml) were dialyzed overnight against 30 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2. Thermograms of enzyme-acarbose complexes were recorded in the presence of 1 mm acarbose (Bayer). Thermograms were analyzed according to a non-two-state model in which the melting pointT m, the calorimetric enthalpyΔH cal, and the van't Hoff enthalpyΔH eff of individual transitions are fitted independently using the MicroCal Origin software (version 2.9). The magnitude and source of the errors in theT m and enthalpy values have been discussed elsewhere (24Matouschek A. Matthews J.M. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1089-1095Google Scholar). Fitting standard errors on a series of three DSC measurements made under the same conditions in the present study were found to be ±0.05 K on T m and ±1% on both enthalpies. Thermograms for equilibrium unfolding were recorded at 2 K min−1 and in the presence of 0.5m 3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate for PPA and BAA. The thermodynamic parameters of unfolding were calculated using the relations (25Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Google Scholar) shown in Equations Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9, ΔG(T)=ΔHcal(1−T/Tm)+ΔCp(T−Tm)−TΔCpln(T/Tm)Equation 7 ΔH(T)=ΔHm+ΔCp(T−Tm)Equation 8 ΔS(T)=ΔHm/Tm+ΔCpln(T/Tm)Equation 9 with a heat capacity difference between the native and unfolded state ΔCp = 8.47 kcal mol−1K−1 as determined experimentally (12Feller G. D'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Google Scholar). Kinetically driven unfolding was recorded at low scan rates (0.1, 0.5, and 1 K min−1), and the rate constant k was calculated from the relation (26Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1652Google Scholar) shown in Equation 10,k=vCp/Δcal−Δ(T)Equation 10 where v is the scan rate,C p is the excess heat capacity at a temperature T, Δcal is the total heat of the process, and Δ(T) is the heat evolved at a given temperature T. The stability of AHA, PPA, and BAA is illustrated in Fig. 1 by their GdmCl-induced unfolding transitions. These enzymes unfold at distinct denaturant concentrations (C 12) and are characterized by a decrease of unfolding cooperativity (mvalue) and the appearance of intermediate states (BAA) as the stability increases. These observations parallel the behavior of protein adapted to different temperatures as recorded by thermal unfolding (12Feller G. D'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Google Scholar, 13D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25791-25796Google Scholar). Estimation of the conformational stability in the absence of denaturant (ΔG H 2O) at 20 °C using Equation 4 provides a ratio of 1/2/6 for AHA, PPA, and BAA, respectively. The stability curves of the investigated enzymes have been calculated from DSC data using the modified Gibbs-Helmholtz equation (Equation 7). This function corresponds to the energy required to disrupt the native state at any temperature (27Privalov P. Creighton T. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 83-126Google Scholar) and by definition is nil at the melting point (Fig. 2). The psychrophilic AHA unfolds reversibly according to a two-state mechanism, and the validity of its stability curve has been demonstrated by detection of the cold melting point predicted by the function (12Feller G. D'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Google Scholar). The poorly reversible thermal unfolding of PPA and BAA was analyzed according to the model of Lumry and Eyring, shown in Equation 11,Figure 2Gibbs free energy of unfolding.Stability curves are shown for the psychrophilic AHA, the mesophilic PPA, and the thermophilic BAA, as calculated from microcalorimetric data (Equation 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) NU→1Equation 11 using DSC data generated at fast scan rates (2 K/min) in the presence of a non-detergent sulfobetaine to prevent aggregation (28Vuillard L. Braun-Breton C. Rabilloud T. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 337-343Google Scholar). In these conditions, it is assumed that the irreversible step has much lower enthalpy contribution and rate constant than the reversible step. As a result, the unfolding transition can be regarded to a first approximation as an equilibrium transition and can be treated by the equations of equilibrium thermodynamics (29Privalov P.L. Medved L.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 159: 665-683Google Scholar, 30Vogl T. Jatzke C. Hinz H.J. Benz J. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1657-1668Google Scholar). Some general conclusions concerning the stability of extremophilic enzymes can be deduced from these curves. Despite large differences in melting pointT m, the ΔG maxvalues (top of the curve) are centered around room temperature, as anticipated from theoretical studies (31Kumar S. Tsai C.J. Nussinov R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5359-5374Google Scholar). Accordingly, the increasing melting points of the three enzymes are predominantly reached by lifting the stability curves. This is obtained by a corresponding increase of ΔH cal in Equation 7(at constant ΔCp), demonstrating the major involvement of enthalpic stabilization of the protein structure in temperature adaptation (32Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1995; 47: 307-425Google Scholar, 33Kumar S. Tsai C.J. Nussinov R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14152-14165Google Scholar). Furthermore, the analysis of these curves indicates that the heat-labile psychrophilic enzyme is also cold-labile, contrary to what is intuitively expected, whereas the heat-stable BAA is predicted to be the most cold-stable protein. The enthalpic and entropic contributions to ΔG have been calculated according to Equations 8 and 9 (TableI). The physiological temperatures for the heat-stable PPA and BAA lie on the right side of the bell-shaped ΔG curves, and therefore, their structure is stabilized enthalpically, whereas the thermal dissipative contribution of the unfavorable entropic term provides the required mobility for the enzyme function (25Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Google Scholar). In contrast, the physiological low temperatures for the psychrophilic enzyme lie on the left side of its stability curve. It follows that in environmental conditions, its structure is stabilized entropically, whereas the enthalpic contribution becomes a destabilizing factor. It is thought that hydration of polar and nonpolar groups is responsible for the decrease of stability at low temperatures, leading to cold unfolding (32Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1995; 47: 307-425Google Scholar, 34Privalov P.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 281-305Google Scholar), and accordingly, this factor should contribute to the required mobility for function at environmental low temperatures.Table IEnthalpic and entropic contributions to conformational stability at relevant temperaturesα-amylaseAt 0 °CAtT maxAt 37 °CΔGΔHTΔST maxΔG= ΔHΔGΔHTΔSkcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1°Ckcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1AHA2.5−158.8−161.3208.34.1154.7150.6PPA5.9−235.5−241.43017.116.076.560.5BAA21.7−239.0−260.73337.036.774.437.7 Open table in a new tab Heat inactivation of activity was analyzed according to the kinetic model shown in Equation 12, N→kIEquation 12 and the activation parameters were calculated from Arrhenius plots. The irreversible conformational unfolding of PPA and BAA was analyzed from DSC data generated at low scan rates (<1 K/min). Such kinetic analysis is not possible for AHA (fully reversible unfolding), and data were obtained from its mutant N12R. The latter displays the same microcalorimetric properties as AHA but only 30% denaturation reversibility (13D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25791-25796Google Scholar), ensuring that unfolding is kinetically driven. As a matter of fact, the melting point of the three enzymes is scan rate-dependent below 1 K/min, and the rate constantk was calculated from Equation 10. The corresponding activation parameters are provided in TableII, which shows that both heat inactivation of activity and irreversible unfolding of the structure display the same trends. The increase in free energy of activation from AHA to BAA reflects that the same denaturation rate constantsk are reached at increasing temperatures (44, 60, and 80 °C for heat inactivation of AHA, PPA, and BAA, respectively). The small differences in ΔG*, however, arise from large differences in the enthalpic and entropic contributions. Indeed, the lowest ΔG* value for the psychrophilic enzyme corresponds to the largest ΔH* and TΔS* contributions and conversely corresponds to the heat-stable BAA. The decrease of ΔH* as enzyme stability increases mainly reflects the decrease in cooperativity of inactivation and of unfolding: for instance, the heat-labile AHA denatures in a shorter temperature range, leading to the sharp slope of the Arrhenius plots and subsequently to high activation energy Ea and ΔH*. Such high cooperativity probably originates from the lower number of interactions required to disrupt the active conformation. In this formalism, ΔS* >0 suggests that the randomness of the activated transition state increases before irreversible inactivation or unfolding. Accordingly, the transition state of the psychrophilic enzyme is reached through a larger entropy variation than that of BAA, possibly reflecting an increased disorder (of the active site or of the structure), which is the main driving force of heat denaturation. In addition, the thermophilic enzyme seems resistant to denaturation before the irreversible loss of activity and conformation (low ΔS*). A thermophilic enzyme can then be regarded as an intrinsically stable protein that counteracts heat denaturation by a weak cooperativity of unfolding and inactivation. The entropy loss associated with hydration of nonpolar groups upon denaturation can also contribute to the differences in entropic contribution reported in Table II. In the case of unfolding, this is supported by the slight increase of hydrophobicity from AHA to BAA noted for these enzymes (12Feller G. D'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Google Scholar).Table IIThermodynamic parameters for the irreversible heat inactivation of activity and for irreversible unfoldingInactivationUnfoldingΔG*ΔH*TΔS*ΔS*ΔG*ΔH*TΔS*ΔS*kcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1cal mol−1K−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1cal mol−1K−1AHA20.5172.3151.847920.2109.789.2286PPA21.5153.0131.539521.584.763.2190BAA22.958.635.710122.974.251.3145As the three enzymes are denatured in different temperature ranges, activation data are reported for an identical rate constant,k = 0.05 s−1.

Thermal unfolding data for AHA were obtained with the mutant N12R. It is generally assumed that the increase in stability from psychrophilic to thermophilic proteins arises from a decrease in conformational flexibility (5D'Amico S. Claverie P. Collins T.

A. 2000; 97: 2962-2964Google Scholar). The conformational flexibility of the three investigated enzymes was probed by dynamic fluorescence quenching. Briefly, this technique utilizes increasing concentrations of a small quencher molecule (acrylamide in the present case) to probe the accessibility of tryptophane within a protein. The decrease of fluorescence arising from diffusive collisions between the quencher and the fluorophore reflects the ability of the quencher to penetrate the structure and can be viewed as an index of protein permeability (23Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 257-301Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.3, this index significantly decreases from AHA to BAA (at 10 and 37 °C) and is inversely correlated with stability: the higher the stability, the lower the permeability. However, absolute values of the Stern-Volmer quenching constant (K SV) can be compared only if the location of tryptophane residues in the structure is identical as well as their environment. This condition cannot be met for most closely related protein homologues (12, 19, and 17 Trp residues for AHA, PPA, and BAA, respectively), and therefore, the variation of these constants with temperature becomes the relevant parameter. Again, Fig. 3 shows that the variation of fluorescence quenching between 10 and 37 °C decreases in the order psychrophile → mesophile → thermophile. A similar variation was obtained between 10 and 25 °C (data not shown). Thus, the increase in protein permeability in a temperature range where the native state prevails is much larger for AHA, intermediate for PPA, and low for BAA. It should be noted that this permeability is the result of all conformational opening processes, averaged in a large time scale, allowing the quencher to diffuse into the protein. These data strongly support a correlation between stability and conformational flexibility. It has been shown that the high activity at low temperatures of cold-adapted enzymes (corresponding to the low activation free energy ΔG* of the reaction) mainly arises from low values of the activation enthalpy that render enzymatic reactions less temperature-dependent (42Low P.S. Bada J.L. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 430-432Google Scholar, 43Fields P.A. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11476-11481Google Scholar). This is illustrated in TableIII by the activation parameters of the three investigated enzymes. It has been further proposed that this property reflects the weak number of enthalpy-driven interactions that have to be broken to reach the transition state, leading to a heat-labile activity as these interactions also contribute to the active site conformation (20Lonhienne T. Gerday C. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 1-10Google Scholar). As a first experimental approach, the thermodependence of the activity and the thermally induced unfolding transition were recorded in the same conditions, as shown in Fig.4, in the absence of added Ca2+, which stabilizes the structure (12Feller G. D'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Google Scholar) but inhibits the activity (44Boel E. Brady L. Brzozowski A.M. Derewenda Z. Dodson G.G. Jensen V.J. Petersen S.B. Swift H. Thim L. Woldike H.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6244-6249Google Scholar). In the case of the heat-stable PPA and BAA, the temperature for maximal activity closely corresponds to the fluorescence transition, showing that structural unfolding is a main determinant for the loss of activity at high temperatures. In contrast, the maximal activity of the psychrophilic enzyme is reached at about 30 °C, below any significant conformational event (Fig. 4). This shows that the active site of the psychrophilic enzyme (and the catalytic intermediates) is even more heat-labile than its protein structure. Such a result supports the concept of “localized flexibility” (43Fields P.A. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11476-11481Google Scholar), which assumes that the low stability of the active site or of the structures bearing the active site is a main determinant of activity at low temperatures.Table IIIActivation parameters of the amylolytic reaction at 10 °Cα-amylasek catEaΔG*ΔH*TΔS*s−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1AHA2948.913.88.3−5.5PPA9711.714.011.1−2.9BAA1417.415.016.81.8 Open table in a new tab Table III also indicates that the magnitude of the entropic term of the enzymatic reaction decreases as the enzyme stability increases. It has been hypothesized that the flexible and mobile active site of psychrophilic enzymes undergoes larger structural fluctuations between the free and activated states than the more compact and rigid catalytic center of stable enzymes (20Lonhienne T. Gerday C. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 1-10Google Scholar, 43Fields P.A. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11476-11481Google Scholar). If this is true, and on the basis of the activation entropy (Table III), AHA trapped in the activated state should display larger structural differences with the free enzyme, PPA should display intermediate differences, and BAA should display minimal structural differences. To check this hypothesis, the stability of the three enzymes was recorded by DSC in the free state and in complex with acarbose, a large pseudosaccharide inhibitor acting as a transition state analog (16Qian M. Haser R. Buisson G. Duee E. Payan F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6284-6294Google Scholar). Fig. 5 and Table IVreveal that upon acarbose binding, the psychrophilic enzyme is indeed strongly stabilized, as indicated by the large increases of the melting point and of the calorimetric enthalpy ΔH cal. According to the same criterion, PPA is less stabilized in the transition state, whereas BAA is destabilized, as shown by the lower ΔH cal value without melting point alteration. It is worth mentioning that both the magnitude and sign of these variations, as well as the macroscopic interpretation (assuming that a stabilized transition state intermediate is more ordered), parallels the structural fluctuations predicted by the activation entropy (TableIII). These data strongly suggest that the improved activity at low temperatures of the psychrophilic enzyme is achieved by destabilizing the active site domain to reduce the temperature dependence of the activity (low ΔH*), which in turn implies large structural motions upon substrate binding (high ΔS*). The low activity of thermophilic enzymes at room temperature can be explained in the same way. The catalytic domain designed to be active at high temperature is stabilized by numerous interactions, resulting in a higher temperature dependence (high ΔH*, and therefore, a low activity as the temperature decreases), whereas the moderate conformational changes of the rigid active site result in weak activation entropy variations.Table IVMicrocalorimetric parameters of thermal unfolding for α-amylases in the free state and in complex with the pseudosaccharide inhibitor acarboseα-amylaseFree enzymeEnzyme-acarbose complexΔT maxΔΔH calT maxΔH calT maxΔH cal° Ckcal mol−1°Ckcal mol−1° Ckcal mol−1AHA44.021460.630416.690PPA65.629581.930616.311BAA85.742785.73470.0−80 Open table in a new tab These results and available data on enzymes adapted to extreme temperatures can be integrated in a model based on the “new view” using the folding funnel to describe the folding-unfolding reactions (45Dill K.A. Chan H.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 10-19Google Scholar, 46Dobson C.M. Karplus M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 92-101Google Scholar, 47Dinner A.R. Sali A. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M. Karplus M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 331-339Google Scholar, 48Schultz C.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 7-10Google Scholar). Fig.6 describes the energy landscape of psychrophilic and thermophilic enzymes. The height of the funnel,i.e. the free energy of folding, also corresponding to the conformational stability, can be fixed in a 1/5 ratio according to the stability curves (Fig. 1, Table I). The upper edge of the funnels is occupied by the unfolded state in random coil conformations. It should be noted that psychrophilic enzymes tend to have a lower proline content than mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes, a lower number of disulfide bonds, and a higher occurrence of glycine clusters (8Feller G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; (in press): 59Google Scholar, 9Gianese G. Bossa F. Pascarella S. Proteins. 2002; 47: 236-249Google Scholar, 10Russell N.J.

Accordingly, the edge of the funnel for the psychrophilic protein is slightly larger (broader distribution of the unfolded state) and is located at a higher energy level. When the polypeptide is allowed to fold, the free energy level decreases, as well as the conformational ensemble. However, thermophilic proteins pass through intermediate states corresponding to local minima of energy. These minima are responsible for the ruggedness of the funnel slopes and for the reduced cooperativity of the folding-unfolding reaction as demonstrated by GdmCl and heat-induced unfolding. In contrast, the structural elements of psychrophilic proteins generally unfold cooperatively without intermediates, as a result of fewer stabilizing interactions and stability domains (12Feller G. D'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Google Scholar, 13D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25791-25796Google Scholar), and therefore, the funnel slopes are steep and smooth. The bottom of the funnel, which depicts the stability of the native state ensemble, also displays significant differences between both extremozymes. The bottom for a very stable and rigid thermophilic protein can be depicted as a single global minimum or as having only a few minima with high energy barriers between them (49Tsai C.J. Ma B. Nussinov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9970-9972Google Scholar,50Kumar S. Ma B. Tsai C.J. Sinha N. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 10-19Google Scholar), whereas the bottom for an unstable and flexible psychrophilic protein is rugged and depicts a large population of conformers with low energy barriers to flip between them. Rigidity of the native state is therefore a direct function of the energy barrier height (49Tsai C.J. Ma B. Nussinov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9970-9972Google Scholar, 50Kumar S. Ma B. Tsai C.J. Sinha N. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 10-19Google Scholar) and is drawn here according to the results of fluorescence quenching. In this context, the activity-stability relationships in these extremozymes depend on the bottom properties. Indeed, it has been argued that upon substrate binding to the association-competent subpopulation, the equilibrium between all conformers is shifted toward this subpopulation, leading to the active conformational ensemble (49Tsai C.J. Ma B. Nussinov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9970-9972Google Scholar, 50Kumar S. Ma B. Tsai C.J. Sinha N. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 10-19Google Scholar, 51Ma B. Kumar S. Tsai C.J. Hu Z. Nussinov R. J. Theor. Biol. 2000; 203: 383-397Google Scholar). In the case of the rugged bottom of psychrophilic enzymes, this equilibrium shift only requires a modest free energy change (low energy barriers), a low enthalpy change for interconversion of the conformations, but is accompanied by a large entropy change for fluctuations between the wide conformer ensemble. The converse picture holds for thermophilic enzymes, in agreement with the activation parameters (Table III) and with the proposed macroscopic interpretation. Such energy landscapes integrate nearly all biochemical and biophysical data from extremophilic enzymes, but they will certainly be refined when other series of homologous proteins from psychrophiles, mesophiles, and thermophiles will become available."

We found that the yeast mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase scaffold Ste5 is tolerant to major stereochemical perturbations; heterologous protein interactions could functionally replace native kinase recruitment interactions, indicating that simple tethering is largely sufficient for scaffold-mediated signaling. Moreover, by engineering a scaffold that tethers a unique kinase set, we could create a synthetic MAP kinase pathway with non-natural input-output properties.

https://openalex.org/W2084204714,"High-harmonic generation is a well-known method of producing coherent extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) light, with photon energies up to about 0.5 keV (refs 1, 2). This is achieved by focusing a femtosecond laser into a gas, and high harmonics of the fundamental laser frequency are radiated in the forward direction. However, although this process can generate high-energy photons, efficient high-harmonic generation has been demonstrated only for photon energies of the order 50-100 eV (ref. 5). Ionization of the gas prevents the laser and the EUV light from propagating at the same speed, which severely limits the conversion efficiency. Here we report a technique to overcome this problem, and demonstrate quasi-phase-matched frequency conversion of laser light into EUV. Using a modulated hollow-core waveguide to periodically vary the intensity of the laser light driving the conversion, we efficiently generate EUV light even in the presence of substantial ionization. The use of a modulated fibre shifts the energy spectrum of the high-harmonic light to significantly higher photon energies than would otherwise be possible. We expect that this technique could form the basis of coherent EUV sources for advanced lithography and high-resolution imaging applications. In future work, it might also be possible to generate isolated attosecond pulses."

HO-1 is induced by its substrate heme and various environmental factors, which represents a protective response against oxidative stresses. Here we show that hypoxia represses HO-1 expression in three human cell types but induces it in rat, bovine, and monkey cells, indicating the inter-species difference in the hypoxic regulation of HO-1 expression. The hypoxia-mediated repression of HO-1 expression is consistently associated with the induction of Bach1, a heme-regulated transcriptional repressor, in human cells. Bach1 is a basic leucine zipper protein, forming a heterodimer with a small Maf protein. Expression of HO-1 was also reduced in human cells when exposed to interferon-γ or an iron chelator desferrioxamine, each of which induced Bach1 expression. In contrast, induction of HO-1 expression by CoCl2 is associated with reduced expression of Bach1 mRNA. Thus, expression of HO-1 and Bach1 is inversely regulated. We have identified a Maf recognition element in the human HO-1gene that is required for repression of a reporter gene by hypoxia and targeted by Bach1. Therefore, Bach1 functions as a hypoxia-inducible repressor for the HO-1 gene, thereby contributing to fine-tuning of oxygen homeostasis in human cells."

Chem. 1994; 269: 14254-14259Google Scholar). SIs in related bacteria exhibit somewhat greater variability than the sequences of full-length ॆ and ॆ′ (e.g. SIs are ∼707 conserved betweenEscherichia coli and Hemophilus influenzae and ∼607 conserved between E. coli and Shewanella violacea, whereas the remaining parts of ॆ and ॆ′ are ∼85 and ∼807 conserved between the two pairs, respectively). Nonetheless, their retention in distinct bacteria with significant sequence conservation suggests that they play some functional role. One role could be the recruitment of cellular regulatory proteins. For instance, ॆSI1 appears to be the target of the phage T4 Alc termination factor (15Severinov K. Kashlev M. Severinova E. Bass I. McWilliams K. Kutter E. Nikiforov V. Snyder L. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14254-14259Google Scholar). SI modules could also affect biochemical properties of RNAP more directly; both ॆ′SI3 and ॆSI1 are proposed to make downstream DNA contacts that explain the greater stability and longer downstream footprints of E. coli RNAP open complexes (relative to, for instance, Bacillus subtilis RNAP) (7Severinov K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 118-125Google Scholar, 16Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Malhotra A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Science. 2000; 289: 619-625Google Scholar).We became interested in the sequence insertions in proteobacterial RNAP as possible explanations for the inability of B. subtilisRNAP to recognize hairpin-dependent pause signals as well as the decreased open complex longevity and decreased abortive initiation of B. subtilis RNAP (17Artsimovitch I. Svetlov V. Anthony L. Burgess R.R. Landick R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6027-6035Google Scholar). To facilitate study of RNAPs with precise SI deletions, we developed a polycistronic co-overexpression system for E. coli RNAP that relies on T7 RNAP-dependent transcription of all three core RNAP subunit genes (rpoA, rpoB, and rpoC) on a single plasmid. To facilitate purification of the recombinant RNAPs, we appended an intein-chitin-binding protein (CBP) module to the ॆ′ C terminus and a hexahistidine-hemagglutinin tag to the N terminus of ॆ. This system allowed us to purify and test precise deletions of all three SIs in E. coli RNAP and provides a generally useful method for the study of mutant E. coli RNAP enzymes that avoids the loss of activity and assembly problems that sometimes arise with in vitro reconstitution methods (18Zillig W. Hidvegi E. Hidvegi E.J. Sumegi J. Venetianer P. Biochemistry of the Cell Nucleus. 33. North-Holland, Amsterdam1975: 239-251Google Scholar,19Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe have described a co-overexpression system for mutantE. coli RNAPs and its use to investigate whether sequence insertions in the ॆ and ॆ′ subunits could explain the different initiation and elongation properties of E. coliRNAP compared with B. subtilis RNAP, which lacks these insertions. We found that co-overexpression facilitates assembly of otherwise difficult to assemble or toxic mutant RNAPs and that the sequence insertions, most notably ॆ′SI3, confer some of its distinctive biochemical properties on E. coli RNAP and partially account for its differences from B. subtilis RNAP. We will discuss the implications of these findings for the study of mutant RNAPs, the function of the E. coli sequence insertions with focus on ॆ′SI3, and the evolution of sequence insertions in RNAP.An RNAP Overexpression System That Promotes Efficient AssemblyPrevious studies of toxic RNAP mutants have relied either on conditional expression of a tagged mutant subunit followed by tag affinity separation from wild type RNAP (or tagging and removal of the wild type enzyme from the RNAP preparation) (40Weilbaecher R. Hebron C. Feng G. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2913-2917Google Scholar) or in vitro reconstitution of RNAP by gradual renaturation of mixtures of the denatured subunits (19Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Google Scholar, 41Palm P. Heil A. Boyd D. Grampp B. Zillig W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 283-291Google Scholar, 42Zalenskaya K. Lee J. Gujuluva C.N. Shin Y.K. Slutsky M. Goldfarb A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 7-12Google Scholar, 43Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 503-511Google Scholar). ॆ′ΔSI3 illustrates the limitation of these approaches. When expressed as an individual subunitin vivo, ॆ′ΔSI3 fails to out-compete wild type ॆ′ for assembly into useful amounts of mutant enzyme; when used in in vitro reconstitution protocols, it fails to assemble into RNAP (see 舠Results舡 and Ref. 14Zakharova N. Bass I. Arsenieva E. Nikiforov V. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24912-24920Google Scholar).Co-overexpression of wild type and mutant tagged subunits solved these problems for ॆ′ΔSI3 and has allowed us to isolate substantial quantities of many mutant RNAPs, including notably toxic mutants such as the ॆΔ(900–909) flap mutant RNAP (37Toulokhonov I. Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Science. 2001; 292: 730-733Google Scholar). Thus, the co-overexpression plasmid provides a powerful tool for genetic and biochemical analysis of RNAP. The resulting enzymes are substantially pure after two steps, primarily because chitin affinity chromatography is much more selective than the hexahistidine-Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose method that has been widely used to date (44Kashlev M. Nudler E. Severinov K. Borukhov S. Komissarova N. Goldfarb A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 326-334Google Scholar), and has the advantage of being assembled by the normal pathway in vivo. We anticipate that the co-overexpression plasmid will also prove useful for selection of RNAP suppressor mutants of inviable amino acid substitutions in the enzyme. Finally, because RNAP is pure enough for in vitrotranscription assays after just the single chitin column step, the method should facilitate rapid screening of sets of closely related alterations to RNAP.In using the co-overexpression method for mutant RNAP assembly and purification, we encountered a few problems that require care to avoid. First, the chitin matrix apparently can break down when batch binding and elution are used, which prevents retention of the tagged enzyme on the solid chitin matrix. We used slow passage of lysates through a column of chitin matrix to avoid this problem. Second, the efficiency of DTT-mediated cleavage of the Sce VMA intein that connects ॆ′ to the CBP was usually less than 1007, and both the binding capacity and the cleavage efficiency appeared to vary among lots of chitin matrix. It is advisable to test new batches of matrix before committing valuable samples; some loss of material due to inefficient cleavage appears unavoidable. Third, we sometimes observed loss of expression of one or more of the RNAP subunits when the co-expression plasmid was maintained in recA+, T7 RNAP-expressing strains, apparently due to plasmid rearrangements, mutations, or recombination with the chromosomal copies ofrpoA, rpoB, or rpoC. The last problem was substantially eliminated by maintaining the plasmids inrecA strains such as DH5α except during expression. Finally, we emphasize that not all RNAP mutants can be successfully recovered by the co-overexpression approach. For instance, a deletion slightly larger than ॆ′ΔSI3 (Δ932–1137 versusΔ943–1130 in ॆ′ΔSI3) failed to assemble and yielded only insoluble ॆ′Δ(932–1137) aggregates in vivo.Role of ॆ′SI3 in RNAP FunctionAlthough both SI1 and SI2 in ॆ exhibited some effects on the biochemical properties of RNAP (and were essential for full viability in vivo), the most dramatic effects on RNAP properties were observed for ॆ′SI3. ॆ′SI3 profoundly affected initiation and pausing by E. coli RNAP, in both cases accounting for many but not all of its differences fromB. subtilis RNAP. We will consider the effects on initiation and pausing separately, although the underlying changes in RNAP's properties could be related.ॆ′SI3 stabilized open complexes formed at the T7 A1 promoter against disruption by heparin. This stabilization could reflect either direct contact with the downstream DNA, as previously proposed (16Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Malhotra A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Science. 2000; 289: 619-625Google Scholar), or it could reflect indirect stabilization of the open complex if folding of ॆ′SI3 is coupled to structural transitions in RNAP that occur upon open complex formation. Although direct DNA interaction is an attractive hypothesis, no cross-linking studies to date unambiguously document interaction of ॆ′SI3 with the downstream DNA in open complexes. In the recently published crystal structure of T. thermophilis RNAP, the loop in ॆ′G to which ॆ′SI3 connects is positioned near the downstream DNA channel (11Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Google Scholar), also favoring its possible interaction with downstream DNA. However, this structure is of an enzyme that lacks ॆ′SI3 and was obtained in the absence of DNA. The ॆ′G loop is poorly ordered in both the yeast RNAPII and T. aquaticus RNAP crystal structures and was found in different conformations in the ordered portions of the two structures, suggesting that it is capable of significant motion. Further, ॆ′SI3 itself is not visible in a recent electron microscopy crystal structure ofE. coli RNAP, suggesting that it is even more mobile than the ॆ′G loop (10Darst S.A. Opalka N. Chacon P. Polyakov A. Richter C. Zhang G. Wriggers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4296-4301Google Scholar). Thus, ॆ′SI3 folding could be coupled either directly or indirectly to interactions of RNAP with downstream DNA. Many DNA-binding proteins undergo folding transitions in protein segments distant from the actual DNA binding surface (45Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Google Scholar). These indirect but coupled protein folding events are thought to contribute significantly to the avidity of protein-DNA interactions. Thus, stabilization of open complexes by ॆ′SI3 could arise not via its direct interaction with the downstream DNA but via an indirect coupling of its folding to open complex formation. Further study will be required to distinguish these possibilities.Both the direct and indirect explanation of ॆ′SI3 function also could apply to its effect on transcriptional pausing. Both formation of paused transcription elongation complexes and their slow escape are enhanced by an interaction of downstream DNA with RNAP (46LaFlamme S.E. Kramer F.R. Mills D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8425-8440Google Scholar, 47Lee D.N. Phung L. Stewart J. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15145-15153Google Scholar, 48Chan C. Wang D. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 54-68Google Scholar, 49Ederth J. Artsimovitch I. Isaksson L. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37456-37463Google Scholar). Thus, ॆ′SI3 could strengthen the pause-enhancing downstream DNA interaction either directly or by the indirect mechanism described above. Interestingly, the effects on pausing of deleting ॆ′SI3 are quite similar to the effects of deleting the ॆ′ jaw domain ofE. coli RNAP, for which a variety of data suggest a direct DNA interaction (49Ederth J. Artsimovitch I. Isaksson L. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37456-37463Google Scholar).In the case of pausing, however, a third explanation is possible. ॆ′G, in which ॆ′SI3 is inserted, appears to cross-link to the RNA 3′ nt in the his paused transcription complex 3K. Toulokhonov and R. Landick, unpublished results. as well as to the RNA 3′ nt in arrested complexes (50Markovtsov V. Mustaev A. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3221-3226Google Scholar) and in certain artificial transcription complexes that may mimic paused transcription complexes (51Epshtein V. Mustaev A. Markovtsov V. Bereshchenko O. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 623-634Google Scholar). Further, amino acid substitutions in ॆ′G, near the site of ॆ′SI3 insertion, strongly affect chain elongation and transcriptional pausing and termination (40Weilbaecher R. Hebron C. Feng G. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2913-2917Google Scholar, 51Epshtein V. Mustaev A. Markovtsov V. Bereshchenko O. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 623-634Google Scholar). If movements of the ॆ′G loop are involved in transcriptional pausing, it could readily explain why deletion of ॆ′SI3 has such a strong effect on pausing. This also might explain why a partial deletion in ॆ′SI3 (Δ1091–1130) as well as monoclonal antibody binding to ॆ′1091–1130 in wild type RNAP greatly increase pausing (14Zakharova N. Bass I. Arsenieva E. Nikiforov V. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24912-24920Google Scholar), whereas complete deletion of ॆ′SI3 (Δ943–1130) decreases pausing (Figs. 4 and 5). By altering the structure of ॆ′SI3, both ॆ′Δ(1091–1130) and antibody binding could interfere with movements of the ॆ′G loop necessary for rapid nucleotide addition, whereas removal of ॆ′SI3 could favor such movements.Roles of ॆSI1 and ॆSI2 in Abortive InitiationॆSI1 and ॆSI2 both exhibited effects on initiation complexes, either in open complex longevity, abortive initiation, or both. Interestingly, both SIs increased abortive initiation significantly, although they decreased open complex longevity modestly (ॆSI1) or had no effect on it (ॆSI2). This suggests that RNAP must be exceptionally sensitive to changes in its structure during abortive initiation. This could be related to the sequential rearrangements of contacts between core RNAP and ς that are thought to occur during the initial stages of RNA synthesis (52Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1285-1290Google Scholar). Perhaps ॆSI1 and ॆSI2 somehow facilitate the core-ς rearrangement during initial transcript synthesis. Alternatively, they could indirectly affect the conformation of the main channel of RNAP such that their removal increases the rate of abortive transcript release.Sequence Insertions Are Ubiquitous in Bacterial RNAPsFinally, we note that sequence insertions are not limited to those found in the RNAPs from enteric and thermophilic bacteria. A search of sequences now available for ॆ and ॆ′ subunits in bacteria revealed that sequence insertions are ubiquitous and that the positions of these insertions are not restricted to those observed in the enteric and thermophilic bacteria (Figs. 1 and6). Rather, the sequence insertions differ in size, sequence, and location but are predicted to be surface-exposed (Fig. 6). Such a distribution of sequence insertions is consistent with the idea that they confer species-specific properties on core RNAP, either by modulating its enzymatic activity directly or through interactions with transcription factors. The relatively low degree of divergence among SIs in closely related proteobacterial species (see Introduction) also lends support to this idea.This pattern of surface-exposed sequence insertions is reminiscent of the small subunits of eukaryotic RNAPs, which also are surface-exposed (at least in RNAPII); vary in composition to some extent among RNAPI, RNAPII, and RNAPIII; and can affect the biochemical properties of the enzyme yet are dispensable for core function. The RNAPII subunits 4 and 7, for instance, are readily dissociated from RNAP and affect its biochemical properties but are dispensable for nucleotide addition (53Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Google Scholar,54Orlicky S.M. Tran P.T. Sayre M.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10097-10102Google Scholar); deletion of RNAPII subunit 9, like deletions in ॆ′SI3, affects responses of the RNAPs to their respective RNA cleavage factors, GreB (14Zakharova N. Bass I. Arsenieva E. Nikiforov V. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24912-24920Google Scholar) and TFIIS (55Awrey D.E. Weilbaecher R.G. Hemming S.A. Orlicky S.M. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14747-14754Google Scholar). Perhaps the bacterial sequence insertions are like these small eukaryotic RNAP subunits, conferring distinctive properties on the RNAPs of different bacterial species much as the small RNAP subunits may confer distinctive properties on RNAPI, RNAPII, and RNAPIII. The amino acid sequences of the two largest subunits of cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs),1called ॆ′ and ॆ in bacteria, are remarkably conserved among multisubunit RNAPs from eubacteria to the human homologues, RNAPI, RNAPII, and RNAPIII (1Sweetser D. Nonet M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1192-1196Google Scholar, 2Jokerst R.S. Weeks J.R. Zehring W.A. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 266-275Google Scholar). Recently determined crystal structures of yeast and bacterial RNAPs (3Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L., C., R. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Google Scholar, 4Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Google Scholar) reveal the structural congruity responsible for this conservation, which extends far beyond the catalytically important residues (5Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 687-698Google Scholar, 6Darst S.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 155-162Google Scholar, 7Severinov K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 118-125Google Scholar). Representing the bulk of the enzyme, ॆ′ and ॆ (and their yeast homologues, Rpb1 and Rpb2) form two halves of a crab claw-shaped molecule, in which the secondary structures of the homologous subunits are nearly identical within 25 Å of the active site (located at the internal junction between the claws). The divergence among RNAP's large subunits generally increases toward the exposed surface of the molecule and frequently is manifest as insertions of up to several hundred amino acids that are characteristic of different evolutionary lineages (3Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L., C., R. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Google Scholar). This pattern of surface sequence variation in RNAPs, which in eukaryotes includes additional subunits bound at the enzyme's periphery, led to the idea that the conserved catalytic core of RNAP is adapted to various environments and cellular milieus by the addition of surface modules that interact with different regulatory factors (4Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Google Scholar, 7Severinov K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 118-125Google Scholar, 8Sousa R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 186-190Google Scholar). In bacteria, the most studied examples of lineage-specific sequence insertions (SIs) 2Sequence insertions in E. coli RNAP previously have been designated DR, to signify dispensable regions (see Ref. 7Severinov K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 118-125Google Scholar and references therein). We prefer the less restrictive abbreviation SI to signify lineage-specific sequence insertions, because E. coli cells containing SI deletions are inviable in at least some conditions and exhibit altered biochemical properties, suggesting that these features of RNAPs play important functional roles. Further, the SI nomenclature is applicable to other bacterial RNAPs for which functional tests have not been performed.2Sequence insertions in E. coli RNAP previously"

Analyses of this region demonstrated the presence of a GATA-binding site that is necessary for the promoter activation in endothelial cells. We have reported recently the presence of a novel NFY-binding sequence in this region that does not conform to the consensus NFY-binding sequence CCAAT. NFY was shown to function as a repressor of the VWF promoter through interaction with this novel binding site. Here we report that the NFY interacts with histone deacetylases (HDACs) in a cell type-specific manner and recruits them to the VWF promoter to inhibit the promoter activity in non-endothelial cells. Analyses of the acetylation status of histones in the chromatin region containing the VWF promoter sequences demonstrated that these sequences are associated with acetylated histone H4 specifically in endothelial cells. It was also demonstrated that HDACs are specifically recruited to the same chromatin region in non-endothelial cells. We also demonstrated that GATA6 is the GATA family member that interacts with the VWF promoter and that GATA6 is associated with NFY specifically in non-endothelial cells. We propose that NFY recruits HDACs to the VWF promoter, which may result in deacetylation of GATA6 as well as of histones in non-endothelial cells, thus leading to promoter inactivation.

Emerging concepts in the mechanism of gene regulation suggest that in addition to DNA-binding transcription factors, cofactors that can either confer cell type specificity and/or participate in modification of chromatin structures also play an important role in the mechanism of regulation of gene expression (14Narlikar G.J.

Orkin S.H. Development. 2000; 127: 2031-2040Google Scholar). States of chromatin structures that contain a gene also play a central role in regulation of gene expression. Functions of many DNA-binding trans-acting factors are regulated by cofactors with chromatin-modifying properties including histone acetylation/deacetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation (17Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Google Scholar). Specifically, many coactivators with histone acetyltransferase (HAT)1 and deacetylase (HDAC) functions are recruited to the promoters by complex formation with trans-acting factors (14Narlikar G.J. Fan H.-U. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Google Scholar). Recruitments of coactivators with chromatin modifying functions to specific promoters participate in determining the role of a trans-acting factor as an activator or a repressor. Coactivators such as CREB-binding protein, P300, and PCAF with HAT activities can acetylate histones, thus conferring an active chromatin structure to the promoter, leading to activation (18Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Google Scholar, 19Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Google Scholar). These coactivators may also acetylate specific trans-acting factors, such as p53 and GATA1, and therefore increase their transcriptional activity (20Hung H.-L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Google Scholar, 21Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Google Scholar). Coactivators with HDAC function in contrast remove acetyl groups from histones and confer an inactive chromatin state to the promoters, thus leading to repression (14Narlikar G.J. Fan H.-U. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Google Scholar). A DNA-binding trans-acting factor may function as an activator or a repressor depending on its interaction with cofactors that have HAT or HDAC function. GATA2, while being an activator of gene expression in hematopoietic stem cells, can also function as a repressor when complexed with HDAC3 (22Ozawa Y. Towatari M. Tsuzuki S. Hayakawa F. Maeda T. Miyata Y. Tanimoto M. Saito H. Blood. 2001; 98: 2116-2123Google Scholar). Trans-acting factors YY1 and NF-κB can also function as either an activator or a repressor depending on their interaction with HATs or HDACs (23Yao Y.-L. Yang W.-M. Seto E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5979-5991Google Scholar, 24Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Google Scholar). The binding sequence of YY1 also appears to participate in whether this factor functions as a repressor or an activator (25Shrivastava A. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5151-5155Google Scholar). Analyses of the endothelial specific regulation of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) promoter have resulted in characterization of several trans-acting factors that participate in regulation of the activity of this promoter. An Ets and a member of the GATA family of trans-acting factors were shown to function as activators while Oct1 and NF1 were shown to function as repressors of the VWF promoter (7Schwachtgen J.L.

Lynch D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated (27Peng Y. Jahroudi N. Blood. 2002; 99: 2408-2417Google Scholar) that the NFY transcription factor functions as both an activator and a repressor of the VWF promoter activity. This dual repressor/activator function of NFY appears to be modulated through its differential binding sequences. Two distinct DNA sequences with no homologies are used as binding sites for NFY in the VWF promoter. NFY functions as an activator when interacting with the sequence CCAAT (previously reported NFY consensus binding site) at position −18 in the VWF promoter, whereas it functions as a repressor when interacting with a novel binding sequence (sequences +226 to +234) located in the first exon (27Peng Y. Jahroudi N. Blood. 2002; 99: 2408-2417Google Scholar). Based on these results, we have hypothesized that the function of NFY may be dependent on the cofactors that interact with this ubiquitous trans-acting factor and thus modulate its trans-acting function as either an activator or a repressor. In this report, we demonstrated that the function of NFY as a repressor is mediated through cell type-specific recruitment of HDACs to the VWF promoter, resulting in the promoter inactivation in non-endothelial cells. We also identified GATA6 as the member of the GATA trans-acting factor family that interacts with the VWF promoter and demonstrates a cell type-specific association of GATA6 and NFY. We hypothesized that these cell-specific associations of DNA-binding trans-acting factors and cofactors provide a molecular basis for determining the endothelial specific activation pattern of the VWF gene expression. HEK293 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown and maintained as described previously (27Peng Y. Jahroudi N. Blood. 2002; 99: 2408-2417Google Scholar, 28Dichek D. Quertermous T. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 289-292Google Scholar). Generation of plasmids HGH-1, HGH-1K, and HGH-1KY and transfection of HEK293 cells were carried out as described previously (27Peng Y. Jahroudi N. Blood. 2002; 99: 2408-2417Google Scholar). For trichostatin A (TSA) treatment experiments, stably transfected HEK293 cells were grown in 100-mm culture dishes for 24 h prior to addition of TSA (100 ng/ml) (Sigma) to the media. Growth hormone assay was carried out as described previously (26Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). Growth hormone assays were performed on transfected cells prior to addition of TSA and 48 h after TSA treatment. Nuclear extract from HUVEC was prepared by the method of Schreiber et al. (29Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequences +206 to +236 of the VWF promoter were radioactively labeled using [32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase as described previously (26Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). Nuclear extract (12 μg) was incubated with 1 μg of appropriate antibodies (or no antibody) in a 19-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Following 15 min of incubation on ice, 1 μl of the probe (8000 cpm) was added to each reaction mixture and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Complexes were resolved on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris borate EDTA buffer (pH 8.3) as described previously (27Peng Y. Jahroudi N. Blood. 2002; 99: 2408-2417Google Scholar). IP/Western blots were performed as described previously (30Bertagna A. Jahroudi N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 837-844Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from HUVEC and HEK293 cells (50 μg) were pre-cleared and immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies (5 μg), and immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (30Bertagna A. Jahroudi N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 837-844Google Scholar). The ChIP experiments were performed according to Boyd et al. (31Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.E. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Google Scholar) and the chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) with modifications. The cells were exposed to 1% formaldehyde (Fisher) for 10 min at 22 °C to obtain cross-linked chromatin. Reactions were stopped by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. To harvest the cells, the plates were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 0.2× trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) in phosphate-buffered saline, and then scraped. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 100 ng/ml aprotinin, and 100 ng/ml leupeptin. The cell numbers were determined at the last wash. The cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm PMSF, 100 ng/ml leupeptin and aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 20 min, followed by the addition of Nonidet P-40 (final concentration of 0.5%) and brief vortexing. Nuclear pellets obtained by brief centrifugation were resuspended in buffer S (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 0.5 mm PMSF, and 100 ng/ml leupeptin and aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cross-linked chromatin were subjected to sonication using VibraCellTM (Sonics and Material Inc., Danbury, CT) to obtain DNA fragments of ∼200 bp. Fragmented chromatin was pelleted by brief centrifugation, and samples corresponding to ∼106 cells were diluted 10 times in buffer C (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 167 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, and 100 ng/ml leupeptin and aprotinin). Prior to immunoprecipitation the samples were pre-cleared with the addition of 80 μl of A/G protein for 2 h at 4 °C. An aliquot of the pre-cleared chromatin (10 μl) was saved for analysis of total input, and the remaining samples were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of appropriate antibodies or no antibody. The immunoprecipitated chromatin was washed sequentially with wash buffers 1, 2, 3, and 4 (wash buffer 1: 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40; wash buffer 2: 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl; wash buffer 3: 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 1 mm EDTA; and wash buffer 4: 10 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 1 mm EDTA). Then the chromatin was eluted by a 15-min incubation in 150 μl of fresh buffer E (1% SDS, 50 mm NaHCO3). To reverse cross-linking, the samples were incubated at 65 °C for 4 h in a buffer containing 200 mm NaCl and 1 μg of RNase A followed by treatment with proteinase K and ethanol precipitation. The pellets were collected by microcentrifugation, resuspended in 20 μl of H2O, and subjected to PCR analysis. The PCRs were performed with appropriate primer pairs. The human VWF promoter region form −30 to +155 was amplified with the following primers: primer 1, 5′-ATTAAAAGGAGGCCAATCCCCTGTTGTGGC-3′, and primer 2, 5′-CTGCTGCAAAGGCTCAATCAGGTCTGCTA-3′. The VWF promoter region form +155 to +247 was amplified with the following primers: 2T, 5′-GCTGAGAGCATGGCCTAGGGTGGTGGGCGGCAC-3′; primer 3, 5′-CCCCTGCAAATGAGGGCTGCGGCTATCTCCAAG-3′. The VWF-HGH plasmids in stably transfected cells were amplified with HH1T, 5′-TAGCAGACCTGATTGAGCCTTTGCAGCAGC-3′ (according to the VWF sequence +127 to +156), and HGH-2, 5′-AGT GGT TCG GGG AGT TGG GCC TTG GGA TCC-3′ (according to the HGH sequence +1 to +30). Human growth hormone gene starting from the position +1 was cloned in the multiple cloning site in plasmid pΦHGH (provided by Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). The VWF promoter in all VWF-HGH plasmid was cloned immediately upstream of the +1 position of the human growth hormone gene. The VCAM-specific primers are VCAM-3T, 5′-CCCCACCCCCTTAACCCACATTGGATTCAG-3′, and VCAM-4B, 5′-TCCTCTCTCTGTCCTGGCAAAAGAAGACAC-3′. β-Actin promoter-specific primers used are primer-actin1, 5′-TGCCTAGGTCACCCACTAATG-3′, and primer-actin 2, 5′-GTGGCCCGTGATGAAGGCTA-3′. PCRs contained 1 μl of immunoprecipitated chromatin or diluted total input chromatin, 50 ng of each primer, 25 μl of TaqPCR Master Mixture (Qiagen, Germany) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. After 25–35 cycles of amplification, PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and analyzed by ethidium bromide staining. The antibodies used are as follows: anti-GATA2, anti-GATA4, anti-GATA-6, anti-HDAC2, and mouse IgG from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-HDAC1, anti-acetylated histone H3, and anti-acetylated histone H4 from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); and anti-NFY-A from Pharmingen. We have demonstrated recently (27Peng Y. Jahroudi N. Blood. 2002; 99: 2408-2417Google Scholar) that NFY transcription factor functions both as an activator and a repressor of the VWF promoter activity through two distinct binding sequences. Because NFY is shown to associate with cofactors that function as HATs (30Bertagna A. Jahroudi N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 837-844Google Scholar, 32Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1430-1434Google Scholar,33Faniello M.C. Bevilacqua M.A. Condorelli G. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Avvedimento V.E. Cimino F. Costanzo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7623-7626Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the dual function of NFY may be modulated through recruitment of HATs and HDACs depending on its binding sequence. To test this hypothesis, we carried out ChIP experiments to first determine whether NFY interacts with the VWF promoter in the context of chromatin in vivo and whether the VWF promoter activity is associated with the status of histone acetylation. For these analyses, we carried out ChIP experiments of the endogenous VWF promoter in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and HEK293 cells. These two cell types were chosen as models of human VWF expressing (HUVEC) and non-expressing (HEK293) cell types. To determine directly whether NFY interacts with chromatin containing the VWF promoter, we used antibodies that specifically recognize the NFY-A subunit of NFY complex to immunoprecipitate native chromatin from these two cell types. We then determined the presence of the VWF promoter fragments in the immunoprecipitated fractions using PCR analysis with the VWF-specific primers that amplify the +155 to +247 sequences of the VWF promoter (Fig.1 A). These sequences contain the novel NFY-binding site that functions as a repressor, although precipitated chromatin fragments may also include the VWF promoter sequences that contain the upstream CCAAT-NFY-binding site. Primers that specifically recognize the actin promoter sequences were used as control. The results demonstrated that NFY-A-immunoprecipitated chromatin in both HUVEC and HEK293 cells was specifically amplified with the VWF-specific primers but not with the actin-specific primers (Fig.1 B,upper panel). Both the actin and the VWF-specific primers amplified the appropriate gene fragments from non-immunoprecipitated chromatin input, demonstrating PCR efficiency (Fig. 1 B,lower panel). The fragment sizes amplified by the VWF and the actin primers were 92 and 160 bp, respectively. These data demonstrated that NFY interacts with endogenous VWF promoter but not the actin promoter in the context of chromatin in both HUVEC and HEK293 cells (Fig. 1 B). To demonstrate directly whether the active VWF promoter is associated with acetylated histones, we used antibodies that specifically recognize acetylated histone H3 and acetylated histone H4 to immunoprecipitate native chromatin from these two cell types. We then determined the presence of the VWF promoter fragment in the immunoprecipitated fractions using PCR analysis with the VWF-specific primers that amplify a 185-bp fragment corresponding to the sequences −30 to +155 region of the VWF promoter (Fig. 1 A). We also included anti-NFY-A antibody in these analyses to confirm the interaction of NFY with the VWF promoter sequences with these set of primers. Immunoprecipitated samples in absence of antibodies were used as control for PCR analysis. The results of these analyses confirmed the interaction of NFY transcription factor with the VWF promoter in both cell types (Fig.1 C, lanes 3 and 4) and demonstrated that the VWF promoter is similarly associated with acetylated histone H3 in both HUVEC and HEK293 cells (Fig. 1 C,lanes 7 and 8). However, acetylated histone H4 was shown to be specifically associated with the VWF promoter in HUVEC (Fig.1 C,lane 5), thus demonstrating that the state of acetylation of histone H4 is correlated to the VWF promoter activity. It was demonstrated previously that a fragment of the VWF promoter spanning the sequences −90 to +155 functions as a core promoter and is activated in both endothelial and non-endothelial cells, while a fragment that spans the sequences −90 to +247 functions as an endothelial specific promoter, and its activity is repressed in non-endothelial cells (26Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar, 27Peng Y. Jahroudi N. Blood. 2002; 99: 2408-2417Google Scholar). Mutation and transfection analysis in HEK293 cells demonstrated that the inhibition of this promoter function in non-endothelial cells is mediated through NFY binding to the novel binding site located at the sequences +226 to +234 (27Peng Y. Jahroudi N. Blood. 2002; 99: 2408-2417Google Scholar). To determine whether repression/activation of this promoter fragment in transfected cells is correlated to changes in acetylation status of associated histones, we performed ChIP analysis of the stably transfected HEK293 cells. The cells were stably transfected with plasmids HGH-1, HGH-1K, and HGH-1KY that contain human growth hormone gene fused to various VWF promoter fragments. Plasmid HGH-1 contains the core VWF promoter fragment (the sequences −90 to +155) that is active in all cell types including HEK293 cells. Plasmid HGH-1K contains wild type sequences −90 to +247 of the VWF promoter that has significantly reduced activity (compared with HGH-1) in HEK293 cells. Plasmid HGH-1KY contains sequences −90 to +247 with 3-base substitution mutations at the repressor-NFY-binding site. We have reported previously that this mutation inhibits NFY interaction with the VWF DNA sequences and results in promoter activation in HEK293 cells to a similar level as that of the core promoter (HGH-1). The levels of growth hormone expression (that is an indicator of these VWF promoters activities) from stably transfected HEK293 cells were reported previously (27Peng Y. Jahroudi N. Blood. 2002; 99: 2408-2417Google Scholar) and confirmed by repeating the growth hormone assay from the transfected cells as shown in Fig. 2 A. To determine correlation of these VWF promoter activities to the states of histone acetylation, ChIP analyses were performed using anti-acetylated histone H3 and H4 antibodies and the VWF-specific primers (amplifying a 185-bp fragment corresponding to sequences −30 to +155) for PCR detection as described above for Fig. 1 C. Primers that were used in PCR analysis detect endogenous VWF as well as transfected VWF-HGH sequences. However, we do not expect any changes in the levels of acetylated histones that are associated with endogenous VWF in these cells. Thus any differences observed reflect differences in the levels of acetylated histones that are associated with transfected VWF promoter fragments. As control we also used actin-specific primers (as described for Fig. 1 B) to demonstrate equal association of actin promoter fragment with acetylated H3 and H4 histones in all transfected cells. The results demonstrated that there were no significant differences in the levels of acetylated histone H3 that were associated with the VWF promoter sequences among all three transfected cell lines (Fig.2 B,lanes 1–3). However, acetylated histone H4 levels that were associated with the VWF promoters significantly differed in these cell lines (Fig. 2 B,lanes 4–6). The promoters that were active, HGH-1 and HGH-1KY, had significantly higher levels of acetylated histone H4 compared to HGH-1K (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 4 and 6to lane 5), which had reduced activity as determined by growth hormone analysis (as shown in Fig. 2 A). These data demonstrated that the VWF promoter fragments with deletion or mutation of the novel NFY-binding sites (HGH-1 and HGH-1KY) were active in HEK293 cells and had increased association with acetylated histone H4 compared with the VWF promoter fragment that had an intact NFY-binding site and reduced activity (HGH-1K). Because specific mutation of NFY-binding site in the HGH-1KY plasmid was correlated to an increased association of acetylated histone H4 with the VWF promoter fragment, we hypothesized that NFY may recruit histone deacetylases to the VWF promoter through interaction with the repressor element (the novel NFY-binding site located at the sequences +226 to +234), thus reducing the level of acetylation of histone H4 associated with the VWF promoter and leading to promoter inactivation. Thus, mutation of the NFY-binding site that inhibits NFY interaction with the VWF promoter would be expected to inhibit recruitment of histone deacetylases to the promoter. This results in increased level of histone H4 acetylation, consequently leading to promoter activation. To test this hypothesis, we first performed experiments in which the effects of histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A on the level of the activities of these promoter fragments were determined. HEK293 cells stably transfected with HGH-1, HGH-1K, and HGH-1KY were untreated or treated with TSA (100 ng/ml), and the growth hormone expressed was determined prior to and 48 h post-treatment. The level of growth hormone in cells expressing each plasmid was considered as 100% prior to treatment. The results demonstrated that there was an ∼50% increase in the activity of the VWF promoter fragment that contained the intact novel NFY-binding site (Fig. 2 C, HGH-1K), whereas TSA treatment had no effect on the activity of the VWF promoter fragments with deletion or mutation of novel NFY-binding sequences (Fig.2 C,HGH-1 and HGH-1KY). The results are consistent with the hypothesis that NFY may recruit HDAC(s) to the VWF promoter, and thus only the activity of the VWF promoter fragment that contains the intact NFY-binding site (HGH-1K) is affected by treatment with HDACs inhibitor. To determine whether histone deacetylases were associated with the VWF promoter sequences, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using antibodies that specifically recognize HDAC1 and HDAC2. Chromatin-HDAC complexes were isolated from HUVEC and HEK293 cells and subjected to PCR analysis using the VWF-specific primers that amplify the 92-bp fragment of the VWF corresponding to sequences +155 to +247 as described for Fig. 1 B. The results demonstrated that both HDAC1 and HDAC2 were specifically associated with endogenous VWF promoter sequences in VWF-non-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig.3 A,lanes 5 and6) but not in VWF-expressing HUVEC (Fig.3 A,lanes 2 and 3).

The reaction is a Mg2+-dependent transfer of the phosphoribosyl moiety from 5′-phosphoribosyl 1′-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to the N1 nitrogen of adenosine ring of ATP yielding phosphoribosyl-ATP and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) (Scheme FS1) (1Martin R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 257-268Google Scholar). The activity and the expression of ATP-PRTase are regulated by feedback inhibition and by repression of the his operon in response to host iron, respectively (2Dall-Larsen T. Int. J. Biochem. 1988; 20: 231-235Google Scholar, 3Rodriguez G.M. Gold B. Gomez M. Dussurget O. Smith I. Tubercle Lung Dis. 1999; 79: 287-298Google Scholar). Given the high energetic costs associated with the synthesis of a histidine molecule and the direct connections of the histidine pathway with purine, pyrimidine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, a multilevel regulatory control has been selectively retained in all bacteria studied to date. Whereas the transcriptional regulation based on nutrient conditions controls the steady-state level of enzyme over several bacterial generations, the feedback inhibition of ATP-PRTase serves as a fine-tuning control that provides rapid regulation of biosynthetic activity as a function of the available histidine. The ATP-PRTase-catalyzed reaction has been studied for more than 4 decades and was originally believed to proceed via the formation of a 5′-phosphoribosyl enzyme covalent intermediate (4Bell R.M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 539-545Google Scholar, 5Koshland Jr., D.E. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1953; 28: 416-436Google Scholar). Detailed kinetic studies refuted the presence of such an intermediate (6Brashear W.T. Parsons S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6885-6890Google Scholar). Steady-state studies of the enzymatic reaction in both directions were consistent with a sequential mechanism (7Cleland W.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1970: 1-65Google Scholar) where ATP binding precedes binding of PRPP (8Musick W.D. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 11: 1-34Google Scholar). The ATP-PRTase reaction has also been shown to be completely reversible as addition of pyrophosphate to phosphoribosyl-ATP yields ATP and PRPP (9Ames B.N. Martin R.G. Garry B.J. J. Biol.

The synergistic inhibition of the enzyme was demonstrated to occur allosterically by histidine and competitively by AMP, ADP, or guanosine tetraphosphate (10Morton D.P. Parsons S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 181: 643-648Google Scholar). AMP and ADP are both competitive inhibitors with respect to PRPP and ATP (1Martin R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 257-268Google Scholar). Histidine inhibition was first thought to be “noncompetitive” with PRPP and ATP (1Martin R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 257-268Google Scholar). A single histidine was later proposed to interact with more than one molecule of the enzyme, in a site shown to be allosteric in nature (11Bell R.M. Parsons S.M. Dubravac S.A. Redfield A.G. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4110-4118Google Scholar). A clear understanding of the molecular basis of ATP-PRTase activity and the mechanism of its regulation by histidine has been elusive due to the lack of structural information. Although structures of several PRTases are known (12Sinha S.C. Smith J.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 733-739Google Scholar), lack of sequence similarity precluded analyses based on homology modeling. Based on their structural folds, the PRTases have been subdivided into two groups (13Scapin G. Ozturk D.H. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10744-10754Google Scholar, 14Eads J.C. Ozturk D. Wexler T.B. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Structure (Camb.). 1997; 5: 47-58Google Scholar). The type I PRTases have a central parallel five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. Type II PRTases, such as quinolinic acid PRTase, have a modified α/β-barrel as the catalytic core. Association of alternate structural motifs with PRTases has suggested a convergent evolution of these enzymes. In this study we report the structure of ATP-PRTase fromMycobacterium tuberculosis (mtATP-PRTase) without bound ligands (apo) and in a ternary complex with the inhibitors AMP and histidine (AMP:His). These structures represent a new fold for a PRTase with a modular organization of the regulatory histidine binding domain and catalytic PRTase domains. Comparison of the inhibitor-bound structure with the apo form reveals the structural basis of the allosteric regulation by histidine. ATP, AMP, l-histidine, and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) were purchased from Sigma. PRPP and lithium sulfate were purchased from Fluka. Standard proteins for calibrating gel filtration column were purchased from AmershamBiosciences. ThehisG gene, Rv2121c from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome, was identified from the TubercuList sequence data base (15Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Google Scholar). The hisG gene was amplified using M. tuberculosisgenomic DNA as a template. The PCR product was cloned into a pET28a expression vector (Novagen) with N-terminal His tag and transformed into Escherichia coli overexpression strain, BL21(DE3). Cells were incubated at 37 °C until the optical density reached 0.6 and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubation was continued for an additional 4 h. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1m imidazole. The cells were lysed using a French press. The cell extract was applied onto a 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Amersham Biosciences), and the target protein was eluted using an imidazole gradient. The eluate was concentrated by Centriprep (Amicon) to 20 mg/ml and applied onto a Sephadex 200 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES (1 mm EDTA and dithiothreitol (pH 7.5)) as a final step. The protein was more than 95% pure as observed on an SDS-PAGE gel. Selenomethionylated protein was prepared according to published methods (16Davies C. Heath R.J. White S.W. Rock C.O. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 185-195Google Scholar). The pET28a-hisG plasmid was transformed into E. coli B834(DE3) (Novagen) Met auxotroph strain. Cells were grown in LB medium until an optical density of 0.6 was obtained. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with LB medium, and resuspended in M9 minimal medium lacking l-Met. SeMet was then added to a final concentration of 0.05 μg/ml along with 35 μg/ml kanamycin. Cultures were then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside followed by incubation for 4 h at 37 °C. The protein was purified using the same methods as for the apoprotein. Initial crystallization conditions were obtained using Crystal Screen 2 from Hampton Research. Crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 16 °C. The apocrystals were obtained by mixing equal volumes (2–3 μl) of 20 mg/ml protein with a buffer containing 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5) and 1.8 m magnesium sulfate as a precipitant. AMP:His-crystals were obtained in condition number 15 of Crystal Screen 2 from Hampton Research (0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.6), 0.5 m ammonium sulfate, and 1.0 m lithium sulfate) in the presence of 5 mm AMP and 100 μm histidine. A complete and redundant high resolution data set was collected at BioCARS beamline 14BMC at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) data sets were collected for both the apocrystal (MAD1) and AMP:His crystal (MAD2) (Table I). All data sets were indexed and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA of the CCP4 program suite (17Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). Unit cell dimensions for apocrystal were a = b = 132.5 Å, c = 110.5 Å, α = β = 90, and γ = 120. Space group was R32. The inhibitor complex crystallized also in the space group R32, but the cell dimension changed by about 14 and 11% in a, b (113.8 Å), and c (124.3 Å), respectively. Calculation of solvent content (18Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Google Scholar) indicated that for both crystals the asymmetric unit contained one protomer of ATP-PRTase and 58 (apo) or 48% (AMP:His) solvent.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData collectionaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell: 3.0–3.17 Å for the MAD1 data sets; 2.6–2.75 Å for the MAD2 data sets; 2.7–2.97 Å for the apo data sets, and 1.8–1.93 Å for the AMP:His data sets.WavelengthResolution% completeR symbRsym=100×ΣhΣi|I(h)l−〈I(h)〉|ΣhΣi〈I(h)i〉where I is the observed intensity, and 〈I〉 is the average intensity of multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections.ÅÅMAD10.9642 (remote)3.099.9 (99.8)0.195 (0.569)0.9795 (peak)3.099.9 (99.8)0.109 (0.306)0.9798 (inflection)3.093.7 (99.6)0.171 (0.701)MAD20.9571 (remote)2.699.1 (99.7)0.088 (0.447)0.9798 (peak)2.699.1 (99.6)0.081 (0.185)0.9800 (inflection)2.699.1 (99.7)0.156 (0.207)Apo1.02.799.1 (99.9)0.067 (0.150)AMP:His1.01.897.5 (99.5)0.047 (0.134)Refinement statisticsApoAMP:HisResolution range (Å)28–2.720–1.8No. reflectionsWorking set985025,850Test set5471366No. atomsProtein20732097Solvent199251R crystcR=∑‖Fo|−|Fc‖/Σ|Fo|.Rcryst and Rfree were calculated using the working and the test reflection sets, respectively. 5% of the entire reflection was taken as test set.19.219.8R freecR=∑‖Fo|−|Fc‖/Σ|Fo|.Rcryst and Rfree were calculated using the working and the test reflection sets, respectively. 5% of the entire reflection was taken as test set.26.123.6Average B (Å2)18.317.9r.m.s.d. from idealBond length0.048 Å0.014 ÅBond angle3.6 °1.5 °a Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell: 3.0–3.17 Å for the MAD1 data sets; 2.6–2.75 Å for the MAD2 data sets; 2.7–2.97 Å for the apo data sets, and 1.8–1.93 Å for the AMP:His data sets.b Rsym=100×ΣhΣi|I(h)l−〈I(h)〉|ΣhΣi〈I(h)i〉where I is the observed intensity, and 〈I〉 is the average intensity of multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections.c R=∑‖Fo|−|Fc‖/Σ|Fo|.Rcryst and Rfree were calculated using the working and the test reflection sets, respectively. 5% of the entire reflection was taken as test set. Open table in a new tab Selenium sites were located using SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Google Scholar) with three different wavelength MAD data. The sites were refined using MLPHARE (20Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering: Daresbury Study Weekend Proceedings. Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1991: 80-86Google Scholar), and protein phases were calculated with SHARP (21de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Google Scholar) (30–3.0 Å) and improved by density modification using CNS (crystallography and NMR system) (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). A polyalanine backbone model was built into the electron density using O (23Jones T.A. Zhow J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Based on marker amino acids such as SeMet, Arg, and aromatic residues, polyalanines were converted to the original sequence. Initial refinement was performed by rigid body refinement, simulated annealing and individual B factor refinement. InitialR factor and R free were 35 and 42%, respectively. After an intensive series of manual rebuilding and refinement, the R factor andR free dropped down to 28 and 33%, respectively. Solvent molecules were picked using Xfit (24McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Google Scholar) and refined. As a final refinement step, the Restrained TLS refinement with Refmac5 (25Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 57: 122-133Google Scholar) was used, and the R factors were 19.2 and 26.1% (TableI, bottom). Molecular replacement of the AMP:His-bound data was attempted with the apo structure as a search model. However, any reasonable solution was not obtained from the whole molecule or separate domains. Therefore, another MAD experiment was performed. Four Se sites were determined by SOLVE, and phases were calculated with SHARP up to 2.6 Å. The MAD map was made after solvent flattening with DM (density modification) (26Cowtan K.D. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) of the CCP4 program suite. The apo structure was manually fitted into the electron density to make an initial model for the inhibitor-bound structure. Positional refinement and molecular dynamics were performed, and theR free was 30%. Shake & Warp (27Kantardjieff K.A. Höchtl P. Segelke B.W. Tao F.-M. Rupp B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 735-743Google Scholar) was used to remove phase bias from the model. Solvent molecules were picked and the restrained TLS refinement with Refmac5 was performed. The refinement statistics are shown in Table I, bottom. We followed an experimental procedure described previously (28Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Google Scholar) for characterizing the number of free cysteines per molecule of protein. Briefly, 0.1 ml of a protein solution was added to 3.1 ml of reaction buffer containing 0.3 mm DTNB to achieve a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml (9.4 μm) of freshly prepared reaction mixture. The absorbance of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate anion (TNB2−) was measured at 412 nm until it reached a plateau. The numbers of free cysteines were calculated from the absorbance (0.18 and 0.35 absorbance units for the apo and AMP:His form, respectively) and molar absorption coefficient of TNB2− (14,150 m−1cm−1) covalently linked to free cysteines. The numbers of the free cysteines corresponding to the obtained absorbance were 2 and 1 (equivalent to 9.3 and 21.3 μm TNB2−). A Superdex 200 gel filtration column (24-ml bed volume, Amersham Biosciences) was used to estimate the molecular weight of ATP-PRTase and to observe the effect of different ligands on oligomerization. The column was calibrated using low and high molecular standard proteins (from Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and dithiothreitol. 100 μm histidine and 1 mm AMP were added in the same buffer to observe the change of oligomeric status in the presence of the inhibitors. In the absence of histidine at 4 °C, more than 99% of the apoenzyme eluted as a dimer at a low protein concentration (less than 50 μg/ml). We were not able to detect the dimer when the protein was preincubated at 10 μm histidine; only hexamers and higher oligomers were detected. The x-ray structure of the recombinant mtATP-PRTase was solved from electron density maps calculated by MAD methods using crystals of selenomethionylated protein formed in the space group R32. Crystals were produced in the absence of any ligands or after incubation of protein with two inhibitors, adenosine monophosphate and histidine (AMP:His). The structures have been refined to R factors of 19.2 (apo) and 19.8% (AMP:His) at resolutions of 2.7 and 1.8 Å, respectively (Table I). In both cases, the refined structure contains 276 of the 284 residues present in mtATP-PRTase. The residues 186–193 were disordered and omitted from the final model. mtATP-PRTase is an elongated molecule consisting of 10 α-helices and 15 β-strands (Fig.1 a) composed in 3 domains. Domain I (residues 1–90, 175–184, and 194–211) contains a central β-sheet consisting of four parallel β-strands (β1, β3, β4, and β5) and two anti-parallel strands (β2 and β11). The β-sheet is surrounded by 3 α-helices, α1 on one side and α2 and α3 on the other side. Domain II (residues 91–174) is also an α/β-structure composed of four (β7–10) parallel β-strands and one (β6) anti-parallel β-strand with two α-helices on each side (α4 and α5 on one side and α6 and α7 on the other side). Domain III (residues 212–284) has one β-sheet consisting of four anti-parallel β-strands (β12–15) with two α-helices (α9 and α10) on one side of the β-sheet. Domains I and II form the catalytic core of ATP-PRTase. The competitive inhibitor AMP binds in a cleft located between the two domains (Fig.1 b) and makes the most of its bonding interactions with residues from domain II. The feedback inhibitor histidine was located far from the active site in domain III (Fig. 1). The electron density of both inhibitors is shown in Fig. 1, c and d.The catalytic core of ATP-PRTase (domains I and II) is similar to theE. coli glutamine-binding protein (Protein Data Bank code 1WDN; r.m.s.d. 3.4 for 172 Cα atoms) (29Sun Y.J. Rose J. Wang B.C. Hsiao C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 219-229Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 a), an E. coli histidine-binding protein (Protein Data Bank code1HSL; r.m.s.d. 3.2 for 164 Cα atoms) (30Yao N. Trakhanov S. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4769-4779Google Scholar) as well as the ligand binding core of a glutamate receptor fromSynechocystis sp. (Protein Data Bank code1IIW) (31Mayer M.L. Olson R. Gouaux E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 815-836Google Scholar) and that of rat (Protein Data Bank code 1LB8) (32Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Google Scholar, 33.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). A VAST 2On-line address, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure/VAST/vastsearch.html. structural similarity search using domain III found that the domain shares a high degree of similarity with the E. coli signal transducing protein PII (Protein Data Bank code 2PII; r.m.s.d. 1.4 for 63 Cα atoms) and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain from human elongation factor-1β (Protein Data Bank code 1B64; r.m.s.d. 2.0 for 57 Cα atoms). Whereas all the four β-strands and two α-helices are conserved between structures of PII and domain III of the ATP-PRTase, the two differ in the length of their connecting loops (i.e.7 residues longer in the case of PII) (Fig. 2 a). Interestingly, proteins of PII family (34Cheah E. Carr P.D. Suffolk P.M. Vasudevan S.G. Dixon N.E. Ollis D.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 981-990Google Scholar) and GlnK (35Xu Y. Cheah E. Carr P.D. van Heeswijk W.C. Westerhoff H.V. Vasudevan S.G. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 149-165Google Scholar) form a trimer similar to that observed for domain III of ATP-PRTase (35Xu Y. Cheah E. Carr P.D. van Heeswijk W.C. Westerhoff H.V. Vasudevan S.G. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 149-165Google Scholar, 36van Heeswijk W.C. Wen D. Clancy P. Jaggi R. Ollis D.L. Westerhoff H.V. Vasudevan S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3942-3947Google Scholar). Gel filtration, sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation, and light scattering experiments on the E. coli enzyme have demonstrated that the ATP-PRTase exists in equilibrium between its active dimeric form (Fig. 2 c) and inactive higher oligomeric forms (37Klungsoyr L. Kryvi H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 227: 327-336Google Scholar, 38Tebar A.R. Fernandez V.M. Martin Del Rio R. Ballesteros A.O. Experientia (Basel). 1973; 29: 1477-1479Google Scholar, 39Lohkamp B. Coggins J.R. Lapthorn A.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1488-1491Google Scholar). Gel filtration experiments showed similar behavior for the mt ATP-PRTase (see “Experimental Procedures”). In general, ATPase hexamers are more abundant at concentrations of enzyme higher than 1 mg/ml or in the presence of stoichiometric AMP, phosphoribosyl-ATP, and histidine and particularly in the combination of one of the nucleotides and histidine (37Klungsoyr L. Kryvi H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 227: 327-336Google Scholar). On the other hand, low enzyme concentrations (50 μg/ml) or the presence of the substrate PRPP seems to dissociate the hexamers, or higher oligomers, into active dimers (38Tebar A.R. Fernandez V.M. Martin Del Rio R. Ballesteros A.O. Experientia (Basel). 1973; 29: 1477-1479Google Scholar). Thus regulation of the oligomeric state of ATP-PRTase appears to be an efficient way of controlling the enzyme activity by sensing the intracellular concentrations of both enzyme and histidine. At low in vivointracellular histidine levels and enzyme concentrations, ATP-PRTase most likely exists as active dimers and constitutively replenishes the histidine pool. Under conditions of high histidine demand, such as active assimilation of nitrogen, transcriptional derepression of thehisG gene perhaps allows even higher intracellular concentration of ATP-PRTase that may be hexameric. However, once the histidine level exceeds the demand, the expression of hisGgene is reduced, and the existing ATP-PRTase is inhibited by histidine. Some proteobacteria have a shorter version of the ATP-PRTase, missing about 100 residues from the C terminus (domain III). In these bacteria, HisG can associate with another protein HisZ, a parahomolog of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that is functionally unknown (40Sissler M. Delorme C. Bond J. Ehrlich S.D. Renault P. Francklyn C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8985-8990Google Scholar). Recent equilibrium sedimentation studies on HisG and HisZ fromLactococcus lactis show that they individually form stable homodimers. However, together the two proteins form an octameric structure that can be destabilized by allosteric regulators AMP and histidine (41Bovee M.L. Champagne K.S. Demeler B. Francklyn C.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11838-11846Google Scholar). No homolog of HisZ is found in M. tuberculosis genome. However, given that HisZ is required for the activity and regulation of the truncated HisG, it is tempting to speculate that it may be compensating for some of the functions of the missing domain III. Whereas alternate roles and mechanisms for regulation of HisZ may not be ruled out, quaternary associations of HisG, both homo- or heteromeric, seem to have direct influence on the function and regulation of these enzymes. In both the apo and AMP:His structures of ATP-PRTase the packing in the crystal is consistent with a hexamer because of crystallographic 3- and 2-fold symmetry axes in the R32 space group that generates a “trimer of dimers” (Fig. 3 a). However, comparison of the intersubunit interactions in the two structures showed that the hexamers are different with the histidine-containing complex being much more compact than the apoprotein (Fig. 3, d and e). In the case of the AMP:His hexamer, the subunit-accessible surface area buried is 3078 Å2, and it is only 2417 Å2 in the apo form. The dimer interface buries 1203 and 965 Å2 of accessible surface of each subunit in apo or AMP:His forms, respectively. The interactions at the dimer interface are primarily from the catalytic core (domains I and II), whereas those involved at the hexamer interface are mainly from domain III. The most prominent structural feature of the AMP:His hexamer is the extended β-sheet for domain III formed by the C-terminal β-strand (residues 280–284) with the penultimate β-strand (β15, residues 273–276) of the adjacent subunit (Fig. 3 b). The catalytic site of ATP-PRTase is formed by a cleft located between domains I and II (Fig. 1,a and b). The substrate-binding sites could be identified from highly negative electrostatic potential of the protein, presumably involved in binding to the Mg2+ ions required for catalysis and by the presence of sulfate ions from the crystallization buffer, marking the probable binding sites of phosphate groups of the substrates. The inhibitor AMP (competitive with respect to ATP) was located in clear electron density from omit maps calculated from diffraction data collected from crystals of HisG that were incubated with AMP and His prior to crystallization. AMP bound to the expected ATP-phosphoribosyltransferase signature sequence region (Glu141–Leu162), which was identified from PROSITE (42Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Google Scholar) (documentation number PDOC01020). Residues from both domains I and II contributed to the binding of AMP (Fig.4 a). The phosphate of the AMP is coordinated by the P-loop motif (residues from Asp154 to Thr161) found in the domain II. One of the phosphate oxygens of the AMP, O1P, forms hydrogen bonds with backbone amides of Gly159 and Gly157. O2P makes a hydrogen bond with OG1 of Thr161, and O3P hydrogen bonds with backbone amides of Thr161 and Arg160 as well as with OG of Ser158. O5 of the AMP interacts with the backbone nitrogen of Ser158. N1 of the adenosine base forms hydrogen bonds with three ordered water molecules. One of them is a water-mediated interaction between the N1 of AMP and OD2 of Asp70. N1 also hydrogen bonds via an ordered water molecule, with OD1 of Asp70 and OG of Ser90. N6 of the adenosine ring forms a hydrogen bond with OH of Tyr116. Of these, only the interactions of residues 70 and 90 are from domain I and the others are from domain II. The 2-OH and 3-OH of the AMP are close to domain I of the neighboring subunit and interact with the side chain carboxyls of Asp30′ and Asp33′ of that subunit. As these interactions would contribute to the compactness of the hexamer, they may be responsible for the synergistic behavior of AMP toward inhibition with histidine. Analysis of the structure suggests that ATP would bind in a manner very similar to AMP binding. The presence of a tightly associated sulfate ion close to the AMP-binding site along with several basic residues (Arg49, Lys9, Lys32, and Arg160) indicate that PRPP may bind in a region adjacent to the AMP-binding site (Fig. 4 b). Moreover, consideration of the catalytic reaction would require that PRPP be oriented such that the C1 carbon of the ribosyl group of PRPP is in close proximity to N1 of the adenine ring of the ATP. The 5′-phosphate of PRPP is more likely to occupy the location occupied by the sulfate ion bound to residues Lys9 and Arg49. In this model, the leaving pyrophosphate group would interact with residue Lys32. The location of probable PRPP-binding site at the dimer interface suggests that the PRPP bound to one subunit of the dimer would be located close to the ATP bound to the other subunit of the dimer. In this model PRPP would bury the bound ATP that is consistent with the sequential mechanism observed in other PRTases where binding of base precedes binding of PRPP. The major conformational change observed in the histidine-bound form is a large twist of the domain III relative to the domain I and II (Fig.2 b). When domain I of the apoenzyme and that of the AMP:His enzyme were superimposed, the r.m.s.d. of the domain I was only 1.46 Å and that of domain II was 2.19 Å. The r.m.s.d. of the domain III, however, was 12.89 Å, due to a solid body movement of the β-sheet of the domain III induced by residues involved in binding to histidine (Fig. 2 b). Six histidines bind to the domain III clusters at both ends of three dimers, stabilizing the hexamer (Fig.3 a). These histidines are completely embedded in the domain III cluster (Fig. 3 c). Molecular surface representations of the hexamers show this conformational change from an “open” cluster (Fig. 3 d) to a “closed” cluster (Fig. 3 e). The residues involved in binding to each histidine are contributed by the two adjacent domain IIIs suggesting that direct interactions with histidine (Fig. 5 a) are responsible for bringing the three dimers together to form the hexamer. The interactions include a well ordered hydrogen bonding network with residues Asp218 and Ala273 from one subunit, residues Leu234, Gly235, Ser236, Thr238, and Leu253 of the second subunit, and an ordered water molecule. Inhibition resulting from hexamer formation is somewhat reminiscent of the allosteric mechanism observed in ribonucleotide reductase (43Kashlan O.B. Scott C.P. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 462-474Google Scholar). Feedback inhibitor-based oligomerization, resulting in either altered topology or reduced access to the active site, is emerging as a way of regulating enzymes. In the case of ATP-PRTase, the allosteric inhibition by histidine can be synergistically favored by the competitive inhibitor AMP, thus adding yet another dimension to the regulation of activity. Maximal inhibition is observed when both inhibitors AMP:His are bound (11Bell R.M. Parsons S.M. Dubravac S.A. Redfield A.G. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4110-4118Google Scholar). The structures suggest that the reason for the synergistic behavior is that binding of histidine reorients some key active site residues (Tyr116, Arg135, Arg137, Asp154, and Arg160) in the active site, and in return binding of AMP establishes additional inter-subunit interactions that stabilize the histidine-bound hexamer. These interactions are only possible with the global conformational change triggered by histidine. The presence of disulfide bonds in prokaryote intracellular enzymes has not been well documented, although crystallographic studies have shown the existence of disulfide bonds in a handful of prokaryotic enzymes (44Bourne Y. Redford S.M. Steinman H.M. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12774-12779Google Scholar,45Wells W.W. Yang Y. Deits T.L. Gan Z.R. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 66: 149-201Google Scholar). In the ATP-PRTase structure we not only observe a disulfide bond between Cys73 and Cys175 but also found that it was not present in the PRTase with AMP and histidine (Fig.5 b). In this structure the distance between the two Cαs of the cysteines was 8.6 Å, too far for disulfide bond formation. Two possible scenarios can explain this observation. First, the lack of a disulfide bond could be from the strain imposed by the conformational changes observed in the AMP:His structure possibly due to a closure between domains I and II (see Fig. 5 b). It could also be due to exposure of crystals to synchrotron radiation. Structurally and functionally significant disulfide bonds have been shown as broken in crystals exposed to synchrotron radiation (46Weik M. Ravelli R.B. Kryger G. McSweeney S. Raves M.L. Harel M. Gros P. Silman I. Kroon J. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 623-628Google Scholar). DTNB was used to determine the presence or absence of the disulfide bond between Cys73 and Cys175. In the absence of any ligands, the absorbance of TNB2− at 412 nm suggested that the disulfide was present in only two of the four cysteines. However, when the enzyme was incubated with 100 μm AMP or histidine, or 2 mm AMP with 100 μm of histidine, the molar ratio of cysteines modified per protomer was reduced to about 0.5 (see “Experimental Procedures”). We believe the reduction was due to the formation of hexamer that reduces exposure of all cysteines. When the same experiments were performed in the presence of 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, all protein forms again showed only two free cysteines. These results suggest that the disulfide is present in both the apoprotein and AMP:His protein and that the observed broken disulfide was the result of the radiation, although we cannot rule out the possibility that in the inhibitor-bound protein the disulfide rapidly reforms upon denaturation. The structure described here provides an explanation of the molecular basis of feedback inhibition of the histidine biosynthetic pathway by allosteric regulation of ATP-PRTase by histidine. The binding of histidine seems to influence activity both by stabilizing the inactive hexameric form and by sterically hindering the binding of substrates to the catalytic site. Although the presence of an allosteric domain that binds the end product of the pathway has been observed in several enzymes, to our knowledge this represents the first example for the PRTases. ATP-PRTase also appears to be another example of the convergent evolution of the PRTases.

We have developed a fluoresceinated analog of ShK (ShK-F6CA), the most potent known inhibitor of Kv1.3, for detection of Kv1.3high cells by flow cytometry. ShK-F6CA blocked Kv1.3 at picomolar concentrations with a Hill coefficient of 1 and exhibited >80-fold specificity for Kv1.3 over Kv1.1 and other KV channels. In flow cytometry experiments, ShK-F6CA specifically stained Kv1.3-expressing cells with a detection limit of ∼600 channels per cell. Rat and human T cells that had been repeatedly stimulated 7–10 times with antigen were readily distinguished on the basis of their high levels of Kv1.3 channels (>600 channels/cell) and ShK-F6CA staining from resting T cells or cells that had undergone 1–3 rounds of activation. Functional Kv1.3 expression levels increased substantially in a myelin-specific rat T cell line following myelin antigen stimulation, peaking at 15–20 h and then declining to baseline over the next 7 days, in parallel with the acquisition and loss of encephalitogenicity. Both calcium- and protein kinase C-dependent pathways were required for the antigen-induced Kv1.3 up-regulation. ShK-F6CA might be useful for rapid and quantitative detection of Kv1.3high expressing cells in normal and diseased tissues, and to visualize the distribution of functional channels in intact cells.

Studies with several myelin-specific rat T cell lines revealed a correlation between encephalitogenicity and the number of expressed Kv1.3 channels (7Beeton C. Wulff H. Barbaria J. Clot-Faybesse O.

Receptors Channels. 1998; 6: 73-87Google Scholar). In addition, in vivo Kv1.3 blockade ameliorated adoptive EAE, suggesting a crucial role of Kv1.3 in the pathogenicity of these cells (7Beeton C. Wulff H. Barbaria J. Clot-Faybesse O. Pennington M. Bernard D. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Beraud E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13942-13947Google Scholar, 12Beeton C. Barbaria J. Giraud P. Devaux J. Benoliel A. Gola M. Sabatier J. Bernard D. Crest M. Beraud E. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 936-944Google Scholar). A rapid method to detect Kv1.3high lymphocytes might therefore facilitate studies of the role of Kv1.3 in the pathogenesis of MS and its potential as a therapeutic target for this disease. The patch clamp technique is widely used to determine functionalKv1.3 and IKCa1 channel levels in lymphocytes but requires highly specialized equipment and is time-consuming, allowing the study of only a few dozen cells per day. Reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blot analysis provide a measure of channel-transcript or channel-protein expression in lymphocytes but not the number of functional channels in the cell membrane. All known Kv1.3-specific antibodies target intracellular epitopes (13Fadool D.A. Holmes T.C. Berman K. Dagan D. Levitan I.B. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1563-1573Google Scholar) in the channel making it necessary to permeabilize lymphocytes before they can be stained with these reagents. In addition, nonspecific staining imposes a further limitation to the use of antibodies for protein detection. Furthermore, no reports have yet described any success in using these antibodies for immunostaining lymphocytes, necessitating the development of novel tools to identify Kv1.3high lymphocytes in tissues. Despite the clear need for fluorescently labeled toxins as markers of channel expression and distribution in intact cells, there have been only a few reports of channel-binding peptides that have been successfully tagged with fluorophores. Fluorophore-labeled channel-binding peptides were reported previously for sodium channels (14Darbon H. Angelides K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6074-6084Google Scholar, 15Joe E.H. Angelides K.J. J.

Koschak A. Trieb M. Obermair G. Kaufmann W.A. Gerster U. Blanc E. Hahn C. Prinz H. Schutz G. Darbon H. Gruber H.J. Knaus H.G. Bioconjugate Chem. 2002; 13: 416-425Google Scholar, 19Freudenthaler G.

Several Kv1.3-blocking polypeptides have been discovered by us and by others (5Kalman K. Pennington M.W. Lanigan M.D. Nguyen A. Rauer H. Mahnir V. Paschetto K. Kem W.R. Grissmer S. Gutman G.A.

Because these polypeptides bind with extremely high affinities to Kv1.3, they might be used in much the same way as antibodies. Unlike Kv1.3-specific antibodies, these polypeptides bind to the outer vestibule of Kv1.3 and can therefore reach their binding pocket in live intact lymphocytes. ShK, a 35-amino acid polypeptide from the Caribbean sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus, is the most potent known inhibitor of Kv1.3 (K d 11 pm), and once bound to the channel does not wash off easily (5Kalman K. Pennington M.W. Lanigan M.D. Nguyen A. Rauer H. Mahnir V. Paschetto K. Kem W.R. Grissmer S. Gutman G.A. Christian E.P. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32697-32707Google Scholar). ShK binds via high affinity interactions to residues in the outer vestibule of the channel (5Kalman K. Pennington M.W. Lanigan M.D. Nguyen A. Rauer H.

In this study, guided by the high resolution structure of ShK (26Tudor J.E. Pallaghy P.K. Pennington M.W. Norton R.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 317-320Google Scholar, 27Norton R.S. Pallaghy P.K.

Chandy K.G. Norton R.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11963-11971Google Scholar), we attached fluorescein-6- carboxyl (F6CA) through an aminoethyloxyethyloxy-acetyl (Aeea) linker to the α-amino group of Arg1. This residue was chosen because it is located on the back side of the toxin surface facing away from the channel pore. We chose the 11-carbon atom linker Aeea to minimize steric effects caused by the aromatic moiety of F6CA in binding and folding of the peptide. The labeled polypeptide selectively blocked Kv1.3 with picomolar affinity. In flow cytometry experiments, chronically activated rat and human T lymphocytes with >600 Kv1.3 channels/cell were detected by ShK-F6CA staining, whereas resting and acutely activated lymphocytes with lower Kv1.3 channel numbers were not visualized by this method. ShK-F6CA may therefore be a useful tool to detect the presence of Kv1.3high lymphocytes under normal and diseased conditions. Guinea pig myelin basic protein (MBP), concanavalin A (Con A), cyclosporin A (CsA), and staurosporine were from Sigma. S. helianthus toxin (ShK), margatoxin (MgTX), charybdotoxin (ChTX), and apamin were from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). Tetanus toxoid (TT) was a generous gift from Dr. Peter A. Calabresi (University of Maryland). Fmoc-amino acids (Bachem A.G., CH-4416 Bubendorf, Switzerland) included the following: Ala, Arg(Pmc), Asn(Trt), Asp(OtBu), Cys(Trt), Gln(Trt), Glu(OtBu), Gly, His(Trt), Ile, Leu, Lys(Boc), Met, Phe, Pro, Ser(tBu), Thr(tBu), and Tyr(tBu). Stepwise assembly was carried out starting with 10 g of Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-resin (0.65 mmol/g) on a Labortec SP4000 peptide synthesizer. Following final removal of the Fmoc-group from the N-terminal Arg residue, a resin aliquot was removed, and the hydrophilic linker Fmoc-Aeea-OH (Fmoc-amino-ethyloxy-ethyloxyacetic acid) was coupled as an HOBT ester. This resin was subsequently divided into four portions for preparation of the biotinyl (for ShK-biotin), fluorescein-6-carboxyl (for ShK-F6CA), tetramethylrhodamine-6-carboxyl (for ShK-TMR), or the biotinyl-(Aeea)4 derivatives. Each of these residues was also coupled as an HOBT ester after deblocking the Fmoc group. Following N-terminal derivatization, each of the peptides was cleaved from the resin and simultaneously deprotected with reagent K (29King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Google Scholar) for 2 h at room temperature. The free peptide was then filtered to remove the spent resin beads and precipitated with ice-cold diethyl ether, collected on a fine filter by suction, washed with ice-cold ether, and finally extracted with 20% AcOH in H2O. Oxidative folding of the disulfide bonds and its subsequent purification were as described previously (23Pennington M. Byrnes M. Zaydenberg I. Khaytin I. de Chastonay J. Krafte D. Hill R. Mahnir V.

Oxidative folding was facilitated by addition of 1.5 mm reduced glutathione and 0.75 mm oxidized glutathione. Each sample was purified by preparative reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography using a Rainin Dynamax C18 column. High pressure liquid chromatography-pure fractions for each sample were pooled and lyophilized. Structures and purity of all analogs were confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography and amino acid and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight analysis. L929, B82, and MEL cells stably expressingmKv1.1, rKv1.2, mKv1.3,mKv3.1, and hKv1.5 have been described previously (30Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Hanson D.C. Mather R.J. Gutman G.A.

Kv1.7 currents were recorded 6–8 h after transfection. The PAS T cell line was a kind gift from Dr. Evelyne Béraud (Marseille, France). This long term cell line, specific for MBP, was generated in Lewis rats and expresses only two types of K+ channels, Kv1.3 and IKCa1 (7Beeton C. Wulff H. Barbaria J. Clot-Faybesse O. Pennington M.

Once activated with MBP and injected into naive Lewis rats, PAS T cells induce EAE (7Beeton C. Wulff H. Barbaria J. Clot-Faybesse O. Pennington M. Bernard D. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Beraud E. Proc.

They were maintained in culture by alternating rounds of antigen-induced activation and rounds of expansion in interleukin-2-containing medium. For antigen stimulation, PAS T cells (3 × 105/ml) were incubated for 2 days with 10 μg/ml MBP and 15 × 106/ml syngeneic irradiated (2500 rads) thymocytes as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in RPMI 1640 Dutch modification containing 4 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% RPMI vitamins, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (basic medium) supplemented with 1% syngeneic rat serum. For the interleukin-2-dependent growth phase, PAS cells were seeded in basic medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 5% T cell growth factor (TCGF). After 5 days of expansion in this medium, PAS T cells were restimulated with MBP. TCGF was produced by activating Lewis rat (5–8 weeks old; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) splenocytes (2 × 106/ml) with 2 μg/ml Con A in basic medium supplemented with 10% FCS. After 48 h cells were pelleted, and 15 mg/ml α-methylmannoside (Sigma) was added to the supernatant to inactivate Con A. After thorough mixing the supernatant was passed through a 0.2-μm filter and stored at −20 °C. Rat and human mononuclear cells were isolated from the spleens of Lewis rats or from the blood of healthy volunteers, and enriched for T cells by nylon wool purification for rat T cells or with CD3+RosetteSep (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) for human T cells. Rat T cells were activated with 5 μg/ml Con A; human T cells were activated with 50 ng/ml anti-CD3 Ab (Biomeda) in the presence of autologous irradiated (2500 rads) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as APCs for 48 h. Human TT or MBP-specific T cells were generated from PBMCs from a healthy volunteer. Cells (2 × 108) were stimulated with 10 μg/ml TT or MBP. After 2 days 5% TCGF was added, and the cells were expanded for 5 days. Cells were restimulated in regular 7-day cycles with TT or MBP in the presence of autologous irradiated PBMCs. Experiments were performed after the 9th stimulation when 95% of cells expressed an effector memory phenotype. All experiments were carried out in the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique with a holding potential of −80 mV. Pipette resistances averaged 1.5 megohms, and series resistance compensation of 80% was employed when currents exceeded 2 nA. Kv1.3 currents were elicited by repeated 200-ms pulses from −80 to 40 mV, applied every 30 s. Kv1.3 currents were recorded in normal Ringer solution with a calcium-free pipette solution containing (in mm): 145 KF, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, pH 7.2, 300 mOsm. Whole-cell conductances were calculated from the peak current amplitudes at 40 mV, and Kv1.3 channel numbers per cell were calculated by dividing the whole-cell conductance by the single-channel conductance (12 pS). Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.4, Kv1.5, Kv1.7, Kv3.1 and IKCa1 currents were measured as described previously (7Beeton C. Wulff H. Barbaria J. Clot-Faybesse O. Pennington M. Bernard D. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G.

Adherent L929 (Kv1.1 and Kv1.3), B82 (Kv1.2), and LTK (Kv1.4) cells were detached from culture flasks with trypsin-EDTA. Detached cells or suspension cells (lymphocytes or MEL cells expressing Kv1.5) were washed twice with PBS and incubated in the dark at room temperature with 10 nm ShK-conjugate in PBS + 2% goat serum (Sigma) for 30 min and then washed 3× with PBS + 2% goat serum before flow cytometry analysis. For ShK-biotin and ShK-(Aeea)4-biotin staining, this primary step was followed by a 30-min incubation with 2 μg/ml streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Pharmingen) or streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) and 3 washes with PBS + 2% goat serum. For competition experiments cells were preincubated with 100 nm unlabeled ShK, 1 μm MgTX, 1 μm ChTX, or 5 μmapamin before addition of 10 nm ShK-F6CA. Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD Biosciences FACScan. Data were further analyzed using CellQuest software. Rested PAS T cells were incubated with 100 nm CsA, 10 nm staurosporine, or 100 nm MgTX for 1 h. MBP and APCs were added for a further 20–30 h to activate the cells before patch clamp and flow cytometry analysis (see above). Statistical analysis was carried out using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. By using the polypeptide ShK as a template, we generated a novel fluoresceinated peptide toxin for use in flow cytometry to rapidly detect T cells that exhibit high levels of Kv1.3 channels. The parent peptide toxin ShK blocks Kv1.3 with picomolar affinity by binding to the outer vestibule of the channel, one polypeptide molecule per Kv1.3 tetramer (5Kalman K. Pennington M.W.

ShK was first assembled stepwise through solid phase synthesis (23Pennington M. Byrnes M. Zaydenberg I. Khaytin I. de Chastonay J. Krafte D. Hill R. Mahnir V. Volberg W. Gorczyca W. Kem W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1995; 346: 354-358Google Scholar). After removal of a protecting group, Arg1 of ShK was reacted with the hydrophilic linker Aeea and then coupled through this linker with F6CA (ShK-F6CA), biotin (ShK-biotin), or tetramethylrhodamine (ShK-TMR). The respective ShK-derivatives were cleaved from the resin and folded as described previously (23Pennington M. Byrnes M. Zaydenberg I. Khaytin I. de Chastonay J. Krafte D. Hill R. Mahnir V.

ShK-Arg1, the residue of which these linkers are attached (highlighted in orange) is on the “back side” of ShK (5Kalman K. Pennington M.W. Lanigan M.D. Nguyen A. Rauer H. Mahnir V. Paschetto K.

Lys22, the critical residue on the channel-binding surface of ShK that occludes the Kv1.3 channel pore (5Kalman K. Pennington M.W. Lanigan M.D. Nguyen A. Rauer H. Mahnir V. Paschetto K. Kem W.R.

The fluorophores were attached to Arg1 in order to minimize the likelihood of interference with the interaction of polypeptide with the channel. Our strategy of labeling ShK during synthesis avoided the possibility of accidental labeling the crucial ε-amino group of Lys22. ShK-F6CA, ShK-biotin, ShK-TMR, and native ShK were tested for their ability to block mouse Kv1.3 channels stably expressed in L929 cells. Kv1.3 currents were elicited by 200-ms depolarizing steps from a holding potential of −80 mV to 40 mV (Fig.2, A–E). Native ShK blocked these currents at picomolar concentrations (Fig. 2 A), and the dose-response curve shown in Fig. 2 F revealed aK d of 10 pm. ShK-F6CA (K d = 48 ± 4 pm) and ShK-TMR (52 ± 5 pm) were 4-fold less potent than ShK (Fig. 2,B, E, and F). Although the affinity of ShK-biotin for Kv1.3 (K d = 11 ± 2 pm) was comparable with that of ShK, it was completely ineffective when pre-assembled with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Fig. 2, C, D, and F), probably because the complex was too large to reach the binding site in the channel pore. Attachment of biotin via a longer linker (33 Å in length) to ShK dramatically reduced its affinity for Kv1.3 (K d >100 nm; not shown in graph). All these polypeptides blocked Kv1.3 with a Hill coefficient of 1. These results demonstrate that ShK retains its ability to block the Kv1.3 channel at picomolar concentrations after the attachment of a fluorophore to Arg1. ShK is reported to block Kv1.3 and the neuronal channel Kv1.1 with equivalent potency (5Kalman K. Pennington M.W. Lanigan M.D. Nguyen A. Rauer H. Mahnir V. Paschetto K. Kem W.R. Grissmer S. Gutman G.A. Christian E.P. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32697-32707Google Scholar). We therefore examined the ability of ShK-F6CA, ShK-TMR, ShK-biotin, and native ShK to block mouse Kv1.1 channels stably expressed in L929 cells. We used the classical K+ channel blocker, TEA as a control, because Kv1.1 is one of the most TEA-sensitive channels. As expected, Kv1.1 was potently blocked by ShK (K d = 25 ± 3 pm) (Fig.3 A) and exhibited low micromolar sensitivity to TEA (Fig. 3 B). Surprisingly, ShK-F6CA was 160-fold less effective (K d = 4.0 ± 0.3 nm) than ShK (Fig. 3 A) and showed 83-fold greater affinity for Kv1.3 over Kv1.1 (compare Fig. 2, A andF, with Fig. 3 A). In contrast, ShK-TMR and ShK-biotin blocked Kv1.1 at picomolar concentrations (ShK-TMR,K d = 397 ± 36 pm; ShK-biotin,K d = 114 ± 8 pm) and only exhibited 7–10-fold higher affinity for Kv1.3 than Kv1.1 (compare Fig.2 F and Fig. 3, B and C). The enhanced specificity of ShK-F6CA for Kv1.3 over Kv1.1 might be explained by the differences in charge of F6CA, TMR, and biotin: F6CA is negatively charged; TMR is positively charged; and biotin is neutral. In a recent experimentally determined docking configuration of ShK in the Kv1.3 vestibule (28Lanigan M.D. Kalman K. Lefievre Y. Pennington M.W. Chandy K.G. Norton R.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11963-11971Google Scholar), ShK-Arg1 was found to be in the vicinity of Asp376-Asp377-Pro377-Ser378-Ser379on the channel. If ShK sits in the Kv1.1 vestibule with the same geometry as it does in Kv1.3, the presence of three glutamates in the corresponding sequence in Kv1.1 (Glu350-Glu351-Ala352-Glu353-Ser354) could electrostatically repel the negatively charged F6CA, while not affecting ShK-biotin and possibly strengthening the interaction with ShK-TMR. Negatively charged channel residues in neighboring loops (e.g. S3–S4 and S1–S2) may also contribute to the diminished potency of ShK-F6CA for Kv1.1. We further tested the specificity of ShK-F6CA for Kv1.3 by screening it against a panel of additional KV channels that were either stably expressed in mammalian cells (mKv1.2, hKv1.4, hKv1.5, and mKv3.1) or transiently transfected (mKv1.7). ShK-F6CA, like ShK, did not block mKv1.2, hKv1.5, mKv1.7, and mKv3.1 at concentrations up to 100 nm (Table I) as expected from published reports (5Kalman"
https://openalex.org/W1966213912,"We review the origin and evolution of the heavy elements, those with atomic numbers greater than 30, in the early history of the Milky Way. There is a large star-to-star bulk scatter in the concentrations of heavy elements with respect to the lighter metals, which suggests an early chemically unmixed and inhomogeneous Galaxy. The relative abundance patterns among the heavy elements are often very different from the solar system mix, revealing the characteristics of the first element donors in the Galaxy. Abundance comparisons among several halo stars show that the heaviest neutron-capture elements (including barium and heavier) are consistent with a scaled solar system rapid neutron-capture abundance distribution, whereas the lighter such elements do not conform to the solar pattern. The stellar abundances indicate an increasing contribution from the slow neutron-capture process (s-process) at higher metallicities in the Galaxy. The detection of thorium in halo and globular cluster stars offers a promising, independent age-dating technique that can put lower limits on the age of the Galaxy."

Although additional proteins have been identified that modulate the activity of initiator caspases, the IAPs are the only cellular proteins known to control the effector stage of the caspase cascade. The IAPs are uniquely situated at this central control point and have been conserved in organisms as divergent as Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammals. The defining characteristic of an IAP is the presence of one or morebaculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains. BIR domains fold into a series of four or five α-helices and a three-stranded β-sheet with a single zinc ion coordinated by conserved cysteine and histidine residues (5Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). There are currently eight members of the mammalian IAP family of which XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2 form an obvious subgroup, each possessing three BIR domains and a carboxyl-terminal RING zinc finger motif. The RING finger domain possesses ubiquitin ligase activity, catalyzing autoubiquitination as well as ubiquitination of caspase 3 and other IAP-interacting proteins (10Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P.

Despite the similarities at the amino termini of these proteins, there is little or no homology throughout the rest of the coding sequences. Furthermore, insect IAP antagonists display this motif at their extreme amino terminus with the methionine start codon presumably removed by endogenous amino peptidases. Transcriptional regulation of the IAPs and their antagonists in insect cells determines cell fate. In contrast, the mammalian equivalents, Smac and Omi, are sequestered in an inactive state in the mitochondrial intermembrane space until an apoptotic stimulus has occurred. The consequences of Smac expression have been complicated by the absolute requirement for an alanine at the amino terminus of the mature protein. Microinjection or transfection of Smac-like peptides from the amino terminus of the mature protein recapitulate some but not all of the effects of Smac (32Srinivasula S.M. Datta P. Fan X.J.

Transfection of plasmids encoding the full-length Smac open reading frame results in the accumulation of excess Smac in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Although it has been demonstrated that Smac overexpression sensitizes cells to apoptotic triggers, such as UV light, death ligands, or chemotherapeutic drugs (33Li S. Zhao Y. He X. Kim T.-H.

One experimental approach to resolve this difficulty fused GFP to the mature Smac coding sequences with a caspase 8 cleavage site used to generate the correct AVPI-initiating mature Smac protein. TRAIL receptor engagement thus activated the GFP-Smac protein directly without a mitochondrial requirement for processing, sensitizing cells to TRAIL-induced killing (32Srinivasula S.M. Datta P. Fan X.J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Huang Z. Alnemri E.S. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36152-36157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (315) Google Scholar). As an alternative approach to dissecting the consequences of mature Smac in the cytosol of cells, we have developed a novel system using ubiquitin (Ub) fusion proteins. Ubiquitin is synthesized in cells as a precursor polyprotein in which the Ub coding region is fused to itself and to ribosomal protein subunits (for a review, see Ref. 36Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). All cells possess ubiquitin-specific proteases, which hydrolyze the isopeptide bond between Ub-Ub polymers or Ub-protein substrates. No sequence requirements are present downstream of the Ub peptide, thereby allowing the generation of any desired amino terminus for the downstream fusion partner. We thus used this system to generate mature Smac protein initiating with the correct AVPI amino terminus in the cytosol of transfected cells, bypassing the normal requirement for mitochondrial processing. The ubiquitin and mouse Smac/DIABLO coding regions were fused by an overlapping PCR strategy. The Ub coding region was amplified using the primers 5′-d-AAAAAGCTTAAAATGAGAGGCAGCCACCACCATCACCATCACATGCAGATCTTCGTG and 5′-d-CTGAGCAATAGGAACCGCACCACCTCTCAGACGCAGGAC. The Smac coding region was amplified with 5′d-CGTCTGAGAGGTGGTGCGGTTCCTATTGCTCAG and 5′-d-TACTCGAGTTAGGCGTAATCAGGGACATCGATAGGATAATCTTCACGCAGGTAGGC. Ub and Smac PCR products were denatured at 95 °C, annealed together at 50 °C, and reamplified with the Ub forward and Smac reverse primers. The Ub-Smac PCR product was TA cloned in PCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and completely sequenced. The coding region was then subcloned usingHindIII and XhoI sites into a ubiquitin C promoter-containing expression vector (courtesy of Dr. Douglas Gray, Ottawa Regional Cancer Center, Ottawa, Canada). The final plasmid construct encodes a 279-amino acid (aa) precursor protein consisting of 86 aa of human ubiquitin fused to aa residues 54–237 of mouse Smac with a 9-aa carboxyl-terminal HA tag. Primers 5′-d-CGTCTGAGAGGTGGTGCTCAGAAATCGGAGCC and 5′-d-GGCTCCGATTTCTGAGCACCACCTCTCAGACG were used to delete the AVPI codons of Ub-Smac using the QuikChangeTM Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Ub-Smac plasmid was used as a template for PCR, the product was TA cloned, sequenced, and subcloned into the ubiquitin promoter expression vector to generate Ub-ΔAVPI-Smac. Individual BIR domains of XIAP were PCR-amplified and TA cloned using the following primers: BIR1, 5′-d-CAGGATCCATGACTTTTAACAGTTTTGAAGG and 5′-d-GACTCGAGCTAGCTTCCCAGATAGTTTTCAAC; BIR2, 5′-d-CAGGATCCATGAGAGATCATTTTGCCTTAGAC and 5′-d-GACTCGAGCTATTCACTTCGAATATTAAGATTCCG; BIR3, 5′-d-CAGGATCCATGTCTGATGCTGTGAGTTCTG and 5′-d-GACTCGAGCTAAGTAGTTCTTACCAGACACTCCTCAAG. The XIAP BIR domain fragments (aa 1–123, 124–240, and 241–356) were subcloned into pGEX-4T3 using the BamHI and XhoI sites present in the primers. Human embryonic lung (HEL) 299 cells and 293A embryonic kidney cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cultures were maintained in 100-mm tissue culture grade dishes (Corning) and passaged every 72 h. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000TM(Invitrogen) as outlined in the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid DNAs were prepared using the Qiagen MaxiprepTM kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 100-mm dishes of transfected and untransfected cells were rinsed two times in PBS. 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors (10 μm aprotinin, 100 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, and 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (all from Sigma) were added to each dish, and the cell lysates were scraped into Eppendorf tubes. The lysates were then sonicated twice for 30 s each using a probe sonicator (Sonics and Materials, Inc.). Lysates were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and placed in a fresh Eppendorf tube, and the pellet was discarded. 3 μg of anti-RIAP3 (rat XIAP) were added to the supernatant, and the samples were incubated for 1 h on a rotating shaker at 4 °C. Following the 1-h incubation, 40 μl of a protein A-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) bead slurry were added to the samples. The samples were incubated for 1-h on a rotating shaker at 4 °C and then washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer. The beads were syringe-dried using a 28-gauge needle, 1× Laemmli sample buffer was added, and samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. HEL299 cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 106 cells/dish. 24 h following Ub-Smac transfection, the cells were washed two times in PBS, trypsinized, and pelleted at 1, 500 × g at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold RSB (10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and transferred to a 2-ml Dounce homogenizer. After allowing the cells to swell for 7 min, the cells were broken open with several strokes of the pestle. One-half volume 2.5× MS buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) was immediately added to give a final concentration of 1× MS, and the homogenate was mixed by inversion. The homogenate was then transferred to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and large membrane fragments. The supernatant was centrifuged one more time at 1,300 × g and then transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube. The supernatant was centrifuged at 17,000 × gfor 15 min to obtain a mitochondrial pellet. The mitochondrial pellet was washed in 1× MS buffer, and the 17,000 × gsedimentation was repeated. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in a small volume of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmEDTA). Following the first 17,000 × g centrifugation, the supernatant was processed further by ultracentrifugation (Beckman TL-100) at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. From this centrifugation the cytosolic fraction (supernatant) and light membrane fraction (pellet) were obtained. The pellet was resuspended in a small volume of TE buffer. To all samples, an appropriate volume of 4× Laemmli sample buffer was added to give a final 1× concentration. Samples were boiled 5 min prior to electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Overnight cultures of pGEX-XIAP-BIR1, -BIR2, and -BIR3 were diluted 1:10 in fresh medium and allowed to grow for 1 h prior to induction. 50 μm zinc acetate was then added to the cultures along with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cultures were induced at 28 °C for 2.5 h. Bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in STE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (10 μm aprotinin, 100 μmpepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, and 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Dithiothreitol was added to 1 mm, and the pellet was vortexed before adding 20 mg/ml lysozyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The suspension was then incubated on ice for 15 min. A 1/50 volume of 10% taurocholic acid (Calbiochem) was added along with 0.1 mmDNase (Sigma) and 0.1 mm MgCl2., and the suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min, sonicated 3 × 20 s using a probe sonicator with an amplitude of 20%, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was filtered through cheesecloth, and a 1/50 volume of 20% Triton X-100 (Sigma) was added. Glutathione-Sepharose bead slurry (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotating platform. Bead-protein complexes were collected and washed four times in NETN buffer (2 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 m NaCl, 20% Triton X-100, 0.5m EDTA). The bead complexes were then stored in 200 μl of NETN buffer and 50 μm zinc acetate until further use. GST fusion proteins were quantified by SDS-PAGE using bovine serum albumin as a protein standard prior to performing pull-down analysis. Cell lysates for pull-down analysis were prepared by lysing 100-mm dishes of untransfected, Ub-Smac-, and Ub-ΔAVPI-Smac-transfected 293A cells in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA) and protease inhibitors. Lysates were collected in Eppendorf tubes, incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 17,000 ×g for 5 min. For pull-down analysis, 100 μg of total cell lysate and 2.5 μg of GST fusion protein were mixed in an Eppendorf tube, and 500 μl of lysis buffer were added to allow for adequate mixing on a rotating shaker. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the protein-bead complexes were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer. Beads were syringe-dried and resuspended in a small volume of 1× sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. HeLa cells were plated and transfected simultaneously in 96-well dishes. Plasmid DNA (320 ng/well) was diluted in 25 μl/well Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and dispensed in 96-well plates. 0.4 μl/well LipofectAMINE 2000 was diluted in 25 μl/well OptiMEM and added to each well. HeLa cells were trypsinized, counted, and adjusted to 5 × 105 cells/ml, and 100 μl of cell suspension were added to each well. At 24 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, 10% fetal calf serum containing etoposide (Sigma) at varying doses in triplicate. Cell viability was determined 48 h postexposure to etoposide using WST-1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein samples in 1× sample buffer were electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto ImmobilonTM-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) at 15 V for 30 min using a semidry electrotransfer apparatus (Hoefer Semiphor). Blots were immediately placed into 5% skim milk in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST) and incubated overnight. This was followed by a 1-h incubation in primary antibody diluted in 2% skim milk in PBST. Blots were washed 3 × 5 min in 2% skim milk in PBST and then incubated for 1 h in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in 2% skim milk, PBST. Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) using Kodak film. Cells grown on coverslips were rinsed briefly in PBS and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. The coverslips were then rinsed 3 × 5 min in PBS, and the cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 (Pierce) for 20 min. The coverslips were again rinsed 3 × 5 min in PBS. Immunofluorescence labeling was performed sequentially at room temperature. All antibody incubations lasted 45 min with 3 × 5-min washes in PBS between each application of antibody. Following the incubation of the secondary antibody, cells were washed 3 × 5 min in PBS and then counterstained with 1 mg/ml Hoescht (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:5,000 to visualize nuclei. Cells were then washed for 30 s in PBS and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector). Immunolabeled samples were visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100-watt mercury arc lamp. Images were digitally recorded with an AxioCam CCD camera using AxioVision version 3.1 software. Anti-HSP70, a mouse monoclonal IgG specific for mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (Affinity Bioreagents Inc.), was used at 1:100 for immunofluorescence labeling and 1:200 for Western blotting. Rat monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at 1:500 for Western blotting. Mouse monoclonal anti-Smac/DIABLO (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used at 1:100 for immunofluorescence labeling and 1:500 for Western blotting. 5 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-RIAP3 were used for immunoprecipitation. Goat polyclonal anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 conjugated to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) and goat polyclonal anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 conjugated to indocarbocyanine (CY3; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) were both used at 1:400 for immunofluorescence microscopy. For Western blotting a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to HRP (Bio-Rad) was used at 1:5,000. Goat anti-rat IgG conjugated to HRP (Amersham Biosciences) was used at 1:2,000 for Western blotting. To bypass the mitochondrial requirement for Smac processing, we developed a ubiquitin fusion system. As shown schematically in Fig. 1 A, the coding region for human ubiquitin (76 codons) was fused in-frame to the 184 codons corresponding to processed, mature mouse Smac/DIABLO. In addition, a HA tag was added to the carboxyl terminus to allow distinction between the transgene-encoded and the endogenous Smac proteins. Cleavage of the 31.4-kDa precursor protein by the endogenous ubiquitin-specific proteases was predicted to occur immediately following the carboxyl-terminal Gly-Gly dipeptide of ubiquitin, generating the correct Ala-Val-Pro-Ile amino terminus of processed, cytosolic Smac. Plasmid transfection in HeLa cells resulted in the rapid and complete processing of the expressed Ub-Smac fusion protein. Unprocessed Ub-Smac (31.4-kDa) protein was not detectable by Western blot with either anti-Smac (Fig. 1 B) or anti-HA (data not shown). The endogenous Smac protein was also visible by Western blot, present in both the unprocessed, mitochondrial precursor form and the mature cytosolic form (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). In transfected cells, the processing of Ub-Smac was predicted to generate a 21.6-kDa mature Smac protein, slightly larger than the endogenous mature human Smac (due to the presence of the HA tag) but smaller than the mitochondrial Smac precursor protein. To determine whether the processed Smac protein was capable of binding to XIAP protein, we performed GST pull-down analysis. Protein lysates were prepared from Ub-Smac-transfected cells, allowed to bind to recombinant, glutathione bead-bound XIAP protein fragments, and washed extensively. Western blot analysis with anti-Smac (Fig. 1 B) or anti-HA (not shown) demonstrated that the transfected Smac protein bound to XIAP BIR3 and BIR2 but not to BIR1. Although GST pull-down analysis is not quantitative, there was an apparent and consistently observed enhanced XIAP BIR3 binding relative to BIR2 as has been described in the literature (37Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 2000; 408: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). We next confirmed interaction between XIAP and Smac in vivo. Endogenous XIAP protein was immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-RIAP3 antibody. Western blot analysis was then carried out with anti-HA. As seen in Fig.1 C, processed Ub-Smac bound to XIAP. The principal advantage of this system is the ability to express mature Smac in the cytoplasm. To confirm that the expressed Smac resides in the cytoplasm, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy. Anti-Smac immunofluorescence microscopy of untransfected cells shows a punctate staining pattern with some generalized cytoplasmic staining (Fig.2 A). We interpreted this as mitochondrial localization (as previously reported; Refs. 14Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar and15Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar) with some leakage of Smac into the cytoplasm. An antibody to mitochondrial HSP70 was then used to illustrate the mitochondrial staining pattern as seen in Fig. 2 B. Labeling of Ub-Smac-transfected cells with anti-Smac antibody showed a clearly cytoplasmic staining pattern with relatively little mitochondrial labeling due to the endogenous Smac protein (Fig. 2 C). Unfortunately the commercially available anti-HA antibodies do not function well in immunofluorescence microscopy, which would have allowed us to distinguish the Ub-Smac-derived protein from the endogenous Smac. Confirmation that the Ub-Smac-derived, mature Smac was localized to the cytoplasm was obtained by cell fractionation in which mitochondrial, cytoplasmic, and light membrane (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi) fractions were prepared. As seen in Fig. 2 D, mitochondrial HSP70 partitioned cleanly in the mitochondrial fraction, whereas the Smac protein (detected with the anti-HA antibody) localized exclusively in the cytoplasmic fraction. We next examined the contribution of the Ala-Val-Pro-Ile amino-terminal tetrapeptide of mature Smac to the Smac-XIAP interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the Ub-Smac plasmid such that the 12 nucleotides encoding the first four amino acids of mature Smac were deleted. HeLa cells were transfected with Ub-Smac and Ub-Smac-ΔAVPI expression plasmids, and expression was confirmed by both anti-Smac (not shown) and anti-HA Western blot (Fig. 3). Pull-down analysis was performed with GST-XIAP-BIR1, -BIR2, and -BIR3 recombinant proteins. As seen in"

When 5 μm N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) or 20 μm H2O2 alone induced little increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as judged by the 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate method, 20 μmH2O2 enhanced oxidative damage as judged by ROS accumulation, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance production after pretreatment with 5 μm C2-ceramide at least for 12 h. The treatment with a catalase inhibitor, 3-amino-1h-1,2,4-triazole, increased oxidative damage and apoptosis induced by H2O2, and in contrast, purified catalase inhibited the enhancement of oxidative damage by H2O2 in ceramide-pretreated cells, suggesting that the oxidative effect of ceramide is involved in catalase regulation. Indeed, C2-ceramide inhibited the activity of immunoprecipitated catalase and decreased the levels of catalase protein in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, acetyl-Asp-Met-Gln-Asp-aldehyde, which dominantly inhibited caspase-3 and blocked the increase of oxidative damage and apoptosis due to C2-ceramide-induced catalase depletion at protein and activity levels.

Thus, as it is reported that oxidative damage increases ceramide generation, and at the same time, ceramide can increase oxidative damage, these results may suggest the existence of an up-regulation mechanism between ceramide and oxidative damage through activation of caspase-3. However, although we suggested previously (11Takeda Y. Tashima M. Takahashi A. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10654-10660Google Scholar) that ROS-activated caspase-3 increased ceramide through sphingomyelinase activation, the mechanism through which ceramide-activated caspase-3 increases ROS generation is still unknown. We showed recently (34Kondo T. Suzuki Y. Kitano T. Iwai K. Watanabe M. Umehara H. Daido N. Domae N. Tashima M. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 620-627Google Scholar) that ceramide-induced oxidative damage through catalase depletion was involved in vesnarinone-induced apoptosis and that inhibition by insulin-like growth factor-1 of ceramide-induced apoptosis was because of restoring catalase activity in a caspase-3-dependent manner (35Kondo T. Kitano T. Iwai K. Watanabe M. Taguchi Y. Yabu T. Umehara H. Domae N. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 682-692Google Scholar). These results showed the intimate relation between ceramide-activated caspase-3 and catalase function in apoptosis. Therefore, it was here examined how apoptosis because of oxidative damage was enhanced by a low concentration of H2O2 in ceramide-pretreated cells and investigated through which mechanisms ceramide-activated caspase-3 depleted catalase function to induce oxidative damage and apoptosis. The results suggest that a low concentration of H2O2 enhances oxidative damage and apoptosis because of a decrease of ROS scavenging ability through ceramide-depleted catalase function, because ceramide inhibits catalase activity by increasing a proteolysis of catalase protein in a caspase-3-dependent manner. C2-ceramide, C2-dihydroceramide, and sphingosine were from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). 4′,6-Diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) and 3-amino-1h-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ) were from Nacarai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Acetyl-Asp-Met-Gln-Asp-aldehyde (DMQD-CHO) and acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD-CHO) were purchased from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan), dissolved at 10 mm in Me2SO, and stored at −80 °C. 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were from Pierce and Nakarai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), respectively. ECL Western blotting kit and [32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Purified and active caspase-3, -6, -8, and -9 were obtained from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Other chemicals, if not mentioned, were purchased from Sigma. Human myeloid leukemic cell line HL-60 was kindly provided by Dr. Saito (National Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan). The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1 μm sodium selenite, and kanamycin (80 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. A few hours prior to each experiment, the cells at an initial concentration of 1–2.5 × 105/ml were replaced into fresh media containing 2% fetal bovine serum. Production of ROS was measured with DCFH-DA, which is cell-permeable and oxidized inside the cells to fluorescent dichlorofluorescin in the presence of H2O2 (36Wang H. Joseph J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 612-616Google Scholar, 37Ubezio P. Civoli F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 509-516Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells treated with or without C2-ceramide were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and incubated with 5 μm DCFH-DA for 15 min at 37 °C. Then the cells were washed in PBS, and fluorescence was determined by using FACScan (BD Biosciences) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Generally, 10,000 events were monitored, and data analysis was performed by using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Oxidative damage was determined as the production of TBARS, according to the modified method of Ohkawaet al. (38Ohkawa H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 351-358Google Scholar). Briefly, a 200-μl homogenate of the cells was supplemented with a 650-μl mixture of TBARS and 150 μl of acetic acid buffer, vortexed on ice for 1 h and boiled at 100 °C for 1 h. The reactants were then supplemented with 1 ml of the mixture of n-butanol and pyridine, vortexed vigorously, and centrifuged for 10 min at 650 × g. Absorbance was measured at 532 nm on spectrophotometer, and the results were expressed as nmol TBARS per mg protein. Apoptosis was identified by staining the cells with DAPI or by May-Giemsa staining. The cells were washed, fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 30 min, and then labeled with 2 μg/ml DAPI. After labeling, apoptotic cells were visualized under a fluorescent microscope (BX60-34FFB1; Olympus). Morphological changes of apoptotic cells were also determined with May-Giemsa staining under microscope with a ×400 magnificent force. The cells with condensed, or fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic cells. At least 200 cells were counted in each experiment. The data show the means of at least three independent experiments. After treatment, the cells (1 × 107) were lysed in 700 μl of lysing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Endogenous caspase-3 was immunoprecipitated by 2 h of incubation with 10 μg of anti-caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-catalase (Calbiochem) at 4 °C, followed with 2 h of incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Endogenous catalase was immunoprecipitated by 2 h of incubation with 10 μg of anti-catalase antibody (Polysciences, Inc.) at 4 °C, followed with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed five times with lysis buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The cells at the concentration of 1 × 106/ml were washed with PBS twice, and after homogenization catalase was immunoprecipitated by anti-catalase or anti-MPO antibody (Calbiochem). Catalase activity was assayed by measuring the kinetic loss of H2O2 as described previously (39Beers R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Google Scholar). For catalase activity, immunoprecipitated protein was mixed with H2O2 in PBS, and loss of H2O2 monitored at 240 nm by spectrophotometer was detected as catalase activity. For MPO activity, immunoprecipitated protein was measured as described elsewhere (40Wagner B.A. Buettner G.R. Oberley L.W. Darby C.J. Burns C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22461-22469Google Scholar). The cells treated with or without C2-ceramide were lysed in a solubilizing buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.15 units/ml aprotinin for 40 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble materials. Twenty μg per lane of whole cell lysate was denatured by boiling and resolved by the SDS-PAGE method. Following electrophoresis, the gels were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. The membranes were blotted in 5% skim milk overnight and then probed with anti-catalase antibody. After subsequent incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody, expressions of protein were visualized by using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and 20 μg of total RNA was used for the Northern blotting analysis as described previously (41Kondo T. Matsuda T. Kitano T. Takahashi A. Tashima M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. Domae N. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7668-7676Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotide probes for human catalase was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a multiprime labeling kit (AmershamBiosciences). After electrophoresis and transferring RNA to Immobilon-S membrane, hybridizations with labeled catalase cDNA probes were performed at 42 °C for 24 h, and the membranes were washed in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS (1× SSC containing 0.15 m NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate) at room temperature for 30 min and at 50 °C for 20 min. The membranes were exposed to Fuji x-ray films with the intensifying screens at −80 °C and calculated by a BAS-III image analyzer. Equal loading of RNA was confirmed by the amount of β-actin mRNA detected by the above method in each-III sample. The cells after each treatment were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm pepstatin, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected as an enzyme source and added to the reaction mixture (10% sucrose, 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 μm DEVD-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin), which was followed by incubation at 25 °C for 60 min. Fluorescence was measured by a microplate reader (MTP-100F; Corona Electric) using 360-nm excitation and 450-nm emission filters. Concentrations of 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin liberated as a result of cleavage were calculated compared with standard 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin solutions. Caspase-3, -4, -6, -7, and -8 were purified as described (42Takahashi A. Hirata H. Yonehara S. Imai Y. Lee K.K. Moyer R.W. Turner P.C. Mesner P.W. Okazaki T. Sawai H. Kishi S. Yamamoto K. Okuma M. Sasada M. Oncogene. 1998; 14: 2741-2752Google Scholar). Purified caspases were incubated with indicated concentrations ofN-(acetyltyrosinylvalinyl-Nε-biotinyllysyl) aspartic acid [(2,6-dimethylbenzoyl)oxy] methyl ketone for 5 min at 37 °C. The samples were run on 16% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and stained with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin as described (43Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Google Scholar). Purified catalase (5000 units/mg protein) obtained from Calbiochem was incubated with various concentrations of purified and active caspase-3 for 2, 4, and 6 h. Then the samples in the tubes were supplemented with phosphate buffer and H2O2, and loss of H2O2 was monitored at 240 nm using a spectrophotometer as described elsewhere (39Beers R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Google Scholar). Purified catalase (1 μg) obtained from Calbiochem was incubated with 2 or 5 units of purified and active caspase-3 (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) for 4 h and then the reaction mixture was denatured by boiling in Laemmli buffer for 5 min and resolved by the SDS-PAGE method using 12.5% running gel. Following electrophoresis, the gels were silver-stained. After pretreatment with various concentrations of C2-ceramide for 12 h, 20 μm H2O2 was added and then apoptosis was examined by the DAPI method 1 or 12 h after addition of H2O2. As shown in Fig.1 A, the treatment with 20 μm H2O2 alone for 12 h slightly increased apoptosis from 4 to 8%. When the pretreatment with 2, 5, and 8 μm C2-ceramide alone for 24 h increased apoptosis from 4% to 12, 14, and 19%, respectively, addition of 20 μm H2O2 after 12 h of pretreatment with 2, 5, and 8 μmC2-ceramide increased apoptosis from 8% to 22, 34, and 48%, respectively, 24 h after treatment with C2-ceramide. The results showed that ceramide-induced apoptosis was significantly enhanced by addition of H2O2 (p < 0.01). Because the simultaneous treatment with 5 μm C2-ceramide and 20 μm H2O2 did not show the enhancement of apoptosis by H2O2 (Fig.2 B), we next examined how long the pretreatment with C2-ceramide was required for enhancing apoptosis by H2O2. The results showed that the pretreatment with C2-ceramide for 12 h was, at least, required and that for 6 h was not enough for enhancement of ceramide-induced apoptosis by H2O2 (Fig.1 B).Figure 2Enhancement of ROS generation and TBARS production by H2O2 in C2-ceramide-pretreated cells. HL-60 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of C2-ceramide (0, 2, 5, and 8 μm) for 12 h and then incubated for 1 h (A) or 12 h (B) in the presence or absence of 20 μm H2O2. Then, the fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin and oxidative damage were determined by flow cytometry (A) and TBARS production (B), respectively, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Obtained data were analyzed by Cell Quest software, and the representatives from three independent experiments are shown inpanel A. The average of three independent experiments are shown, and the bars mean one standard deviation (B). Statistical significance of TBARS production was performed by analysis of variance between treatment with C2-ceramide alone and with C2-ceramide and H2O2 (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Amount of intracellular ROS was measured by the DCFH-DA method, which is reported to be sensitive to H2O2 generation (36Wang H. Joseph J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 612-616Google Scholar, 37Ubezio P. Civoli F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 509-516Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the treatment with C2-ceramide alone for 13 h and 20 μmH2O2 for 1 h showed little increase of ROS generation (Fig. 2 A, a), although a higher concentration of 100 μm H2O2showed a prominent increase of ROS (data not shown). After the cells were pretreated with various concentrations of C2-ceramide for 12 h, ROS generation was dose-dependently increased 1 h after addition of 20 μmH2O2 (Fig. 2 A,a–d). By addition of 20 μmH2O2 for 1 h after 12 h of pretreatment with 5 μm C2-ceramide, the amount of ROS generation was increased ∼2-fold of no H2O2-added control level (Fig. 2 A,c). In addition, it was examined whether C2-ceramide-induced oxidative damage as judged by TBARS production was increased in the presence of H2O2. The treatments with 2, 5, and 8 μm C2-ceramide alone for 24 h showed the increases of TBARS production from 0.1 to 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 nmol/mg protein, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The same concentrations of C2-ceramide increased TBARS production from 0.1 to 0.8, 1.3, and 2.2 nmol/mg protein 12 h after treatment in the presence of 20 μm H2O2 for 12 h (p < 0.05 for 2 μmC2-ceramide, and p < 0.01 for 5 and 8 μm C2-ceramide; see Fig. 2 B). Although the increase of ROS generation and TBARS production by 20 μm H2O2 alone were not significantly detected 12 h after treatment, respectively, ceramide-induced ROS generation and TBARS production were enhanced by 20 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, 20 μm H2O2 seemed to increase oxidative damage in ceramide-pretreated cells, because ceramide abrogated the ROS scavenging system before H2O2 addition. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, apoptosis and oxidative damage were enhanced by 20 μm H2O2 in 5 μmC2-ceramide-pretreated cells. In these conditions, we examined whether ATZ (40 mm) or purified catalase (100 units/ml) modulated the enhancement by H2O2 of apoptosis, ROS generation, and TBARS production in ceramide-pretreated cells. The treatment with 40 mm ATZ further increased the enhancement of apoptosis by 20 μmH2O2 from 35 to 60% in the cells pretreated with 5 μm C2-ceramide whereas 100 units/ml purified catalase decreased apoptosis from 35 to 7% (Fig.3 A). Similarly, ROS generation and TBARS production enhanced by H2O2 in C2-ceramide-pretreated cells were increased approximately from a 2-fold increase to a 4-fold increase of the control level and from 1.2 to 1.7 nmol/mg protein, respectively, by ATZ (see Fig. 3,B (a and d) and C). In contrast, those were inhibited from a 2-fold increase to the control level and from 1.2 to 0.2 nmol/mg protein, respectively, by purified catalase (see Fig. 3, B (a and c) andC). In addition, ATZ, which inhibits catalase activity, seemed to mimic the effect of ceramide, because 20 μmH2O2 alone enhanced apoptosis and oxidative damage in ATZ-pretreated cells (Fig. 3). Therefore, these results suggested that ceramide inhibited the ROS scavenging system, probably catalase. The data shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and our recent reports (34Kondo T. Suzuki Y. Kitano T. Iwai K. Watanabe M. Umehara H. Daido N. Domae N. Tashima M. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 620-627Google Scholar, 35Kondo T. Kitano T. Iwai K. Watanabe M. Taguchi Y. Yabu T. Umehara H. Domae N. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 682-692Google Scholar) suggest that catalase activity is regulated downstream of proapoptotic ceramide action. We, therefore, examined whether and through which mechanisms ceramide affects the function of catalase. The activities of catalase, which was immunoprecipitated by anti-catalase antibody, were time-dependently inhibited by the treatment with C2-ceramide (Fig.4 A). By the treatment with 5 μm C2-ceramide for 12 h, catalase activity was significantly decreased from 79 units/mg protein to 70 units/mg protein (p < 0.05) and more drastically inhibited to 36 units/mg protein 36 h after treatment. These results suggested that catalase activity started to be inhibited by ceramide before the timing of H2O2 addition, which enhanced apoptosis and oxidative damage after pretreatment with ceramide at least for 12 h (see Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, immunoprecipitated MPO, which has a possibility to reduce the amount of intracellular H2O2 inhibited by ATZ, was not affected by the treatment with 5 μmC2-ceramide for 24 h (Fig.4 B). To know through which mechanisms ceramide inhibits catalase function, we examined whether catalase was depleted at mRNA or protein level by C2-ceramide. The treatment with 5 μm C2-ceramide inhibited mRNA levels of catalase in a dose- and time-dependent manner but not those of β-actin (Fig.5 A). Significant decrease of mRNA level was observed 36 h after treatment with 5 μm C2-ceramide, although decrease of catalase activity by ceramide was also detected at least 12 h after treatment (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, as shown in Fig.5 B, the protein levels of catalase were also decreased by 5 μm C2-ceramide in a time-dependent manner, and decrease of catalase protein by 5 μm ceramide was already found 12 h after treatment, which was earlier than that at mRNA level (Fig. 5,A and B), suggesting that ceramide-induced inhibition of catalase at protein level was not mediated by the decrease of catalase at mRNA level. We next examined whether caspase-3 was involved in the enhancement by H2O2 of apoptosis and oxidative damage in ceramide-pretreated cells. In the presence of 200 μm DMQD-CHO, which was designed from a cleavage site of protein kinase δ by caspase-3 and shown to be a caspase-3-dominant inhibitor (TableI) (34Kondo T. Suzuki Y. Kitano T.

https://openalex.org/W1991754704,"The Drosophila melanogaster genome contains three putative glucuronyltransferases homologous to human GlcAT-I and GlcAT-P. These enzymes are predicted to be β1,3-glucuronyltransferases involved in the synthesis of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-protein linkage region of proteoglycans and the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope of glycoproteins, respectively. The genes encode active enzymes, which we have designated DmGlcAT-I, DmGlcAT-BSI, and DmGlcAT-BSII (where BS stands for “broadspecificity”). Protein A-tagged truncated soluble forms of all three enzymes efficiently transfer GlcUA from UDP-GlcUA to the linkage region trisaccharide Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl. Strikingly, DmGlcAT-I has specificity for Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl, whereas DmGlcAT-BSI and DmGlcAT-BSII act on a wide array of substrates with non-reducing terminal β1,3- and β1,4-linked Gal residues. Their highest activities are obtained with asialoorosomucoid with a terminal Galβ1–4GlcNAc sequence, indicating their possible involvement in the synthesis of the HNK-1 epitope in addition to the GAG-protein linkage region. Galβ1–3GlcNAc and Galβ1–3GalNAc, disaccharide structures widely found in N- andO-glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids, also serve as acceptors for DmGlcAT-BSI and -BSII.

Thus, all three glucuronyltransferases are likely involved in the synthesis of the GAG-protein linkage region in Drosophila, and DmGlcAT-BSI and -BSII appear to be involved in various GlcUA transfer reactions for the synthesis of proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. This activity distinguishes these glucuronyltransferases from their mammalian homologs GlcAT-P and GlcAT-D (or -S). Sequence alignment of the Drosophila glucuronyltransferases with homologs in human, rat, and Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrates the conservation of a majority of the critical amino acid residues in the active sites of the three Drosophila enzymes.

PGs consist of a core protein and sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains. PGs can be classified into three groups based on the nature of their GAGs: heparan sulfate (HS)-type PGs, chondroitin sulfate (CS)-type PGs, and keratan sulfate PGs. There is increasing evidence that uniquely sulfated domain structures of GAG side chains are critically involved in various functions of these PGs (3Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U.

HS and CS chains are polymerized as relatively simple structures composed of repeating disaccharide units, -4GlcNAcα1–4GlcUAβ1- and -3GalNAcβ1–4GlcUAβ1-, by HS polymerases (15Lind T. Tufaro F.

These structures are further modified by the cooperative action of specific epimerases and sulfotransferases to produce mature, biologically active chains (reviewed in Ref. 18Habuchi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 115-127Google Scholar). The synthesis of the linkage region is initiated by the addition of a Xyl residue by xylosyltransferase (19Gotting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 304: 517-528Google Scholar) from UDP-Xyl to specific serine residues, followed by sequential additions of two Gal residues from UDP-Gal by galactosyltransferases I (20Okajima T. Yoshida K. Kondo T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22915-22918Google Scholar, 21Almeida R. Levery S.B. Mandel U. Kresse H. Schwientek T. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol.

The reaction is completed by a GlcUA transfer from UDP-GlcUA catalyzed by glucuronyltransferase I (GlcAT-I) (reviewed in Ref. 4Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Google Scholar). GlcAT-I was the first member cloned by degenerate PCR using primers derived from the conserved domain sequences of glucuronyltransferase P (GlcAT-P) (23Kitagawa H. Tone Y. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6615-6618Google Scholar) required for the addition of GlcUA to the terminal Galβ1–4GlcNAc- sequence of glycoprotein oligosaccharides, producing the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope precursor sequence GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc-. The trisaccharide sequence then serves as the acceptor site for the 3-O-sulfotransferase (24Ong E. Yeh J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Google Scholar, 25Bakker H. Friedmann I. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Nifant'ev N. Schachner M. Mantei N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29942-29946Google Scholar) that subsequently generates the HNK-1 epitope. Both GlcAT-I and GlcAT-P are β1,3-glucuronyltransferases and share a high degree of homology. They form a unique gene family that apparently plays several critical roles during development. GlcAT-I is constitutively expressed in all tissues, being consistent with the wide distribution and a huge array of biological functions of GAGs (3Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Google Scholar). In contrast, GlcAT-P is specifically expressed in neural cells (26Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Google Scholar), possibly reflecting a specific role in neural development. Although it seems that in mammals, GlcAT-I and GlcAT-P play specific roles in the synthesis of PGs and glycoproteins, respectively, overexpression of GlcAT-I can produce the HNK-1 epitope in mammalian cells (27Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Imiya K. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 415-420Google Scholar, 28Wei G. Bai X. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7857-7864Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains obscure whether there is some overlap between their specificities. The presence of GAGs, including HS, CS, and nonsulfated chondroitin, have been demonstrated in the invertebrate organisms Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans (29Yamada S. Van Die I. Van den Eijnden D.H. Yokota A. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 327-331Google Scholar, 30Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Google Scholar). Furthermore, use of a conventional linkage region tetrasaccharide sequence was recently established for these invertebrate GAG chains (31Yamada S. Okada Y. Ueno M. Iwata S. Deepa S.S. Nishimura S. Fujita M. Van Die I. Hirabayashi Y. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31877-31886Google Scholar), suggesting that their fundamental structures and biosynthetic mechanisms are similar to the mammalian GAG chains. A single syndecan and two glypicans, all of which are HSPGs whose mammalian homologs function as a receptor or co-receptor for extracellular effector molecules, have been identified in Drosophila (32Spring J. Paine-Saunders S.E. Hynes R.O. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3334-3338Google Scholar, 33Filmus J. Selleck S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 497-501Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that these GAGs play critical roles in development through the mediation of signaling processes of various morphogens such as decapentaplegic, Hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor, and Wingless (6Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Google Scholar). Also in C. elegans, defects in galactosyltransferase I (21Almeida R. Levery S.B. Mandel U. Kresse H. Schwientek T. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26165-26171Google Scholar, 22Bai X. Zhou D. Brown J.R. Crawford B.E. Hennet T. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48189-48195Google Scholar) and GlcAT-I (34Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Waldrip W.R. Esko J.D. Robbins P.W. Selleck S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 98: 7176-7181Google Scholar), which are involved in the synthesis of the linkage region tetrasaccharide, cause morphological abnormality such as squashed vulva. Drosophila mutants defective in the synthesis of GAGs, especially HS chains (35Binari R.C. Staveley B.E. Johnson W.A. Godavarti R. Sasisekharan R. Manoukian A.S. Development. 1997; 124: 2623-2632Google Scholar, 36Haecker U. Lin X. Perrimon N. Development. 1997; 124: 3565-3573Google Scholar, 37Lin X. Perrimon N.

Invest. 2001; 108: 497-501Google Scholar), also show severe morphological abnormality. The HNK-1 glycoepitope has been demonstrated in Drosophila(40Dennis R.D. Martini R. Schachner M. Cell. Tissue Res. 1991; 265: 589-600Google Scholar), and its critical roles in the fasciculation and pathfinding in the developing nerve were recently reported for embryonic zebrafish (39Becker T. Becker C.G. Schachner M. Bernhardt R.R. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 37-49Google Scholar). Although targeted deletion of the GlcAT-P gene in mice was recently reported to cause deficiency of the HNK-1 antigen and attenuation of the brain function (41Miyamoto M. Asano M. Sakagami J. Sudo K. Iwakura Y. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27227-27231Google Scholar), no relevantDrosophila mutant has been reported despite a large panel of existing mutants (40Dennis R.D. Martini R. Schachner M. Cell. Tissue Res. 1991; 265: 589-600Google Scholar). Here, we report our identification of three GlcAT-I homologs in the D. melanogaster genome and our biochemical characterization of the expressed enzymes. All three proteins appear to be involved in the synthesis of the GAG-protein linkage region. However, two enzymes have broader specificity toward the linkage region, the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope and glycosphingolipids. UDP-[U-14C]GlcUA (285.2 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled UDP-GlcUA, Galβ1–3GlcNAc, and Galβ1–3GalNAc were obtained from Sigma. N-Acetyllactosamine and lactose were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl was a gift from Dr. Nancy B. Schwartz (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). Asialoorosomucoid was prepared as described previously (42Kawasaki T. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6536-6543Google Scholar). β-Glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31), homogeneously purified fromAmpullaria (freshwater apple shell) hepatopancreas, was obtained from Tokyo Zouki Chemical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). A SuperdexTM Peptide HR10/30 column and IgG-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The amino acid sequence of human GlcAT-I was used for BLASTP search of GenBankTM and the homepage of the BerkeleyDrosophila Genome Project (www.fruitfly. org), which identified three putative glucuronyltransferases. Their GenBankTM accession numbers are CAA21824, AAF50082 (the CG6207 gene product), and AAF52795 (the CG3881 gene product) in the order of higher homology to human GlcAT-I, which were tentatively named CAA21824, CG6207, and CG3881. The corresponding DrosophilaEST clones were purchased from Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). The mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS/IP was generated as described previously (10Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Google Scholar). The truncated form of CAA21824, lacking the amino-terminal 27 amino acids, was amplified by PCR with the cDNA from the Drosophila EST clone GH05057 using a 5′-primer (5′-CGGGATCCAACGGGAAGCGCACATGCC-3′) containing an in-frame BamHI site and a 3′-primer (5′-CGGGATCCTTAGACCTCCATGCCGCC-3′) containing aBamHI site just after the stop codon. The soluble form of CG3881, lacking the first 61 amino acids, was amplified with the obtained cDNA from the GH22332 clone as a template using a 5′-primer (5′-ATGGATCCGTTCACATATGCAGCGAGAGTT-3′) containing an in-frame BamHI site and a 3′-primer (5′-ATGGATCCGTGGATTCGAGATTTGTTTTAG-3′) containing aBamHI site located 59 base pairs downstream of the stop codon. The soluble form of CG6207, lacking the first 59 amino acids at the amino-terminal end, was amplified with the plasmids from RE26967 using a 5′-primer (5′-CGGGATCCTTCGCCGCCAGCGAGGTTGT-3′) containing an in-frame BamHI site and a 3′-primer (5′-CGGGATCCACGGCGAGCTCCTTGCTAAT-3′) containing aBamHI site at 28 base pairs downstream of the stop codon. All the polymerase chain reactions were carried out usingPfu polymerase (Promega). The amplified fragments were digested with BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of pEF-BOS/IP, resulting in fusion proteins with a cleavable insulin signal sequence for secretion and protein A for purification of the expressed fusion proteins. The respective expression vector (6.7 μg) was introduced into COS-1 cells using FuGENETM 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the provided instructions. The transfected cells were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h, and a 1-ml aliquot of the culture medium was used for incubation with 10 μl of an IgG-Sepharose suspension for 2 h at 4 °C. The enzyme-bound beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed with and suspended in the assay buffer for enzyme assay. A glucuronyltransferase assay mixture contained 10 μl of the resuspended IgG-Sepharose beads, 50 mm MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.5, 171 μm ATP, 10 mm MnCl2, 14.3 μmUDP-[14C]GlcUA (1.1 × 105 dpm), and 1 nmol of each acceptor in a total volume of 30 μl. The tested acceptors were Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl, N-acetyllactosamine, lactose, Galβ1–3GlcNAc, Galβ1–3GalNAc, and asialoorosomucoid (Galβ1–4GlcNAc-R, where R represents the remainder of theN-linked oligosaccharide chain). All the reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 or 37 °C. The radiolabeled product obtained with asialoorosomucoid was separated from the donor UDP-[14C]GlcUA by gel filtration on a SuperdexTM Peptide column. The isolation of the14C-labeled products obtained with the other acceptor substrates was carried out by applying the reaction mixtures on to Pasteur pipette columns packed with Dowex 1-X8 (a PO 42− form, 100–400 mesh; Bio-Rad), which selectively removed the unused UDP-[14C]GlcUA (27Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Imiya K. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 415-420Google Scholar). All the isolated products were quantified in a liquid scintillation counter (TRI-CARB 2900TR, Packard Co.) using a scintillation fluid containing 1.2% (w/v) 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 33% (w/v) Triton X-100. The reaction products obtained with two different acceptors, Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl and asialoorosomucoid, were characterized by β-glucuronidase digestion. Isolation of the products from the reaction mixtures was carried out as described above. The individual isolated products were digested with 20 milliunits ofAmpullaria β-glucuronidase in a total volume of 20 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5, at 37 °C overnight and then analyzed by gel-filtration chromatography on a SuperdexTM Peptide column. ADrosophila Rapid-ScanTM gene expression panel purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD) provides a semiquantitative method for determining the Drosophila gene expression level. The panel contained first strand cDNAs from different Drosophila tissues and developmental stages, which have been normalized against the RP49 transcript, the mRNA encoding a constitutively expressed ribosomal protein. The following primer pairs for each gene were used to amplify DNA fragments of 639, 497, and 715 bp, respectively: a 5′-primer (5′-CGGTTTTTACCAACTGCC-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-GAATGCCTCCTACCGTGAT-3′) for CAA21824, a 5′-primer (5′-GTTGTACGATTCCTGGACTC-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-AGCGAGCAGTGGATTCGAGA-3′) for CG3881, and a 5′-primer (5′-ATGAAGGGCGGCAACTACAC-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-AGAACTTGACGCTCACTGC-3′) for CG6207. PCR was carried out, with Taq polymerase (Promega), under the conditions described in the provided protocol, pre-denaturing at 94 °C for 3 min, and 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. BLASTP analysis of the D. melanogaster genome, using the amino acid sequence of human GlcAT-I, identified three putative glucuronyltransferases (CAA21824, CG6207, and CG3881). These three predicted proteins consisted of 313, 479, and 443 amino acid residues, respectively. To determine whether they are expressed inDrosophila, RT-PCR was carried out usingDrosophila embryonic mRNA (BD Biosciences) as a template, and the individual amplified fragments of putative full-lengths were cloned into a pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega) for sequence analysis. The sequencing results suggested that all three glucuronyltransferase-like proteins are expressed inDrosophila; however, the GenBankTM sequences include an intronic sequence. To obtain more detailed sequence information for the mature mRNAs, in particular for 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, a panel of corresponding EST clones were purchased and their sequences were determined. Using the combined sequence information, mRNA sequences without intron sequences were generated, resulting in proteins with slightly reduced sizes. A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis suggested that all of these proteins have type II transmembrane topology typical of endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi resident glycosyltransferases. The three putative glucuronyltransferases of the corrected sequences derived from CAA21824, CG3881, and CG6207 were designated DmGlcAT-I, DmGlcAT-BSI, and DmGlcAT-BSII, respectively, based on their homology to mammalian GlcAT-I and the broad specificity for the acceptor recognition of the others (see below). The cDNA of DmGlcAT-I, derived from EST clone GH05057, consisted of an open reading frame encoding 306 amino acid residues with an NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail of 9 residues, a putative transmembrane domain of 17 residues, and one potentialN-glycosylation site (Fig. 1). The cDNA of DmGlcAT-BSI derived from EST clone GH22332 was predicted to encode 366 residues with an NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail of 9 amino acid residues and a putative transmembrane domain of 22 amino acid residues and three potentialN-glycosylation sites (Fig.2). The DmGlcAT-BSII cDNA was obtained from EST clone RE26967 and encoded 316 amino acid residues with a relatively long NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail of 35 residues, a putative transmembrane domain of 15 residues, and two potential N-glycosylation sites, although another potential initiation codon predicted a 9-residue cytoplasmic tail (Fig.3).Figure 2Structure of DmGlcAT-BSI cDNA.

Two potential N-glycosylation sites are marked by asterisks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Using the ClustalW alignment method from the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) homepage, multiple sequence alignment for the reported glucuronyltransferases was performed. Fig.4 A shows the aligned sequences of the three Drosophila proteins and the glucuronyltransferases from human, rat, and C. elegans. SQV-8 is orthologous to C. elegans GlcAT-I and possesses a functional enzyme activity (34Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Waldrip W.R. Esko J.D. Robbins P.W. Selleck S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 98: 7176-7181Google Scholar, 45Herman T. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 974-979Google Scholar). DmGlcAT-I, DmGlcAT-BSI, and DmGlcAT-BSII showed 36–40, 27–30, and 28–30% identities, respectively, to mammalian glucuronyltransferases and 24–35% amino acid identity to one another. Interestingly, DmGlcAT-I showed much higher homology (39%) to SQV-8 (C. elegans GlcAT-I) than the other two homologs: CG6207 (27%) and CG3881 (25%), suggesting that DmGlcAT-I might be a GlcAT-I ortholog inDrosophila. This idea was also supported by the phylogenetic tree generated using the whole amino acid sequences of these proteins, in which DmGlcAT-I was grouped together with human GlcAT-I, whereas DmGlcAT-BSI and DmGlcAT-BSII were separately categorized (Fig.4 B). To determine whether the three predicted proteins are functional glucuronyltransferases, their putative catalytic domains were expressed as chimeric proteins fused to an IgG-binding domain of bacterial protein A. The secreted proteins were purified with IgG-Sepharose beads to eliminate endogenous glycosyltransferases, and the enzyme-bound beads were subjected to glucuronyltransferase assays. When the linkage trisaccharide Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl, an authentic substrate for GlcAT-I, was used as an acceptor and UDP-GlcUA as a donor substrate, significant GlcUA transferase activities were detected for all three proteins (Table I). Although DmGlcAT-I showed a relatively low efficiency compared with DmGlcAT-BSI and DmGlcAT-BSII, it did not utilize any other acceptor substrates, showing strict acceptor specificity toward Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl. In this regard, DmGlcAT-I resembled human GlcAT-I. Interestingly, unlike the other two enzymes, DmGlcAT-I showed no detectable GlcAT-I activity at 37 °C. Accordingly, although DmGlcAT-BSI and DmGlcAT-BSII showed their highest activities at 37 °C, all the enzyme activities were measured at 25 °C for comparison, which would be closer to the body temperature of Drosophila.Table IComparison of the acceptor substrate specificity of truncated forms of the three Drosophila glucuronyltransferasesAcceptorActivity1-aThe enzyme assays were carried out at 25 or 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the enzyme activities measured at 37 °C are shown in parentheses.

These reactions are considered to represent the glucuronyltransferase reaction involved in the synthesis of the nonsulfated precursor for the 3-O-sulfated GlcUA-containing HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope on glycoproteins (26Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Google Scholar). In addition, DmGlcAT-BSI and DmGlcAT-BSII could utilize Galβ1–3GalNAc, Galβ1–3GlcNAc, and lactose (Galβ1–4Glc), with the highest activity toward Galβ1–3GalNAc. The trisaccharide sequence GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3GalNAc of one of these products has been reported for glycosphingolipids in three dipterans including D. melanogaster (48Sugita M. Itonori S. Inagaki F. Hori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15028-15033Google Scholar, 49Weske B. Dennis R.D. Helling F. Keller M. Nores G.A. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Dabrowski U. Wiegandt H. Eur. J.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 3549-3558Google Scholar), indicating that the detected glucuronyltransferase activity is involved in the synthesis of acidic glycosphingolipids as well. Trisaccharide sequences of the reaction products, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3GlcNAc and GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc, have not been reported so far. These findings indicate that DmGlcAT-BSI and DmGlcAT-BSII have a broad spectrum in their substrate specificity, which clearly distinguishes these enzymes from DmGlcAT-I. It should be noted that none of the three glucuronyltransferases transferred GlcUA from UDP-GlcUA to eitherN-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides with terminal GlcNAc (16Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K.

https://openalex.org/W2061367467,"CD44 is a principal cell-surface receptor for hyaluronan (HA). Up-regulation of CD44 is often associated with morphogenesis and tumor invasion. On the contrary, reduction of cell-cell adhesion due to down-regulation of E-cadherin is associated with the invasive and metastatic phenotype of carcinomas. In our current study, we investigated the functional relationship between CD44 and E-cadherin. We established an inverse correlation between CD44 and E-cadherin indicating that the cells expressing higher levels of E-cadherin display weaker binding affinity between CD44 and HA. By using TA3 murine mammary carcinoma (TA3) cells, which display CD44-dependent HA binding, branching morphogenesis, and invasion, we demonstrated an inverse functional relationship between CD44 and E-cadherin by transfecting exogenous E-cadherin into the cells. Our results showed that increased expression of E-cadherin in TA3 cells, but not ICAM-1, weakens the binding between CD44 and HA and blocks spreading of the cells on HA substratum and CD44-mediated branching morphogenesis and tumor cell invasion. The results reported here demonstrated for the first time that E-cadherin negatively regulated CD44-HA interaction and CD44 function and suggested that balanced function of CD44 and E-cadherin may be essential for normal epithelial cell functions, and imbalanced up-regulation of CD44 function and/or down-regulation of E-cadherin function likely contributes to tumor progression."

Ca2+ binding causes structural changes between cTnC and two critical regions of cardiac muscle troponin I (cTnI): the regulatory region (cTnI-R, residues 150–165) and the inhibitory region (cTnI-I, residues130–149). These changes are associated with a decreased cTnI affinity for actin and a heightened affinity for cTnC. Using Förster resonance energy transfer, we have measured three intra-cTnI distances in the deactivated (Mg2+-saturated) and Ca2+-activated (Ca2+-saturated) states in reconstituted binary (cTnC-cTnI) and ternary (cTnC-cTnI-cTnT) troponin complexes. Distance A (spanning cTnI-R) was unaltered by Ca2+. Distances B (spanning both cTnI-R and cTnI-I) and C (from a residue flanking cTnI-I to a residue in the center of cTnI-R) exhibited Ca2+-induced increases of >8 Å. These results compliment our previous determination of the distance between residues flanking cTnI-I alone. Together, the data suggest that Ca2+activation causes residues within cTnI-I to switch from a β-turn/coil to an extended quasi-α-helical conformation as the actin-contacts are broken, whereas cTnI-R remains α-helical in both Mg2+- and Ca2+-saturated states. We have used the data to construct a structural model of the cTnI inhibitory and regulatory regions in the Mg2+- and Ca2+-saturated states.

Troponin is composed of the three subunits: a Ca2+-binding subunit (TnC), an inhibitory subunit (TnI), which when bound to actin, inhibits myosin ATPase and force generation in relaxed muscle, and a tropomyosin-binding subunit (TnT). Cardiac muscle activation is initiated by the binding of Ca2+ to the single N-domain regulatory site of cTnC. This binding causes structural changes between cTnC and two critical regions of cTnI: the regulatory region (cTnI-R, residues 150–165) and the inhibitory region (cTnI-I, residues 130–149). During activation, cTnI-I dissociates from actin and associates with cTnC (1Perry S.V. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Google Scholar), and cTnI-R associates with an activation-exposed hydrophobic patch in the N-domain of cTnC (2Solaro R.J. Rarick H.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 471-480Google Scholar). These changes, together with movement of tropomyosin on the thin filament (3Craig R. Lehman W. Thomas D.D. dos Remedios C.G. Molecular Interactions of Actin. Springer, Berlin2002: 149-165Google Scholar) and changes in actin structure and dynamics (4Thomas D.D. Prochniewicz E. Roopnarine O. Thomas D.D. dos Remedios C.G. Molecular Interactions of Actin. Springer, Berlin2002: 7-19Google Scholar), switch on the thin filament, permitting actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling and force development. Numerous studies have elucidated Ca2+-induced structural changes between TnI and the other thin filament proteins (5Miki M. Thomas D.D. dos Remedios C.G. Molecular Interactions of Actin. Springer, Berlin2002: 191-203Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi T. Kobayashi M. Collins J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1549: 148-154Google Scholar). Less is known about Ca2+-induced structural changes within TnI itself. We recently reported that in fully reconstituted cTn, Ca2+ binding to cTnC causes a 9-Å increase in the length of cTnI-I (7Dong W.J. Xing J. Robinson J.M. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 51-61Google Scholar). This large extension of the inhibitory region apparently pulls this region away from actin and facilitates movement of the adjacent regulatory region toward the N-domain of cTnC. In the present study, we have extended the previous work by examining the potential for Ca2+-induced conformational changes within the regulatory region and between the regulatory and inhibitory regions. We conclude that internal structural changes in cTnI are confined to the inhibitory region, but the cTnI-I internal changes cause the adjoining regulatory region to be displaced as a rigid body. Wild type recombinant chicken slow skeletal TnC (identical in sequence to mouse cTnC) and an adult rat cTnT mutant, in which both endogenous tryptophan at positions 237 and 288 were converted into phenylalanine, were overexpressed inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen) and purified as previously described (7Dong W.J. Xing J. Robinson J.M. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 51-61Google Scholar, 8Dong W.J. Xing J. Villain M. Hellinger M. Robinson J.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31382-31390Google Scholar, 9She M. Dong W.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 600-607Google Scholar). Three constructs of mouse cTnI each containing a single tryptophan and a single cysteine were generated: 129W/160C, cTnI(129W/167C), and cTnI(150W/167C). In these cTnI mutants, the endogenous Trp192 was changed to Phe and the two endogenous Cys81 and Cys98 were mutated to Ser and Ile, respectively. Construction of cTnI mutant clones, protein expression, purification, and characterization of the expressed proteins were as described (10Dong W.J. Chandra M. Xing J. Solaro R.J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6745-6753Google Scholar). The single-cysteine cTnI mutants were labeled with 5-(iodoacetamidoethyl)aminonaphthelene-1-sulfonic acid in the presence of 6 m urea (11She M. Xing J. Dong W.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 445-452Google Scholar). The degree of labeling was found to be >0.97 mol of probe/mol of protein. Binary (cTnC-cTnI) and ternary (cTnC-cTnI-cTnT) troponin complexes were reconstituted by incubation at 4 °C for 12 h in the presence of 6 murea, 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm Ca2+ at a ratio of [cTnI]:[cTnC] = 1:3 for the binary complexes and [cTnI]:[cTnT]:[cTnC] = 1:1.2:3 for the ternary complexes. The samples were brought to working buffer conditions (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.15 m KCl) through a series of dialysis steps as described (12Dong W.J. Wang C.K. Gordon A.M. Rosenfeld S.S. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19229-19235Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method. Mutant function was assessed through Ca2+ titrations performed on the binary complexes. The measurements yielded pCa50 values of 6.19 and 6.12 for cTnI mutants cTnI(129W/160C) and cTnI(129W/167C), respectively. These values were similar to those previously reported with wild type cTnI (8Dong W.J. Xing J. Villain M. Hellinger M. Robinson J.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31382-31390Google Scholar). Steady-state fluorescence measurements were carried out at 20 ± 0.1 °C on an ISS PC1 photon-counting spectrofluorometer, using a 2-nm band pass on both the excitation and emission monochromators (7Dong W.J. Xing J. Robinson J.M. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 51-61Google Scholar). The emission spectra were corrected for variation of the detector sensitivity with wavelength and for sample scattering. The spectral measurements were collected using 5 μm protein samples. Ca2+ saturation (2 mm total Ca2+) was achieved by addition from a 0.1 m CaCl2 stock solution. Quantum yields of tryptophan residues were obtained by comparison with known values as described (13She M. Dong W.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1042-1055Google Scholar). Time-resolved fluorescence intensity and anisotropy decays were measured at 20 ± 0.1 °C with an IBH 5000 photon-counting lifetime system equipped with a very stable flash lamp operated at 40 kHz in 0.5 atm of hydrogen. FRET measurement requires data collection from donor-only and donor-acceptor samples. For both, fluorescent emission from the donor was collected into 1,024 channels of a multichannel analyzer. Donor-only and donor-acceptor data were obtained under identical experimental conditions. Donor-only decays were analyzed as a sum of exponential terms. Donor-acceptor decays were analyzed as a static Gaussian distribution of distances using the subroutine GAUDIS in the package CFS_LS (cfs.umbi.umd.edu/cfs/software/index.html) (11She M. Xing J. Dong W.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 445-452Google Scholar, 14Dong W.J. Chandra M. Xing J. She M. Solaro R.J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6754-6761Google Scholar). The reduced chi squares ratio (χR2) was used to judge goodness of fit for the distribution. Anisotropy decays of both donor and acceptor were determined by measuring the emission polarized in the vertical and horizontal directions with vertically polarized excitation. The polarized decay data were fitted to a biexponential function to recover the limiting anisotropy at zero time (13She M. Dong W.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1042-1055Google Scholar). For all time-resolved FRET measurements, the donor, tryptophan, was selectively excited at 295 nm, and its emission was collected near its 333 nm maximum with a 340-nm interference filter. For all of the samples, the acceptor, when present, was the extrinsic fluorophore AEDANS covalently linked to a single cysteine residue. AEDANS maximum absorbance is near 340 nm. Its emission maximum is near 480 nm. The donor-acceptor overlap integral was determined for each probe pair under each experimental condition. The overlap integrals and the donor-only quantum yields enabled calculation of the Förster distance (R o) for each experimental condition (Mg2+-saturating, Ca2+-saturating, and denatured). Both the Mg2+ and the Ca2+ models had a total of 14 rigid pseudoatoms. The models were optimized using 100,000 steps of rigid body Monte Carlo with simulated annealing from 400 to 0 K. The force field consisted of bonds between successive residues, a volume exclusion term, and a term to represent the FRET distances. Bond potential energies were calculated usingEijb= k b(r ij −d b)2, where k b is the force constant (200 kcal/mol/Å2), r ijis the distance between atoms i and j, andd b is the optimal bond length (3.79 Å). The potential energy for the volume exclusion term was expressed byEijnb= k nb(r ij −d nb)2, if r ij <d nb, orEijnb= 0, where k nb is the nonbonded force constant (50 kcal/mol/Å2) and d nb is the nonbonded contact distance (3.79 Å). Long range distance constraints based on FRET measurements were expressed by the following equation. Efret={kfret(d−dlow)2dlow>d 0dlow>d>dhighkfret(d−dhigh)2d>dhighEquation 1 where d low = d obs− δ and d high = d obs + δ, and k fret was set to 20 kcal/mol/Å2. d obs is the observed FRET distance + 4 Å (to correct for probe-Cα offset) (see TableIII), and δ was set to 1.5 Å for distances B and C and to 0 for the shorter and more reliably measured distance D. For the Ca2+-saturated distance B, no upper bounds were set (k fret = 0). Mg2+- and Ca2+-saturated models were optimized to near zero energy. The reported models are representative of three different energy-minimized structures.Table IIcTnI FRET distancesSampleaDistances A, B, and C: Trp150–Cys167, Trp129–Cys167, and Trp129–Cys160, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Three intra-cTnI distances were studied (Fig. 1) in the Mg2+- and Ca2+-saturated states: distance A (residues 150–167), distance B (residues 129–167), and distance C (residues 129–160). Distance A spans the cTnI-R. Distances B spans both cTnI-R and cTnI-I. Distance C spans cTnI-I and the N-terminal 10 residues of cTnI-R. Tryptophan at residue 129 or 150 served as energy transfer donors. Cysteines at residues 160 or 167 were selectively labeled with the acceptor probe AEDANS. The steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence properties of the donor tryptophan are summarized in Table I. Trp129 emission properties were nearly equivalent in the two mutants cTnI(W129/C160) and cTnI(W129/C167) (Table I). Trp129 is sensitive to both cTnT binding and to Ca2+ addition. When denatured, the Trp129mutants had low quantum yields (0.11), and they decayed biexponentially with mean lifetimes of 3.13–3.14 ns. In working buffer, the decays were triexponential, and the mean lifetimes increased to about 4.2 ns. A small increase in quantum yield was also observed. Ca2+addition to the binary complexes increased the Trp129quantum yield by an average of 64% (0.17–0.27 for cTnI(W129,C160) and 0.16–0.27 for cTnI(W129,C167)). There were small increases in the mean lifetimes. Trp129 decayed biexponentially in ternary cTn. In the Mg2+-saturated state, cTnT increased both the quantum yields (0.17–0.22 for cTnI(W129,C160) and 0.16 to 0.23 for cTnI(W129,C167)) and the mean lifetimes (4.20–4.39 ns for cTnI(W129,C160) and 4.18–4.41 ns for cTnI(W129,C167)). These results suggest that cTnT either sterically or allosterically shields Trp129 from the solvent. Ca2+ addition to ternary cTn increased the Trp129 quantum yield to 0.31 and increased its mean lifetime to 4.62 ns in cTnI(W129/C160) and to 4.68 ns in cTnI(W129/C167). The substantial quantum yield increases, and blue spectral shifts suggest that Ca2+ addition causes the transfer of residue 129 from a partially buried to a highly buried conformation. Ca2+-induced environmental changes in cTnI Trp150 are more difficult to interpret. Ca2+binding to the binary and ternary complexes containing Trp150 produced significant blue shifts in the emission spectra. This change was in the same direction as that observed for Trp129, suggestive of a less exposed environment. However, the binding also induced decreases in the quantum yield and mean lifetime. Subsequent to Ca2+ addition, Trp150emission is likely partially quenched not by the solvent but by adjacent residues (15Vivian J.T. Callis P.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2093-2109Google Scholar). Ca2+ addition caused AEDANS-labeled cTnI160 in binary cTn to undergo a blue shift of 2.1 nm (484.4–482.3 nm) and experience an 8.6% enhanced peak intensity. As a member of the ternary cTn complex, Ca2+ addition induces a 1.9-nm blue shift and a 13% increase in maximum intensity. In contrast, AEDANS, when attached to Cys167 as a member of the binary troponin complex, undergoes a Ca2+-induced red shift of 1.4 nm (483.3–484.7 nm) and an intensity decrease of 12.3%. Similar features were observed in the ternary complex. In the presence of the dipolar solvent water, probe emission occurs from lower vibrational energy levels within the singlet excited state. Emitted photons contain less energy on average, causing an observable red shift in the emission maximum. These data indicate that Ca2+ addition causes cTnI residue 167 at the C terminus of cTnI-R to migrate from a less to a more polar environment. Ca2+ activation causes residue 160 to become buried. We have examined FRET using both steady-state and time-resolved methods. The impact of energy transfer between donor Trp129 and acceptor AEDANS attached to Cys160 (distance C) on steady-state emission spectra is shown in Fig. 2. Trp emission is observed as a peak near 330 nm. A portion of the photons absorbed by Trp is nonradiatively transferred to AEDANS. The AEDANS fluorescent emission of the transferred photons (sensitized emission) is observed as a peak near 480 nm. When denatured, donor and acceptor move apart on average, resulting in decreased transfer efficiency (Fig.2 a), because less donor energy is lost to the acceptor. The donor fluorescence increases (toward the level observed in the absence of acceptor), and the sensitized acceptor emission decreases. The addition of Ca2+ elicits an effect similar to denaturation in the binary (Fig. 2 b) and ternary (Fig. 2 c) complexes. Ca2+ increases the interprobe distance. Distance B underwent Ca2+-induced changes similar to those observed for distance C (data not shown). In contrast to the large Ca2+-induced distance changes observed for distances B and C, distance A was quite insensitive to Ca2+ (Fig.3). Distance B, which spans both cTnI-I and cTnI-R, encompasses residues in distance A (cTnI-R). The steady-state FRET data implicates cTnI-I as the region undergoing large Ca2+-elicited structural changes. The steady-state spectral data provide an initial indication of substantial Ca2+-induced conformational change in cTnI-I. Time-resolved measurements quantified these initial findings.Figure 3Steady-state fluorescence emission spectra of cTnI(150W/167C) labeled with AEDANS used to measure distance A. a, binary complex (cTnC-cTnI) in +Mg2+ buffer (solid line) and in +Ca2+ buffer (dotted line). b, ternary complex (cTnC-cTnI-cTnT) in +Mg2+ buffer (solid line) and in +Ca2+ buffer (dotted line). The conditions are the same as for Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig.4 shows the intensity decays of Trp129 used to make the distance C measurement in ternary cTn. Unless otherwise indicated, we shall confine our attention to the most physiologically relevant complex, ternary cTn. In the Mg2+-saturated state, the donor lifetime (Fig. 4,black) is appreciably quenched (Fig. 4, red) through FRET. Upon saturation with Ca2+, the donor lifetime (Fig. 4, blue) is unquenched by the acceptor (Fig. 4,magenta). Ca2+ does not appreciably alter the donor-only lifetime (Fig. 4, black versus blue). Visual inspection of the data indicates a large Ca2+-induced extension of distance C. The recovered distance distribution parameters are reported in Table II. The distribution is parametrized by a mean distance and a full width at half-maximum (half-width). The mean distance C in the Mg2+-saturated ternary complex is 24.5 Å, a distance similar to that observed in free cTnI and in the Mg2+-saturated binary complex. When the donor-acceptor probe mean distance is within the range R o = 0.5–1.5, the lifetime decay data usually contain sufficient information to resolve the first and second moments of the donor-acceptor distance distribution. Beyond this range it may be possible to recover the mean distance but with less precision. In the Ca2+-saturated case shown, the transfer efficiency is very small, and upon analysis the interprobe distance is observed to be 1.63. The half-width is unattainable. Ca2+ binding causes a 14.7 Å increase in distance C. Similar results were obtained for distance B. Upon Ca2+ saturation, the distance increased from 26.8 Å to 45.7 Å, a change of 18.9 Å. Distance A was not changed by Ca2+ addition, its value remaining near 22.7 Å. The data confirm the observations obtained from steady-state data. Ca2+ activation induces a major structural rearrangement in cTnI-I, whereas the cTnI-R is unaltered. To examine the uncertainty in the mean distance values for distances B and C, one-dimensional χR2 grid searches were performed by manually varying the distribution mean distance and minimizing around the remaining parameters (Fig.5) (16Bevington P.R. Robinson D.K. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. 2nd Ed. McGraw Hill, Boston, MA1992: 212-214Google Scholar, 17Cheung H.C. Wang C.K. Gryczynski I. Wiczk W. Laczko G. Johnson M.L. Lakowicz J.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5238-5247Google Scholar). Intersection of the curve with the 68% confidence F statistic (Fig. 5,horizontal line) determines the lower and upper error bounds for the mean distance. The surfaces are not symmetric. In the absence of bound Ca2+, the surfaces are sharp, and the mean distances can be specified to within 1-Å resolution with 68% confidence. In the presence of bound Ca2+, the surfaces are shallow, indicating poor resolution in the recovered mean distance. For both distances B and C, the upper limit on the Ca2+-saturated distance is large (distance B, 9 Å; distance C, 5 Å). To calculate the R o, a value of 2/3 was assumed for the orientation factor (κ2). This value is based on the assumption that the donor and acceptor probes tumble rapidly and randomly over the course of the measurement (dynamic averaging). One way of testing this assumption is to measure the axial depolarization factors of donor and acceptor probes (18Dale R.E. Eisinger J. Blumberg W.E. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 161-193Google Scholar). Time-resolved anisotropy decays were obtained for both donor tryptophan and acceptor AEDANS as members of the protein complexes. The limiting anisotropies of donor and acceptor were determined from the decay profiles. These values were used to calculate the depolarization factors shown in TableII. The depolarization factors of both donor and acceptor in free cTnI and in the binary and ternary complexes were similar. Ca2+had a negligible effect on the depolarization factors. These results suggest that Ca2+ binding had little effect on the orientational freedom of the probes. Full atom models of the 39-residue cTnI fragment corresponding to residues 129–167 were built using a peptide builder (Insight 2). The Ca2+-saturated state was modeled as a continuous native α-helix. The Mg2+-saturated state was represented as a α-helix (residues 1–9)/β-turn (residues 10–21)/α-helix (residues 22–39). Model residues 1–9 correspond to the N terminus of the inhibitory region (TnI-I), believed to form a stable α-helical coiled-coil with TnT (19Brown L.J. Sale K.L. Hills R. Rouviere C. Song L. Zhang X. Fajer P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12765-12770Google Scholar, 20Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 170AGoogle Scholar). Residues 10–21, corresponding to the C terminus of cTnI-I, associate with the actin filament in the Mg2+-saturated state. Model residues 22–39 encompass the regulatory region (TnI-R) that our present data (distance A) suggest is α-helical. The FRET distances obtained in this and our previous study (7Dong W.J. Xing J. Robinson J.M. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 51-61Google Scholar) were used to set long range constraints. The starting models did not meet the FRET-derived distance criteria. Reduced representation models were constructed using the computer program YAMMP (21Tan R.K. Harvey S.C. J. Comp. Chem. 1993; 14: 455-470Google Scholar), by representing amino acid residues as α-carbon-centered pseudoatoms. The models were further reduced by treating the α-helical segments 1–9 and 22–39 as rigid units. The remaining residues (residues 10–21) were treated as rigid bodies forming a random coil. Distances B, C, and D were used to impose long range energy constraints. Representative energy-minimized Mg2+- and Ca2+-saturated models are shown in Fig.6. The two states have been superimposed along the regulatory region. Table IIIshows the agreement between the FRET-derived and model-based distances. The Ca2+-dependent interaction between TnC and TnI is the key triggering step in striated muscle contraction. Despite years of intense investigation in many laboratories (22Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E.

Biol. 2000; 296: 899-910Google Scholar), the molecular details of the Ca2+-switch mechanism in cardiac troponin remain incompletely understood. To elucidate the switching mechanism, it is necessary to understand intersubunit interactions within the troponin complex as well as the conformational transitions that occur within the individual troponin subunits. We have previously reported a large Ca2+-induced extension of cTnI-I in reconstituted binary (cTnC-cTnI) and ternary (cTnC-cTnI-cTnT) complexes. We proposed that the Ca2+-induced extension of cTnI-I accommodates the movement of the adjacent cTnI-R toward the Ca2+-exposed hydrophobic patch on N-cTnC (8Dong W.J. Xing J. Villain M. Hellinger M. Robinson J.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31382-31390Google Scholar, 28Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Google Scholar). TnI-I release from actin (26Tao T. Gong B.J. Leavis P.C. Science. 1990; 247: 1339-1341Google Scholar) is apparently required for its extension. The switching mechanism therefore involves movement in TnI-I, TnI-R, and N-TnC. These structural arrangements are coupled with the transition of tropomyosin from the blocked (B) to the Ca2+-induced (C) states (29Geeves M.A. Lehrer S.S. Solaro R.J. Moss R.L. Molecular Control Mechanisms in Striated Muscle Contraction. 1. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2002: 247-269Google Scholar). The present study has focused on Ca2+-induced changes in cTnI-R itself and the relative movements between cTnI and cTnI-R. In particular, we were interested in whether Ca2+-induced cTnI conformational changes were confined to cTnI-I or extended into the adjacent cTnI-R. Three engineered FRET pairs were used to measure three different intra-cTnI distances under Mg2+- and Ca2+-saturating conditions: distance A (residues 150–167) spanned only cTnI-R, distance B (residues 129–167) spanned both cTnI-R and cTnI-I, and distance C (residues 129–160) spanned cTnI-I and the N-terminal portion of cTnI-R extending approximately to its midpoint. Distance A was unchanged by Ca2+ addition. The FRET measured mean interprobe distances (Mg2+, 22.7 Å; Ca2+, 22.6 A) were within 4 Å of the Cα-Cα distance of a 18-residue native α-helix (26.4 Å). The ∼4-Å distance difference can be attributed to donor and acceptor probe-Cα offset distances. NMR studies on the Ca2+-saturated complexes formed between N-cTnC and the cTnI-R peptide indicate that the C terminus of the peptide (residues 150–157) is unstructured (28Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Google Scholar). Our results, based on full-length cTnI, indicate that cTnI-R is α-helical throughout. This was observed in both cTnC-cTnI and cTnC-cTnI-cTnT complexes under Mg2+- and Ca2+-saturating conditions. The secondary structure of cTnI-R under Mg2+saturation has not been previously reported. An NMR study of the Ca2+-saturated cTnC-TnI-R peptide complex suggests that the central region of TnI-R binds to the N-TnC hydrophobic patch, whereas the C terminus of TnI-R extends beyond the patch in a solvent-exposed position (28Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Google Scholar). The spectral properties of AEDANS-labeled cTnI residues 160 and 167, indicating that residue 160 is buried and that residue 167 is solvent-exposed under saturating Ca2+, are compatible with this model. The spectral and quantum yield properties of AEDANS-labeled cTnI160 in the Mg2+-saturated state are similar to the solvent-exposed AEDANS-labeled Cys167 in the Ca2+-saturated state. These results suggest that the central portion of cTnI-R is unbound and solvent-exposed in the Mg2+-saturated state. We have previously reported the Ca2+-induced distance changes between 24 residues (129–152) spanning cTnI-I (distance D). The Ca2+-saturated distance D, when crudely corrected from probe-Cα offset by adding 4 Å to the FRET distance, (32.5 A), closely matches that of a 24-residue α-helix (33.7 A). The present measurements extend this work by retaining the donor position (Trp129) and placing the acceptor at residues 160 (distance C) and 167 (distance B). The large Ca2+-induced changes in distances B (18.9 Å) and C (14.7 Å) corroborate our earlier results. We have constructed a reduced representation molecular model of cTnI-I/cTnI-R in the Mg2+- and Ca2+-saturated states (Fig. 6) consistent with distances A–D (Fig. 1 and Table III). According to the model, cTnI-I/cTnI-R exists as an extended nearly continuous α-helix in the Ca2+-saturated state. The cTnI-R portion of the helix (residues 150–166) is supported by contacts with N-cTnC (28Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the N-terminal portion of cTnI-I associates with the C-domain of cTnC. This arrangement requires that the C-terminal portion of cTnI-I, which is accessible to solvent (19Brown L.J. Sale K.L. Hills R. Rouviere C. Song L. Zhang X. Fajer P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12765-12770Google Scholar), bridges the N- and C-terminal cTnC domains, running roughly anti-parallel to the cTnC linker region. In the Mg2+-saturated state, cTnI-R remains α-helical. The C-terminal portion of cTnI-I (residues 138–149) have been previously modeled as a β-turn (30Tung C.S. Wall M.E. Gallagher S.C. Trewhella J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1312-1326Google Scholar) and presently modeled as a loop. This C-TnI-I sequence has been identified as the minimum length peptide capable of inhibiting actin-myosin ATPase (31Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2798-2802Google Scholar, 32Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12374-12378Google Scholar). The N-terminal portion of cTnI-I (residues130–137) likely remains associated with cTnC in the Mg2+-saturated state. We propose that Ca2+ activation causes an internal β-turn/loop to α-helix transition in the actin-binding portion of the TnI inhibitory region. The extension in TnI-I caused by this secondary structure transition allows the TnI inhibitory region to span the TnC linker region, which is required for the adjacent TnI regulatory region to access sites on N-TnC. For ease of visualization in Fig. 6, we have aligned the Mg2+- and Ca2+-saturated models along cTnI-R, perhaps giving the impression that cTnI-R hardly moves with respect to the actin surface. This is not the case. In the model, the transition of cTnI-I from a β-turn/coil to bent α-helix is associated with a 19.7 Å increase in the intra cTnI-I/cTnI-R separation (distance B). In the intact thin filament, sTnI133 (cTnI167) is observed to move by 23.6 Å relative to actin filament, 2J. M. Robinson, W. J. Dong, and H. C. Cheung, unpublished result. and this movement is predominantly in the plane of the actin surface. N-cTnI-I is believed to remain fixed to cTnT/C-cTnC (19Brown L.J. Sale K.L. Hills R. Rouviere C. Song L. Zhang X. Fajer P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12765-12770Google Scholar, 20Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 170AGoogle Scholar), and the proximity of the C- and N-cTnC domains is essentially unaltered by Ca2+addition (33Dong W.J. Robinson J.M. Xing J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 280-289Google Scholar). Assuming a relatively fixed position of N-TnC relative to the actin filament (34Narita A. Yasunaga T. Ishikawa T. Mayanagi K. Wakabayashi T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 241-261Google Scholar), the 19.7 Å increase in distance B can be attributed to the translation of cTnI-R into the N-cTnC hydrophobic pocket. Narita et al. (34Narita A. Yasunaga T. Ishikawa T. Mayanagi K. Wakabayashi T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 241-261Google Scholar) have proposed that Ca2+ activation induces a ∼50-Å TnC C-domain repositioning on the surface of actin, which would also reposition N-cTnI-I on the actin surface. In summary, we have shown a large Ca2+-induced extended conformation of the contiguous inhibitory and regulatory regions of cTnI in cTn. This conformational transition arises from an extension of the inhibitory region and an orientational change of the regulatory region away from the inhibitory region. The regulatory region does not experience a Ca2+-induced increase in its end-to-end distance. The present results strengthen our previous proposal that the inhibitory region in the cTnC-cTnI interface provides the main Ca2+-induced switching mechanism between relaxation and activation. The transition of the inhibitory region of cTnI from a helix-loop-helix motif to a more extended conformation enables TnI-I to span distance between the N- and C-cTnC domains. This switching event places TnI-R near the N-domain of cTnC where it can bind to the activation-exposed hydrophobic patch. We thank Dr. Takeda for discussing Tn Cα-Cα distances prior publication."

Cell. 2000; 6: 1377-1387Google Scholar) encoding a B-type cyclin required for normal S-phase (28Connolly T. Beach D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 768-776Google Scholar, 29Mondesert O. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1527-1533Google Scholar). Two other non-essential F-box proteins Pof10 and Pof3 have been reported. Although the function of Pof10 remains to be characterized (30Ikebe C. Kominami K. Toda T. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1399-1407Google Scholar), Pof3 is required for genome integrity and control of telomere length (31Katayama S. Kitamura K. Lehmann A. Nikaido O. Toda T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 211-224Google Scholar). In this study we have identified and characterized functions of the fission yeast Skp1 homologue. We have also identified a novel essential F-box protein Pof6 that associates with Skp1 in a non-SCF complex. Interestingly, both Skp1 and Pof6 appear to be essential for cell separation of fission yeast cells. S. pombe strains used: h + ade6–210 ura4D18 leu1–32,h − ade6–216 ura4D18 leu1–32,h + leu1–32 (Stratagene),h + cdc25–22 ade6–216 leu1–32 (lab stock), and h + nda3–311 leu1–32 his2 (Lab stock). Classical S. pombe techniques were performed as described (32Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Google Scholar). A small-scale library of S. pombe genomic DNA was constructed and probed. Southern blot analysis revealed that when genomic DNA is digested withEcoRI-HindIII, a probe corresponding to the partial skp1 cDNA hybridizes a band of about 1.7 kb. Genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI andHindIII, and the fragments ranging from 1.5 to 2 kb were cloned in pRS306. The resulting library was probed with the same probe. Positive clones were sequenced and shown to contain a 1.7-kb insert harboring the skp1 gene. A full-length cDNA ofskp1 was cloned by PCR on an S. pombecDNA library (a kind gift of M. Minet and F. Lacroute) with the following primers: 5′-AGC-GGC-CGC-GTC-GAC-GAA-TTC-ATG-TCC-AAA-ATC-AAA-C-3′ and 5′-TGC-GGC-CGC-GGA-TCC-CTC- GAG-CTA-TCT-GTC-TTC-GG-3′. 700 bp upstream (PCR1) and 400 bp downstream (PCR2) regions of the skp1 open reading frame were amplified using the following primers: 5′-CCG-GAA-TTC-TAG-TAA-CTC-CAC-TAA-CA and 5′-CCC-AAG-CTT-TGT-TGA-TGT-ATG-TAA-GTA-ATG-GAT-3′ for PCR1 and 5′-CCC-AAG-CTT-TTT-GTG-GCT-TTT-TGT-GTA-TA-3′ and 5′-CCG-CTC-GAG-TAA-GCA-ATT-CGG-GAT-AGT-AAG-3′ for PCR2. The EcoRI-HindIII-digested PCR1 fragment and the HindIII-XhoI-digested PCR2 fragments were cloned together in a pSK vector. A HindIII fragment containing the S. pombe ura4 gene was inserted between the PCR1 and PCR2 fragments to give the pSK-skp1Δ. A diploid strain was transformed with anEcoRI-XhoI fragment of the pSK-skp1Δ, and transformants were selected on plates lacking uracil and checked by Southern blot analysis. Deletion ofpof6 was performed as described by Bähleret al. (33Bähler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Google Scholar) using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GTA-GTC-GTC-ACT-ATT-TTA-TGA-AGT-ATG-CGG-AAT-ACC-TGT-GAT-CAT-AAT-ATC-ATG-TTC-GCT-AGA-ACC-AAA-TAG-ATT-TCA-TGA-CGG-ATC-CCC-GGG-TTA-ATT-AA-3′ and 5′-GCC-TAA- AGC-AGA-AAG-CAA-GAT-GCA-TTT-TTA-AAG-TGT-ATG-GTA-ATA- ACA-AAA-AAA-GGA-TAT-GAA-CAA-AAA-ATA-AAA-AAT-ATG-AAT- TCG-AGC-TCG-TTT-AAA-C-3′. A two-step PCR approach was used to generate the skp1–3f andskp1–4f alleles using the following primers: external oligos, 5′-CCG-GAA-TTC-TAG-TAA-CTC-CAC-TAA-CA-3′ and 5′-CCG-CTC-GAG-TAA-GCA-ATT-CGG-GAT-AGT-AAG-3′; mutated oligos for skp1–3f, 5′-TCG-GAA-AAC-ATT-CAA-CAA-CCC-TAA-TGA-3′ and 5′-TCA-TTA-GGG-TTG-TTG-AAT-GTT-TTC-CGA-3′; mutated oligos forskp1–4f, 5′-GGA-TAT-CAA-ACC-TTC-GCT-TGA-TAC-TGG-TT-3′ and 5′-AAC-CAG-TAT-CAA-GCG-AAG-GTT-TGA-TAT-CC-3′. TheEcoRI-XhoI-digested fragments of the final PCR products were cloned in pSK digested inEcoRI-XhoI and sequenced. Subsequently, thekanR cassette from pFA6a-kanMX (33Bähler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Google Scholar) was introduced downstream of the mutant alleles. TheEcoRI-HindIII linear fragments containing theskp1–3f and skp1–4f mutants, respectively, were used to transform the strain. Integration was confirmed by Southern blotting and sequencing. For Western blots, boiled extracts were prepared as described (32Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Google Scholar) and blots were probed with anti-Cdc2, anti-Y15, anti-tubulin, anti-Cdt1, or anti-GFP (all gifts of P. Nurse). The anti-Psh1 is a kind gift of D. Wolf (34Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsuge T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1382-1385Google Scholar). For the H1 kinase, native extracts were prepared, and 1 mg of proteins was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Cdc2 antibodies (a kind gift of P. Nurse) for 40 min, and protein-A-Sepharose was added for a further 20 min. After 4 washes in HB buffer, kinase buffer (1 mg/ml Calbiochem H1 histone, 200 μm[γ-32P]ATP 40 μCi/ml) was added for 25 min at 30 °C. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and the gel exposed to x-ray film for a few hours. GFP fusions were constructed under the control of the nmt1 promoter in diploids and visualized in living cells. Cells were cultured in minimal media supplemented or not with 5 μm thiamine. Cells were observed using a 100×/1.30 Zeiss oil immersion objective lens. Images were obtained on a cooled CCD camera with an exposure time of 2 s. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 5.0. Cells were grown in rich media overnight. They were harvested and resuspended in minimal media supplemented with NH4 and amino acids. When reaching late log phase, cells were filtered, washed, and resuspended in minimal media lacking NH4. They were grown in these conditions for 18 h. NH4 was then added back and temperature raised at the same time. Diploid cells were induced to sporulate in minimal media lacking NH4. When 99% of asci were formed, they were digested 16 h in glusulase at 25 °C and washed. Spores were inoculated in minimal medium, and samples were examined after 14 and 24 h, fixed and stained with DAPI. The pof6 open reading frame has been tagged with the TAP cassette using the PCR approach and vectors described by Tasto et al. (45Tasto J. Carnahan R.H. McDonald W.H. Gould K.L. Yeast. 2001; 18: 657-662Google Scholar). The TAP cassette (hereafter referred to as “TAP fusion” or “Pof6-TAP”) consists of a calmoduline-binding domain followed by a peptide corresponding to the consensus sequence of TEV protease and two repeats of the IgG-binding domain of protein A. This enables two purifications to be performed in a row, first taking advantage of the affinity of IgG for protein A beads and second, after elution from the beads with TEV, using calmodulin beads. This method has been widely used in yeast as described by Gavin et al. (35Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M. Remor M. Hofert C. Schelder M. Brajenovic M. Ruffner H. Merino A. Klein K. Hudak M. Dickson D. Rudi T. Gnau V. Bauch A. Bastuck S. Huhse B. Leutwein C. Heurtier M.A. Copley R.R. Edelmann A. Querfurth E. Rybin V. Drewes G. Raida M. Bouwmeester T. Bork P. Seraphin B. Kuster B. Neubauer G. Superti-Furga G. Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Google Scholar). The tagged protein can be detected with an IgG-peroxydase antibody (Sigma) due to the high affinity of IgG for protein A. Hereafter, we refer to this antibody as “anti-TAP.” During a two-hybrid screen with the Mcs2 cyclin (36Molz L. Beach D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1723-1732Google Scholar), one of the cDNA clones isolated was found to encode for a fission yeast protein with strong similarity to Skp1. Subsequently a 1.7-kb genomic fragment containing an apparent full-length open reading frame was isolated and predicted to encode a protein with 50% identity to budding yeast Skp1. As the name skp1 was already in use in fission yeast (37Plyte S.E. Feoktistova A. Burke J.D. Woodgett J.R. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1756Google Scholar), we have first entered the new gene into the fission yeast protein data base (PombeDB) and GenBankTM (accession number AF071066) as shp1 for Skp1 homologuepombe, although several other names have been used since, including psh1 (23Seibert V. Prohl C. Schoultz I. Rhee E. Lopez R. Abderazzaq K. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 22Google Scholar, 34Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsuge T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1382-1385Google Scholar) and skp1 (31Katayama S. Kitamura K. Lehmann A. Nikaido O. Toda T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 211-224Google Scholar). However, for simplicity we decided to use the name skp1 in this study. The lack of sequences with similarity to skp1 in the fission yeast genome suggests that as its budding yeast counterpart,skp1 is unique. Alignment of Skp1 with homologues from various species reveals high conservation throughout the length of the protein with the highest similarity in the C terminus (Fig.1 A), especially in the residues identified as being involved in binding F-box proteins in the published SCF structure (14Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Google Scholar, 38Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Google Scholar). skp1 is an essential gene as determined by the formation of two viable spores from sporulation of diploid S. pombe cells in which one copy of skp1 was deleted (Fig. 1 B). On plates, skp1-deleted spores germinate, and a fraction of these cells divide once (data not shown). The terminal phenotype ofskp1-deleted cells was further studied by a spore germination assay. To this end, spores from a diploid heterozygous for skp1 (skp1/skp1::ura4) were cultured in medium lacking uracil allowing only theskp1::ura4 spores to germinate. Analysis of these spores 24 h after germination (when cell number did not increase anymore) by DAPI staining revealed slightly elongated cells (Fig.1 C). Unexpectedly, a significant fraction (25%) of theskp1-deleted cells arrested with two nuclei and a septum (Fig. 1 C, arrows). The identification of both a G1/S and a mitotic function for the budding yeastSKP1 was based on two functionally distinct classes of ts mutants. skp1–11 (1Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Google Scholar) and skp1–3 (8Connelly C. Hieter P. Cell. 1996; 86: 275-285Google Scholar) arrests at the G1/S transition. By contrast, skp1–12 (1Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Google Scholar) and skp1–4 (8Connelly C. Hieter P. Cell. 1996; 86: 275-285Google Scholar) cells display either a severe defect (skp1–12) or total inability (skp1–4) to progress through mitosis and accumulate as large budded elongated cells with a G2 DNA content. skp1–3 and theskp1–4 alleles contain single amino acid changes in highly conserved residues (arrows in Fig. 1 A).skp1–4 contains a serine substitution at Leu-146 forming part of helix 6, and skp1–3 contains an asparagine substitution at Ile-172 directly contacting the F-box in the human Skp1-Skp2 structure (14Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Google Scholar). This prompted us to test whether mimicking these mutations in fission yeast skp1 would generate ts alleles. The resulting alleles were named skp1–3f(I139N) and skp1–4f (L113S; Fig. 1 A). When analyzed for temperature sensitivity skp1–4f cells did not differ from wild type cells (Fig. 1 D). By contrast, theskp1–3f allele was unable to grow at 37 °C (Fig.1 D) and was chosen for further analysis. At the permissive temperature (25 °C), exponentially growing skp1–3f cells were indistinguishable from wild type cells, but after 4 h at the restrictive temperature (37 °C), skp1–3f cells arrested cell cycle progression with a 2C DNA content as shown by FACS (Fig. 1 E). Cytological analysis revealed that a fraction of the arrested cells are elongated, resulting in a slight drift of the FACS 2C peak. Beside this phenotype, cells with multiple or very thick septum were also observed (Fig. 1 E,calcofluor). The 2C content of skp1–3f-arrested cells was unexpected considering the G1 arrest observed with the identical budding yeast mutant (8Connelly C. Hieter P. Cell. 1996; 86: 275-285Google Scholar). To analyze G1/S progression in more detail, cells were synchronized in G1by nitrogen starvation. Simultaneously, with release from the G1 block cells were transferred to 37 °C, and progression through S-phase was monitored by FACS analysis demonstrating comparable progression of control and skp1–3fcells through S-phase (Fig. 1 F). To further characterize the arrest point in skp1–3f, a time course experiment monitoring Cdc2 activity and Tyr-15 phosphorylation was performed. Initiation of mitosis is triggered by activation of Cdc2 due to dephosphorylation of Tyr-15 by the Cdc25 phosphatase (39Moreno S. Nurse P. Russell P. Nature. 1990; 344: 549-552Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis of boiled extracts of skp1–3fcells indicated a marked decrease in Tyr(P)-15 following a shift to the restrictive temperature (Fig. 1 G,phospho-Tyr-15), whereas Cdc2 levels remained constant. This was correlated with a strong increase in Cdc2 activity (Cdc2 H1 kinase). These characteristics of the arrested skp1–3fcells were in marked contrast to G2-arrestedcdc25–22 cells, where phosphorylation of Cdc2 Tyr-15 is increased and Cdc2 activity is decreased as expected (Fig.1 G, cdc25–22; at 6 h the mutant leaks through the block). The appearance of aberrant septa in both theskp1-deleted cells as well as in skp1–3f cells at the restrictive temperature was intriguing and suggested a role for Skp1 in septum processing and cell separation. However, demonstration of this was complicated by the fact that the majority of cells arrest earlier in mitosis, which precedes cytokinesis by 10–15 min. To our knowledge, the only efficient way to block fission yeast cells in mitosis is to use the nda3–311 allele encoding a cold-sensitive allele of beta-tubulin (40Hiraoka Y. Toda T. Yanagida M. Cell. 1984; 39: 349-358Google Scholar). Therefore a strain was generated combining nda3–311 (restrictive temperature 20 °C) and skp1–3f (restrictive temperature 37 °C). This would potentially allow a successive restriction of firstnda3–311 and then skp1–3f functions leading to an increase in the number of cells with the septum defect. To this end, control nda3–311 cells and double mutant skp1–3f nda3–311 cells were synchronized for 6 h at 20 °C followed by a rapid shift (in a PCR machine) to 36 °C after which fraction of cells with septa was monitored (Fig.2 A). The septation index in the nda3–311 control cells peaked at 75% at 10 min and had decreased to 47% at 20 min. In the double-mutant skp1–3f nda3–311 cells, the septation index rose similarly to the controls, but no decrease was noted at 20 or 30 min (Fig.2 A), consistent with impaired septum processing. A second approach to increasing the number of cells displaying aberrant septa involved a “block-release-block” experiment. This was initiated by incubating skp1–3f and control cultures at 36 °C for 4 h in the presence of 15 mm hydroxyurea (HU). This led to an early S arrest in control cells (Fig.2 B, 240 min, control) with a 1C DNA content, whereas the skp1–3f cells displayed a predominantly 2C DNA content (Fig. 2 B, 240 min, skp1–3f), suggesting they were blocked after S-phase, which is consistent with our previous results (Fig. 1). Subsequently, control cells (blocked at G1/S) andskp1–3f cells (mostly blocked in mitosis) were shifted to 25 °C (the permissive temperature for skp1–3f) with simultaneous removal of HU and incubated in fresh medium at 25 °C for 20 min. Cells were then re-shifted to 36 °C and followed by FACS analysis. In the skp1–3f cells a 4C DNA peak appeared at 30 min and increased until the last time point (Fig. 2 B), whereas the 1C wild type culture completed S-phase and subsequently continued a normal cycle. Cytological analysis of the 4C skp1–3f cells revealed accumulation of pronounced thick septa (Fig. 2 C). Based on this, it is likely that the 4C DNA content of these cells is due to a 2C content in both daughter nuclei still attached by the thick septum, indicating that both nuclei have undergone replication. The possibility that the peak would be due to re-replication of unseptated cells was ruled out by unchanged levels of Cdc18 levels throughout the experiment (data not shown). The completion of DNA synthesis in the two daughter nuclei in the septated cells is consistent with the results above (Fig.1), demonstrating that Skp1 is not required for replication. The results described above indicate that skp1–3f arrest with a pleiotropic phenotype with elongated cells and with the majority of cells arresting in mitosis with high Cdc2 activity, but with other cells arresting just prior to cell separation with a septum defect. These pleiotropic phenotypes are likely to reflect the various functions Skp1 mediates in distinct SCF complexes with various F-box proteins. For example, elongation of skp1–3f cells at 37 °C is likely to reflect inactivation of SCFPof3 aspof3 deletion has a similar phenotype (31Katayama S. Kitamura K. Lehmann A. Nikaido O. Toda T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 211-224Google Scholar). A number of F-box proteins can be identified by similarity searches from the fission yeast genome. We have also performed two-hybrid screening with Skp1, leading to the isolation of several F-box proteins partly overlapping with those identified through similarity searches. 2L. Tafforeau, S. Bamps, J. Vandenhaute, and D. Hermand, manuscript in preparation. One of the F-box proteins identified in this screen was Pof6. As described above, Pof6 was identified through a two-hybrid interaction with Skp1 (Fig.3 A). The predicted Pof6 protein encodes a 872-amino acid protein with the F-box region between amino acids 33 and 75 (Fig. 3 B). Pof6 also has a CAAX-motif at its C terminus, suggesting that Pof6 may be modified through prenylation (41Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Google Scholar). Pof6 does not have any closely related sequences in fission yeast, and it is most closely related to Yarrowia lipolytica Sls2p (28% identity between amino acids 45 and 872 in Pof6 (42Boisrame A. Beckerich J.M. Gaillardin C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 601-609Google Scholar)) and budding yeast Rcy1p proteins (24% identity between amino acids 150 and 872 in Pof6 (10Wiederkehr A. Avaro S. Prescianotto-Baschong C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 397-410Google Scholar)). Sls2p has been implicated in secretion and Rcy1p is involved in recycling. In addition, significant sequence similarity was detected between Pof6 and the exocyst subunit Sec10 involved in exocytosis (43TerBush D.R. Maurice T. Roth D. Novick P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6483-6494Google Scholar). Using reiterations on PSI-BLAST this similarity was noted between amino acids 147 and 853 of Pof6 (13% identity, 30% similarity with fission yeast Sec10). As septum processing and cell separation require exocyst function (44Wang H. Tang X. Liu J. Trautmann S. Balasundaram D. McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 515-529Google Scholar), Pof6 was chosen for further studies as a candidate F-box protein mediating the septum processing phenotype noted inskp1 mutants. Pof6 protein was found to be constantly expressed during the cell cycle (Fig. 3 C). pof6 is an essential gene as determined by the formation of two viable spores from sporulation of diploid S. pombe cells in which one copy of pof6was deleted (Fig. 3 D). Germinated spores form highly branched structures corresponding to unseparated cells (Fig.3 E), and in some cases, a thick septum between two cells was observed (Fig. 3 F). This phenotype is highly reminiscent of what we observed in skp1–3f except that no branching was noted with skp1–3f, which is likely due to the fact that cells lacking Skp1 cannot proceed through several cell cycles because Skp1 is also required for other essential steps (see Fig.1). To test if the Pof6 F-box protein is part of an SCF, a TAP fusion protein was expressed from the endogenous pof6 locus. After tandem affinity purification (45Tasto J. Carnahan R.H. McDonald W.H. Gould K.L. Yeast. 2001; 18: 657-662Google Scholar), the eluate was separated on lithium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE and silver-stained revealing several bands (Fig. 4 A). The 19-kDa band represents Skp1 as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 A). The identity of several other bands is unknown and will be subjected to further study. However, interestingly, no bands were detected at the expected size of Pcu1-myc (112 kDa, the only essential cullin in S. pombe (21Kominami K. Ochotorena I. Toda T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 721-735Google Scholar)) or Pip1 (13 kDa, the Rbx1 homologue). Furthermore, the absence of Pcu1 from the Pof6 complex could also be demonstrated by Western blot analysis, showing that although the characteristic doublet representing Pcu1-myc (46Osaka F. Saeki M. Katayama S. Aida N. Toh E.A. Kominami K. Toda T. Suzuki T. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Kato S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3475-3484Google Scholar) was clearly detected in the extract used for the purification, it did not co-purify with Pof6. Separate co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed this result (data not shown). To localize Pof6 in the cell, three GFP-Pof6 constructs corresponding to wild type, a mutant lacking the F-box, or a mutant lacking the CAAX box have been integrated in diploid cells at the pof6 locus under the control of the thiamine-regulated nmt1 promoter. Fig.4 B shows anti-GFP Western blots performed on extracts from these strains grown in the presence or absence of thiamine. The diploid strains were subsequently sporulated, and tetrads were analyzed indicating that only the disruption of the F-box of Pof6 was detrimental to fission yeast survival based on the 2:2 segregation (Fig. 4 C). Germinated spores on the plate have a phenotype identical to the pof6 deletion (not shown). To analyze the subcellular localization of GFP-Pof6, GFP-Pof6-ΔF-box, or GFP-Pof6-ΔCAAX, the strains were grown in the presence of thiamine (low expression, see Fig. 4 B). The wild type GFP-Pof6 displays a nuclear enrichment but is excluded from a nuclear structure that could correspond to the nucleolus. GFP-Pof6 is also localized at cell tips and on both sides of the septum in septated cells (Fig.4 D, wt). Localization of the GFP-Pof6-ΔF-box and GFP-Pof6-ΔCAAX were similar to wild type (Fig. 4 D, Δ-F-box, ΔCAAX) except that in the CAAX box mutant, localization at the tips was less pronounced. This indicates that the F-box, and by extension association with Skp1, is not required for proper localization of Pof6, though it is essential for Pof6 function. It also shows that the CAAX box is not required for the essential function of Pof6. The localization of Pof6 to the septum is consistent with a function in septum processing and cell separation. It is interesting to note that this subcellular localization is similar to that noted for the Sec8p exocyst component (44Wang H. Tang X. Liu J. Trautmann S. Balasundaram D. McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 515-529Google Scholar). From these studies we conclude that Pof6 and Skp1 are physically associated in a non-SCF complex. Both Skp1 and Pof6 are required for normal septum processing and cell separation, a phenomenon that has not been characterized in much detail. However, recently the Sec8 subunit of the exocyst complex was also found to be required for septum processing and cell separation (44Wang H. Tang X. Liu J. Trautmann S. Balasundaram D. McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 515-529Google Scholar), and several other exocyst proteins in addition to Sec8p were found at the septa. Thus it is interesting to speculate that Pof6 and Skp1 functions in cell separation would be related to exocyst function. In this regard it is very interesting to note that the apparent homologues of Pof6 in Y. lipolytica (Sls2p) and budding yeast (Rcy1p) have been implicated in transport and recycling, respectively (10Wiederkehr A.

https://openalex.org/W2046751730,"The reaction mechanism of the Na,K-ATPase is thought to involve a number of ligand-induced conformational changes. The specific amino acid residues responsible for binding many of the important ligands have been identified; however, details of the specific conformational changes produced by ligand binding are largely undescribed. The experiments described in this paper begin to identify interactions between domains of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit that depend on the presence of particular ligands. The major cytoplasmic loop (between TM4 and TM5), which we have previously shown contains the ATP-binding domain, was overexpressed in bacteria either with a His6 tag or as a fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase. We have observed that these polypeptides associate in the presence of MgATP. Incubation with [γ-32P]ATP under conditions that result in phosphorylation of the full-length Na,K-ATPase did not result in32P incorporation into either the His6 tag or glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. The MgATP-induced association was strongly inhibited by prior modification of the fusion proteins with fluorescein isothiocyanate or by simultaneous incubation with 10 μm eosin, indicating that the effect of MgATP is due to interactions within the nucleotide-binding domain. These data are consistent with Na,K-ATPase associating within cells via interactions in the nucleotide-binding domains. Although any functional significance of these associations for ion transport remains unresolved, they may play a role in cell function and in modulating interactions between the Na,K-ATPase and other proteins.

Although any functional significance of these associations for ion transport remains unresolved, they may play a role in cell function and in modulating interactions between the Na,K-ATPase and other proteins. The Na,K-ATPase is an integral membrane protein that plays a central role in ionic homeostasis in animals by mediating the translocation of Na+ and K+ ions against their electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane (for a review, see Ref. 1Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase functions as a heterodimer composed of a 105-kDa α-subunit that spans the plasma membrane 10 times (2Hu Y.-K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Google Scholar) and a ∼55-kDa glycosylated β-subunit that has a short cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular domain. At present, whether the β-subunit plays a part in the transport process remains unclear, but evidence is accumulating that indicates the importance of β in targeting the enzyme complex to the plasma membrane (3Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C982-C992Google Scholar, 4Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase belongs to a large family of enzymes known as the P2-type ATPases (5Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Google Scholar). Members of this important protein class couple the hydrolysis of ATP to the transmembrane translocation of cations and have been identified in every taxonomic phylum. Recently, the three-dimensional structures of several P2-type ATPases including the H-ATPase (6Kühlbrandt W. Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 510-516Google Scholar), the Na,K-ATPase (7Rice W.J. Young H.S. Martin D.W. Sachs J.R. Stokes D.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2187-2197Google Scholar), and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (8Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar, 9Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Google Scholar) at 8-, 11-, and 2.6-Å resolution, respectively, have been solved. As one might predict, the high resolution sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) 1The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase; ABD, ATP-binding domain; FITC, fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; SOD, superoxide dismutase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid pump structure shows that the 10-transmembrane segments are largely α-helical (8Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar). Indeed, the SERCA crystal structure confirmed several previously proposed structural suggestions based on functional studies, including the suggestion that the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains were surrounded by the other helices as opposed to directly contacting the membrane lipid (10Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Google Scholar, 11Gatto C. Lutsenko S. Shin J.-M. Sachs G. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13737-13740Google Scholar). In addition, the structure of the cytoplasmic loops results in the formation of three distinct domains: 1) the N domain, containing the nucleotide-binding site; 2) the P domain, containing the phosphorylation site; and 3) the A domain, referred to as the “activator” domain by Toyoshima et al. (8Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar, 9Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Google Scholar), consisting of the N terminus and the M2M3 loop. The Na,K-ATPase and the gastric H,K-ATPase are the only members of the P2-type ATPase family that possess two obligatory subunits, α and β. Consequently, these enzymes have a quaternary structure; whether this structure is simply an αβ protomer or contains higher oligomers remains a central issue of scientific investigation (see Ref. 1Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Google Scholar). Identification of the subunit domains involved in assembly and trafficking of Na,K-ATPase has been approached by immune precipitation experiments with truncated β-subunits (12Jaunin P. Horisberger J.-D. Richter K. Good P.J. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 577-585Google Scholar,13Laughery M. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar) and chimeras between the Na,K-ATPase and gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunits (14Blostein R. Zhang R. Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10654-10658Google Scholar, 15Mense M. Rajendran V. Blostein R. Caplan M.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9803-9812Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of the Na,K-ATPase remains a controversial issue. Indeed, it seems hard to dispute the findings that monomeric (i.e. detergent-solubilized) αβ protomers of the sodium pump are sufficient to perform Na,K-ATPase activity (16Brotherus J.R. Jacobsen L. Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 731: 290-303Google Scholar, 17Jorgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2889-2897Google Scholar). However, it has been convincingly demonstrated that sodium pump protomer-protomer interactions do indeed take place and that adjacent pumps can be tethered together via chemical cross-linking (18Ganjeizadeh M. Zolotarjova N. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15707-15710Google Scholar). This apparent paradox has been explained by suggesting that close packing of sodium pumps within high density preparations leads to incidental contact, which can be captured via cross-linking (19Martin D.W. Sachs J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 3195-3200Google Scholar). Although some functional measurements appear more easily resolved by a functional diprotomer (20Yokoyama T. Kaya S. Abe K. Taniguchi K. Katoh T. Yazawa M. Hayashi Y. Mardh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31792-31796Google Scholar, 21Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14277-14284Google Scholar, 22Linnertz H. Urbanova P. Obsil T. Herman P. Amler E. Schoner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28813-28821Google Scholar), more complex models for a single functioning protomer can accommodate many of these findings (23Martin D.W. Sachs J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24512-24517Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is clear that sodium pump molecules are in close proximity to each other within some cell membrane preparations. Although this association may not be necessary for sodium pump action, it may play a role in cell function by bringing other proteins that interact with the sodium pump into close proximity. For example, the Na,K-ATPase has been shown to be a membrane anchor for phosphoinositide-3 kinase in opossum kidney cells (24Yodowski G.A. Efendiev R. Pedemonte C.H. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 6556-6561Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that the isolated nucleotide binding domain can directly associate with full-length Na,K-ATPase purified from dog kidney. In addition, this interaction was significantly enhanced by the binding of magnesium and ATP. To further investigate the sites of interaction, we determined whether the isolated ATP-binding domain (ABD) could interact with itself in the absence of other pump domains. In the presence of MgATP, we found that a GST-tagged ABD associated with a His6-tagged ABD. Consistent with the facilitation of interaction by nucleotide binding was the observation that both FITC and eosin significantly decreased the degree of association. Taken together, these data imply that the Na,K-ATPase is capable of self-association and that this quaternary structure is stabilized upon MgATP binding. Preliminary accounts of this work have been previously reported (25Costa C.J. Gatto C. Kaplan J.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80 (abstr.): 36Google Scholar). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B and Rainbow protein molecular weight markers were from Amersham Biosciences. NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4, glutathione, Tris-base, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, antipain, leupeptin, pepstatin A, FITC, eosin, and imidazole were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant streptavidin-tagged superoxide dismutase was a generous gift of John Eisses (Oregon Health and Science University). The bacterial lysis reagent, BPER II, was purchased from Pierce. The primary antibody, mouse anti-penta-His, was obtained from Qiagen, and the secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse, was from Sigma. Escherichia coli was used to overexpress the M4M5 cytoplasmic loop from α-subunit of the rat Na,K-ATPase. The M4M5 loop includes the amino acid residues between Lys354 and Lys774 of the α1-subunit from rat. Two fusion protein versions of this peptide were constructed for this study: 1) a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged M4M5 loop and 2) a His6-tagged M4M5 loop. The GST construct was produced via PCR amplification of a 1260-bp section encoding the M4M5 loop from a pGEM-rat α1cDNA construct (generous gift from Dr. Robert Mercer, Washington University, St. Louis, MO). An EcoRI restriction endonuclease site was engineered into both primers, allowing a single digestion and ligation step into the multiple cloning site of pGEX-1λT vector (Amersham Biosciences). Positively transformed DH5α cells were selected for ampicillin resistance conferred by pGEX-1λT, and correctly oriented clones were determined via restriction endonuclease mapping and subsequent DNA sequencing. A single colony was grown overnight and used to inoculate 500 ml of LBamp (100 μg/ml) containing 2% ethanol. (We previously observed that the presence of ethanol dramatically increased the amount of fusion protein appearing in the soluble fraction after bacterial cell lysis (26Gatto C. Wang A.X. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10578-10585Google Scholar).) After an A 600 of 0.8 was attained, protein synthesis was induced with 0.1 mg/ml isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and the cells were grown for an additional 12 h at room temperature. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation (7500 × g for 25 min), resuspended in 10 ml of BPER II (Pierce), and lysed via gentle Dounce homogenization. Lysis was performed in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture containing 80 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A. After lysis, soluble proteins were separated from cellular debris by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 45 min). The GST fusion protein was purified from the supernatant via a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) affinity column, and then the bound protein was washed with ∼50 column volumes of buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3) to remove nonspecifically boundE. coli proteins. The protein was used in subsequent procedures either bound to the support or eluted off the affinity column with 10 mm reduced glutathione. The eluent was dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) to remove the glutathione and phosphate for interaction experiments. When support-bound GST-protein was used, the column was washed with two volumes of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) to remove the phosphate. The size of the GST-M4M5 construct is ∼63 kDa, estimated by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Google Scholar). The yield was typically 5–8 mg of GST-M4M5 loop/liter of cell culture. The His6-tagged M4M5 loop was produced and purified as described previously (26Gatto C. Wang A.X. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10578-10585Google Scholar). Briefly, the identical region of the rat α1-subunit (i.e.Lys354–Lys774) used for the GST construct was cloned into the six-histidine fusion protein expression vector, pET-28b (Novagen), between the EcoRI and NdeI sites. TheE. coli transformants were selected by the kanamycin resistance (30 μg/ml) conferred by pET-28. A single colony was grown overnight, and this culture was used to inoculate 500 ml of LBkan (2% ethanol). After reaching anA 600 of 0.8, protein expression was induced by the addition of a final concentration of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and the cells were grown at room temperature for an additional 12 h. Bacteria were collected and lysed, and soluble proteins were separated from cellular debris via centrifugation, as described above for the GST-M4M5 loop. The His6-tagged ATP-binding domain was purified by passing the lysate over a Ni2+ affinity column, His-Bind resin (nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, Novagen). The column was washed with ∼50 column volumes of binding buffer containing 5 mmimidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). The His6-tagged protein was eluted from the resin with elution buffer containing 400 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). The eluent was dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) to remove the imidazole for interaction experiments. The size of the His6 construct is ∼46 kDa, estimated by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Google Scholar). Dog kidney Na,K-ATPase was purified by the method of Jorgensen (29Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 36-52Google Scholar) with the modifications described previously (30Gatto C. Thornewell S.J. Holden J.P. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24995-25003Google Scholar). In order to assay for binding between the immobilized GST-ABD and dog kidney ATPase, 50 μg of dog kidney enzyme in 200 μl of 50 mmTris (pH 7.4) and 0.1% C12E8 was combined with a 200-μl slurry of GST-ABD conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose in the presence or absence of enzyme substrates (as shown in the figure legends). Control assays were performed using slurries of glutathione-Sepharose 4B that was not bound to GST-ABD. Microcentrifuge tubes containing the 400-μl reaction slurries were rotated at room temperature for 60 min, and the unbound enzyme was removed by centrifugation (1000 rpm in a tabletop microcentrifuge for 5 min). The supernatant was discarded, and the Sepharose pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4, with corresponding substrate where appropriate) and rotated at room temperature for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and the Sepharose was washed two additional times in the same manner. Proteins were removed from the Sepharose by the addition of 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (i.e. 1:1:1 (v/v/v) of 8 murea, 10% SDS, and 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol), and a 50-μl aliquot was resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel according to the method of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes by electroblotting in 10 mm CAPS, 10% MeOH, pH 11.0, for 2 h at 180-mA constant current (31Matsudaria P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Google Scholar). The PVDF membrane was blocked with 10% dry milk protein solution in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. The membrane was then incubated with an antibody against the Na,K-ATPase α- or β-subunit for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibody was removed, and the membrane was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 1 h with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-IgG at room temperature. The membrane was then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20, and the proteins were visualized by chemiluminescent detection of peroxidase activity using the SuperSignal substrate kit (Pierce). The GST-ABD fusion protein was bound to the glutathione-Sepharose and subsequently washed with TBS (50 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to remove unbound fusion protein. Domain-domain interactions were initiated by adding 50 μg of the His6-ABD to a slurry of the conjugated GST-ABD in a final volume of 200–400 μl of TBS alone or containing various ligands (see figure legends for details). The fusion proteins were rotated at 4 °C for 1–3 h. After the interaction period, the glutathione-Sepharose was pelleted via centrifugation (1000 rpm in a tabletop microcentrifuge for 5 min) and washed three times with a 20-volume quantity of 50 mm TBS, containing any additives that were present during the interaction period. Finally, the GST loop and any His6 loop bound to it were eluted from the Sepharose with 100 μl of 10 mm reduced glutathione or 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated via SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to PVDF as described above. Evidence for His6-ABD interaction with GST-ABD was demonstrated via immunostaining with mouse anti-penta-His antibody (Qiagen) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma). Eosin, tetrabromofluorescein, has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the Na,K-ATPase by competing with ATP (32Skou J.C. Esmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 232-240Google Scholar). Thus, we performed the domain-domain interaction experiments described above in the presence and absence of 10 μm eosin. FITC is a potent irreversible inhibitor of the Na,K-ATPase and has been shown to specifically label Lys501, which resides in the nucleotide binding site (33Farley R.A. Tran M.C. Carilli C.T. Hawke D. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9532-9535Google Scholar,34Kirley T.L. Wallick E.T. Lane L.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 767-773Google Scholar). The GST loop was modified by incubating the protein, bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B, with 20 μm FITC in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 9.0, 30 min, 25 °C). The unbound FITC was removed by washing the Sepharose twice with a 10-volume quantity of TBS. FITC labeling was confirmed by UV illumination of the labeled protein on a gel (see Fig. 7 B, middle panel). The His6 loop was labeled similarly, except the protein was not bound to the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid; thus, excess FITC was removed via dialysis (12-kDa cut-off) overnight against a 1000-volume quantity of 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0). In order to determine whether FITC modification was necessary at either or both ABD partners, both FITC-labeled and unlabeled GST-ABD were incubated in the presence of 5 mm MgATP and 50 μg of either FITC-labeled or unlabeled His6-ABD. Na,K-ATPase activity was determined in a standard assay medium containing 1 mm EGTA, 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 3 mm Na2ATP, 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, and 0.5 μg of purified dog kidney enzyme (or enzyme solubilized with C12E8). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and the amount of inorganic phosphate released through ouabain-sensitive ATP hydrolysis was measured as described previously (35Gatto C. Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 90-100Google Scholar). The phosphorylation measurements were carried out essentially as described previously (36Pedemonte C.H. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7966-7973Google Scholar) in 50 μl of medium containing 100 mm NaCl (or 100 mm KCl), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 50 μg of protein. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP ([γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 7.3 μm Tris-ATP) and incubated in an ice bath for 60 s. The phosphorylation was stopped with 750 μl of “ice-cold” 5% (v/v) perchloric acid containing 0.5 mm Tris-ATP and 1.5 mm Tris-phosphate. The samples were filtered through Millipore filters (pore size 0.45 μm), washed three times with 3 ml of stopping buffer, and counted in a scintillation counter. Specific phosphorylation was calculated from the difference between 32P incorporation in native protein preparations and those where perchloric acid was added before ATP to denature the proteins. For these studies, a GST fusion protein of the large cytoplasmic loop between the fourth and fifth transmembrane segments was constructed. We reported previously that this GST-M4M5 loop was able to bind ATP as determined via protection against FITC labeling (37Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. Gatto C. Daoud S. Kenney L.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 45-55Google Scholar). More recently, the corresponding domain in the full-length rabbit fast twitch SERCA has been shown to coordinate TNP-AMP binding by x-ray crystallographic analysis (8Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar). To determine whether the GST-M4M5 loop (GST-ABD) associated with purified full-length Na,K-ATPase, C12E8-solubilized dog kidney Na,K-ATPase (50 μg) was incubated at 25 °C with a slurry of the GST loop bound to a glutathione-Sepharose affinity resin. The incubation was performed both in the absence and presence of pump substrates (Fig.1 A). There was a clear interaction between the GST-ABD and the intact Na,K-ATPase in the presence of MgATP (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). Occasionally, we observed that there was a less prominent band in the presence of MgADP as well (Fig. 1 A, lane 5), suggesting that MgADP may also promote an interacting conformation. Specifically, we observed a MgADP-facilitated interaction in three of five experiments where the PVDF membrane was probed with an anti-α antibody and in one experiment where membrane was probed with anti-β (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, we never observed GST-ABD/Na,K-ATPase interactions in the absence of substrates or in the presence of sodium, potassium, or magnesium, alone. Additionally, when experiments were performed with dog kidney enzyme that had not been treated with C12E8 (see “Experimental Procedures”), no interactions were observed in the presence or absence of any substrates (data not shown). The observed interactions were not due to C12E8 denaturation of the enzyme, since the detergent-solubilized enzyme has been shown to retain function (16Brotherus J.R. Jacobsen L. Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 731: 290-303Google Scholar, 38Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5332-5336Google Scholar), and we confirmed these findings for our experimental conditions (Fig. 1 C). We next determined the concentration of MgATP required to stabilize the interaction between the GST-ABD and C12E8-solubilized sodium pump. These experiments are possible because the affinity for MgATP binding to the full-length Na,K-ATPase is more than 3 orders of magnitude greater than to the bacterially produced constructs (see “Discussion”) (26Gatto C. Wang A.X. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10578-10585Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that near millimolar MgATP concentrations are necessary to stabilize the heterodimer between GST-ABD and the full-length pump. The Na,K-ATPase nucleotide-binding domain comprises nearly 40% of the mass of the catalytic α-subunit. Furthermore, it has been shown that this domain undergoes dramatic conformational changes in response to substrate binding (39Karlish S.J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 111-136Google Scholar, 40Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4555-4564Google Scholar). Consequently, we decided to test whether the interactions observed between the intact Na,K-ATPase and the GST-ABD were mediated via contacts within the ATP-binding domain. These experiments were performed using either the GST-ABD or a His6-tagged fusion protein with the same polypeptide as the GST-ABD. The nucleotide-binding properties of the His6-ABD were described previously (26Gatto C. Wang A.X. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10578-10585Google Scholar); in addition, we found that the His6-ABD, like the GST-ABD, associates with the intact Na,K-ATPase in a MgATP-dependent manner (Fig.3). Therefore, the observed interactions between native Na,K-ATPase and the fusion proteins were mediated by enzyme contacts with the ATP-binding domain and not by either of the fusion protein affinity tags. However, the segment (or segments) of the full-length Na,K-ATPase that interacted with the bacterially produced ATP-binding domains remained to be determined. Thus, we initially designed experiments to determine whether the interactions occurred between the two ATP-binding domains (i.e. the M4M5 loop of the intact enzyme with the equivalent heterologously expressed isolated domain). We tested this hypothesis by measuring interactions between the two purified cytoplasmic loops themselves. The soluble His6-ABD was incubated with GST-ABD bound to glutathione-Sepharose resin in the presence of varying substrates. We observed that the two constructs did associate and that this association depended upon the simultaneous presence of both magnesium and ATP (Fig. 4 A). In other words, neither ATP alone nor magnesium alone was an effective promoter of the interaction. MgADP and MgAMP were unable to facilitate interaction between the two nucleotide-binding domains (Fig.4 B). The inability of MgADP to promote interactions between the GST-ABD and the His6-ABD, was somewhat surprising, considering that it did facilitate interactions between the GST-ABD and intact Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 1 A). Thus, this finding may suggest that MgADP binding to the full-length α-subunit elicits a conformation slightly different than when it is bound to the isolated M4M5 loop alone. Indeed, the nucleotide-bound crystal structure of SERCA indicates that both the N terminus and the M2M3 cytoplasmic loop (i.e. the “A” domain) are in close proximity to the M4M5 loop (8Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar, 9Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Google Scholar); the A domain is obviously absent from our bacterial constructs. It was important to ensure that MgATP does not facilitate nonspecific protein interactions with GST-ABD or glutathione-Sepharose. Therefore, we incubated a bacterially produced superoxide dismutase (SOD) fusion protein with the GST-ABD under the same conditions that promote interaction with the His6-ABD. Fig.5 shows that there was no interaction between the GST-ABD and SOD in the presence or absence of MgATP. The Western blot was probed with an anti-SOD antibody, and a positive control lane shows that the immunostaining was successful (Fig. 5) and that SOD would have been detectable had it interacted with the GST-ABD. To more directly examine the MgATP-dependent association between these ATP-binding domains, we determined whether known inhibitors of ATP binding to the Na,K-ATPase could block the interaction. For example, eosin is a reversible inhibitor of the Na,K-ATPase, and the binding of eosin and ATP are mutually exclusive (32Skou J.C. Esmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 232-240Google Scholar). Thus, eosin should block GST-ABD and His6-ABD interactions, by preventing MgATP binding. Consistent with t"

https://openalex.org/W2005339836,"MKP-M is a dual specificity phosphatase that preferentially inactivates JNK. mkp-M gene expression is rapidly induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in macrophages and is involved in the negative regulation of LPS-mediated JNK activation and tumor necrosis factor-α secretion. To reveal the transcriptional regulation of the mkp-M gene, we isolated the mouse mkp-M gene and mapped its transcriptional start site. Luciferase reporter plasmids containing 5′-upstream regions of the mkp-M gene were stably transfected into RAW264.7 cells. The assays using these cells revealed that the promoter region between −252 and −135 is required formkp-M promoter activation. Sequencing analysis revealed E box and CREB-responsive elements in this region, and electromobility shift assays and mutagenesis confirmed that both of these elements are essential for LPS responsiveness of the mkp-M gene. We also utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and found that LPS stimulation caused acetylation of histone H3 and H4 atmkp-M promoter in RAW264.7 cells. Consistent with this, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, increased endogenousmkp-M gene transcription. Finally, DNase I hypersensitivity site mapping revealed the inducible hypersensitivity site after LPS stimulation around the location of the E box and CREB-responsive elements. Altogether, our data indicated that the activation ofmkp-M gene transcription in macrophages by LPS is associated with histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling.

Altogether, our data indicated that the activation ofmkp-M gene transcription in macrophages by LPS is associated with histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling. The dual specificity protein phosphatases (DSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSP, dual-specificity protein phosphatase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; TSA, trichostatin A; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CRE, CREB-responsive element; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; MOPS, morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; IL, interleukin; HS, hypersensitivity are an emerging subclass of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase gene superfamily which have been shown to inactivate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) through dephosphorylation of both threonine and tyrosine residues within a signature sequence of TXY that are essential for the enzymatic activity (1Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Google Scholar). The members of DSPs share two common features as follows: a catalytic domain with significant amino acid sequence homology to a vaccinia virus dual specificity phosphatase, VH-1; and an N-terminal region homologous to the catalytic domain of the cdc25 phosphatase (rhodanese homology domain). Among its family members, some show highly selective substrate specificity, whereas others efficiently inactivate all three classes of MAPKs: extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase, and p38/RK/CSBP (p38). Three distinct classes of MAPKs play important roles in various cellular events. Because the activation of MAPKs is a reversible process and gene expression of many DSPs is significantly induced following stimulation with growth factors, cytokines, or cell stresses, the induction of MKPs is likely to provide the important mechanism for control of MAPK activity. To date, 10 members of the mammalian DSPs gene family have been isolated and characterized. These members of DSPs have been defined recently into three subgroups by their basic structural prediction from genomic sequence (2Theodosiou A. Ashworth A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 3009.1-3009.10Google Scholar): subgroup I, DUSPI (hVHI/CL100/MKP-1/3CH134), DUSP2 (hPAC-1), DUSP4 (hVH2/TYP1), and DUSP5 (hVH3/B23/MKP-2); subgroup II, DUSP6 (PYSTI/MK-3/rVH6), DUSP7 (PYST2/B59/MKP-X), DUSP9 (MKP-4), and DUSP10 (MKP-5); and subgroup III, DUSP 8 (hVH5/M3/6) and DUSP16 (MKP-7/ MKP-M). MKP-M, a dual specificity isolated from macrophage, also referred to as MKP-7 (3Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Google Scholar, 4Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Maeda R. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26629-26639Google Scholar) is a member of DSPs family which is homologous to the human protein MKP-7 (2Theodosiou A. Ashworth A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 3009.1-3009.10Google Scholar). MKP-M preferentially inactivates JNK (3Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Google Scholar, 5Matsuguchi T. Musikacharoen T. Johnson T.R. Kraft A.S. Yoshikai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6999-7009Google Scholar) when it is overexpressed in COS7 cells, and it also efficiently inactivates p38α and p38β in NIH3T3 cells (4Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Maeda R. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26629-26639Google Scholar). In any cell system, it does not show any significant phosphatase activity toward extracellular signal-regulated kinase. We have shown previously (5Matsuguchi T. Musikacharoen T. Johnson T.R. Kraft A.S. Yoshikai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6999-7009Google Scholar) that mkp-M gene expression is rapidly induced by LPS stimulation in mouse macrophage cell lines. Notably, it is not significantly increased by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and IL-15. Expression of a phosphatase-inactive version of MKP-M enhanced and elongated both JNK activation and TNF-α production in LPS-treated macrophages. Thus induction of MKP-M expression is at least partially responsible for the down-regulation of LPS-mediated JNK activation and TNF-α secretion in macrophages, indicating that MKP-M may have a role in preventing excessive inflammatory responses mediated by activated macrophages. To understand the transcriptional regulation of mkp-M gene in macrophages, we isolated mkp-M genomic DNA clones, identified the transcriptional initiation sites, and analyzed its 5′-upstream region. We show here that mkp-M gene expression is regulated by acetylation of histones H3 and H4 on themkp-M promoter region containing the functional E box and CRE consensus motifs. Anti-acetylhistone H3 and anti-acetylhistone H4 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). LPS from Escherichia coli serotype B5:055, trichostatin A, RPMI 1640 medium, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were obtained from Sigma. SB208530, a specific inhibitor of p38 kinase, was purchased fromCalbiochem. The mouse MKP-M cDNA containing the whole coding region was labeled with 32P by random priming and used for screening the mouse genomic phage library in Lambda Fix II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plaque hybridization was carried out as described previously (6Musikacharoen T. Matsuguchi T. Kikuchi T. Yoshikai Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4516-4524Google Scholar). Positive plaques were isolated and screened until pure clones were obtained. Phage DNAs were isolated from positive clones and characterized by enzyme restriction mapping and Southern blot analyses. Subfragments that hybridized to 5′-cDNA probe were cloned into pBlueScript II KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and were randomly sequenced by the DNA sequencer (model 373A sequencer) using EN::TN <KAN-2> insertion (Epicentre, Madison, WI) and DYEnamicTM ET terminator cycle sequencing kit (AmershamBiosciences). The nucleotide sequences upstream to the transcriptional start site were searched for the potential binding sites for transcription factors (7Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis was applied to map the initiation start site of themkp-M gene. Total RNA was prepared from LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Contaminating DNA was removed from RNA by treatment with 10 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma) for 2 h at 16 °C. Remaining RNA was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and subjected to poly (A)+ RNA purification using mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). An oligonucleotide, TCTCTTCCACCGCCCCCC, complementary to the 5′-untranslated region of the MKP-M cDNA (5Matsuguchi T. Musikacharoen T. Johnson T.R. Kraft A.S. Yoshikai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6999-7009Google Scholar), was end-labeled with 32P. The annealing of the labeled primer to poly(A)+ RNA was performed in 11 μl of 2× first strand buffer (Invitrogen) by heating the mixture of 2 pmol of labeled primer and 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA at 58 °C for 40 min and cooling to room temperature for 20 min. The reverse transcription was done by adding 9 μl of RT mix (40 mmdithiothreitol, 4 mm each of dNTP, 2 mmspermidine, 150 ng of actinomycin D, 5 μl of 2× first strand buffer, 1.5 μl of 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate) and 100 units of SuperscriptTM II (Invitrogen) into annealed primer/RNA and incubated at 42 °C for 2 h. The same primer was used in DNA sequencing on a plasmid containing 5′-flanking region of themkp-M gene with fmol® DNA sequencing systems (Promega) as the marker. The extended primer was run along with the sequencing product on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide urea gel. A series of synthesis oligonucleotide senses: CGACGCGTCTGGCTAGACCAGAACATTT (pGL3-1958), CGACGCGTGTGGGAGAGGACTAACAGAA (pGL3-1488), CGACGCGTCCTGGAACTGGAGTTACAGA (pGL3–875), CGACGCGTGCAGCTGACTAGCAGAGAGC (pGL3-252), CGACGCGTGGCTCGCGGGGACGAGCGCC (PGL3–135), and an antisense CCCTCGAGAAACGGTGATGCCCGCAGGA, derived from the respective part of the 5′-upstream region of mkp-M gene, were used to generate a series of 5′-deletion DNA fragments by Advantage®-GC2 PCR (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All PCR products were then cloned into pGEMT-easy vector (Promega) and digested with XhoI and MluI, and the inserts were subcloned into pGL3-basic vector (Promega). To generate site-directed mutagenesis, the following mutated oligonucleotides, CRE-mut 5′ CGCGGCGCTGcaCTtTTgtTCCCCGCGG, E box-mut 5′ CGGCCAGCGCtCaGCGCTGGGC, or CRE/E box-mut 5′ CGGCCAGCGCtCaGCGCTGcaCTtTTgtTCCCCGCGG, and an enzyme restriction-mutated primer SalI-mut GATAAGGATCCcTCGACCGATGCC (5′ end position is given before sequence, the binding site is underlined and altered bases are given in lowercase letters) were used to introduce specific mutations into pGL3-252 construct by TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNAs were purified from bacterial cultures using Endofree plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen). Finally, restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing confirmed all constructs. A mouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was obtained from RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% newborn calf serum (Sigma). For stable transfection, RAW264.7 cells were plated onto 60-mm plates at 1 × 106cells/plate on the day before transfection. The combination of 2 μg of mkp-M luciferase plasmid and 0.5 μg of the neomycin resistance plasmid, pcDNA3.1(+), were transfected using LipofectAMINETM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 36 h, cells were selected with 2 mg/ml geneticin (Sigma). The independent neomycin-resistant clones were isolated and maintained in the medium containing 1 mg/ml geneticin. For luciferase assays, stable RAW264.7 transfectants were trypsinized and washed twice with the cultured medium without geneticin and were plated onto 35-mm plates at 1 × 105cells/plate. Twenty four hours after plating, cells were either left untreated or treated with 1 μg/ml LPS or 100 nm/ml TSA or the combination of LPS and TSA for 8 h. Cells were then lysed, and the lysates were used for luciferase activity measurements using luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear extracts were prepared from RAW264.7 cells stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS as described previously (8Schwenzer R. Siemienski K. Liptay S. Schubert G. Peters N. Scheurich P. Schmid R.M. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19368-19374Google Scholar). A double strand DNA-comprising nucleotide −252 to −135 of mkp-M promoter amplified by PCR was radiolabeled by [γ-32P]ATP with T4 polynucleotide kinase and used as a probe. For EMSA, 5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) in a total volume of 19 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl, and 4% glycerol) for 15 min at 4 °C before ∼1 × 105 cpm of radiolabeled probe was added for another 30 min. For competition assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with a 50-fold excess of cold-targeted oligonucleotide prior to the addition of32P-labeled probe. The cold-targeted primers for the EMSA were 5′ AGCGCGCGGC for E box, 5′ TGGGCTCTTCGTCCC for CRE, or 5′ CTCCCGGAGGC for AP-2. For supershift assays, anti-CREB was incubated with nuclear extracts for 2 h before the binding reactions. The reaction mixtures were run through a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C in TBE buffer. Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. 15-μg aliquots of the total RNA were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel containing 20 mm MOPS, 5 mmsodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0), and 6% (v/v) formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane hybridization was performed as described previously (5Matsuguchi T. Musikacharoen T. Johnson T.R. Kraft A.S. Yoshikai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6999-7009Google Scholar). A 220-bp MKP-M cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 297–373 was prepared as described previously (5Matsuguchi T. Musikacharoen T. Johnson T.R. Kraft A.S. Yoshikai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6999-7009Google Scholar) and used as a probe. Acetylhistone ChIP assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Following LPS stimulation, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lysed for 10 min at 1 × 106 cells/200 μl of SDS lysis buffer. The chromatin was sheared by sonication 4 times for 10 s at one-third of the maximum power with 20 s cooling on ice between each pulse. Cross-link released chromatin fractions were pre-cleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 3 h followed by immunoprecipitation with either anti-acetylhistone H3 or anti-acetylhistone H4 overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 1 h and extracted with 1% SDS, 0.1 mNaHCO3. Histone-DNA cross-linking was reversed at 65 °C overnight and digested with 100 μg of proteinase K at 45 °C for 1 h. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform, chloroform extraction, and precipitation in the presence of 20 μg of glycerol. Finally, DNA was dissolved in 20 μl of TE buffer and subjected to PCR. PCR amplifications were carried out in a 50-μl volume containing 1.0 m GC-melt, 50 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mmof each dNTP, 10 μl of 5× GC2 PCR buffer, and 1 μl of 50× (Titanium Taq DNA polymerase, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The mkp-M promoter-specific primers are as follows: sense, GAAAAGCCCCGGATTTGGGA; antisense, CTCTCTGCTAGTCAGCTGCT. PCR conditions are as follows: 94 °C for 3 min; 94 °C for 30 s; 66 °C for 2 min; and 72 °C for 7 min. PCR was done for 20–25 cycles with mkp-M promoter-specific primers followed by 3 cycles with a [γ-32P]ATP-labeled antisense primer. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. For each reaction, 1% of cross-link released chromatin was saved and reversed at 65 °C for 6 h followed by proteinase K digestion and DNA extraction, and recovered DNA was used as input control. Nuclei preparation from RAW264.7 cells proceeded as described previously (9Weinmann A.S. Plevy S.E. Smale S.T. Immunity. 1999; 11: 665-675Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested by scraping into PBS, and pelleted at 1500 rpm. The pellet was lysed in 5 volumes of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 mm spermine, and 0.5 mm spermidine) for 10 min. Nuclei were pelleted for 5 min at 3000 rpm and washed twice with washing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm spermine, and 0.5 mm spermidine) and then nuclei were collected at 3000 rpm for 5 min. For DNase I digestion, nuclei were resuspended in DNase I digestion buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris (pH 8.0), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mmspermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mmCaCl2) at 2 × 108 nuclei/ml. 100-μl aliquots of nuclei were digested with increasing concentrations of DNase I, typically 0, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08 μg at 25 °C for 10 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 10 mm EDTA, 100 μl of DNase I digestion buffer, 100 μg of proteinase K, and 0.2% SDS and incubated at 37 °C overnight. For DNA purification, the samples were extracted once with phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform. The aqueous phase was digested with 20 μg of RNase A for 2 h at 37 °C, extracted with phenol/chloroform and chloroform, and then precipitated with ethanol, and DNA was redissolved in water. The 25-μg aliquots of genomic DNA from DNase I-treated nuclei were digested overnight with 50 units of EcoRI andSalI. Digested DNA was loaded onto 0.8% agarose gel. Gel was then soaked in denaturing buffer (0.6 m NaCl, 0.4m NaOH) for 45 min and in neutralizing buffer (1.5m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris base, 0.04 mTris-HCl) for another 45 min and transferred to a nylon membrane. As the probe for DNase I hypersensitivity, PCR product was amplified with primers sense, GGTTTCAAGTGACGCCATCT, and antisense, GTCGACAGGGATGAAGAAGTT, using de-proteinized DNA from RAW264.7 as template and labeled with 32P by random priming. The membrane was prehybridized and hybridized with the32P-labeled probe. In order to analyze the mouse mkp-M gene, a mouse genomic library was screened with MKP-M cDNA as the probe. We isolated 14 positive clones and characterized them by Southern blot analysis, restriction enzyme mapping, and nucleotide sequencing. The structure of themkp-M gene including the intron/exon junctions is schematically shown in Fig.1 A. The mkp-M gene contained 7 exons; the consensus ATG that corresponded to the translational start codon was located at the distal part of exon 2 (Fig. 1 A). Primer extension analysis was applied to map the transcriptional start site of the mkp-M gene. A synthesis oligonucleotide complementary to 5′ end of the previously reported MKP-M cDNA was hybridized to poly(A)+ RNA from LPS stimulated RAW264.7 cells and extended by reverse transcription. Two transcriptional start sites were identified by comparing the transcribed products with the sequence ladder from the same primer (Fig. 1 B). The first proximal transcriptional start site was located 229 bp upstream of the 5′ end of the cDNA described previously (5Matsuguchi T. Musikacharoen T. Johnson T.R. Kraft A.S. Yoshikai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6999-7009Google Scholar). The second transcriptional start site was 115 bp upstream to the first site. To confirm these sites, several other oligonucleotides designed from different parts of MKP-M cDNA and mkp-M genomic DNA were also used for primer extension producing compatible results (data not shown). The nucleotide of the proximal transcriptional start site was designed as +1 throughout this paper (Fig. 1 C). The nucleotide sequence upstream of the transcriptional start sites was searched for the potential binding sites of transcriptional factors using Genome Exploring and Modeling software (7Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, neither TATA nor CAAT boxes were identified in the 5′-upstream region for each transcriptional initiation site. However, the region between the two initiation sites is very rich in GCs (GC content, 78%). Because applying conventional PCR methods to this region was difficult most likely because of the high GC content, the Advantage®-GC 2 PCR kit (Clontech) was used to generate a series of 5′-deletion constructs to identify the region required formkp-M gene activation. These 5′-deletion constructs were cloned into a promoter-less luciferase reporter vector. The activities of the mkp-M promoter constructs were first determined by transient transfection into RAW264.7 cells. Each of the reporter plasmids showed the proper basal promoter function, but none showed the inducible activity by LPS (data not shown). These plasmid constructs were then stably integrated into RAW264.7 cells by co-transfecting a G418-resistant plasmid for drug selection. Several independent stable clones for each construct were isolated. In stably integrated RAW264.7 cells, some constructs showed LPS-driven induction of luciferase activities (Fig. 2 A). The highest inducible promoter activity was obtained from the longest pGL3-1958 construct. Subsequent deletion of pGL3-1958 resulted in moderately reduced promoter activity, but no significant differences were detected among those four deletion constructs (pGL3-1958, -1488, -875, and -252). In contrast, the responsiveness to LPS treatment was completely abrogated when the construct was deleted to -135 (pGL3-135). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the region between −252 and −135 seemed critical for the activation of mkp-Mpromoter by LPS. The sequence analysis within this region demonstrated the presence of consensus elements for E box, CRE, and AP-2. In order to examine the involvement of these elements in LPS responsiveness, each site was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis on the pGL3-252 wild type mkp-M promoter construct, and the mutated constructs were stably integrated into RAW264.7 cells. In stably integrated RAW264.7 cells, mutation of either E box or CRE consensus element significantly reduced fold induction by LPS. The responsiveness to LPS was completely abrogated by E box/CRE double mutation (Fig. 2 B). We next examined if DNA-protein binding within this region is involved in the activation of mkp-M promoter by EMSA. Nuclear extracts prepared from untreated and LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells were incubated with a 32P-labeled probe spanning themkp-M promoter region between −252 and −135. EMSAs revealed the presence of two protein complexes binding to the probe in an LPS-dependent manner, and the formation of the protein-DNA complexes was practically absent in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3 A). To determine the DNA sequences responsible for these complexes, cold-target competition was carried out with 50-fold excesses of E box, CRE, or AP-2 consensus nucleotide sequences. As shown in Fig. 3 A, both complexes were abrogated by the addition of 50-molar excesses of either unlabeled CRE or E box-specific oligonucleotides, whereas the other cold target consensus element tested, AP-2, was incapable of inhibiting either complex. We next addressed whether an antibody against CREB could modify the protein-DNA complexes. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the inducible protein complexes were efficiently shifted with the anti-CREB antibody, indicating that both DNA-protein complexes contain CREB as a component. Furthermore, synthetic oligonucleotides specific to CRE and E box also formed protein-DNA complexes when they were incubated with nuclear extracts from LPS-treated RAW264.7 (Fig. 3 C). In contrast their mutated versions did not. These results strongly indicated that both CRE and E box consensus sequences are functional as binding sites for transcriptional factors. Transcriptional activation of a gene is often accompanied by chromatin remodeling leading to the appearance of DNase I hypersensitivity (HS) sites (10Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Google Scholar, 11Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Google Scholar, 12Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1-16Google Scholar). Thus we searched for the HS site in the MKP-M 5′-regulatory region before and after LPS stimulation. The increasing amounts of DNase I was used to cleave the nuclei from RAW264.7 cells, and then the genomic DNA was completely digested with EcoRI and SalI and subjected to Southern blot analysis. The probe used for the assay was derived from the 3′ end of the 5-kb genomic EcoRI/SalI fragment containing the mkp-M promoter region. As shown in Fig. 4, two smaller DNA fragments were observed by Southern probe only in the LPS-treated cells. By determining the size of these DNA fragments, the regions of HS were around −1500 and −220 from the proximal transcriptional start site. Although the contribution of the −1500 HS in the MKP-M transcription is not clear, the site around −220 coincides with the locations of E box and CREB-binding sites. Restructuring of the chromatin is often associated with histone acetylation. In order to determine a possible role of histone modification in the regulation of mkp-M gene activation, we treated RAW264.7 cells with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), and we investigated its effects onmkp-M gene expression. In the Northern blot analysis, MKP-M mRNA level was potently increased by TSA treatment (Fig.5 A). This result prompted us to investigate the effect of TSA on mkp-M promoter activity by treating RAW264.7 stable clones with TSA. Consistent with Northern blot analysis, TSA treatment of RAW264.7 cells with MKP-M luciferase reporters (pGL3-1958, -1488, -875, and -252) stably integrated resulted in the induction of luciferase activity 5–6-fold over untreated cells. The induction was completely lost for the shortest promoter construct, pGL3-135 (Fig. 5 B). As in LPS stimulation, the responsiveness to TSA treatment was also significantly reduced by the mutation of either E box or CRE-binding element (Fig. 5 C). Moreover, combined treatment of these cells with TSA and LPS increased the fold induction of the luciferase activity in an additional manner (Fig. 5, B and C). Taken together, theses results strongly implied that histone acetylation may be involved in the regulation of mkp-M gene activation. As mentioned above, both LPS and TSA could induce themkp-M promoter-mediated luciferase activation when reporter plasmids were stably integrated but not when they were transiently transfected in RAW264.7 cells. It may be because transiently transfected necked DNA was not efficiently packed into chromatin, as it is well established that modifying chromatin structure through acetylation of histone needs proper chromatin structure. In order to determine whether histone acetylation actually occurs at the endogenousmkp-M gene, we utilized ChIP assay using antibodies specific to acetylhistone H3 or acetylhistone H4. The presence of themkp-M gene in the immunoprecipitated chromatin was analyzed by PCR using a pair of radiolabeled primers specific to the CREB/E box-binding region (Fig. 6 A). The ChIP assay results showed that LPS stimulation potently induced the acetylation of both histone H3 and H4 at the mkp-M promoter, whereas neither acetylated histone H3 nor H4 was detected in non-stimulated cells (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that the regulation of the endogenous mkp-M gene activation is associated with the acetylation of histone H3 and H4 at themkp-M promoter. To confirm the specificity of our ChIP assay results, we determined the acetylation level of histone H3 and H4 on the mkp-M gene more 5′-upstream of the E box/CREB-binding region (Fig. 6 A). A pair of primers specific to the −1970 to −1755 of themkp-M gene were used to analyze the acetylation status of histone H3 and H4 using the same DNA templates. Although the basal acetylation of histone H3 and H4 was detected, LPS stimulation did not increase their acetylation at this region (Fig. 6 B). These results, along with the HS data (Fig. 4), indicate that acetylation of histones and chromatin remodeling occurs at a short stretch of DNA around the E box/CRE site. We reported previously that p38 MAPK is necessary for LPS-mediated mkp-M gene expression in RAW264.7 cells using a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB208530 (5Matsuguchi T. Musikacharoen T. Johnson T.R. Kraft A.S. Yoshikai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6999-7009Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibition of p38 MAPK pathway had any effect on LPS-inducedmkp-M promoter, we pretreated RAW264.7 stable clones of reporter construct with SB208530. As expected, the inhibition of p38 MAPK pathway by pretreatment of the stable clones with SB208530 completely abrogated mkp-M promoter-driven luciferase activity by LPS (Fig. 7 A). Thus the activation o"

In addition, DNA repair generhp6, which plays a role in post-replication DNA repair and ubiquitination of proteins including histones, is also involved in silencing, albeit in a unique way; its effect on silencing and chromatin structure of the donor loci is dependent on their switching competence. Earlier, we hypothesized the existence of a mediator of Rhp6 that plays a role in reestablishment of the chromatin structure coincidentally with DNA replication associated with mating-type switching. Here we report the identification of a 22-kDa protein as anin vivo target and mediator of Rhp6 in mating-type silencing. The level of this protein is greatly elevated insng1-1/rhp6− mutant andrhp6Δ as compared with wild type strain. Both the deletion and overexpression of the gene encoding this protein elicit switching-dependent loss of silencing. Furthermore, the 22-kDa protein undergoes Rhp6-dependent multiubiquitination and associates with mat2 locus during S phase in wild type cells. Interestingly, it contains a histone-fold motif similar to that of histone H2A, and like histone H2A, it interacts strongly with histone H2B in vitro. These results indicate that the 22-kDa protein, renamed as the ubiquitinated histone-like protein Uhp1, is an in vivo target/mediator of Rhp6 in silencing. Thus, regulation of association of Uhp1 with chromatin and ubiquitination followed by degradation may play a role in reestablishment of inactive chromatin structure at the silent mating-type loci.

Mating-type silencing in two distantly related yeasts,Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, occurs by analogous mechanisms with the participation of cis-acting DNA sequences that flank the silent loci and trans-acting factors (1Herskowitz I.

Genetic and biochemical studies have shown a role of interaction between the N terminus of histone H4 and SIR3 in silencing (6Kayne P.S. Kim U. Han M. Mullen J.R. Yoshizaki F. Grunstein M. Cell. 1988; 55: 27-39Google Scholar, 7Johnson L.M. Kayne P.S. Kahn E.S. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6286-6290Google Scholar, 8Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl B.D. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Google Scholar). In parallel studies, mutations in origin recognition complex subunits were found to result in loss of silencing (9Bell S.P. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Science. 1993; 262: 1844-1849Google Scholar, 10Foss M. McNally F.J. Laurenson P. Rine J. Science. 1993; 262: 1838-1844Google Scholar, 11Li J.J. Herskowitz I.

These results, together with the earlier work of Miller and Nasmyth (13Miller A.M. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1984; 312: 247-251Google Scholar) and Rivier and Rine (14Rivier D.H. Rine J. Science. 1992; 256: 659-663Google Scholar), suggested a coupling between establishment of silent chromatin structure and DNA replication. In addition, mutations in yeast homologues of chromatin assembly factor also cause a defect in silencing (15Enomoto S. Berman J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 219-232Google Scholar, 16Enomoto S. Mclune-Zierath P.D. Gerami-Nejad M. Samdero M.A. Berman J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 358-370Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that DNA replication could be decoupled from silencing in strains where SIR1 protein could be recruited artificially (17Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. Science. 2001; 291: 646-650Google Scholar, 18Li Y.-C. Cheng T.-H. Gartenberg M.R. Science. 2001; 291: 650-653Google Scholar), rather than by origin recognition complex (19Triolo T. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1996; 381: 251-253Google Scholar). In S. pombe, mutations in swi6,clr1–clr4, clr6, and rik1 have been shown to abrogate silencing (20Lorentz A. Heim L. Schmidt H. Mol. Gen.

Swi6p contains the conserved chromodomain and chromo-shadow domain (20Lorentz A. Heim L. Schmidt H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 436-442Google Scholar). Likewise, Clr4p contains the SET domain (25Ivanova A.V. Bonaduce M.J. Ivanov S.V. Klar A.J.S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 192-195Google Scholar), which is associated with methyltransferase activity directed toward Lys-9 in histone H3 (26Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carrol D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M.

An orthologue of SIR2 has also been found in S. pombeindicating the conservation of heterochromatin components in these two yeasts and higher eukaryotes (28Freeman-Cook L.L. Sherman J.M. Brachmann C.B. Allshire R. Boeke J.D. Pillus R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3171-3186Google Scholar, 29Sherman J.M. Stone E.M. Freeman-Cook L.L. Brachmann C.B. Boeke J.D. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3045-3059Google Scholar). Among cis-acting sequences, the K region spanning themat2-mat3 interval is required for establishing a switching/silencing-competent state (30Grewal S.I. Klar A.J.S. Cell. 1996; 86: 95-101Google Scholar). Strains deleted for this region, which includes a stretch of strong homology to the centromere repeats (31Grewal S.I. Klar A.J.S. Genetics. 1997; 141: 1221-1228Google Scholar), exhibit two alternative states of switching and silencing of a ura4+ reporter gene, which are not only stably inherited mitotically but also segregate as “Mendelian” epi-alleles during meiosis (30Grewal S.I. Klar A.J.S. Cell. 1996; 86: 95-101Google Scholar). Furthermore, the dosage of Swi6 is critical for maintenance of these alternative epi-alleles (32Nakayama J. Klar A.J.S. Grewal S.I. Cell. 2000; 101: 307-317Google Scholar). More importantly, the requirement of cis-acting sequences with autonomous replication sequence-like function, for silencing (33Ekwall K. Nielsen O. Ruusala T. Yeast. 1991; 7: 745-755Google Scholar, 34Olsson T. Ekwall K. Ruusala T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 855-861Google Scholar), suggests an involvement of DNA replication in silencing in S. pombe. Very recently, DNA polymerase α has been shown to play a role in establishment of epigenetic chromosomal state, which is stably propagated during mitosis and meiosis (35Ahmed S. Singh J. Curr. Sci. (Bangalore). 2001; 80: 1337-1343Google Scholar), through interaction with the chromodomain protein Swi6. Thus, polα may play a role in silencing presumably through recruitment of Swi6 (35Ahmed S. Singh J. Curr. Sci. (Bangalore). 2001; 80: 1337-1343Google Scholar, 36Nakayama J. Allshire R.C. Klar A.J.S. Grewal S.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2857-2866Google Scholar), indicating that DNA replication is directly coupled to the assembly of silent chromatin structure in S. pombe (36Nakayama J. Allshire R.C. Klar A.J.S. Grewal S.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2857-2866Google Scholar, 37Ahmed S. Saini S. Arora S. Singh J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47814-47821Google Scholar). It was shown recently that sng1-1, a mutation in DNA repair gene rhp6 also abrogates silencing (38Singh J. Goel V. Klar A.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5511-5522Google Scholar). However, the effect of this mutation is unique; unlike the swi6 andclr1–4 mutations (20Lorentz A. Heim L. Schmidt H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 436-442Google Scholar, 21Thon G. Klar A.J.S.

Genetics. 1994; 138: 29-38Google Scholar), it causes derepression of silent loci only if they are switching-competent (38Singh J. Goel V. Klar A.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5511-5522Google Scholar). It was proposed that Rhp6 plays a role during replication associated with switching in reestablishment of silent chromatin structure at the switching donor loci (38Singh J. Goel V. Klar A.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5511-5522Google Scholar, 39Singh J. Curr. Sci. (Bangalore). 1999; 77: 1262-1272Google Scholar). Likewise, a role of Rad6 in silencing at telomere and mating-type loci was reported in S. cerevisiae (40Huang H. Kahana A. Gottschling D.E. Prakash L. Liebman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6693-6699Google Scholar). Rad6p can ubiquitinate histones in vitro (41Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1987; 329: 131-134Google Scholar) and other proteins and target them to degradation by proteasome according to the N-end rule (42Varshavsky A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 461-478Google Scholar). Recently, in vivo RAD6-dependent ubiquitination of histone H2B has been demonstrated in S. cerevisiae (43Robzyk K. Recht J. Osley M.A. Science. 2000; 287: 501-504Google Scholar). However, this modification is essential for sporulation, not for silencing (43Robzyk K. Recht J. Osley M.A. Science. 2000; 287: 501-504Google Scholar). In mice, disruption of one of the two copies of the RAD6 homologue (HHR6B) leads to male sterility, as HHR6B-dependent chromatin modification and nucleoprotein transition during spermatogenesis fail to occur (44Roest H.P. van Klaveren J. Dewit J. van Gurp C.G. Koken M.H.M. Vermey M. van Roijen J.H. Hoogerbrugge J.W. Vreeburg J.T.M. Baarends W.M. Bootsma D. Grootegoed J.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 799-810Google Scholar). Thus, an in vivo target(s) for Rhp6/Rad6 that mediates its role in silencing remains to be discovered. We have sought to identify the hypothetical target/mediator of Rhp6 in silencing. Earlier, we proposed such a mediator to function transiently during assembly of chromatin at the silent loci, following which it is ubiquitinated and degraded (38Singh J. Goel V. Klar A.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5511-5522Google Scholar, 39Singh J. Curr. Sci. (Bangalore). 1999; 77: 1262-1272Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified a 22-kDa protein as a mediator of Rhp6; this protein contains the histone-fold motif, interacts with histone H2B in vitro, and is subject to ubiquitination in vivo. Accordingly, the protein has been renamed as ubiquitinated histone-like protein, Uhp1. Both overexpression and deletion of the uhp1 gene abrogate mating-type silencing, thus demonstrating its role as a mediator of Rhp6 in assembly of heterochromatin and silencing. Media were prepared according to Morenoet al. (45Moreno S. Klar A.J.S. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 199: 795-823Google Scholar). To check sporulation levels, strains were grown at 30 °C on PMA or PMA-leu plates (in case of selection for plasmid with LEU2 marker) for 4 days; colonies were stained with iodine for 2–3 min (45Moreno S. Klar A.J.S. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 199: 795-823Google Scholar) and photographed. For quantitation of sporulation levels, cells were examined by light microscopy, and the number of zygotic and haploid meiosis asci were counted.

Moreno Open table in a new tab Cultures of appropriate strains were grown up to log phase, harvested, and washed with Buffer A (0.02 m HEPES, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 0.625% glycerol, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Then twice the volume of Buffer B (Buffer A + 0.01 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to the pellet. In addition, protease inhibitors (20 μg each of pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin) and an equal volume of glass beads (425–600 μm diameter) were added. Cells were broken either by vortexing at 4 °C or in a homogenizer. Each 1-min cycle was followed by a 30-s incubation on ice until 80% lysis occurred (lysis of cells was checked under the microscope by adding 1% SDS). The lysed cells were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in TL-100-3 rotor of TL-100 Ultra centrifuge (BD Biosciences) or SW-41 rotor of BD Biosciences at 30,000 rpm for 45 min. Supernatant was collected, aliquoted, and frozen at −70 °C. Protein concentration was estimated according to Bradford (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using BSA as standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out essentially according to Laemmli (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Because the level of the 22-kDa protein is elevated in the rhp6− mutant, it was purified by conventional methods from the mutant strain. Total cell extract was prepared from a 4-liter culture of mutant strain grown in YEA medium at 30 °C. Fractional ammonium sulfate precipitation was done at 4 °C, and the 22-kDa protein, which was referred to as p22, was found to precipitate maximally at 40–60% ammonium sulfate concentration range. The precipitated fraction was redissolved, dialyzed, and subjected to DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, where p22 appeared in the flow-through fraction. Finally, the flow-through fraction was subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE; the p22 bands were excised and electroeluted. Upon SDS-PAGE and silver staining the protein was found to be purified to apparent homogeneity. 20 μg of the electroeluted Uhp1 was digested with V8 protease (which specifically cleaves peptide bonds at the C-group of acidic amino acid residue glutamic acid in ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 7.8, and glutamic acid and aspartic acid in sodium or potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8) in a reaction mix of 200 μl containing 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, and 1.2 μg of V8 protease at 37 °C for 24 h. The reaction mix was passed through a 5-kDa cut-off filter (Amicon). Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver-stained. The larger aliquot retained after V8 digestion was also subjected to SDS-PAGE in parallel lanes and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using 10 mm CAPS buffer. Membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue stain in 50% methanol for 5 min. The required bands were excised, destained in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid (10–20 min), washed with deionized water, dried, and subjected to microsequencing using model 470 A Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with an on-line PTH analyzer. Genes encoding histones H2A, H2B, and H3 were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with specific primers, as shown in TableII, and cloned at BamHI andEcoRI sites of the vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). Similarly, uhp1 gene was PCR-amplified using specific primers shown in Table II and cloned at the NotI site of the vector pREP-1N-3HA (a kind gift of M. Yanagida), in whichnmt1 promoter drives the expression of HA-taggeduhp1 gene. The resulting vector is called pHA-Uhp1 (TableI), in which there is an attachment of a C-terminal triple HA epitope tag to Uhp1.Table IIPrimers used in this studyPrimer nameSequenceOligo dT(8721)AAT TCT GCA GTG ATA TCT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TNotI-N-p25ATA AGA ATG CGG CCG CTT TGA TCT AAA GTG AGC ATGNotI-C-p25ATA GTT AGC GGC CGC CCT TGC GGA AAA CAG TCT TG12799GAT TAA GAG CAC CTA TTT TCT TGC C12754CAA CGG ATT ACT AAA AAC AGT TTA AATpol-α (8428)CGT TTG GAA AAA AAT CCpol-α (15596)ATG CAT GCC CGG GTT AAA GCT TCA CGA TGA AAA TAT CAG TCC Cmat3Mi (12798)CAT ACT AAT AAT GTC AGC AGA AGA Cmat3Mi (12755)CCA ATC AAC TTA ACA TGA AGC AAC TCC TGA TACH2A-N-GSTCTG AGG ATC CGG AGG TAA ATC TGG TAA GH2A-C-GSTGCA TGA ATT CCA GCT CCT GAC TAG GCT TTCH2B-N-GSTGTC AGG ATC CGC TGC TGA AAA GAA ACC CH2B-C-GSTACT GGA ATT CCT GAG CAG AAG AAG AAT ACH3-N-GSTCTG AGG ATC CGC TCG TAC TAA ACA AAC AGCH3-C-GSTGCA TGA ATT CTG AGC GTT CGC CAC GGA GUhp1-ΔHFGTC GCT ATT GTG ATT TAT GGT TAT CCT ACA CGC TACUhp1-ΔHF-CGTA GCG TGT AGG ATA ACC ATA AAT CAC AAT AGC GACUhp1-α2ΔGCT GGC ATT GAG AAA GCT AAT TAC CCT GTT GTT ACUhp1-α2Δ-CGTA ACA ACA GGG TAA TTA GCT TTC TCA ATG CCA GCact1ForTCCTACGTTGGTGATGAAGCact1RevTCCGATAGTGATAACTTGAC Open table in a new tab RNA was prepared from the required strains as described by Schmitt et al. (48Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Google Scholar). Conditions of RT-PCR for detectingmat2Pc, mat3Mi, and polα transcripts have been described earlier (38Singh J. Goel V. Klar A.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5511-5522Google Scholar). Whereas RT-PCR products ofmat2Pc and mat3Mi transcripts were detected by Southern blotting that for polα could be detected by ethidium staining, which may reflect relative abundance of their respective transcripts. Northern blotting and hybridization were performed according to Sambrook (49Sambrook J. Fritsch F.I. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 309-361Google Scholar), and the radioactive bands were quantitated on Bio-Rad Molecular Imager Fx using Quantity One version 4.2.2 software. A freshly grown single colony of Escherichia coli strain JM109 expressing recombinant plasmid was inoculated into 2–5 ml of LB-ampicillin medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C. This culture was reinoculated into 25–100 ml of LB-ampicillin medium and grown at 37 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm when theA 600 reached 0.4–0.5. Cultures were incubated further at 37 °C for 3–6 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in either PBS or TE containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicated 3–4 times at a frequency of 15–20 for 20 s each on Branson sonicator. After sonication 0.1% Triton X-100 was added, and the protein extract was collected by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. Aliquots of protein extracts were frozen at −20 °C. For raising polyclonal antibodies, rabbits were immunized with Uhp1 bands excised from SDS gel, minced in PBS, mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant (1:1 v/v), and injected subcutaneously at multiple sites on the rabbit's back. Alternatively, affinity-purified MBP-Uhp1 fusion protein was injected. Two booster injections were given with same amount of antigen mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant at weekly intervals. A week after the last injection, blood samples were collected by puncturing the ear vein, and specificity of the antibody was established by Western blotting. Western blotting was performed by using semi-dry blotter as instructed by the manufacturer (Sigma). After transfer membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in 1× PBS at 4 °C for 2–12 h. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: 1:250 for anti-Uhp1 and 1:2000 for anti-HA. Secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG) was used at 1:2000 dilution. Incubations with antibodies and substrates were performed as per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega; 20 μl of 50 mg/ml NBT, 10 μl of 50 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 40 μl of 1 m MgCl2, 1.5 ml of 1m Tris·HCl, pH 9.0, in total volume of 10 ml). Alternatively, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse/anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) was used in combination with ECL-Plus (AmershamBiosciences) detection reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions. Protein extracts prepared from E. coli cells expressing GST-histone fusion proteins were allowed to bind to glutathione-Sepharose beads in MTPBS buffer (100 mmNa2HPO4, 16 mmNaH2PO4, and 150 mm NaCl) in a reaction mix of 100 μl containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 50 μl of beads (50% v/v), and three increasing concentrations of GST-histone fusion protein for half an hour with shaking. The mixture was washed twice with MTPBS. To the above reaction mix, 150 μg of protein extract prepared fromh 90 p22Δ rhp6− strain expressing pHA-Uhp1 construct, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 1× binding buffer (5× Binding Buffer 750 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) were added. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and washed 4 times with washing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, mm EDTA). After adding 1× SDS loading dye, samples were boiled for 10 min and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. Protein extract was prepared from h 90 uhp1Δ strain expressing the plasmid pHA-Uhp1 and subjected to cross-linking at room temperature for 30 min in a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm ZnCl2, 35 μg of HA-Uhp1 extract, and 0.005 and 0.01% glutaraldehyde. The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS loading buffer. Samples were boiled and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. Ni-NTA chromatography was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). pHis-Ub vector was transformed into appropriate strains and expressed in the absence of thiamin as described earlier (50Benito J. Martin-Castellanos C. Moreno S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 482-497Google Scholar). 40 μg of protein was loaded in the input lanes, whereas 1 mg of extract was used for binding to Ni-NTA resin. Localization of Uhp1 at mat2 locus was quantitated by ChIP analysis, which was performed according to Ekwall and Partridge (51Ekwall K. Partridge J. Bickmore W. Chromosome Structural Analysis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 47-57Google Scholar), using primers 12799 and 12754 for mat2, and act1For and act1Rev foract1 gene. PCR conditions are as follows: 94 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles: 94 °C for 40 s, 51 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; and 72 °C for 5 min. Earlier, we hypothesized that a protein target of Rhp6 may participate transiently in chromatin remodeling at the silent loci during switching; thereafter it is ubiquitinated, channeled to the proteasome pathway, and degraded (38Singh J. Goel V. Klar A.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5511-5522Google Scholar,39Singh J. Curr. Sci. (Bangalore). 1999; 77: 1262-1272Google Scholar). Such a protein may be present at a low level in steady state population of wild type cells. However, insng1-1/rhp6− mutant it may accumulate because of lack of ubiquitination and degradation, and its continued association may perturb chromatin structure leading to derepression of silent cassettes (38Singh J. Goel V. Klar A.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5511-5522Google Scholar, 39Singh J. Curr. Sci. (Bangalore). 1999; 77: 1262-1272Google Scholar). To test this idea, we compared electrophoretic patterns of proteins from wild type andrhp6−/sng1-1 mutant strains grown at 30 and 36 °C. The level of a 22-kDa protein was found to be greatly elevated at 30 °C in thesng1-1/rhp6− mutant as compared with wild type strain (Fig. 1 a, compare 1st and 3rd lanes). An elevated level of the 22-kDa protein was also observed in the rhp6Δstrain. 2S. Saini, A. Naresh, and J. Singh, unpublished data. Surprisingly, however, the level of elevation was reduced at 36 °C as compared with 30 °C in rhp6− mutant (Fig.1 a, compare 3rd and 4th lanes). The reason is not clear. However, it is possible that some other ubiquitination pathway, like Hus5 (52al-Khodairy F. Enoch T. Hagan I.M. Carr A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 475-486Google Scholar), may be activated at 36 °C, which partially reduces the p22 level. The 22-kDa protein was purified by conventional methods of fractional ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and electroelution. Purified protein was subjected to microsequencing, but its N terminus was found to be blocked. Therefore, it was subjected to digestion with V8 protease, and the major proteolytic fragments were subjected to microsequencing. Two fragments of 17.5 and 13 kDa were also found to have their N termini blocked (Fig. 1 b). However, the 7.5-kDa band yielded the sequence KMHAAPKPNYPVVTL, which upon data base search was found to match completely with an internal sequence of Obr1 (Fig. 1 c) (53Turi T.G. Webster P. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24229-24236Google Scholar). This protein was found earlier (GenBankTM accession number P30821; s"

https://openalex.org/W2084257889,"Type II topoisomerases bind to DNA at the catalytic domain across the DNA gate. DNA gyrases also bind to DNA at the non-homologous C-terminal domain of the GyrA subunit, which causes the wrapping of DNA about itself. This unique mode of DNA binding allows gyrases to introduce the negative supercoils into DNA molecules. We have investigated the biochemical characteristics of<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>) gyrase.<i>S. aureus</i> gyrase is known to require high concentrations of potassium glutamate (K-Glu) for its supercoiling activity. However, high concentrations of K-Glu are not required for its relaxation and decatenation activities. This is due to the requirement of high concentrations of K-Glu for <i>S. aureus</i>gyrase-mediated wrapping of DNA. These results suggest that<i>S. aureus</i> gyrase can bind to DNA at the catalytic domain independent of K-Glu concentration, but high concentrations of K-Glu are required for the binding of the C-terminal domain of GyrA to DNA and the wrapping of DNA. Thus, salt modulates the DNA binding mode and the catalytic activity of <i>S. aureus</i> gyrase. Quinolone drugs can stimulate the formation of covalent <i>S. aureus</i> gyrase-DNA complexes, but high concentrations of K-Glu inhibit the formation of<i>S. aureus</i> gyrase-quinolone-DNA ternary complexes. In the absence of K-Glu, ternary complexes formed with<i>S. aureus</i> gyrase cannot arrest replication fork progression <i>in vitro</i>, demonstrating that the formation of a wrapped ternary complex is required for replication fork arrest by a<i>S. aureus</i> gyrase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex."

https://openalex.org/W2031378049,The New Year is expected to see the birth of an innovative European Union venture that will support clinical trials of treatments for three of Africas most devastating diseases: AIDS tuberculosis and malaria. European governments and institutions are likely to commit €600 million (US$620 million) to the venture over five years. Yet some observers are worried that the planned European-Developing Countries Clinical Trials Programme (EDCTP) could stumble in the face of resistance from established national programmes and confusion about its innovative pan-European approach to research support.
