https://openalex.org/W4286492761,"This investigator-initiated, phase 2, single-arm trial primarily assessed the efficacy of G47∆, a triple-mutated, third-generation oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1, in 19 adult patients with residual or recurrent, supratentorial glioblastoma after radiation therapy and temozolomide (UMIN-CTR Clinical Trial Registry UMIN000015995). G47Δ was administered intratumorally and repeatedly for up to six doses. The primary endpoint of 1-yr survival rate after G47∆ initiation was 84.2% (95% confidence interval, 60.4-96.6; 16 of 19). The prespecified endpoint was met and the trial was terminated early. Regarding secondary endpoints, the median overall survival was 20.2 (16.8-23.6) months after G47∆ initiation and 28.8 (20.1-37.5) months from the initial surgery. The most common G47∆-related adverse event was fever (17 of 19) followed by vomiting, nausea, lymphocytopenia and leukopenia. On magnetic resonance imaging, enlargement of and contrast-enhancement clearing within the target lesion repeatedly occurred after each G47∆ administration, which was characteristic to this therapy. Thus, the best overall response in 2 yr was partial response in one patient and stable disease in 18 patients. Biopsies revealed increasing numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD4+/CD8+ lymphocytes and persistent low numbers of Foxp3+ cells. This study showed a survival benefit and good safety profile, which led to the approval of G47∆ as the first oncolytic virus product in Japan."

Machine learning-based early warning systems may reduce the time to recognition, but few systems have undergone clinical evaluation. In this prospective, multi-site cohort study, we examined the association between patient outcomes and provider interaction with a deployed sepsis alert system called the Targeted Real-time Early Warning System (TREWS). During the study, 590,736 patients were monitored by TREWS across five hospitals. We focused our analysis on 6,877 patients with sepsis who were identified by the alert before initiation of antibiotic therapy. Adjusting for patient presentation and severity, patients in this group whose alert was confirmed by a provider within 3 h of the alert had a reduced in-hospital mortality rate (3.3%, confidence interval (CI) 1.7, 5.1%, adjusted absolute reduction, and 18.7%, CI 9.4, 27.0%, adjusted relative reduction), organ failure and length of stay compared with patients whose alert was not confirmed by a provider within 3 h. Improvements in mortality rate (4.5%, CI 0.8, 8.3%, adjusted absolute reduction) and organ failure were larger among those patients who were additionally flagged as high risk. Our findings indicate that early warning systems have the potential to identify sepsis patients early and improve patient outcomes and that sepsis patients who would benefit the most from early treatment can be identified and prioritized at the time of the alert Prospective evaluation of a machine learning-based early warning system for sepsis, deployed at five hospitals, showed that interaction of health-care providers with the system was associated with better patient outcomes, including reduced in-hospital mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4286203125,"Drugs that directly impede the function of driver oncogenes offer exceptional efficacy and a therapeutic window. The recently approved mutant selective small-molecule cysteine-reactive covalent inhibitor of the G12C mutant of K-Ras, sotorasib, provides a case in point. KRAS is the most frequently mutated proto-oncogene in human cancer, yet despite success targeting the G12C allele, targeted therapy for other hotspot mutants of KRAS has not been described. Here we report the discovery of small molecules that covalently target a G12S somatic mutation in K-Ras and suppress its oncogenic signaling. We show that these molecules are active in cells expressing K-Ras(G12S) but spare the wild-type protein. Our results provide a path to targeting a second somatic mutation in the oncogene KRAS by overcoming the weak nucleophilicity of an acquired serine residue. The chemistry we describe may serve as a basis for the selective targeting of other unactivated serines."
https://openalex.org/W4286489005,"Endometriosis is characterized by the growth of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus. It affects many women during their reproductive age, causing years of pelvic pain and potential infertility. Its pathophysiology remains largely unknown, which limits early diagnosis and treatment. We characterized peritoneal and ovarian lesions at single-cell transcriptome resolution and compared them to matched eutopic endometrium, unaffected endometrium and organoids derived from these tissues, generating data on over 122,000 cells across 14 individuals. We spatially localized many of the cell types using imaging mass cytometry. We identify a perivascular mural cell specific to the peritoneal lesions, with dual roles in angiogenesis promotion and immune cell trafficking. We define an immunotolerant peritoneal niche, fundamental differences in eutopic endometrium and between lesion microenvironments and an unreported progenitor-like epithelial cell subpopulation. Altogether, this study provides a holistic view of the endometriosis microenvironment that represents a comprehensive cell atlas of the disease in individuals undergoing hormonal treatment, providing essential information for future therapeutics and diagnostics. Using single-cell analysis, Tan et al. map the cellular and spatial hierarchy and heterogeneity of eutopic endometrium and characterize ectopic peritoneal and ovarian endometriosis lesions from individuals receiving hormone treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4286203435,"Abstract Reversible protein phosphorylation is an important mechanism for regulating (dis)assembly of biomolecular condensates. However, condensate-specific phosphosites remain largely unknown, thereby limiting our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we combine solubility proteome profiling with phosphoproteomics to quantitatively map several hundred phosphosites enriched in either soluble or condensate-bound protein subpopulations, including a subset of phosphosites modulating protein–RNA interactions. We show that multi-phosphorylation of the C-terminal disordered segment of heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (HNRNPA1), a key RNA-splicing factor, reduces its ability to locate to nuclear clusters. For nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), an essential nucleolar protein, we show that phosphorylation of S254 and S260 is crucial for lowering its partitioning to the nucleolus and additional phosphorylation of distal sites enhances its retention in the nucleoplasm. These phosphorylation events decrease RNA and protein interactions of NPM1 to regulate its condensation. Our dataset is a rich resource for systematically uncovering the phosphoregulation of biomolecular condensates."
https://openalex.org/W4286203265,"Chemoproteomics has emerged as a key technology to expand the functional space in complex proteomes for probing fundamental biology and for discovering new small-molecule-based therapies. Here we report a modification-centric computational tool termed pChem to provide a streamlined pipeline for unbiased performance assessment of chemoproteomic probes. The pipeline starts with an experimental setting for isotopically coding probe-derived modifications that can be automatically recognized by pChem, with masses accurately calculated and sites precisely localized. pChem exports on-demand reports by scoring the profiling efficiency, modification homogeneity and proteome-wide residue selectivity of a tested probe. The performance and robustness of pChem were benchmarked by applying it to eighteen bioorthogonal probes. These analyses reveal that the formation of unexpected probe-derived modifications can be driven by endogenous reactive metabolites (for example, bioactive aldehydes and glutathione). pChem is a powerful and user-friendly tool that aims to facilitate the development of probes for the ever-growing field of chemoproteomics. pChem is a computational tool that provides a pipeline for performance assessment of chemoproteomic probes, with the ability to score the profiling efficiency, modification homogeneity and proteome-wide residue selectivity of a tested probe."
https://openalex.org/W4286697443,"In nature, biomineralization is a common phenomenon, which can be further divided into authigenic and artificially induced mineralization. In recent years, artificially induced mineralization technology has been gradually extended to major engineering fields. Therefore, by elaborating the reaction mechanism and bacteria of mineralization process, and summarized various molecular dynamics equations involved in the mineralization process, including microbial and nutrient transport equations, microbial adsorption equations, growth equations, urea hydrolysis equations, and precipitation equations. Because of the environmental adaptation stage of microorganisms in sandy soil, their reaction rate in sandy soil environment is slower than that in solution environment, the influencing factors are more different, in general, including substrate concentration, temperature, pH, particle size and grouting method. Based on the characteristics of microbial mineralization such as strong cementation ability, fast, efficient, and easy to control, there are good prospects for application in sandy soil curing, building improvement, heavy metal fixation, oil reservoir dissection, and CO 2 capture. Finally, it is discussed and summarized the problems and future development directions on the road of commercialization of microbial induced calcium carbonate precipitation technology from laboratory to field application."
https://openalex.org/W4286587234,"There are multiple hypotheses for the evolution of cognition. The most prominent hypotheses are the Social Intelligence Hypothesis (SIH) and the Ecological Intelligence Hypothesis (EIH), which are often pitted against one another. These hypotheses tend to be tested using broad-scale comparative studies of brain size, where brain size is used as a proxy of cognitive ability, and various social and/or ecological variables are included as predictors. Here, we test how robust conclusions drawn from such analyses may be. First, we investigate variation in brain and body size measurements across >1000 bird species. We demonstrate that there is substantial variation in brain and body size estimates across datasets, indicating that conclusions drawn from comparative brain size models are likely to differ depending on the source of the data. Following this, we subset our data to the Corvides infraorder and interrogate how modelling decisions impact results. We show that model results change substantially depending on variable inclusion, source and classification. Indeed, we could have drawn multiple contradictory conclusions about the principal drivers of brain size evolution. These results reflect concerns from a growing number of researchers that conclusions drawn from comparative brain size studies may not be robust. We suggest that to interrogate hypotheses of cognitive evolution, a fruitful way forward is to focus on testing cognitive performance within and between closely related taxa, with an emphasis on understanding the relationship between informational uncertainty and cognitive evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4286587192,"Successful recruitment of invertebrate larvae to reef substrates is essential to the health of tropical coral reef ecosystems and to their capacity to recover from disturbances. Crustose calcifying red algae (CCRA) are a species rich group of seaweeds that have been identified as important recruitment substrates for scleractinian corals. Most studies on the settlement preference of coral larvae on CCRA use morphological species identifications that can lead to unreliable species identification and do not allow for examining species-specific interactions between coral larvae and CCRA. Accurate identifications of CCRA species is important for coral reef restoration and management to assess CCRA community composition and to detect CCRA species that are favored as coral recruitment substrates. In this study, DNA sequence analysis, was used to identify CCRA species to (1) investigate the species richness and community composition of CCRA on experimental coral recruitment tiles and (2) assess if the coral Acropora surculosa preferred any of these CCRA species as recruitment substrates. The CCRA community assemblages on the coral recruitment tiles was species-rich, comprising 27 distinct CCRA species of the orders Corallinales and Peyssonneliales which constitute new species records for Guam. Lithophylloideae sp. 1 (Corallinales) was the CCRA species that was significantly favored by coral larvae as a recruitment substrate. Lithophylloideae sp. 1 showed to hold a valuable ecological role for coral larval recruitment preference. Lithophylloideae sp. 1 had the highest benthic cover on the recruitment tiles and contained most A. surculosa recruits. DNA barcoding revealed a high taxonomic diversity of CCRA species on a microhabitat scale and provided detailed insight into the species-specific ecological interactions between CCRA and corals. With a steady decline in coral cover, detailed information on species interactions that drive reef recovery is valuable for the planning of marine management actions and restoration efforts."
https://openalex.org/W4286587718,"Congenital anomalies are a leading cause of childhood morbidity, but little is known about the long-term outcomes.To quantify the burden of disease in childhood for children with congenital anomalies by assessing the risk of hospitalisation, the number of days spent in hospital and proportion of children with extended stays (≥10 days).European population-based record-linkage study in 11 regions in eight countries including children with congenital anomalies (EUROCAT children) and without congenital anomalies (reference children) living in the same regions. The children were born between 1995 and 2014 and were followed to their tenth birthday or 31/12/2015. European meta-analyses of the outcome measures were performed by two age groups, <1 year and 1-4 years.99,416 EUROCAT children and 2,021,772 reference children were linked to hospital databases. Among EUROCAT children, 85% (95%-CI: 79-90%) were hospitalised in the first year and 56% (95%-CI: 51-61%) at ages 1-4 years, compared to 31% (95%-CI: 26-37%) and 25% (95%-CI: 19-31%) of the reference children. Median length of stay was 2-3 times longer for EUROCAT children in both age groups. The percentages of children with extended stays (≥10 days) in the first year were 24% (95%-CI: 20-29%) for EUROCAT children and 1% (95%-CI: 1-2%) for reference children. The median length of stay varied greatly between congenital anomaly subgroups, with children with gastrointestinal anomalies and congenital heart defects having the longest stays.Children with congenital anomalies were more frequently hospitalised and median length of stay was longer. The outlook improves after the first year. Parents of children with congenital anomalies should be informed about the increased hospitalisations required for their child's care and the impact on family life and siblings, and they should be adequately supported."
https://openalex.org/W4286587527,"This investigation examined how dispositional compassion and empathy were associated with prosocial behaviors and attitudes in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Every two weeks from March 22 to June 15, 2020, we fielded a survey to a new cohort of adults in the U.S. Compassion related to whether one stayed home to protect others, more hours spent staying home and distancing from others, and more frequent mask wearing in public, in the past two weeks. Compassion also related to greater perceived ability to help others who were negatively affected. Empathy related to more endorsement of understanding others’ fear of COVID-19, and less endorsement of the view that others were overreacting to COVID-19. There was an interaction between empathy and political ideology, suggesting that empathy may matter for understanding others’ fear among those with more conservative-leaning beliefs. Empathy also related to greater understanding that sheltering-in-place helps prevent the spread of COVID-19. Findings suggest that messaging and interventions to increase compassion and empathy may promote public health behaviors during a pandemic regardless of political orientation. Targeting empathy may be one way to reach individuals with more conservative political beliefs, and it is important to use an evidence-based approach accounting for political party differences in motivated reasoning."
https://openalex.org/W4286587321,"Acquired loss of hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin)-producing neurons causes the chronic sleep disorder narcolepsy-cataplexy. Orexin replacement therapy using orexin receptor agonists is expected as a mechanistic treatment for narcolepsy. Orexins act on two receptor subtypes, OX1R and OX2R, the latter being more strongly implicated in sleep/wake regulation. However, it has been unclear whether the activation of only OX2R, or both OX1R and OX2R, is required to replace the endogenous orexin functions in the brain. In the present study, we examined whether the selective activation of OX2R is sufficient to rescue the phenotype of cataplexy and sleep/wake fragmentation in orexin knockout mice. Intracerebroventricular [Ala11, D-Leu15]-orexin-B, a peptidic OX2R-selective agonist, selectively activated OX2R-expressing histaminergic neurons in vivo, whereas intracerebroventricular orexin-A, an OX1R/OX2R non-selective agonist, additionally activated OX1R-positive noradrenergic neurons in vivo. Administration of [Ala11, D-Leu15]-orexin-B extended wake time, reduced state transition frequency between wake and NREM sleep, and reduced the number of cataplexy-like episodes, to the same degree as compared with orexin-A. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular orexin-A but not [Ala11, D-Leu15]-orexin-B induced drug-seeking behaviors in a dose-dependent manner in wild-type mice, suggesting that OX2R-selective agonism has a lower propensity for reinforcing/drug-seeking effects. Collectively, these findings provide a proof-of-concept for safer mechanistic treatment of narcolepsy-cataplexy through OX2R-selective agonism."
https://openalex.org/W4286587602,"Epilepsy is a disorder in which nerve cell activity in the brain is disturbed, causing seizures. It may result from a genetic condition and occurs mainly in children, especially at a primary level. Most people living with Epilepsy suffer from stigma and discrimination because of a lack of knowledge regarding Epilepsy. This study aims to develop life skills education guidelines for primary school learners of Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces to educate learners about Epilepsy, thus decreasing stigma and discrimination. A multimethod research approach will be used in this study to fulfil its purpose. Both stages 1 and 2 of the empirical phase (phase 1) will employ an exploratory-descriptive study design focusing on the primary school teachers, life skills educational advisors and learners to obtain their perceptions or views regarding the need to include Epilepsy in life skills education. Data will be collected using individual interviews for life skill educational advisors and focus group discussions for teachers and learners at the sampled primary schools in Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces. Phase two will conceptualise the phase 1 findings into the conceptual framework, and phase 3 will develop and validate the life skills guideline. This study will adhere to both internal and external ethical considerations. Recommendations will be made based on the findings of the study."
https://openalex.org/W4286486144,"Structural alterations or quantitative abnormalities of some mitochondrial ion channels and exchangers are associated with altered neuronal functions and increased susceptibility to mental illness. Here we have assessed levels of functionally prominent mitochondrial calcium ion channel proteins in plasma neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) of living patients with first episodes of psychosis (FP) and matched controls (Cs). NDEVs were enriched with an established method of precipitation and immunoabsorption by anti-human CD171 neural adhesion protein (L1CAM) antibody and extracted proteins quantified with ELISAs. CD81 exosome marker-normalized NDEV levels of leucine zipper EF-hand containing transmembrane 1 protein (LETM1), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M, member 4 (TRPM4), and solute carrier family 8 member B1 (SLC24A6) or mitochondrial Na+ /Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX) were significantly lower for FP patients (n = 10) than Cs (n = 10), whereas NDEV levels of voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit α-1C (CACNA-1C) were significantly higher for FP patients than Cs. Abnormal structures or mitochondrial levels of LETM1, NCLX, and CACNA-1C have been linked through analyses of individual proteins, genome-wide association studies, and whole exome protein-coding sequence studies to neurodevelopmental disorders, mental retardation, schizophrenia, and major depressive diseases. A greater understanding of the altered calcium homeostasis in schizophrenia, that is attributable to underlying mitochondrial calcium channel abnormalities, will lead to improved diagnosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4286488152,"Mechanosensors control muscle integrity as demonstrated in mice. However, no information is available in human muscle about the distribution of mechanosensors and their adaptations to mechanical loading and environmental conditions (hypoxia). Here, we hypothesized that mechanosensors show fiber-type-specific distributions and that loading and environmental conditions specifically regulate mechanosensors. We randomly subjected 28 healthy males to one of the following groups (n = 7 each) consisting of nine loading sessions within 3 weeks: normoxia moderate (NM), normoxia intensive (NI), hypoxia moderate (HM), and hypoxia intensive (HI). We took six biopsies: pre (T0), 4 h (T1), and 24 h (T2) after the third as well as 4 h (T3), 24 h (T4), and 72 h (T5) after the ninth training session. We analyzed subjects' maximal oxygen consumption (V̇O2max), maximal power output (Pmax), muscle fiber types and cross-sectional areas (CSA), fiber-type-specific integrin-linked kinase (ILK) localizations as well as ILK, vinculin and talin protein and gene expressions in dependence on loading and environmental conditions. V̇O2max increased upon NM and HM, Pmax upon all interventions. Fiber types did not change, whereas CSA increased upon NI and HI, but decreased upon HM. ILK showed a type 2-specific fiber type localization. ILK, vinculin, and talin protein and gene expressions differed depending on loading and environmental conditions. Our data demonstrate that mechanosensors show fiber type-specific distributions and that exercise intensities rather than environmental variables influence their profiles in human muscles. These data are the first of their kind in human muscle and indicate that mechanosensors manage the mechanosensing at a fiber-type-specific resolution and that the intensity of mechanical stimulation has a major impact."
https://openalex.org/W4286559929,"Studies have shown that the stem cell microenvironment is a key factor for stem cell maintenance or differentiation. In this study, we compared the expression of 23 cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, and TNFα between young and aged rats during patellar tendon repair by cytokine microarray, and found that significant difference between IL-10, G-CSF, and VEGF at 3, 7, or 14 days post-operatively. The effects of these factors on adipogenic differentiation of TPSCs were examined through western blot and oil red O experiments. It was shown that VEGF had an inhibitive effect on the adipogenic differentiation of TPSCs. SPP-1 was figured out as our target by RNA sequencing and confirmed by western blot in vitro. Further in vivo studies showed that adipocyte accumulation was also decreased in the tendons of aged rats after injection of VEGF and the histological score and biomechanical property were also improved via targeting SPP-1. Furthermore, histochemical results showed that vascularization of the injury sites was significantly elevated. In conclusion, VEGF not only plays an important role in decreasing adipocyte accumulation but also improves vascularization of the tendon during aged tendon healing. We believe active regulation of VEGF may improve the treatment of age-related tendon diseases and tendon injuries."
https://openalex.org/W4286560158,"Anlotinib has been demonstrated to be effective in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The response stratification of anlotinib remains unclear. In this study, plasma samples from 28 anlotinib-treated NSCLC patients (discovery cohort: 14 responders and 14 non-responders) were subjected to proteomic analysis, and plasma samples from 35 anlotinib-treated NSCLC patients (validation cohort) were subjected to validation analysis. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed on samples with different time points, namely baseline (BL), best response (BR), and progression disease (PD). Bioinformatics analysis was performed to screen for the underlying differential proteins. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect plasma ARHGDIB, FN1, CDH1, and KNG1 levels respectively. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used for biomarker-based responsive stratification. Our results indicated that differential proteins between responders and non-responders showed that proteomic technology potentially contributes to biomarker screening in plasma samples at BL. Furthermore, our results suggested that the detection of plasma ARHGDIB, FN1, CDH1, and KNG1 levels have potential predictive value for anlotinib response both in the discovery cohort and validation cohort. Collectively, this study offers novel insights into the value of plasma biomarker screening via proteomic examination and suggests that plasma ARHGDIB, FN1, CDH1, and KNG1 levels could be used as biomarkers for anlotinib stratification in NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W4286560912,"In both diurnal and nocturnal mammals, the timing of activity is regulated by the central circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN is synchronized to the external light cycle via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). To investigate potential differences in light processing between nocturnal mice and the diurnal rodent Rhabdomys pumilio, we mimicked retinal input by stimulation of the RHT ex vivo. Using Ca2+ imaging, we observed excitations as well as inhibitions of SCN neurons in response to electrical RHT stimulation. In mice, the vast majority of responses were excitatory (85%), whereas in Rhabdomys, the proportion of excitatory and inhibitory responses was similar (51% excitatory, 49% inhibitory). Glutamate blockers AP5 and CNQX blocked the excitatory responses to RHT stimulation but did not abolish the inhibitory responses in mice or Rhabdomys, indicating that the inhibitions were monosynaptically transmitted via the RHT. Simultaneous application of glutamate blockers with the GABAA antagonist gabazine blocked all inhibitory responses in mice, but not in Rhabdomys. Collectively, our results indicate that in Rhabdomys, considerably more inhibitory responses to light are present and that these responses are driven directly by the RHT. We propose that this increased proportion of inhibitory input could reflect a difference in the entrainment mechanism employed by diurnal rodents."
https://openalex.org/W4286587282,"Plants are constantly threatened by a virus infection, i.e., Potyviruses, the second largest genus of plant viruses which results in several million-dollar losses in various essential crops globally. Yam bean (Pachyrhizus erosus) is considered to be one of the essential tuberous legume crops holding a great potential source of starch. Yam Bean Mosaic Virus (YBMV) of Potyvirus group belonging to the family potyviridae affects Yam bean and several angiosperms both in the tropical and sub-tropical regions causing large economical losses in crops. In this study, we attempted to understand the sequence-structure relationship and mode of RNA binding mechanism in YBMV CP using in silico integrative modeling and all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The assembly of coat protein (CP) subunits from YBMV and the plausible mode of RNA binding were compared with the experimental structure of CP from Watermelon mosaic virus potyvirus (5ODV). The transmembrane helix region is present in the YBMV CP sequence ranging from 76 to 91 amino acids. Like the close structural-homolog, 24 CPs monomeric sub-units formed YBMV a conserved fold. Our computational study showed that ARG124, ARG155, and TYR151 orient towards the inner side of the virion, while, THR122, GLN125, SER92, ASP94 reside towards the outer side of the virion. Despite sharing very low sequence similarity with CPs from other plant viruses, the strongly conserved residues Ser, Arg, and Asp within the RNA binding pocket of YBMV CP indicate the presence of a highly conserved RNA binding site in CPs from different families. Using several bioinformatics tools and comprehensive analysis from MD simulation, our study has provided novel insights into the RNA binding mechanism in YBMV CP. Thus, we anticipate that our findings from this study will be useful for the development of new therapeutic agents against the pathogen, paving the way for researchers to better control this destructive plant virus."
https://openalex.org/W4286716353,"Theba pisana is an invasive snail pest which has established itself in San Diego County and some areas of Los Angeles County, California. The snail has grown to large populations in some areas and mitigation is becoming necessary to stop the spread of the species. In a previous study, three US strains of Phasmarhabditis species ( P . californica , P . papillosa , and P . hermaphrodita ) effectively killed juvenile (0.25 gram each, 4–6 mm wide) T . pisana in laboratory conditions at 5 times (150 IJs/cm 2 ) the recommended dose. Based on laboratory assays, we demonstrated that the same three US strains of Phasmarhabditis can effectively kill larger adult T . pisana (0.4–1.2 gram, 11.5-15mm wide) in two weeks at the same dose. The strains were more efficient at killing T . pisana than the compared molluscicide Sluggo Plus®. Results further showed that the most virulent P . californica did not effectively kill T . pisana at lower doses of 30 IJs/cm 2 and 90 IJs/cm 2 . Additional research is needed to develop the most efficient means of application of Phasmarhabditis to mitigate T . pisana in the field."
https://openalex.org/W4286586599,"Enteric fever infections remain a significant public health issue, with up to 20 million infections per year. Increasing rates of antibiotic resistant strains have rendered many first-line antibiotics potentially ineffective. Genotype 4.3.1 (H58) is the main circulating lineage of S. Typhi in many South Asian countries and is associated with high levels of antibiotic resistance. The emergence and spread of extensively drug resistant (XDR) typhoid strains has increased the need for a rapid molecular test to identify and track these high-risk lineages for surveillance and vaccine prioritisation. Current methods require samples to be cultured for several days, followed by DNA extraction and sequencing to determine the specific lineage. We designed and evaluated the performance of a new multiplex PCR assay, targeting S. Paratyphi A as well as the H58 and XDR lineages of S. Typhi on a collection of bacterial strains. Our assay was 100% specific for the identification of lineage specific S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A, when tested with a mix of non-Typhi Salmonella and non-Salmonella strains. With additional testing on clinical and environmental samples, this assay will allow rapid lineage level detection of typhoid of clinical significance, at a significantly lower cost to whole-genome sequencing. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a SNP-based multiplex PCR assay for the detection of lineage specific serovars of Salmonella Typhi."
https://openalex.org/W4286587660,"Background A prolonged length of hospital stay during heart failure-related hospitalization results in frequent readmission and high mortality. The study was aimed to determine the length of hospital stays and associated factors among heart failure patients. Methods A prospective hospital-based cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the length of hospital stay and associated factors among heart failure patients admitted to the medical ward of the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from January 2019 to June 2020. Multiple linear regression was used to identify factors associated with length of hospital stay and reported with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI). P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant to declare the association. Result A total of 263 heart failure patients (mean age: 51.08 ± 19.24 years) were included. The mean length of hospital stay was 17.29 ± 7.27 days. Number of comorbidities (B = 1.494, p &lt; 0.001), admission respiratory rate (B = -0.242, p = 0.009), serum potassium (B = -1.525, p = 0.005), third heart sound (B = -4.118, p = 0.005), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (B = 2.494, p = 0.004), causes of acute heart failure; hypertensive heart disease (B = -6.349, p = 0.005), and precipitating factors of acute heart failure; infection (B = 2.867, p = 0.037) were significantly associated with length of hospital stay. Number of comorbidities, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and precipitating factors of AHF specifically infection were associated with a prolonged length of hospital stay. Conclusion Heart failure patients admitted to the medical ward had prolonged hospital stays. Thus, clinicians would be aware of the clinical features contributing to the longer hospital stay and implementation of interventions or strategies that could reduce the heart failure patient’s hospital stay is necessary."

https://openalex.org/W4286586337,"This paper investigates the determinants of COVID-19 infection in the first 100 days of government actions. Using a debiased LASSO estimator, we explore how different measures of government nonpharmaceutical interventions affect new infections of COVID-19 for 37 lower and middle-income countries (LMCs). We find that closing schools, stay-at-home restrictions, and contact tracing reduce the growth of new infections, as do economic support to households and the number of health care workers. Notably, we find no significant effects of business closures. Finally, infections become higher in countries with greater income inequality, higher tourist inflows, poorly educated adults, and weak governance quality. We conclude that several policy interventions reduce infection rates for poorer countries. Further, economic and institutional factors are important; thereby justifying the use, and ultimately success, of economic support to households during the initial infection period."
https://openalex.org/W4286586891,"The Orienteering Problem is a routing problem that commonly appears in mapping, transportation, distribution, and scheduling scenarios. The Orienteering Problem is a challenging NP-hard problem, such that obtaining optimal or near optimal solutions usually requires a significant amount of computation for large and even moderately large instances. As a result, existing algorithms cannot effectively be utilized for solving large Orienteering Problems in an online setting, which is often required in real-world applications where a plan has to be iteratively computed. For instance, a planner might need to adapt to changes in the scenario or in the environment (e.g., this is common in goods delivery, as well as in mobile robotic scenarios for coverage, monitoring, and surveillance). Motivated by these limitations, we propose a multi-stage clustering-based metaheuristic for tackling large Orienteering Problems in an effective, strategically controlled amount of computation time. The metaheuristic starts by decomposing the problem into smaller, independent sub-problems that are efficiently solved using an algorithm of choice, sequentially or in parallel. The obtained solutions are then merged to form a solution for the original problem, and then further optimized and processed to ensure feasibility. The metaheuristic aims to dramatically improve the computation time of a given Orienteering Problem algorithm without a significant decrease in the solution quality of that algorithm, especially for large Orienteering Problems. We have validated the effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic design through a set of computational experiments. In particular, using a state-of-the-art heuristic and an exact algorithm, we have shown that it is significantly beneficial to use the Orienteering Problem algorithm plugged into our metaheuristic, as opposed to using it as a standalone algorithm. This was found to be especially true for large problems. As a result, large instances of Orienteering Problems can be effectively tackled within reasonable time bounds even for online application scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W4286587114,"A large number of behavioral experiments have demonstrated the existence of a magnetic sense in many animal species. Further, studies with immediate gene expression markers have identified putative brain regions involved in magnetic information processing. In contrast, very little is known about the physiology of the magnetic sense and how the magnetic field is neuronally encoded. In vivo electrophysiological studies reporting neuronal correlates of the magnetic sense either have turned out to be irreproducible for lack of appropriate artifact controls or still await independent replication. Thus far, the research field of magnetoreception has little exploited the power of ex vivo physiological studies, which hold great promise for enabling stringent controls. However, tight space constraints in a recording setup and the presence of magnetizable materials in setup components and microscope objectives make it demanding to generate well-defined magnetic stimuli at the location of the biological specimen. Here, we present a solution based on a miniature vector magnetometer, a coil driver, and a calibration routine for the coil system to compensate for magnetic distortions in the setup. The magnetometer fits in common physiology recording chambers and has a sufficiently small spatial integration area to allow for probing spatial inhomogeneities. The coil-driver allows for the generation of defined non-stationary fast changing magnetic stimuli. Our ex vivo multielectrode array recordings from avian retinal ganglion cells show that artifacts induced by rapid magnetic stimulus changes can mimic the waveform of biological spikes on single electrodes. However, induction artifacts can be separated clearly from biological responses if the spatio-temporal characteristics of the artifact on multiple electrodes is taken into account. We provide the complete hardware design data and software resources for the integrated magnetic stimulation system."

The global shortage of medical and personal protective equipment (PPE) in specialized centers during the outbreak demonstrated the need for efficient methods to disinfect and recycle them in times of emergency. We have previously described that high ozone concentrations destroyed viral RNA in an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 strain within a few minutes. However, the efficient ozone dosages for active SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate the systematic effects of ozone exposure on face masks from hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Face masks from COVID-19 patients were collected and treated with a clinical ozone generator at high ozone concentrations in small volumes for short periods. The study focused on SARS-CoV-2 gene detection (assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)) and on the virus inactivation by in vitro studies. We assessed the effects of different high ozone concentrations and exposure times on decontamination efficiency. We showed that high ozone concentrations (10,000, 2,000, and 4,000 ppm) and short exposure times (10, 10, and 2 minutes, respectively), inactivated both the original strain and the B.1.1.7 strain of SARS-CoV-2 from 24 contaminated face masks from COVID-19 patients. The validation results showed that the best condition for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation was a treatment of 4,000 ppm of ozone for 2 minutes. Further studies are in progress to advance the potential applications of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W4286586279,"Introduction Peptides (B-cell epitopes) have broad applications in disease diagnosis and surveillance of pathogen exposure. In this framework, we present a pilot study to design and produce a peptide microarray for the integrated surveillance of neglected tropical diseases. The peptide microarray was evaluated against peptides derived from Ascaris lumbricoides , Necator americanus , Schistosoma haematobium , Schistosoma mansoni , Trichuris trichiura , Bacillus anthracis , Mycobacterium leprae , Wuchereria bancrofti , Rabies lyssavirus , Chlamydia trachomatis and Trypanosoma brucei . Methods S . haematobium was diagnosed using the urine filtration technique. S . mansoni , A . lumbricoides , N . americanus and T . trichiura were diagnosed using the Kato Katz and formal ether concentration techniques. Immunogenic peptides were retrieved from the Tackling Infection to Benefit Africa infectious diseases epitope microarray. Further peptides were predicted using ABCpred. IgG and IgM reactivity against the derived peptides were evaluated using peptide microarray multiplex immunoassays. Positive response was defined as fluorescence intensity ≥ 500 fluorescence units. Immunodominant peptides were identified using color-coded heat maps and bar graphs reflecting the obtained fluorescence signal intensities. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis and Mann-Whitney-U test were performed to determine the diagnostic validity of the peptides. Results Species-specific responses with at least one peptide derived from each NTD pathogen were observed. The reactive peptides included; for S . haematobium , XP_035588858.1-206-220 and XP_035588858.1-206-220 immunodominant for IgG and IgM respectively, for S . mansoni , P20287.1-58-72 immunodominant for both antibodies and for T . trichiura , CDW52482.1-326-340 immunodominant for IgG and CDW57769.1-2017-2031 and CDW57769.1-1518-1532 immunodominant for IgM. According to ROC analysis most of the peptides selected were inaccurate; with AUC &lt; 0.5. Some peptides had AUC values ranging from 0.5 to 0.5875 for both IgM and IgG suggesting no discrimination. Conclusion Multiplex peptide microarrays are a valuable tool for integrated NTDs surveillance and for screening parasites exposure in endemic areas. Species sero-reactivity observed in the study maybe indicative of exposure to the different NTDs parasites. However, although peptides with the least cross reactivity were selected there is need to validate the sero-reactivity with recombinant antigens and immune-blotting techniques such as western blotting."

Aberrations in maternal behavior were previously reported in a Mest global knockout mouse (Mesttm1Masu). In this study, we performed in-depth social and maternal behavioral testing in a mouse model of Mest inactivation developed in our laboratory (Mesttm1.2Rkz). Mice with paternal allele inactivation (MestpKO) did not show anxiety after testing in the elevated plus maze, open field trial, and marble burying; nor depression-like behaviors in the tail suspension test. MestpKO showed normal social behaviors and memory/cognition in the three-chamber box test and the novel object recognition test, respectively. Primiparous MestpKO and MestgKO (biallelic Mest inactivation) female mice exhibited normal nest building and maternal behavior; and, virgin MestpKO and MestgKO female mice showed normal maternal instinct. Analyses of gene expression in adult hypothalamus, embryonic day 14.5 whole brain and adult whole brain demonstrated full abrogation of Mest mRNA in MestpKO and MestgKO mice with no effect on miR-335 expression. Our data indicates no discernible impairments in object recognition memory, social behavior or maternal behavior resulting from loss of Mest. The basis for the differences in maternal phenotypic behaviors between Mesttm1Masu and Mesttm1.2Rkz is not known."
https://openalex.org/W4286586894,"Hunting is a prominent feature of many human societies. Advancements in hunting technologies can challenge the ethics and sustainability of hunting globally. We investigated the efficacy of an electronic acoustic lure (‘quail caller’), in attracting the otherwise difficult-to hunt stubble quail Coturnix pectoralis in Victoria, Australia. Using distance sampling, the density and abundance of stubble quail was estimated at 79 sites across a range of habitat types in an agricultural setting, each with an active ‘quail caller’ station continuously broadcasting for 48 hours, and a control station (no broadcast). Quail detectability at the active stations (62.9%) far exceeded that at control stations (6.3%). Most (57%) detections occurred within 30 m of active ‘quail callers’. Stubble quail relative abundance was substantially greater when ‘quail callers’ were broadcasting. Cameras mounted near ‘quail callers’ identified the predatory red fox as a non-target predator, although rates of attraction appear similar between active and control sites. ‘Quail callers’ are highly effective at attracting stubble quail and concentrating them to a known area, raising questions in relation to sustainable hunting practices, indirect effects, and ethical implications. ‘Quail callers’ do, however, also offer a tool for estimating quail abundance and developing more accurate population size estimates."
https://openalex.org/W4286587169,"In recent times, the study of metabolic pathways has become inevitable and predominant for a variety of research fields as cancer biology and immunology. L-lactate as a product of anaerobic glycolysis has shown to be an important indicator of the cellular metabolic status and can be associated with diverse cellular effects. For this reason, L-lactate assay kits are of high demand when metabolic effects need to be considered. Nevertheless, commercially available kits are not affordable if multiple samples must be evaluated.In this work, we develop an easy and cost-effective colorimetric assay for quantification of L-lactate suitable for cells with low or high L-lactate production based on LDH activity and suitable for 96 well-plate format. Using different metabolic regulators, we demonstrate the capacity of the assay to detect and quantify L-lactate from the supernatant of HeLa cancer cell line. Furthermore, we validate the assay against a commercially available kit by demonstrating no significant difference between both assays. Finally, we show that the assay is capable of quantifying L-lactate in primary cells such as hPBMCs that were stimulated with toll-like receptor ligands and treated with different metabolic regulators.We herein present an easy custom assay that is suitable for cells with low and high L-lactate production at very low cost compared to commercially available kits. These advantages of the custom assay can simplify the research in the field of metabolism and related fields."
https://openalex.org/W4286587173,"Purpose C ontact lenses (CL) remain a popular mode of refractive error correction globally and in the Caribbean, mostly among young people. However, no data on the characteristics of the CL population wearers in the Caribbean is available. This study reported on the characteristics of CL wearers and the associated factors in Trinidad and Tobago (T&amp;T). Methods This retrospective study reviewed the clinical records of 243 CL wearers who attended the University of the West Indies (UWI) optometry clinic between 2017 and 2018. Data on their demographic profiles, CL wearing characteristics including lens type, material, purpose of wear, replacement schedule and lens care systems were extracted and analyzed. The associations between the demographic characteristics and CL wearing characteristics were also determined. Results About half of the CL wearers used them for fashion (more among those aged 18 to 30 years, 61.0%), therapeutic (more among those &lt;18 years, 43.8%, P = 0.001) and refractive error correction purposes (more in those &gt;40 years, P = 0.001). Females were more likely to use CLs for fashion compared with males (67.0% versus 40.7%). Age ( P &lt;0.0005) and gender ( P = 0.030) were associated with the lens materials. Those aged 18–30 years were more likely use hydrogels compared with the younger ones (64.1% versus 25.0%). Rigid gas permeable (RGP) CL use was more common in males than females (21.8% versus 10.9%, P = 0.031). Daily disposables were predominantly used by younger respondents (18–30 years old, 31.3%, P &lt; 0.001) and more in females than males (66.7% vs 49.4%, P = 0.040). Conclusion The study found that the CL appears to be more commonly worn for fashion in younger females and for refractive error correction in older males. Age, gender, and employment status were the main determinants of lens wear among respondents attending the university clinic in T&amp;T."

People living with HIV-1 and infected with HTLV-1 seem more likely to progress rapidly towards AIDS. Both HTLV-1 and HIV-1 are endemic in Gabon (Central Africa). We investigated HTLV-1 and HIV-1 co-infection in the Haut-Ogooué province, and assessed factors that may favor the rapid evolution and progression to AIDS in co-infected patients.Plasma samples from HTLV-1 patients were tested using ELISA, and positive samples were then tested by western blot assay (WB). We used the polymerase chain reaction to detect HTLV-1 Tax/Rex genes using DNA extracted from the buffy coat of ELISA-positives samples.We recruited 299 individuals (mean age 46 years) including 90 (30%) men and 209 (70%) women, all of whom are under treatment at the Ambulatory Treatment Centre of the province. Of these, 45 were ELISA HTLV-1/2 seropositive. According to WB criteria, 21 of 45 were confirmed positive: 20 were HTLV-1 (44%), 1 was HTLV-1/2 (2%), 2 were indeterminate (4%) and 22 were seronegative (49%). PCR results showed that 23 individuals were positive for the Tax/Rex region. Considering both serological and molecular assays, the prevalence of HTLV-1 infection was estimated at 7.7%. Being a woman and increasing age were found to be independent risk factors for co-infection. Mean CD4+ cell counts were higher in HTLV-1/HIV-1 co-infected (578.1 (± 340.8) cells/mm3) than in HIV-1 mono-infected (481.0 (± 299.0) cells/mm3) Individuals. Similarly, the mean HIV-1 viral load was Log 3.0 (± 1.6) copies/ml in mono-infected and Log 2.3 (± 0.7) copies/ml in coinfected individuals.We described an overall high prevalence of HTLV-1/HIV-1 co-infection in Gabon.

We aimed to examine the relationship between thyroid function and lung function in a large cohort study of euthyroid subjects.We analyzed biochemical and spirometry data from a nationwide, population-based, cross-sectional survey (KNHANES VI). A total of 1,261 middle-aged participants aged 45-65 years with spirometry tests and normal thyroid function were included in this study. The subjects were grouped according to free thyroxine (fT4) (ng/dL) quartiles (Q1, 0.89-1.09; Q2, 1.10-1.19; Q3, 1.20-1.30; Q4, 1.31-1.76). Obstructive lung pattern was defined as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) <0.7. The probability of obstructive lung patterns according to fT4 quartiles was assessed using logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders.Overall, 10.9% of the subjects had an obstructive lung pattern. The mean fT4 levels were significantly higher in those with obstructive lung pattern than in those with normal lung function (1.26 vs. 1.20 ng/dL, p<0.001). The proportion of participants with obstructive lung pattern increased across the fT4 quartile categories (p<0.001). With the Q1 group as reference, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for obstructive lung pattern in the Q3 and Q4 groups were 2.875 (1.265-6.535) and 2.970 (1.287-6.854), respectively, even after adjusting for confounding variables.High fT4 levels are an independent predictor of obstructive lung pattern in euthyroid middle-aged subjects. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W4286587433,"The desert ecosystem is an important part of the terrestrial ecosystem. Accurate estimations of the biomass and species richness of desert plants are of great value for maintaining ecosystem stability; however, current assessments remain a challenge due to the large spatial heterogeneity in biomass and species richness and difficulties posed by time-consuming field surveys, particularly in remote areas. In the present study, There were 527 sampling sites, and each sampling site contained approximately 9 quadrats. Approximately 4500 quadrats in total were taken from the Junggar Desert of northern Xinjiang, and the spatial distribution and factors driving the biomass and species richness of the desert ecosystem were quantitatively analyzed. The results showed that the average aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, litter, and the Patrick index of the Junggar Desert in northern Xinjiang were 115.42 gm-2, 924.77 gm-2, 13.06 gm-2, and 63, with values ranging from 2-708.12 gm-2, 120.25-3537.3 gm-2, 2-56.46 gm-2, and 0-377, respectively, The mean of the variation coefficient was 56.19%, 41.16%, 62.16% and 73.83%, suggesting moderate variation. The result is affected by the differences between the desert environment and climate. Climate factors had a relatively large impact on species richness, and the variation coefficient of species richness was large, indicating a large degree of dispersion of species richness. The direct influence of environmental and climatic factors on underground biomass (BGB) is relatively small, and its coefficient of variation is small. The spatial distribution of biomass and species richness in northern Xinjiang gradually decreased from west to east. Redundancy analysis showed that climate was the main factor driving desert biomass and species richness in northern Xinjiang, with an average independent explanatory power of 20.38% and 18.57%, respectively. Structural equation modeling indicated that climate factors, elevation, and community coverage had a direct positive effect on the aboveground biomass of the desert plants in northern Xinjiang and a direct negative effect on the belowground biomass. Moreover, climate factors and biological factors showed a direct positive effect on the species richness in northern Xinjiang."

B38-CAP is a bacteria-derived ACE2-like carboxypeptidase as potent as human ACE2 and ameliorates hypertension, heart failure and SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury in mice. Recombinant B38-CAP is prepared with E . coli protein expression system more efficiently than recombinant soluble human ACE2. Here we show therapeutic effects of B38-CAP on abdominal sepsis- or acid aspiration-induced acute lung injury. ACE2 expression was downregulated in the lungs of mice with cecal ligation puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis or acid-induced lung injury thereby leading to upregulation of Ang II levels. Intraperitoneal injection of B38-CAP significantly decreased Ang II levels while upregulated angiotensin 1–7 levels. B38-CAP improved survival rate of the mice under sepsis. B38-CAP suppressed the pathologies of lung inflammation, improved lung dysfunction and downregulated elevated cytokine mRNA levels in the mice with acute lung injury. Thus, systemic treatment with an ACE2-like enzyme might be a potential therapeutic strategy for the patients with severe sepsis or ARDS."

We assess the cost-effectiveness of a decision to adopt an existing temporary isolation room in a Singapore setting. Method We performed a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the impact of a decision to adopt temporary isolation rooms for infection prevention. We estimated changes to the costs from implementation, the number of cases of healthcare associated infection, acute care bed days used, they money value of bed days, the number of deaths, and the expected change to life years. We report the probability that adoption was cost-effective by the cost by life year gained, against a relevant threshold. Uncertainty is addressed with probabilistic sensitivity analysis and the findings are tested with plausible scenarios for the effectiveness of the intervention. Results We predict 478 fewer cases of HAI per 100,000 occupied bed days from a decision to adopt temporary isolation rooms. This will result in cost savings of $SGD329,432 and there are 1,754 life years gained. When the effectiveness of the intervention is set at 1% of cases of HAI prevented the incremental cost per life year saved is $16,519; below the threshold chosen for cost-effectiveness in Singapore. Conclusions We provide some evidence that adoption of a temporary isolation room is cost-effective for Singapore acute care hospitals. It is plausible that adoption is a positive decision for other countries in the region who may demonstrate fewer resources for infection prevention and control."

The data was collected through five hundred questionnaires from Malaysia (the MNIS pioneer) and analyzed using structural equation modeling.The results show that females have significantly higher perceived credibility while males have significantly higher performance expectancy for MNIS. The correlation between performance expectancy and perceived credibility is significantly stronger among males.Strategies recommended to policymakers include having social messages related to MNIS utility and convenience in campaigns targeting males while alleviating concerns over security and privacy for campaigns targeting females.This is the first study that investigated the gender differences in adoption of MNIS by comparing the structural UTAUT models of both genders. The gender differences in MNIS adoption were explained using gender theories."
https://openalex.org/W4286586843,"Compositional data, which is data consisting of fractions or probabilities, is common in many fields including ecology, economics, physical science and political science. If these data would otherwise be normally distributed, their spread can be conveniently represented by a multivariate normal distribution truncated to the non-negative space under a unit simplex. Here this distribution is called the simplex-truncated multivariate normal distribution. For calculations on truncated distributions, it is often useful to obtain rapid estimates of their integral, mean and covariance; these quantities characterising the truncated distribution will generally possess different values to the corresponding non-truncated distribution. In this paper, three different approaches that can estimate the integral, mean and covariance of any simplex-truncated multivariate normal distribution are described and compared. These three approaches are (1) naive rejection sampling, (2) a method described by Gessner et al. that unifies subset simulation and the Holmes-Diaconis-Ross algorithm with an analytical version of elliptical slice sampling, and (3) a semi-analytical method that expresses the integral, mean and covariance in terms of integrals of hyperrectangularly-truncated multivariate normal distributions, the latter of which are readily computed in modern mathematical and statistical packages. Strong agreement is demonstrated between all three approaches, but the most computationally efficient approach depends strongly both on implementation details and the dimension of the simplex-truncated multivariate normal distribution. For computations in low-dimensional distributions, the semi-analytical method is fast and thus should be considered. As the dimension increases, the Gessner et al. method becomes the only practically efficient approach of the methods tested here."

Residential care workers face job demands and are prone to burnout due to the role stress of balancing enormous workloads with residents’ emotional needs. This 2-year study examined the changes in role stress, burnout, and residents’ behavioral problems, and their temporal relationships in a sample of 381 young residents and 76 workers from residential care homes in Hong Kong. The workers completed the Role Questionnaire and Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and evaluated the residents’ behavioral problems using the Child Behavior Checklist every 3 months. Latent growth modeling was used to analyze the temporal changes, and multilevel regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations between role stress and residents’ behavioral problems. The workers displayed stable trends in role stress and burnout with significant inter-individual variations in temporal changes. The residents’ total behavioral problems displayed piecewise decreasing trajectories with significant declines over the first 9 months. Controlling for baseline levels, changes in role stress showed significant and positive associations with changes in work burnout and total behavioral problems over the first 9 months. The findings provide support for the temporal relationships among role stress, work burnout, and residents’ behavioral problems in a residential care setting."
https://openalex.org/W4286586944,"Background The purpose of this study was to prospectively observe the trends of ultrashort echo time (UTE)-T2* values for the intraarticular and intraosseous regions of reconstructed anterior cruciate ligaments from 6 to 12 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by using UTE-T2* mapping, and to investigate the changes and differences over time in each region. Methods Ten patients underwent UTE-T2* mapping of the operated knee at 6, 9, and 12 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The UTE-T2* values of intraarticular and intraosseous regions of reconstructed anterior cruciate ligaments at 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively were statistically compared. Results The UTE-T2* values of the intraarticular region at 6 months postoperatively were significantly higher than those at 9 and 12 months. There were no significant differences in the UTE-T2* values at 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively in the intraosseous region. At 6 months postoperatively, the UTE-T2* values of the intraarticular region were significantly higher than those of the intraosseous region. The UTE-T2* values of the intraosseous region at the tibia were significantly lower than those of the other sites at any postoperative time point. Conclusions According to UTE-T2*mapping-based findings, histological maturation of reconstructed ACLs is faster in the intraosseous region than in the intraarticular region. In particular, the intraarticular region is still undergoing rapid histologic changes at 6 months postoperatively, and its tissue structure is less substantial than normal. The findings of this study may provide clues to determine the optimal timing for safe return to sports in terms of ligamentaization of reconstructed ACLs."
https://openalex.org/W4286587111,"The goal of the study was to investigate how variations in ripple width influence the ripple density resolution. The influence of the ripple width was investigated with two experimental paradigms: (i) discrimination between a rippled test signal and a rippled reference signal with opposite ripple phases and (ii) discrimination between a rippled test signal and a flat reference signal. The ripple density resolution depended on the ripple width: the narrower the width, the higher the resolution. For distinguishing between two rippled signals, the resolution varied from 15.1 ripples/oct at a ripple width of 9% of the ripple frequency spacing to 8.1 ripples/oct at 64%. For distinguishing between a rippled test signal and a non-rippled reference signal, the resolution varied from 85 ripples/oct at a ripple width of 9% to 9.3 ripples/oct at a ripple width of 64%. For distinguishing between two rippled signals, the result can be explained by the increased ripple depth in the excitation pattern due to the widening of the inter-ripple gaps. For distinguishing between a rippled test signal and a non-rippled reference signal, the result can be explained by the increased ratio between the autocorrelated and uncorrelated components of the input signal."

An optimal policy provides the minimum number of vaccinations required to drive post-vaccination reproduction number to below one at a desired reliability level. To generate a vaccination policy, the new method considers the uncertainty in COVID-19 related parameters such as efficacy of vaccines, age-related variation in susceptibility and infectivity to SARS-CoV-2, distribution of household composition in a community, and variation in human interactions. We report on a computational study of the new methodology on a set of neighboring U.S. counties to generate vaccination policies based on vaccine availability. The results show that to control outbreaks at least a certain percentage of the population should be vaccinated in each community based on pre-determined reliability levels. The study also reveals the vaccine sharing capability of the proposed approach among counties under limited vaccine availability. This work contributes a decision-making tool to aid public health agencies worldwide in the allocation of limited vaccines under uncertainty towards controlling epidemics through vaccinations."

Identification of predictors of poor outcomes will assist medical staff in treatment and allocating limited healthcare resources.The primary aim was to study the value of D-dimer as a predictive marker for in-hospital mortality.This was a cohort study. The study population consisted of hospitalized patients (age >18 years), who were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on real-time PCR at 9 hospitals during the first COVID-19 wave in Lombardy, Italy (Feb-May 2020). The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Information was obtained from patient records. Statistical analyses were performed using a Fine-Gray competing risk survival model. Model discrimination was assessed using Harrell's C-index and model calibration was assessed using a calibration plot.Out of 1049 patients, 507 patients (46%) had evaluable data. Of these 507 patients, 96 died within 30 days. The cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality within 30 days was 19% (95CI: 16%-23%), and the majority of deaths occurred within the first 10 days. A prediction model containing D-dimer as the only predictor had a C-index of 0.66 (95%CI: 0.61-0.71). Overall calibration of the model was very poor. The addition of D-dimer to a model containing age, sex and co-morbidities as predictors did not lead to any meaningful improvement in either the C-index or the calibration plot.The predictive value of D-dimer alone was moderate, and the addition of D-dimer to a simple model containing basic clinical characteristics did not lead to any improvement in model performance."
https://openalex.org/W4286587802,"Predictions of xenobiotic hepatic clearance in humans using in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation methods are frequently inaccurate and problematic. Multiple strategies are being pursued to disentangle responsible mechanisms. The objective of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of using insights gained from independent virtual experiments on two model systems to begin unraveling responsible mechanisms. The virtual culture is a software analog of hepatocytes in vitro, and the virtual human maps to hepatocytes within a liver within an idealized model human. Mobile objects (virtual compounds) map to amounts of xenobiotics. Earlier versions of the two systems achieved quantitative validation targets for intrinsic clearance (virtual culture) and hepatic clearance (virtual human). The major difference between the two systems is the spatial organization of the virtual hepatocytes. For each pair of experiments (virtual culture, virtual human), hepatocytes are configured the same. Probabilistic rules govern virtual compound movements and interactions with other objects. We focus on highly permeable virtual compounds and fix their extracellular unbound fraction at one of seven values (0.05-1.0). Hepatocytes contain objects that can bind and remove compounds, analogous to metabolism. We require that, for a subset of compound properties, per-hepatocyte compound exposure and removal rates during culture experiments directly predict corresponding measures made during virtual human experiments. That requirement serves as a cross-system validation target; we identify compound properties that enable achieving it. We then change compound properties, ceteris paribus, and provide model mechanism-based explanations for when and why measures made during culture experiments under- (or over-) predict corresponding measures made during virtual human experiments. The results show that, from the perspective of compound removal, the organization of hepatocytes within virtual livers is more efficient than within cultures, and the greater the efficiency difference, the larger the underprediction. That relationship is noteworthy because most in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation methods abstract away the structural organization of hepatocytes within a liver. More work is needed on multiple fronts, including the study of an expanded variety of virtual compound properties. Nevertheless, the results support the feasibility of the approach and plan."
https://openalex.org/W4286697325,"The retropepsin (PR) of the Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) plays, as in other retroviruses, a crucial role in the transition from the non-infective viral particle to the infective virion by processing the polyprotein Gag. PR is expressed as an immature precursor associated with Gag, after an occasional -1 ribosomal frameshifting event. Self-hydrolysis of PR at specific N- and C-terminal sites releases the monomer that dimerizes giving rise to the active protease. We designed a strategy to express BLV PR in E. coli as a fusion protein with maltose binding protein, with a six-histidine tag at its N-terminal end, and bearing a tobacco etch virus protease hydrolysis site. This allowed us to obtain soluble and mature recombinant PR in relatively good yields, with exactly the same amino acid composition as the native protein. As PR presents relative promiscuity for the hydrolysis sites we designed four fluorogenic peptide substrates based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in order to characterize the activity of the recombinant enzyme. These substrates opened the way to perform kinetic studies, allowing us to characterize the dimer-monomer equilibrium. Furthermore, we obtained kinetic evidence for the existence of a conformational change that enables the interaction with the substrate. These results constitute a starting point for the elucidation of the kinetic properties of BLV-PR, and may be relevant not only to improve the chemical warfare against this virus but also to better understand other viral PRs."
