https://openalex.org/W2081753893,"We isolated a cDNA encoding a functional human thrombin receptor by direct expression cloning in Xenopus oocytes. mRNA encoding this receptor was detected in human platelets and vascular endothelial cells. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed a new member of the seven transmembrane domain receptor family with a large amino-terminal extracellular extension containing a remarkable feature. A putative thrombin cleavage site (LDPR/S) resembling the activation cleavage site in the zymogen protein C (LDPR/I) was noted 41 amino acids carboxyl to the receptor's start methionine. A peptide mimicking the new amino terminus created by cleavage at R41 was a potent agonist for both thrombin receptor activation and platelet activation. ""Uncleavable"" mutant thrombin receptors failed to respond to thrombin but were responsive to the new amino-terminal peptide. These data reveal a novel signaling mechanism in which thrombin cleaves its receptor's amino-terminal extension to create a new receptor amino terminus that functions as a tethered ligand and activates the receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1973108213,"We assessed the pathways by which excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters elicit postsynaptic changes in [Ca2+]i in brain slices of developing rat and cat neocortex, using fura 2. Glutamate, NMDA, and quisqualate transiently elevated [Ca2%]i in all neurons. While the quisqualate response relied exclusively on voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, almost all of the NMDA-induced Ca2+ influx was via the NMDA ionophore itself, rather than through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Glutamate itself altered [Ca2+]i almost exclusively via the NMDA receptor. Furthermore, synaptically induced Ca2+ entry relied almost completely on NMDA receptor activation, even with low-frequency stimulation. The inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA also increased [Ca2+]i, probably via voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, whereas the neuromodulator acetylcholine caused Ca2+ release from intracellular stores via a muscarinic receptor. Low concentrations of these agonists produced nonperiodic [Ca2+]i oscillations, which were temporally correlated in neighbouring cells. Optical recording with Ca2(+)-sensitive indicators may thus permit the visualization of functional networks in developing cortical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2134352843,"The T cell-specific transmembrane glycoprotein CD4 interacts with class II MHC molecules via its external domain and is associated with tyrosine kinase p56lck via a cysteine motif in its cytoplasmic domain. We have assessed the ability of CD4 to synergize with the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) for induction of transmembrane signals that result in lymphokine production. Mutant CD4 molecules were introduced into T cells that lacked endogenous CD4 but expressed TCRs specific for lysozyme peptides or the superantigen SEA bound to Ab or Abm12 class II MHC molecules. With either ligand, T cell activation occurred only when CD4 was associated with p56lck. These results demonstrate that residues within the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 are required for its coreceptor function in TCR-mediated signal transduction and strongly support the notion that the association of CD4 with p56lck is critical in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2054244592,"The two mouse genes, En-1 and En-2, that are homologs of the Drosophila segmentation gene engrailed, show overlapping spatially restricted patterns of expression in the neural tube during embryogenesis, suggestive of a role in regional specification. Mice homozygous for a targeted mutation that deletes the homeobox were viable and showed no obvious defects in embryonic development. This may be due to functional redundancy of En-2 and the related En-1 gene product during embryogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, the mutant mice showed abnormal foliation in the adult cerebellum, where En-2, and not En-1, is normally expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1589132235,"Eukaryotic DNA polymerase delta and its accessory proteins are essential for SV40 DNA replication in vitro. A multi-subunit protein complex, replication factor C (RF-C), which is composed of subunits with apparent molecular weights of 140,000, 41,000, and 37,000, has primer/template binding and DNA-dependent ATPase activities. UV-cross-linking experiments demonstrated that the Mr = 140,000 subunit recognizes and binds to the primer-template DNA, whereas the Mr = 41,000 polypeptide binds ATP. Assembly of a replication complex at a primer-template junction has been studied in detail with synthetic, hairpin DNAs. Following glutaraldehyde fixation, a gel shift assay demonstrated that RF-C alone forms a weak binding complex with the hairpin DNA. Addition of ATP or its nonhydrolyzable analogue, ATP gamma S, increased specific binding to the DNA. Footprinting experiments revealed that RF-C recognizes the primer-template junction, covering 15 bases of the primer DNA from the 3'-end and 20 bases of the template DNA. Another replication factor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) binds to RF-C and the primer-template DNA forming a primer recognition complex and extends the protected region on the duplex DNA. This RF-C.PCNA complex has significant single-stranded DNA binding activity in addition to binding to a primer-template junction. However, addition of another replication factor, RF-A, completely blocked the nonspecific, single-stranded DNA binding by the RF-C.PCNA complex. RF-A therefore functions as a specificity factor for primer recognition. In the absence of RF-C, DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) and PCNA form a complex at the primer-template junction, protecting exactly the same site as the primer recognition complex. Addition of RF-C to this complex produced a higher order complex which is unstable unless its formation is coupled with translocation of pol delta. These results suggest that the sequential binding of RF-C, PCNA, and pol delta to a primer-template junction might directly account for the initiation of leading strand DNA synthesis at a replication origin. We demonstrate this directly in an accompanying paper (Tsurimoto, T., and Stillman, B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 1961-1968)."

https://openalex.org/W1542006519,"The Ca2+ sensitivities of tonic (pulmonary and femoral artery) and phasic (portal vein and ileum) smooth muscles and the effects of guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) and norepinephrine on Ca2+ sensitivity of force development and myosin light chain (MLC20) phosphorylation were determined in permeabilized preparations that retained coupled receptors and endogenous calmodulin. The Ca2+ sensitivity of force was higher (approximately 3-fold) in the tonic than in the phasic smooth muscles. The nucleotide specificity of Ca2+ sensitization was: GTP gamma S much greater than GTP greater than ITP much greater than CTP = UTP. Baseline phosphorylation (7% at pCa greater than 8) and maximal phosphorylation (58% at pCa 5.0) were both lower in portal vein than in femoral artery (20 and 97%). Norepinephrine and GTP gamma S increased phosphorylation at constant [Ca2+] (pCa 7.0-6.5). MLC20 phosphorylation induced by norepinephrine was completely inhibited by guanosine 5'-O-(beta-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S). In portal vein at pCa 5, GTP gamma S increased phosphorylation from 58%, the maximal Ca2(+)-activated value, to 75%, and at pCa greater than 8, from 7 to 13%. In femoral artery at pCa 5, neither phosphorylation (97%) nor force was affected by GTP gamma S, while at pCa greater than 8, GTP gamma S caused an increase in force (16% of maximum) with a borderline increase in MLC20 phosphorylation (from 20 to 27%). MLC20 phosphorylation (up to 100%) was positively correlated with force. The major results support the hypothesis that the G-protein coupled Ca2(+)-sensitizing effect of agonists on force development is secondary to increased MLC20 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2028477896,"A combination of gene transfer and intracerebral grafting may provide a powerful technique for examining the role of discrete substances in the development or functioning of the brain. In the present study, primary fibroblasts obtained from a skin biopsy from inbred Fischer rats were used as donor cells for genetic modification and grafting. When grafted to the striatum of Fischer rats with a prior 6-hydroxydopamine lesion, primary fibroblasts containing a transgene for either tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or Î²-galactosidase survived for 10 weeks and continued to express the transgene. TH synthesized by the implanted fibroblasts appeared to convert tyrosine to l-dopa actively, as observed in vitro, and to affect the host brain, as assessed through a behavioral measurement. These results suggest that primary fibroblasts genetically altered to express TH have the capacity to deliver l-dopa locally to the striatum in quantities sufficient to compensate partially for the loss of intrinsic striatal dopaminergic input."
https://openalex.org/W1625430625,"Replication factors A and C (RF-A and RF-C) and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) differentially augment the activities of DNA polymerases alpha and delta. The mechanism of stimulation by these replication factors was investigated using a limiting concentration of primed, single-stranded template DNA. RF-A stimulated polymerase alpha activity in a concentration-dependent manner, but also suppressed nonspecific initiation of DNA synthesis by both polymerases alpha and delta. The primer recognition complex, RF-C.PCNA.ATP, stimulated pol delta activity in cooperation with RF-A, but also functioned to prevent abnormal initiation of DNA synthesis by polymerase alpha. Reconstitution of DNA replication with purified factors and a plasmid containing the SV40 origin sequences directly demonstrated DNA polymerase alpha dependent synthesis of lagging strands and DNA polymerase delta/PCNA/RF-C dependent synthesis of leading strands. RF-A and the primer recognition complex both affected the relative levels of leading and lagging strands. These results, in addition to results in an accompanying paper (Tsurimoto, T., and Stillman, B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 1950-1960), suggest that an exchange of DNA polymerase complexes occurs during initiation of bidirectional DNA replication at the SV40 origin."

https://openalex.org/W2031762818,"The Bicoid homeodomain protein controls anterior development in the Drosophila embryo by binding to DNA and regulating gene expression. With the use of genetic assays in yeast, the interaction between the Bicoid homeodomain and a series of mutated DNA sites was studied. These experiments defined important features of homeodomain binding sites, identified specific amino acid-base pair contacts, and suggested a model for interaction of the recognition alpha-helices of Bicoid and Antennapedia-class homeodomain proteins with DNA. The model is in general agreement with results of crystallographic and magnetic resonance studies, but differs in important details. It is likely that genetic studies of protein-DNA interaction will continue to complement conventional structural approaches."

https://openalex.org/W1489105628,"A sensitive and reproducible method to measure relative levels of polymerized and soluble tubulin in cells has been developed. This method involves metabolically labeling cells with radioactive amino acids followed by lysis in a microtubule-stabilizing buffer, centrifugation to separate soluble from polymerized tubulin, resolution of the proteins in each fraction by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and quantitation of the tubulin by liquid scintillation counting of spots excised from the gel. Several buffers were evaluated for their reproducibility and efficacy in preserving the state of in vivo microtubule assembly at the time of cell lysis, and the ability of the technique to measure drug-induced changes in tubulin polymerization was determined. Results using this method indicate that Chinese hamster ovary cells maintain approximately 40% of the cellular tubulin in an assembled form. Dose-dependent decreases in tubulin polymerization could be measured in Colcemid-treated cells, while dose-dependent increases in assembly were measured in taxol-treated cells. The results with taxol indicate that, following the increase in microtubule polymerization, there is a time-dependent bundling of microtubules that occurs without further increases in the extent of tubulin assembly. Examination of drug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells reveals that Colcemid-resistant mutants maintain more tubulin in the polymerized state (approximately 50%), while taxol-resistant mutants maintain less assembled tubulin (about 28%). Similar changes occur regardless of whether the mutant cells have an alteration in alpha- or in beta-tubulin. A model to explain these results is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1500070160,"Using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy, we have detected the expression of nine different homeobox genes in adult mouse intestine. Included among these are the recently described intestine-specific Cdx-1 gene and a new, related gene, Cdx-2. Southern blot experiments show that Cdx-2 is present in a single copy in the mouse genome. Of several adult mouse tissues assayed, intestine was the only one that contained detectable levels of Cdx-2 mRNA. Expression of all nine homeobox genes in different regions of the intestine was quantitated by RNase protection analysis, which revealed a unique expression profile for each gene. These observations suggest that homeobox gene expression may play an important role in cellular differentiation in the adult intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1491740602,"The human breast carcinoma cell line SK-BR-3, expresses the neu oncogene product, p185, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase. Using a double monoclonal antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for p185, activity was detected in conditioned media from cultures of SK-BR-3 cells. Two monoclonal antibodies specific for the extracellular domain of p185/neu immunoprecipitated a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 105 kDa. p105 was further shown to compete with p185 for binding to monoclonal antibodies and pulse-chase experiments indicate that it was generated by post-translational processing. Peptide maps showed that p105 and p185 are related polypeptides. Since p105 is close to the predicted size for the extracellular domain of p185/neu, we propose that SK-BR-3 cells specifically process and release this portion of the receptor into the medium. The release of the extracellular domain may have implications in oncogenesis and its detection could prove useful as a cancer diagnostic."
https://openalex.org/W98022268,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) binds to a transmembrane receptor having intrinsic guanylyl cyclase activity; this receptor has been designated GC-A. Binding of ANP to GC-A stimulates its catalytic activity, resulting in increased production of the second messenger, cyclic GMP. Here we show that GC-A can be expressed in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus and that the expressed protein retained its abilities to bind ANP and to function as an ANP-activated guanylyl cyclase. In addition, GC-A produced in insect cells was absolutely dependent on the presence of adenine nucleotides for activation by ANP. Millimolar concentrations of ATP were required for optimal activation. The relative potencies of various nucleotides for activation was adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) greater than ATP greater than ADP, adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate greater than ADP beta S. AMP had no effect. These studies suggest that binding of an adenine nucleotide, most likely to the protein kinase-like domain of GC-A, is absolutely required for ANP activation. Regulation of guanylyl cyclase activation by adenine nucleotides represents a novel mechanism for the modulation of signal transduction, possibly analogous in some respects to the role of guanine nucleotides and G proteins in the regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2113083939,"Tyrosine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the initial step in catecholamine biosynthesis, is phosphorylated at serines 8, 19, 31, and 40 in intact pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (Haycock, J.W. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11682-11691). After 32Pi labeling of rat corpus striata in vivo or rat corpus striatal synaptosomes, 32P incorporation into tyrosine hydroxylase occurred predominantly at serines 19, 31, and 40. Electrical stimulation (30 Hz, 20 min) of the medial forebrain bundle (containing the afferent dopaminergic fibers) increased 32P incorporation into each of the three sites. Brief depolarization of the synaptosomes with elevated [K+]o (20-60 mM, 5-30 s) or veratridine (50 microM, 2 min) produced a selective increase in 32P incorporation into Ser19. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (1 microM, 5 min) increased 32P incorporation into Ser31, and cAMP-acting agents such as forskolin (10 microM, 5 min) increased 32P incorporation into Ser40. In contrast, 32P incorporation into Ser8, which was usually detectable but very low, was not regulated either in vivo or in situ by any of the activators of signal transduction pathways. In synaptosomes, the only treatment found to increase Ser8 phosphorylation was okadaic acid (a protein phosphatase inhibitor), which increased 32P incorporation into all four phosphorylation sites. Thus, three different signal transduction systems appear to mediate the physiological regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation at three different sites."
https://openalex.org/W1588731696,"A total of 37 separate mutants containing single and multiple amino acid substitutions in the leader and amino-terminal conserved region of the Type IV pilin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The effect of these substitutions on the secretion, processing, and assembly of the pilin monomers into mature pili was examined. The majority of substitutions in the highly conserved amino-terminal region of the pilin monomer had no effect on piliation. Likewise, substitution of several of the residues within the six amino acid leader sequence did not affect secretion and leader cleavage (processing), including replacement of one or both of the positively charged lysine residues with uncharged or negatively charged amino acids. One characteristic of the Type IV pili is the presence of an amino-terminal phenylalanine after leader peptide cleavage which is N-methylated prior to assembly of pilin monomers into pili. Substitution of the amino-terminal phenylalanine with a number of other amino acids, including polar, hydrophobic, and charged residues, did not affect proper leader cleavage and subsequent assembly into pili. Amino-terminal sequencing showed that the majority of substitute residues were also methylated. Substitution of the glycine residue at the -1 position to the cleavage site resulted in the inability to cleave the prepilin monomers and blocked the subsequent assembly of monomers into pili. These results indicate that despite the high degree of conservation in the amino-terminal sequences of the Type IV pili, N-methylphenylalanine at the +1 position relative to the leader peptide cleavage site is not strictly required for pilin assembly. N-Methylation of the amino acids substituted for phenylalanine was shown to have taken place in four of the five mutants tested, but it remains unclear as to whether pilin assembly is dependent on this modification. Recognition and proper cleavage of the prepilin by the leader peptidase appears to be dependent only on the glycine residue at the -1 position. Cell fractionation experiments demonstrated that pilin isolated from mutants deficient in prepilin processing and/or assembly was found in both inner and outer membrane fractions, indistinguishable from the results seen with the wild type."

https://openalex.org/W1620132817,In the present study we have analyzed the involvement of phosphorylation in the function of P-glycoprotein and have also examined sites of phosphorylation along the P-glycoprotein polypeptide chain. The results show that in HL60 cells isolated for resistance to vincristine the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine induces a major inhibition in the phosphorylation of P-glycoprotein. Further studies show that under the same conditions in which staurosporine inhibits P-glycoprotein phosphorylation there is a concomitant increase in cellular drug accumulation and a major inhibition in drug efflux. Additional studies using pulse-chase experiments show that the P-glycoprotein phosphate groups are metabolically active and that the protein undergoes rapid cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in the cell. Structural analyses demonstrate that cleavage of 32P-labeled P-glycoprotein at Asp-Pro linkages with formic acid results in the formation of a major phosphorylated peptide of 35 kDa and a minor peptide of 42 kDa. Western blot analysis using site-specific anti-sera against P-glycoprotein suggests that P35 represents a phosphorylated fragment containing P-glycoprotein amino acids 446-744. Analysis of tryptic peptides using site-specific antisera identifies a second major phosphorylated region of P-glycoprotein which contains amino acids 745-1088. These studies thus suggest that phosphorylation plays an important role in the biological activity of P-glycoprotein. The results also indicate that two adjacent internal regions are highly phosphorylated in the P-glycoprotein molecule.
https://openalex.org/W1549162615,"In previous studies, initiation of protein synthesis was shown to be inhibited in perfused rat livers deprived of single essential amino acids. In the present study, histidinol, a competitive inhibitor of histidinyl-tRNA synthetase, was used to amplify the effects of histidine deprivation on protein synthesis in perfused liver to facilitate investigation of mechanisms involved in the inhibition of peptide chain initiation. Protein synthesis was reduced to 77% of the control rate in livers deprived of histidine and to 13% of the control rate in livers deprived of histidine and exposed to 2.0 mM histidinol. The inhibition of protein synthesis caused by histidine deprivation alone was accompanied by a 2-fold increase in the number of free ribosomal particles, a 29% decrease in Met-tRNA(i) binding to 43 S preinitiation complexes, and a 31% reduction in activity of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF-2B). By comparison, histidine deprivation combined with histidinol addition resulted in a 3-fold increase in free ribosomal particles, a 66% decrease in Met-tRNAi binding, and a 78% reduction in eIF-2B activity. The proportion of the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor two (eIF-2) in the phosphorylated form increased from 8.9 +/- 0.8% in control livers to 52.4 +/- 5.5% in response to histidinol. The increase in the amount of eIF-2 alpha in the phosphorylated form apparently was not due to an increase in kinase activity, because there was no change in eIF-2 alpha kinase activity in extracts of liver perfused with medium containing histidinol compared to controls. Instead, the increased phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha was associated with an inhibition of eIF-2 alpha phosphatase activity. Thus, in contrast to other systems that have been examined, the mechanism involved in the increase in the phosphorylation state of eIF-2 alpha appears to involve an inhibition of eIF-2 alpha phosphatase activity rather than activation of an eIF-2 alpha kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2095748353,"HTLV-I structural gene expression is posttranscriptionally regulated by the Rex protein and the Rex response element (RexRE), a 255 nucleotide RNA stem-loop structure located in the retroviral 3' LTR. Independent of Rex, the RexRE also plays a critical role in the polyadenylation of all HTLV-I transcripts. Folding of the RexRE serves to spatially juxtapose the widely separated AAUAAA hexamer and GU-rich elements that are essential for polyadenylation. In turn, this folding promotes the cooperative and stable binding of two nuclear factors at these elements that commits this poly(A) site to 3' processing. These findings highlight a novel mechanism of 3' end formation in the HTLV family of retroviruses and underscore the general requirement for protein-protein interactions in the polyadenylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1561692129,"Chicken cardiac C-protein was readily phosphorylated by purified calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II). Maximum incorporation was about 4 mol of 32P/mol of C-protein subunit. Peptide mapping indicated that some of the sites phosphorylated by CaM-kinase II were located on the same phosphopeptides obtained when C-protein was phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (peptides T1, T2, and T3). There was a fourth peptide (T3a) which was unique to CaM-kinase II phosphorylation. 32P-Amino acid analysis showed that essentially all of the 32P of peptides T1, T2, and T3a was in phosphoserine. cAMP-dependent protein kinase incorporated 32P only into threonine of peptide T3. Threonine was the preferred site of phosphorylation by CaM-kinase II, but there was significant phosphorylation of a serine in peptide T3. Partially purified C-protein preparations contained an associated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Peptide maps obtained from C-protein phosphorylated by the endogenous kinase were similar to those obtained from C-protein phosphorylated by CaM-kinase II. However, the ratio of phosphothreonine to phosphoserine in peptide T3 was lower. This was due to a contaminating phosphatase in the partially purified C-protein which preferentially dephosphorylated the phosphothreonine of peptide T3. It is suggested that the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase associated with C-protein is similar or identical to CaM-kinase II and that CaM-kinase II may play a role in the phosphorylation of C-protein in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1497188870,"Two novel chimeric pneumococcal cell wall lytic enzymes, named LC7 and CL7, have been constructed by in vitro recombination of the lytA gene encoding the major autolysin (LYTA amidase) of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a choline-dependent enzyme, and the cpl7 gene encoding the CPL7 lysozyme of phage Cp-7, a choline-independent enzyme. In remarkable contrast with previous chimeric constructions, we fused here two genes that lack nucleotide homology. The CL7 enzyme, which contains the N-terminal domain of CPL7 and C-terminal domain of LYTA, exhibited a choline-dependent lysozyme activity. This experimental rearrangement of domains might mimic the process that have generated the choline-dependent CPL1 lysozyme of phage Cp-1 during evolution, providing additional support to the modular theory of protein evolution. The LC7 enzyme, built up by fusion of the N-terminal domain of LYTA and the C-terminal domain of CPL7, exhibited an amidase activity capable of degrading ethanolamine-containing cell walls. The chimeric amidase behaved as an autolytic enzyme when it was cloned and expressed in S. pneumoniae. The chimeric enzymes provided new insights on the mechanisms involved in regulation of the host pneumococcal autolysins and on the participation of these enzymes in the process of cell separation. Furthermore, our experimental approach confirmed the basic role of the C-terminal domains in substrate recognition and revealed the influence of these domains on the optimal pH for catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1523044058,"We identified a splicing mutation in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, a heritable connective tissue disorder associated with dysfunctions of type III collagen. The mutation was first localized in the patient's type III procollagen mRNA by amplifying the reverse transcribed product in several overlapping fragments using the polymerase chain reaction. Amplified products spanning exon 24-26 sequences displayed two distinct fragments, one of normal size and the other lacking the 99 base pairs of exon 25. Sequencing of amplified genomic products identified a G to T transversion at position +5 of the splice donor site of intron 25 in one of the patient's procollagen III genes. Expression of allelic minigene constructs correlated the T for G substitution with skipping of exon 25 sequences. Like previously characterized splicing mutations in other collagen genes, lowering the temperature at which the patient's fibroblasts were incubated nearly abolished exon skipping. As a part of this study, we also identified a highly polymorphic, intronic DNA sequence whose different allelic forms can be detected easily by the polymerase chain reaction technique."

The synthetic opioid, D-Ala2,D-Leu5-enkephalin (DADLE), stimulated photolabeling of the 39-41-kDa proteins. In the presence of GDP, which increased the ratio of agonist-stimulated to basal photolabeling, DADLE at a maximally effective concentration stimulated photolabeling of the 39- and the 40-kDa protein 2-3-fold. Somatostatin, adrenaline, and bradykinin were less potent than DADLE and, to varying degrees, stimulated photolabeling of the 40-kDa protein more than that of the 39-kDa protein. Prostaglandin E1 was inactive. The present data represent direct evidence for an activation of endogenous Go and Gi2 via opioid receptors and other receptors in the native membrane milieu."
https://openalex.org/W1536945368,"Cross-linking of human fibrin by fibrin stabilizing factor (factor XIIIa) and tissue transglutaminase (ti-TG) was examined by immunoprobing electrophoregrams for positive identification of the cross-linked chains. The immunoprobing was carried out by a new, direct staining technique employing composite gels of a porous protein immobilizing matrix (glyoxyl agarose) blended with a removable polyacrylamide filler that eliminates need for Western blotting. We find that the known rapid cross-linking of gamma-chains into gamma 2-dyads by XIIIa is accompanied by co-cross-linking of the gamma 2-dyads with alpha-chains to form hybrid alpha gamma 2-triads. Little or no cross-linking of relatively abundant alpha- and gamma-chain monads into hybrid alpha gamma-dydads accompanies formation of the alpha gamma 2-triads. Thus, formation of the gamma 2-dyads accelerates the hybrid cross-linking. This acceleration is viewed as demonstrating a previously unknown mode of cooperative interaction between alpha- and gamma-chains arising from cross-linking of the D-domains of the molecules. This strengthened interaction is not critically dependent on fibrinopeptide-release, because alpha gamma 2-triads are similarly formed when fibrinogen is cross-linked by XIIIa. Also observed in the study with XIIIa was the formation of small amounts of homologous gamma 3 and gamma 4 oligomers which had been predicted by others to contribute to branching of fibrin strands. Unlike XIIIa, ti-TG acts preferentially on alpha-chains rather than gamma-chains as known. As alpha gamma-dyad, not seen in reactions with XIIIa, is produced concurrent with the homologous alpha-chain cross-linking. Also, three different species of alpha 2-dyads were produced by ti-TG, two of which were not seen in reactions with XIIIa. The differences in product formation revealed by the specific staining are viewed as providing criteria for distinguishing products of XIIIa and ti-TG in biologic specimens."
https://openalex.org/W1489337063,"The influence of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) on the replication of DNA containing the SV40 origin of replication has been examined. Extensive replication of SV40 DNA can be carried out in the presence of T antigen, topoisomerase I, the multimeric human single strand DNA-binding protein (HSSB), and DNA polymerase alpha-DNA primase (pol alpha-primase) complex (the monopolymerase system). In the monopolymerase system, both small products (Okazaki fragments), arising from lagging strand synthesis, and long products, arising from leading strand synthesis, are formed. The synthesis of long products requires the presence of relatively high levels of pol alpha-primase complex. In the presence of PARP, the synthesis of long products was blocked and only small Okazaki fragments accumulated, arising from the replication of the lagging strand template. The inhibition of leading strand synthesis by PARP can be effectively reversed by supplementing the monopolymerase system with the multimeric activator 1 protein (A1), the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and PCNA-dependent DNA polymerase delta (the dipolymerase system). The inhibition of leading strand synthesis in the monopolymerase system was caused by the binding of PARP to the ends of DNA chains, which blocked their further extension by pol alpha. The selective accumulation of Okazaki fragments was shown to be due to the coupled synthesis of primers by DNA primase and their immediate extension by pol alpha complexed to primase. PARP had little effect on this coupled reaction, but did inhibit the subsequent elongation of products, presumably after pol alpha dissociated from the 3'-end of the DNA fragments. PARP inhibited several other enzymatic reactions which required free ends of DNA chains. PARP inhibited exonuclease III, DNA ligase, the 5' to 3' exonuclease, and the elongation of primed DNA templates by pol alpha. In contrast, PARP only partly competed with the elongation of primed DNA templates by the pol delta elongation system which required SSB, A1, and PCNA. These results suggest that the binding of PARP at the ends of nascent DNA chains can be displaced by the binding of A1 and PCNA to primer ends. HSSB can be poly(ADP-ribosylated) in vivo as well as in vitro. However, the selective effect of PARP in blocking leading strand synthesis in the monopolymerase system was shown to depend primarily on its DNA binding property rather than on its ability to synthesize poly(ADP-ribose)."
https://openalex.org/W1485874288,"The overproduction of P-glycoprotein, an integral membrane protein thought to function as a drug efflux pump, is the hallmark of the multidrug resistance phenotype. In murine multidrug resistant J774.2 cell lines, distinct mdr genes, mdr1a and mdr1b, encode unique P-glycoprotein isoforms. To examine the transcriptional regulation of the mdr1b gene, its promoter was isolated and characterized. The transcription initiation site was mapped by primer extension, and the 5'-flanking region was sequenced. Several potential regulatory elements were identified in this region. A transient expression vector was constructed by fusion of 540 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence and part of the first untranslated exon to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. When transfected into monkey kidney COS-1, rat pituitary GH3 or T47D human breast cells, the mdr1b 5'-flanking sequences were capable of driving CAT expression. Transient transfection studies using deletion subclones of the mdr1b-CAT construct were done to locate potential cis-acting sequences. The studies indicate the presence of cis-acting elements in the 5'-flanking region of the mdr1b gene. The implications of these findings for expression and regulation of the mdr1b gene are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1513439921,"Guanylyl cyclase from bovine rod outer segments was solubilized using Triton X-100 and a high concentration of KCl, and its regulation was studied. The efficiency of solubilization was about 50-90% of total activity. When the Ca2+ content was lowered (less than 80 nM), guanylyl cyclase was activated about 2-fold. In the presence of higher concentrations of Ca2+ (greater than 140 nM), the activity was decreased. The regulation by Ca2+ was also demonstrated with solubilized preparations. In the presence of 186 nM Ca2+ which inhibited guanylyl cyclase, La3+ activated the enzyme about 2-fold, suggesting that the Ca2(+)-binding protein similar to other Ca2(+)-binding proteins associates with guanylyl cyclase regulation. Sodium nitroprusside and nitric oxide which are activators of soluble guanylyl cyclase in other tissues also activated the retinal guanylyl cyclase. Maximum activation by sodium nitroprusside was 20-fold using Mg2+ as a cofactor. Activation by nitric oxide and related compounds suggests that retinal guanylyl cyclase contains a heme prosthetic group that may participate in a novel regulatory mechanism for this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1567415408,"The multifunctional protein CAD catalyzes the first three steps in pyrimidine biosynthesis in mammalian cells, including the synthesis of carbamyl phosphate from bicarbonate, MgATP and glutamine. The Syrian hamster CAD glutaminase (GLNase) domain, a trpG-type amidotransferase, catalyzes glutamine hydrolysis in the absence of MgATP and bicarbonate (Km = 95 microM and kcat = 0.14 s-1). Unlike E. coli carbamyl phosphate synthetase (Wellner, V.P., Anderson, P.M., and Meister, A. (1973) Biochemistry 12, 2061-2066), a stable thioester intermediate did not accumulate when the mammalian enzyme was incubated with glutamine. However, a covalent adduct could be isolated when the protein was denatured in acid. The steady state concentration of the intermediate increased with increasing glutamine concentration to nearly one mole per mole of enzyme with half saturation at 105 microM, close to the Km value for glutamine. The adduct formed at the active site of the glutaminase domain. The rate of breakdown of the intermediate (k4), determined directly, was 0.17 s-1 and the rate of formation (k3) was estimated as 0.52 s-1. In the absence of MgATP and bicarbonate, k4 = kcat indicating that the decomposition of the intermediate is the rate-limiting step. The intermediate was chemically and kinetically competent, and the glutamine dissociation constant (330 microM) and rate constants were consistent with steady state kinetics and accurately predicted the steady state concentration of the intermediate. These studies suggest a mechanism similar to the cysteine proteases such as recently proposed by Mei and Zalkin (Mei, B., and Zalkin, H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16613-16619) who identified a catalytic triad in glutamine phosphoribosyl-5'-pyrophosphate amidotransferase, a purF-type enzyme. MgATP and bicarbonate increased kcat of the glutaminase reaction 14-fold by accelerating both the rate of formation and the rate of breakdown of the intermediate, and prevented the accumulation of the intermediate; however, the Km value for glutamine was not significantly altered. The instability of the thioester intermediate leads to appreciable hydrolysis of glutamine in the absence of the other substrates. However, bicarbonate alone spares glutamine by increasing the Km and Ks of glutamine to 600 and 8960 microM, respectively, thus reducing kcat/Km 3-fold when MgATP is limiting. In the absence of MgATP and bicarbonate, ammonia decreased the rate of hydrolysis and the accumulation of the thioester intermediate indicating that ammonia had direct access to the thioester at the GLNase domain active site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W79821297,"We have used isolated perfused rat livers to examine the intracellular processing of 125I-epidermal growth factor (EGF) and to determine where in the endocytic pathway the hydrolases which degrade EGF are acting. Following uptake of 125I-EGF at 37 or 16 degrees C, subcellular fractions enriched in endosomes and lysosomes were isolated, and their 125I-EGF content was examined by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Three forms of EGF processed at their carboxyl termini are generated in endosomes. At 37 degrees C, EGF is first processed in early endosomes by a carboxypeptidase B-like protease and is further processed in late endosomes by a trypsin-like protease and then a carboxypeptidase B-like protease. At 16 degrees C, entry of EGF into late endosomes is slowed, and only the first processed form is generated over 60 min. Longer perfusions (180 min) at 16 degrees C result in some processing (7%) by proteases found in late endosomes. EGF-horseradish peroxidase cytochemistry confirmed that the additional processing detected at 180 min correlated with movement of EGF from tubulovesicular to multivesicular endosomes. These results, combined with in vitro incubations of EGF in isolated endosomal and lysosomal fractions, suggest that different proteases are active at selective points in the endocytic pathway and that the full complement of proteases needed for complete degradation of EGF is active only in lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1603686834,"DNA replication from the SV40 origin can be reconstituted in vitro using purified SV40 large T antigen, cellular topoisomerases I and II, replication factor A (RF-A), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), replication factor C (RF-C), and a phosphocellulose fraction (IIA) made from human cell extracts (S100). Fraction IIA contains all DNA polymerase activity required for replication in vitro in addition to other factors. A newly identified factor has been purified from fraction IIA. This factor is required for complete reconstitution of SV40 DNA replication and co-purifies with a PCNA-stimulated DNA polymerase activity. This DNA polymerase activity is sensitive to aphidicolin, but is not inhibited by butylanilinodeoxyadenosine triphosphate or by monoclonal antibodies which block synthesis by DNA polymerase alpha. The polymerase activity is synergistically stimulated by the combination of RF-A, PCNA, and RF-C in an ATP-dependent manner. Purified calf thymus polymerase delta can fully replace the purified factor in DNA replication assays. We conclude that this factor, required for reconstitution of SV40 DNA replication in vitro, corresponds to human DNA polymerase delta."
https://openalex.org/W1570901238,"Proteolytic processing of somatostatin precursor produces several peptides including somatostatin-14 (S-14), somatostatin-28 (S-28), and somatostatin-28 (1-12) (S-28(1-12)). The subcellular sites at which these cleavages occur were identified by quantitative evaluation of these products in enriched fractions of the biosynthetic secretory apparatus of rat cortical or hypothalamic cells. Each of the major cellular compartments was obtained by discontinuous gradient centrifugation and was characterized both by specific enzyme markers and electron microscopy. The prosomatostatin-derived fragments were measured by radioimmunoassay after chromatographic separation. Two specific antibodies were used, allowing the identification of either S-28(1-12) or S-14 which results from peptide bond hydrolysis at a monobasic (arginine) and a dibasic (Arg-Lys) cleavage site, respectively. These antibodies also revealed prosomatostatin-derived forms containing at their COOH terminus the corresponding dodeca- and tetradecapeptide sequences. Whereas the reticulum-enriched fractions contained the highest levels of prosomatostatin, the proportion of precursor was significantly lower in the Golgi apparatus. In the latter fraction, other processed forms were also present, i.e. S-14 and S-28(1-12) together with the NH2-terminal domain (1-76) of prosomatostatin (pro-S(1-76). Inhibition of the intracellular transport either by monensin or by preincubation at reduced temperature resulted in an increase of prosomatostatin-derived peptides in the Golgi-enriched fractions. Finally, immunogold labeling using antibodies raised against S-28(1-12) and S-14 epitopes revealed the presence of these forms almost exclusively in the Golgi-enriched fraction mainly at the surface of saccules and vesicles. Together these data demonstrate that in rat neural cells, prosomatostatin proteolytic processing at both monobasic and dibasic sites is initiated at the level of the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1598900371,"Treatment of Escherichia coli dihydroorotase (a homodimer of subunit molecular weight 38,729) containing only the 1 active site Zn(II) ion per subunit with the sulfhydryl reagent N-(ethyl)-maleimide (NEM) blocks the two external Zn(II) sites per subunit and dramatically lessens the precipitation caused by high concentrations of Zn(II); stabilizes the enzyme partially against air oxidation and dilution inactivation; makes the active site Zn(II) easier to remove; and lowers Km and increases kcat. Treatment of NEM-blocked dihydroorotase ((NEM)dihydroorotase) with the chelator 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid at pH 5.0 in the absence of oxygen and trace metal ions removes the active site Zn(II) with a half-life of 15 min, allowing the production of milligram amounts of moderately stable apo-(NEM)dihydroorotase in about 80% yield. Treatment of apo-(NEM)dihydroorotase with Co(II) at pH 7.0 produces (NEM)dihydroorotase completely substituted at the active site with Co(II) in 100% yield: analysis gives 0.95-1.1 g atoms of Co(II) per active site and 0.03-0.05 g atoms of Zn(II) per active site. This Co(II)-(NEM)dihydroorotase is hyperactive at pH 8. The electronic absorption spectrum of Co(II)-(NEM)dihydroorotase at pH 6.5 implicates an active site thiol group as a ligand to the metal ion. The spectrum is inconsistent with tetrahedral coordination of the active site metal ion and is most consistent with a pentacoordinate structure."
https://openalex.org/W2400404181,"We used perfused rat livers to investigate the role of endosomes versus lysosomes in the hydrolysis of endocytosed material. When perfusions were performed at 37 degrees C with 125I-asialoorosomucoid, 125I-galactosylated albumin, or 125I-mannosylated albumin, there was a 15-min lag before trichloroacetic acid-soluble degradation products were detected. Furthermore, no hydrolysis was detected at 16 degrees C, indicating that there was no significant prelysosomal degradation of these proteins. Since detection by this method depends on extensive hydrolysis, we subsequently used three small synthetic molecules from which fluorescent products are generated by a single cleavage. These were 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, and 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucosaminide, which are substrates for aryl sulfatase, acid phosphatase, and beta-hexosaminidase, respectively. Using the first two compounds, hydrolysis was detected after 3 min at 37 degrees C and still occurred, albeit to a reduced extent, at 16 and 4 degrees C. This indicates that aryl sulfatase and acid phosphatase are active prelysosomally. We found a different result with 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucosaminide. At 37 degrees C, there was a greater than 15-min lag before hydrolysis products were measured; furthermore, hydrolysis ceased at 16 degrees C, indicating that beta-hexosaminidase is active lysosomally. Taken together, these findings show that there is selective activation and/or delivery of hydrolases along the endocytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1642891762,"CAD is a 243-kDa multidomain polypeptide which catalyzes the first three steps in mammalian de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. The largest cDNA clone obtained thus far, pCAD142 (Shigesada, K., Stark, G.R., Maley, J. A., Niswander, L. A., and Davidson, J. N. (1985) Mol. Cell. Biol. 5, 1735), lacks the 5' end of the mRNA which encodes the amino terminus of CAD. To clone this missing segment, a synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to pCAD142 and poly(A)+ RNA template, isolated from a Syrian hamster cell line which overproduces the CAD mRNA, were used for cDNA synthesis. The resulting clone pKB11, which has a 1369-base pair (bp) cDNA insert, overlapping pCAD142 by 781 bp, was identified by hybridization methods and sequence analysis and found to contain the entire cDNA sequence for the amino end of the CAD polypeptide. The deduced amino acid sequence is homologous to seven carbamyl phosphate synthetases. Primer extension, oligonucleotide-directed RNase H digestion, and RNA sequencing indicated that pKB11 extends to within 68 bases of the 5' end of the CAD mRNA. This conclusion was confirmed by Northern blotting analysis of the 5'-flanking region of CAD gene. The probable 3' end of an unidentified gene which codes for a 1-kilobase (kb) transcript was identified immediately upstream of the CAD gene. Northern analysis using probes complementary to the region between the CAD and the 1-kb genes detected the presence of a small transcript of less than 300 nucleotides. The sequence revealed three potential translation initiation sites raising the possibility of more than one CAD translation product. The major translation start codon was identified as the first ATG in pKB11 by sequence homology, in vitro transcription and translation, and protein studies. Starting from this ATG within pKB11, the clone encodes a 143-residue domain of unknown function. This study completes the determination of the primary structure of the CAD polypeptide. The CAD mRNA is 7.5 kb in length and has 6675 bp of coding sequence and about 200 bp and 600 bp of untranslated sequence at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1574224913,"The transferrin cycle was used to attempt the import of bioactive macromolecules into cells with the aid of an acid-labile cross-linking agent. Anti-tetanus F(ab')2 fragments were iodinated and then conjugated to transferrin with a newly developed acid-labile cleavable cross-linking reagent, bismaleimidoethoxy propane, following thiolation of both proteins. Noncleavable conjugates were also prepared. At saturating conjugate concentrations, the uptake rate for both conjugates averaged over the first 2 h is about 6.5 fmol/million cells/min. Incubation of loaded cells in fresh medium for 30 min and analysis of cell pellets and supernatants reveal that 1) of the previously cell-associated label, only intact conjugate (about 50% of the label) is returned to the medium; 2) most of the remaining cell-associated material for the cleavable conjugate is chromatographically coincident with free Fab with some contribution from free F(ab')2 fragments. In contrast, the cell pellets loaded with noncleavable conjugates contained intact transferrin-F(ab'), conjugates. These results are consistent with transferrin receptor-mediated uptake of acid-labile conjugate followed by hydrolysis in acidified endosomes and resulting in concentration of free F(ab')2 and Fab within a prelysosomal intracellular compartment. A protein shuttle such as transferrin may therefore be used with ketal based acid-labile cross-linkers to load foreign molecules into an intracellular compartment. In addition, these data provide independent confirmation of the low pH compartment within the transferrin cycle. This new methodology is applicable to other cases of receptor/ligand trafficking to report low pH compartments independent of morphological analysis. Since transferrin receptors are overexpressed in tumors, antineoplastic agents could be targeted to tumors as transferrin acid-labile conjugates. This import system might be particularly useful in combatting the tumor cell export of antitumor agents occurring in multidrug resistance."

https://openalex.org/W1493682862,"Several types of extracellular signals affect the function of peripheral neurons. Depolarizing stimuli cause sudden increases in permeability to various ions leading to propagation of nerve impulses and release of transmitter substances. Neurons also receive external signals via neurotransmitter receptors located on the membrane. Different types of receptors present on sympathetic neurons are believed to modulate stimulation-evoked release of norepinephrine. We have investigated the effects of depolarizing stimuli and neurotransmitters on different signaling pathways in homogeneous cultures of chick sympathetic neurons. Depolarizing stimuli (35 mM KCl; electrical stimulation, 1 Hz for 5 min) and neurotransmitters (acetylcholine and 5-hydroxytrypatmine) enhanced membrane binding of protein kinase C by 2-5-fold. 35 mM KCl increased formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol and hydrolysis of [3H]phosphatidycholine without affecting [3H] phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Neurotransmitters increased [3H]inositol phosphates and 1,2-diacylglycerol without affecting the hydrolysis of [3H]phosphatidylcholine. 5-Hydroxytryptamine and acetylcholine (muscarinic component) did not increase Ca2+ concentration in the Indo-1-loaded neuronal cell body or the growth cone, but 35 mM KCl and electrical stimulation caused a marked increase in Ca2+ concentration in both regions of sympathetic neurons. We believe this to be the first demonstration of these two types of signalling mechanisms co-existing in sympathetic neurons; depolarization activate the phosphatidylcholine pathway and neurotransmitters activate the phosphatidylinositol pathway. The importance of two pathways in controlling neuronal Ca2+ concentration and the release of transmitter is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1555155070,"The expression of the intestinal peptide-proton cotransporter was examined in Xenopus laevis oocytes by microinjection of poly(A)+ mRNA prepared from rabbit intestinal mucosal cells. The concomitant expression of the glucose-sodium co-transporter was used as the control for the effectiveness of the expression technique. There was significant endogenous activity of Gly-Sar uptake in water-injected oocytes, but the uptake activity increased nearly 3-fold in poly(A)+ mRNA-injected oocytes. The expression of the peptide transporter was time-dependent. There was no detectable expression on day 1 after injection. The expression became noticeable on day 2 and increased with time, reaching a maximum on day 4. There was no further change on days 5 and 6. The endogenous uptake rate measured in water-injected oocytes, on the contrary, showed a slight decrease during this time. The expressed peptide transporter retained its substrate specificity, having affinity for the dipeptides, Gly-Sar and Gly-Pro, and no or little affinity for the free amino acids, Gly and Sar. The expressed peptide transporter also showed a dependence on a transmembrane H+ gradient for maximal activity. These data demonstrate that the mammalian intestinal peptide-proton co-transporter can be successfully expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This expression system can provide an effective assay procedure to clone the gene encoding the transporter."

The liver was then quickly perfused in situ, and the cytoplasmic contents of the periportal and perivenous hepatocytes were selectively sampled by modification of the dual-digitonin-pulse technique (Quistorff, B., and Grunnet, N. (1987) Biochem. J. 243, 87-95). The 13C isotopic enrichment at each carbon position of the glucosyl units of hepatic glycogen was determined by 13C NMR and that of the C-1 position by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. From comparison of hepatic glycogen repleted by direct incorporation of plasma glucose (glucose----glucose-6-P----glucose-1-P----UDP-glucose----glycogen) was calculated to be 29% in the periportal zone and 35% in the perivenous zone, assuming equal glycogen synthetic rates within the two zones. Thus, the majority of glycogen is derived by an indirect route (glucose--------3-carbon unit--------glucose --------UDP-glucose--------glycogen) in both the periportal zone and in the perivenous zone. In conclusion, in a 24-h fasted rat there does not appear to be a major difference between the periportal and perivenous hepatocytes in the percent of glycogen synthesized by the direct pathway following a glucose load."

(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9827-9835). Three mutant enzymes have now been engineered, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified: the single mutants C283I and E284Q and the double mutant C283I:E284Q. The wild-type and mutant enzymes have similar specific activities and Km values for alpha-ketoglutarate, ammonium ion, and NADPH, indicating that neither cysteine 283 nor glutamic acid 284 is essential for activity. The mutant enzyme E284Q, like wild-type glutamate dehydrogenase, is substantially inactivated by 2-BDB-T epsilon A 2',5'-DP. In contrast, the two cysteine mutant enzymes, C283I and C283I:E284Q, are not inactivated by 2-BDB-T epsilon A 2',5'-DP. Modified tryptic peptides with the sequence Leu-X-Glu(Gln)-Ile-Lys were isolated from wild-type or E284Q enzymes inactivated by 2-BDB-T epsilon A 2',5'-DP. This peptide was absent from digests of active wild-type enzyme modified in the presence of the protectant NADPH and from digests of active C283I enzyme after incubation with 2-BDB-T epsilon A 2',5'-DP. Although it is not required for catalytic activity, cysteine 283 is implicated by the results of the affinity labeling experiments as the reaction target of the nucleotide analogue and is located in the region of the coenzyme binding site."
