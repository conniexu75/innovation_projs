https://openalex.org/W2142120946,"We investigated the mechanism of lysosome-mediated cell death using purified recombinant pro-apoptotic proteins, and cell-free extracts from the human neuronal progenitor cell line NT2. Potential effectors were either isolated lysosomes or purified lysosomal proteases. Purified lysosomal cathepsins B, H, K, L, S, and X or an extract of mouse lysosomes did not directly activate either recombinant caspase zymogens or caspase zymogens present in an NT2 cytosolic extract to any significant extent. In contrast, a cathepsin L-related protease from the protozoan parasiteTrypanosoma cruzi, cruzipain, showed a measurable caspase activation rate. This demonstrated that members of the papain family can directly activate caspases but that mammalian lysosomal members of this family may have been negatively selected for caspase activation to prevent inappropriate induction of apoptosis. Given the lack of evidence for a direct role in caspase activation by lysosomal proteases, we hypothesized that an indirect mode of caspase activation may involve the Bcl-2 family member Bid. In support of this, Bid was cleaved in the presence of lysosomal extracts, at a site six residues downstream from that seen for pathways involving capase 8. Incubation of mitochondria with Bid that had been cleaved by lysosomal extracts resulted in cytochrome c release. Thus, cleavage of Bid may represent a mechanism by which proteases that have leaked from the lysosomes can precipitate cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase activation. This is supported by the finding that cytosolic extracts from mice ablated in the bid gene are impaired in the ability to release cytochrome c in response to lysosome extracts. Together these data suggest that Bid represents a sensor that allows cells to initiate apoptosis in response to widespread adventitious proteolysis.

Each of these pathways converges to a common execution phase of apoptosis that requires the activation of caspases 3 and 7 from their inactive zymogen form to their processed, active form (1Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 2Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6181) Google Scholar). The apical activators, caspase 8 and 9, and granzyme B all have a primary specificity for cleavage at Asp297 (caspase 1 numbering convention), located in a region that delineates the large and small subunits of active caspases 3 and 7. The activation of the cell death pathway depends on both the triggering stimulus and the cell type (3Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar), and in many forms of apoptosis cytochrome c release from mitochondria is important for activation of downstream caspases (4Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 protein family contains both pro- and anti-apoptotic members that can act as an upstream checkpoint of caspase activation at the level of the mitochondria by controlling cytochrome c release. Bid, a pro-apoptotic member of the family, has recently been identified as a target for proteolytic cleavage by caspase 8 and granzyme B (5Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C.

Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Activated caspase 8 cleaves Bid at Asp59 to trigger translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria where it promotes cytochrome c release. Direct cleavage of both Bid and the downstream caspases can promote death pathways; however, it is unclear to what degree specificity of cleavage is required. For example, whereas processing of the caspase 3 and 7 zymogens at Asp297 is considered to be the dominant physiologic pathway for activation, cleavage of pro-caspase 7 at Gln295 is sufficient to activate the zymogen in vitro (9Zhou Q. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Such results suggest that alternative proteolytic events may be sufficient to activate pro-caspases and perhaps Bid cleavage, especially in pathologic instances where proteolysis tends to be unregulated. The lysosome is the primary reservoir of nonspecific proteases in the mammalian cell. In certain pathological situations, as well as during normal aging (10Bi X. Yong A.P. Zhou J. Gall C.M. Lynch G. Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11Nakamura Y. Takeda M. Suzuki H. Morita H. Tada K. Hariguchi S. Nishimura T. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 97: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), lysosomal integrity may be compromised, causing leakage of lysosomal proteases into the cytosol. Thus, certain diseases related to lysosomal pathology may have a primarily apoptotic component. Several lines of evidence support this possibility: (i) leakage of lysosomal proteases into the cytosolic compartment may be involved in the activation of caspases (12Ishisaka R. Utsumi T. Yabuki M. Kanno T. Furuno T. Inoue M. Utsumi K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar); (ii) in Jurkat T-cells, α-tocopheryl succinate triggers apoptosis and caspase 3 activation accompanied by lysosomal destabilization (13Neuzil J. Svensson I. Weber T. Weber C. Brunk U.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); and (iii) the lysosomal protease cathepsin B has been implicated in the activation of the proinflammatory caspases 11 (14) and 1 (15Vancompernolle K. Van Herreweghe F. Pynaert G. Van de Craen M. De Vos K. Totty N. Sterling A. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) as well as in the induction of the nuclear morphology associated with apoptotic cells (15Vancompernolle K. Van Herreweghe F. Pynaert G. Van de Craen M. De Vos K. Totty N. Sterling A. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The role of lysosomal proteases in the activation of the apoptotic pathway is unclear. To examine the possibility that they may be involved in programmed cell death, the activity of both recombinant cathepsins and lysosomal extracts on recombinant caspases and cytosolic extracts was examined. We tested two hypotheses: that lysosomal proteases may directly activate executioner caspases and that lysosomal protease cleavage of Bid may separately trigger the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.

Active caspases 3, 6, 7, 8, and 10 and zymogens of caspases 3 and 7 were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described (30Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods. 1999; 17: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recombinant mouse Bid was purified as described previously, except that all detergents were omitted from the preparation procedure (31Schendel S.L. Azimov R. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Kagan B.L.

Anti-human caspase 2 and monoclonal cytochromec antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Pharmingen, respectively. The chromogenic caspase substrate acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-p-nitroanilide (Ac-DEVD-pNA)1 was purchased from BIOMOL, while the fluorogenic substrates benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Z-FR-AMC), acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluorometylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AFC) were obtained from Bachem and Enzyme Systems Products, respectively. The inhibitors E-64 and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) were from Peptide Research Institute and Enzyme Systems Products, respectively. Stock solutions of the substrates and inhibitors were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −20 °C for up to 12 months. Because the purity of lysosomes and mitochondria was paramount in this study, we analyzed all purifications with one mitochondrial and two lysosomal markers to minimize any cross-contamination between these organelles. For lysosomes we followed the activity of lysosomal proteases on Z-FR-AMC substrate (35Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar) and β-hexoaminidase using a method modified from (36Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). For mitochondria, we used succinicp-iodonitrotetrazolium reductase (37Mehta D.P. Ichikawa M. Salimath P.V. Etchison J.R. Haak R. Manzi A. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10897-10903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Test samples during the purifications were treated with Triton X-100 (final concentration, 1% w/v) and spun at 9,800 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was assayed. The enzyme assays were carried out at 37 °C. Controls in the absence of the sample were run under the same conditions. A 5-μl sample of each fraction was added to a 96-well plate. The reaction started by addition of 95 μl of prewarmed 10 μm Z-FR-AMC in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 1 mm DTT and 250 mm sucrose. The released product was measured continuously during 5 min at 37 °C using a fmax fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices), at excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 460 nm, respectively. For β-hexoaminidase assays, a 25-μl sample was added to a 96-well plate. The reaction was started by addition of 75 μl of 2 mm4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside in 400 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.4, containing 250 mm sucrose. The released product was measured continuously during 20 min at 37 °C using the fmax fluorescence microplate reader, at excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 460 nm, respectively. A 25-μl sample of succinicp-iodonitrotetrazolium reductase was incubated with 75 μl of 2 mm p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet in 55 mm potassium dihydrogen phosphate and 55 mmsuccinic acid, pH 6.0, containing 250 mm sucrose until a pink color caused by product formation developed. The reaction was stopped by adding 125 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of ethanol. The sample was clarified at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and the absorbance of the supernatant was read at 495 nm on a SpectraMAX 340 spectrophotometric plate reader (Molecular Devices). Lysosomes were purified from mouse liver as described previously with several modifications (36Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar,38Koenig H. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 457-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. Briefly, several livers were washed with sucrose/Pipes buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Pipes, pH 7.2), resuspended in 10 volumes sucrose/Pipes buffer and homogenized by two brief pulses from a Brinkman Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 540 × g to remove nuclei and particulates. CaCl2 (final concentration, 1 mm) was added to the supernatant, followed by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C to disrupt the mitochondria. The supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000 × g, and the heavy membrane pellet was retained. At this point, the integrity of the lysosomes was verified by comparing the activity of the supernatant and the pellet, with the lysosomal protease substrate Z-FR-AMC in the presence and absence of a lysosomotropic detergent (Triton X-100; final concentration, 1% w/v). If the lysosomes were judged at least 80% intact, the heavy membrane fraction was resuspended in sucrose/Pipes buffer, centrifuged again for 10 min at 18,000 × g, and resuspended in Percoll (40% w/v) in sucrose/Pipes. The Percoll solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 44,000 × g to form a gradient, and 1-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and assayed for mitochondrial contamination using the lysosomal and mitochondrial enzyme markers as described above. The lysosomal fractions were pooled, diluted in sucrose/Pipes (1:10 v/v) to decrease the Percoll, and pelleted by centrifugation at 17,000 ×g for 10 min. The lysosomal pellet was washed, resuspended in an equal volume of sucrose/Pipes, and stored at −70 °C. Soluble lysosomal constituents were released by three freeze-thaw cycles with a 15-s vortex between each cycle. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the lysosomal membranes, and the supernatant was saved. Mitochondria were isolated from rat heart according to the procedure described in Ref. 39Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar. Protein content was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and the mitochondria were stored on ice at 3 mg/ml mitochondrial protein. The mitochondria were used within 2 h of preparation. A cytosolic extract from the human neuronal cell line NT2/D1 was prepared as described previously (40Ellerby H.M. Martin S.J. Ellerby L.M. Naiem S.S. Rabizadeh S. Salvesen G.S. Casiano C.A. Cashman N.R. Green D.R. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6165-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and the extract was diluted to 10 mg/ml by the addition of potential caspase activators (cytochrome c or proteases). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8–18% gradient acrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and probed with antibodies against human caspases. Caspase-antibody complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The activation of caspase zymogens, whether recombinant or in NT2 cytosolic extracts, was followed fluorometrically by monitoring AFC release from the substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC. A 5-μl aliquot of NT2 cytosolic extract (14 mg/ml) or zymogens of caspases 3 and 7 (70 nm) were incubated in assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 10% (w/v) sucrose, and 10 mm DTT, pH 7.4) with potential proteolytic activators in the range of 1 nmto 1 μm at 37 °C for 30 min, (total volume, 50 μl). For analysis of potential activators in the lysosomal extract, 2–5 μl of extract was used in place of the purified proteases. Activation was analyzed by adding 50 μl of the substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC (200 μm) in 96-well microplate format to a 37 °C thermojacketed fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices), and caspase activity was determined at excitation and emission wavelengths of 405 and 510 nm, respectively. The reaction was followed continuously for 30 min. The steady-state hydrolysis rates were obtained from the linear part of the curves. The instantaneous rates of cruzipain-mediated activation for caspase zymogens 3 and 7 were determined as described previously (9Zhou Q. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, caspase zymogen 3 (final concentration, 92.3 nm) or caspase zymogen 7 (final concentration, 20 nm) were added to the substrate, the reaction was started by cruzipain addition to final concentrations of 50, 200, or 300 nm, and the time course was followed continuously for 30 min. In separate experiments to characterize the NT2 cytosolic extracts, granzyme B (final concentration, 20 nm) or cytochrome c/dATP (final concentration, 10 μm/1 mm) was added to 40 μl of extract in the presence of Ac-DEVD-pNA (final concentration, 100 μm). Although the NT2 extracts usually activated equally well in the presence or absence of dATP, we kept this in as a standard procedure (41Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar), although subsequent descriptions may refer to cytochrome c alone. The release ofp-nitroanilide was continuously recorded during 30 min at 405 nm in 96-well microplate format using a SpectraMAX 340 spectrophotometric plate reader (Molecular Devices) thermojacketed at 37 °C. The active concentration of each of the purified lysosomal proteases was standardized by using E-64 (42Salvesen G. Nagase H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 83-104Google Scholar), and the active concentration of caspases was standardized by a similar protocol utilizing Z-VAD-fmk (30Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods. 1999; 17: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The endogenous anti-lysosomal protease concentration in NT2 cytosolic extracts was determined by titration using standardized proteases where 5 μl of each enzyme (0.1–2 nm (final concentration) dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm DTT, pH 6.0) was incubated with increasing concentrations of NT2 cytosolic extract (0–100 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The residual activity in the presence of 10 μm of the lysosomal protease substrate Z-FR-AMC was measured continuously in a thermojacketed fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 460 nm, respectively. The effects of the cystatins were studied using human stefins A and B (final concentration, 1 μm), cystatins C, D, E, and F (final concentration, 300 nm) and low molecular weight kininogen (2.9 μm) were incubated with caspases 3, 6, 7, and 8 (final concentration, 0.02–10 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the residual activity on Ac-DEVD-AFC (final concentration, 100 μm) was measured as above with excitation and emission wavelengths of 405 and 510 nm, respectively. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane. The membranes were stained with Coomassie Blue for 2 min, destained, and washed extensively with distilled water. The appropriate bands were excised and sequenced on a 476A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). An aliquot of rat mitochondria equal to 10 μg of protein (or 15 μg of protein for mouse mitochondria) incubated in the presence or absence of a 2.5-μl aliquot of Bid at a final concentration of either 1 or 10 nm. Lysosomes at 1 mg/ml protein concentration were added at the indicated volumes. The volume was supplemented to a final volume of 25 μl with cMRM medium (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm sodium succinate, 0.08 mm ADP, 2 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.5). The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 40 min with gentle shaking. The mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl with 5 μl of SDS sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. 5 μl of sample buffer was added to the supernatant fractions. The samples were resolved on a 15% Hi-Tris gel (43Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleichler & Schuell) and probed with anti-cytochrome c antibody. Antibody complexes were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Several exposures were taken for each blot. Total cytochrome c content is represented by mitochondrial samples treated with 1% Triton X-100. The procedure is essentially conducted as described previously (5Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C.

The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove intact cells and nuclei, and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to precipitate the heavy membrane fractions (mitochondria). The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in the same buffer. Mitochondria were kept on ice and used within 2 h of preparation. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for another 60 min to obtain the cytosolic extracts used in the assay. The human NT2/D1 teratocarcinoma cell line, a neuronal progenitor, was chosen for generating cytosolic extracts because it responds well to a variety of apoptotic stimuli (40Ellerby H.M. Martin S.J. Ellerby L.M. Naiem S.S. Rabizadeh S. Salvesen G.S. Casiano C.A. Cashman N.R. Green D.R. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6165-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Gervais F.G. Xu D.

Caspases 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, the human caspases currently considered to participate in apoptosis signaling, are present in the cytosolic extract (Fig.1 A). We were able to determine some of the caspase concentrations in the cytosolic extract by semi-quantitative Western blot analysis, where standard recombinant caspases were compared with the endogenous NT2 amounts (for results see Fig. 1 A). These concentrations, although probably lower than the endogenous cytosolic concentration, support rapid caspase activation following addition of activators in vitro. Caspase activation in extracts was followed after the addition of cytochrome c, which resulted in processing of pro-caspases 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9 to their presumptive active forms, whereas the upstream caspases 8 and 10 were not processed under the same conditions (Fig. 1 A). The lack of pro-caspase 8 or 10 processing is in contrast to previous results with Jurkat T-cell extracts (45Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C.

We offer no explanation for the processing of pro-caspase 2, because its function in apoptotic pathways is still debated (46Bergeron L. Perez G.I. Macdonald G. Shi L. Sun Y. Jurisicova A. Varmuza S.

Activation was also followed by observing the increase in activity against the substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA (Fig.1 B), which predominantly reflects activation of pro-caspase 3, although other caspases will also contribute to the increase in activity (48Stenn"
https://openalex.org/W2021693846,"The oncoproteins of small DNA tumor viruses promote tumorigenesis by complexing with cellular factors intimately involved in the control of cell proliferation. The major oncogenic determinants for human adenovirus type 9 (Ad9) and high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the E4-ORF1 and E6 proteins, respectively. These seemingly unrelated viral oncoproteins are similar in that their transforming activities in cells depend, in part, on a carboxyl-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif which mediates interactions with the cellular PDZ-protein DLG. Here we demonstrated that both Ad9 E4-ORF1 and high-risk HPV E6 proteins also bind to the DLG-related PDZ-protein MAGI-1. These interactions resulted in MAGI-1 being aberrantly sequestered in the cytoplasm by the Ad9 E4-ORF1 protein or being targeted for degradation by high-risk HPV E6 proteins. Transformation-defective mutant viral proteins, however, were deficient for these activities. Our findings indicate that MAGI-1 is a member of a select group of cellular PDZ proteins targeted by both adenovirus E4-ORF1 and high-risk HPV E6 proteins and, in addition, suggest that the tumorigenic potentials of these viral oncoproteins depend, in part, on an ability to inhibit the function of MAGI-1 in cells."

In addition to a caspase-3-mediated cleavage releasing the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin, a metalloproteinase sheds the extracellular domain from the cell surface during apoptosis. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that concomitant with the disappearance of E-cadherin staining at the cell surface, the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain accumulates in the cytosol. In the presence of inhibitors of caspase-3 and/or metalloproteinases, cleavage of E-cadherin was almost completely blocked.

Malfunctions of the death program and its control mechanisms often result in prenatal death during development and contribute to immune and neuronal diseases or cancer in the adult organism (2Jacobson M.D. Weil M.

The central mechanism of this cell death machinery is a proteolytic cascade mediated by the caspase family of cysteine proteinases (5Cohen G.M. Biochem.

After initiation of the apoptotic program these proenzymes are processed by two proteolytic events, generating a large subunit and a small subunit that form a heterodimer. The association of two heterodimers results in the formation of the active enzyme containing two catalytic sites (7Walker N.P. Talanian R.V. Brady K.D. Dang L.C. Bump N.J. Ferenz C.R. Franklin S.

Depending on their position in the proteolytic cascade, caspase family members are divided into upstream initiator caspases and downstream effector caspases. The activation of this caspase cascade leads to the specific cleavage of substrate proteins and finally results in the morphological changes becoming apparent in apoptotic cells. The identification of an increasing number of caspase substrates has revealed different classes of cellular proteins that are cleaved during the effector phase of apoptosis. A set of substrate proteins is represented by proteins that protect living cells from apoptosis, e.g. ICAD/DFF45 (9Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Morphological changes observed during apoptosis in part result from effects on cell-cell contacts. The cadherin-catenin adhesion complex represents one of the major adhesive systems in multiple epithelial tissues. Cadherins comprise a large family of Ca2+-dependent, homophilic cell-cell adhesion molecules essential for morphogenic movements and tissue formation during development and for maintenance of tissue integrity in the adult organism (29Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar, 30Huber O. Bierkamp C. Kemler R. Curr. Opin.

Mutations in E-cadherin were identified in a number of carcinomas and highly invasive tumor-derived cell lines (32Nollet F. Berx G. van Roy F. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). For their functional integrity, cadherin extracellular domains have to form lateral dimers, and the cytoplasmic domain has to be connected to the actin cytoskeleton by the catenins (33Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Within the cadherin-catenin complex, β-catenin or plakoglobin is directly associated with the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins, and α-catenin establishes the connection to the actin microfilament system (34Aberle H. Schwartz H. Kemler R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Recently β-catenin and γ-catenin/plakoglobin were reported to be proteolytically targeted by caspases during the apoptotic effector phase, whereas α-catenin was not affected (35Brancolini C. Lazarevic D. Rodriguez J. Schneider C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 36Brancolini C. Sgorbissa A. Schneider C.

Here we present a detailed analysis of the apoptotic fate of E-cadherin in epithelial cells. Induction of apoptosis resulted in the formation of three detectable E-cadherin cleavage products with apparent molecular masses of 24, 29, and 84 kDa, respectively, that were generated by two distinct proteolytic activities. One of these activities could be blocked by the caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK,1 whereas the other proteolytic event, shedding the E-cadherin extracellular domain into the cell culture medium, was mediated by a metalloprotease. According to these data both proteases are required for the efficient cleavage of E-cadherin during apoptosis. MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in the presence of 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 5% CO2.

Porter) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The monoclonal antibody directed against the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain (clone 36) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); antibody HECD-1 against the human E-cadherin extracellular domain was obtained from R & D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany); and DECMA-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Rolf Kemler (Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology, Freiburg, Germany). Horseradi peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Alexa FluorTM 488 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa FluorTM 594 phalloidin were obtained from Molecular Probes (MoBiTec, Gottingen, Germany). Caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK and MMP inhibitor I were purchased from Calbiochem; TAPI (N−{Δ,l[2-(hydroxyaminocarbonyl)methyl]-4-methylpentanoyl}l-3-(2′naphthyl)-alanyl-l-alanine, 2-aminoethyl amide) was kindly provided by Dr. Roy Black (Immunex, Seattle, WA). Staurosporine, camptothecin, ALLN (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-NorLeu-CHO), and ionomycin were obtained from Sigma, and CompleteTM-EDTA protease inhibitor mix was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Apoptosis was induced in confluent monolayers of cells cultivated in 6-well dishes by addition of 1 μmstaurosporine in Me2SO or 2 μg/ml camptothecin. Adherent cells were washed twice with PBS, incubated with ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm imidazole (pH 6.8), 0.1 mKCl, 0.3 m sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmMbO42−, 1 mm NaV03, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and CompleteTM-EDTA protease inhibitor mixture) for 10 min at 4 °C, and scraped off from the culture dish. Floating cells were collected by gentle centrifugation at 310 × g for 10 min and pooled with adherent cells in lysis buffer. After centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C, 20,800 ×g), the supernatant was used for Western blotting. Total protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined with the BCA protein assay system (Pierce). For inhibitor studies, cells were preincubated for 30 min with 50 μm Z-DEVD-FMK and/or 50 μm TAPI before addition of staurosporine. For Western blot analysis of cell lysates, 50 μg of total protein in 4× SDS loading buffer was separated on 14% ProSieve SDS-polyacrylamide gels (FMC BioProducts obtained from Biozym, Hess. Oldendorf, Germany) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (ImmobilonTM-P, Millipore). Membranes were blocked with TST buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with first antibody at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in TST for 1 h. After three washes, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody diluted 1:10,000 in TST. After washing, chemoluminescence detection was performed by exposure of Lumi-Light Western blotting substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)-treated membranes to Biomax MR films (Kodak, Rochester, NY). For quantification of the chemoluminescence signals, membranes were scanned with a FujiFilm LAS-1000 system and analyzed with the Image Gauge version 3.2 software. Molecular weights of fragments were determined using the BenchMarkTM Prestained Protein Ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). To detect the 84-kDa E-cadherin fragment released from the cell surface, cell culture supernatants were collected at different time points after induction of apoptosis. After centrifugation for 10 min at 20,800 × g, 1 ml of the supernatant was pre-cleared by incubation with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C under constant agitation. Protein A beads were removed by centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, 0.5 μg of HECD-1 antibody or 5 μg of DECMA-1 antibody were added. After 30 min at 4 °C, 40 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads were added and incubated for 1 h as described above. Protein A beads were sedimented by centrifugation (1 min, 2700 × g, 4 °C), washed five times with wash buffer (50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm imidazole (pH 6.8), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100), and resuspended in 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. After boiling, proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting was performed as described above. Cells were grown on glass coverslips. 3 h or 6 h after induction of apoptosis, cells were briefly washed with PBS and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 min. Subsequently, cells were washed in PBS, and after blocking with 0.1% (v/v) goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, cells were incubated with anti-E-cadherin antibodies for 30 min at room temperature (0.5 μg/ml for anti-E-cadherin clone 36 and 2 μg/ml for anti-HECD-1). After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa FluorTM 488 goat anti-mouse IgG for another 30 min and washed again before mounting in elvanol. For double staining, cells were washed twice with prewarmed PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS + 25 mmglycine) for 5 min. After two additional washes with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min and subsequently blocked with 0.1% (v/v) goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. E-cadherin staining was performed as described above, and subsequent phalloidin staining was performed with Alexa FluorTM 594 phalloidin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis and photography were performed on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with × 63 magnification at excitation wavelengths of 543 and 488 nm. Details on the microscopy setup are available on request. GST·ECT was expressed inEscherichia coli as described (41Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5 μg of recombinant protein were digested with 50 ng of recombinant caspase-3, -6, or -7 in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm leupeptin, 200 μg/ml aprotinin at 37 °C for 2–4 h. After separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, cleavage products were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Coomassie-stained protein bands were excised, destained in 60% acetonitrile, and analyzed by Edman sequencing on a Procise sequencer (Applied Biosystems). To investigate the fate of E-cadherin during programmed cell death, lysates of MDCK cells were examined by Western analysis upon induction of apoptosis by staurosporine treatment. Changes in morphology, fragmentation of the nucleus, and detachment from the substrate indicated that MDCK cells responded to the apoptotic stimulus. Nearly all full-length E-cadherin was cleaved 24 h after addition of staurosporine (Fig. 1 A). As determined by quantitative chemoluminescence imaging, 50% of E-cadherin was proteolytically processed during the first 11–13 h of staurosporine treatment (Fig. 1 B). Distinct cleavage products of E-cadherin with apparent molecular masses of about 24 kDa and 29 kDa, designated fragment 1 and fragment 2, respectively, were detectable by 3 h after induction of apoptosis with an antibody (clone C36) directed against the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin. A 35-kDa polypeptide band reacting with the antibody was also present in nonapoptotic cells, indicating that this band is not related to the apoptotic cleavage of E-cadherin. Furthermore, by comparing Ltk− cells and E-cadherin-transfected Ltk−cells, it could be shown that this band reflects nonspecific cross-reactivity of the antibody with an unknown polypeptide. The 35-kDa band was detected in Ltk− and E-cadherin-transfected Ltk− cells, whereas a 120-kDa cadherin band was only present in E-cadherin-transfected Ltk− cells (data not shown). The accumulation of fragments 1 and 2 peaked at about 6 h and subsequently declined over the next 6 h, indicating that these fragments were further degraded (Fig. 1, A and B). This might explain why the intensity of the signals for the cleavage products is considerably weaker than the signal for full-length cadherin at all time points following induction of apoptosis. In the presence of ALLN, fragment 1 was stabilized, suggesting that further degradation of fragment 1 might be a proteasome-mediated process (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, the amount of fragment 2 was not affected by ALLN, suggesting that this fragment might be an intermediate product. Similar results were obtained after induction of apoptosis with camptothecin, independent of whether MDCK or the human mammary epithelial cell line H184A1 was used (Fig. 1 D), confirming that the described fragmentation of E-cadherin is not cell-line specific. To find out whether fragments 1 and 2 were generated by caspase cleavage, the membrane-permeable irreversible caspase inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK was added to the cultured cells prior to staurosporine treatment, and cell lysates were analyzed for E-cadherin 6 h later. In the presence of Z-DEVD-FMK, formation of fragment 1 was completely blocked, whereas formation of fragment 2 was not affected (Fig. 2). This observation explains why, despite the presence of caspase-inhibitor, full-length E-cadherin still was proteolytically processed (data not shown) and suggests that E-cadherin is targeted by a distinct second cleavage event. Because fragment 1 was detected with an antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin, and generation of fragment 1 was blocked by Z-DEVD-FMK, it was expected that this fragment resulted from a caspase-mediated intracellular cleavage event. To identify the cleavage site and the caspase(s) responsible for this cleavage, recombinant mouse E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST·ECT) was digestedin vitro with recombinant caspase-3, -6, and -7, respectively. GST·ECT was efficiently digested by caspase-3, resulting in the formation of 30- and 24-kDa cleavage products (Fig.3 A). Caspase-7 generated fragments of identical molecular mass, however, with a markedly reduced efficiency and thus were barely detectable. Caspase-6 treatment did not generate detectable cleavage products at all. Treatment with the caspase inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK blocked the generation of the 24-kDa fragment (Fig. 3 A). Edman degradation revealed that the 30-kDa fragment represented the N terminus of the GST moiety. The amino acid sequence obtained from the 24-kDa fragment precisely defined the caspase-3 cleavage site C-terminal to Asp752 in an Asp-Asp-Asp-Thr-Arg-Asp 752-Asn-Val-Tyr-Tyr motif. This site is highly conserved in different species, located next to the transmembrane domain, and represents the only caspase-3 consensus sequence in the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 3 C). The 24-kDa in vitro cleavage product and fragment 1 producedin vivo in apoptotic cells comigrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, indicating that both fragments are identical (Fig.3 B). The discrepancy in the apparent (24 kDa) and calculated molecular masses (15 kDa) for this E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain fragment might be explained by an unusual migration behavior of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or because of migration differences of molecular mass standards. Further evidence that caspase-3 is the major caspase responsible for cleavage of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail in apoptotic cells was given by analyses of MCF-7 cells that have been previously shown to be deficient in caspase-3 (17Jaenicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Induction of apoptosis in these cells did not result in the generation of detectable amounts of fragments 1 and 2, respectively. In contrast, in MCF-7 cells that have been stably transfected with caspase-3, both fragments were generated (Fig.4). The inhibitor studies and the mapping of the caspase-3 cleavage site to Asp752 proximal to the transmembrane segment of E-cadherin suggested that fragment 2 was generated by an extracellular cleavage event. This, however, should result in an extracellular domain fragment that is released from the cell surface into the culture medium. Indeed, in immunoprecipitation experiments with antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of E-cadherin, increasing amounts of an 84-kDa polypeptide (fragment 3) were precipitated from cell culture supernatants of apoptotic cells with time after staurosporine addition (Fig.5). Next we wanted to characterize the enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of the 84-kDa extracellular fragment of E-cadherin. There is clear evidence now that shedding of the extracellular domain of a number of cell surface proteins is a regulated process that can be blocked by metalloproteinase inhibitors (42Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). To test whether the formation of the 84-kDa extracellular fragment of E-cadherin is mediated by this type of shedding protease, inhibitor studies were performed. In the presence of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor I, no significant inhibitory effect was detected (data not shown). In contrast, TAPI, a metalloproteinase inhibitor that was shown to block tumor necrosis factor-α convertase (43Mohler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. Alderson M. Kerwar S.S. Torrance D.S. Otten-Evans C. Greenstreet T. Weerawarna K. Kronheim S.R. Petersen M. Gerhart M. Kozlosky C.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), markedly inhibited formation of E-cadherin fragment 3 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6 A). Consistent with this observation, generation of fragment 2 was also reduced, whereas formation of fragment 1 was unaffected (Fig. 6 B,lane 3). In the presence of both TAPI and caspase inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK, formation of both fragments was significantly inhibited (Fig. 6 B, lane 4). Moreover, in cells treated with both inhibitors the amount of full-length E-cadherin was nearly comparable with nonapoptotic control cells (Fig. 6 B,lane 4). In consequence, TAPI treatment should result in the formation of a new cleavage product that contains the E-cadherin transmembrane domain and thus remains attached to the membrane. Indeed, with an antibody directed against the extracellular domain of E-cadherin, we could identify a fragment of about 88 kDa (fragment 4) in Western blots from lysates of TAPI-treated apoptotic H184A1 cells (Fig. 6 C, lane 1). The 88-kDa fragment was undetectable in apoptotic cells not treated with TAPI (Fig.6 C, lane 3). In MDCK cells a TAPI-dependent reduction of fragment 3 (data not shown) and generation of fragment 4 were even more prominent (Fig. 6 D,lane 3). Caspase-3 cleavage of E-cadherin cytoplasmic domains proximal to the transmembrane region was expected to release fragment 1 into the cytosol. To analyze this, E-cadherin and E-cadherin fragments were localized in apoptotic cells by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Staining of E-cadherin at the plasma membrane of MDCK cells with anti-E-cadherin C36 antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin was reduced and became diffuse after onset of apoptosis. Cells started to shrink, and E-cadherin cell surface staining was finally undetectable in cells that had lost their cell-cell contacts. Concomitant with cell rounding and disintegration of cell nuclei, E-cadherin staining became detectable in the cytoplasm, confirming the release of the E-cadherin fragment 1 into the cytosol (Fig.7 A, a–c). Cells treated with Z-DEVD-FMK retained staining of E-cadherin at the plasma membrane, and in consequence cytoplasmic E-cadherin staining was reduced (Fig. 7 A, d). Moreover, in the presence of the caspase inhibitor, STS-treated cells exhibited significantly less rounding, and morphological integrity was less affected. Confocal immunofluorescence analysis of H184A1 cells with antibody HECD-1 directed against the extracellular domain also showed a reduction of E-cadherin staining at the cell membrane. TAPI treatment inhibited this decrease in E-cadherin staining, showing that by blocking the extracellular cleavage event, fragment 4 containing the transmembrane domain remained attached in the cell membrane. Furthermore, cell morphology appeared to be less affected in these cells. E-cadherin staining in cells treated with both TAPI and Z-DEVD-FM"

In the nervous system, calcium entry contributes toward the electrical properties of neurons, modulates calcium-dependent enzymes and ion channels, controls calcium-dependent gene transcription, and initiates the release of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Electrophysiological analyses have categorized native calcium currents into two major classes that differ in their voltage activation properties. High voltage-activated (HVA)1 calcium channels represent a diverse family of channels that first activate at relatively depolarized potentials (usually > −40 mV) and that display distinct pharmacological characteristics (L-type, N-type, P/Q-type, and R-type; Refs. 1Catterall W.A.

In contrast to activation for HVA calcium channels, low voltage-activated (LVA or T-type) calcium channels first activate with relatively small depolarizations (between −80 and −60 mV) and have a poorly defined pharmacology. In addition to their distinct low voltage dependence of activation, T-type calcium channels also exhibit unique voltage-dependent kinetics, small single channel conductance, rapid inactivation, slow deactivation, and a relatively higher permeability to Ca2+compared with Ba2+ (3Huguenard J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The initial evidence for the existence of LVA calcium currents was obtained from neurons of the inferior olivary nucleus by Llinas and Yarom (4Llinas R. Yarom Y. J. Physiol.

T-type channels are of interest, since they are responsible for rebound burst firing in central neurons and are implicated in normal brain functions such as slow wave sleep and in diseased states such as epilepsy (3Huguenard J.R.

The biophysical characterization of T-type channels has been complicated by the presence of multiple types of calcium currents in neurons and other cells as well as a lack of specific pharmacological tools. In addition, there is considerable heterogeneity in the reported activation, inactivation, permeation, and pharmacology of neuronal T-type currents. T-type calcium channels represent the most recent calcium channel family to be described at the molecular level (21Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), although there remains little known concerning their biochemical composition. In the present paper, the molecular and electrophysiological characteristics of three members of the rat brain T-type calcium channel family (α1G, α1H, and α1I) are reported. This is the first report defining the molecular and biophysical properties of three distinct T-type calcium channels isolated from the same tissue and species. Electrophysiological recordings describe α1G, α1H, and α1I currents with many distinguishing characteristics typical of T-type currents present in native cells, although they each also possess distinct kinetics, inactivation profiles, and divalent ion permeabilities. We also find evidence for the generation of multiple α1I variants by alternative splicing and for the unique developmental and spatial expression of α1G, α1H, and α1I T-type calcium channels in the rat CNS. To identify novel calcium channel subtypes, oligonucleotides were designed based on structurally conserved elements found in all cloned mammalian HVA calcium channels (rat brain α1A, GTCAAAACTCAGGCCTTCTA and AACGTGTTCTTGGCTATCGCGGTG; rat brain α1B, GTGAAAGCACAGAGCTTCTACTGG and AACGTTTTCTTGGCCATTGCTGTG; rat brain α1C, GTTAAATCCAACGTCTTCTACTGG and AATGTGTTCTTGGCCATTGCGGTG; rat brain α1D, GTGAAGTCTGTCACGTTTTACTGG and AAGCTCTTCTTGGCCATTGCTGTA; rat brain α1E, GTCAAGTCGGCAAGTGTTCTTA and AATGTATTCTTGGCTATCGC). The oligonucleotide sequences were subsequently utilized to “screen” the entire Caenorhabditis elegans genome data base (ACeDB) and resulted in the identification of five potential voltage-dependent ion channels in C. elegans(cosmids and reading frames: C11D2.6, C27F2.3, C54D2.5, C48A7.1, and T02C5.5). Three of the C. elegans genes (C54D2.5, C48A7.1, and T02C5.5) were determined to represent homologues of rat and human calcium channels expressed in nerve, muscle, and cardiovascular tissues, while the other two genes (C11D2.6 and C27F2.3) represent novel four domain-type ion channels. The T02C5.5 open reading frame encodes the unc-2 gene, which is a calcium channel α1 subunit homologous to the mammalian α1A, α1B, and α1E subtypes, while C48A7.1 encodes egl-19, a nematode calcium channel α1subunit homologous to the mammalian α1C, α1D, α1F, and α1S L-type channels. Mammalian homologues of the C. elegans C54D2.5 reading frame were identified by “screening” the GenBankTM expressed sequence tag data bank with C54D2.5. Four of the resulting human expressed sequence tags (H55225, H55617,H55223, and H55544) were judged to encode novel calcium channel-like proteins. Utilizing these sequences, synthetic oligonucleotide primers were generated and used to amplify human brain total RNA and identified a 567-bp fragment corresponding to a portion of human brain α1I. The 567-bp human polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment was labeled by random priming and used to screen 750,000 plaque-forming units of a rat brain cDNA library enriched for cDNAs greater than 4 kb (26Snutch T.P. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3391-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). After four rounds of screening, 28 positives were isolated, and their ends were sequenced. Of these, 19 encoded for α1G, four for α1H, and five for the α1I subunit. The full-length rat brain α1G, α1H, and α1I clones were assembled in pBluescript SK from overlapping cDNAs. Both strands of the full-length clones were sequenced using a modified dideoxynucleotide protocol and Sequenase version 2.1 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and then subcloned into the vertebrate expression vector pCDNA-3 (Invitrogen). Isoforms of the α1I subunit were identified by DNA sequence analysis of multiple rat brain α1I cDNA clones. To confirm that the clones represented bona fide expressed transcripts, reverse transcriptase and PCR (RT-PCR) was performed with total rat brain RNA. The reactions consisted of 1 μg of RNA, 1× RT buffer, 10 mm dNTPs, 5 units of RT (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10 pmol of the 3′-oligonucleotide at 42 °C for 90 min. The 50-μl PCR was composed of 1 μl of rat brain cDNA/RNA, 1× PCR buffer, 1.25 mm dNTPs, 2 units of Taq polymerase, and 20 pmol of each oligonucleotide (variant 1, 5′-ACTCTGGAAGGCTGGGTGGAG-3′ and 5′-GAGAACGAGGCACAAGTTGATC-3′; variant 2, 5′-ATGGGTACTGCCCCCCGCCTCTCA-3′ and 5′-CAAGGATCGCTGATCATAGCTC-3′; and variant 3, 5′-ATCCGTATCATGCGTGTTCTGCG-3′ and 5-CCACTGGCAGAGCTGTACACTG-3′). The reactions were preheated for 15 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The fidelity of all three variants and the wild type α1I cDNA was confirmed by sequencing of both strands. To confirm that the α1I isoforms represented alternatively spliced variants of the α1I gene, PCR was used to amplify portions of rat genomic DNA flanking the regions of interest. Oligonucleotides on either side of the putative introns were synthesized for use in the PCR to determine splice variants (as above). The 50-μl PCR was composed of 1 ng of rat genomic DNA, 1× PCR buffer, 1.25 mm dNTPs, 2 units of Taq polymerase, and 20 pmol of each oligonucleotide. The reactions were placed into a preheated PCR block for 15 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles (30 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel, blotted to a nylon membrane, and then probed with a γ-32P-radiolabeled intron-specific oligonucleotide probe to identify the genomic band of interest. Fragments hybridizing to the probes were cut out and cloned into pGem-T Easy (Promega), and their DNA sequence was determined. Total cellular RNA was isolated from adult rat tissues; Northern blot analysis was performed with RNA size markers (Life Technologies), total RNA (30 μg/lane) from spinal cord, pons/medulla, cerebellum, striatum, hypothalamus/thalamus, hippocampus, cortex, olfactory bulb, and whole brain; and separated through a 1.1% agarose gel containing 1.1m formaldehyde and then transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane by capillary blot. Hybridization was performed independently for each α1 subunit, and the radiolabeled probe was allowed to decay between probe hybridization. Northern blot hybridization conditions utilized 5× SSPE, 0.3% SDS, 10 μg/μl tRNA, 30 μg/μl salmon sperm blocking DNA, and a random-primed cDNA probe that corresponds to nucleotides 2523–3397 of the α1I clone, 3568–4426 of the α1G clone, or 3391–4231 of the α1H cDNA clone. To detect low levels of T-type channel expression, RT-PCR analysis of T-type channel expression within different brain regions was performed. The reaction consisted of 1 μg of RNA, 1× RT buffer, 10 mm dNTPs, 5 units of RT (Life Technologies), and 10 pmol of the α1G oligonucleotide (5′-CAGGAGACGAAACCTTGA-3′) α1H oligonucleotide (5′-GGAGACGCGTAGCCTGTT-3′), or α1I oligonucleotide (5′-CAGGATCCGGAACTTGTT-3′) at 42 °C for 90 min. From this reaction, 5 μl was removed and added to a 50-μl PCR composed of 1× PCR buffer, 1.25 mm dNTPs, 2 units of Taq, 20 pmol of the 3′-oligonucleotide, and 20 pmol of the 5′-oligonucleotide (α1G-5′-TCAGAGCCTGATTTCTTT-3′, α1H-5′-GACGAGGATAAGACGTCT-3′, or α1I-5′-GATGAGGACCAGAGCTCA-3′). The reactions were placed into a preheated PCR block for 35 cycles (1 min at 95 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, 45 s at 72 °C). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel, blotted to a nylon membrane, and then probed with a γ-32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe specific for each of the three channels. As a positive control, 1 μg of RNA from each brain region was amplified by 35 cycles (1 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 30 s at 72 °C) with α-tubulin oligonucleotides (5′-CAGGTGTCCACGGCTGTGGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGGCTCCATCGAAACGCAG-3′). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293; tsa-201) were grown in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin streptomycin to 80% confluence. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O2 and 5% CO2, and every 2–3 days they were enzymatically dissociated with trypsin-EDTA and plated on 35-mm Petri dishes 12 h prior to transfection. A standard calcium phosphate procedure was used to transiently transfect cells. Rat α1G (3 μg), rat α1H (3 μg), and rat α1I (3 μg) calcium channel subunits were cotransfected with CD8 (2 μg) marker plasmid, and 15 μg pBluescript SK carrier DNA for a total of 20 μg of cDNA. Transiently transfected cells were selected for expression of CD8 by adherence of Dynabeads as described previously (27Sutton K.G. McRory J.E. Guthrie H. Murphy T.H. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Functional expression in transfected cells was evaluated 24–48 h after transfection using the whole-cell patch clamp technique (28Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). The external recording solution contained (unless otherwise noted) 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm TEA-Cl, 92 mmCsCl, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.2. The internal pipette solution contained 105 mm CsCl, 25 mm TEA-Cl, 1 mm CaCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Whole-cell currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B or 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City CA), controlled and monitored with a PC running pCLAMP software version 6.03 (Axon Instruments). Patch pipettes (Sutter borosilicate glass BF150-86-10) were pulled using a Sutter P-87 puller and fire-polished using a Narishige microforge, and they showed a resistance of 2.5–4 megaohms when filled with internal solution. Series resistance had typical values of 7–10 megaohms and was electronically compensated by at least 60%. Whole-cell currents never exceeded 2 nA, limiting errors in voltage to a few mV. Only cells exhibiting adequate voltage control (judged by smoothly rising current-voltage (I-V) relationship and monoexponential decay of capacitive currents) were included in the analysis. The bath was connected to ground via a 3m KCl agar bridge. Gigaohm seals were formed directly in the external control solution, and all recordings were performed at room temperature (20–24 °C). Data were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz using the built-in Bessel filter of the amplifier, and in most cases, subtraction of capacitance and leakage current was carried out on-line using the P/4 protocol. Recordings were analyzed using Clampfit 6.03 (Axon Instruments), and figures and fittings utilized the software program Microcal Origin (version 3.78). Calcium current activation curves were constructed by converting the peak current values from theI-V relationships to conductance using the equationg Ca =I peak/(V c −E Ca), where I peak is the peak calcium current, V c the command pulse potential, and E Ca the apparent calcium reversal potential obtained by linear extrapolation of the current values in the ascending portion of the I-V curve. Conductance values were then normalized and fitted to standard Boltzman relations:g/g max = (1 + (exp(−V −V 0.5a)/k a)) − 1, where g is the peak conductance,g max is the maximal peak calcium conductance,V 0.5a is the midpoint of the activation curve, and k a is the activation slope factor. Steady-state inactivation curves were obtained by evoking calcium currents with a test depolarization to −30 mV applied at the end of 15-s prepulses from −120 to −50 mV. The steady-state inactivation curves were constructed by plotting the normalized current during the test pulse as a function of the conditioning potential. The data were fitted with a Boltzman equation:I/I max = (1 + exp((V− V 0.5i/k i)) − 1, where I is the peak current, I maxis the peak current when the conditioning pulse was −120 mV,V and V 0.5i are the conditioning potential and the half-inactivation potential, respectively, and k i is the inactivation slope factor. The electrophysiological properties of the α1G, α1H, and α1I channels were modeled using modified Hodgkin-Huxley equations for T-type calcium channels produced by Huguenard and McCormick (29Huguenard J.R. McCormick D.A. J. Neurophysiol. 1992; 68: 1373-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The values for voltage-dependent activation and inactivation, as well as the time constants for activation, inactivation, and deactivation were obtained from whole-cell recordings of α1G, α1H, or α1I using 2 mm calcium as the charge carrier. These values were substituted for the data obtained from recordings of T-type calcium currents of juvenile rat thalamic relay neurons (29Huguenard J.R. McCormick D.A. J. Neurophysiol. 1992; 68: 1373-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Simulated current clamp recordings of thalamic relay neurons were generated using the C-Clamp software program based on the major currents of these cells (30McCormick D.A. Huguenard J.R. J. Neurophysiol. 1992; 68: 1384-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and substitution of α1G, α1H, or α1I for the native T-type currents. Screening of an expressed sequence tag data bank with the C. elegans C54D2.5 open reading frame described several unidentified human expressed sequence tag sequences (H55225, H55617, H55223, andH55544), which were then used to design synthetic oligonucleotides and amplify a 567-bp α1I subunit fragment from human brain total RNA (see Ref. 21Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M. Rees M. Lee J.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar for an alternative strategy). Utilizing the human 567-bp fragment as a probe, full-length rat brain cDNAs homologous to C54D2.5 were isolated from a rat brain cDNA library and shown by sequence analysis to encode three different members of the T-type calcium channel family (α1G, α1H, and α1I) (Fig. 1). Similar to HVA calcium channels and sodium channels, all three putative rat brain T-type channel subunits possess four structural domains linked by intracellular loops, a conserved pore region (P-loop), and voltage sensors (S4 segments) in each of the four domains. In contrast to the HVA calcium channel subunits, which all possess a conserved glutamate within their P-loops, the T-type channels have aspartate residues substituted in domain III and IV P-loops. Additional differences from HVA channels include no apparent β-subunit binding site in the domain I-II linker (31Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and no EF hand region (32Babitch J.

The overall conservation of aa sequence is highest between the α1G and α1H subunits (56% identity), with the α1I protein having 53% identity to α1Hand 49% identity to αIG. Most of the sequence conservation is found in the membrane-spanning regions with substantially less identity in the carboxyl tail and putative intra- and extracellular loops. Sequence analysis of additional α1I cDNAs showed that at least four α1I variants are expressed in rat brain. Compared with the “wild type” α1I-a isoform, the predicted primary sequence of the α1I-b variant is missing three residues (FIY) in domain I S6, the α1I-cvariant has a six-aa deletion in the domain II-III linker, and the α1I-d variant contains a 13-aa insertion in the putative cytoplasmic linker between domain IV S4 and S5 (Fig.2 A). Since variations in cDNA sequence may be due to RT artifacts, it is important to confirm that putative variants are in fact encoded in the genome. Along this line, rat genomic DNA was examined in the regions flanking the putative splice junctions of the α1I variants. Fig.2 B shows that the α1I-b, α1I-c, and α1I-d variants all result from the apparent use of alternative 5′ splice junction sites. In the case of α1I-d, the alternative 5′ junction matches the 5′ GT splice consensus site, while in α1I-b and α1I-c the 5′ sites are nontypical TT and GA intronic junctions. RT-PCR of adult rat brain RNA confirmed that all four α1I variants are expressed in the rat CNS (data not shown). Regional expression of the α1G, α1H, and α1I subunits was carried out by Northern blot using the unique domain II-III linkers of each channel as a probe and total RNA isolated from different brain regions of adult rats. The α1G probe (Fig.3 A) hybridized to a single band at ∼ 10 kb in all brain regions, while the α1H probe hybridized (Fig. 3 B) to a single band at ∼8.5 kb in all brain regions. In contrast, the α1I probe hybridized to an ∼11-kb mRNA found only in the adult striatum (Fig. 3 C). No α1ImRNA signal was detected in total RNA isolated from the different brain regions upon exposure of the autoradiogram for a further 7 days at −80 °C with intensifying screens. The selective expression of α1I mRNA in the adult striatum is in contrast to the widespread distribution of α1I expression previously reported (23Talley E.M. Cribbs L.L. Lee J.H. Daud A. Perez-Reyes E. Bayliss D.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1895-1911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to detect lesser amounts of mRNA than that possible with Northern blots, RT-PCR was performed on the same brain RNA samples. Fig.4 A shows that the RT-PCR results confirm the Northern blot results, with α1ImRNA being detected specifically in the adult striatum and α1G and α1H expressed ubiquitously throughout the adult rat brain. Fig. 4 B shows RT-PCR to compare α1I transcripts using total RNA isolated from 6-week-old and adult rat brain. Within the juvenile rat brain α1I is expressed in all brain regions, while again α1I is selectively expressed in the striatum in adult brain. Taken together, these results suggest the differential expression of α1I calcium channels during CNS development. Transient expression in HEK cells showed that consistent with low voltage-activated channels the mean current-voltage relationships of the α1I, α1G, and α1H channels all activate at negative potentials (Fig. 5 a). All recordings were carried out using 2 mm calcium as a charge carrier and resulted from the expression of individual α1 subunits alone. Currents were evoked from a holding potential of −110 mV to voltages from −90 to 0 mV for α1H and α1I and from −80 to 0 mV for α1G. Typically, the threshold for current activation under these ionic conditions was between −80 and −60 mV with peak amplitudes occurring between −45 and −35 mV. Fig. 5, b–d, illustrates representative current traces of the three T-type calcium channels obtained during 150-ms test pulses from −90 to 0 mV. All of the channels show substantial inactivation during the test pulse, although α1I shows much slower activation and inactivation kinetics than α1G and α1H. Upon coexpression with the β1b and α2δ subunits associated with the HVA calcium channels, we did not observe any functional effects on current-voltage relations, steady-state inactivation, or channel kinetics (data not shown). To further examine the voltage dependence of the kinetic parameters, records from each channel subtype were obtained at different potentials, and both the activation time constant (τact) and the inactivation time constant (τinact) were measured. To quantify macroscopic activation and inactivation rates, we fitted single-exponential functions to the activating and inactivating segments of individual test currents. Superimposing current traces revealed distinct activation and inactivation kinetics of the three channel types (Fig.6 a). The α1IT-type calcium channel activated and inactivated more slowly than the other two channels, while α1G possessed the fastest activation and inactivation kinetics.

Targeted disruption of the α-TTP gene revealed that α-tocopherol concentration in the circulation was regulated by α-TTPexpression levels. Male α-TTP−/− mice were fertile; however, placentas of pregnant α-TTP−/− females were severely impaired with marked reduction of labyrinthine trophoblasts, and the embryos died at mid-gestation even when fertilized eggs of α-TTP+/+ mice were transferred into α-TTP−/− recipients.

Patients with ataxia and isolated vitamin E deficiency (AVED)1 have low or undetectable serum vitamin E concentrations and exhibit neurological dysfunction and muscular weakness. It is now established that α-tocopherol transfer protein (α-TTP), a cytosolic liver protein known to specifically bind to α-tocopherol (1Sato Y. Hagiwara K. Arai H. Inoue K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), is defective in AVED patients (2Ouahchi K. Arita M. Kayden H. Hentati F. Hamida M.B. Sokol R. Arai H. Inoue K. Mandel J-L. Koenig M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), indicating that α-TTP is a major determinant of plasma α-tocopherol level. Although α-tocopherol was initially identified as an anti-sterility factor to prevent abortion (3Evans H.M. Bishop K.S. Science. 1922; 56: 650-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), the mechanism of action and the molecules responsible for its anti-sterility effect remain unknown. One of the reasons for this is that vitamin E is difficult to deplete from tissues and requires elaborate manipulations to cause deficiency symptoms to occur in experimental animals. In this study, we established a mouse model lacking α-TTP by targeted mutagenesis. This animal model for human AVED patients is suitable for examination of the complex pathophysiology of diseases associated with vitamin E deficiency and/or caused by oxidative stress. Here we examined the role of α-TTP in pregnancy and embryogenesis using our new animal model. An α-TTP targeting vector was constructed from an 8.8-kb α-TTP genome fragment encompassing exon 1. We inserted a fragment of PGK-neo cassette into the SmaI-SmaI site positioned 5′ and 3′ to exon 1 and flanked a 1.8-kb fragment of HSV-tk gene downstream of exon 2. AB2.2-Prime ES cells (Lexicon Genetics) or A3–1 ES (4Azuma S. Toyoda Y. Jpn. J. Anim. Reprod. 1991; 37: 37-43Crossref Google Scholar) cells were transfected by electroporation with a linearized targeting vector. G418/gancyclovir-resistant clones were screened by PCR, and then ES cells containing the disrupted allele were injected into C57BL/6J (CLEA, Japan) blastocysts as described previously (5Kurihara Y. Kurihara H. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Maemura K. Nagai R. Oda H. Kuwaki T. Cao W-H. Kamada N. Jishage K. Ouchi Y. Azuma S. Toyoda Y. Ishikawa T. Kumada M. Yazaki Y. Nature. 1994; 368: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). To obtain α-TTP+/− mutants, chimeras were mated with C57BL/6J females. α-TTP−/− mutant mice were produced from α-TTP+/− crosses. Genotypes were determined by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot analysis of DNA from tail tissue. The PCR primer pairs (ot198, 5′-AGCCCACACAAAAATGAAAAACGTCTCCAAG-3′ and PGK-1, 5′-GCTAAAGCGCATGCTCCAGACTGCCTTG-3′) were used to detect the α-TTP mutant allele. PCR primer pairs (ot198 and TTPN17, 5′-TCTCTGCAATGCCCGCCGTGCTGTCCCG-3′) were used to detect the α-TTP wild-type allele. After an initial hot start at 94 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min and 20 s) were run using Takara EXTaq (TaKaRa, Japan). The expected PCR products of wild-type and mutant alleles were 990 and 950 bp, respectively. Genomic DNA from mutant mice were analyzed by Southern blotting using probe A including exon 1 and mouse α-TTP cDNA (open-reading frame) probe, after digestion with EcoRI. The resultant two fragments, which had approximately the same number of nucleotides, were mixed and used for probe A. Mouse cDNA probe for α-TTP was prepared by RT-PCR with mouse liver total RNA. In the next step, 15 μg of genomic DNA was electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel and transferred onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 5× SSPE, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 250 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA with 32P-labeled probe. The membranes were washed for 30 min in 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS, and then in 0.5× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. The 3.75-kb EcoRI fragment represents the wild-type allele. Total RNA was extracted from the liver of each adult mouse genotype and from uterus, placentas, and embryos of α-TTP+/+ mice using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Japan). 10 μg of total RNA from liver and 20 μg of total RNA from uterus, placenta, and embryo were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and transferred onto a Hybond N+ membrane. The membranes were hybridized and washed using the method described above for Southern blotting. Mice were fed a normal (36 mg of α-tocopherol/kg diet) or α-tocopherol-supplemented diet (600 mg of α-tocopherol/kg diet) after weaning. These diets were prepared from a vitamin E-deficient diet (Funabashi Farm, Chiba, Japan) supplemented with 5.0% (w/w) stripped corn oil (Tama Biochemical, Tokyo, Japan) andd-α tocopherol. d-α-Tocopherol was kindly provided by Eisai Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Blood samples were collected from overnight fasted animals, and plasma was separated from whole blood by centrifugation. Plasma (50 μl) was diluted with 950 μl of phosphate buffered saline and was used for the following procedure. Diluted plasma was mixed with 1 ml of 6% pyrogallol in ethanol, and 2.0 μg of tocol was subsequently added as an internal standard and mixed vigorously. After incubation at 70 °C for 2 min, 0.2 ml of 60% KOH was added, and the mixture was incubated at 70 °C for 30 min. In the next step, 5 ml of n-hexane and 2.5 ml of water were added, and the mixture was mixed vigorously and then centrifuged at room temperature. The hexane layer was saved and the hexane extracts were evaporated under nitrogen. The residue was redissolved in 100 ml of ethanol and subjected to HPLC analysis and electrochemical detection. The HPLC system was an IRIKA P-530 (IRIKA, Kyoto) with an IRIKA RP-18 column (4 × 250 mm). The eluent was methanol/water/NaClO4 at a ratio of 1000:2:7 (v/v/w) and a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Detection was performed with an IRIKA Amperometric E-520 detector. The retention time was 6.88 min for tocol, which was used as an internal standard, and 10.88 min for α-tocopherol as described previously (6Kim H.S. Arai H. Arita M. Sato Y. Ogihara T. Inoue K. Mino M. Tamai H. Free Radic. Res. 1998; 28: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). α-TTP+/+ and α-TTP−/− embryos at the 2-cell stage were transferred to the oviduct of α-TTP−/− or α-TTP+/+recipients on day 0.5 of pseudopregnancy, respectively, as described previously (7Suzuki H. Ueda O. Kamada N. Jishage K. Katoh M. Shino M. J. Mamm. Ova. Res. 1994; 11: 49-53Google Scholar). The recipients were sacrificed on 18.5 days postcoitum (dpc). To determine the time of death, α-TTP+/+ and α-TTP−/− mutant females were mated with C57BL/6J males, and then the pregnant females were sacrificed between 9.5 and 14.5 dpc. The death of embryos was confirmed by the absence of a heartbeat. Embryos and placentas with and/or without the uterine horns were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin for up to 24 h. Embryos and uterine horn segments were subsequently processed into paraffin sections and deparaffinized for staining with hematoxylin/eosin before microscopic analysis. Mice were fed a commercial diet (CE-2, CLEA Japan, containing 45 mg/kg of d-α-tocopherol) after weaning. The α-TTP+/+ and α-TTP−/− mutant females were mated with C57BL/6J males. At 0.5 dpc after mating, mice were fed α-tocopherol supplementation (CE-2 with supplementaryd-α-tocopherol, 567 mg/kg), synthetic antioxidant (CE-2 with 0.65% BO-653) diet, or CE-2 as a control. Mothers were sacrificed at 18.5 dpc to examine the site of implantation and fetuses. All experiments described in the present study were conducted in accordance with the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Research Animals promulgated by Chugai Pharmaceutical, Shizuoka, Japan. To delete the initiation codon for α-TTP, a targeting vector was designed in which the entire exon 1 was replaced by a neomycin-resistance cassette (Fig.1 A). This targeting vector was introduced into ES cells by electroporation, and then the ES cells were used to introduce vector into the mouse germline. We obtained three independent mutant mouse lines. Two lines (clone nos. L236 and L254) were derived from AB2.2-Prime ES cells and one line (clone no. C229) was derived from A3–1 ES cells. The chimeras of these lines were bred with C57BL/6J to produce heterozygous mice for α-TTP. Mice from the L236 and C229 lines were bred and used for further analysis. When heterozygous mice were interbred, approximately one-fourth of the offspring were α-TTP−/− mutants as expected for a recessive mutation (α-TTP+/+:α-TTP+/−:α-TTP−/−= 63:105:74; Fig. 1 C). Both α-TTP+/− and α-TTP−/− mice were normal in appearance and growth for at least 6 months. There were no significant differences among the genotypes in the plasma levels of VLDL, LDL, and HDL cholesterol as measured by HPLC (data not shown). When mice were fed a normal diet (36 mg of α-tocopherol/kg diet), plasma α-tocopherol concentrations were about 400 μg/dl in α-TTP+/+ mice, half of this level in α-TTP+/− mice, and undetectable in α-TTP−/− mice (Fig. 2). These results indicate that α-TTP activity in the liver is a determinant of plasma α-tocopherol levels. As shown in Table I, α-TTP−/−males were fertile. The α-TTP−/− females became pregnant after mating, but none of the four or five tested delivered offspring (Table I). Because α-TTP−/− mutants were obtained from mating α-TTP+/− males and females in a Mendelian fashion, the α-TTP−/− zygotes could develop to full-term. On the other hand, although fertilized eggs from α-TTP+/+ mice could be successfully implanted into α-TTP−/− recipients, they failed to develop to full-term (Table II). The number of live embryos (as determined by the presence of a heartbeat) of α-TTP−/− mice markedly decreased between 11.5 and 14.5 dpc (Fig. 3).Table IReproductive rates of α-TTP mutant miceGenotype in parentsNo. matingNo. implantation sitesNo. resorptionsNo. live fetuses 1-aThe mother was sacrificed on 18.5 dpc.FemaleMaleNo. (%) 1-bCalculated from number of implantation sites.No. (%) 1-bCalculated from number of implantation sites.−/−−/−51-cThe mice received a normal diet (CE-2, 45 mg α-tocopherol/kg diet).3939 (100)0 (0)−/−+/+43535 (100)0 (0)+/+−/−6696 (9)63 (91)1-a The mother was sacrificed on 18.5 dpc.1-b Calculated from number of implantation sites.1-c The mice received a normal diet (CE-2, 45 mg α-tocopherol/kg diet).

Open table in a new tab The placentas and embryos of various maternal genotypes were not morphologically different at 9.5 dpc (data not shown). However, the embryos in the uteri of α-TTP−/− mutants showed developmental failure from 10.5 dpc, and the majority of these embryos showed neural tube malformations (Fig.4 E). In normal pregnancy, the labyrinth region of the placenta starts development from around 9–9.5 dpc and then functions as a nutrient transport unit (8Kaufman M.H. The Atlas of Mouse Development. Academic Press, London1922: 476-477Google Scholar). Under normal embryogenesis, the allantoic vessels are seen by about 10 dpc where they penetrate the chorionic plate, and the ectoplacental plate is transformed into the labyrinthine part of the placenta (8Kaufman M.H. The Atlas of Mouse Development. Academic Press, London1922: 476-477Google Scholar). At this stage, the placenta could be divided into several well defined layers such as the spongiotrophoblast layer and the labyrinth region. Histological examination showed a specific abnormality limited to the labyrinth region of the α-TTP−/− mutant at 10.5 dpc (Fig. 4, C and F). In these mice, there was a marked reduction in the number of trophoblast cells, resulting in an abnormally small labyrinth. Furthermore, embryonic blood vessels were virtually absent in the trophoblast. In α-TTP+/+ mice, expression of the α-TTP gene was observed in the uterus throughout pregnancy (Fig.5), and the expression level of the α-TTP gene increased transiently after implantation on 4.5 dpc and gradually decreased by parturition. Because α-TTP expression did not increase in pseudopregnant mice at 4.5 dpc (data not shown), implantation of embryos or the development of embryos seems to have stimulated α-TTP gene expression. After about 4.5 dpc, the polar trophectoderm gives rise to extraembryonic ectoderm of the chorion, which later contributes to the trophoblast component of the labyrinth region, and the ectoplacental cone, which later produces the spongiotrophoblast layer (9Cross J.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 857: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). α-TTP was not expressed in the placenta at any time during development (Fig. 5). Although expression of the α-TTP gene in embryos was moderate, expression of this gene does not seem to be essential for embryonic development because α-TTP−/− eggs developed to full-term. These results suggest that α-TTP acts as a uterine factor and plays an important role in placental development. To examine the effect of α-tocopherol dietary supplementation on the development of the placenta and embryos in uteri of α-TTP−/− mutants, the diet was supplemented with α-tocopherol (567 mg/kg diet) either starting at 0.5 dpc after mating or throughout the experiment. With this diet, plasma α-tocopherol levels in α-TTP−/− mice were maintained within the normal range, which were close to the levels in α-TTP+/− mice fed a normal diet (Fig. 2). This therapy, as well as supplementation of a synthetic antioxidant, BO-653 (10Cynshi O. Kawabe Y. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kaise H. Nakamura M. Ohba Y. Kato Y. Tamura K. Hayasaka A. Higashida A.

Open table in a new tab Vitamin E was identified in the 1920s as a substance required for animals to have offspring (3Evans H.M. Bishop K.S. Science. 1922; 56: 650-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated α-TTP−/− mice with undetectable levels of plasma vitamin E even upon feeding with normal diet. Using these mice, we analyzed the infertility caused by vitamin E deficiency and found that the α-TTP−/− female mice have defective labyrinthine trophoblast formation during embryogenesis. The placental failure was effectively abrogated by α-tocopherol or synthetic antioxidant dietary supplement, indicating that vitamin E or other antioxidants are essential for the formation of labyrinthine trophoblasts. It is well known that the feto-placental system is prone to the attack of oxidants and that placental brush border membrane is most susceptible to peroxidation (11Williams J.W. Cunningham F.G. Mac Donald P.C. Gant N.F. Williams Obstetrics. Appleton and Lange, Norwalk, CT1989: 39Google Scholar, 12Poranen A.K. Ekblad U. Uotila P. Ahotupa M. Placenta. 1996; 17: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Oxygen-free radicals are also involved in the induction of fetal anomalies. For example, excess oxygen radical activity has been reported to be associated with disturbed embryogenesis in diabetic pregnancy (13Hagay Z.J. Weiss Y. Zusman I. Peled-Kamar M. Reece E.A. Eriksson U.J. Groner Y. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1995; 173: 1036-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Other studies have also shown a reduction in the severity of these diseases with administration of vitamin E during early pregnancy (14Sivan E. Reece E.A. Wu Y.K. Homko C.J. Polansky M. Borenstein M.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These findings, together with the present results, suggest that embryogenesis, especially the formation of the placental labyrinthine trophoblasts, is more susceptible to oxidative stress. Efficient functioning of the enzymic and nonenzymic reactive oxygen species scavengers ensures a normal intrauterine fetal growth and development (12Poranen A.K. Ekblad U. Uotila P. Ahotupa M. Placenta. 1996; 17: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 16Znamenskaia T.K. Ukr. Biokhim. Zh. 1994; 66: 93-97PubMed Google Scholar). Mukherjea and co-workers (17Sen A. Mukherjea M.

Acta. 1999; 285: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated that α-tocopherol content in the placental membrane increased as gestation progressed. In this context, it is interesting to note that the expression of the α-TTP gene in the uterus of normal mice transiently increased around 4.5 dpc, possibly leading to an increase in α-tocopherol levels supplied to the embryo. On the other hand, it was also demonstrated that vitamin E crosses the placenta from the mother to the embryo, and interestingly, of the various forms of vitamin E transferred, the RRR-α-tocopherol (best ligand for α-TTP), crossed most efficiently (19Acuff R.V. Dunworth R.G. Webb L.W. Lane J.R. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). α-TTP expressed in the uterus may explain stereospecific transport of tocopherols to the placenta, and up-regulation of α-TTP expression may result in the increase in the transport of α-tocopherol to the placenta during embryogenesis. In addition to the hepatic α-TTP, which governs plasma α-tocopherol levels, the uterine α-TTP may also be the important factor for feto-placental development. We have established α-TTP-disrupted mice as a model for vitamin E deficiency. This model should be a useful tool for the study of diseases caused by oxidation stress. We thank Y. Toyoda for encouragement, H. Tamai and M. Kobayashi (Osaka Medical College) for tocopherol determination, and Y. Kawase and S. Uchida for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1973967947,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine whose synthesis and secretion are implicated in diverse pathologies. Hence, inhibition of TNF-alpha transcription or translation and neutralization of its protein product represent major pharmaceutical strategies to control inflammation. We have studied the role of ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in controlling TNF-alpha mRNA levels in differentiated THP-1 cells and in freshly purified human monocytes. We show here that it is possible to produce virtually complete inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation by using a combination of ERK and p38 MAP kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, substantial inhibition is achievable using combinations of 1 microm of each inhibitor, whereas inhibitors used individually are incapable of producing complete inhibition even at high concentrations. Finally, addressing mechanisms involved, we show that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase selectively destabilizes TNF-alpha transcripts but does not affect degradation of c-jun transcripts. These results impinge on the controversy in the literature surrounding the mode of action of MAP kinase inhibitors on TNF-alpha mRNA and suggest the use of combinations of MAP kinase inhibitors as an effective anti-inflammatory strategy."

We demonstrate that the effect of the Haemophilus ducreyi CDT (HdCDT) is cell type-specific: B cell lines underwent apoptosis, epithelial cells and keratinocytes arrested exclusively in G2, whereas normal fibroblasts arrested both in G1 and G2. We studied normal keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which are relevant for understanding the pathogenicity ofH. ducreyi. The response to HdCDT resembles the checkpoint response activated by ionizing radiation. Both responses were characterized by an early induction of the p53 gene and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in fibroblasts, and activation of the chk2 kinase in epithelial cells. In the Ataxia Telangiectasia-mutated gene (ATM)-deficient lymphoblastoid cell lines, intoxication was significantly delayed compared with ATM wild type cells, and was associated with a slower kinetic of p53 stabilization, suggesting that the early response to HdCDT is ATM-dependent. Activation of ATM-dependent pathways was further confirmed by the ability of caffeine to partially override the HdCDT-mediated cell cycle arrest.

CDTs are produced by a number of bacterial pathogens, including Escherichia coli,Haemophilus ducreyi, Campylobacter sp.,Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Shigella dysenteriae, and Helicobacter hepaticus. Three linked genes, cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC, encode three polypeptides, which are responsible for the toxic activity. Coexpression of all three components is required to confer toxicity (reviewed in Ref. 1Pickett C.L. Whitehouse C.A. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 292-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), but the functions of the individual gene products are still not known. It was reported that purified cdtB from A. actinomycetemcomitans could induce cell cycle arrest in human T lymphocytes and HeLa cells (2Shenker B.J. McKay T. Datar S. Miller M. Chowhan R. Demuth D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162 (4680): 4773PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shenker B.J. Hoffmaster R.H. McKay T.L. Demuth D.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2612-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, cdtC is absolutely required for the toxin activity in H. ducreyi, because culture supernatant fluid from a bacterial strain carrying a mutated cdtC did not display any cytotoxicity (4Stevens M.K. Latimer J.L. Lumbley S.R. Ward C.H. Cope L.D. Lagergård T. Hansen E.J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3900-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H. ducreyi is a Gram-negative coccobacillus, which causes chancroid, a sexually transmitted disease, characterized by genital tissue necrosis and retardation of healing. The pathogenesis of the disease remains poorly understood. The H. ducreyi CDT (HdCDT) may represent an important virulence factor, because it is produced by the majority of H. ducreyi strains from clinical samples and most patient sera contain HdCDT-neutralizing antibodies, whereas control sera do not (5Purvén M. Falsen E. Lagergård T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 129: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 6Lagergård T. Purvén M. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the production of HdCDT is crucial for cell destruction after adhesion of H. ducreyi to cultured cells, whereas toxin-negative strains adhere but leave the cells intact (7Lagergård T. Purvén M. Frisk A. Microb. Pathog. 1993; 14: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells exposed to CDTs have been shown to arrest in the G2phase of the cell cycle, and this is due to accumulation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdc) 2 (reviewed in Ref. 1Pickett C.L. Whitehouse C.A. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 292-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A similar response is induced in HeLa cells after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) (8Jin P. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In proliferating cells, genotoxic stress activates checkpoint responses, which prevent progression through the cell cycle until the DNA damage has been repaired, thus avoiding genetic instability. Checkpoint arrest occurs at different stages of the cell cycle: the G1/S transition (G1 checkpoint), the S phase progression, and the G2/M boundary (G2/M checkpoint) (9Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar, 10Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). The closely related protein kinases ATM and ATR are key molecules in sensing DNA damage. ATM responds mainly to DNA double stranded-breaks and is inactivated by mutations in ataxia-telangiectasia patients, who are extremely sensitive to IR and other genotoxic agents. ATM can activate all the different checkpoints in response to double stranded-breaks (reviewed in Ref. 11Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6135-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). G1 arrest induced by DNA damage requires the tumor suppressor protein p53, which is stabilized via phosphorylation on serine 20 in an ATM-dependent manner by the chk2 protein kinase (12Siciliano J.D.

Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated p53 dissociates from the Mdm2 protein that otherwise will target p53 for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (15Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar, 16Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar). The G2/M checkpoint involves the maintenance of cdc2 in an inactive hyperphosphorylated state. In the unperturbed cell cycle, cdc2 is kept inactive by phosphorylation on threonine 14 and tyrosine 15 by the wee1 and myt1 kinases. In late G2, the cdc25C phosphatase dephosphorylates these residues, and thereby activates the cdc2·cyclin B1 complex (reviewed in Ref. 17Russell P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 399-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recent data demonstrate that the protein kinases chk1 and chk2 are activated via phosphorylation in vivo in response to DNA damage, and both kinases are able to phosphorylate and inactivate cdc25C in vitro (18Sanchez Y.

Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that HdCDT induces cell growth arrest in a broad panel of human cell types, including normal keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which are the possible toxin targets in vivo. Intoxication of human cells with HdCDT did not exclusively induce G2 arrest, because human foreskin and embryonic lung (HL) fibroblasts were arrested also in G1, and B cells underwent apoptosis. HdCDT induced responses similar to IR in epithelial HEp-2 cells, fibroblasts, and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Furthermore, ATM-deficient LCLs were much more resistant to the intoxication than ATM wild type cells. These data show that HdCDT induces cell cycle arrest by activating checkpoint responses similar to those induced by IR, and that rapid intoxication requires a functional ATM protein kinase. Human foreskin fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (HS27; ATCC, Manassas, VA), and human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HL) were purchased from the Department of Microbiology, Sahlgrenska Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Both lines were used between passages 15 and 25. The Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell line BL41 was established from an Epstein-Barr virus-negative tumor biopsy (20Lenoir G.M. Vuillaume M. Bonnardel C. Lenoir G.M. O'Conor G.T. Olweny C.L.M. Burkitt's Lymphoma: a Human Cancer Model. IARC Scientific Publications, Lyon1985: 309-318Google Scholar). The JAC-B1 and SN-B1 LCLs were obtained by in vitro infection of B lymphocytes from healthy donors with the B95.8 strain of Epstein-Barr virus as previously described (21Miller G. Lipman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 190Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The AT06LA, AT00LA, AT01LA, and AT13LA LCLs established from ataxia-telangiectasia patients were kindly provided by Dr. R. A. Gatti, Department of Pathology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA. Normal keratinocytes, Ad3 and Ad5, were established from human neonatal foreskin and used between passages 3 and 7. The other cell lines were as follows: the human larynx carcinoma HEp-2 (ATCC no. CCL-23), the human cervix carcinoma HeLa (ATCC no. CCL-2), and the human keratinocyte line HaCaT (kindly provided by Dr. N. E. Fusenig, Heidelberg, Germany). All cell lines, except keratinocytes, were cultivated in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 5 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (complete medium) (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Keratinocytes were cultivated in keratinocyte-SFM medium supplemented with bovine pituitary extract (25 μg/ml) and recombinant epidermal growth factor (0.2 ng/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). HdCDT was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the neutralizing monoclonal antibody M4D4, as previously described (22Purvén M. Frisk A. Lönnroth I. Lagergård T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3496-3499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); Western blot analysis with specific antibodies showed that the purified product contained both the B and C components, whereas A was not detectable. The protein concentration of the stock solution was 2 mg/ml. Cells were incubated for the indicated time periods in the presence of HdCDT (2 μg/ml) in complete medium. Cells were irradiated (20 Gy), washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated for the indicated time periods in complete medium. Cells were incubated in complete medium supplemented with 2.5 mm hydroxyurea (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) or 100 nm nocodazole (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) for 24 h. Cells were cooled on ice for 15 min before addition of the toxin (2 μg/ml for 15 min on ice). After the binding step, cells were washed three times with PBS to remove unbound toxin and were further incubated for 24 h in complete medium with or without 4 mm caffeine (Sigma). Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and washed once with PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended and fixed on ice for 15 min with 1 ml of cold ethanol (70%). The cells were subsequently centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of propidium iodide (PI) solution (0.05 mg/ml PI; 0.02 mg/ml RNase; 0.3% Nonidet P-40; 1 mg/ml sodium citrate) for 1 h at 4 °C. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a FACSort flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Data from 104 cells were collected and analyzed using the CellQuest software (Becton & Dickinson). Cells were lysed in 300 μl of SDS electrophoresis sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and samples were boiled for 10 min. The amount of protein in the cell lysates was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Twenty micrograms of total cell lysate was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and probed with the respective antibodies. To detect the electrophoretic mobility shift of the chk2 kinase, 10–20% linear gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used (Bio-Rad). Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden), using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The following antibodies were used: anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); anti-cdc2, anti-Cip1/p21, and anti-Kip1/p27 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); anti-p53 (Ab-6, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA); anti-phosphoserine-15 p53 rabbit serum (kind gift of Dr. Yoichi Taya, University of Japan); anti-chk2 (H-300), anti-cdc25C (C-20), and anti-wee1 (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-chk1 rabbit serum (kindly provided by Dr. Stephen J. Elledge, Verna and Marrs McLean Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). We tested the activity of HdCDT in a broad panel of human cell lines, including two epithelial cell lines, three keratinocyte lines, two normal fibroblast lines, and three lines of B cell origin. As shown in Table I and Fig.1 A, HdCDT induced cell death or cell cycle arrest in all the lines, judged by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry analysis 24 h after toxin treatment. Most of the cell lines tested were arrested exclusively in G2, as detected by accumulation of cells with a 4n DNA content. The HdCDT-induced G2 arrest was not associated with the absence of a functional p53 protein, because cells expressing either wild type or mutated p53 were arrested in G2 (TableI). A different pattern of cell cycle arrest was observed in two normal fibroblast lines derived from foreskin and lung. Intoxicated fibroblasts partially accumulated in G2 24 h after toxin treatment, however, the block in G2 was not complete, and, even 48 h post-intoxication, cells were arrested also in S and G1 (Fig. 1 A). B cell lines showed a 50% decrease of the G1 peak, which was associated with a 2- to 4-fold increase of the apoptotic sub-G1 population 24 h after intoxication. A slight increase in the G2population could be detected only in some experiments (Figs.1 A and 4 A; TableII).Table IHdCDT induces different patterns of cell cycle arrest depending on the cell typeCell lineCell typeG2arrestApoptosis1-aDetection of the sub-G1 population by PI staining 24 h after treatment.cdc2 phosp.1-bAccumulation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of cdc2, detected by Western blot 24 h after treatment.cdc2 decrease1-cDown-regulation of the cdc2 protein detected by Western blot 24 h after treatment.p53 statusHEp-2Epithelial+−+−wtHeLaEpithelial+−+−Non functionalBL411-dBurkitt's lymphoma-derived cell line.B lymphocyte−/++ND1-hND, not done.NDMutatedJAC-B11-eEpstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes derived from healthy donors.B lymphocyte−/++−−wtSN-B11-eEpstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes derived from healthy donors.B lymphocyte−/++−−wtHaCaTKeratinocyte+−+−MutatedAd31-fNormal foreskin keratinocytes.Keratinocyte+−−+wtAd51-fNormal foreskin keratinocytes.Keratinocyte+−−+wtHFS1-gNormal HFS and HL.Fibroblast−/+−−+wtHL1-gNormal HFS and HL.Fibroblast−/+−−+wt1-a Detection of the sub-G1 population by PI staining 24 h after treatment.1-b Accumulation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of cdc2, detected by Western blot 24 h after treatment.1-c Down-regulation of the cdc2 protein detected by Western blot 24 h after treatment.1-d Burkitt's lymphoma-derived cell line.1-e Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes derived from healthy donors.1-f Normal foreskin keratinocytes.1-g Normal HFS and HL.1-h ND, not done.

Open table in a new tab Data are presented as the ratio between the HdCDT-treated cells and the untreated control. It has been previously shown that G2 arrest induced by HdCDT was associated with an accumulation of the hyperphosphorylated form of the cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2 (24Cortes-Bratti X. Chaves-Olarte E. Lagergård T. Thelestam M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Consequently, we assessed whether the different pattern of cell cycle arrest observed in the fibroblasts was associated with a lack of accumulation of hyperphosphorylated cdc2. As shown in Table I and Fig.1 B, accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated cdc2 was detected by Western blot, using anti-cdc2 and anti-phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibodies, only in HEp-2, HeLa, and HaCaT cells 24 h post-intoxication. At this stage, cdc2 was strongly down-regulated in normal keratinocytes and fibroblasts, and no hyperphosphorylation was observed. However, we detected accumulation of hyperphosphorylated cdc2 at early time points after intoxication in a representative line of each cell type (Fig.2, B and C, and data not shown). To test whether HdCDT induced a response similar to other agents known to cause cell cycle arrest, we compared the effect of HdCDT and IR in HEp-2 cells and HL fibroblasts, which showed different patterns of cell cycle arrest. The cell cycle distribution of irradiated cells was similar to that observed upon intoxication in both cell types (Fig. 2 A). The block in G1/S observed in fibroblasts is not an artifact due to the slow proliferation rate of these cells, because we did not detect a complete accumulation in G2 even 48 h post-intoxication (Fig. 1 A) and treatment of cells with nocodazole, known to synchronize cells in mitosis, induced accumulation of the majority of fibroblasts in G2/M already 24 h after treatment (Fig. 2 A). It is noteworthy that both cell types treated with 2.5 mm hydroxyurea, which blocks DNA synthesis by reducing the intracellular levels of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, were arrested in early S phase. Thus, HdCDT and IR induced a similar response, which differed from that caused by hydroxyurea. This issue was further analyzed in time kinetic experiments, where we tested the expression of known regulators of the cell cycle in toxin- and radiation-treated cells. In HL fibroblasts, accumulation of phosphorylated cdc2 was detected only at early time points (4 and 6 h) after intoxication, and an identical response was observed in irradiated cells (Fig.2 B). Increased expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 was observed in both intoxicated and irradiated fibroblasts 4 h post-treatment. This was associated with a strong up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, and to a lesser extent p27, and their levels increased over time. IR-induced activation of p53 is mediated by the ATM kinase, which phosphorylates p53 on serine 15. Using a specific anti-phosphoserine-15 p53 rabbit serum, we showed that this event occurs with a similar kinetic both in intoxicated and irradiated cells 4 h after treatment (Fig.2 C). A different pattern was detected in HEp-2 cells, consistent with the fact that the two cell types behaved differently when exposed to HdCDT or IR (Fig. 2 A). Phosphorylation of cdc2 was observed 4 h after treatment and was maintained up to 24 h, confirming previous data (Table I, Fig. 2 C, and Ref. 24Cortes-Bratti X. Chaves-Olarte E. Lagergård T. Thelestam M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Increased expression of p53 and p21 was detected much later than the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated cdc2. The strongest accumulation of p53 and p21 was observed in HdCDT-treated cells 24 h post-intoxication (Fig. 2 C). IR treatment is known to induce phosphorylation of the chk2 kinase in an ATM-dependent manner, detected as a shift of the chk2-specific band in Western blot analysis (19Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). The chk2 protein was shifted both in intoxicated and irradiated HEp-2 cells 4 h after treatment (Fig. 2 C). We did not detect any relevant change either in the levels of expression or in electrophoretic mobility of other regulatory molecules of the cell cycle, such as chk1, cdc25C, and wee1 (data not shown). Caffeine is known to override the G2/M arrest induced by DNA damage in mammalian cells by indirectly releasing the inhibitory cdc2 phosphorylation (25Poon R.Y. Chau M.S. Yamashita K. Hunter T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5168-5178PubMed Google Scholar, 26Blasina A. Price B.D. Turenne G.A. McGowan C.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1135-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 27Zhou B.-B.S. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10342-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Because we have seen a strong correlation between the responses evoked by HdCDT and IR, we assessed whether caffeine could prevent the HdCDT-induced G2 arrest in HEp-2 cells. Cells were treated with HdCDT for 15 min on ice. After this binding step, cells were washed three times, to remove unbound toxin, and incubated in complete medium supplemented with 4 mm caffeine. The level of cdc2 phosphorylation and cell cycle progression was monitored 24 h post-intoxication by Western blot and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The caffeine treatment completely prevented accumulation of hyperphosphorylated cdc2 (Fig.3 A), and this was associated with partial release of the HdCDT-induced G2 arrest, because 35% of the cells were found in G1 upon caffeine treatment compared with 8% in the untreated cells (Fig.3 B). The ATM protein is a key activator of cell cycle checkpoints in response to DNA-damaging agents (reviewed in Ref. 11Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6135-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent data have shown that caffeine exerts its activity by directly inhibiting the ATM kinase (26Blasina A. Price B.D. Turenne G.A. McGowan C.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1135-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 27Zhou B.-B.S. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10342-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the response to HdCDT in two ATM wild type LCLs and four ATM-deficient cell lines. Cells were exposed to HdCDT for 24 h and subsequently stained with PI, followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Fig.4 and in Table II, a 2- to 4-fold increase of the sub-G1 population was detected in the ATM wild type LCLs. This was associated with a strong decrease of the G1 peak (50% reduction), although no major changes were observed in the S-G2-M population. The ATM-deficient cells were much more resistant to the toxin effect, because we could observe only minor changes in both the sub-G1 and the G1 populations 24 after treatment. It has been previously shown that p53 levels increase with a much faster kinetic in ATM wild type LCLs than in ATM-deficient cells (12Siciliano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). A similar pattern was observed when the control SN-B1 and the ATM-deficient AT13LA lines were exposed to HdCDT (Fig. 5, A and B). A 20-fold increased p53 expression was observed in SN-B1 LCL compared with the 2-fold increase in the AT13LA line 5 h after treatment, and this trend was maintained throughout our experiment. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism(s) by which the cytolethal distending toxin produced by H. ducreyi induces cell cycle arrest and cell death in human cells. The strategy was to investigate the early events occurring in intoxicated cells and compare the effects caused by HdCDT with those induced by ionizing radiation. This is the first report where CDT-intoxicated cells have been analyzed at short time points after toxin exposure, whereas all previous studies have been performed mainly at 24 or 72 h post-intoxication (2Shenker B.J. McKay T. Datar S. Miller M. Chowhan R. Demuth D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162 (4680): 4773PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cortes-Bratti X. Chaves-Olarte E. Lagergård T. Thelestam M. J. Clin.

Bret-Bennis L. Oswald E. Ducommun B. De Rycke J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6296-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have tested a broad panel of human cell types, including normal keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which are conceivable toxin targets in vivo. Our data demonstrate that HdCDT activates a cell cycle checkpoint, which resembles that induced by IR, and highlight a new mechanism of action for bacterial protein toxins. This conclusion is based on three lines of evidence: i) different cell types responded differently to HdCDT (Table I; Figs. 1 A and 2 A), suggesting that HdCDT does not specifically target the G2phase of the cell cycle, as previously suggested (1Pickett C.L. Whitehouse C.A. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 292-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar); ii) similar profiles of cell cycle arrest and time kinetic responses were induced by HdCDT and IR (Fig. 2, A–C); iii) ATM-deficient cells were much more resistant than ATM wild type cells to HdCDT (Fig. 4). We have demonstrated that the response to HdCDT was cell-specific and not exclusively associated with the induction of cell cycle arrest in G2. This observation suggested that HdCDT might target an upstream event that could subsequently activate several downstream pathways leading to cell cycle arrest or cell death. This has prompted us to investigate whether the response of intoxicated cells was similar to any other agent causing activation of checkpoint responses. In normal fibroblasts, both HdCDT and IR induced a rapid stabilization of the tumor suppressor genep53, which was phosphorylated on serine 15, and an increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that the checkpoint response in normal lung fibroblasts is p53-dependent. Functional p53 and p21 proteins are also required to sustain G2 arrest caused by DNA damage (30Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar). However, this is unlikely to occur in HEp-2 cells, because p53 and p21 up-regulation was detected much later than the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated cdc2 (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, cell lines that carried a nonfunctional p53, such as HeLa and HaCaT, still arrested in G2 and did not up-regulate p21, suggesting the involvement of a p53-independent pathway (Table Iand data not shown). In intoxicated HEp-2 cells, we could demonstrate phosphorylation of the chk2 kinase, which plays a major role in the induction of G2 checkpoint responses upon exposure to IR (19Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Activation of chk2 can lead to cdc25C inactivation and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated cdc2. Indeed, inactivation of cdc25C was previously demonstrated in HeLa cells treated with theEscherichia coli CDT (29Sert V. Cans C. Tasca C. Bret-Bennis L. Oswald E. Ducommun B. De Rycke J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6296-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and overexpression of cdc25B and cdc25C could prevent cell intoxication (31Escalas N. Davezac N. De Rycke J. Baldin V. Mazars R. Ducommun B. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Increased expression of phosphoserine-15 p53 in human fibroblasts and phosphorylation of the chk2 kinase in HEp-2 cells strongly suggested that the response to HdCDT was mediated by the ATM kinase. Involvement of ATM for rapid cell intoxication was demonstrated by the delay in intoxication (Fig. 4) and in p53 stabilization (Fig. 5) observed in ATM-deficient cells compared with wild type LCLs. This notion was further supported by the ability of caffeine to alleviate the G2 block imposed by HdCDT in HEp-2 and HeLa cells (Fig. 3,A and B, and Ref. 29Sert V. Cans C. Tasca C. Bret-Bennis L. Oswald E. Ducommun B. De Rycke J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6296-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that caffeine abolishes the G2 block in mammalian cells upon DNA damage by inhibiting the activation of the ATM kinase and consequently blocking the downstream activation of the chk2 protein (26Blasina A. Price B.D. Turenne G.A. McGowan C.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1135-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 27Zhou B.-B.S. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10342-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The delayed intoxication observed in ATM-deficient cells suggests that this protein is required for an early toxin response, but checkpoint responses can still be activated in the absence of functional ATM, probably by homologous molecules. These data indicate that the response to HdCDT is similar to that induced by IR and therefore suggest that the toxin acts either at the level of a central regulator(s) of the cell cycle control machinery or at the level of DNA, activating a checkpoint response in the target cells. Sert and colleagues (29Sert V. Cans C. Tasca C. Bret-Bennis L. Oswald E. Ducommun B. De Rycke J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6296-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) did not detect DNA strand breaks in cells intoxicated with a CDT derived from E. coli, using the single cell gel electrophoresis assay (“comet assay”). However, two recent reports have demonstrated that cdtB from E. coli andCampylobacter jejuni has structural and functional homology to the mammalian type I DNase. DNase activity was associated with the E. coli cdtB, as detected by in vitro digestion of the coiled pGEM-7zf+ plasmid (32Elwell C.A. Dreyfus L.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), whereas marked chromatin disruption was observed in HeLa cells following transfection or microinjection of low amounts of cdtB from C. jejuni(33Lara-Tejero M. Galan J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In both cases, point mutations in conserved residues required for catalysis or magnesium binding abolished the DNase activity and the ability of the toxin to induce cell cycle arrest. It is therefore likely that CDTs induce subtle DNA damage leading to the activation of cell cycle checkpoint responses, in agreement with the data presented in our study. CDTs derived from A. actinomycetemcomitans and H. ducreyi inhibit T cell proliferation and induce apoptotic death in the Jurkat T cell line, respectively (2Shenker B.J. McKay T. Datar S. Miller M. Chowhan R. Demuth D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162 (4680): 4773PubMed Google Scholar, 34Gelfanova V. Hansen E.J. Spinola S.M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6394-6402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have extended these findings demonstrating that also B cell lines are sensitive to HdCDT. Interestingly, among all the cell lines we have tested, the two LCLs and the two Burkitt's lymphoma-derived cell lines BL41 and Rael were very prone to apoptosis upon HdCDT treatment judged by accumulation of a sub-G1population of PI stained cells (Figs. 1 A and 4A, and data not shown). These data, together with the observation that normal keratinocytes and fibroblasts are sensitive to HdCDT, suggest that the toxin contributes to the pathogenesis and immunodeficiency of chancroid by: 1) damaging the epidermal and dermal layers of the genital mucosa and causing retardation in healing; and 2) decreasing and delaying the host immune response by induction of apoptosis in B and T lymphocytes, allowing bacterial replication and enhancing tissue damage. Because CDTs interfere with the cell cycle control machinery, they can offer a possible new tool to intervene in all cases of cell cycle deregulation, tumors being one of the major issues. It is noteworthy that the use of cytotoxic prodrugs has been considered in the field of cancer gene therapy. Attention has been focused on the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase(HSV-tk) gene, which induces single-strand breaks in DNA synthesized in the presence of the nucleoside analogue ganciclovir (35Freeman S.M. Whartenby K.A. Freeman J.L. Abboud C.N. Marrogi A.J. Semin. Oncol. 1996; 23: 31-45PubMed Google Scholar,36Reid R. Mar E.-C. Huang E.-S. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3898-3904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The murine melanoma cell line B16F10 transfected with theHSV-tk gene undergoes irreversible G2/M arrest and cytoskeleton reorganization when treated with ganciclovir (37Halloran P.J. Fenton R.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3855-3865PubMed Google Scholar). HdCDT produces very similar effects in toxin-sensitive tumor cell lines (24Cortes-Bratti X. Chaves-Olarte E. Lagergård T. Thelestam M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and could potentially be used as anti-cancer therapy, if a selective delivery to tumor cells is provided. It is also well established that bacterial toxins have been extremely valuable in dissecting several important aspects of cell biology, such as the role of small GTPases in the control of cytoskeleton rearrangement (reviewed in Ref. 38Thelestam M. Chaves-Olarte E. Moos M. Eichel-Streiber C. Alouf J.E. Freer J. The Comprehensive Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1999: 147-173Google Scholar). The cross-talk between molecules regulating the cytoskeleton and those involved in control of cell cycle progression/arrest is complex and still poorly understood (reviewed in Refs. 39Aspenström P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 40Assoian R.K. Zhu X. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and elucidation of the HdCDT mode of action can be useful to further study this issue. We are grateful to Drs. Richard A.

https://openalex.org/W1990341204,"We report the deduced amino acid sequences of two alternately spliced isoforms, designated DEFCAP-L and -S, that differ in 44 amino acids and encode a novel member of the mammalian Ced-4 family of apoptosis proteins. Similar to the other mammalian Ced-4 proteins (Apaf-1 and Nod1), DEFCAP contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and a putative nucleotide binding domain, signified by a consensus Walker's A box (P-loop) and B box (Mg2+-binding site). Like Nod1, but different from Apaf-1, DEFCAP contains a putative regulatory domain containing multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRR). However, a distinguishing feature of the primary sequence of DEFCAP is that DEFCAP contains at its NH2 terminus a pyrin-like motif and a proline-rich sequence, possibly involved in protein-protein interactions with Src homology domain 3-containing proteins. By using in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments, both long and short isoforms were capable of strongly interacting with caspase-2 and exhibited a weaker interaction with caspase-9. Transient overexpression of full-length DEFCAP-L, but not DEFCAP-S, in breast adenocarcinoma cells MCF7 resulted in significant levels of apoptosis. In vitro death assays with transient overexpression of deletion constructs of both isoforms using β-galactosidase as a reporter gene in MCF7 cells suggest the following: 1) the nucleotide binding domain may act as a negative regulator of the killing activity of DEFCAP; 2) the LRR/CARD represents a putative constitutively active inducer of apoptosis; 3) the killing activity of LRR/CARD is inhibitable by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone and to a lesser extent by Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; and 4) the CARD is critical for killing activity of DEFCAP. These results suggest that DEFCAP is a novel member of the mammalian Ced-4 family of proteins capable of inducing apoptosis, and understanding its regulation may elucidate the complex nature of the mammalian apoptosis-promoting machinery.

Some of the hallmark characteristics of apoptosis include plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear and cytosolic condensation, and ultimately the formation of membrane-bound apoptotic bodies primed for phagocytosis (1Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12725) Google Scholar). Alterations in the ability of the cell to initiate and/or execute the proper apoptotic signaling cascade have been implicated in many diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, viral infections, and neurodegenerative disorders (2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar). Identifying the key mediators of apoptosis and understanding the molecular mechanisms of programmed cell death is critical to understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases.Genetic studies conducted by Horvitz and co-workers (3Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-B Biol. Sci. 1994; 345: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 4Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Development. 1992; 116: 309-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, identified the genesced-3, ced-4, and ced-9 as crucial for initiating proper apoptosis in the developing nematode. Loss of function mutations in Ced-3 and Ced-4 or an overexpression of Ced-9 prevented programmed cell death in the developing nematode. The identification and characterization of these genes led to a wealth of research into the identification of their mammalian counterparts.Based on the analysis of Ced-3 homologous sequences, the cysteine protease interleukin 1β-converting enzyme was identified as the first mammalian Ced-3-like protein, which led to the identification of a family of proteases named caspases (cysteine protease with cleavage specificity after an aspartate residue). Caspases exist in the cell as inactive zymogens or procaspase molecules that with the proper stimuli (e.g. death receptor ligation, DNA damage, and chemotherapeutic agents) can be recruited via their caspase recruitment domain (CARD)1 to form homo- and heterodimers. Following their recruitment, caspases can either autocatalytically or via another caspase become processed into two catalytic subunits and subsequently converted into active enzymes that are capable of initiating the execution arm of the apoptotic signaling pathway. To date, at least 14 members of the caspase family have been identified. Proapoptotic caspases can be classified into two classes based on their primary sequence. Upstream regulatory caspases include caspases-2, -8, -9, and -10 and contain long NH2-terminal prodomains that are important in regulating their recruitment and subcellular localization. Downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 contain short or absent prodomains and upon activation are responsible for the cleavage of many cellular components.To date, only two mammalian Ced-4 homologues, Apaf-1 (5Zou H.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), have been reported. Apaf-1, Nod1, DAPAF-1, and Ced-4 are all similar in having an NH2-terminal CARD followed directly by a nucleotide binding domain (NBD), also known as the NB-ARC or NOD domain. Apaf-1 and Nod1 differ from Ced-4 by having a COOH-terminal regulatory domain containing multiple WD-40 repeats for Apaf-1 and multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRR) for Nod1. After the initiation of an apoptotic stimulus and release of cytochromec from the mitochondria, cytochrome c is believed to bind the WD-40 repeats of Apaf-1 causing a conformational change in Apaf-1. Post-translational modifications (i.e. cytochromec binding) of Apaf-1 can lead to Apaf-1 oligomerization and the subsequent ATP-dependent recruitment, processing, and activation of caspase-9 (5Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar, 10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M.

Apaf-1, caspase-9, and other core components of the apoptosis machinery interact to form an ∼700-kDa biologically active and ∼1.4-MDa biologically inactive complex known as the apoptosome (12Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Formation of the apoptosome and the subsequent processing of caspase-9 have been shown to be crucial for the activation of effector caspases, such as caspase-3, leading to the demise of the cell. In this model, Apaf-1 serves as an adaptor molecule linking upstream regulatory caspases with downstream effector caspases.Nod1, on the other hand, appears to function in activating the NF-κB pathway via an interaction with RICK, a CARD-containing kinase. Furthermore, Inohara et al. (6Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Nunez G. J. Biol.

Nod1/RICK-induced NF-κB activation and Nod1/caspase-9-mediated apoptosis are believed to occur via independent pathways based on the results that an active site caspase-9 mutant was not able to inhibit Nod1-mediated NF-κB activation (13Inohara N.

Named for the ability of CARD to form novel cytoplasmic structures termed death effector filaments (14Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J.

The NH2-terminal region of DEFCAP consists of a pyrin-like motif (PLM), a proline-rich sequence (PR), followed by a highly conserved NBD, a multiple LRR containing domain, and a COOH-terminal CARD. Based on the primary sequence of DEFCAP, which contains a well conserved CARD, NBD, and a putative regulatory domain with multiple LRR motifs, we classify DEFCAP as the third member of the mammalian Ced-4 family of proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSHigh fidelity polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents for cloning were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Full-length DEFCAP-L cDNA was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP, hybridized, and washed according to the protocol described previously (15Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7258) Google Scholar) and exposed to autoradiography film for 5 days. β-Actin cDNA was used as a control for equal loading of RNA. Random primed reverse transcription for semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAs from normal human liver, spleen, polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), K562 and Jurkat cancer cell lines, and a negative control without template were reversed-transcribed. RNAs from K562 and Jurkat cancer cell lines were isolated using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.)and PMN and PBMC RNAs were isolated by a Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gradient, following dextran sedimentation and hypotonic red blood cell lysis. 1 μl of the RT reaction was used for PCR with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CGAGAACAGCTGGTCTTCTCCAGGGCTTCG (antisense) and 5′-TCCCCCTTGGGAGTCCTCCTGAAAATGATC (sense) under the following conditions: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. β-Actin oligonucleotides 5′-CGAGAAGATGACCCAGATCATGTTTGAGAC (sense) and 5′-TGGAAGCAGC CGTGGCCATCTCTTGCTCGA (antisense) were used as a control for RNA integrity and RT efficiency. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under UV light.Chromosomal LocalizationThe Stanford G3 Human/Hamster Radiation Hybrid Panel (Research Genetics) was screened by PCR with the oligonucleotides 5′-CAGCGTCTCCAAGCTCAGCCATTGGGACCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGGCCATGTATTCCATATGCTTCTAGCGT (antisense) yielding an amplified product of ∼300 bp encoding amino acids 560–665. These primers were believed to be restricted to a single exon based on the identification of continuous genomic sequences from PAC pDJ891a18 identified by a nucleotide search of the High Through put Genomic Sequences database.Site-directed MutagenesisAn A box (K340S) point mutation for full-length DEFCAP-L and -S was created using a two-step PCR protocol with the following primer pairs: 5′-CGGGGTACCGCTG GCGGAGCCTGGGGCCGCCTGGCCTGT (sense)/5′-GGCCAGTGTCGACGACCCA ATTCCAGCAGC (antisense) and 5′-GCTGCTGGAATTGGGTCGTCGACACTGGCC (sense)/5′-CAGGCCATGTATTCCATATGCTTCTAGCGT (antisense) followed by PCR amplification with the outside primers, digestion withAhdI/BstXI, and a four-part ligation into pcDNA3.1 NmycH using KpnI, AhdI,BstXI, and NotI restriction sites.Expression VectorsNH2-terminal Myc-tagged DEFCAP expression constructs were made in pcDNA3.1 NmycH usingKpnI/NotI restriction sites for the following: DEFCAP-L (a.a. 1–1473), DEFCAP-S (a.a. 1–1439), K340S-L (a.a. 1–1473), K340S-S (a.a. 1–1439), ΔCARD-L (a.a. 1–1355), ΔCARD-S (a.a. 1–1311), ΔPR-L (a.a. 309–1473), ΔPR-S (a.a. 309–1439), LRR/CARD-L (a.a. 696–1473), LRR/CARD-S (a.a. 696–1439), LRR-L (a.a. 696–1355), LRR-S (a.a. 696–1311), PR/NBD (a.a. 1–648), PR (a.a. 1–308), and DEFCAP-CARD (a.a. 1356–1473).

The NH2-terminal EGFP DEFCAP-CARD (a.a. 1356–1473) fusion construct was made in pEGFPC1-NotI by ligating DEFCAP sequences in frame using 5′ KpnI and 3′ NotI restriction sites. Cells were visualized at × 100 magnification by fluorescence microscopy using a PixCell II microscope (Arcturus).Cell Culture and Transient TransfectionHuman embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in 10% fetal calf serum with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented withl-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and nonessential amino acids. K562 human erythroleukemia cells and MCF7, a human breast carcinoma cell line, were grown in 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and nonessential amino acids. 293 cells were transfected using standard CaPO4−precipitation, and MCF7 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting293 cells were seeded at 10% confluency on 10-cm dishes, grown to 50% confluency, and prior to transfection were given fresh media. A total of 10 μg of DNA was transfected into each dish as stated previously. 6 h post-transfection, the transfected cells were given fresh media, and cells were harvested 12–24 h post-transfection. Cells were harvested by collecting and pooling floating cells with adherent cells on ice and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitors (complete, Mini, BMB 1 836 153) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cell debris was spun down at 20,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. The pellet was washed once with ice-cold PBS, mixed with 25 μl of 1.5× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing dithiothreitol, boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, and saved at −20 °C for Western analysis. The supernatant was precleared with protein G beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The following day, the protein G beads were spun down at 2000 × g, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. 35 μl of precleared supernatant was analyzed for Western analysis, and the remaining supernatant was used for immunoprecipitations conducted with gentle rotation at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody for 3 h. DEFCAP constructs were immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of Myc-AC. Following incubation, the immunoprecipitations were washed 4 times with PBS on ice, resuspended in 1.5× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by Western blotting.Caspase Interaction ExperimentsCoimmunoprecipitation experiments with either full-length NH2-terminal Myc-tagged DEFCAP-L or -S and caspases-2, -3, -8, -9, and -10 were performed in 293 cells. Briefly, 293 cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of Myc-DEFCAP-L or Myc-DEFCAP-S and with 3 μg of caspase construct. 18–24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated with Myc-AC and immunoblotted with caspase specific antibodies. The caspase-2 and caspase-9 coimmunoprecipitation experiments with both DEFCAP isoforms were reproduced in three independent experiments.Cell Death AssaysMCF7 cells were plated on 35-mm 6-well tissue culture dishes, and each well was cotransfected at ∼60% confluency with 0.25 μg of the reporter plasmid pCMV β-galactosidase and 1 μg of either pcDNA3.1 alone or an NH2-terminal Myc-tagged DEFCAP construct. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) for 4 h. The cells were visualized by phase contrast microscopy, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by counting at least 600 blue cells (n ≥ 3). Round blue cells and/or blue cells exhibiting plasma membrane blebbing and cell shrinkage were scored apoptotic. The data presented were from at least two independent experiments conducted in duplicate or triplicate. A Student's t test using the computer program SigmaStat (Jandel) comparing vector control with various DEFCAP constructs was performed to obtain p values. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is the genetically determined cell suicide program resulting in distinct biochemical and morphological features. Some of the hallmark characteristics of apoptosis include plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear and cytosolic condensation, and ultimately the formation of membrane-bound apoptotic bodies primed for phagocytosis (1Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12725) Google Scholar). Alterations in the ability of the cell to initiate and/or execute the proper apoptotic signaling cascade have been implicated in many diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, viral infections, and neurodegenerative disorders (2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar). Identifying the key mediators of apoptosis and understanding the molecular mechanisms of programmed cell death is critical to understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases. Genetic studies conducted by Horvitz and co-workers (3Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-B Biol. Sci. 1994; 345: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 4Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Development. 1992; 116: 309-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, identified the genesced-3, ced-4, and ced-9 as crucial for initiating proper apoptosis in the developing nematode. Loss of function mutations in Ced-3 and Ced-4 or an overexpression of Ced-9 prevented programmed cell death in the developing nematode. The identification and characterization of these genes led to a wealth of research into the identification of their mammalian counterparts. Based on the analysis of Ced-3 homologous sequences, the cysteine protease interleukin 1β-converting enzyme was identified as the first mammalian Ced-3-like protein, which led to the identification of a family of proteases named caspases (cysteine protease with cleavage specificity after an aspartate residue). Caspases exist in the cell as inactive zymogens or procaspase molecules that with the proper stimuli (e.g. death receptor ligation, DNA damage, and chemotherapeutic agents) can be recruited via their caspase recruitment domain (CARD)1 to form homo- and heterodimers. Following their recruitment, caspases can either autocatalytically or via another caspase become processed into two catalytic subunits and subsequently converted into active enzymes that are capable of initiating the execution arm of the apoptotic signaling pathway. To date, at least 14 members of the caspase family have been identified. Proapoptotic caspases can be classified into two classes based on their primary sequence. Upstream regulatory caspases include caspases-2, -8, -9, and -10 and contain long NH2-terminal prodomains that are important in regulating their recruitment and subcellular localization. Downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 contain short or absent prodomains and upon activation are responsible for the cleavage of many cellular components. To date, only two mammalian Ced-4 homologues, Apaf-1 (5Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), have been reported. Apaf-1, Nod1, DAPAF-1, and Ced-4 are all similar in having an NH2-terminal CARD followed directly by a nucleotide binding domain (NBD), also known as the NB-ARC or NOD domain. Apaf-1 and Nod1 differ from Ced-4 by having a COOH-terminal regulatory domain containing multiple WD-40 repeats for Apaf-1 and multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRR) for Nod1. After the initiation of an apoptotic stimulus and release of cytochromec from the mitochondria, cytochrome c is believed to bind the WD-40 repeats of Apaf-1 causing a conformational change in Apaf-1. Post-translational modifications (i.e. cytochromec binding) of Apaf-1 can lead to Apaf-1 oligomerization and the subsequent ATP-dependent recruitment, processing, and activation of caspase-9 (5Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar, 10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Apaf-1, caspase-9, and other core components of the apoptosis machinery interact to form an ∼700-kDa biologically active and ∼1.4-MDa biologically inactive complex known as the apoptosome (12Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Formation of the apoptosome and the subsequent processing of caspase-9 have been shown to be crucial for the activation of effector caspases, such as caspase-3, leading to the demise of the cell. In this model, Apaf-1 serves as an adaptor molecule linking upstream regulatory caspases with downstream effector caspases. Nod1, on the other hand, appears to function in activating the NF-κB pathway via an interaction with RICK, a CARD-containing kinase. Furthermore, Inohara et al. (6Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) demonstrate that Nod1 is capable of interacting with caspase-9 and enhancing caspase-9-mediated apoptosis. Nod1/RICK-induced NF-κB activation and Nod1/caspase-9-mediated apoptosis are believed to occur via independent pathways based on the results that an active site caspase-9 mutant was not able to inhibit Nod1-mediated NF-κB activation (13Inohara N.

Here we report the deduced amino acid sequences and characterization of DEFCAP-L and DEFCAP-S (Death Effector Filament-forming Ced-4-likeApoptosis Protein), two isoforms for a novel member of the mammalian Ced-4 family of proteins. Named for the ability of CARD to form novel cytoplasmic structures termed death effector filaments (14Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J.

Sulfolipid biosynthesis involves the transfer of sulfoquinovose, a 6-deoxy-6-sulfoglucose, from UDP-sulfoquinovose to diacylglycerol. The formation of the sulfonic acid precursor, UDP-sulfoquinovose, from UDP-glucose and a sulfur donor is proposed to be catalyzed by the bacterial SQDB proteins or the orthologous plant SQD1 proteins. To investigate the underlying enzymatic mechanism and to elucidate thede novo synthesis of sulfonic acids in biological systems, we developed an in vitro assay for the recombinant SQD1 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana. Among different possible sulfur donors tested, sulfite led to the formation of UDP-sulfoquinovose in the presence of UDP-glucose and SQD1. An SQD1 T145A mutant showed greatly reduced activity. The UDP-sulfoquinovose formed in this assay was identified by co-chromatography with standards and served as substrate for the sulfolipid synthase associated with spinach chloroplast membranes. Approximate K m values of 150 μm for UDP-glucose and 10 μm for sulfite were established for SQD1.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 53-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Harwood J.L. Stumpf P.K. The Biosynthesis of Plants. Academic Press, Inc., New York1980: 301-320Google Scholar). The head group of SQDG is sulfoquinovose, an anionic sulfonic acid derivative of glucose (6-deoxy-6-sulfoglucose). Therefore, SQDG contributes a negative charge to the thylakoid membrane along with the other major anionic thylakoid lipid phosphatidylglycerol. Sulfolipid-deficient bacterial mutants are impaired in growth following phosphate deprivation (3Benning C. Beatty J.T. Prince R.C. Somerville C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on this result and other evidence, it was proposed that SQDG is essential to maintain a balance of thylakoid membrane charge by substituting for phosphatidylglycerol under phosphate limiting conditions (1Benning C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 53-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the reactions of sulfolipid biosynthesis by biochemical means has been recalcitrant in the past, but recently powerful new experimental tools became available with the isolation of sulfolipid-deficient mutants of the purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides and the cloning of the first genes encoding enzymes of sulfolipid biosynthesis, sqdA, sqdB,sqdC, and sqdD (5Benning C. Somerville C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6479-6487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Benning C. Somerville C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2352-2360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rossak M. Schäfer A. Xu N. Gage D.A. Benning C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The sulfonic acid precursor giving rise to the sulfolipid head group was originally postulated by A. A. Benson to be UDP-sulfoquinovose (UDP-SQ) (8Benson A.A. Adv. Lipid Res. 1963; 1: 387-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and synthetic UDP-SQ was later shown to specifically stimulate sulfolipid biosynthesis in isolated chloroplast membranes (9Heinz E. Schmidt H. Hoch M. Jung K.H. Binder H. Schmidt R.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Seifert U. Heinz E. Bot. Acta. 1992; 105: 197-205Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Only recently, the existence of UDP-SQ in living cells has been demonstrated using a sulfolipid-deficient mutant of R. sphaeroides that accumulates UDP-SQ (11Rossak M. Tietje C. Heinz E. Benning C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25792-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Subsequently, UDP-SQ was discovered also in other photosynthetic organisms (12Tietje C. Heinz E. Planta. 1998; 206: 72-78Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Indirect clues toward the elucidation of sulfolipid biosynthesis could be deduced from the sequences of putative sqd gene products. In particular, the SQDB protein of R. sphaeroides has sequence similarity to sugar nucleotide-modifying enzymes, and orthologous proteins in bacteria and plants are highly conserved (13Weissenmayer B. Geiger O. Benning C. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 666-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It was suggested that these proteins catalyze a reaction between UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) and a suitable sulfur donor leading to the formation of UDP-SQ (5Benning C. Somerville C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6479-6487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pugh C.E. Roy A.B. Hawkes T. Harwood J.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The SQD1 protein of Arabidopsis thaliana is an orthologue of the bacterial SQDB proteins (15Essigmann B. Güler S. Narang R.A. Linke D. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1950-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and its crystal structure has been elucidated (16Mulichak A.M. Theisen M.J. Essigmann B. Benning C. Garavito R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13097-13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recombinant SQD1 lacking the chloroplast transit peptide has a mass of 45.5 kDa, forms a dimer, and contains a buried active site with tightly bound NAD+ (16Mulichak A.M. Theisen M.J. Essigmann B.

Biophys. 1999; 369: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Co-crystallization with UDP-Glc demonstrated directly the binding of this presumed substrate in the active site. Furthermore, in place of the sulfur donor, water molecules were present. Labeled sulfate is incorporated into SQDG by isolated chloroplasts (18Haas R. Siebertz H.P. Wrage K. Heinz E. Planta. 1980; 148: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Joyard J. Blee E. Douce R. Biochim. Biophys.

Biophys. 1985; 240: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and it seemed likely that the sulfur donor is derived from the sulfate reduction pathway in the chloroplast. Intermediates of this pathway, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) and 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), were indeed incorporated into SQDG by isolated chloroplasts (21Kleppinger-Sparace K.F. Mudd J.B. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Another intermediate of the sulfate reduction pathway, sulfite, has not been tested in this system but was shown to be incorporated into SQDG by extracts of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (22Hoppe W.

Here, we provide evidence for the SQD1-catalyzed formation of the sulfolipid head group donor UDP-SQ from UDP-Glc and sulfite in vitro. The following sulfur-containing substrates were used: sulfate (J. T. Baker Inc.), sulfite (Merck), sulfide (Sigma), APS (Sigma), PAPS (Sigma), glutathione (reduced and oxidized forms) (Sigma), and thiosulfate (Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, St. Louis, MO). Sulfoglutathione was synthesized according to Ref. 23Eriksson B. Rundfelt M. Acta Chem. Scand. 1968; 22: 562-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and purified by TLC and visualized as described (24Eriksson B. Eriksson S.A. Acta Chem. Scand. 1967; 21: 1304-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled UDP-[14C(U)]glucose and UDP-[14C(U)]galactose were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Labeled UDP-[35S]sulfoquinovose was prepared using thesqdD mutant of R. sphaeroides and analyzed by TLC as described (11Rossak M. Tietje C. Heinz E. Benning C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25792-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Labeled [35S]APS was prepared from [35S]PAPS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by phosphatase treatment (25Bick J.A. Aslund F. Chen Y. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8404-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified below, common buffer ingredients were obtained from general commercial sources. RecombinantA. thaliana SQD1 protein excluding the transit peptide was purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described by Essigmann et al. (15Essigmann B. Güler S. Narang R.A. Linke D. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1950-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The column was eluted with 200 mm imidazole, which was subsequently removed by use of a Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA) Ultrafree 4 concentrator. The SQD1 protein was stored in 20% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, and 25 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.5) at −20 °C. Basic activity assays were carried out at 37 °C in a buffer containing 10 μg of SQD1, 100 μm Na2SO3, 500 μm UDP-[14C(U)]glucose (89 Bq nmol−1), and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) in a total volume of 100 μl for 40 min unless otherwise stated. For some experiments, as indicated, we increased the UDP-Glc concentration to 1.6 mm to fully saturate (10 ×K m) the enzyme with this substrate. The coupled APS reductase/SQD1 assay contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm[35S]APS (500 Bq nmol−1), 250 mm Na2SO4, 1 mm EDTA, 500 μm UDP-Glc, 66 μg of SQD1, and 12 μg of APR1 fromA. thaliana (25Bick J.A. Aslund F. Chen Y. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8404-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. In all cases, samples were heat-denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and analyzed by HPLC (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) employing a Beckman (Fullerton, CA) Ultrasphere ODS column (4.6 mm × 25 cm; particle size 5 μm) kept constantly at 42 °C. Substrates and products were separated by applying a linear gradient of 30 mmKH2PO4, 2 mm tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (Fisher), adjusted to pH 6.0 with KOH, to HPLC grade acetonitrile (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min over 45 min. The column was allowed to re-equilibrate for 17 min (acetonitrile to phosphate buffer) after each run. Labeled compounds were detected using a β-Ram model 2 Flow Through Monitor (INUS Systems, Tampa, FL). Chloroplasts were isolated from spinach (locally available produce) according to Rossak et al. (11Rossak M. Tietje C. Heinz E. Benning C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25792-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll was quantified by the method of Lichtenthaler (26Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (9425) Google Scholar). The assay consisted of 35 μg of chlorophyll with 10,000 dpm of radioactive compound U2 in 50 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tricine/KOH, 30 mmMgCl2, pH 7.5). For control purposes, galactolipid synthesis was monitored using UDP-[14C(U)]galactose (0.4 μm, 1200 Bq nmol−1) as substrate. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Assays were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of chloroform/methanol/formic acid (1:1:0.1, v/v/v) and 50 μl of 1m KOH, 0.2 m phosphoric acid. Samples were mixed and centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 × g. Lipids in the lower chloroform phase were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on ammonium sulfate-impregnated plates by the method of Benning and Somerville (6Benning C. Somerville C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2352-2360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the substitution of toluene for benzene in the mobile phase. Autoradiography was used to visualize labeled sulfolipid. An SQD1 mutant derivative was constructed by PCR mutagenesis employing a method of Ito et al. (27Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Threonine 145 was changed to alanine using the primers 5′-ATACTCACCCATCGCCCCAAGTTTTAC-3′ and 5′-ATCACCATCACGGCTCCCGTGTTAT-3′. PCR products were cloned into pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and mutant plasmids were sequenced at the MSU sequencing facility. The mutant open reading frame was inserted into pQE30 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), expressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein was purified as described (15Essigmann B. Güler S. Narang R.A. Linke D. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1950-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). An enzyme assay was developed to measure the conversion of UDP-Glc to UDP-SQ as predicted for SQD1 activity. SQD1 protein was estimated to be at least 95% pure by gel analysis (Fig.1). To broadly analyze the reaction mixtures for substrates and reaction products, we employed an HPLC system optimized for the separation of sugar nucleotides. Sample through-put was limited, in particular because columns had to be regenerated extensively after few runs. Therefore, we also explored different TLC systems and filter-based assays to separate substrates and products with the goal of processing large sample numbers in parallel. However, none of the alternative procedures we designed, thus far, were satisfactory with regard to sample recovery or reproducibility. Because of the limitation in sample through-put, data points shown are representative for at least three different independent experiments instead of averages of multiple repeats in a single experiment. We routinely used labeled UDP-Glc as tracer for the radioassay. Incubation of the SQD1 protein with labeled UDP-Glc in a simple Tris buffer, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” resulted in the formation of two compounds with unique retention times as compared with UDP-Glc (Fig. 2,A and B). At the end of the assay period, the protein was routinely denatured to release any products or intermediates still bound in the active site of the protein. Filtration of the reaction mixture using Amicon filters (M rcut-off 10,000; Millipore) without denaturation revealed that 77% of compound U2 (Fig. 2 B) was free in solution as compared with 35% of compound U1 (average of three samples). Adding sulfite to the reaction mixture eliminated compound U1 completely and stimulated the formation of compound U2 (Fig. 2 C). The relative amounts of compounds U1 and U2 were variable in assays to which no sulfite was added, depending on the SQD1 protein preparation. This effect may have been caused by varying amounts of contaminating compounds carried over from the E. coli extract in SQD1 preparations, a hypothesis that was not further investigated.Figure 2Conversion of UDP-Glc by SQD1. The chromatographic analysis of 14C-labeled substrate and reaction products by HPLC is shown (A–C). Shown are UDP-Glc without SQD1 protein (A), UDP-Glc and SQD1 protein (B), UDP-Glc, SQD1 protein, and sulfite (C), and authentic 35S-labeled UDP-SQ isolated from thesqdD mutant of R. sphaeroides (D). U1 and U2 are products as described under “Results.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Until this time, it has not been possible to identify compound U1. Because of the lack of suitable standards, a de novo structural elucidation would have been required for which we could not obtain sufficient amounts of material. However, compound U2co-chromatographed in the HPLC system with authentic UDP-SQ isolated from the sqdD mutant of R. sphaeroides (Fig. 2,C and D), indicating that this compound may be the proposed intermediate of sulfolipid biosynthesis, UDP-SQ. To obtain corroborating evidence, labeled compound U2 purified by HPLC was analyzed by TLC together with extracts from [35S]sulfate-labeled R. sphaeroides wild type and sqdD mutant cells. The latter are known to accumulate UDP-SQ (11Rossak M. Tietje C. Heinz E. Benning C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25792-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Compound U2 co-chromatographed with UDP-SQ also in this system (data not shown). The sulfolipid synthase of spinach chloroplast envelopes is highly discriminatory toward UDP-SQ (9Heinz E. Schmidt H. Hoch M. Jung K.H. Binder H. Schmidt R.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Seifert U. Heinz E. Bot. Acta. 1992; 105: 197-205Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the substrate specificity of this enzyme and incubated compound U2 with spinach chloroplast membranes and observed the formation of a 35S-labeled compound co-chromatographing with sulfolipid (Fig. 3). Taken together, these three independent lines of evidence identified compound U2 as UDP-SQ. Thus far, the greatest mystery in the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway for sulfolipid biosynthesis has been the nature of the sulfur donor for the formation of UDP-SQ. The establishment of the SQD1 in vitro assay described above gave us the opportunity to directly address this problem. It seemed most likely that a metabolite or its derivative of the sulfur assimilation pathway in bacteria and plants (sulfate, APS, PAPS, sulfite, thiosulfate, sulfide, or sulfoglutathione) would provide the sulfonic acid group in the formation of UDP-SQ. We therefore tested these compounds unlabeled at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 mm in the UDP-Glc-based SQD1 assay to determine whether they could stimulate the formation of UDP-SQ. The addition of sulfate, APS, and PAPS had no affect on the absolute amounts or ratios of the reaction products. The addition of 0.1 mm thiosulfate, sulfide, and sulfoglutathione resulted in a decrease in the relative amount of compound U1 and an increase in the amount of compound U2 as shown for sulfite in Fig. 1 C. We assumed that in all three instances, this effect was due to sulfite, which was either produced by chemical reaction from thiosulfate, sulfide, or sulfoglutathione in aqueous solution or was already present in the respective compound preparations as contaminant. To corroborate this hypothesis, it was necessary to directly test the incorporation of labeled sulfite into UDP-SQ. Because labeled sulfite was not commercially available and because it is fairly reactive in solution (28Hayon E. Treinin A. Wilf J. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 47-57Crossref Scopus (713) Google Scholar), we decided to synthesize sulfite directly in the assay mixture from [35S]APS and dithiothreitol as reductant using recombinant APS reductase 1 from A. thaliana (APR1) (25Bick J.A. Aslund F. Chen Y. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8404-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The second SQD1 substrate, UDP-Glc, was provided unlabeled. Incubating APS, dithiothreitol, UDP-Glc, and APR1 alone followed by HPLC analysis of the reaction products resulted in the conversion of APS to sulfite (Fig. 4, A andB). When SQD1 was present in the APR1 reaction mixture, sulfite was converted to compound U2 previously identified as UDP-SQ (Fig. 4, C and D). The formation of UDP-SQ from labeled APS in this APR1/SQD1 coupled assay was further confirmed using the spinach sulfolipid synthase assay described above (data not shown). Incubating labeled APS with SQD1 alone did not lead to the formation of labeled UDP-SQ (result not shown, but essentially indistinguishable from Fig. 4 A). Sulfite had been previously suggested as a substrate for sulfolipid synthesis using extracts of C. reinhardtii (22Hoppe W. Schwenn J.D. Z. Naturforsch. 1981; 36c: 820-826Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, sulfite incorporation was not saturable as expected for enzyme-catalyzed reactions in this system. To rule out a nonenzymatic reaction of sulfite as the cause for the observed UDP-SQ formation and to demonstrate directly that SQD1 activity is required in the in vitro assay system described above, we constructed a point mutant of SQD1 (T145A) by exchanging threonine 145 with alanine (for gel, see Fig. 1 C). From the crystal structure of the SQD1·UDP-Glc complex, it was obvious that threonine 145 coordinates a water along with the C-4 and C-6 hydroxyl groups of the glucose moiety of UDP-Glc in a high energy conformation (16Mulichak A.M. Theisen M.J. Essigmann B. Benning C. Garavito R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13097-13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was predicted that threonine 145 plays a critical role for catalytic activity. Indeed, when the T145A mutant was incubated for 40 min in the presence of sulfite and labeled UDP-Glc, no product was formed in comparison with the wild type reaction (Fig.5, A and B). Only after 46 h of incubation, a very small product peak was visible in the mutant sample (Fig. 5 C). This result suggested that the activity of the mutant enzyme is reduced by several orders or magnitude, thereby confirming that SQD1 enzymatic activity is essential for the observed conversion of UDP-Glc and sulfite to UDP-SQ. Basic enzymatic properties of SQD1 were determined using the standard assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Enzyme activity was linear from 5 to 50 μg of SQD1 protein as tested (Fig.6 A). The reaction was also linear with respect to the assay time of up to 60 min (data not shown). The optimal pH for activity was between 7.5 and 9.5 (Fig.6 B). Subsequently, all standard assays were performed at pH 7.5 with 10 μg of protein for 40 min. To determine the kinetic constants for UDP-Glc, increasing amounts of this substrate were added at a concentration of 100 μm sulfite (Fig.6 C). The reaction was saturable, and the Michaelis-Menten constant, K m, for UDP-Glc was estimated to be 150 μm, the specific activity 2.6 nmol of UDP-SQ min−1 mg−1 protein, and the turnover number, kcat , 0.1 min−1. To examine the specificity of the enzyme, we added equal amounts of ADP-Glc and UDP-Glc (500 μm each) with UDP-Glc as the labeled tracer. However, no inhibition of the reaction by ADP-Glc was observed (data not shown). Because SQD1 normally contains NAD+ in its binding site, this nucleotide was added to the reaction, but it did not affect product formation (data not shown). Keeping the UDP-Glc concentration at 1.6 mm and varying the concentration of sulfite (Fig. 6 D), the reaction was saturable, with aVmax similar to that observed for UDP-Glc. However, the K m for sulfite was ∼10 μm, an order of magnitude lower as compared with UDP-Glc. Increasing the sulfite concentration beyond 100 μminhibited the reaction (Table I). This effect was specific to sulfite, because other salts as shown in Table Idid not inhibit the reaction.Table ISQD1 assay with excess sulfite and added saltAdded saltConcentrationSQD1 activitymmpmol min−1No salt16.9 ± 2.0Na2SO316.6 ± 1.7Na2SO3103.8 ± 0.2Na2SO410021.5 ± 1.9NaH2PO410027.3 ± 0.7NaCl10021.6 ± 1.5Mean values ± S.D. are shown (n = 5).

All assays contained 0.1 mm Na2SO3, 1.6 mmUDP-Glc, and 13 μg of SQD1 protein but were otherwise conducted under standard conditions. Unlike sulfonic acids such as taurine, which represent oxidation products of sulfur amino acids in animals, the sulfolipid head group donor UDP-SQ (11Rossak M. Tietje C. Heinz E. Benning C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25792-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is synthesized de novo in bacteria and plants. Studying the recombinant protein SQD1 of A. thaliana, we could observe the enzyme-catalyzed formation of UDP-SQ in vitro. Although no direct structural elucidation of the reaction product was feasible, three independent lines of indirect evidence confirmed the identity of the product as UDP-SQ: first, co-chromatography with authentic UDP-SQ by HPLC; second, co-chromatography by TLC; and third, conversion of the product by spinach SQDG synthase to sulfolipid. The formation of UDP-SQ was dependent on the presence of UDP-Glc and sulfite. Based on this result, we propose a tentative model of sulfolipid biosynthesis with UDP-Glc and sulfite as the precursors as shown in Fig.7. Sulfolipid biosynthesis is a function of chloroplasts (18Haas R. Siebertz H.P. Wrage K. Heinz E. Planta. 1980; 148: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Joyard J. Blee E. Douce R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 879: 78-87Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Kleppinger-Sparace K.F. Mudd B. Bishop D.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and SQD1 has previously been shown to be imported into the plastid (15Essigmann B. Güler S. Narang R.A. Linke D. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1950-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This poses a theoretical problem, because it is unclear whether the precursor UDP-Glc is actually available in the plastid, and, at least, one would have to assume that its concentration is very low compared with ADP-Glc (29Bligny R. Gardestrom P. Roby C. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1319-1326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, ADP-Glc, which is involved in photosynthetic starch biosynthesis in plastids, was not a substrate for the reaction. Furthermore, UDP-Glc provided a perfect fit within the active site based on the crystal structure of SQD1 (16Mulichak A.M. Theisen M.J. Essigmann B. Benning C. Garavito R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13097-13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulate that UDP-Glc is present in the plastid in sufficient amounts to support sulfolipid biosynthesis. Whether UDP-Glc is imported from the cytosol as indicated in Fig. 7 or generated inside the plastid remains unclear. Of all of the possible sulfur donors tested, none was more active than sulfite. Compounds that could spontaneously give rise to sulfite in aqueous solution, such as thiosulfate and sulfoglutathione, did stimulate the activity of the enzyme to the same extent as sulfite directly. It is still debated whether APS-reductase generates sulfite directly or first generates sulfoglutathione, which subsequently hydrolyzes to release sulfite (30Hell R. Planta. 1997; 202: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 31Leustek T. Saito K. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Therefore, the question arises of whether sulfoglutathione may be a precursor for UDP-SQ biosynthesis in vivo. Two arguments speak against this hypothesis: first, glutathione could not be modeled into the structure of SQD1 in a catalytically sensible way; second, sulfoglutathione was not more effective in stimulating UDP-SQ biosynthesis than sulfite itself. Therefore, we propose that sulfite derived from the APS reductase reaction is the precursor for UDP-SQ biosynthesis in vivo. The APS-reductase is part of the sulfur assimilation machinery in the chloroplast. At least three isoforms exist (32Bick J.A. Leustek T. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and it seems possible that SQD1 directly and specifically interacts with one of these. Sulfite is a reactive and cytotoxic compound (e.g. Refs.33Tuazon P.T. Johnson S.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 34Shimazaki K. Nakamachi K. Kondo N. Sugahara K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1984; 25: 337-341Google Scholar, 35Lizada M.C.C. Yang S.F. Lipids. 1981; 16: 189-194Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and substrate channeling between one of the APS reductase isoforms and SQD1 would allow sulfolipid biosynthesis without build-up of sulfite as an intermediate. The K m of ∼10 μm for sulfite is relatively low in accordance with a high affinity of SQD1 for the substrate. Interestingly, concentrations above 100 μm sulfite inhibit the reaction. Whether this inhibition reflects a biologically meaningful regulatory process or a toxic effect on the protein due to reactive radicals derived from sulfite oxidation (28Hayon E. Treinin A. Wilf J. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 47-57Crossref Scopus (713) Google Scholar) requires further investigation. Contrary to experiments with extracts of C. reinhardtii (22Hoppe W. Schwenn J.D. Z. Naturforsch. 1981; 36c: 820-826Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the formation of UDP-SQ from sulfite and UDP-Glc was saturable with increasing amounts of sulfite as would be expected for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The reaction depended on the presence of SQD1 enzyme, and evidence for the crucial role of SQD1 in the formation was derived from the T145A mutant of SQD1, which was virtually inactive while retaining a native structure. 2M. J. Theisen, S. Sanda, C. Benning, and R. M. Garavito, manuscript in preparation. Although clearly measurable, the reaction of the wild-type protein is already very slow, with 0.1 turnovers/min. It seems unlikely that the activity of SQD1 is this low in vivo because it would presumably not suffice to produce enough sulfolipid during rapid leaf growth. Assuming that UDP-Glc and sulfite are the correct substrates, at least three explanations can be found for the low in vitro activity of SQD1. First, the recombinant enzyme has been truncated at the N terminus to remove the predicted transit peptide (15Essigmann B. Güler S. Narang R.A. Linke D. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1950-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The prediction of the cleavage site may be incorrect, and the truncation may have affected activity. However, the bacterial SQDB proteins are similar in size as compared with the recombinant SQD1 protein and seem to work properly in vivo. Second, an allosteric factor is missing that would normally activate the enzyme in vivo. Third, SQD1 is part of a larger protein complex and requires, thus, direct and proper contact with an APS reductase and possibly other enzymes. At this time, we cannot distinguish between these possibilities. Another unusual feature of SQD1 activity is that it shows a broad pH optimum, between 7.5 and 9.5. One possibility for the high activity close to pH 7.5 is that it arises from the change in protonation state of Tyr182 and/or His183. The amino acid Tyr182 is thought to initiate catalysis by abstracting a proton from the 4′-hydroxyl group of UDP-Glc. A homologous residue in the structurally related enzyme UDP-galactose 4′-epimerase, Tyr149, has an estimated pK a of 6.08 (36Liu Y. Thoden J.B. Kim J. Berger E. Gulick A.M. Ruzicka F.J. Holden H.M. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10675-10684Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). If Tyr182 of SQD1 had a similar pK a, SQD1 would lose activity as the pH decreased. Moreover, His 183 is considered to be the general base in the dehydration step that requires the removal of the C-5′ proton from glucose (16Mulichak A.M. Theisen M.J. Essigmann B. Benning C. Garavito R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13097-13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Unless perturbed by the local environment, His183 should have a pK a of ∼7. The origin of the high activity close to pH 9.5 remains an enigma. In summary, we have shown that recombinant SQD1 of A. thaliana catalyzes the formation of UDP-SQ, the sulfolipid head group donor and one of the few biological sulfonic acids, in vitro from UDP-Glc and sulfite. The reaction showed all features expected for an enzymatic reaction. However, the turnover rate was very low and further analysis will be required to demonstrate that SQD1 catalyzes the proposed reaction also in vivo. We thank J. F.

Thus, under conditions associated with palmitate turnover and βγ dissociation, αq-GFP remains associated with the plasma membrane.

Science. 2000; 287: 1034-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, an important player in this pathway, the G protein α subunit, has not yet been visualized in this way, presumably because the importance of both the amino and carboxyl termini for localization and function has precluded the fusion of GFP to these sites. Understanding the mechanism by which α subunit localization is regulated requires tools such as GFP-tagged α subunits that allow real-time visualization of α subunits in living cells. Studies using conventional procedures such as cell fractionation and immunohistochemistry provide only a limited view of the process, are subject to artifacts, and have yielded conflicting results. G protein α subunits are peripheral membrane proteins that attach to the plasma membrane as a result of amino-terminal myristoylation and/or palmitoylation, and association with the βγ subunits. Whereas myristoylation occurs co-translationally and is stable throughout the lifetime of the α subunit, palmitate is added post-translationally and turns over upon stimulation by activated receptors (6Wedegaertner P.B.

Members of the αi family (αi1, αi2, αi3, αo, αz, and αt) are myristoylated and all except αt are also palmitoylated. αq and αs are palmitoylated, but not myristoylated. However, the existence of additional membrane-targetting signals associated with the amino termini of αq and αs has been proposed (11Hepler J.R. Biddlecome G.H. Kleuss C. Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L.

A. 1997; 94: 6116-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For αq and αs, the roles of palmitoylation and association with βγ in regulating localization are controversial. Mutations of the palmitoylation sites have been reported either to cause these α subunits to partition exclusively in the soluble rather than the particulate fraction (13Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H.

Mutation of αq residues important for βγ interaction has been reported to decrease palmitoylation and disrupt association with the plasma membrane (17Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but mutational activation of αs, which should decrease association with βγ, has been reported to be associated with both decreased (6Wedegaertner P.B.

Varying effects of receptor-mediated activation on the localization of αq and αs have been observed. β-Adrenergic receptor stimulation has been reported to cause αs to move from the particulate to the soluble fraction (18Wedegaertner P.B.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, in other studies, β-adrenergic receptor-dependent relocation of αs was not observed (19Huang C. Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Jones T.L. Degtyarev M.Y. Backlund Jr., P.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7185-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thyrotropin-releasing hormone induced patching of α11 has been reported to occur within 10–60 min of hormone exposure, followed by internalization within 2–4 h, time scales that are slow compared with that of the activation cycle (22Drmota T. Novotny J. Kim G.D. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Svoboda P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21699-21707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). αq/11 has also been reported to transiently translocate to the plasma membrane of adrenal glomerulosa cells in response to stimulation by angiotensin II for 1–5 min (23Cote M. Payet M.D. Dufour M.N. Guillon G. Gallo-Payet N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3299-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To elucidate the factors responsible for targeting of αqto the plasma membrane and to determine whether the cellular localization of αq changes during the activation cycle, we have followed αq localization in vivo under basal and activated conditions using a functional αq-GFP fusion protein in which GFP is inserted into an internal loop of αq. The effects of mutational activation on targeting of αq-GFP have been tested by substituting cysteine for Arg183 of αq, which inhibits GTPase activity (24Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also tested the effects of mutating the αqpalmitoylation sites, Cys9 and Cys10 (13Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on αq-GFP localization. To determine whether membrane-associated αq-GFP relocalizes upon activation, the effects of stimulation by hormone-activated receptors or AlF4− have been tested. Our results indicate that although the basal activation state and palmitoylation are important for initially targeting αq-GFP to the plasma membrane, activation of membrane-associated αq-GFP, which is thought to cause palmitate turnover and dissociation from βγ, does not cause relocalization. These results suggest that upon reaching the plasma membrane αqreceives an anchoring signal in addition to palmitoylation and association with βγ, or that during activation, one or both of these factors continues to retain αq in this location. αq-GFP was generated from murine αq (25Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and “humanized” GFP with the S65T mutation (26Zolotukhin S. Potter M. Hauswirth W.W. Guy J. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4646-4654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using polymerase chain reactions that produced DNA fragments with overlapping ends that were combined subsequently in a fusion polymerase chain reaction (27Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). GFP was inserted in between αqresidues 124 and 125. A 6-residue linker sequence (SGGGGS) was inserted at both of the junctions between αq and GFP using oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Muta-Gene kit. αqRC-GFP and αq-C9S/C10S-GFP were generated from αq-GFP using oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis. All αq and αq-GFP constructs contain an epitope, referred to as the EE epitope (29Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) that was generated by mutating αq residues SYLPTQ (171) to EYMPTE. PKCγ-RFP was produced by replacing a Kpn I/Not I fragment encoding eGFP in pPKCγ-EGFP (CLONTECH) with a Kpn I/Not I fragment encoding RFP (CLONTECH). For expression in Xenopus oocytes, αq and αq-GFP were subcloned asNot I fragments into pGEM-HE (30Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Subcloning and mutagenesis procedures were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. HEK-293 cells (ATCC, CRL-1573) (12.5 × 106 per 150-mm dish) were transfected with 37.5 μg of plasmid using DEAE-dextran (31Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R. E., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Smith, J. A., Seidman, J. G., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1987) in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed by 10 passages through a 27-gauge needle in 0.5 ml of an ice-cold buffer containing 50 mmTris (pH 8.0), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Nuclei were pelleted (750 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and the postnuclear supernatant was then fractionated (18,000 ×g, 30 min, 4 °C) into membrane pellets and supernatants. The pellets were washed once and resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer. Membrane proteins were quantified using the Lowry assay (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (10 μg of membrane proteins and normalized volumes of the supernatant fractions) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (10%), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the anti-EE monoclonal antibody as described (33Medina R. Grishina G. Meloni E.G. Muth T.R. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24720-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody according to the ECL Western blotting protocol. Recombinant α subunits were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells using DEAE-dextran (31Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R. E., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Smith, J. A., Seidman, J. G., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1987) in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). 106 cells per 60-mm dish were transfected with 1 μg of vector containing the porcine α2a-adrenergic receptor (34Guyer C.A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 17307-17317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and varying amounts of vector alone or vector containing an α subunit construct as indicated in the figure legends. 24 h after transfection, the cells were replated in 24-well plates and labeled with [3H]inositol (5 μCi/ml for 24 h). The assay for intracellular inositol phosphates was performed as described (33Medina R. Grishina G. Meloni E.G. Muth T.R. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24720-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A human homolog of GIRK4, referred to as GIRK4*, in which threonine is substituted for Ser143, was used as described previously (35He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmids expressing GIRK4*, αq, or αq-GFP were linearized with Nhel and cRNAs were transcribed in vitro using the “message machine” kit (Ambion). RNAs were electrophoresed on formaldehyde gels and concentrations were estimated from two dilutions using RNA marker (Life Technologies, Inc.) as a standard. Xenopus oocytes were surgically extracted, dissociated, and defolliculated by collagenase treatment, and microinjected with 50 nl of a water solution containing 1 ng of the desired cRNA. Oocytes were incubated for 3 days at 19 °C. Whole oocyte currents were then measured by conventional two-microelectrode voltage clamp with a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments). Agarose-cushion microelectrodes were used with resistance between 0.1 and 1.0 MΩ. Oocytes were constantly superfused with a high potassium solution having (in mm): 91 KCl, 1 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, and 5 KOH/HEPES (pH 7.4). To block currents, the oocyte chamber was perfused with solutions of the same composition with 3 mmBaCl2. Typically oocytes were held at 0 mV (EK) and currents were constantly monitored by 500-ms pulses to a command potential of −80 mV for 200 ms followed by a step to +80 mV for another 200 ms and the cycle was repeated every 2 s. Current amplitudes were measured at the end of the 200-ms pulse at each potential. 0.5 × 106 HEK-293 cells were plated onto 35-mm tissue culture dishes containing a glass coverslip (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Life Technologies). Cells were imaged 48–72 h after transfection. The cells were imaged using an inverted Zeiss microscope or a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC600). The inverted microscope was fitted with computer controlled (IPLabs, Scanalytics) filter wheels (Ludl electronics) on the excitation and emission paths to sequentially image the GFP and RFP signals (excitation and emission filters from HQ fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red filter sets, dichroic mirror from fluorescein isothiocyanate/Texas Red Pinkel filter set; Chroma, Brattelboro, VT). For the confocal microscopy, factory supplied fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red excitation/emission optics were used to image the GFP and RFP signals separately. The pixel densities across the membrane were fit with IGOR software (Wavemetrics, Oswego, OR). The cells were fixed in ice-cold, PBS-buffered paraformaldehyde. The cells were subsequently rinsed with PBS, and then incubated with 10% normal goat serum in PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 30 min. The primary antibodies (a rabbit anti-GFP antibody from CLONTECH, a rabbit anti-peptide antibody to a COOH-terminal sequence of αq/α11 from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, or a rabbit anti-peptide antibody to an internal sequence of αq/α11 corresponding to residues 277–294 of αq from Sigma) were diluted with PBS and 10% normal goat serum with 0.05% Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1:1000, 1:250, or 1:250, respectively, and added for an overnight incubation. The following day, the cells were washed with three changes of PBS, incubated for 60 min in a 1:500 dilution of a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and then washed three times in PBS. All experiments involved examining plates processed in parallel that were not exposed to the primary antibody. The signal to noise in each experiment was determined by comparing the signals produced in the presence and absence of the primary antibody. To produce a functional αq-GFP fusion protein, GFP was inserted in between αq residues 124 and 125 in the αB/αC loop of the helical domain (Fig. 1). The rationale for this fusion strategy was that the helical domain of αq does not specify activation of PLC (33Medina R. Grishina G. Meloni E.G. Muth T.R. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24720-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the insertion site corresponds to a region in GPA1, a G protein α subunit in Saccharomyces cerevisae, in which there is an insertion of ∼100 residues relative to other α subunits (36Dietzel C. Kurjan J. Cell. 1987; 50: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 37Miyajima I. Nakafuku M. Nakayama N. Brenner C. Miyajima A. Kaibuchi K. Arai K.I. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Cell. 1987; 50: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This design avoided modifying the amino or carboxyl termini of αq, which are important for interaction with receptors, PLC, and βγ, and for membrane attachment (11Hepler J.R. Biddlecome G.H. Kleuss C. Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 496-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 38Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). A 6-residue linker sequence (Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser) was placed at each of the junctions between αq and GFP. To enable comparison of the expression levels of αq and αq-GFP, both constructs contain an epitope, referred to as the EE-epitope (29Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), located in the αE/αF loop of the helical domain. This epitope does not interfere with receptor-mediated stimulation of PLC by αq (39Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9667-9675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cell fractionation and immunoblotting with an anti-EE monoclonal antibody showed that αq and αq-GFP were expressed in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells at similar levels and exhibited similar distribution patterns (Fig.2). In addition to associating with the membrane pellet, both αq and αq-GFP were isolated in the cytoplasmic fractions. To investigate whether the activation state of αq affects targeting to the plasma membrane, GFP was inserted into αqRC, in which substitution of cysteine for Arg183 causes constitutive activation of αq by reducing its GTPase activity (24Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For both αq and αq-GFP, the RC mutation caused a minor increase in the relative amount of protein that fractionated in the supernatant compared with the amount in the membrane pellet. To test the role of palmitoylation in membrane targeting, GFP was also inserted into αq-C9S/C10S, in which serines were substituted for the αq palmitoylation sites (13Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C9S/C10S mutations also increased the relative amount of both αq and αq-GFP in the supernatant. The effect of the C9S/C10S mutations was more pronounced than that of the RC mutation, but neither αq-C9S/C10S nor αq-C9S/C10S-GFP was completely soluble. αq-GFP and αq exhibited indistinguishable abilities to stimulate PLC in response to stimulation by the α2a-adrenergic receptor in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells (Fig. 3). Although these cells express αq endogenously, inositol phosphate production in response to stimulation with the α2-adrenergic agonist, UK-14,304, was minimal in cells that were transfected solely with plasmid encoding the α2a-adrenergic receptor. Co-transfection of these cells with plasmid encoding either αq or αq-GFP resulted in agonist-dependent increases in inositol phosphate production. The relationship between the magnitude of the response and the amount of transfected plasmid was the same for the αq- and αq-GFP-expressing plasmids. Thus, the ability of αq to interact with receptors and effectors is not impaired by the GFP insertion. As for αq, the RC mutation caused constitutive activation of αq-GFP (Fig. 4). Stimulation of cells co-transfected with plasmid encoding the α2a-adrenergic receptor and plasmid encoding either αqRC or αqRC-GFP with UK-14,304 resulted in further elevation of inositol phosphate levels, indicating that the RC mutation inhibits, but does not abolish GTP hydrolysis. In contrast to αq-GFP, which stimulated PLC to the same extent as αq did (Figs. 3 and 4), αqRC-GFP was less effective at PLC stimulation than αqRC was. Since the RC mutation has been reported to destabilize αs (20Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), it is possible that combining this mutation with the insertion of GFP results in decreased stability of αqRC-GFP compared with that of αq-GFP or αqRC. αq-GFP and αq also exhibited identical abilities to interact with βγ, as demonstrated by inhibition of βγ-dependent activity of the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel, GIRK4 (Fig.5). Agonist-independent (basal) potassium currents through GIRK4 homotetrameric channels expressed inXenopus oocytes can be inhibited by coexpression of αi subunits (35He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 40Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Since GIRK channels bind to and are activated by only the βγ subunits of G proteins (41Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 42Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), this inhibition serves as a functional assay of α subunit binding to βγ subunits. Coexpression of αq displayed the same inhibitory effect on βγ-stimulated basal GIRK4 currents. Coexpression of αq-GFP with GIRK4 channels reduced K+ currents to the same extent as αq did, indicating that GFP-tagged αq can bind to βγ and prevent βγ-mediated activation of the channel as efficiently as αq can. Imaging of transiently expressed αq-GFP in live HEK-293 cells with confocal microscopy demonstrated signal in the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm (Fig.6 A). In some cells there were distinct patches of αq-GFP in the plasma membrane. There was some variability in the ratio of signal at the membrane compared with that in the cytoplasm, but there was no correlation with the level of expression. Bright cells had the same variability as did the dim ones. Imaging of αqRC-GFP-expressing HEK-293 cells (Fig.6 B) demonstrated a significantly higher ratio of cytoplasmic to plasma membrane signal than in αq-GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 6 A). As with αq-GFP, there was expression level independent cell-to-cell variability in the localization pattern. The C9S/C10S mutations had a more dramatic effect on localization than the RC mutation in that they completely eliminated detectable plasma membrane labeling by αq-GFP (Fig.6 C). These results suggest that targeting of αq-GFP to the plasma membrane requires both association with βγ, which would be impaired by the RC mutation, and palmitoylation of Cys9 and Cys10. To more clearly visualize the plasma membrane-associated populations of the αq-GFP constructs, we treated cells expressing these constructs with 1% Triton X-100 to extract the soluble proteins. Surprisingly, although αqRC-GFP and αq-C9S/C10S-GFP exhibited quite similar distribution patterns in living cells (Fig. 6), treatment of cells expressing one or the other of these constructs with 1% Triton X-100 produced very different results. Treatment of αqRC-GFP-expressing HEK-293 cells (Fig. 7 C) with 1% Triton X-100 revealed a signal in the plasma membrane (Fig.7 D) that was similar to that seen in Triton-treated αq-GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 7 B). Therefore, although the RC mutation decreases the percentage of αq-GFP that is associated with the plasma membrane, there is residual αqRC-GFP signal at this location that is masked in living cells because it is of similar intensity to the cytoplasmic signal. However, in contrast to the results obtained with cells expressing αq-GFP or αqRC-GFP, after treatment of αq-C9S/C10S-GFP-expressing cells (Fig.7 E) with 1% Triton X-100, no staining of the plasma membrane was seen (Fig. 7 F). Thus, Cys9 and Cys10, the αq palmitoylation sites, are essential for plasma membrane association. In previous immunohistochemistry studies, αq was found either predominantly in the plasma membrane (22Drmota T. Novotny J. Kim G.D. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Svoboda P. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), or associated with the cytoskeleton (23Cote M. Payet M.D. Dufour M.N. Guillon G. Gallo-Payet N.

Reasoning that preparation of specimens for immunohistochemistry might affect the apparent localization pattern of αq and therefore contribute to these diverse observations, we investigated whether the αq-GFP signal was altered during fixation and immunostaining (Fig. 8).

A mutation at nucleotide position 8993 of human mitochondrial DNA, located within the gene for ATP synthase subunit 6, is associated with the neurological muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) syndrome. To enable analysis of this mutation in control nuclear backgrounds, two different cell lines were transformed with mitochondria carrying NARP mutant mitochondrial DNA. Transformant cell lines had decreased ATP synthesis capacity, and many also had abnormally high levels of two ATP synthase sub-complexes, one of which was F1-ATPase. A combination of metabolic labeling and immunoblotting experiments indicated that assembly of ATP synthase was slowed and that the assembled holoenzyme was unstable in cells carrying NARP mutant mitochondrial DNA compared with control cells. These findings indicate that altered assembly and stability of ATP synthase are underlying molecular defects associated with the NARP mutation in subunit 6 of ATP synthase, yet intrinsic enzyme activity is also compromised.

It is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotic cells together with four respiratory chain enzymes that generate the proton motive force, which in turn drives ATP synthesis. ATP synthase comprises a rotary catalytic portion, F1-ATPase, whose structure has been solved (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar), a transmembrane portion F0, and two stalks that link F1 and F0. Two of the subunits of the F0 portion of ATP synthase, subunits 6 and 8 (or subunit a and A6L), are encoded in mitochondrial DNA in all animal cells. Specific inhibition of mitochondrial translation (including subunits 6 and 8) by drug treatment leads to accumulation of two ATP synthase assembly intermediates and a concomitant decrease in holoenzyme in human cultured cells (2Nijtmans L.G. Klement P. Houstek J.,. van den Bogert C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1272: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One of the earliest disease-associated point mutations of mtDNA1 to be described was localized to ATP synthase subunit 6 gene, hereafter called A6 (3Holt I.J. Harding A.E. Petty R.K. Morgan-Hughes J.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 428-433PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation, a thymine to guanine transversion at nucleotide position 8993 of human mtDNA, hereafter termed T8993G, predicts substitution of a highly conserved leucine by arginine at amino acid position 156. The mutation was found in a family presenting with neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa, a syndrome termed NARP. There was good correlation between mutant load and disease severity (3Holt I.J. Harding A.E. Petty R.K. Morgan-Hughes J.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 428-433PubMed Google Scholar). This was further documented when it was shown that very high levels of T8993G mutant mtDNA were associated with a severe neurodegenerative disease of childhood (maternally inherited Leigh syndrome, or MILS) (4Tatuch Y. Christodoulou J. Feigenbaum A. Clarke J.T. Wherret J. Smith C. Rudd N. Petrova-Benedict R. Robinson B.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 852-858PubMed Google Scholar). The T8993G mtDNA mutation is found in ∼15% of patients with a mitochondrial disorder whose disease has been clearly linked to a point mutation in mtDNA. 2M. Zeviani, personal communication. 2M. Zeviani, personal communication.Considered collectively, mitochondrial disorders are among the commonest neurological diseases; therefore the mutation is of considerable clinical importance. In the current structural model of mitochondrial ATP synthase, the enzyme represents a rotary motor (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar). A6 forms part of one of the stators, and subunit c forms the rotor (5Elston T. Wang H. Oster G. Nature. 1998; 391: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The T8993G mtDNA mutation predicts an arginine for leucine substitution in the fourth helix of A6, a region that is believed to interact with subunit c. A second point mutation at nucleotide position 8993 changes leucine to proline and is associated with a similar phenotype in patients (6de Vries D.D. van Engelen B.G. Gabreels F.J. Ruitenbeek W. van Oost B.A. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 34: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that any amino acid substitution in this region that induces a conformational change will perturb holoenzyme activity, assembly, or stability. The T8993G mtDNA mutation did not appear to alter ATP hydrolysis activity (4Tatuch Y. Christodoulou J. Feigenbaum A. Clarke J.T. Wherret J. Smith C. Rudd N. Petrova-Benedict R. Robinson B.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 852-858PubMed Google Scholar) but did decrease ATP synthesis in digitonin-permeabilized cells (7Tatuch Y. Robinson B.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Wallace and co-workers (8Trounce I. Neill S. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8334-8338Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) use 143B osteosarcoma cells that lack mtDNA (ρo cells) as recipients of mitochondria carrying T8993G mtDNA. They found that mitochondria with T8993G mtDNA, isolated from this control nuclear background, had reduced state III respiration, indicative of decreased ATP synthase activity. In another study, muscle mitochondria harboring T8993G mtDNA were shown to contain sub-complexes of ATP synthase, raising the possibility that the underlying defect in this disease was holoenzyme assembly or stability (9Houstek J. Klement P. Hermanska J. Houstkova H. Hansikova H. Van den Bogert C. Zeman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate for the first time that mutant subunit A6 of ATP synthase is linked to impaired assembly of complex V in human cells. The standard cell culture medium in this study was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 110 mg/liter pyruvate, with 10% fetal bovine serum. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The osteosarcoma 143B TK− cells and cybrids were supplemented with 100 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine. The ρo cells derived from the osteosarcoma 143B cell line (143B.206) and the lung carcinoma cell line (A549.B2) were in addition supplemented with 50 μg/ml uridine. The absence of mtDNA from both these cell lines has been shown previously by Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction (10King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, 11Bodnar A.G. Cooper J.M. Holt I.J. Leonard J.V. Schapira A.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 663-669PubMed Google Scholar). Enucleation of cells was achieved by inverting 35-mm tissue culture plates, 70–90% confluent, in 95% DMEM, 5% fetal bovine serum with 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B (Calbiochem) and centrifuging at 7,000 × g for 20 min. The resultant cytoplast lawn was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with ∼8 × 105ρo cells. The addition of 50% w/v polyethylene glycol 1500, 45% DMEM, 5% Me2SO induced cell-cytoplast fusion. After 1 min, the cells were washed twice in 90% DMEM, 10% Me2SO and three times in DMEM alone and incubated overnight in 90% DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum without uridine. Putative transformant cells were re-plated on 90-mm dishes in 90% DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum without uridine. Individual colonies were picked ∼14 days later using glass rings. Cytoplast-ρocell fusion was performed between NARP fetal fibroblasts after enucleation and osteosarcoma or lung carcinoma ρo cells. Transformant osteosarcoma cybrids carrying mtDNA molecules derived from NARP fetal fibroblasts were designated 206.8993. Equivalent lung carcinoma cybrids were denoted B2.8993. In addition, cybrids carrying mtDNA from a control subject were generated by the same protocol and designated 206.con (osteosarcoma cybrids) or B2.con (lung carcinoma cybrids). Blue native electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) and second dimension SDS-PAGE were performed using the method of Schagger and Von Jagow (13Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) and Schagger et al. (14Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial samples were prepared by incubating 5 × 106 cells in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 2 mg/ml digitonin for 10 min on ice. The solution was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C, and the resultant crude mitochondrial pellet was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, re-centrifuged, and stored at −70 °C. Immediately before electrophoresis, the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 1.5 m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, with 20 μl of 10%n-dodecyl maltoside and incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was mixed with 10 μl of 5% Serva Blue G in 1m 6-aminohexanoic acid, and equal amounts of protein, as determined by the Bradford method (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), were added to each lane of a 5–13% gradient gel. Pulse-chase experiments were performed as described previously. (16Nijtmans L.G. Barth P.G. Lincke C.R. Van Galen M.J. Zwart R. Klement P. Bolhuis P.A. Ruitenbeek W. Wanders R.J. Van den Bogert C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1270: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells in DMEM without methionine (ICN) were incubated with [35S]methionine at a final concentration of 20 μCi/ml. After chase times of 0, 1, 3, 6, and 18, h cells were harvested and used to prepare crude mitochondrial fractions (17Nijtmans L.G. Taanman J.W. Muijsers A.O. Speijer D. Van den Bogert C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) for two-dimensional BN-PAGE. The gels were fixed, treated with AmplifyTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the protocol of the manufacturer, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 1–24 h at −70 °C. Alternatively, in some instances labeled protein was transferred to Hybond-C membrane and exposed to x-ray film, as for the dried gels, after which the membrane was blocked and immunoblotted with antibody to subunits of F1-ATPase. A Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI was used to quantify the relative amounts of each complex. The rate of ATP synthesis in cybrids was determined using the method of (18Wanders R.J. Ruiter J.P. Wijburg F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in incubation buffer including 20 μg/ml digitonin. Permeabilized cells were incubated with succinate (5 mm) and rotenone (4 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of perchloric acid. After incubation on ice for 2 min, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 2 min, and the supernatants were neutralized with 2m KOH, 0.6 m MOPS. The samples were re-centrifuged, and 1–5-μl aliquots of the final supernatant combined with 50 μl of ATP monitoring reagent (Bio-Orbit, Turku, Finland). The amount of light detected in a luminometer was converted to moles of ATP with reference to ATP standards after deducting the signal obtained from the corresponding ρo cells (osteosarcoma or lung carcinoma). Thus, the values obtained reflect ATP synthesis activity that was specific to oxidative phosphorylation (OP). Histochemical staining of ATP hydrolysis activity in blue native polyacrylamide gels was performed according to Zerbetto et al. (19Zerbetto E. Vergani L. Dabbeni-Sala F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Growth rates were assessed either by direct counting of trypsinized cells on a Neubauer counting chamber or using a tetrazolium salt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) that acts as a vital dye. (20Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45064) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in DMEM with 4.5 g/liter glucose or DMEM with 0.9 g/liter galactose substituted for glucose. Intact cell oxygen consumption rates were determined in a Clark-type oxygen electrode from 500–1000 μl of 5 × 106cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium without glucose (Life Technologies). Oxygen consumption rates were expressed as fmol of O2/min/cell. The addition of carbonyl cyanidep-chlorophenylhydrazone or carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone during an experiment led to an increase in the rate of oxygen consumption in all cells tested (data not shown), indicating that the assay was measuring coupled respiration. DNA extraction, amplification, electrophoresis, blotting, and hybridization were as described (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). For quantification of the level of mutant mtDNA, DNA was extracted from ∼5 × 106 cells and digested with AvaI, and the restriction fragments were separated on 1% agarose gels. After Southern blotting, filters were probed with total purified human mtDNA. Mitochondrial translation products were labeled specifically by incubating 106 cells with 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30–60 min in the presence of 10 μg/ml emetine, as described previously (21Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2236-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Mitochondria carrying NARP mutant mtDNA were transferred from human fetal fibroblasts to lung carcinoma or osteosarcoma cells that lacked endogenous mtDNA by cell-cytoplast fusion. The donor mitochondria from fetal fibroblasts contained exclusively mutant (T8993G) mtDNA, and sequencing of the genes encoding ATP synthase subunits 8 and 6 revealed no other novel mutations (data not shown). Mitochondrial transformant cells (cybrids) were selected by their ability to grow in the absence of uridine, in contrast to ρo cells, which are auxotrophic for uridine (10King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Screening of transformant cell lines for the presence of mutant mtDNA revealed that all cybrids examined contained exclusively T8993G mutant mtDNA (data not shown). Immunoblotting of BN-PAGE and two-dimensional BN-PAGE/SDS-PAGE (Figs.1 and 2, respectively) with F1-ATPase antibody revealed an abnormal amount of sub-complexes of mitochondrial ATP synthase in some lung carcinoma NARP cybrids and all osteosarcoma NARP cybrids examined. These sub-complexes are F1-ATPase and a sub-complex, denoted V*, which contains F1-ATPase and an unknown number of copies of subunit c (2Nijtmans L.G. Klement P. Houstek J.,. van den Bogert C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1272: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,9Houstek J. Klement P. Hermanska J. Houstkova H. Hansikova H. Van den Bogert C. Zeman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Sub-complex V* was present in ρo cells (Fig. 1,lane 8, and Fig. 2, lane 4) and must therefore lack subunits A6 and A8, which are encoded in mtDNA. V* is also known to lack subunit b of F0F1-ATPase (9Houstek J. Klement P. Hermanska J. Houstkova H. Hansikova H. Van den Bogert C. Zeman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Free F1-ATPase has been described previously in ρo cells (23Buchet K. Godinot C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22983-22989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and is known to accumulate together with V* in cells where mitochondrial translation has been inhibited (2Nijtmans L.G. Klement P. Houstek J.,. van den Bogert C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1272: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a sub-complex of ATP synthase has been crystallized recently that comprises F1-ATPase and a ring of 10 copies of subunit c (22Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar); however, it is not known if this ATP synthase derivative and V* are equivalent. All the NARP cybrid cell lines contained at least some fully assembled complex V (Figs. 1 and2). As the cybrids were homoplasmic for the T8993G NARP mutation, the complex V holoenzyme in these cells must contain mutant subunit 6.Figure 2ATP synthase appeared structurally normal in some lung carcinoma NARP cybrids, whereas complex V sub-complexes were always present in osteosarcoma NARP cybrids. Each panelis a mitochondrial membrane sample separated in the first dimension by BN-PAGE (left to right) and subsequently in a second dimension 12% denaturing SDS-PAG (top to bottom). Protein was transferred to solid support and immunoblotted with the same F1-ATPase antibodies used in Fig. 1.

Panel 4, mitochondria derived from 206 ρo osteosarcoma cells.Panels 5–8, four lung carcinoma NARP cybrids, two of which appeared structurally normal (panels 7 and 8), whereas two displayed abnormally high levels of F1-ATPase and V* (panels 5 and 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Re-cloning a NARP lung carcinoma cybrid gave rise to sub-clones with an identical pattern of sub-complexes to the parental cell line (Fig. 1), suggesting that the population of cells was homogenous. That is, the result argues against the idea that some cells contained high levels of sub-complexes, whereas others contained exclusively holoenzyme. Sub-complexes of complex V were present at very low levels or undetectable in three of five NARP lung carcinoma cybrids (clones A, D, and E), two of which are shown in Fig. 2. Where no sub-complexes of complex V were detected, the total amount of complex V holoenzyme was similar in NARP cybrids and control cells, suggesting that there was no significant alteration in the amount of complex V in NARP cybrids. The interclonal variability, in the amount of complex V sub-complexes, among the B2.8993 cybrids may reflect differences in the nuclear gene composition or activity (involving, e.g. assembly factors, chaperones, or nuclear-encoded subunits) among lung carcinoma ρ0 cells. Such nuclear heterogeneity has been observed previously for osteosarcoma ρ0 cells (24Chomyn A. Lai S.T. Shakeley R. Bresolin N. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 54: 966-974PubMed Google Scholar). There was some experiment-to-experiment variation in the amount of sub-complexes for a given clone. The extent of the variation is shown in Fig. 3 for osteosarcoma clone 206.8993 A. Note that the relative amounts of all three complexes, complex V holoenzyme, V*, and F1-ATPase, varied not merely the ratio of holoenzyme to sub-complexes. The most common result is shown in Fig. 3, panel 1, where the proportions of holoenzyme, V*, and free F1-ATPase were 75, 12, and 13%, respectively. In the most extreme case, free F1-ATPase accounted for approximately half the total H+-ATPase (47%), whereas ATP synthase holoenzyme represented only 37% of the total (Fig. 3,panel 3). No such variation was observed in control cells, where holoenzyme always accounted for at least 95% of H+-ATPase. These results indicate either that the phenotype fluctuates over time in NARP cybrids or, more likely, that mutant containing complex V is less stable than wild-type ATP synthase. All the NARP cybrid cell lines remained homoplasmic mutant throughout the course of the study. Both the interclonal variability among the lung carcinoma NARP cybrids and the sensitivity to the conditions of isolation and sample preparation of the holoenzyme from the same NARP cybrid point to the critical role of leucine 156 in the assembly and stability of the ATP synthase complex. As a further test of the possible effects of the T8993G mutation, [35S]methionine pulse-chase experiments were performed followed by two-dimensional BN-PAGE of labeled proteins. ATP synthase, F1-ATPase, and V* were distinguishable (Fig.4), and their relative representation could be deduced by comparing the labeling of α and β subunits of F1-ATPase, since these subunits are constituents of all three complexes. First, lung carcinoma NARP cybrids A and D were analyzed, as these did not give appreciable amounts of steady-state sub-complexes. After a 1-h chase, labeled sub-complexes were detected in lung carcinoma NARP cybrid cells, whereas these were largely absent from control cells. In particular, V* was detectable in lung carcinoma NARP cybrids, whereas labeled V* was not seen in control cells (Fig.4 A, panels 1–3). V* was not detectable by immunoblotting in any of the mitochondrial preparations from these lung carcinoma NARP cybrids or controls (Fig. 4 B), a finding that established the labeled V* and F1-ATPase as assembly, rather than breakdown, intermediates. We conclude that the transition from V* sub-complex to ATP synthase holoenzyme is impeded in cells carrying mutant A6. In cells that had been incubated for 3–18 h after removal of [35S]methionine, almost all the labeled α and β subunits were incorporated into fully assembled complex V in both controls and lung carcinoma NARP cybrids (Fig. 4 A,panels 4–6, and data not shown). A similar assessment of osteosarcoma NARP cybrids also revealed differences between immunoblotting and metabolic labeling analyses. After chases of up to 3 h, the ratio of sub-complexes to holoenzyme was higher for newly synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled complexes (66:34) than for the steady-state level (30:70) determined by blotting with F1-ATPase antibody (Fig. 5,A and B). Thus, although all the newly synthesized (radiolabeled) α and β subunits had been incorporated into ATP synthase holoenzyme in control cells after 3 h, one-third remained as sub-complexes in osteosarcoma cybrids carrying NARP mutant mtDNA. After an 18-h chase, the ratio was similar by both methods in osteosarcoma NARP cybrid and the control cells (Fig. 5, Aand B). These findings indicate that the assembly defect was common to both nuclear backgrounds, yet was more marked in the osteosarcoma than the lung carcinoma background given that labeled sub-complexes, which could not be ascribed to disassembly, were detected after a 3-h chase only in the former cell type. Measurement of ATP synthesis in digitonin-permeabilized cells indicated a decrease of approximately one-third in lung carcinoma NARP cybrids compared with the parental control cell line (Fig.6). As stated above, some of the cybrids analyzed (B2.8993A and -D) contained few if any sub-complexes on BN-PAGE analysis, like the control cells. Therefore, the ATP synthesis capacity of holoenzyme containing mutant A6 must itself be impaired. The ATP synthesis capacity of osteosarcoma NARP cybrids was approximately half that of control cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that the mutation may be more deleterious in the osteosarcoma nuclear background than that of A549 lung carcinoma cells. The F1-ATPase inhibitory protein (IF1) is believed to regulate ATP synthase (25Klein G. Satre M. Dianoux A.C. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2919-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Penin F. Di Pietro A. Godinot C. Gautheron D.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8969-8974Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); therefore, we tested whether there was a discernible difference between the amounts of IF1 in control, NARP, or ρo cells. No significant difference was observed (Fig.7). IF1 was found to be associated with sub-complexes of ATP synthase as well as with the holoenzyme (Fig. 7). Nevertheless F1-ATPase consistently displayed higher in-gel ATP hydrolysis activity than holoenzyme (Fig.8), suggesting that subunits of the F0 portion of ATP synthase restrict ATP hydrolysis.Figure 8In-gel assay of ATP hydrolysis revealed higher activity for free F1-ATPase than ATP synthase holoenzyme. Equivalent amounts of mitochondrial membrane protein were separated as in Fig. 1. After BN-PAGE, ATP hydrolysis activity was measured in-gel according to the protocol of (19Zerbetto E. Vergani L. Dabbeni-Sala F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Lane 1, parental osteosarcoma cells; lane 2, an osteosarcoma NARP cybrid; lane 3, osteosarcoma ρo cells. The signal from F1-ATPase (lane 3) was severalfold higher than that from holoenzyme (lane 1). The absence of signal from the NARP cybrid holoenzyme implies a complete loss of ATP hydrolysis activity; however, this is misleading, as there was a sharp threshold effect for the in-gel assay, i.e. loading half the amount of control protein led to complete loss of signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although assays of holoenzyme integrity and the permeabilized cell assay clearly indicated defects of complex V, the T8993G mtDNA mutation had no appreciable phenotypic effect upon intact lung carcinoma or osteosarcoma cybrids. Specifically, there was no significant decrease in oxygen consumption of coupled intact cells carrying T8993G mtDNA compared with controls (Fig. 9). Nor was there any significant increase in lactate-to-pyruvate ratio in spent medium (data not shown). The growth rate of NARP and control cybrids over periods of 7–9 days were indistinguishable, even in medium where galactose was substituted for glucose (data not shown). In contrast, ρo cells and cells with high levels of “A3243G” mutant mtDNA died in galactose medium. 3N. Hance and I. J. Holt, unpublished data. There was no measurable effect on mitochondrial translation in osteosarcoma cell cybrids with or without T8993G mtDNA (data not shown). In other experiments, incubation with reagents that induce oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide and menadione) failed to differentiate NARP mutant and control cybrids. Finally, the cellular ATP:ADP ratio decreased dramatically in ρo lung carcinoma cells incubated for 30 min in the absence of glucose, whereas NARP cybrids maintained a ratio similar to control cybrids for at least 4 h (data not shown). Thus, the decrease in ATP synthesis capacity (Fig. 6) and increase in complex V sub-complexes (Fig. 2) in disrupted NARP cells are either of no consequence to growth, even under regimes that favor expression of a functional OP system, or else these in vitro observed abnormalities are compensated in intact cells. The absence of a marked OP phenotype in intact NARP cybrids was mirrored in cybrids containing partially duplicated mtDNA (27Holt I.J. Dunbar D.R. Jacobs H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, earlier studies of A8344G (21Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell.

A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) demonstrate clear deleterious effects upon OP and mitochondrial translation of intact cybrid cells. Therefore, putative pathological mtDNA mutations cannot be excluded as a cause of disease based on absence of an OP phenotype in cultured cells. Human cells lacking mtDNA have been used widely to study the effects of putative pathological mtDNA mutations (e.g. Refs.8Trounce I. Neill S. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8334-8338Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell.

A. 1995; 92: 6562-6566Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The genetic outcome of fusing cytoplast and ρo cells is to transfer mtDNA to a new nuclear background. Thus, mtDNA can be isolated from its host nuclear DNA, and any mitochondrial dysfunction in the transformant cells can be ascribed to mtDNA, where appropriate controls are in place. In this report, mtDNA carrying a presumed pathological mutation in subunit 6 of ATP synthase was transferred to two control nuclear backgrounds to assess its effects on mitochondrial structure and function. In both nuclear backgrounds tested, T8993G mutant mtDNA was associated with decreased complex V assembly and decreased ATP synthesis capacity. Because the effects were observed with NARP mutant mtDNA in two nuclear backgrounds, they can with confidence be attributed to the mutation. Despite these abnormalities there was no marked phenotype in intact cells with mutant ATP synthase. These findings are consistent with what is known of the T8993G mtDNA mutation and its associated diseases. The mutation resides in a gene encoding an essential subunit of ATP synthase and could therefore be expected to affect the intrinsic activity or amount of holoenzyme. Nevertheless, the effects of the mutation must necessarily be subtle, first, because substantial impairment of ATP synthase would be incompatible with life and, second, because the NARP mutation is highly tissue-specific in its effects. For instance, muscle pathology is absent in NARP, whereas it is present in association with a number of other pathological mtDNA mutations. Early studies assumed that the NARP/MILS (maternally inherited Leigh syndrome) T8993G mutation decreased ATP synthesis capacity directly by impairing proton flux through the F0 portion of the enzyme,i.e. caused a decrease in intrinsic enzyme activity. The finding that the mutation was associated with increased levels of sub-complexes of complex V suggested an alternative explanation, namely that perturbed assembly or stability could lead to a decrease in the total amount of holoenzyme (9Houstek J. Klement P. Hermanska J. Houstkova H. Hansikova H. Van den Bogert C. Zeman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The results reported here indicate that sub-complexes of complex V are often present in isolated mitochondria carrying the mutant form of A6 associated with NARP, yet irrespective of this, ATP synthesis capacity was decreased. Thus, it can be concluded that the function of ATP synthase holoenzyme containing mutant A6 is impaired. The metabolic labeling experiments indicated that NARP-containing cybrids were impaired in complex V assembly (Figs. 4 and 5). Nevertheless, it is unlikely that all the antibody-detected sub-complexes (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) represent assembly intermediates; some almost certainly arose via disassembly, given the considerable variation in the ratio of sub-complexes to holoenzyme that was observed (Fig. 3). Therefore, we posit that ATP synthase-containing mutant A6 is not only assembled less efficiently than wild type but also that it is less stable. Instability of mutant-containing holoenzyme might explain much of the reported variation (30–95%) in the degree of impairment of ATP synthesis capacity (Refs. 8Trounce I. Neill S. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8334-8338Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar and 33Baracca A. Barogi S. Carelli V. Lenaz G. Solaini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4177-4182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar and this report) and some of the phenotypic difference between intact and disrupted cells. Finally, formation of sub-complexes from disrupted holoenzyme is a reasonable explanation for the observation that there was little complex V holoenzyme in muscle mitochondrial preparations of NARP patients that displayed no muscle pathology (9Houstek J. Klement P. Hermanska J. Houstkova H. Hansikova H. Van den Bogert C. Zeman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), i.e. it was likely the result of the disassembly. In summary, to reconcile the apparently disparate findings in studies of the T8993G NARP mutation, we propose that complex V-containing mutant A6 has ≥70% normal ATP synthesis capacity in intact cells, yet the enzyme is assembled less efficiently and is less stable than that of wild-type cells. Ultimately, it will be necessary to develop a sensitive assay of ATP synthase for intact cells to determine the true extent of enzyme dysfunction in NARP. Recently it was reported that IF1 was not associated with F1-ATPase of a fibroblast ρ0 cell line (34Garcia J.J. Ogilvie I. Robinson B.H. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a result that is apparently at odds with the finding reported here. The discrepancy could reflect differences between ρ0 cell lines, although a more plausible explanation is that the osmotic shock procedure used by Garcia et al. (34Garcia J.J. Ogilvie I. Robinson B.H. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) had a different effect on the mitochondria of ρ+ and ρ0 cells. Indeed, the apparent absence of IF1 may simply reflect the low yield of F1-ATPase obtained by this procedure, as the α and β subunits of F1-ATPase were in low abundance in the ρ0 cell H+-ATPase preparation of Garciaet al. (34Garcia J.J. Ogilvie I. Robinson B.H. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The combined ATP synthase abnormalities associated with NARP cybrids might become critical, for example, in particular neuronal cell types or genetic backgrounds, if the cellular environment accentuated the assembly or stability defects or increased ATP synthase turnover. In this context, it is noteworthy that there are differences in brain and muscle in the expression of isoforms of subunit c with which A6 interacts (35Gay N.J. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IF1 is expressed at relatively high levels in developing rat brain compared with muscle (36Sangawa H. Himeda T. Shibata H. Higuti T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6034-6037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that ATP hydrolysis needs to be strictly controlled in developing brain and thereby offers an explanation of how increased levels of sub-complexes of complex V resulting from the presence of the T8993G mtDNA mutation might cause tissue-specific metabolic failure.

Of the 12 residues conserved across all caveolin isoforms from all species examined to date, only Ser80 and Ser168 could serve as phosphorylation sites. We show here that mimicking chronic phosphorylation of Ser80 by mutation to Glu (i.e. Cav-1(S80E)), blocks phosphate incorporation. However, Cav-1(S168E) is phosphorylated to the same extent as wild-type caveolin-1. Cav-1(S80E) targets to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, remains oligomeric, and maintains normal membrane topology. In contrast, Cav-1(S80A), which cannot be phosphorylated, targets to caveolae membranes. Some exocrine cells secrete caveolin-1 in a regulated manner. Cav-1(S80A) is not secreted by AR42J pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells even in the presence of dexamethasone, an agent that induces the secretory phenotype. Conversely, Cav-1(S80E) is secreted to a greater extent than wild-type caveolin-1 following dexamethasone treatment.

First, caveolin-1 is a transformation-dependent substrate of v-Src, and is down-regulated in a number of cancer-derived cell lines (reviewed in Ref. 5Engelman J.A. Zhang X. Galbiati F. Volonté D.

A wealth of biochemical and cell biological knowledge has now been gathered about the structure of caveolins. Several laboratories have validated the hypothesis that a central hydrophobic segment anchors the protein to the membrane, and splits the molecule into two cytoplasmic domains (24Glenney Jr., J.R. Soppet D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10517-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar): first, antibodies directed against the extreme N and C termini fail to stain caveolin-1 in unpermeabilized cells (25Monier S.

Likewise, artificial glycosylation sites introduced at the extreme N and C termini are not glycosylated (25Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Third, caveolin-1 is not labeled when cells are subjected to surface biotinylation, suggesting that there is no extracellular domain (27Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.S.

Finally, the N terminus of caveolin-1 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation (1Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20163-20166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Glenney Jr., J.R.

Two other mammalian caveolins have been identified and characterized (29Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Caveolin-2 is expressed in many cell types that express caveolin-1 (12Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Fra A.M. Virta H. Simons K. Ikonen E. J.

Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15160-15165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 34Ikezu T.

Caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 can each form homotypic, high molecular mass oligomers containing ∼14–16 individual molecules (25Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 27Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the ER,1 homo-oligomerization is mediated by a 40-aminoacyl residue domain (residues 61–101 in caveolin-1) (27Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In the Golgi, adjacent homo-oligomers undergo a second stage of oligomerization; they interact with one another through contacts between the C-terminal domains of caveolin, in a side by side packing scheme (35Song K.S. Tang Z. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4398-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 36Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21605-21617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These oligomer-oligomer interactions then produce an interlocking network of caveolin molecules that gives rise to the striated caveolar coat seen by scanning electron microscopy (3Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar). Although much has been learned about caveolin structure and function, the role of phosphorylation has not been defined. Constitutively active v-Src phosphorylates caveolin-1 on Tyr14 in vitro (28Li S. Seitz R. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3863-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). At the permissive temperature, expression of temperature-sensitive v-Src results in tyrosine phosphorylation on Tyr14 in vivo (37Nomura R. Fujimoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A reversible flattening and aggregation of caveolae at the cell membrane occurs as a result of temperature-sensitive v-Src activation (37Nomura R. Fujimoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 38Ko Y.G. Liu P. Pathak R.K. Craig L.C. Anderson R.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition to these changes in caveolae morphology, we recently uncovered a novel interaction between caveolin-1 and the SH2 domain containing adapter molecule GRB7. Caveolin-1 binds GRB7 following growth factor-stimulated (and Src-catalyzed) phosphorylation of caveolin-1 tyrosine residue 14. Mutation of this residue to prevent phosphorylation undermines GRB7 association. When coexpressed, Src, Cav-1, and GRB7 dramatically increase anchorage-independent growth and cell migration (39Lee H. Volonté D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Downstream effector molecules remain to be identified, but this series of protein-protein interactions defines the first biological function for caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Here, we used a mutational approach to characterize the possible functional significance of phosphorylation at two serine residues conserved across all caveolin isotypes from all species examined to date. Mutation of Ser80 to glutamate, a substitution that mimics chronic phosphorylation, leads to loss of caveolin-1 from caveolae membranes and tight association with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes of fibroblasts. Mutation of Ser80 to alanine neither hinders efficient targeting of caveolin-1 to caveolae, nor disrupts interaction with wild-type caveolin-1. However, in cells of the exocrine pancreas, where caveolin-1 undergoes regulated secretion, we find that mutation of Ser80 to glutamate results in enhanced secretion, while mutation of Ser80 to alanine blocks exocytosis completely. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on Ser80 regulates caveolin-1 entry into the regulated secretory pathway by binding to ER membranes.

Monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 (clones 2234 and 2297) and anti-caveolin-3 (clone 26) were gifts from Dr. Roberto Campos González (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Rabbit anti-GDP dissociation inhibitor IgG was a gift from Dr. Perry E. Bickel (Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Anti-calnexin rabbit IgG were described previously (40Muresan Z. Arvan P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The canine caveolin-1 cDNA was as we described previously (41Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed using standard methods and verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% donor calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human embryonic kidney 293T and COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. AR42J cells were obtained from the American Type Cell Collection (CRL-1492) and were propagated in Kaighn's modified Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (F-12K) supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 293T cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. COS-7 cells (grown to 40% confluence in a 3.5-mm diameter dish) were transfected with Fugene 6 using 2 μg of DNA and 3 μl of transfection agent (diluted in 97 μl of serum-free medium) as directed by the manufacturer. AR42J cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE PLUS as described below. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and stained with Ponceau S (Sigma). Membranes were then washed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (wash buffer), blocked in wash buffer supplemented with 2% nonfat milk and 1% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer), incubated with primary antibody, washed again, and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Bound IgGs were detected using a chemiluminescent substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Monoclonal mouse IgG and donkey-anti mouse IgG were diluted in wash buffer supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Polyclonal rabbit IgG and donkey anti-rabbit IgG were diluted in blocking buffer. The topology of caveolin-1 was monitored as described (42Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 43Zelenski N.G.

Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were scraped into the culture medium, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS, and pelleted again. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were then resuspended in 0.4 ml of iso-osmotic buffer (20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA), and homogenized by 30 passes through a 22-gauge needle. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Membranes were then pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 0.4 ml of digestion buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3. One-hundred microliter aliquots were then incubated with or without trypsin for 30 min. Where indicated, samples were adjusted to 60 mm n-octylglucoside prior to addition of trypsin. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1% SDS, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, 293T cells (grown to confluence in a 100-mm diameter dish) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 1 ml of IP buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm n-octylglucoside, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 0.1 μg/ml okadaic acid supplemented with protease inhibitors). Debris was removed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 10 min. Lysates were pre-cleared by incubation with 30 μl of Protein-A Sepharose for 45 min at 4 °C and then transferred to fresh tubes containing 30 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Protein A-Sepharose and IP buffer. Two micrograms of IgG were added to the mixture. For coimmunoprecipitation studies, rabbit anti-GFP IgG or mouse anti-caveolin-3 IgG were used as an irrelevant control. Following a 4-h incubation at 4 °C, immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed six times in 1 ml of IP buffer and four times with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA; and were disrupted by boiling in 1% SDS. Triton X-100 extraction, purification of caveolin-rich membranes, hypotonic lysis, and fractionation of proteins into soluble and particulate fractions, and extraction with alkaline sodium carbonate were all performed exactly as we described in detail previously (36Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21605-21617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). [3H]Palmitate incorporation was monitored as we described previously (44Galbiati F. Volonté D. Minetti C. Chu J.B. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25632-25641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, 16 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and cultured for 1 h in labeling medium (DMEM, 5% dialyzed FBS, 5 mm sodium pyruvate). Cells were labeled for 4 h with 300 μCi of [3H]palmitic acid in 2 ml of labeling medium, washed twice with PBS, and subjected to lysis in immunoprecipitation buffer. Proteins were immunoprecipitated, and separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The gel was impregranted with sodium salicilate, dried, and processed for autoradiography, as we described previously (45Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Davitz M.A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and detected by immunoblot analysis. Steady state incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate was monitored as follows: Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, grown to confluence in two 150-mm diameter dishes, were serum-starved for 12 h, and then cultured in phosphate-free DMEM, supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS, 1 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h. Cells were then scraped into 2 ml of 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 0.1 μg/ml okadaic acid, 100 nm calyculin A, supplemented with protease inhibitors. The lysate was homogenized and caveolae were purified by sucrose density centrifugation as described (17Schlegel A. Schwab R.B. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22660-22667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 36Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21605-21617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the gradient. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) and resuspended by boiling in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris pH, 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) for 1 min. Caveolin-1 was immunoprecipitated as described above using anti-caveolin-1 rabbit IgG N-20. Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, proteins were detected by autoradiography and immunoblot analysis. [32P]Orthophosphate incorporation into mutated caveolin-1 was monitored as follows: 16 h post-transfection, 293T cells were washed twice with PBS and cultured for 3 h in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Caveolin-1 was immunoprecipitated. [32P]orthophosphate and protein expression were assessed as described above. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, 293T cells grown to confluence in a 10-cm dish were subjected to lysis in 1 ml of 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 60 mm octylglucoside (MBS-OG), supplemented with protease inhibitors. Two-hundred microliters of the lysate was loaded atop a 5–40% linear sucrose gradient (prepared in MBS-OG) cast in an 11 × 45-mm ultraclear centrifuge tube. Samples were subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 × g(44,000 rpm in Sorval rotor TH-660) for 12 h. Twelve 375-μl fractions were collected and equal volume aliquots of each were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis (27Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Thirty-six hours post-transfection, COS-7 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2 (PBS-CM); fixed in ice-cold methanol/acetone, 1:1 (v/v), for 10 min at −20 °C; and air-dried at room temperature. Cells were then rehydrated in PBS-CM. Epitope-tagged caveolin-1 was detected with anti-c-Myc antibodies (mAb 9E10 or pAbs A14). Fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies were used to visualize bound IgG on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope. Images were obtained using a Photonics Cooled CCD camera or a Noran Oz laser scanning confocal microscope with a ×60 NA 1.4 objective lens. All microscopy was performed at the Analytical Imaging Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. COS-7 cells were washed twice with PBS, and then treated for 5 min at 37 °C with 10 mmmethyl-β-cyclodextrin (46Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). After cholesterol depletion, cells were washed, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. Caveolin-1 secretion by cells of the exocrine pancreas was monitored as described (47Liu P. Li W.P. Machleidt T. Anderson R.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. AR42J rat pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells grown to 60% confluence in a 100-mm diameter plate were transfected with LipofectAMINE PLUS as follows: caveolin-1 cDNA (6 μg of DNA) was mixed with 20 μl of PLUS reagent and 30 μl LipofectAMINE in a final volume of 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM, exactly as suggested by the manufacturer. Cells were washed twice with PBS; the medium was replaced with 5 ml of Opti-MEM; and the DNA-lipid complex was added. After 3 h, cells were washed twice in PBS, and cultured for an additional 33 h in F-12K, 20% FBS. Cells were washed again, cultured in 2.5 ml of F-12K, 20% FBS, 4 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 500 μm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and were treated with 100 nm dexamethasone (or vehicle, ethanol) for 12 h. The medium was collected, adjusted to pH 7.9 with HEPES (50 mm final concentration). Triton X-100 was added (1% final concentration) and caveolin-1 was immunoprecipitated as described above using mAb 2234, and detected by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-c-Myc IgG A14 or mouse anti-c-Myc IgG 9E10. Caveolin-1 is phosphorylated on serine and tyrosine residues. Phosphoamino acid analysis reveals that the ratio of phosphoserine to phosphotyrosine is 10:1 (48Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.L. Casanova J.E. Lisanti M.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2589-2595PubMed Google Scholar). The role of caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in signal transduction and subcellular localization has been examined recently (39Lee H. Volonté D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of serine phosphorylation in caveolin-1 function has not been studied. We performed metabolic labeling of Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells to assess the steady state distribution of phosphorylated caveolin-1. Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid, cultured in complete medium, and then subjected to lysis in cold Triton X-100 buffer. The lysate was then fractionated in an established sucrose density gradient that separates caveolae membranes from the bulk of cellular proteins (41Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar,49Lisanti M.P. Tang Z.L. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that the bulk of the32P label remained at the bottom of the gradient (loading zone fractions 9–12). In contrast caveolin-1 immunoreactivity and [32P]orthophosphate incorporation were detected in the low density fraction (fraction 5) enriched in purified caveolae. Since caveolin-1 is phosphorylated on serine and tyrosine residues in a ratio of 10:1 (48Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.L. Casanova J.E. Lisanti M.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2589-2595PubMed Google Scholar), caveolin-1 phosphate incorporation at steady state can be attributed largely to serine phosphorylation. Inspection of the caveolin family of primary sequences reveals that only 12 residues are conserved across all isoforms from every species examined to date (i.e. fromCaenorhabditis elegans to Homo sapiens) (50Minetti C. Sotgia F. Bruno C. Scartezzini P. Broda P. Bado M. Masetti E. Mazzocco M. Egeo A. Donati M.A. Volonté D. Galbiati F. Cordone G. Bricarelli F.D. Lisanti M.P. Zara F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18"
https://openalex.org/W1987492472,"The regulation of phosphatidylcholine degradation as a function of the route of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis and changing environmental conditions has been investigated in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. In the wild-type strains studied, deacylation of phosphatidylcholine to glycerophosphocholine is induced when choline is supplied to the culture medium and, also, when the culture temperature is raised from 30 to 37 °C. In strains bearing mutations in any of the genes encoding enzymes of the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis (CKI1, choline kinase; CPT1, 1, 2-diacylglycerol choline phosphotransferase; PCT1, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase), no induction of phosphatidylcholine turnover and glycerophosphocholine production is seen in response to choline availability or elevated temperature. In contrast, the induction of phosphatidylcholine deacylation does occur in a strain bearing mutations in genes encoding enzymes of the methylation pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis (i.e. CHO2/PEM1 andOPI3/PEM2). Whereas the synthesis of PC via CDP-choline is accelerated when shifted from 30 to 37 °C, synthesis of PC via the methylation pathway is largely unaffected by the temperature shift. These results suggest that the deacylation of PC to GroPC requires an active CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis but not an active methylation pathway. Furthermore, the data indicate that the synthesis and turnover of CDP-choline-derived PC, but not methylation pathway-derived PC, are accelerated by the stress of elevated temperature.

The stepwise methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to PC occurs through the action of a pair of methyltransferases encoded by the CHO 2/PEM1 and OPI3/PEM2 genes (Fig.1 B). The CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis (in which CDP-choline is an intermediate) consists of three reactions catalyzed by choline kinase (Cki1p) as follows: CTP, phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (Pct1p); and 1,2-diacylglycerol choline phosphotransferase (Cpt1p), respectively (Fig. 1 B). The CDP-choline pathway requires free choline, which can be obtained through exogenous sources or as a result of the phospholipase D (PLD)-mediated hydrolysis of PC. As in yeast, hepatocytes synthesize PC through both the methylation and the CDP-choline pathways, whereas other mammalian cell types produce only minor amounts of PC through the methylation of PE (1Kent C. Carman G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 146-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although the regulation of PC biosynthesis, and phospholipid biosynthesis in general, has been well studied in S. cerevisiae (2Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the regulation of phospholipid turnover has gathered much less attention. PC is known to be catabolized by B and D type phospholipases in S. cerevisiae. Phospholipase B (PLB) deacylates PC to produce glycerophosphocholine (GroPC) and free fatty acids, whereas PLD hydrolyzes PC to phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline (Fig. 1 A). Three PLB genes (PLB1, PLB2, andPLB3) have been identified in Bakers' yeast (3Lee K.S. Patton J.L. Fido M. Hines L.K. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Henry S.A. Levin D.E. J. Biol.

Studies in S. cerevisiae indicate not only that phospholipid synthesis and turnover are highly integrated but that PC metabolism, in particular, plays a central role in the regulation of this metabolic network. Many of the phospholipid biosynthetic genes are transcriptionally repressed by the addition of inositol to the culture medium (38Paltauf F. Kohlwein S. Henry S.A. Broach J. Jones E. Pringle J. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar). Additionally, regulation in response to inositol availability requires ongoing PC biosynthesis (38Paltauf F. Kohlwein S. Henry S.A. Broach J. Jones E. Pringle J. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar), suggesting that a signal emanating from the metabolism itself is responsible for controlling the transcription of the coordinately regulated phospholipid biosynthetic genes. By using mutants blocked at various steps of PC biosynthesis and mutants exhibiting alterations in PC turnover, it has been shown that conditions that result in elevated PLD-mediated turnover of PC, and therefore, elevated levels of PA or a closely related metabolite cause constitutive expression of the phospholipid biosynthetic genes (10Patton-Vogt J.L.

These results and others indicate that delineation of the molecular mechanisms controlling phospholipid metabolism will require a detailed knowledge of the factors affecting all pathways for PC synthesis and degradation. In the present study we continue the analysis of PC metabolism, focusing on the deacylation of PC to GroPC. In particular, we have employedS. cerevisiae strains bearing mutations in the genes encoding enzymes of the CDP-choline and the methylation pathways for PC biosynthesis to examine how the route and extent of PC biosynthesis are coupled to the turnover of PC to GroPC. Strains were maintained on YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, 2% glucose, Difco YPD Broth). All experiments were performed in chemically defined synthetic media (18Griac P. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25692-25698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) without inositol and containing 20 μm, 1 mm, or 10 mm choline, as detailed below. Where indicated, the media also contained [14C]choline or [14C]methylmethionine (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.). The cki1Δ strain (MATa, ura3, his3, cki1::HIS3) and its congenic wild type, WT-A (MATa, ura3, his3, trp1), were constructed as described (11Sreenivas A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Bruno V. Griac P. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16635-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The PCT1 gene of WT-A (nucleotides 41–2274) was replaced with the dominant resistance markerKanMX (19Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar) by a one-step gene replacement to producepct1Δ (MATa, ura3, his3, trp1, pct1::KanMX). Correct placement of theKanMX marker at the PCT1 locus was verified by polymerase chain reaction. The cpt1Δ strain (MATa leu2 ura3 trp1 his3 cpt1::LEU2) and its congenic wild type, WT-B (MATa leu2 ura3 trp1 his3), were isolated by crossing HJ100 (MATa his3 leu2 ura3 trp1 cpt1::LEU2 ept1::URA3) (18Griac P.

Thecho2Δ opi3Δ strain (MATαhis3 ade2 leu2 ura3 cho2::LEU2 opi3::URA3) and its congenic wild type, WT-C (MATα leu2 ade2 ura3), were isolated by crossing SH414 (MATa opi3::URA3 ade2 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3) × SH458 (MATα ura3 leu2 his3 cho2::LEU2), sporulating the resulting diploid, and performing tetrad analysis. The following strains and their isogenic wild types were generously provided by Fritz Paltauf, Technical University, Graz: plb1Δ (MATα his3 trp1 leu2 ade2 ura3 plb1::URA3), plb2Δ (MATa his3 trp1 leu2 ade2 ura3 plb2::KanMX), plb3Δ (MATα his3 trp1 leu2 ade2 ura3 plb3::KanMX), plb1Δ plb2Δplb3Δ (MATa his3 trp1 leu2 ura3 plb1::URA3 plb2::KanMX plb3::KanMX). Cells were grown to uniform labeling in medium containing 1 μCi/ml [14C]choline (20 μm), harvested in logarithmic phase, washed twice in fresh nonradioactive medium, and inoculated at A 600 = 0.1 in medium containing 10 mm nonradioactive choline. At various times, 1-ml aliquots of the cultures were removed, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was saved as the “medium” fraction. The cell pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and incubated on ice for 20 min with occasional vortexing. Following centrifugation, the supernatant containing the acid extract was saved as the “intracellular water-soluble fraction” of the cell (20Patton J.L. Pessoa-Brandao L. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3379-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of 1 m Tris buffer, pH 8, centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was added to the intracellular water-soluble fraction, effectively neutralizing the acidic extract. The cell pellet was saved as the “membrane” fraction. The recovery of total counts (medium, membrane, and intracellular water-soluble fraction) at each time point was ≥90%. Phospholipids were extracted from the membrane fraction as described previously (21Atkinson K.D. Ramirez R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 80-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine was resolved by SG81 (Whatman) paper chromatography in chloroform:methanol:NH4OH (66:17:3) and the spot excised, and concentrations were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Alternatively, PC content was determined by subjecting the chromatogram to PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. The choline-containing compounds (i.e. choline, choline-phosphate (Cho-P), and GroPC) in the medium and the intracellular water-soluble fractions were separated by either TLC (22Martin T.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 962: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or ion-exchange chromatography (23Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and concentrations were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in synthetic medium containing 1 mm choline. The cultures were split into two flasks; theA 600 of each was adjusted to 0.5, one flask incubated at 30 °C and the other flask at 37 °C. After 15 min of incubation for temperature adjustment, 1 μCi/ml of either [14C]choline or [14C]methionine was added to the cultures. At 20-, 40-, and 60-min intervals, 900-μl aliquots of the cultures were removed to tubes containing 100 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid to kill the cells, and the tubes were incubated on ice for 30 min. Radiolabeled PC was extracted and quantified as described above. For cultures grown at 30 °C in plus and minus 1.0 mm choline media, 1-liter cultures were grown overnight to mid-logarithmic phase (A 600 0.5–0.7). For cultures grown under temperature shift conditions, strains grown overnight at 30 °C in 10 μm choline were diluted into 500 ml of media (A 600 0.2) containing 10 mm choline at the requisite temperature of either 30 or 37 °C and shaken for 6 h. To harvest the cells, the cultures were rapidly cooled in an ice bath, the cells collected by centrifugation, washed with water, and the wet paste placed at −70 °C. The frozen cell paste was treated with 2 volumes of 1 n perchloric acid at 5 °C, vortexed, and freeze-thawed 2 times (24Wells G.B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7235-7243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the supernatant was neutralized with 2.5 n KOH, centrifuged to remove the precipitated KClO4, and the solution lyophilized. The dried samples were dissolved in 0.8 ml of 50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, plus 10% D2O as an internal lock source. 31P NMR analysis was performed on 0.6 ml of the sample plus 20 μl of triethylphosphate (TEP) as an internal standard for both chemical shift and calibration (final concentration, 0.16 mm). The 31P NMR spectra were acquired using a 300-MHz Bruker DXR spectrometer with a multinuclear probe set to 121.5 MHz for phosphorus. The spectra were accumulated for 1 h to ensure sufficient signal and processed with integration using Bruker software. Metabolites were identified by comparison to known compounds and published chemical shifts (25Robitaille P.-M.L. Robitaille P.A. Brown J. Brown G.G. J. Magn. Res. 1991; 92: 73-84Google Scholar). Strains grown to anA 600 of 0.5–0.7 in 25–50 ml of the indicated media were harvested, washed with water, and suspended in 5% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. The cells were harvested and washed two times with water, and 50 μg of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine was added to the cell pellet as a standard. Phospholipids were extracted as described (21Atkinson K.D. Ramirez R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 80-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the dried lipid extract was dissolved to a concentration of ∼10 pmol of lipid species/μl in CH3OH/CHCl3 (2:1) containing 5 mm LiOH (26Ramanadham S. Hsu F. Zhang S. Bohrer A. Ma Z. Turk J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (Finnigan LCQ) was used to determine the molecular species of the cellular PCs. Previous reports have shown that PC in S. cerevisiae is hydrolyzed by PLD to produce PA and choline (10Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol.

Thus, we undertook a thorough analysis of the regulation of PC turnover in response to choline availability, temperature, and genetic perturbations of the biosynthetic routes for PC production. Wild-type cells prelabeled with [14C]choline, washed free of radioactivity, and chased with excess choline at 30 °C (Fig.2 A), exhibited a pattern of label movement indicative of PLD-mediated turnover. Radiolabel associated with PC slowly diminished, and a concomitant amount of label appeared in the medium, primarily as free choline (Table I, part B). The appearance of labeled choline in the medium suggested that the choline produced through PLD-mediated turnover exited the cell, as is known to occur in mammalian cells (28Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Since S. cerevisiae rapidly incorporates free choline into PC via the CDP-choline pathway, the nonradioactive choline chase was necessary to dilute out the [14C]choline produced through PC turnover and, thereby, obtain an accurate assessment of the turnover.Table IEffect of temperature on the flux of [14C]choline-containing metabolitesA.

Data are presented as a percentage of the total counts recovered at each time point. In contrast to the PC turnover observed at 30 °C, a wild-type strain uniformly labeled with [14C]choline at 30 °C and then shifted from 30 to 37 °C in the presence of a cold choline chase exhibited massive PC degradation (Fig. 2 B). The label lost from PC appeared in the intracellular fraction, primarily as GroPC (Table I, part A). Since there is no evidence for synthesis of GroPC de novo in any eukaryotic cell (29Veldhuizen R.A. Thompson W. Possmayer F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 30Thompson W. Belina H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), the shift from 30 to 37 °C is most likely to have induced the deacylation of PC to GroPC. These patterns of PC turnover occurred in all three wild-type strains that were tested (data not shown). A mutant lacking choline kinase (cki1Δ), the first enzyme of the CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis, incorporates [14C]choline into PC at 10% of the wild-type level (10Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P.

Even though the cki1Δ mutant lacks choline kinase, the action of an ethanolamine kinase that has some specificity for choline (31Kim K. Kim K.H. Storey M.K. Voelker D.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14857-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) can explain the minor degree of incorporation found. This mutant, which was used to monitor the effect of decreased production of CDP-choline pathway-derived PC, exhibited a pattern of radiolabel distribution different than that of the wild type. Taken as a percentage of total choline-associated radiolabel, thecki1Δ mutant contained less intracellular GroPC than wild type at 30 °C, and neither PC degradation nor GroPC levels increased at 37 °C when 10 mm choline was present (Table II). One interpretation of this result is that Cki1p itself is required for cells to induce GroPC formation in response to temperature elevation. Alternatively, the CDP-choline pathway, in general, may be necessary for the response. To distinguish between these possibilities, acpt1Δ deletion mutant, which lacks the enzyme responsible for the final step of the CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis (Fig.1), but which can incorporate [14C]choline label into PC due to the action of an ethanolamine phosphotransferase (31Kim K.

The cpt1Δ mutant, like the cki1Δ mutant, was unable to induce PC deacylation when shifted from 30 to 37 °C (data not shown), suggesting that it is a functional CDP-choline pathway that is required to induce PC deacylation upon temperature elevation. The pct1Δ mutant could not be analyzed in this manner, as it incorporated no [14C]choline label into PC.Table IIFlux of [14C]choline-containing metabolites in a cki1Δ mutantA.

To explore further the role of the CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis in PC deacylation, 31P NMR spectroscopy was employed, as it overcomes the drawbacks associated with radiolabeling cells with [14C]choline. [14C]Choline labeling monitors only the PC derived from the CDP-choline pathway and not the PC derived from the methylation of PE. Furthermore, the labeling of CDP-choline pathway mutants with [14C]choline is necessarily limited, as the incorporation of choline into PC depends upon the CDP-choline pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2116414519,"The chaperone activity of Hsp70 is influenced by the activities of both positive and negative regulatory proteins. In this study, we provide first time evidence for the stimulating effect of the Hsp70-interacting protein Hip on the chaperone activity in the mammalian cytosol. Overexpressing Hip enhances the refolding of the heat-inactivated reporter enzyme luciferase expressed in hamster lung fibroblasts. Also, it protects luciferase from irreversible denaturation under conditions of ATP depletion. We demonstrate that these stimulating actions depend on both the presence of the central Hsp70-binding site and the amino-terminal homo-oligomerization domain of Hip. The carboxyl terminus (amino acids 257–368) comprising the 7 GGMP repeats (Hsc70-like domain) and the Sti1p-like domain are dispensable for the Hip-mediated stimulation of the cellular chaperone activity. Bag-1, which inhibits the Hsp70 chaperone activity bothin vitro and in vivo, was found to compete with the stimulatory action of Hip. In cells overexpressing both Hip and Bag-1, the inhibitory effects of Bag-1 were found to be dominant. Our results reveal that in vivo a complex level of regulation of the cellular chaperone activity exists that not only depends on the concentration of Hsp70 but also on the concentration, affinity, and intracellular localization of positive and negative coregulators.

Hsp70 chaperones have a specialized domain capable of binding exposed hydrophobic stretches in polypeptide chains, which would otherwise aggregate within the densely packed environment of the cell. Substrate binding and release is coupled to a cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis by Hsp70. In vitro, a variety of regulatory proteins of this Hsp70 cycle have been identified that influence the properties of the Hsp70 chaperone in protein refolding. Proteins of the Hsp40/DNA-J family can increase the Hsp70 chaperone activity by enhancing the ATPase activity of Hsp70 (4Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I.

This action is dependent on the interaction of the J-domain of Hsp40 with the ATP binding domain of Hsp70, but it also requires the interaction between the extreme carboxyl-terminal EEVD sequence of Hsp70 and the carboxyl-terminal domain of Hsp40. By using a luciferase reporter assay in mammalian cells, we demonstrated that Hsp40 in vivo also stimulates Hsp70-mediated refolding (6Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33283-33289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In fact, by using dominant negative Hsp40 mutants, we found that the Hsp70 chaperone activity was completely inhibited, thereby proving that interaction with J-domain-containing proteins is required for the in vivo refolding activity of Hsp70 (7Michels A.A.

The homo-oligomeric protein Hip cooperates with Hsp70 in protein folding by stabilizing the ADP-bound state of Hsp70. Hip directly binds to the ATPase domain of Hsp70 when it is converted to the ADP-bound state by proteins of the Hsp40 family (8Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The Hsp70-binding site of Hip consists of multiple tetratricopeptide repeats and a flanking charged α-helix. The extreme amino terminus contains a domain required for Hip oligomerization. As monomeric Hip still can bind to Hsp70, homo-oligomerization is not required for Hsp70 interaction (9Irmer H. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2230-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Besides affecting the Hsp70 chaperone cycle in vitro, Hip alone can also bind to unfolded proteins and prevent their aggregation. Yet refolding of proteins to their active state requires cooperation with other chaperones (8Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 10Bruce B.D. Churchich J. Eur. J Biochem. 1997; 245: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).

In addition to these positive regulators of the Hsp70 chaperone two inhibitory proteins, CHIP and Bag-1, have been identified in vitro. CHIP, also a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein, inhibits the ATPase activity of Hsp70 (12Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell.

All Bag-1-like proteins share a conserved 40–50-amino acid “BAG” domain and compete with Hip in binding to the ATPase domain of Hsp70 in vitro(14Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C.

Here we investigated whether Hip and Bag-1 affect Hsp70 chaperone activity in hamster fibroblasts and Chinese hamster ovary cells. In both these cell lines, Hsc70 is constitutively expressed, whereas Hsp70 is only expressed upon exposure of the cells to stress. Overexpressed Hip exclusively localized to the cytoplasm and enhanced refolding of heat-inactivated cytoplasmic luciferase and protected it from inactivation during ATP depletion. For both activities the presence of the Hsp70-binding site as well as the oligomerization domain was required. Hip was active when overexpressed alone as well as when overexpressed together with Hsp70 suggesting that it stimulates the action of both Hsc70 and Hsp70. As demonstrated before (17Nollen E.A. Brunsting J.F. Song J. Kampinga H.H. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), Bag-1 inhibited Hsp70 chaperone function. In cells overexpressing Hip and Bag-1, the inhibitory effects of Bag-1 were dominant. The results reveal that in vivo a complex level of regulation of the Hsp70 chaperone activity exists. Furthermore, they show that cycling between an ATP/ADP-bound state is not absolutely required for the Hsp70 chaperone machine to be active. pRSVLL/V encodes cytoplasmic luciferase under control of a Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat promoter (provided by Dr. S.

Hip and Hip mutants were inserted into pCDNA-3/HA1 after polymerase chain reaction amplification resulting in an in-frame fusion of a triple hemagglutinin tag. pCDNA/HA-BAG-1 and pCDNA/HA-BAG-1ΔC were created by cloning an Eco RI-Xho I fragment from pGEX-4T-1/BAG-1 and pGEX-4T-1/BAG-1ΔC (14Takayama S.

Plasmid pCMV70 was constructed by inserting aHin dIII fragment encoding the cDNA for Hsp70.1, the human-inducible DnaK homologue (20Hunt C. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

OT70 cells are hamster lung fibroblasts (O23) in which Hsp70 expression can be controlled by the tetracycline-responsive transactivator (tTA) expression system (21Nollen E.A. Brunsting J.F. Roelofsen H. Weber L.A. Kampinga H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2069-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mg/ml hygromycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 3 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). G418 and hygromycin were absent during all experiments. For ATP depletion experiments Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were used as they were more sensitive to ATP depletion-mediated proteotoxicity than the hamster lung fibroblast. The CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For both cell lines, transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE according to the procedure of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). For the heat shock experiments, OT70 cells were transiently transfected with pRSVLL/V and co-chaperone-encoding plasmids or pCDNA as a control. 24 h after transfection, the cells were transferred into tissue culture tubes in medium with or without 3 μg/ml tetracycline for induction of Hsp70 expression. Another 24 h later, the medium was replaced with medium containing 20 μg/ml cycloheximide and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. After a 30-min preincubation, cells were heated for 30 min at 45 °C to inactivate luciferase. Subsequently, the cells were reincubated at 37 °C to allow for reactivation of luciferase. At various time points, triplicate samples were taken for the measurements of luciferase activity as described before (22Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Konings A.W. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For the ATP depletion experiments, CHO cells were transiently transfected with pRSVLL/V and co-chaperone-encoding plasmids or pCDNA as a control. 24 or 48 h after transfection, the cells were transferred into tissue culture tubes and incubated at 37 °C in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 3% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), and 20 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (23Loktionova S.A. Ilyinskaya O.P. Kabakov A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H2147-H2158PubMed Google Scholar). During this incubation triplicate samples were taken for measurement of luciferase activity. For Western blot analysis the cells were trypsinized, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed by addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and sonicated prior to SDS/Western blot analysis. The HA-tagged Hip and HA-tagged BAG-1 proteins were detected using a monoclonal HA antibody (provided by Dr. R. Lamb, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL). Hsp70 was detected by C92, a monoclonal antibody specific for the heat-inducible form of Hsp70 (Stressgen). Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (6Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33283-33289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). OT70 cells transfected with pCDNA/HA-Hip or pCDNA/HA-BAG-1 were immunostained with the mouse monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody and an fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma). The images were made by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss). Determination of the relative ATP content in cell lysates was based on the same measurement of ATP-dependent luciferase activity (22Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Konings A.W. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas exogenous luciferin and luciferase but not ATP were added to the lysates (24Nguyen V.T. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The light emission was measured on a luminometer for 10 s after mixing the cell lysate aliquots (0.15 ml) with 0.1 ml of a lysing buffer containing 5 μg/ml luciferase, 0.3 mmluciferin, 0.3 mm AMP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The ATP level in untreated cells was considered as 100%. Care was taken to use the same amount of cells (105) in the same volume of a lysing buffer. A biochemical assay that allows the measurement of cellular chaperone activity in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartment of mammalian cells has been previously established (22Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Konings A.W. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This assay has allowed us to delineate the in vivo chaperone activity of Hsp70 and modulation thereof by Hsp40/HdJ-1 (6Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2069-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and Bag-1 (17Nollen E.A. Brunsting J.F. Song J. Kampinga H.H. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this model luciferase is expressed in the nucleus or cytoplasm of hamster cells that are subsequently heated, after which activity of the enzyme is measured at various time points after heat shock. HA-tagged Hip was transiently expressed in OT70 hamster fibroblasts in which only Hsc70 and not Hsp70 is constitutively expressed and in which Hsp70 expression can be regulated by the tetracycline-responsive system (21Nollen E.A. Brunsting J.F. Roelofsen H. Weber L.A. Kampinga H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2069-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Expression of HA-Hip did not influence basal Hsp70 nor did it affect TET-inducible Hsp70 expression (Fig.1 A), as was shown before (8Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Hip was exclusively present in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B) and did not change its localization upon heat shock (data not shown). In the absence of Hsp70 expression, overexpression of Hip resulted in an increase in the refolding of the cytoplasmic luciferase (Fig.1 C). When overexpressed together with Hsp70, Hip also enhanced the refolding of cytoplasmic luciferase to levels above that for expression of Hsp70 alone (Fig. 1 D). Consistent with the cytoplasmic localization of Hip, no effect of Hip has been detected on the inactivation and recovery of nuclear luciferase (data not shown). To establish the mode of action of Hip-mediated enhancement of the cellular chaperone capacity, we expressed a variety of mutant variants that were previously characterized in vitro in terms of their ability to bind to Hsc/Hsp70 and their ability to oligomerize (Fig. 2, A and B(9)). None of the expressed mutants resulted in an induction of Hsp70, indicating that they did not cause a stress response in the cells. Also, they did not affect the level of induction of Hsp70 by tetracycline removal (data not shown), and all mutant proteins were expressed to equal levels as the wild-type proteins as detected by an HA antibody (Fig. 2 B). The Hip mutant with a truncation of the homo-oligomerization domain but containing the entire Hsp70 binding domain (Hip-(15–368)) was not capable of stimulating luciferase refolding after heat shock like wild-type Hip alone (Fig.2 C) and also could not stimulate refolding in the presence of Hsp70 (Fig. 2 D). This implies that oligomerization of Hip is required for its enhancement of the cellular chaperone activity. Expression of the mutant Hip that lacks part of or the entire Hsp70 binding domain but contains the amino-terminal oligomerization domain (Hip-(1–218)) was also incapable of stimulating protein folding in the cell (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, the observed enhanced refolding under the condition of Hip overexpression seems to depend on the interaction with Hsp70 or Hsc70 (when the tetracycline system is not induced). Expression of the Hip-(110–368) protein, lacking both the Hsp70 binding and oligomerization capacity was also ineffective in stimulating Hsp70-mediated recovery (Fig. 2, C and D). However, the mutants Hip-(1–303) and Hip-(1–257) were as effective as the full-length Hip in enhancing luciferase refolding (Fig. 2, C and D). This indicates that the last 110 carboxyl-terminal amino acids (amino acids 258–368) are not essential in for the effects of Hip. By having established that Hip can stimulate Hsp70-mediated refolding of heat-inactivated luciferase, we wanted to gain further insight in the mechanism of this effect. In vitro data have shown that Hip results in the stabilization of the Hsp70-ADP substrate complex (8Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). To test this in vivo we decided to investigate the effect of Hsp70 and Hip in cells after ATP depletion. Such treatments were shown to be proteotoxic and capable of inducing protein inactivation and aggregation, including inactivation and insolubilization of the reporter enzyme firefly luciferase (24Nguyen V.T. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Kabakov A.E. Gabai V.L. Heat Shock Proteins and Cytoprotection: ATP-deprived Mammalian Cells. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 49-77Crossref Google Scholar, 26Kabakov A.E. Gabai V.L. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 706-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, ATP depletion in CHO cells was accomplished by treatment with 10 mm2-deoxyglucose + 20 μm CCCP in the glucose-free medium. This treatment results in a rapid decline of total cellular ATP to less than 2% after 60 min (Fig.3 A). Overexpression of chaperones had no effect of the kinetics of ATP depletion (data not shown). As a result of the ATP depletion luciferase activity gradually declined in the cells, with kinetics about 4-fold slower than that for the ATP depletion (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to the situation after heat shock where luciferase can be refolded from the heat-denatured state when the heat treatment is not severe or when chaperones are overexpressed, no significant luciferase refolding was observed upon ATP replenishment under any of the conditions tested (data not shown). Remarkably, when the ATP-dependent Hsp70 chaperone was overexpressed, the rate of luciferase denaturation during ATP depletion was clearly attenuated. Hsp40/Hdj-1 overexpression alone or combined with Hsp70 had no effect on the rate of luciferase inactivation during ATP depletion (Fig. 3 B). The latter is consistent with the presumed mechanistic action of Hsp40, i.e. stimulation of the conversion of the ATP-bound state of Hsp70 to an ADP-bound state by accelerating ATP hydrolysis (4Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 5Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Like for heat shock, full-length Hip was capable of enhancing the cellular chaperone activity under conditions of ATP depletion. Luciferase inactivation was retarded in cells overexpressing Hip; this action was again dependent on the ability of Hip to oligomerize and to bind to Hsp/Hsc70 as mutants lacking the respective domains were incapable of demonstrating chaperone activity (Fig. 3 C). Combining Hip and Hsp70 overexpression led to a moderate further protection compared with either Hip or Hsp70 overexpression alone (data not shown). We have previously shown that various isoforms of the Bag-1 protein can inhibit the in vivo chaperone action of Hsp70 at physiologically relevant, stoichiometric levels (17Nollen E.A. Brunsting J.F. Song J. Kampinga H.H. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In vitro data have indicated that both Hip and Bag-1 compete for interaction with the ATPase domain of Hsp70 in vitro(14Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aimesempe C. Xie Z.H. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 15Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 16Hohfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 18Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Therefore, we transiently coexpressed Bag-1 (29-kDa isoform) and Hip, either alone or jointly in luciferase expressing OT70 cells, and we examined the effects of Hsp70-mediated reactivation of heat-inactivated luciferase. As demonstrated before (17Nollen E.A. Brunsting J.F. Song J. Kampinga H.H. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) the 29-kDa Bag-1 predominantly localized in the nucleus but also could be clearly detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 A). Both Hip and Bag-1 were HA-tagged and expressed to equal total levels in OT70 cells (Fig. 4 B). Considering the exclusive cytoplasmic localization of Hip (Fig. 1 B), we therefore conclude that its cytoplasmic concentration is higher than the cytoplasmic concentration of Bag-1. The HA-Bag-1, although predominantly nuclear, was capable of substantially inhibiting the Hsp70-mediated recovery of cytoplasmic luciferase. Surprisingly, coexpression of Bag-1 and Hip led to one-half the reactivation of the cytoplasmic luciferase compared with overexpression of Hip and Hsp70 alone (Fig. 3 C). This suggests that the inhibitory effect of Bag-1 is dominant to the stimulatory effect of Hip. The inhibitory effect of Bag-1 requires its carboxyl-terminal Hsp70 binding domain as overexpression of Bag-ΔC did not inhibit the stimulatory effects of Hip (data not shown). In vitro experiments have identified several partner proteins of Hsp70 that regulate its function as a molecular chaperone. These include both positive regulators (Hsp40/Hdj1 and Hip) and negative regulators (CHIP, Bag-1) (4Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I.

One valid issue is whether in vitro chaperone-mediated protein refolding studies accurately reflect in vivo events given the high cellular concentration of proteins, the vast excess of potential substrates, and that each cellular compartment has multiple chaperones. Here, we have focused on the in vivo action of Hip, a member of a distinct family of Hsp70 co-chaperones that interacts with the Hsp70 ATPase domain and enhances folding of denatured luciferase in vitro (8Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 27Luders J. Demand J. Schonfelder S. Frien M. Zimmermann R. Hohfeld J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In vivo, Hip is a component of steroid hormone receptor complexes and is also involved in the assembly of Hsp70 into multichaperone complexes with Hsp90 (11Prapapanich V. Chen S. Nair S.C. Rimerman R.A. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 420-431PubMed Google Scholar, 28Prapapanich V. Chen S.Y. Smith D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 944-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A role for Hip as a positive regulator of Hsp70 activity in vivo had not been demonstrated previously. Both constitutively expressed Hip as well as overexpressed Hip was found to be exclusively located in the cytoplasm (Ref. 8Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar and this report). This localization did not change during or after heat shock (not shown), unlike Hsp70 and Hsp40 that change their localization from mostly cytoplasmic before to merely nuclear after heat shock (29Ohtsuka K. Nakamura H. Sato C. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 1986; 2: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Welch W.J. Mizzen L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1117-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 31Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3095-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 32Hattori H. Kaneda T. Lokeshwar B. Laszlo A. Ohtsuka K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with its cytoplasmic localization, Hip enhanced refolding of the cytoplasmic but not nuclear luciferase. The effect was already seen when Hip was overexpressed alone, and coexpression with Hsp70 merely resulted in additive enhancement of luciferase refolding. In vitro, Hip was shown to be capable of binding directly to unfolded proteins and to prevent their aggregation (8Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 10Bruce B.D. Churchich J. Eur. J Biochem. 1997; 245: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As such, one could interpret the increase in cellular chaperone activity by Hip overexpression independent from Hsp70. However, deletion of the Hsp70-binding site of Hip without affecting its homo-oligomerization domain resulted in the loss of a Hip effect on luciferase refolding after heat shock. Although this mutant was never tested for its ability to prevent aggregation in vitro, the most likely explanation for observed effects of Hip in mammalian cells is that Hip requires a direct interaction with Hsp70 consistent with the situation in vitro (8Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 10Bruce B.D. Churchich J. Eur. J Biochem. 1997; 245: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this is supported by the finding that Bag-1, which competes with Hip for Hsp70 binding (see also below), inhibited the Hip-mediated increment in cellular chaperone activity. Since Hip also stimulated refolding in the absence of Hsp70 expression, it can be deduced that Hip is at least equally effective in stimulating refolding by Hsc70, which is constitutively expressed in the OT70 cells. By using a series of other Hip mutants, it was demonstrated that Hip oligomerization is also required for its action as a co-chaperone of Hsp70/Hsc70, whereas the last 110 carboxyl-terminal amino acids are not essential for this function. The amino acids 278–311 of Hip contain 7 imperfect GGMP repeats that are found in most cytoplasmic Hsc70s but not in Hsp70s (33Boorstein W.R. Ziegelhoffer T. Craig E.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The function of this motif is yet unclear, but from our in vivo data as well as from in vitro data (9Irmer H. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2230-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) it can be deduced that it is not involved in regulating Hsp70 chaperone activity. Furthermore, our data indicate that the very carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acids 316–368), which is structurally related to the Hop homologues Sti1p and human IEF SSP3521, is not required for regulating Hsp70 refolding activity. Our data on effects of chaperones on ATP depletion-induced protein damage revealed several new features. It seems plausible to assume that most if not all Hsp70s will be in the ADP-bound state under conditions of ATP depletion. This notion is supported by the fact that we could not detect a stimulating effect of Hsp40/Hdj-1 on the chaperone activity of Hsp70 in ATP-depleted cells. Hence, our data indicate that the ADP-bound Hsp70 can still act as a chaperone despite its lower substrate on rate (34Beissinger M. Buchner J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar). The data also imply that Hsp70 does not need to undergo cycling between the ATP and ADP states to protect against protein inactivation. This is consistent with the observation that mutant Hsp70s that lack their entire ATPase domain are still capable of protecting against proteotoxic damage (35Stege G.J. Li L. Kampinga H.H. Konings A.W. Li G.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finally, the finding that Hip is capable of stimulating the chaperone activity of Hsp70 under ATP-depleted conditions is consistent with the suggestion that Hip stabilizes the interaction of substrate with Hsp70 in its ADP-bound state. Indeed in vitro data showed that Hsc70 only binds to Hip immobilized on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns when preincubated with ADP but not ATP (8Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Also, Hip cannot associate with the Hsc70 mutant K71E, a mutant that cannot hydrolyze ATP (11Prapapanich V. Chen S. Nair S.C. Rimerman R.A. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 420-431PubMed Google Scholar, 28Prapapanich V. Chen S.Y. Smith D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 944-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For the in vivo situation, these data imply Hsp70 and Hip may be functional to combat the protein damage as it occurs during ischemic insults where cellular ATP levels severely drop. As both Hip and BAG-1 interact with the Hsp70 ATPase domain, we finally examined whether and how they may functionally compete in regulating the in vivo chaperone activity of Hsp70. In vitro data had already shown that Bag-1 binding to Hsp70 results in a displacement of the Hsp70 cofactors Hsp40, Hop, and Hip (15Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 16Hohfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 36Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6238-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,37Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) indicating that it acts dominantly over these other regulators. Indeed, we already demonstrated previously that physiological increases in the cellular level of Bag-1 inhibit the Hsp70-dependent chaperone activity in cells that constitutively express Hsp40 and Hip. This activity was seen for multiple isoforms of Bag-1 with molecular masses of 29, 33, 46, and 50 kDa that are expressed in cells as originating from different start codons (17Nollen E.A. Brunsting J.F. Song J. Kampinga H.H. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Here we used the 29-kDa isoform that is predominantly located in the nucleus but showed cytoplasmic localization and was capable of inhibiting the refolding of the heat-inactivated cytoplasmic luciferase (17Nollen E.A. Brunsting J.F. Song J. Kampinga H.H. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). By using HA-tagged proteins, we could transfect transiently with Bag-1 and Hip such that equal total levels of the proteins were expressed. With Hip being exclusively cytoplasmic, we therefore concluded that it was present in the cytoplasm in excess over Bag-1. Still, under these conditions we observed that Bag-1 could strongly diminish the refolding of heat-denatured cytoplasmic luciferase in the presence of excess Hip. Soin vivo, like in vitro, Hsp70 prefers association with Bag-1 in the presence of Hip, and we conclude that the effects of positive and negative regulators of Hsp70 can be reproduced in both systems yielding the same results. To what extent can we draw conclusions on the regulation of Hsp70 activity in dealing with stress-induced protein damage by overexpression of co-chaperones? Neither Hip nor BAG-1 are classical heat shock proteins as their levels are not induced in stressed cells, whereas Hsp70 and Hdj-1/Hsp40 are strongly induced and accumulate to high levels following heat shock or ATP depletion. Furthermore, the relative ratio of Hsp70 and co-chaperones changes within the cell due to the heat shock-induced translocation of Hsp70 and Hsp40 to the nucleus (29Ohtsuka K. Nakamura H. Sato C. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 1986; 2: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Welch W.J. Mizzen L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1117-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 31Pelham H.R.B.

Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the localization of Hip and Bag-1 remains unchanged (Ref. 7Michels A.A. Kanon B. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36757-36763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and data not shown). We previously showed that in hamster lung fibroblasts (O23 cells) elevated Hsp70 levels alone seemed to be sufficient to provide resistance toward cytoplasmic proteotoxicity comparable to that observed in pre-stressed cells. For the nuclear chaperone activity other factors seem to be required in addition to an increase in the level of Hsp70 to provide resistance comparable to that observed in pre-stressed O23 cells (21Nollen E.A. Brunsting J.F. Roelofsen H. Weber L.A. Kampinga H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2069-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, under normal conditions of cell growth and differentiation, the levels of Hip and Bag-1 vary among different tissue culture cell lines and tissues (38Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3116-3131PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the ultimate Hsp70 chaperone function both before and after stress could vary not only according to the total expression levels of Hsp70 but also to the levels of expression of the positive or negative co-chaperones, their affinity toward Hsp70, their cell-organelle-specific localization, and condition-mediated (re)distributions of the (co)chaperones. We thank Prof. Dr. R. I. Morimoto (Evanston, IL) for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2333761760,"A member of the small G protein family, cdc42, was isolated from a screen undertaken to identify p53-inducible genes during apoptosis in primary baby rat kidney (BRK) cells transformed with E1A and a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 using a PCR-based subtractive hybridization method. Cdc42 is a GTPase that belongs to the Rho/Rac subfamily of Ras-like GTPases. In response to external stimuli, Cdc42 is known to transduce signals to regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, induce DNA synthesis in quiescent fibroblasts, and promote apoptosis in neuronal and immune cells. In this study, we have demonstrated that cdc42 mRNA and protein were up-regulated in the presence of wild-type p53 in BRK cells, followed by cytoplasmic to plasma membrane translocation of Cdc42. Overexpression of Cdc42 in the presence of a dominant-negative mutant p53 induced apoptosis rapidly, indicating that Cdc42 functions downstream of p53. Furthermore, stable expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Cdc42 partially inhibited p53-mediated apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family members Bcl-xL, and the adenovirus protein E1B 19K, inhibited Cdc42-mediated apoptosis, whereas Bcl-2 did not. We provide evidence that PAK1 and JNK1 may play a role downstream of Cdc42 to transduce its apoptotic signal. Cdc42/PAK1 activates JNK1-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2, thereby inactivating its function, and that a phosphorylation resistant mutant (Bcl-2S70,87A,T56,74A) gains the ability to inhibit Cdc42- and p53-mediated apoptosis. Thus, one mechanism by which p53 promotes apoptosis is through activation of Cdc42 and inactivation of Bcl-2."

To investigate the pigment-binding activities of the proteins, chlorophyll b was for introduced the first time to a cyanobacterium that did not synthesize that pigment, and expression of its function in the native pigment-protein complex of cyanobacterium was confirmed by energy transfer. Arabidopsis CAO (chlorophylla oxygenase) cDNA was introduced into the genome ofSynechocystis sp. PCC6803. The transformant cells accumulated chlorophyll b, with the chlorophyllb content being in the range of 1.4 to 10.6% of the total chlorophyll depending on the growth phase. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the chlorophyll-protein complexes of transformant cells showed that chlorophyll b was incorporated preferentially into the P700-chlorophylla-protein complex (CP1). Furthermore, chlorophyllb in CP1 transferred light energy to chlorophylla, indicating a functional transformation. We also found that CP1 of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, believed to be a chlorophyll a protein, bound chlorophyll b with a chlorophyll b content of ∼4.4%. On the basis of these results, the evolution of pigment systems in an early stage of cyanobacterial development is discussed in this paper."

Incubation of human T cells with the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside, or the membrane-permeant cGMP analogs PET-cGMP and 8-pCPT-cGMP, activated cGK I and produced (i) a distinct pattern of phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, (ii) stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 and p38 kinase, and, upon anti-CD3 stimulation, (iii) inhibition of interleukin 2 release and (iv) inhibition of cell proliferation. cGK I was lost during in vitro culturing of primary T cells and was not detectable in transformed T cell lines. The proliferation of these cGK I-deficient cells was not inhibited by even high cGMP concentrations indicating that cGK I, but not cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases or channels, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, or other potential cGMP mediators, was responsible for inhibition of T cell proliferation. Consistent with this, overexpression of cGK Iβ, but not an inactive cGK Iβ mutant, restored cGMP-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation of Jurkat cells.

Activation and subsequent proliferation of resting T lymphocytes is an essential process in the T cell-mediated immune response.

Reports of cyclic nucleotide effects on T cell activation indicate that cAMP is inhibitory, whereas effects of cGMP have not been conclusively elucidated.

Our results demonstrate that primary human T cells contain endogenous cGK Iβ, which mediates inhibitory effects of cGMP on IL-2 production and proliferation. In contrast to the bulk of published studies, only freshly prepared cells were used for examining cGK I effects on T cells because our studies demonstrated that cGMP effects were absent in cGK I-deficient cultured cells; however, cGMP effects could be restored by transfection of these cells with cGK I. Anti-CD3-, CD4-, or CD8-conjugated Dynabeads used for affinity purification of T cells were purchased from Dynal (Hamburg, Germany). Stimulatory anti-CD3 antibodies were either 12F6, a kind gift from Johnson T. Wang (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA), or produced from the OKT3 hybridoma obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection. For flow cytometry, fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against CD2, CD3, CD14, and CD19 were obtained from Immunotech (Hamburg, Germany), against CD8 from Pharmingen (Hamburg, Germany), against CD4 from Exalpha (Boston, MA), and against CD41a from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL). Fluorochrome-conjugated isotype control antibodies were from Dako (Hamburg, Germany). SNP, 3-(5′-hydroxymethyl-2′furyl)-1-benzylindazol (YC-1), and forskolin were from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). cGMP analogs PET-cGMP and 8-pCPT-cGMP, as well as the cAMP analog Sp-5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate (cBIMPS) were from BioLog (Bremen, Germany). Jurkat-E6 cells were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection and A3.01 human T lymphoma cells from the Center for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA), fetal calf serum and cell culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc., nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell, and polyvinylene difluoride membranes from Millipore (Eschborn, Germany).

Antibodies against dual phosphorylated, activated MAP kinases, ERK1/2, and p38, as well as antibodies for total ERK1/2 and p38 were obtained from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). PBMC were isolated from freshly drawn heparinized human blood using Ficoll gradient centrifugation (31Heinkelein M. Sopper S. Jassoy C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6925-6931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. T cells were purified from PBMC using anti-CD3-conjugated Dynabeads, or CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were obtained by incubating PBMC with anti-CD4- or anti-CD8-conjugated Dynabeads at 4 °C for 1 h and then following the supplier's protocol. Affinity purification of T cells was performed using either fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against T cell antigens together with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (see below) or using T cell immunoaffinity columns and a protocol provided by Cedar Lane (Hornby, Canada) for negative-selection of T cells (removal of B cells and monocytes). Purified human platelets were prepared as described elsewhere (32Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For experiments, PBMC or purified T cells were incubated at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, or in the case of long term culturing (less than 2 weeks), in the same buffer except with 10% fetal calf serum plus 100 units/ml IL-2, and an initial addition of 100 ng/ml anti-CD3 antibody. PBMC were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD3 and anti-CD41a antibodies at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing to remove excess antibodies, cells were sorted to obtain pure T cells devoid of platelets (CD3+/CD41a−) separate from a T cell fraction with adherent platelets (CD3+/CD41a+). T cell purity was determined by distinguishing T cells from other cells, using fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies directed against cell-specific antigens such as CD2, CD4, CD8 (T cells), CD19 (B cells), CD14 (monocytes), and CD41a (platelets), Briefly, affinity-purified cells were incubated with a combination of up to three differently labeled antibodies at 4 °C for 1 h and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and analyzed using a FACScan cell sorter (Becton-Dickenson, Hamburg, Germany) together with LysisII and Cellquest software. Purified T cells contained at least 95% T lymphocytes, less than 2% monocytes or B cells, and either no detectable platelets (FACS-sorted cells) or less than 5% platelets (immunoaffinity column-purified cells). For FACS calibration purposes, fluorescein isothiocyanate- and phycoerythrin-labeled isotype-matched control antibodies were used. Total RNA was isolated from immunoaffinity column-purified T cells using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent and reverse transcription was performed with random hexamers using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit from MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany) according to the supplier's protocol. PCR amplification of cGK was performed using oligonucleotide primer pairs specific for each cGK I splice variant (cGK Iα-83 sense: 5′-GTCAGAGAAGGAGGAAGAAAT-3′ and cGK Iα-954 antisense: 5′-CAATCACAAGGCAGGTTACAG-3′, or cGK Iβ-69 sense: 5′-ATGGGCACCTTGCGGGATTTA-3′ and cGK Iβ-1269 antisense: 5′-TTTTGGATTCTTGACTTTTCA-3′, resulting in PCR products of 872 nucleotides (cGK Iα) and 1201 nucleotides (cGK Iβ), respectively. PCR amplification was performed using 40 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. In vitro cGK I activity was determined by analyzing VASP phosphorylation in cell lysates of affinity-purified T lymphocytes as well as platelets, following a previously published protocol (33Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified T cells were lysed in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mix (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and then lysates were passed through 25 gauge needles to shear chromosomal DNA.In vitro kinase reactions with cell lysates were carried out in buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 50 μm ATP), in the absence or presence of 0.5 μm PET-cGMP and 0.1 μg of purified recombinant dephospho-VASP, at 30 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, samples were processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of VASP phosphorylation as described below. In intact cell experiments, PBMC (preincubated at 37 °C for 3 h to overcome potential preactivation arising from handling during preparation) or platelets were resuspended in serum-free RPMI medium and stimulated in the absence or presence of agents that elevate cGMP or cAMP levels (see details under “Results” and in the figure legends) and briefly centrifuged to obtain cell pellets which were processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of VASP phosphorylation as described below. PBMC or purified T lymphocytes were incubated in serum-free RPMI medium for 3 h at 37 °C and then stimulated in the absence or presence of agents which elevate cGMP levels and briefly centrifuged to obtain cell pellets that were processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of phosphorylation as described below. Intact cells or cell lysates were added to SDS gel loading buffer and heated at 95 °C for 10 min, then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8% gels, for cGK I and VASP) and Western blotting. Western blot nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 1% hemoglobin in phosphate-buffered saline and divided horizontally to stain the high molecular weight range of proteins with polyclonal anti-cGK I antiserum (diluted 1:3000) and the lower range with monoclonal anti-phospho(Ser239)-VASP 16C2 antibodies (1 μg/ml), followed by either horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5000; Bio-Rad), respectively. Signals were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For determining ERK and p38 activation, stimulated cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (using 10% gels) and blotted to polyvinylene difluoride membranes, which were then blocked with TBST (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 3% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad). Signals were visualized with polyclonal antibodies that recognize activated dual phosphorylated ERK1/2 or dual phosphorylated p38, followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad). To determine total expression of MAP kinase for verification of equal protein loading, membranes were stripped at 58 °C for 1 h in buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS and then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) and incubated with anti-ERK1/2 or anti-p38 phosphorylation-independent antibodies, followed by ECL detection (data not shown). PBMC (2 × 105/well of 24-well plates) were incubated with or without agents that elevate cAMP or cGMP levels, at 37 °C for 1 h under serum-free conditions prior to adding anti-CD3 antibody (12F6 or OKT3, diluted 1:2500), alone or together with anti-CD28 antibody (0.1 μg/ml), and incubating in 10% serum-containing medium for analysis of proliferation after 5 days. Subsequently, PBMC were counted using a Cell Counter (Coulter, Krefeld, Germany), and the inhibition of anti-CD3 antibody-induced cell proliferation caused by cAMP or cGMP analogs or SNP was determined. Jurkat E6.1 cells (5 × 105/ml) were cotransfected with pCMV-cGK Iβ (34Meinecke M. Geiger J. Butt E. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Chakraborty T. Walter U. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar) or with pCMV-cGK Iβ-K405A mutant (35Smolenski A. Poller W. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25723-25732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and pCMV-EGFP (kindly provided by S. Schneider-Rasp) at a ratio of 3:2; using Fugene-6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 16 h of transfection, cells were seeded at a density of 200,000 cells/well and subsequently incubated for 72 h in the presence of various concentrations of 8-pCPT-cGMP. Using flow cytometry, the impact of cGK I expression and activation with 8-pCPT-cGMP on Jurkat cell proliferation was determined. In the presence of 8-pCPT-cGMP, the ratio of green fluorescent cells (e.g. containing cGK I and EGFP) to nonfluorescent cells was calculated and divided by the same ratio for cells exposed to medium only (non-8-pCPT-cGMP treated cells). This gave a Jurkat proliferation ratio which was converted to percent. PBMC cultured in triplicate at 3 × 106/ml (24-well plate) in RPMI 1640/10% fetal calf serum were stimulated with anti-CD3 (1:2500) in the presence of various concentrations of 8-pCPT-cGMP. After 48 h of stimulation, cell supernatants were collected, and IL-2 concentrations were determined using the OPTEIA IL-2 set according to the supplier's protocol (BD/Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany). A rich source of cGK I in human blood is platelets that can easily contaminate crude lymphocyte preparations. Therefore, for examining the expression of cGK in T lymphocytes, it was crucial to use highly purified cells (Fig.1 A). T cells were prepared from freshly isolated PBMC using anti-CD3-conjugated Dynabeads or were isolated from PBMC by labeling with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD3 and anti-CD41a (platelet-specific marker) and using FACS to separate pure T cells devoid of platelets (CD3+/CD41a−) from T cells with adherent platelets (CD3+/CD41a+). Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-cGK I antibody (Fig. 1 A) detected cGK I in unsorted as well as both of the FACS-sorted T cell fractions, indicating that T cells devoid of platelets (CD41a−) indeed contain endogenous cGK I. To estimate the abundance of cGK I expression in T cells, signal intensities from FACS-sorted T cells were compared with those observed in increasing amounts of platelet extracts with a known content of cGK I (38.1 ± 3.9 pmol cGK I/109 platelets, equivalent to 3 ng of cGK I protein/106 cells (32Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). T cell-specific cGK I expression was estimated at ∼5 ng/106 T cells (Fig.1 A). Anti-CD8+- and anti-CD4+-conjugated Dynabeads used to purify T cell subsets (with less than 5% contaminating platelets; data not shown) demonstrated endogenous cGK I expression in both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Fig.1 B). However, transformed T cell lines (Jurkat-E6 or A3.01) contained no detectable cGK I, and that observed in primary T cell cultures was lost after 48 h of culture (Fig. 1, B andC, respectively). None of the T cells investigated (freshly isolated, cultured, or transformed) expressed detectable cGK II by either Western or PCR analysis (data not shown). The cGK I isoform expressed in T cells was identified by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of RNA derived from immunoaffinity column-purified T cells using cGK Iα and cGK Iβ specific primer pairs (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1 D, only the cGK Iβ splice variant was detected in human T cells. Evidence that the band identified by Western blot analysis as cGK I in fresh T cells indeed demonstrated that cGK activity was obtained by studying cGK I phosphorylation of the endogenous substrate VASP in lysates of T cells (affinity-purified using anti-CD3-conjugated Dynabeads) in response to 0.5 μm PET-cGMP, a hydrolysis resistant, cGK-selective cGMP analog (Fig.2). VASP phosphorylation was determined by Western blot analysis using the anti-phospho(Ser239)-VASP antibody 16C2, which detects a 46-kDa VASP phosphorylated on Ser239, as well as a 50-kDa VASP phosphorylated on both Ser239 and Ser157(30Smolenski A. Bachmann C. Reinhard K. Honig-Liedl P. Jarchau T. Hoschuetzky H. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20029-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The signal for VASP phosphorylation obtained from fresh T cell extracts (Fig. 2 A, fourth lane) was less prominent in comparison with that from an equal amount of platelet extract (Fig. 2 C, fourth lane). This appeared to be in part due to lower VASP levels in T cells (determined using a phosphorylation-independent antibody which recognizes total VASP; data not shown), and the signal in fresh T cells could be increased by adding exogenous purified recombinant VASP (Fig. 2 A, comparefourth lane with sixth lane), which is isolated primarily in the de-phospho form (Fig. 2 A, secondand fifth lanes). The exogenously added dephospho-VASP ensured saturating amounts of substrate and increased the sensitivity of the in vitro kinase assay in T cells (Fig. 2 A,sixth lane). In contrast to freshly purified T cells, T cells from the same donor cultured for 10 days in vitro no longer demonstrated PET-cGMP-stimulated VASP phosphorylation activity (Fig. 2 B). The stimulation of VASP phosphorylation by cGMP-elevating agents was also demonstrated in intact PBMC (Western blots; Fig.3). After 25 min of stimulation, VASP phosphorylation in PBMC in response to 200 μm PET-cGMP, a membrane-permeant, hydrolysis-resistant, cGK-selective cGMP analog, and in response to 100 μm SNP, a NO donor, was markedly less than VASP phosphorylation in platelets (Fig. 3, A andB, respectively, showing analysis of equal amounts of protein), as had also been observed in cell lysates above. Examination of a detailed time course of SNP stimulation revealed that peak VASP phosphorylation occurred transiently after 5 min SNP and then rapidly declined (Fig. 3 B), unlike the SNP stimulation in platelets that persisted throughout 2 h. YC-1 (50 μm), a nitric oxide-independent activator of guanylate cyclase and an inhibitor of several phosphodiesterases, caused strong and long lasting stimulation of VASP phosphorylation in PBMC (Fig. 3). SNP plus YC-1 treatment produced somewhat more VASP phosphorylation than YC-1 alone. cBIMPS, a selective activator of cAK, also strongly stimulated VASP phosphorylation in PBMC and platelets. Whereas the cBIMPS stimulatory effect was preserved in cultured PBMC, none of the effects of cGMP-elevating agents were preserved (Fig. 3 A), indicating that their effects were lost along with cGK I and could not be mediated by cAK. Stimulation of purified T cells with 200 μm PET-cGMP or 8-pCPT-cGMP or with 100 μm SNP caused dual phosphorylation/activation of both ERK and p38 over a time period of 5–60 min (Western blot; Fig.4 A), with peak activation between 10 and 15 min. Induction of both ERK- and p38-phosphorylation by 8-pCPT-cGMP for 15 min was dose-dependent (Fig.4 B). Proliferation of smooth muscle cells and other cGK I positive cells is inhibited by cGMP analogs (see “Discussion”). Because cAMP is a known inhibitor of T cell proliferation, stimulators of cGMP/cGK were compared with the cAMP analog cBIMPS with regard to their effects on proliferation of TCR·CD3-activated PBMC (Fig. 5; note that cell number increase is shown in A, percentage of control proliferation in the absence of inhibitor in B–D). cBIMPS (200 μm) abolished CD3-activated T cell proliferation, whereas 200 μm PET-cGMP (or 8-pCPT-cGMP) and 100 μm SNP inhibited proliferation about 50, 40, and 70%, respectively, in freshly prepared PBMC (Fig. 5, A andB) shown to contain cGK I (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). In cultured PBMC (cultured for 3 days prior to the proliferation assay) that have lost cGK I, the inhibitory effect of cBIMPS was highly preserved; however, no inhibition by 8-pCPT-cGMP was observed, and inhibition by"

A phospho-specific monoclonal antibody to the C-terminal Ser315phospho-epitope was used to determine whether phosphorylation of endogenous p53 at Ser315 can be detected in vivo, whether steady-state Ser315 phosphorylation increases or decreases in an irradiated cell, and whether this phosphorylation event activates or inhibits p53 in vivo. A native phospho-specific IgG binding assay was developed for quantitating the extent of p53 phosphorylation at Ser315 where one, two, three, or four phosphates/tetramer could be defined after in vitro phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent protein kinases. Using this assay, near-stoichiometric Ser315 phosphorylation of endogenous p53 protein was detected in vivo after UV irradiation of MCF7 and A375 cells, coinciding with elevated p53-dependent transcription. Transfection of the p53 gene with an alanine mutation at the Ser315 site into Saos-2 cells gave rise to a form of p53 protein with a substantially reduced specific activity as a transcription factor. The treatment of cells with the cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor Roscovitine promoted a reduction in the specific activity of endogenous p53 or ectopically expressed p53. These results indicate that the majority of p53 protein has been phosphorylated at Ser315 after irradiation damage and identify a cyclin-dependent kinase pathway that plays a role in stimulating p53 function. p53 protein activity as a transcription factor can be activated in vivo by antibodies that target its C-terminal negative regulatory domain suggesting that cellular enzymes that target this domain may play a role in stimulating p53-dependent gene expression.

Activation of p53-induced growth arrest or apoptosis is a key end point to the signal transduction pathways induced by many distinct forms of cellular damaging agents, including ionizing and nonionizing radiation (1Kastan M.B.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3199-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The biochemical activity of p53 most tightly linked to its biological function involves its ability to bind to DNA sequence-specifically (8el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar) and to function as a transcription factor (9Pietenpol J.A. Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. el-Deiry W.S. Kinzler K.W.

Each of these domains on p53 contain multiple sites for modification by both covalent and noncovalent interactions, and it now seems likely that it is the combined action of many enzymes that coordinately modulate p53-dependent gene expression in response to cellular stress. Given that 2-fold changes in the gene dosage of p53 can have dramatic affects on tumor incidence in vivo (20Venkatachalam S. Shi Y.P. Jones S.N. Vogel H. Bradley A. Pinkel D. Donehower L.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4657-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 21Tyner S.D. Choi J. Laucirica R. Ford R.J. Donehower L.A. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 24: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it seems evident that these post-translational events modulating the specific activity of p53 will play an important role in regulating its tumor suppressor function. The N-terminal regulatory domain of p53 contains a highly conserved 15-amino acid domain that directs the binding of p53 to the positive effector p300 or the inhibitor MDM2, the balance of which modulates p53-dependent tumor suppression (22Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Ball K.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The regulation of the p53-p300 interaction is modulated in part by phosphorylation within the BOX-I domain, as p300/CBP binding to p53 in the N terminus and subsequent acetylation of the C-terminal domain of p53 can be stimulated by Ser15 phosphorylation within the p300 docking site (23Lambert P.F.

These studies identified one key signal transduction cascade that could stimulate p53-dependent transcription via modification of the N-terminal domain of p53. Two other sites of post-translational modification are now known to be clustered within this BOX-I regulatory domain, with a similar paradigm being supported: phosphorylation of p53 within the N-terminal BOXI domain at Thr18 or Ser20 can destabilize the p53-MDM2 complex or stabilize p53-p300 protein interactions (31Craig A.L.

Cycling human cells with a wild-type p53 pathway constitutively modify p53 at the Ser20 site (35Bond J.A. Webley K. Wyllie F.S. Jones C.J. Craig A. Hupp T. Wynford-Thomas D.

Flanking the tetramerization domain of p53 in the extreme C terminus is a negative regulatory domain whose post-translational modification also plays an important role in modulating the specific activity of p53in vivo. One function for this regulatory C-terminal domain is to maintain p53 protein in a latent state for specific DNA binding. Deletion of this domain or stoichiometric phosphorylation at Ser392 activates the latent specific DNA binding function of p53 in vitro by an allosteric mechanism (14Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Increased steady-state phosphorylation at Ser392 of endogenous human p53 protein in cells occurs following UV-C and X irradiation damage (42Blaydes J.P. Craig A.L. Wallace M. Ball M.L. Traynor N. Gibbs N. Hupp T.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3829-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but whether CK2, PKR or other enzymes catalyze this reaction is not yet known (43Blaydes J.P. Hupp T.R.

In addition, microinjection or intracellular synthesis of an antibody (pAb421) that binds to the C-terminal negative regulatory domain near the phosphorylation sites can activate p53-dependent gene expression in vivo (46Abarzua P. LoSardo J.E. Gubler M.L. Neri A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3490-3494PubMed Google Scholar, 47Abarzua P. LoSardo J.E. Gubler M.L. Spathis R. Lu Y.A. Felix A. Neri A.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that C-terminal modification can be a rate-limiting step in stimulating p53 function in vivo. Together, these data provide the basis for the paradigm that a signaling pathway modulating the specific activity of p53 after cellular damage targets the C-terminal negative regulatory domain by stimulating the latent specific DNA binding function of the p53. Other enzymes that are now known to target sites within the C-terminal domains of p53 and stimulate its specific DNA binding function have also been suggested to play a coordinated role in the damage response, including increases in steady-state acetylation at Lys320 and/or Lys382 by p300/CBP (16Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) and increases in SUMOylation at Lys386 (17Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). One site of phosphorylation in the C terminus for which a role in the stress-induced activation of p53 has not been defined is the cyclin-dependent kinase site at Ser315. Conventional mapping techniques have shown that the highly conserved Ser315 site is phosphorylated in cells using conventional [32P]orthophosphate labeling methods and is a goodin vitro substrate for the G2 and S phase cyclin-dependent kinases (49Bischoff J.R.

Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p53 at this site has been shown to significantly enhance the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of p53 protein in vitro (50Wang Y. Prives C. Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 51Fuchs B. Hecker D. Scheidtmann K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), possibly by cooperating with other modifications within the extreme C-terminal negative regulatory domain (52Hansen S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30922-30928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or by alternate N-terminal modifications (53Hecker D. Page G. Lohrum M. Weiland S. Scheidtmann K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 953-961PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, biophysical studies have shown that phosphorylation at the Ser315 site reverses the stabilizing and activating effects of Ser392phosphorylation on tetramer formation (54Sakaguchi K. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Anderson C.W. Erickson J.W. Appella E. Xie D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10117-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Elevated phosphorylation at the cdk/cdc phosphorylation site induced by okadaic acid treatment of cells increased the specific activity of p53 as a DNA-binding protein from the mdm2 or p21 waf1 promoters but reduced activity from the cyclin G promoter (55Lohrum M. Scheidtmann K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2527-2539PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation site of rat p53, Ser313, to alanine also had differential affects on reducing or increasing the specific activity of ectopically expressed rat p53 from distinct promoters (55Lohrum M. Scheidtmann K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2527-2539PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that the Ser315 site phosphorylation can have an inhibitory or a stimulatory role in modulating p53-dependent transcription, depending upon the context. Given the central role played by the cyclin-dependent kinases in the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle and the evidence indicating that Ser315 modification of p53 can be inactivating or activating, we set out to further investigate the role played by phosphorylation of endogenous p53 protein at Ser315 in cells with a wild-type p53 pathway. Standard radiolabeling techniques used to monitor phosphorylation in cells actually perturbs the base-line phosphorylation-status of p53 and induces a p53-dependent growth arrest and will therefore alter cyclin-dependent kinase activity (35Bond J.A. Webley K. Wyllie F.S. Jones C.J. Craig A. Hupp T. Wynford-Thomas D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3788-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we have utilized a noninvasive approach to dissect signaling to Ser315 and to begin to address the role of cyclin-dependent kinases in the regulation of p53 function. A phospho-specific monoclonal antibody to Ser315 has been generated and characterized to demonstrate that phosphorylation of endogenous human p53 in MCF7 and A375 cells at Ser315 is near-stoichiometric after cellular irradiation. Mutation of the Ser315 phosphorylation site on p53 to alanine reduces the specific activity of p53 as a transcription factor in vivo, and the use of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor Roscovitine reduces the specific activity of wild-type p53in vivo. These data identify a regulatory site in which the phosphorylation stoichiometry of endogenous p53 protein is establishedin vivo and link enhanced Ser315 phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent protein kinase pathway to an increase in the specific activity of p53 as a DNA-binding protein and transcription factor in vivo.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay wells were coated with purified FPS315 and used to select bacteriophage from libraries containing random peptides inserted within the phage III coat protein according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). Two separate libraries were screened: PhD12 contains random linear 12mer peptides, whereas C7C contains 7-mer cyclic peptides, the structure of which is constrained by a disulfide bridge between two cysteine residues at either end of the insert peptide.

Thus, shedding of PS-expressing microvesicles appears to be closely associated with cell surface externalization of PS (11Zwaal R.F.A. Schroit A.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exposure of PS is a key step for the hemostatic response (11Zwaal R.F.A. Schroit A.J.

Nevertheless, little information regarding the upstream and downstream intracellular signals leading to PS externalization or phospholipid scrambling has been provided. Although several hypotheses have been proposed regarding direct or indirect coupling mechanisms of the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane (17Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) suggested that SOCE is mediated by actin cytoskeleton in human platelets. To examine the significance of SOCE on PS externalization, we have combined the detection of PS exposure and the measurement of [Ca2+]i in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, a megakaryoblastic cell line expressing specific receptors found in platelets (20Fujimoto T.

Factor V was purchased from Diagnostica Stago (Asnières, France) and chromogenic substrate H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroaniline-dihydrochloride (Chromozyme TH) from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). HEL cells constitute a continuous megakaryoblastic cell line expressing markers such as thrombopoietin, thrombin receptors, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, with some of them being found in platelets (24Vittet D. Mathieu M.N. Launay J.M. Chevillard C. Exp. Hematol. 1992; 20: 1129-1134PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jennings L.K. Slack S.M. Wall C.D. Mondoro T.H. Blood Cells Mol.

HEL were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml and cultured in RPMI 1640 (free Ca2+ concentration = 0.4 mm) supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate (1 mm), gentamicin (20 μg/ml), and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. All experiments were performed with maximal concentrations of inhibitors at which no cytotoxicity was observed. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 600 ×g for 5 min, washed once in Hanks' balanced salt solution, and resuspended at the concentration of 1 × 105cells/ml. Cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 3 and 10 μm SKF-96365 or 10 μm miconazole and for 30 min with 10 μm CytD. Cells were then stimulated with 2 μm ionophore A23187 for 10 min at 37 °C, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min to separate the microparticle-containing supernatant from the corresponding cells. Procoagulant PS exposure in stimulated cells and derived microparticles was detected, in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, using a human prothrombinase assay in which this phospholipid is the rate-limiting parameter promoting the activation of prothrombin by factor Xa in the presence of factor Va (27Connor J. Bucana C. Fidler I.J. Schroit A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3184-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thrombin generated by the assembled prothrombinase complex was measured using a chromogenic assay, as described elsewhere (23Kunzelmann-Marche C. Satta N. Toti F. Zhang Y. Nawroth P.P. Morrissey J.H. Freyssinet J.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 83: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). HEL cells were used at 106 cells/ml. They were loaded with 3 μm Fluo-3 for 30 min at room temperature and then washed twice in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with CaCl2 (final Ca2+ concentration ∼ 1 mm) and resuspended at the same concentration (106 cells/ml, 500 μl/analysis). To study Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry separately, the experiments were performed in the presence of EGTA (1 mm), able to chelate the totality of Ca2+ in RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were then stimulated by the different agents, and CaCl2 was added to restore an extracellular Ca2+ concentration of ∼1 mm, allowing capacitative Ca2+ entry. Fluo-3 fluorescence was monitored using a FACScan Becton-Dickinson flow cytometer and the CELLQuest software. A baseline value was obtained for each sample by fluorescence measurement for 30 s before addition of pharmacologic agents. Collection was immediately resumed, then terminated after additional 5 min (∼50,000 events). Fluo-3 fluorescence was expressed in arbitrary fluorescence intensity units and plotted as FL-1 versus time. To convert these values into absolute [Ca2+]i, calibration was performed at the end of each experiment. [Ca2+]i was calculated using the equation: [Ca2+]i =K d[(F −F min)/(F max −F)], where K d is the dissociation constant of the Ca2+·Fluo-3 complex (400 nm) (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). F max represents the maximum fluorescence (obtained by treating cells with 10 μm A23187), andF min corresponds to the minimum fluorescence (obtained for ionophore-treated cells in the presence of 1 mm EGTA). F is the actual sample fluorescence. Fluorescence intensities were expressed as the increase in fluorescence with respect to baseline fluorescence intensity before stimulation. PS probing was achieved using annexin VFITC (140 nm final concentration). Incubation at room temperature was allowed to proceed for 10 min before data acquisition. In some cases, cells were activated in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 with 2 μmCa2+ ionophore A23187 for 10 min at 37 °C before addition of annexin VFITC. In another set of experiments, cell-derived microparticles were separated from activated cells by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Under this condition, 100% of cells were eliminated as well as the larger cell fragments. Annexin VFITC wad added to the microparticle-containing supernatant. Samples were analyzed using the FACScan flow cytometer. The forward light scatter and fluorescence channels were set at logarithmic gains. The forward light scatter setting was E-01. The identification of cell and microparticle populations was performed as previously already described (29Satta N. Toti F. Feugeas O. Bohbot A. Dachary-Prigent J. Eschwege V. Hedman H. Freyssinet J.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3245-3255PubMed Google Scholar). Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least four separate experiments performed at different culture stages and/or passages, with no obvious difference attributable to the culture conditions. Paired Student's t test was used for the statistical analysis. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. To investigate the changes of [Ca2+]i, HEL cells were loaded with the Ca2+-binding fluorophore Fluo-3, and emission fluorescence shifts were monitored by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig.1, stimulation by the Ca2+-ionophore A23187 evoked Ca2+ signal with two characteristic phases: a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i within a few seconds, followed by a sustained phase of elevated [Ca2+]i lasting several minutes, which resembles Ca2+ entry. To determine whether this sustained Ca2+ phase reflected Ca2+ entry, cells were treated with SKF-96365, an agent known to block store-operated Ca2+ channels (30Merritt J.E. Armstrong W.P. Benham C.D. Hallam T.J. Jacob R. Jaxa-Chamiec A. Leigh B.K. McCarthy S.A. Moores K.E. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) and other Ca2+ channels. SKF-96365 by itself significantly increased (p < 0.05) basal fluorescence intensity, [Ca2+]i basal values being 43 ± 5 nm, 87 ± 10, and 103 ± 27 nm in the absence and in the presence of 3 and 10 μm SKF-96365, respectively. At 1 μm, SKF-96365 did not significantly modify Ca2+ response induced by calcium ionophore A23187 (Table I). As illustrated in Fig. 1, SKF-96365 treatment reduced the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i sustained phase in HEL cells stimulated with A23187 in the presence of external Ca2+ in the medium (∼1 mm). SKF-96365 was responsible for a dose-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ entry between 3 and 10 μm, with reductions of ∼13 and 20%, respectively (Table I). Above 10 μm SKF-96365, cytotoxicity precluded further observations (not shown).Table IA23187-induced Ca2+ response in HEL cellsCa2+ entry inhibitorsA23187-induced response%SKF-96365 (1 μm)110.07 ± 7.87SKF-96365 (3 μm)87.27 ± 3.661-ap <0.05;SKF-96365 (10 μm)79.80 ± 5.631-ap <0.05;LaCl3 (30 μm)81.32 ± 2.631-bp <0.01; response of cells treated with Ca2+ entry inhibitors versus A23187-stimulated cells in the absence of inhibitors.Miconazole (10 μm)85.29 ± 4.311-bp <0.01; response of cells treated with Ca2+ entry inhibitors versus A23187-stimulated cells in the absence of inhibitors.Cells were preincubated with the Ca2+ entry inhibitors SKF-96365 (1, 3, and 10 μm), LaCl3 (30 μm), or miconazole (10 μm) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 in the external medium and activated with 2 μm A23187.

Results are expressed as percentage of the A23187-induced Ca2+ response ± S.E. in the absence of inhibitors, which was 378 ± 33 arbitrary fluorescence units. Data are representative of four to six experiments. In platelets, A23187 has been reported to induce Ca2+release from intracellular stores, and after sustained depletion, voltage-independent Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane becomes activated (7Pasquet J.M. Dachary-Prigent J. Nurden A.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To confirm which is the pathway affected by SKF-96365 in HEL cells, the same experiments were repeated in the presence of LaCl3, an inhibitor of divalent cationic channels (31Aussel C. Marhaba R. Pelassy C. Breittmayer J.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and miconazole, an imidazole compound able to inhibit SOCE (32Koch B.D. Faurot G.F. Kopanitsa M.V. Swinney D.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). No significant difference was detected in the basal fluorescence intensity after LaCl3 treatment ([Ca2+]i basal values were 43 ± 6 and 48 ± 12 nm, in the absence and in the presence of LaCl3, respectively). However, miconazole increased significantly (p < 0.05) the basal fluorescence intensity ([Ca2+]i basal value was 76 ± 10 nm). As illustrated in Table I, LaCl3 (30 μm) or miconazole (10 μm) treatment reduced Ca2+ entry by ∼20 and 15%, respectively. Collectively, these data suggest that the sustained phase of elevated [Ca2+]i induced by A23187 in HEL cells is due to SOCE activation. In the absence of stimulation (Fig.2 A), HEL cells and the corresponding supernatants showed a basal PS-dependent prothrombinase activity of 0.01 ± 0.005 and 0.02 ± 0.008 NIH units of thrombin generated per min/ml/2 × 105cells, respectively. Following treatment with 3 and 10 μmSKF-96365, these activities increased ∼2-fold, testifying to a weak ability of this agent to perturb PS asymmetric distribution by itself. After Ca2+ ionophore treatment, prothrombinase activity was ∼12-fold and ∼3.5-fold enhanced in cells and corresponding supernatants, respectively. SKF-96365 significantly (p< 0.05) affected the development of prothrombinase activity induced by Ca2+ ionophore with an inhibition of ∼40 and 48% in the presence of 3 and 10 μm SKF-96365, respectively. The same behavior was observed in the corresponding supernatants. Prothrombinase activity measurements were also performed in the presence of LaCl3 and miconazole. LaCl3interfered in this assay, probably because it was able to form a coordinate complex with PS (33Petersheim M. Sun J. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 631-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), making the latter inaccessible for the assembly of the coagulation factors at the cell surface. As shown in Fig. 2 B, miconazole also decreased the development of prothrombinase activity induced by A23187 in HEL cells; however, the inhibition (34%, p < 0.05) was lower than that observed with 10 μm SKF-96365. Prothrombinase activity was reduced accordingly in the corresponding supernatants. To establish whether microparticles from HEL cells released after A23187 treatment bear exposed PS at their surface, cells and/or corresponding supernatants were incubated with annexin VFITC, a widely used probe for PS (Fig.3). Unstimulated HEL cells presented a basal level of fluorescence concerning ∼75% of the cells (Fig.3 B, upper left region), testifying to the probable weak binding of annexin VFITC to various membrane components, including phospholipids other than PS, because interaction may be favored in the presence of Ca2+ at concentration as high as 1 mm (34Andree H.A.M. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Hauptmann R. Hemker H.C. Hermens W.T. Willems G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4923-4928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining ∼25% of events in theupper right region of Fig. 3 B likely represents spontaneously activated and/or apoptotic cells expressing a proportion of PS at their surface, with the corresponding PS-positive (i.e. annexin VFITC-positive) microparticle population in the lower right region of Fig. 3 E. In agreement with prothrombinase assay (Figs. 2 A,2 B, and 4 C), A23187 induced extensive PS exposure in cells (Fig. 3 C), as shown by the marked shift of ∼99% of the cells to the upper right region, i.e. that of the highest fluorescence intensities. This was indeed also the case for microparticle shedding (Fig. 3 F), as evidenced by the large proportion of annexin VFITC-positive events in the lower right region(91 ± 2%). Hence, microparticles virtually stemming from activated cells bear accessible PS and are therefore procoagulant.Figure 4Effect of SKF-96365 on TG-evoked Ca2+ response.

It has to be emphasized that SKF-96365 reduced the amplitude of the sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i observed in TG-stimulated cells.

Under these conditions, the addition of 1 μm TG to Fluo-3-loaded cells evoked a transient and slow elevation in [Ca2+]i due to the release of Ca2+ from internal stores. Subsequent reintroduction of 1 mm CaCl2 in the external medium induced a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, indicative of SOCE. At 1 μm, SKF-96365 had no effect on CaCl2-evoked response in TG-exposed cells (not shown). Relative to controls, the magnitude of SOCE upon CaCl2addition was significantly reduced (∼20%) in 3 or 10 μm SKF-96365-treated cells after stimulation with 1 μm TG (Fig. 4, A and B). As shown above with SKF-96365, both LaCl3 and miconazole did not affect Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (Table II). After CaCl2reintroduction, these inhibitors were able to significantly reduce SOCE (∼19 and 12%, respectively).Table IIEffect of LaCl3, and miconazole on TG-evoked Ca2+ entryCa2+ entry inhibitorsTG-induced responseTG/CaCl2-evoked response%LaCl3 (30 μm)85.24 ± 7.3580.92 ± 4.492-ap <0.05.Miconazole (10 μm)92.05 ± 7.2188.55 ± 3.982-ap <0.05.Cells were preincubated for 15 min with LaCl3 (30 μm) or miconazole (10 μm) in the presence of EGTA in the external medium, then stimulated with 1 μmTG and subsequent reintroduction of CaCl2 (∼1 mm, final concentration).

Data are representative of four to seven experiments. HEL cells were preincubated with 10 μmCytD, a widely used membrane-permeant inhibitor of actin polymerization, which binds to the barbed end of actin filaments (35Fox J.E.B. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1981; 292: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, basal values of [Ca2+]iwere 50 ± 5 and 133 ± 34 nm, in the absence and in the presence of CytD, respectively, but this difference was not statistically significant. CytD reduced A23187-induced Ca2+signal by ∼20% (Fig. 5 A). As illustrated in Fig. 5 B, in the presence of EGTA, CytD reduced TG-evoked Ca2+ signal (by 32%, p< 0.05), indicating that Ca2+ stores are affected by the inhibition of actin polymerization. In addition, CytD reduced CaCl2-evoked response in TG-exposed cells (by 21%,p < 0.01). Fig. 5 C shows the effect of CytD on PS externalization at the HEL cell membrane surface. CytD by itself did not significantly modify prothrombinase activity. However, CytD treatment reduced A23187-induced PS exposure by 38% (p < 0.05), suggesting that PS transmembrane movements are, at least in part, modulated by actin polymerization. The decrease of prothrombinase activity in the corresponding supernatants was weaker. The present study provides evidence that PS externalization is related to Ca2+ entry in HEL cells, and more specifically to a particular way of Ca2+ entry, referred to as SOCE. In addition, we show that both events, SOCE and PS exposure, are regulated, at least in part, by actin cytoskeleton. Like platelets and many other nonexcitable cells (5Sage S.O. Reast R. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 36Sargeant P. Sage S.O. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 395-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), HEL cells undergo SOCE, as observed here after CaCl2-induced response in TG-treated cells. Three common inhibitors of SOCE, SKF-96365, LaCl3, and miconazole (30Merritt J.E. Armstrong W.P. Benham C.D. Hallam T.J. Jacob R. Jaxa-Chamiec A. Leigh B.K. McCarthy S.A. Moores K.E. Rink T.J.

Life Sci. 1999; 65: 2513-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), partially inhibited capacitative Ca2+ entry in HEL cells without affecting Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. At the actual concentrations used, miconazole inhibited less efficiently A23187- and TG-induced Ca2+ entry compared with SKF-96365 and LaCl3. However, in several other studies (37Jan C.R. Tseng C.J. Life Sci. 1999; 65: 2513-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 38Jayadev S. Petranka J.G. Cheran S.K. Biermann J.A. Barrett J.C. Murphy E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8261-8268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it has been observed that the inhibitory effect of these compounds differs in magnitude depending on the cell type and concentration. Little is known about the intracellular signals leading to PS externalization. Our results from the present and previous (16Martı́nez M.C. Martin S. Toti F. Fressinaud E. Dachary-Prigent J. Meyer D. Freyssinet J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10092-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) studies strongly suggest that an alteration of SOCE is correlated with a reduced PS exposure. Indeed, Ca2+ entry inhibitors, SKF-96365 and miconazole, which inhibit store-operated Ca2+channels, are also able to significantly reduce PS exposure. Ca2+ entry inhibitors also reduced prothrombinase activity in the supernatants, suggesting a Ca2+ dependence for microvesicle release. These inhibitors were deliberately used at low concentration to prevent artificial perturbation of the lipid organization in the plasma membrane, because this may happen in the presence of membrane-binding molecules (8Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). After stimulation, HEL cells and microparticles were both strongly labeled by annexin VFITC, confirming that a major fraction of microparticles bore exposed PS (91 ± 2%). Similar results were obtained in platelets (10Dachary-Prigent J. Pasquet J.M. Freyssinet J.M. Nurden A.T.

Chem. 1990; 265: 3809-3814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that most if not all shed vesicles express PS at their surface and may therefore disseminate membrane-associated procoagulant activity. The actin microfilaments of the cytoskeleton form a complex network, providing the structural basis for simultaneous interactions between multiple cellular structures. For example, the actin-based cytoskeleton is involved in the control of ion channel activity across the plasma membrane of different cell types (43Schwiebert E.M. Mills J.W. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7081-7089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Maximov A.V. Vedernikova E.A. Hinssen H. Khaitlina S.Y. Negulyaev Y.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present study, CytD treatment inhibited A23187-induced Ca2+ responses and both Ca2+ release and entry evoked by TG. Similar observations have been reported in astrocytes after agonist stimulation, suggesting that disruption of microfilaments inhibits receptor/Gi-protein interaction (45Sergeeva M. Ubl J.J. Reiser G. Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, here we can exclude this hypothesis, because HEL cells were stimulated by two agents, A23187 and TG, involving distinct signaling pathways. It is likely that the cytoskeleton regulates Ca2+ signaling at different stages of Ca2+ release and SOCE. In addition, the results concerning the effect of CytD on Ca2+ release and/or Ca2+ entry are conflicting. Ribeiro et al. (46Ribeiro C.M. Reece J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26555-26561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and Patterson et al. (47Patterson R.L. vanRossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) have observed that CytD did not block TG-induced Ca2+ entry in NIH 3T3 or smooth muscle cells, respectively. Other authors have observed that CytD did not alter the agonist-induced Ca2+ release in vascular endothelial cells, but Ca2+ entry was reduced (48Holda J.R. Blatter L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, in human platelets, Ca2+ stores released by TG were not affected by CytD, but SOCE was greatly reduced by cytoskeletal depolymerization (19Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These discrepancies are probably related to a wide variability in the cytoskeletal intrinsic properties as a function of the cell type. Thus, the fact that cytoskeleton disruption attenuates A23187- and TG-induced Ca2+ release and entry in HEL cells indicates that cytoskeletal integrity or closely associated processes are essential for a normal coupling between Ca2+ stores and SOCE. The role of cytoskeletal reorganization in PS exposure and microparticle formation has been emphasized by several groups who studied the relationships between both events in platelets. Inhibition of actin polymerization by CytD affected the shedding of membrane vesicles but had no effect on the redistribution of PS between the two leaflets of the platelet plasma membrane (49Gaffet P. Bettache N. Bienvenüe A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 336-345PubMed Google Scholar). Other authors (50Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys.

However, in the present study, we have observed that the diminution of Ca2+ influx across plasma membrane induced by CytD results in a significant reduction of PS exposure with almost no effect on microparticle shedding. Here, the partial inhibition suggests that the cytoskeleton plays a modulatory role rather than a mandatory one in this particular Ca2+signaling pathway regulating PS exposure at the HEL cell surface. Recently, it has been observed that the actin-cytoskeleton is also able to modulate the uptake of membrane-derived microparticles by cells (54Mack M. Kleinschmidt A. Bruhl H. Klier C. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Plachy J. Stangassinger M. Erfle V. Schlondorff D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). These findings, when added to the results of the present study, suggest that cytoskeletal elements actively participate in the intercellular traffic of membrane proteins and, more generally, in the transcellular exchange of biological information. HEL cells express platelet-specific membrane glycoproteins (26Catani L. Gugliotta L. Motta M. Tazzari P. Baravelli S. Tura S. Haematologica. 1998; 83: 385-391PubMed Google Scholar) and possess a strong ability of PS externalization following stimulation. Hence, such cells represent a useful model to investigate platelet properties. Among the latter, PS-dependent procoagulant response has an essential physiologic significance as demonstrated by the bleeding tendency in subjects with Scott syndrome, a genetic defect of PS transmembrane migration (55Weiss H.J.

We have previously demonstrated that sequences within the C-terminal 19-amino acid domain flanking the isoprenylation motif of the large hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg-L) are important for virion assembly. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that in the absence of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), the wild-type HDAg-L was localized in the nuclei of transfected COS7 cells. Nevertheless, in the presence of HBsAg, the HDAg-L became both nuclei- and cytoplasm-distributed in about half of the cells. An HDAg-L mutant with a substitution of Pro-205 to alanine could neither form HDV-like particles nor shift the subcellular localization in the presence of HBsAg. In addition, nuclear trafficking of HDAg-L in heterokaryons indicated that HDAg-L is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein.

The HDAgs share identical functional domains within the common region, but exhibit very distinct functions in viral multiplication. The HDAg-S is required for the replication of HDV RNA, whereas the HDAg-L is essential for virion assembly and functions as a potent trans-dominant inhibitor in viral replication (5Kuo M.Y.-P.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the HDAg-L is capable of copackaging with the small HBsAg to form virus-like particles in both transfected Huh-7 and COS7 cells (7Chang F.-L. Chen P.-J.

HDAg-L is a nuclear phosphoprotein (12Chang M.-F. Baker S.C. Soe L.H. Kamahora T. Keck J.G. Makino S. Govindarajan S. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2403-2410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas HBsAg confines to the cytoplasm. Extensive deletion analysis of the HDAg-L revealed several functional motifs, including nuclear localization signals and oligomerization domains that are dispensable for the formation of virus-like particles (10Chang M.-F. Chen C.-J. Chang S.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 646-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Chen D.-S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5332-5336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the unique domain spanning amino acid residues 198–214 of the HDAg-L was demonstrated to contain signals sufficient for HDV assembly (10Chang M.-F. Chen C.-J. Chang S.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 646-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Chen D.-S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5332-5336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results implied that the HDV assembly occurs in the cytoplasm. Analysis within the isoprenylation motif of the HDAg-L (211-CRPQ-214) revealed a good correlation between package activity and the status of isoprenylation (14Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), but attachment of an isoprenylation motif did not render the HDAg-S a structure capable of copackaging with HBsAg (10Chang M.-F. Chen C.-J. Chang S.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 646-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results further suggested that the 13-amino acid stretch proceeding the isoprenylation motif of the HDAg-L plays a critical role on HDV assembly. In this study, we have further elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which the 13-amino acid stretch contributes to the assembly of HDV. Site-directed mutagenesis within the 13-amino acid stretch indicated that Pro-205 is critical for the relocalization of HDAg-L from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and is involved in the assembly of HDV. An interspecies heterokaryon assay clearly demonstrated that the HDAg-L is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. In addition, the C-terminal domain spanning amino acid residues 198–210 of the HDAg-L could function as a nuclear export signal, which directs nuclear export of the HDAg-L to the HBsAg-localized cytoplasm via a CRM1-independent pathway. Plasmids pECE-d-BE and pECE-d-SM contain cDNAs encoding the HDAg-L and HDAg-S, respectively (12Chang M.-F. Baker S.C. Soe L.H. Kamahora T. Keck J.G. Makino S. Govindarajan S. Lai M.M.C. J.

Plasmid pECE-C-ES encodes the small forms of the HBsAg, p24 and gp27 (10Chang M.-F. Chen C.-J. Chang S.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 646-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pCsrev-GFP (a gift from G. N. Pavlakis, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center) encodes a fusion protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Rev and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (16Stauber R. Gaitanaris G.A. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1995; 213: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 2G. N. Pavlakis, personal communication. These plasmids were used in transfection experiments. Plasmid pB1–3(NdeI) was derived from pT7-d-BP (12Chang M.-F. Baker S.C. Soe L.H. Kamahora T. Keck J.G. Makino S. Govindarajan S. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2403-2410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by removing the cDNA domain representing the 5′ untranslated region of the HDAg-L. This plasmid was generated for further construction of HDAg-L mutant plasmids. HDAg-L mutant plasmids encode large HDAgs with point mutations in the region spanning amino acid residues 198–210. The strategy that we used, with modifications, for constructing the mutant plasmids has been described previously (17Derbyshire K.M. Salvo J.J. Grindley N.D.F. Gene. 1986; 46: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,18Hill D.E. Oliphant A.R. Struhl K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 558-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, a degenerate 65-mer oligonucleotide C244 was chemically synthesized (5′-TCACTGGGGTCGACAAcTCtGGGgAGaGaAGGgAGgGTcGGcTGgGaAGaGTaTATCCCATGGGA-3′; lowercase letters represent degenerate nucleotides consisting of 91% of the indicated wild-type nucleotide sequences of the corresponding cDNA of the HDAg and 3% each of the other three nucleotides; underlining indicates the extra sequences, includingSalI and NcoI recognition sites for cloning purpose). The C244 oligonucleotide was converted into a double-stranded DNA by base pairing two molecules around the NcoI site and mutually primed synthesis with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The annealing reaction was performed in a buffer containing 140 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 15 mm MgCl2, 25 mm dithiothreitol at 65 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature over a period of 2 h. The extension reaction was carried out in the presence of 10 mm each of the dNTP for at least 3 h at 37 °C. Following digestions withSalI and NcoI restriction endonucleases, the resultant 49-base pair SalI-NcoI fragments were purified from a 2% agarose gel and used to replace the cognate fragment of plasmid pB1–3(NdeI). Mutations were identified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids with desired mutations were isolated and treated with SmaI and SalI restriction endonucleases. The resultant SmaI-Sal I fragments were used to replace the cognate fragment of pECE-d-SM. These generated plasmids that encode HDAg-L mutant proteins with amino acid substitutions spanning amino acid residues 198–210. An overview of the amino acid substitutions in the HDAg-L mutant proteins is given in Fig.1 A. Monkey kidney cells (COS7), human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (NIH3T3) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum plus 100 units of penicillin and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. DNA transfection (19Chang M.-F. Chang S.C. Chang C.-I. Wu K. Kang H.-Y. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6019-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and indirect immunofluorescence staining (20Lee C.-H. Chang S.C. Chen C.-J. Chang M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7650-7656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was performed as described previously, except that cells were seeded at 15–20% confluency 16 h prior to transfection. To determine the package activity of HDAg-L mutants, virus-like particles were collected from culture media as described previously (10Chang M.-F. Chen C.-J. Chang S.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 646-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the media were harvested 4 days posttransfection. In addition, the viral pellets were resuspended in 2× sample buffer (12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis to examine the presence of HBsAg and HDAg mutants. To perform immunoblot analysis, protein lysates separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were electrotransferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) at 800 V for 2 h at 4 °C. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature in a shaker bath and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with specific antibodies as follows. For determination of the package activity of HDAg-L mutants, three-fourths of viral pellet collected from the culture media was analyzed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to HDAg (21Lin J.-H. Chang M.-F. Baker S.C. Govindarajan S. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 1:2000 dilution in PBS containing 1% nonfat dried milk, and one-fourth of the viral pellet was analyzed with goat polyclonal antibodies specific to HBsAg (Dako) at 1:2000 dilution in the same buffer. The membrane was then washed at room temperature three times for 10 min each with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20, followed by an incubation with peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Pierce) and staining with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as described previously (22Chang M.-F. Sun C.-Y. Chen C.-J. Chang S.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2529-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that instead of the SIB (140 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2), Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.4) was used as the buffer system. In nuclear export assay, the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of microinjected oocytes of Xenopus laevis were analyzed for the presence of rabbit IgG-conjugated HDAg peptides with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson) at a 1:5000 dilution in PBS containing 1% nonfat dried milk and 0.05% Tween 20. Mouse IgG that was used as an internal control was detected by horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson) at a 1:10,000 dilution in the same buffer. The specific interactions between antigens and antibodies were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.). The heterokaryon assay was performed as described previously (23Sachdev S. Hennink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5445-5456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Whittaker G. Bui M. Helenius A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2743-2756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, HeLa cells were seeded onto coverslips at 20% confluency and transfected with HDAg-l-encoding plasmid pECE-d-BE on the next day. At 9 h posttransfection, NIH3T3 cells were added to yield 40% confluency, and cell fusion was carried out at 30 h posttransfection to promote interspecies heterokaryon formation. Cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) (Sigma) was added 1 h prior to cell fusion, and cell fusion was performed for 2 min with 50% polyethylene glycol 6000 (Merck) in PBS containing 0.1% glucose. Following an extensive wash and an additional incubation for 5 h in the culture medium containing cycloheximide, the cells were fixed and immunofluorescence staining was performed as described earlier. Cell nuclei were detected by Hoechst 33258 (1 μg/ml) (Sigma). The dye gives differential staining patterns of the nuclei of mouse NIH3T3 cells and human HeLa cells. Cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axiophot 2 fluorescence microscope. Peptides NES(HDAg-L) and NES*(HDAg-L) that represent HDAg-L from amino acid residues 198–210 (ILFPADPPFSPQS) and the peptide with Pro-205 replaced by Ala (ILFPADPAFSPQS, underlining indicates the mutation), respectively, were synthesized by peptide synthesizer (model 431, Applied Biosystems Inc.). Both peptides possess an additional cysteine residue at the NH2 termini for conjugation to affinity-purified rabbit IgG (IgG(r)) (Sigma). Activation of IgG(r) with the bifunctional cross-linking reagent sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate and conjugation to the synthetic peptides were carried out as described previously (25Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, 8 mg of sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate were added to 8 mg of IgG(r) in 1 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated for 1 h at 20 °C. The activated IgG(r) was subsequently separated from excess sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate by passing through a Sephadex P-6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4, and conjugated to equal amount of the synthetic peptides NES(HDAg-L) and NES*(HDAg-L). The reaction was carried out in PBS, pH 6.5, at room temperature for 3 h. Free peptides were removed by passing the mixture through a Sephadex P-6 column. The coupling ratio of both conjugates, IgG(r)-NES(HDAg-L) and IgG(r)-NES*(HDAg-L), were estimated to be 10 peptides per IgG(r) molecule as analyzed by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). For microinjection, the conjugates were concentrated to 20 mg/ml using a Centricon 30 (Amicon). For the study of nuclear export of HDAg peptides, stage VI oocytes from ovaries of X. laevis females were manually defolliculated, maintained at 20 °C in OR2 medium (825 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.0 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm Na2HPO4, 5.0 mmHEPES, pH 7.8), and used for microinjection within 3 days. For direct injection of protein samples into nuclei, the oocytes were carefully spun at 3,000 rpm for 10 min in an HS-4 rotor (Sorvall) prior to injection. Microinjection needles were prepared on a Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (model P-97, Sutter Instrument Co.) using borosilicate glass capillaries (0.75–1.0 mm, Sutter Instrument Co.). Rabbit IgG conjugated peptides IgG(r)-NES(HDAg-L) and IgG(r)-NES*(HDAg-L) were injected at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml, and an affinity-purified mouse IgG was coinjected as an internal control. The protein samples were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C immediately before injection. Following injections, the oocytes were incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h and then dissected manually in OR2 medium to separate the nuclei from cytoplasmic fraction. The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were homogenized by sonication four times for 15 s each and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble pellets. The resulting nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were subjected to SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis as described earlier. For analysis of the effect of leptomycin B on the subcellular distribution of Rev-GFP fusion protein, leptomycin B (provided by Norvatis) was added to the culture media at a final concentration of 2 nm at 24 h posttransfection, and actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) was added 2 h prior to cell fixation. For evaluation of the effect of leptomycin B on HDV assembly, leptomycin B was added at 24 h posttransfection at a final concentration of 2 or 20 nm for various time periods prior to immunoblot analysis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the unique C-terminal domain of the HDAg-L, encompassing a Pro-rich region and an isoprenylation motif 211-CRPQ-214, possesses signals sufficient for the assembly of HDV (10Chang M.-F. Chen C.-J. Chang S.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 646-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Chen D.-S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5332-5336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To determine specific amino acid residues that contribute to HDV assembly, site-directed mutagenesis in the domain composed of amino acid residues 198–210 of the HDAg-L was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following transformation, 120 recombinant DNA clones were picked for DNA sequencing, from which 41 substitution mutants of the HDAg-L were identified (data not shown). Eight mutant constructs harboring single amino acid substitution were selected (Fig.1 A) for virion package assay. As shown in Fig. 1 B, all of the eight constructs expressed mutant proteins in COS7 cells at levels similar to that of the wild-type HDAg-L (top panel). When virus-like particles in the culture media were harvested and analyzed for the presence of HBsAg and HDAg-L, both forms of the small HBsAg, p24 and gp27, were detected at comparable levels among the wild-type control and mutants (Fig.1 B, bottom panel). Nevertheless, the HDAg-L with single substitution of Pro-205 to Ala, designated HDAg(P205A), was not detected in the culture medium (Fig. 1 B, middle panel). These results indicated that Pro-205 is critical for the package activity of HDAg-L and the assembly of HDV. It is noteworthy that the amino acid substitution at the adjacent Pro-204 residue had little effect on the package activity. The variation of the package activity of the various HDAg-L mutants should reflect the intrinsic properties of individual amino acid residues. As expected, the HDAg-S that lacks the unique C-terminal sequence of HDAg-L failed to form virus-like particles with the small HBsAg (Fig. 1 B,lane HDAg-S). A previous study demonstrated that isoprenylation of HDAg-L mediates the interaction between HDAg-L and HBsAg in vitroand proposed that the interaction is the molecular basis of HDV assembly (26Hwang S.B. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7659-7662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Lai M.M.C. Chen D.-S. Virology. 1994; 199: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis does not explain where and how these two proteins come to direct contact in vivobecause HBsAg is localized in the cytoplasm and HDAg-L is a nuclear phosphoprotein (12Chang M.-F. Baker S.C. Soe L.H. Kamahora T. Keck J.G. Makino S. Govindarajan S. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2403-2410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand how the interaction occurs, COS7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HDAg-L and HBsAg, and immunofluorescence staining was performed at 12 h intervals 2 days posttransfection. At 48 h posttransfection, HDAg-L was detected exclusively in the nucleolus of transfected cells as the Type I pattern shown in Fig. 2 A. At 60 h posttransfection, about 25–35% of the transfected cells retained the Type I nucleolus staining pattern, but 65–75% of the cells exhibited both nucleolus and nucleoplasm staining pattern (Type II pattern) (Fig.2 A). The relocalization of HDAg-L from the Type I to the Type II pattern at 60 h posttransfection was also observed in the absence of HBsAg (Fig. 2 B). A striking change was observed at 72 h posttransfection; the HDAg-L became both nuclei- and cytoplasm-distributed (Fig. 2 A, Type III) in about 43–47% of the transfected cells in the presence of small HBsAg but was restricted to the nucleolus and nucleoplasm in up to 92–95% of the cells in the absence of HBsAg (Fig. 2 B). In addition, when COS7 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding HDAg-S and small HBsAg, the HDAg-S confined to the nuclei similar to that of cells transfected with HDAg-l-encoding plasmid alone (data not shown). The unique property of HDAg-L to relocalize to the cytoplasm in the presence of small HBsAg implied that the intracellular interaction between HDAg-L and HBsAg occurs in the cytoplasm and is mediated by the unique C terminus of the HDAg-L. We therefore made an assumption that the relocalization of HDAg-L to the cytoplasm is an essential step for HDV assembly. To examine this hypothesis, immunofluorescence staining was performed at 72 h posttransfection with the package-defective HDAg(P205A) and the package-competent HDAg(P204A) mutant proteins in the presence of small HBsAg. Interestingly, we observed a similar subcellular distribution pattern for the wild-type HDAg-L and HDAg(P204A) mutant protein, but the package-defective HDAg(P205A) mutant protein failed to relocalize from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The statistical results are summarized in Fig. 3. The correlation between relocalization and package activity of the HDAg-L suggested that the cytoplasmic relocalization of HDAg-L is facilitated by the unique C terminus of the HDAg-L and is essential for the viral assembly; the mutation at Pro-205 abolished cytoplasmic relocalization and rendered HDAg-L package-defective. The cytoplasmic relocalization of HDAg-L and its assembly with the cytoplasm-localized HBsAg suggested that HDAg-L bears an NES located in the unique C-terminal domain to facilitate the translocation. To examine this possibility, an interspecies heterokaryon assay was performed in the absence of HBsAg. HeLa cells were transfected with HDAg-l-encoding plasmid, fused with NIH3T3 cells in the presence of cycloheximide, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclei in the heterokaryons were readily distinguished by DNA stain Hoechst 33258; the NIH3T3 nuclei have a speckled staining pattern, whereas the HeLa cell nuclei were evenly stained (Fig.4, B and D). When the interspecies heterokaryons were analyzed with antibodies to HDAg-L, the HDAg-L was detected in both nuclei of the transfected HeLa cells and the untransfected NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4, A andC). Because the new protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide, the nuclear trafficking of HDAg-L in heterokaryons indicated that HDAg-L possesses an NES and is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. To further examine whether the NES of HDAg-L is located in the unique C-terminal domain, an HDAg peptide, NES(HDAg-L), representing amino acid residues 198–210 of HDAg-L, was synthesized and chemically conjugated to rabbit IgG (Fig.5 A). The resultant IgG(r)-NES(HDAg-L) was coinjected with a control mouse IgG (IgG(m)) into the nuclei of Xenopus oocytes. At 1.5 h postinjection, the oocytes were dissected manually into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and immunoblot analysis was performed to detect the subcellular localization of the IgG(r)-NES(HDAg-L) and IgG(m). Results demonstrated that a majority of the IgG(r)-NES(HDAg-L) transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, whereas the control IgG(m) retained to be nucleus-localized (Fig. 5 B, left panel). These results indicated that the HDAg-L peptide spanning amino acid residues 198–210 acted as an NES to escort IgG(r) to the cytoplasm. To correlate the nuclear export function of HDAg-L to the assembly of HDV, an HDAg-L mutant peptide with Pro-205 replaced by Ala was synthesized and conjugated to IgG(r) (Fig. 5 A). The resultant IgG(r)-NES*(HDAg-L) was coinjected with IgG(m) into the nuclei of Xenopus oocytes. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated a retention of IgG(r)-NES*(HDAg-L) in the nucleus (Fig. 5 B, right panel). Because HDAg(P205A) was shown to be package-defective (Fig. 1 B), these results indicated that Pro-205 is critical for both the nuclear export of HDAg-L and the assembly of HDV. HDAg-L has previously been demonstrated to be important for the assembly of HDAg-S and HDV RNA (28Chang M.-F. Chen C.-H. Lin S.-L. Chen C.-J. Chang S.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2508-2514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wang H.-W. Chen P.-J. Lee C.-Z. Wu H.-L. Chen D.-S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6363-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our current data strongly suggest that the NES(HDAg-L) spanning amino acid residues 198–210 of the HDAg-L plays an essential role in the assembly of HDV by triggering the nuclear export of HDAg-L. Unlike the prototype leucine-rich NES of the Rev protein of HIV-1 (Fig. 6), the amino acid sequences of the NES(HDAg-L),198ILFPADPPFSPQS210, is rich in proline residues. Previous studies have identified CRM1 as a receptor for the leucine-rich NES (30Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W.

To investigate whether CRM1 is involved in the nuclear export of HDAg-L and the assembly of HDV, a system in which leptomycin B blocked the nuclear export of the HIV Rev protein was first established. The nucleolus-localized Rev protein exported to the cytoplasm of transfected COS7 cells when RNA synthesis was inhibited by actinomycin D. Such a translocation was abolished when leptomycin B was added to the culture media at 24 h posttransfection (Fig.7 A). This system was used to study the effect of leptomycin B on HDV assembly. COS7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HDAg-L and small HBsAg, and leptomycin B was added at 24 h posttransfection. At 48 and 72 h after the addition of leptomycin B, culture media were harvested and analyzed for the package activity of HDAg-L. Interestingly, we found that leptomycin B had no significant effect on the package activity of HDAg-L (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that the nuclear export of HDAg-L is mediated by a CRM1-independent pathway distinct from that of Rev-like leucine-rich NES.Figure 7Leptomycin B has little effect on HDV assembly. A, leptomycin B inhibits the nuclear export of HIV Rev protein in the presence of actinomycin D. COS7 cells were transfected with plasmid pCsrev-GFP encoding a Rev-GFP fusion protein and incubated for 48 h in the culture medium alone (left) or in the presence of 1 μg of actinomycin D (AD)/ml during the last 2 h of incubation without (middle) or with (right) the addition of 2 nm leptomycin B (LMB) at 24 h posttransfection. The cells were fixed 48 h posttransfection. Fluorescence micrographs are shown. B,leptomycin B has little effect on HDV assembly. COS7 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding HDAg-L and small HBsAg. Leptomycin B was added 24 h posttransfection at various concentrations, as indicated, and incubated for various time periods. Immunoblot analysis was performed with the cell lysates (top panel) and the viral pellets collected from the culture media (middle andbottom panels) with antibodies specific to HDAg-L and HBsAg as indicated. Quantitation was performed with densitometer (ImageMaster VDS, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and efficiencies of HDV assembly are indicated as relative package activity (%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we have demonstrated the nuclear trafficking of HDAg-L in heterokaryons and determined that amino acid residues 198–210 within the unique C-terminal domain of the HDAg-L can function as a nuclear export signal. In addition, Pro-205 is critical for the package activity and nuclear export of HDAg-L, but a mutation at the adjacent residue Pro-204 has little effect on the package and subcellular distribution. The cytoplasm targeting of HDAg-L is a prerequisite for the assembly of HDV. Nuclear export signals have been identified in both viral and cellular proteins (Fig. 6) (35Fischer U. Huber J.

The Rev protein of HIV-1 binds to Rev response element and escorts unspliced and partially spliced viral RNAs to the cytoplasm; the export is mediated by a leucine-rich NES (35Fischer U. Huber J.

Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10608-10613Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, leptomycin B specifically abrogated the export of the Rev protein and viral RNA by binding to the cysteine residue in the middle domain of CRM1, a receptor for the leucine-rich NES (Fig.7 A) (33Wolff B. Sanglier J.-J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 34Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S.

In the present study, we have identified an NES of HDAg-L spanning amino acid residues 198–210 (Fig. 5). The NES(HDAg-L) represents an atypical NES that is rich in proline (Fig. 6). In addition, the feature of insensitive to leptomycin B (Fig. 7) suggest that the NES(HDAg-L) drives nuclear export of the HDAg-L via a CRM1-independent pathway different from that of the Rev-like NES. Interestingly, a recent study also identified a CRM1-independent nuclear export of heterogeneous RNP K (40Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). However, the NES of heterogeneous RNP K is rich in serine and acidic residues (Fig. 6). These indicate that different mechanisms mediated by a variety of nuclear export signals are involved in the nuclear export pathway. The molecular mechanism of HDV assembly is not fully understood, and cellular receptors participate in the nuclear export remain to be elucidated. However, the present study has provided some information. Our current working hypothesis is that HDV genomic RNA forms RNP complexes with the HDAgs that translocate from nucleoplasm to the nuclear membrane via an interaction between NES(HDAg-L) and an unidentified NES receptor. The RNP complexes then move further to the endoplasmic reticulum for assembly with HBsAg. The isoprenylation motif that is known to be important for the package activity of HDAg-L (10Chang M.-F.

To complete the life cycle of HDV, progeny viral particles transport to the plasma membrane and exocytosis occurs to release mature viral particles into the extracellular milieu.

https://openalex.org/W2072497467,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a particular hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) mutant associated with Taiwanese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Initially, the entire coding region of HBx gene from the serum samples of 14 Taiwanese patients were sequenced. A novel mutant, HBx-A31, was preferentially found in patients with HCC. Sera from 67 patients with HCC and 100 patients with chronic hepatitis B were thus subjected for codon 31 analysis using a dual amplification created restriction site method. HBx-A31 was detected more frequently in patients with HCC (52% versus 12%; P<0.001) and in patients with liver cirrhosis (44% versus 6%; P<0.001). Site directed mutagenesis experiment revealed that HBx-A31 was less effective in transactivating HBV enhancer I-X promoter complex, less efficient in supporting HBV replication, and less potent in enhancing TNF-alpha induced increment of CPP32/caspase 3 activities in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, a prevalent HBx mutant was identified in Taiwanese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Development of this mutant might represent a strategy of the virus to escape immune surveillance and thus contribute to the process of multiple-step hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964393500,"Chicken avidin, a homotetramer that binds four molecules of biotin was converted to a monomeric form by successive mutations of interface residues to alanine. The major contribution to monomer formation was the mutation of two aspartic acid residues, which together account for ten hydrogen bonding interactions at the 1–4 interface. Mutation of these residues, together with the three hydrophobic residues at the 1–3 interface, led to stable monomer formation in the absence of biotin. Upon addition of biotin, the monomeric avidin reassociated to the tetramer, which exhibited properties similar to those of native avidin, with respect to biotin binding, thermostability, and protease resistance. To our knowledge, these unexpected results represent the first example of a small monovalent ligand that induces oligomerization of a monomeric protein.

This study may suggest a biological role for low molecular weight ligands in inducing oligomerization and in maintaining the stability of multimeric protein assemblies. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fast protein liquid chromatography Many proteins are composed of more than one subunit. The principles and rationale for the spatial arrangement of subunits (or monomers) into dimers, trimers, and tetramers are still not well understood. The role of multimeric associations in binding and protein activity is still a mystery, particularly for proteins in which it was shown that each subunit contains the necessary information for binding or activity. Consequently, interaction between subunits is apparently unnecessary for binding of a ligand. An example of this phenomenon is the aldolase homotetramer, in which each subunit exhibits identical catalytic activity (1Beernink P.T. Tolan D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5374-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Avidin is a homotetramer (molecular weight ∼63,000), each monomer of which binds a single biotin molecule with the highest known affinity in nature between a protein and a ligand (2Green N.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 85-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar, 3Green N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of avidin has been solved, and the interactions among the various residues at the intersubunit interfaces have been determined (4Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 5Pugliese L. Coda A. Malcovati M. Bolognesi M. J. Mol.

The avidin tetramer is essentially a dimer of dimers consisting of three types of monomer-monomer interactions (Fig.1), as discussed in detail by Livnah et al. (4Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The 1–4 intermonomer interface exhibits an excessive monomer-monomer interface (1780 Å2 per monomer) and forms a structurally cohesive dimer. The two monomers are so tightly integrated that this particular dimer can essentially be regarded structurally as a single entity. In contrast, the 1–2 and 1–3 interfaces each comprise only a selected number of critical interactions (buried surface areas of 557 Å2 and 147 Å2 per monomer, respectively). Thus, the dimer-dimer interaction is dictated by the combined 1–2 and 1–3 interfaces. The 1–3 interface consists of a contribution of only three amino acids from each monomer (4Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), namely Met-96, Val-115, and Ile-117 (Fig. 1 B). This clearly hydrophobic interaction has a contact surface of 147 Å2, which is a mere 20% of the dimer-dimer interaction. The 1–4 interface is characterized by extensive polar and hydrophobic interactions. Some of the polar interactions consist of an intricate network of hydrogen-bonding interactions, sometimes involving conserved water molecules. The ten hydrogen-bonding interactions observed for the side chains of two of these residues, Asn-54 and Asn-69 (each from the opposite monomer), are particularly extensive (Fig. 1,C and D). Because of the 2-fold symmetry axis, perpendicular to the plane of the 1–4 interface, the site is duplicated on opposite poles of the overall interacting interface (Fig.1 C). The two residues are positioned within the same site but on opposite monomers (Fig. 1 D). The extensive structural information currently available on avidin renders the avidin-biotin complex an excellent model to study protein-protein interactions and how oligomerization may affect the structural and functional properties of the protein. It would be challenging to determine the minimal number of changes necessary to form functional protein dimers or monomers. In this context, we have recently described dimeric, biotin-binding forms of both chicken avidin and bacterial streptavidin. In both proteins, an unconventional single-residue mutation was performed, by which a binding-site tryptophan, which also forms a critical part of the 1–2 interface, was converted to a lysine (7Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The biotin binding was reversible, and the dimeric structure was retained in both proteins before and after binding to biotin. In the present study, we describe the construction of a set of avidin mutants in which selected 1–3 and 1–4 interface residues were modified to alanine. Successive mutation of these residues caused a progressive weakening of the quaternary structure. In the absence of biotin, two of the mutants proved to be stable soluble monomers. Surprisingly, the presence of biotin regenerated stable avidin tetramers in these two mutants. This is the first instance in which a small ligand that binds to a single subunit causes subunit assembly into a stable tetramer. The results suggest that even though a monomer can bind a ligand, stability factors can favor formation of the native oligomer. This study may be important for designing novel binding proteins and for demonstrating the role(s) of the quaternary structure in maintaining stability of multisubunit proteins. Chicken egg white Avidin cDNA was mutated by the megaprimer method (8Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) using pGEMAV (9Airenne K.J. Sarkkinen P. Punnonen E.-L. Kulomaa M.S. Gene. 1994; 144: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as a template. When combined mutants were created, the former constructs were used as a template. After the a second PCR amplification, the products were digested withBglII and HindIII, extracted from agarose, and cloned into the BamHI/HindIII-treated pFASTBAC1 plasmid to construct recombinant vectors. The vectors were transformed into JM109 cells, and the nucleotide sequences were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using an automated DNA sequencing instrument. The preparations of recombinant viruses were completed according to the manufacturer's instructions of the Bac-To-Bac™ baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The primary virus stocks were amplified for large scale production of mutants, and the titers of virus stocks were determined by a plaque assay procedure (10O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckov V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 130-132Google Scholar). Mutant avidins were produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells described previously (7Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Purification on 2-iminobiotin-agarose column was performed from cell extracts grown in biotin-free medium as described by Airenne et al. (11Airenne K.J. Oker-Blom C. Marjomäki V.S. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The determination of binding constants for avidin and its mutants to iminobiotin were performed using an IASyS optical biosensor as reported earlier (12Marttila A.T. Airenne K.J. Laitinen O.H. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Reversibility of biotin binding was determined by competitive binding to biotinylated biosensor surfaces and by competitive biotin-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as detailed earlier (7Laitinen O.H.

The molecular mass of a mutant was calculated from the known amino acid composition using the GCG package program Peptidesort (Genetic Computer Group, Madison, WI). SDS-PAGE,1 immunoblot analyses, and assays for protease sensitivity were performed according to Laitinen et al. (7Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For stability analysis, protein samples were combined with sample buffer and incubated at selected temperatures for 20 min before being subjected to SDS-PAGE (13Bayer E.A. Ehrlich-Rogozinski S. Wilchek M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Quaternary states of untreated or biotin-treated avidin and mutant samples were defined by FPLC as described recently (7Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In a recent study (7Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we mutated a critical tryptophan residue to a lysine in both avidin and streptavidin. This tryptophan (Trp-110 in avidin and Trp-120 in streptavidin) plays a dual role in both proteins. On one hand, it serves a biological role as one of the major biotin-binding residues. On the other hand, it plays a major structural role in characterizing one of the three intermonomer interactions (the 1–2 interface). The consequence of the tryptophan-lysine exchange was 2-fold; (a) the affinity constant of the biotin binding was reduced, and the binding could be reversed, and (b) the mutated protein formed a stable dimer in solution. Because dimer formation requires the combined counteraction of two interfaces, the inference was such that a drastic mutation also affected the weaker 1–3 interface leaving the extensive 1–4 interface intact. In the present work, we investigated the residues in avidin, which contribute to these latter two interfaces, with the intention of disrupting the tetramer into smaller components. The three hydrophobic amino acids that line the 1–3 interface and selected polar residues that play a major role in the 1–4 interface were changed to alanine, thereby reducing the hydrophobic nature of the first set and eliminating hydrogen-bonding potential of the second. The target residues were selected on the basis of the 3D structure of avidin (4Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), taking into account their suspected contribution to the respective intermonomer interface.

Isolation of the mutants on iminobiotin-agarose resulted in pure products of high yields (data not shown), comparable with those reported earlier (11Airenne K.J. Oker-Blom C. Marjomäki V.S.

In general, the 2-iminobiotin purification scheme used was very efficient in terms of protein purity, because no contaminating proteins could be observed in Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. To study the reversibility of biotin binding, an assay based on optical biosensor technology was designed. The results showed that only native avidin and Avm-4a were completely irreversible (Fig. 2). The three mutants exhibited levels of reversibility between 30 and 45%. In this group of mutants, reversible biotin binding was highest for Avm-[3,4a]. To measure the actual binding constants of native avidin and the mutants for 2-iminobiotin, we used an IASyS optical biosensor. The measurements indicated that interaction of mutants Avm-3 and Avm-4a with 2-iminobiotin surfaces was similar to that of native avidin (TableII.). Calculation of theK d values from ka andkd and direct determination ofK d from the binding curves gave comparable values. Because of the monomer-tetramer transition following biotin binding, we could not use the IASyS biosensor to evaluate the actual binding constants for mutants Avm-[3,4a] and Avm-[3,4b]; in qualitative terms, however, these mutants also showed strong binding to 2-iminobiotin (not shown).Table IIOptical biosensor data for the affinity of iminobiotin to native avidin and selected interface mutantsNamek a(m−1 s−1)k d(s−1)K d(m) 2-aDissociation constants calculated from k a and k d values, derived from association analysis using a plot ofk on against protein concentration.K d(m) 2-bDissociation constant determined directly from the binding curves.Avidin1.56 × 1042.66 × 10−41.7 × 10−82.0 × 10−8Avm-31.43 × 104NDND7.4 × 10−8Avm-4a3.76 × 1041.19 × 10−33.1 × 10−82.7 × 10−8Values for Avm-[3,4a] and Avm-[3,4b] were inapplicable due to the monomer-tetramer transition in these mutants.

The stability of the mutants was analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (7Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When compared with native avidin, all the mutants showed decreased stability (Figs. 3 and4). Avm-3 and Avm-4a exhibited partial tetrameric structure in SDS-PAGE at ambient temperatures in the absence of biotin. In contrast, Avm-[3,4a] and Avm-[3,4b] migrated as monomers, even at room temperature in the absence of biotin. In the presence of biotin all mutants formed tetramers that displayed stability characteristics similar to those of native avidin.Figure 4Quantitative thermostability analysis of avidin and the mutants. Biotin-free or biotin-complexed mutant or native avidin samples were treated as described in the legend for Fig.2. Densitometry tracings from each gel were graphed as a function of temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In protease assays, all mutants showed lowered resistance to proteinase K degradation compared with native avidin (Fig.5). In the absence of biotin, all mutants were rapidly degraded. Upon addition of biotin, however, complete resistance (similar to native avidin) was restored to all mutants except Avm-[3,4a], which exhibited only 75% resistance to degradation. The quaternary status of the mutants was analyzed by gel filtration FPLC. The theoretical molecular mass for all mutant monomers without the oligosaccharide side chain is between 14,127 and 14,300 daltons. According to the FPLC data, the observed mass for Avm-[3,4a], in the absence of biotin, was 13,990 daltons. After saturation with biotin, the mass was calculated to be 58,900 daltons. The corresponding masses for Avm-[3,4b] were 14,280 and 55,960 daltons. These values suggest that in the absence of biotin, Avm-[3,4a] and Avm-[3,4b] were monomers but that they formed tetramers upon biotin binding. In contrast, Avm-3 and Avm-4a formed tetramers even in the absence of biotin (Fig. 6). The aim of this study was to elucidate the minimal number of changes in the interface residues among the subunits of the avidin tetramer, which would lead to disruption of the avidin tetramer into monomers without destroying the strong binding specificity for biotin. Such a monomeric avidin would be a valuable tool for studying the contribution of different residues (and their bonding interactions) to the extreme stability of the tetrameric structure and biotin-binding capacity of the avidin molecule. In the broader sense, such a study may also shed light on protein-protein interactions in general. The avidin tetramer was thus probed by converting selected interface residues to alanine via site-directed mutagenesis. For this purpose, all three hydrophobic residues in the 1–3 interface were mutagenized (Fig. 1 B). In addition, two critical 1–4 interface residues, Asn-54 and Asn-69, were also modified. We considered that alteration of the latter two residues to alanine would preclude the formation of the extensive hydrogen-bonding network involving these residues, thus abolishing the conserved water molecule and perturbing the entire 1–4 interface (see Fig. 1 D). The combination of these mutations may thus result in a substantial weakening of the tetrameric assembly of avidin. Indeed, in the absence of biotin, both Avm-[3,4] mutants were found to exist in the monomeric state in solution. When biotin was introduced, however, a stable avidin tetramer was assembled, presumably because of the additional interaction in the 1–2 interface between Trp-110 (from the adjacent monomer) and biotin in its binding pocket. This result demonstrates the critical importance of the 1–2 interaction for the stability of the avidin molecule. It is known that biotin enhances the stability of native avidin, and in the present study we have shown that biotin not only stabilizes the native protein but that it can also play a role in the assembly of tetrameric avidin from the monomer. This study also sheds light on the importance of the major 1–2 interface and Trp-110 for tetramer formation. Indeed, we have shown recently that (in both avidin and streptavidin) the unconventional mutation of this tryptophan to a lysine residue resulted in a stable dimeric protein in solution, both in the presence and absence of biotin (7Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this context, previous studies with streptavidin have demonstrated that even conservative mutation of this tryptophan (Trp-120) to phenylalanine or alanine reduced the biotin binding and weakened intersubunit association (14Chilkoti A. Tan P.H. Stayton P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. V. S. A. 1995; 92: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The results of the present study strengthen our previous claims that to preserve high affinity biotin binding, the binding-site residues should be retained, particularly the aromatic ones. In contrast, a certain amount of latitude is permissible in modifying the other residues, including the loop and β-strand residues (12Marttila A.T. Airenne K.J. Laitinen O.H. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Marttila A.T. Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The present study also demonstrates that it is possible to manipulate the interfacial residues quite freely to alanine, thereby reducing both hydrophobic interactions (e.g. in the 1–3 interface) and hydrogen bonding (in the 1–4 interface). The efficient isolation of all mutants on 2-iminobiotin-agarose may indicate that the monomeric mutants formed tetramers upon interaction with the immobilized ligand. Under acidic conditions the mutated proteins were converted to the monomers, which could be reassociated to the tetramer upon interaction with free or immobilized ligands. This indicates that constant interaction with the ligand is a prerequisite for tetramerization of the interface mutants. These results also imply that biotin is not a necessary element for proper folding of the monomeric avidin. Together with our previous results concerning the dimeric avidin and streptavidin mutants, this also indicates that the avidin β-barrel per se is a stable tertiary structure and capable of folding correctly without the involvement of neighboring monomers. According to Ellison et al. (16Ellison D. Hinton J. Hubbard S.J. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 7: 1337-1345Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the mechanism that protects the native avidin-biotin complex against proteinase K treatment appears to be the closure and consequent rigidity of the loop between β-strands 3 and 4. Compared with native avidin, however, all the mutants used in this study were rapidly digested in the absence of biotin by this enzyme but were all stable in the presence of biotin. This result was not surprising for mutants Avm-[3,4a] and Avm-[3,4b], which were monomers in the absence of biotin. These data are also in good agreement with our recent findings regarding the dimeric avidin mutant (W110K) that remains dimeric in both the absence and presence of biotin (7Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This dimeric mutant was rapidly degraded both in the presence and absence of biotin. It thus seems possible that the tetrameric form of avidin is important for rendering the molecule stable to proteolytic digestion. On the other hand, tetramerization alone may not suffice, as evident from the observed protease sensitivity of the tetrameric Avm-3 and Avm-4a in the absence of biotin. Consequently, biotin binding may be the major factor in protecting the tetramer against proteolytic digestion. Weakening of the quaternary structure of the tetramer seems to correlate well with susceptibility to protease digestion, as well as reduced resistance against denaturation in SDS-PAGE. Upon regeneration of the Avm-[3,4a] and Avm-[3,4b] tetramers by adding biotin, the extreme stability characteristics (similar to those exhibited by the native protein) were restored. The results of this study may have broader implications regarding why avidin and streptavidin appear as tetramers in the native state and how proteins form oligomers in general. We can thus conclude that unusually high ligand-binding affinity and the exceptional stability of avidin and streptavidin are two sides of the same coin. We do not yet know which of these properties is more important, but it seems that the two have coevolved, and it is difficult to separate them. Many intracellular processes are mediated through inducible protein-protein interactions (17Klemm J.D. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 569-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These can also be achieved by using bivalent ligands (18Ho S.N. Biggar S.R. Spencer D.M. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 382: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In most cases, monomeric ligands can cause dissociation of such protein-protein interactions (19Rollins C.T. Rivera V.M. Woolfson D.N. Keenan T. Hatada M. Adams S.E. Andrade L.J. Yaeger D. van Schravendijk M.R. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Clackson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7096-7099Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The biotin-induced monomer-tetramer transition is the first example of a monomeric ligand that causes association of protein components. This phenomenon may eventually be amenable to biotechnological application. The capacity to produce a monovalent form of avidin, which can then undergo oligomerization upon addition of biotin, iminobiotin, or other avidin-binding ligands, may open new avenues for the production of different intracellular fusion proteins that can be switched on by oligomerization. The possibility of subsequent coupling of such a fusion protein with a natural counterpart or substrate may enable new perspectives in controlling protein-protein interactions and the importance of oligomerization to cellular processes. The mutated avidins may also be applicable for reversible assembly and dismantling of working proteins in living cells.

Streptolysin is well known for its use in cell biology for the permeabilization of cells. As well as pore formation leading to the breakdown of membrane barriers into cells and between tissues, these toxins act in a complex manner involving the activation of intracellular signaling pathways and the induction of inflammation, among other responses (see Morgan et al.

These direct structural insights have been augmented by results obtained by Tweten and co-workers (4Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K.

A second terminal domain is known to be involved in membrane binding via cholesterol. Thus, it seems that the CBT mechanism involves two domains interacting with the membrane (6Nakamura M.

First, pneumolysin is well known as a pore-forming toxin that binds to cholesterol in membranes, oligomerizes into ring-shaped assemblies, and undergoes conformational changes causing it to penetrate and form a pore within the bilayer (3Gilbert R.J.C.

Secondly, pneumolysin activates the complement system in a nonimmunospecific manner as a result of interaction with IgG-Fc and complement proteins (8Mitchell T.J. Andrew P.W. Saunders F.K. Smith A.N.

Changes in protein-induced phospholipid phase behavior can be observed through characteristic intensity distribution in the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA)-dominated lineshapes of wideline 31P NMR spectra. Characteristic lineshapes have been observed from phospholipid phases with different modes of molecular motions (Fig. 1 and Refs. 13Seelig J. Seelig A. Q. Rev.

Here results from solid-state NMR and electron microscopy are presented that provide novel insights into the mechanism of CBTs and complement data already acquired using other techniques. Suspensions of cholesterol-containing liposomes are a model system that has already been used for analysis of pore formation by pneumolysin using small-angle neutron scattering (9Gilbert R.J.C.

Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of egg-yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesterol, and dicetylphosphate (DCP) in a 10:10:1 molar ratio were prepared in 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, at 5 mm concentration as previously described (3Gilbert R.J.C.

Multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) used in a control experiment were prepared by five cycles of rapid freezing of hydrated lipid mixtures followed by 15 min equilibration at 40 °C. Pneumolysin was expressed from recombinant Escherichia coliand purified as previously described (17Gilbert R.J.C. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Tweten R.K. Morgan P.J. Mitchell T.J. Errington N. Rowe A.J.

Pneumolysin was mixed with liposomes at a variety of molar ratios to cholesterol and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to data acquisition. Phosphorus-31 wideline and MAS NMR measurements were carried out on a CMX Infinity 500 spectrometer at a proton frequency of 500 MHz. Typically 5 μmol of lipid dispersion were used in a 4-mm rotor using an HX Apex probe. A single 90° pulse was used for detection with broadband decoupling at the proton frequency during acquisition. The 90° pulse length was 4 μs, and the strength of the proton decoupling field was 20 kHz. The dwell time used was 40 μs, and 2048 points were collected in each experiment. Between 300 and 3000 transients were averaged for each free induction decay (FID) during MAS experiments and between 5000 and 10,000 during wideline experiments with a 5-s delay (exceeding 5T 1) between acquisitions in all cases. The sample rotation speed was maintained at 12 kHz during acquisition of the MAS spectra, and the temperature was set to 30 °C for all experiments. High speed MAS lineshape analysis was performed by fitting simulated Lorentzian lines to the experimental spectra using Spinsight (Chemagnetics, Fort Collins, CO) and Felix (MSI, Cambridge). The intensity of the individual lines was estimated from the integral of the simulated spectra. All 31P chemical shifts are measured relative to 0 ppm for 10% v/v phosphoric acid. All spectra were obtained with 50 Hz linebroadening for the wideline spectra and 10 Hz for the MAS spectra. Samples of LUV suspensions from NMR experiments were prepared for freeze-fracture by equilibration at room temperature, followed by a rapid immersion into liquid butane at its solidification point (18Severs N.J. Newman T.M. Shotton D.M. Severs N.J. Shotton D.M. Rapid Freezing, Freeze-fracture and Deep Etching. Wiley-Liss, NY1995: 31-50Google Scholar). Fracture of the immobilized frozen droplets was performed at −100 °C, followed by platinum shadowing at 45° with respect to the fractured surface and a normal deposition of a uniform carbon film in a Balzers freeze-etching apparatus. Residual sample was removed from the carbon-platinum replicas by cyclic exposure to potassium hypochlorate and methanol. The carbon-platinum replicas were transferred onto copper electron microscope grids. A Phillips CM120 transmission electron microscope was used for grid visualization at 100-kV accelerating voltage and 45,000 × magnification. Wideline 31P NMR was used to monitor changes in the phospholipid phase behavior induced by the addition of pneumolysin. LUVs of egg yolk PC, cholesterol, and DCP (molar ratio 10:10:1) were incubated with pneumolysin at 30 °C. Spectra from the lipid vesicles alone (see Fig. 2 a) and in the presence of pneumolysin at different concentrations are shown (Fig.2, b–d). The 31P NMR spectrum from lipid suspension prior to addition of pneumolysin (Fig. 2 a) consists of a single narrow line. The collapse of the phosphorus CSA is because of fast rotation of relatively small (<100 nm in diameter) unilamellar vesicles (19Burnell E.E. Cullis P.R. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 603: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The correlation times (τR) for tumbling of such vesicles are on the order of 10−4–10−5s, which exceeds the inverse width of the average 31P CSA (∼40–50 ppm, ∼6 kHz) for lipid phosphates in extended bilayers. Fig. 2 b shows the spectrum from the phospholipid dispersion after addition of pneumolysin at 0.5 mol % with respect to cholesterol. The spectrum is characteristic of a 31P CSA-dominated spherically averaged (powder) pattern (20Pake G.E. Purcell E.M. Physiol. Rev. 1948; 74: 1184Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar) from phospholipid bilayers in extended structures of average size greatly exceeding 100 nm. The most likely cause of this change in apparent liposome size when compared with protein-free liposomes (Fig.2 a) is vesicle aggregation induced by the interaction of toxin with the membranes. The motional properties of these complexes indicate that the average size of the lipid aggregates exceeds 1 μm because their reorientation rate (τR−1) is much lower than 6 kHz (the effective CSA of lipid phosphates). The spectrum of Fig. 2 b reveals three overlapping features, a powder pattern between ∼27 and −14 ppm (below dotted line), a second powder pattern with reduced effective CSA from 5 to −2 ppm (above dashed line), and an inverted powder-like distribution from 3 to about −8 ppm (Fig. 2, between dottedand dashed lines, see characteristic lineshapes). The two powder patterns arise from a spherical distribution of lipid molecules rapidly rotating about their long axes. The downfield intense feature in the powder patterns corresponds to molecules oriented at 90 degrees with respect to the external magnetic field and the upfield distribution of intensity to molecules oriented along the field. The width of the broader powder pattern (below dotted line) is characteristic of phosphatidylcholine aggregates undergoing slow reorientation and is likely to result from liposomes aggregated in the presence of pneumolysin. The narrow powder pattern (above dashed line) is generated by the phosphates of DCP in the same lipid bilayer. These powder distributions can be observed as a result of the interaction between the vesicles in the presence of pneumolysin. The relative intensity of the powder patterns with respect to each other is independent of the amount of toxin added to the lipid suspension (Fig.2, b–d), which suggests that the PC/DCP ratio in the bilayer remains constant. In a control experiment, an MLV (large complexes with τR−1 ≫ effective CSA) suspension produced a wideline 31P NMR spectrum (Fig.3) consisting of two powder patterns of comparable relative intensity and of similar effective CSA to the powder patterns observed in the presence of pneumolysin (Fig. 2). The inverted powder-like feature of Fig. 2 b is characterized by a sharp upfield edge, arising from molecules oriented at 90 degrees with respect to the external field and a downfield extended region from lipids oriented along the magnetic field. Inverted powder-like patterns arise from nonbilayer lipid complexes with cylindrical symmetry of motion like, for example, the lipid tubular structures in inverted hexagonal (HII) phases (14Cullis P.R. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 559: 399-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). The effective CSA, measured from these patterns (∼11 ppm), is less than the expected half-spectral width from the bilayer environment (∼40 ppm) and exceeds the measured effective CSA of the narrow powder pattern (associated with the presence of DCP). This suggests that fast rotation of the phospholipid aggregates in the axially symmetric environment results in additional reduction in the effective CSA and excludes the possibility of formation of a cylindrically symmetric lipid distribution from the lipid environment with small effective CSA by a simple reduction of spherical to cylindrical symmetry. In the latter case, the width of the axially symmetric distribution would be derived as a half of the effective CSA in the related spherical distribution (14Cullis P.R. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 559: 399-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar, 15Yeagle P.L. Biol. Magn. Reson. 1990; 9: 1-50Crossref Google Scholar). Further increase in the pneumolysin concentration results in a relative increase in the intensity of the cylindrical lipid distribution and a decrease in the intensity of both powder patterns (Fig. 2, cand d). This behavior shows that the cylindrical lipid population arises from a pneumolysin-associated lipid environment. The good spectral definition of the characteristic edges of the lipid environments indicates well separated phases with none or with very slow (τex−1 < 200 Hz), lipid exchange between them. The 90° edges from the different lipid environments remain at the same chemical shift, which suggests that the effective CSA and, therefore, the motional characteristics of these environments are independent of pneumolysin concentration. Phosphorus-31 MAS NMR is used here as a high-resolution approach to membrane studies for quantitative characterization of the different phospholipid environments (11Pinheiro T.J.T. Watts A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). High speed MAS 31P NMR spectra from different lipid-pneumolysin mixtures are shown in Fig. 4. The lipid suspension in the absence of toxin gives rise to a single resonance at ∼0 ppm. The observed unusual chemical shift of the resonance line and the lack of resolution between PC and DCP are most likely because of an interference of the vesicle tumbling and lateral diffusion of the phospholipid molecules with the proton-phosphorus decoupling and MAS. Such interaction may result in inefficient proton decoupling and incomplete averaging of the 31P CSA under MAS for 100 nm LUVs (see Ref. 21Traikia M. Langlais D.B. Cannarozzi G.M. Devaux P.F. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 125: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar for discussion). In a control 31P MAS NMR experiment an MLV suspension of the same composition produced a strong resonance at approximately −1.0 ppm, attributed to the PC phosphate and a weak resonance at 0.1 ppm from DCP (spectrum not shown). All 31P MAS NMR spectra in the presence of pneumolysin show two distinctive resonances, (Fig. 4, b–d), a downfield one at approximately −1.0 ppm and an upfield resonance with chemical shift dependent on the pneumolysin concentration (TableI). The resonance at −1.0 ppm has the characteristic chemical shift of phosphatidylcholine in a bilayer environment (11Pinheiro T.J.T. Watts A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and consists of two overlapping resonances, one of FWHH approximately equal to 1.61 ppm and another of 0.35 ppm FWHH. The FWHH of the broader resonance increases at higher pneumolysin concentration, whereas that of the narrower resonance does not show a clear dependence on toxin concentration. The broader resonance, therefore, probably arises from pneumolysin-associated lipid within the lipid bilayer phase in the form of pores (see EM evidence below) or between partially fused liposomes. A low intensity resonance at 0.1 ppm arises from DCP in the bilayer. The ratio between its intensity and the intensity of the PC at −1.0 ppm resonance does not depend on pneumolysin concentration.Table IPhosphorous-31 isotropic chemical shiftsPneumolysinςpaBilayer lipid is in LUVs and not in the extended bilayers.ςfI pI fmol %ppmppm%%0.000.000.0001000.500.65−1.0432681.251.01−1.0540601.501.12−1.056040Phosphorous-31 isotropic chemical shifts (ςp, ςf) from MAS NMR of the non-bilayer and total bilayer lipid resonance and relative intensity I as a fraction of the total spectral intensity determined from the spectra in Fig. 2 for different concentrations of pneumolysin with respect to cholesterol at 30 °C are shown.1-a Bilayer lipid is in LUVs and not in the extended bilayers. Open table in a new tab Phosphorous-31 isotropic chemical shifts (ςp, ςf) from MAS NMR of the non-bilayer and total bilayer lipid resonance and relative intensity I as a fraction of the total spectral intensity determined from the spectra in Fig. 2 for different concentrations of pneumolysin with respect to cholesterol at 30 °C are shown. The narrow upfield resonance (Fig. 4 b) undergoes a pronounced further upfield change in its isotropic chemical shift, ς, with increasing pneumolysin concentration (Table I). The relative intensity of this resonance when compared with the total intensity of the line at −1.0 ppm increases as the toxin concentration is increased (Table I). The toxin concentration-dependent increase in the intensity of this resonance parallels, in a qualitative way, the increase in the intensity of the reverse powder pattern, observed in the static spectra (Fig. 2, b–d). Therefore, the upfield resonance most likely arises from lipid associated with pneumolysin in the nonbilayer environment. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy was used to obtain information about the lipid phase topology in the presence of pneumolysin. Fig. 5 shows transmission electron micrographs from the lipid system in the presence of 1.25 mol % pneumolysin with respect to cholesterol. The micrographs show aggregated lipid vesicles, with the vesicles varying in size from one hundred to a few hundred nanometers. Fractures across the vesicles reveal single or only a few bilayers and thus the absence of multibilayer structures. Nonaggregated vesicles are also seen in coexistence with the vesicle aggregates. Multifaceted liposome surfaces reveal close foam-like aggregation. The surfaces of some liposomes show the presence of circular structures of ∼25 nm internal diameter (Fig. 5 a, arrow p). Previously observed pneumolysin oligomers have a similar size to these circular structures and represent, most likely, membrane-incorporated oligomeric toxin pores (3Gilbert R.J.C. Jiménez J.L. Chen S. Tickle I. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Andrew P.W. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Free ring-shaped structures unassociated with liposomes are also observed with an inside diameter of ∼25 nm and an outside diameter of about 50 nm (Fig. 5 a, arrow r). These appear to be the only axially symmetric structures in the system and are the same size as the rings seen here on liposomes, and previously on liposomes in solution (3Gilbert R.J.C. Jiménez J.L. Chen S. Tickle I. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Andrew P.W. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 b (arrow) shows a structure of the same size (∼25-nm inner diameter) as the rings of Fig. 5 a, localized at the boundary between two liposomes having a common wall. This suggests that pneumolysin oligomers play a role in liposome aggregation and fusion. A lipid environment resembling that in the proteolipid rings is associated with the pneumolysin ring shown in Fig. 5 b. This suggests that vesicle aggregation may be related to the formation of nonbilayer proteolipid structures. An important aspect of the effect of pneumolysin on membranes is the destabilizing effect the protein has on the lipid bilayers and the associated withdrawal of phospholipids into nonbilayer structures. The wideline 31P NMR spectra (Fig. 2, b–d) originate from a coexistence of phospholipids in structures with a spherically averaged CSA corresponding to the CSA of slowly tumbling MLV's, together with a nonbilayer phase with axially symmetric motion of the lipid structures. The changes in intensity distribution from a powder, to a distribution with the 90° edge located upfield with respect to the 0° extreme, are indicative of the presence of an additional axis of phospholipid molecular averaging, perpendicular to the main axis of lipid rotation. This situation is observed, for example, in the presence of inverted hexagonal (HII) phases (15Yeagle P.L. Biol. Magn. Reson. 1990; 9: 1-50Crossref Google Scholar, 22Bloom M. Thewalt J.L. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition to the inversion of spectral intensity distribution, the overall width of the CSA-dominated intensity distribution is expected to decrease by a factor of 2 (see Fig. 1 and Refs. 13Seelig J. Seelig A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1980; 13: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 15Yeagle P.L. Biol. Magn. Reson. 1990; 9: 1-50Crossref Google Scholar). The width of the spectrum from the pneumolysin-induced nonbilayer phase (∼10 ppm) is reduced further to ∼one-fourth of the spectral width from the lipid powder distribution (∼40 ppm). This suggests the presence of fast axial rotation of the lipids in these structures and that they are smaller than the average diameter of a lipid aggregate in an HII phase. The increase in the fraction of the nonbilayer phase with increasing toxin concentration strongly indicates that its formation is induced by pneumolysin (Fig.2, b–d). The ring structures, shown in the micrographs in Fig. 5 possess all the characteristics necessary to give rise to the inverted powder component in the static 31P NMR spectra of Fig. 2, b–d. Their ring shape results in a preferred axis of motional averaging and their relatively small size would facilitate fast axial rotation. The internal diameter of these structures corresponds to the size of pneumolysin rings observed by negative staining EM and cryo-EM (3Gilbert R.J.C. Jiménez J.L. Chen S. Tickle I. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Andrew P.W. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17Gilbert R.J.C. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Tweten R.K. Morgan P.J. Mitchell T.J. Errington N. Rowe A.J. Andrew P.W. Byron O. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for the rings seen here by EM and detected by a characteristic spectral distribution similar to that of a nonbilayer phase (Fig. 2) is an oligomeric pneumolysin ring with a lipid annulus decorating the exterior of the oligomer (Fig.6). The interior of such structures could be filled with lipid or empty, because both forms of oligomers have been observed by cryo-EM (3Gilbert R.J.C. Jiménez J.L. Chen S. Tickle I. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Andrew P.W. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). 2R. J. C. Gilbert, J. L. Jimenez, S. Chen, and H. R. Saibil, unpublished results. In either case the evolution of such structures into free solution from liposomes, with which pneumolysin interacts would result in the rapid destruction of the membrane. The relative intensity of the nonbilayer spectral feature increases in comparison to the intensities of both the wide and the narrow powder patterns. The concomitant increase in the intensity of the upfield resonance in the 31P MAS NMR spectra can be used as a measure of the relative amount of nonbilayer phase (proteolipid rings). Thus the quantitation of spectral intensity (Table I) reflects the fraction of the total lipid, segregated into the rings and indicates that a large proportion of the lipid is associated with free oligomers detached from the lipid bilayer. In particular, the values presented in Table I show that an increase in pneumolysin concentration with respect to cholesterol from 0.5 to 1.5 mol % results in an increase of nonbilayer phase from 32 to 60% of the total phospholipid content. Consequently, in the presence of ∼1 mol % of pneumolysin, 28 phospholipid molecules are associated with each pneumolysin monomer and the number of phospholipid molecules per oligomer, consisting of 30 to 50 toxin molecules (3Gilbert R.J.C. Jiménez J.L. Chen S. Tickle I. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Andrew P.W. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), can be estimated to vary between 840 and 1400, respectively. The insights gained here into the mechanism of CBTs are fundamentally important because they suggest that toxin pores do not remain associated with bilayer membranes or bilayer fragments derived from cells, which have been lysed. On the contrary, they become dispersed in complexes with phospholipids and possibly also cholesterol. However, fluorescence studies on the CBT perfringolysin have been interpreted on the premise that the lipids with which the toxin is complexed following pore formation exist in a bilayer environment as part of permeabilized membranes (4Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 5Shatursky O. Heuck A.P. Shepard L.A. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Cell. 1999; 99: 293-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that this is not a valid assumption to make and that therefore conclusions on the regions of CBTs that interact with membranes cannot simply be based on fluorescence data, because lipids complexed with CBT oligomers apparently exist in a variety of environments where solid state NMR can be used to distinguish and quantitate in an approximate way. It is possible to obtain a lower limit for the life-time of the existence of proteolipid rings from the 31P MAS NMR spectra. Two well resolved lines, arising from the two distinct lipid populations, are observed at a CS separation of ∼2 ppm (Fig. 4, TableI). The FWHH of the resonance from the nonbilayer environment is ∼0.3 ppm. This suggests that any putative exchange of lipid molecules between the bilayer and the nonbilayer lipid environments may occur at a rate much slower than 60 Hz (∼1.7 ppm at 500 MHz) or the nonbilayer phase is stable over times exceeding 15 ms. The freeze-fracture electron micrographs of pneumolysin-containing lipid systems (Fig. 5 a) are produced by rapid (∼104 degrees/second) freezing and reveal the presence of small lipid vesicles derived from the initial suspension, interacting in a toxin-independent fashion with the remaining lipid. These small vesicles appear in the immediate vicinity of the other lipid structures, trapped between larger lipid aggregates, indicating that such toxin-free structures coexist along with other vesicles or liposome-containing toxin. Bearing in mind that the location of these liposomes is within the pneumolysin-induced aggregate, it is reasonable to deduce that they result from the effect of pneumolysin on membranes. The data suggest that the mechanism of pore formation firstly involves oligomerization on or in a bilayer but that later the oligomeric rings enter free solution, withdrawing a large fraction of the lipid membrane into the rings (Fig. 6). A number of conductance experiments carried out on CBTs indicate that they create pores of a range of sizes and lifetimes in membranes, the smallest of which may be blocked using divalent cations (24Korchev Y.E. Bashford C.L. Pederzolli C. Pasternak C.A. Morgan P.J. Andrew P.W. Mitchell T.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that pores do indeed form within membranes. What our results indicate is that the precise nature of such pores is still uncertain, and may involve lesions formed at the interfaces of nascent oligomeric structures and lipids (25Palmer M. Harris R. Freytag C. Kehoe M. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1598-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and discrete protein complexes within membranes (3Gilbert R.J.C. Jiménez J.L. Chen S. Tickle I. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Andrew P.W. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) but also large holes in the bilayer alone. Furthermore, effects downstream of oligomerization and pore-formation involving large scale redistribution of membrane components are indicated by our data. It is suggested that the lytic action of pneumolysin on lipid bilayers is a complex combination of pore formation within the membrane, extraction of lipid into free oligomeric complexes, aggregation and fusion of membranes, and membrane destabilization leading to formation of small vesicles. These observations suggest that CBTs may not only permeabilize cell membranes but also cause them to bleb, to aggregate, and to fuse. The appearance of a large proportion of the lipid and protein as free oligomer-lipid complexes is also important for understanding the noncytolytic mechanisms associated with pneumolysin. As mentioned above, pneumolysin has the ability directly to activate the complement system in a nonimmunospecific manner. This occurs by the classical pathway as a result of the interaction of pneumolysin, IgG-Fc, and complement components (8Mitchell T.J. Andrew P.W. Saunders F.K. Smith A.N. Boulnois G.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1883-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Toxin oligomers are known to be capable of complement activation (8Mitchell T.J. Andrew P.W. Saunders F.K. Smith A.N. Boulnois G.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1883-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and the existence of large numbers of free oligomers in solution might explain this facility. Although streptolysin has been reported to activate complement in the presence of anti-streptolysin antibodies (26Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 713-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nonimmunospecific activation of complement has not been demonstrated so far for other CBTs. The oligomers of streptolysin were also found to have a hyperactivating effect on complement compared with monomeric toxin. Such a phenomenon may also occur with pneumolysin, because the domain through which pneumolysin activates complement (the C-terminal domain) has a fold very similar to IgG-Fc, with which it interacts during complement activation (8Mitchell T.J. Andrew P.W. Saunders F.K. Smith A.N. Boulnois G.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1883-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 2Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W.

Jaton J.-T. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which suggests the possibility that the lipids associated with free oligomers may themselves elicit an immune response because nonbilayer (nonplanar) lipid structures have been shown to be highly immunogenic (28Aguillar L.

One mechanism by which glycation damages proteins is through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and various studies link the production of glycation products and the formation of ROS (18Giardino I.

Recent studies suggest that lens pigments, in the presence (26Linetsky M. James H.L. Ortwerth B.J. Exp.

The Amadori product, the initial reaction product in the Maillard reaction, remains almost constant within normal aging lenses, but it occurs at much higher levels in diabetic and senile cataractous lenses (28Garlick R.L.

Photobiol. 1995; 62: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) found that ascorbate-derived AGEs can produce ROS, and human lenses contain relatively large amounts of ascorbate. Oxidation of ascorbate produces highly reactive compounds, including dicarbonyls that can form AGEs (34Nagaraj R.H. Monnier V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 35Shipanova I.N. Glomb M.A. Nagaraj R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We reasoned that, if glycation products are a source of ROS in the lens, continued formation of ROS could account for cumulative damage to lens crystallins during aging and cataractogenesis. However, we made the surprising discovery that glycated proteins can produce pentosidine, a protein cross-linking AGE on native unmodified lens proteins. Accordingly, we investigated the formation of pentosidine from early and advanced glycation products on α-crystallin, and we propose a pathway for pentosidine synthesis from short-chain carbohydrates derived from degradation of early glycation products. Bovine lenses were obtained from Pel-Freez Biologicals, Roger, AR. EAH-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ. Lysozyme, cytochrome c, Chelex-100, deferoxamine, α-ketoglutarate, luminol, thiourea,N-α-acetyllysine, and N-α-acetylarginine were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. EDC and salicylate were purchased from Aldrich. Furosine standard was from Neosystem, France. Normal and diabetic human lenses were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange and the Cleveland Eye Bank. Human brunescent lenses were obtained from India (J. N. Medical College Hospital, Aligarh, India). All buffers (unless otherwise mentioned) were prepared with Chelex-100-treated water and, after preparation, were passed through a Chelex-100 column to remove any remaining metal ions. After decapsulation, bovine lenses were homogenized with a hand-held glass homogenizer in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mKCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% sodium azide. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant containing the bovine lens proteins (BLP) was dialyzed against water for 24 h. α-Crystallin (mixture of αA and αB) was isolated from BLP by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 (36Li L. Exp. Eye Res. 1978; 27: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The pooled α-crystallin fraction from the column was dialyzed against 4 liters of phosphate-buffered saline for 48 h and lyophilized. α-Crystallin or lysozyme was immobilized on EAH-Sepharose gel (illustrated in Scheme I). Five milliliters of EAH-Sepharose was washed three times with water and adjusted to pH 4.5 with dilute HCl. The gel was then collected in a conical tube and suspended in 10.0 ml of water with 100 mg of α-crystallin and 191 mg of EDC. The contents were gently mixed at 4 °C for 12 h. The pH of the mixture was maintained by adding dilute NaOH. At the end of the reaction, the gel was filtered and thoroughly washed five times, alternating 0.1m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) with 0.5 mNaCl and 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) with 0.5m NaCl. The washed and immobilized protein preparation was stored at 4 °C until use. STGP gel (α-crystallin or lysozyme) was prepared by reacting EAH-Sepharose-immobilized proteins with 500 mmd-ribose for 2 days at 37 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and LTGP gel was prepared by reacting the proteins with 100 mmd-ribose for 15 days at 37 °C. After glycation, the gels were washed extensively with water to remove unreacted ribose and stored at 4 °C until use. Superoxide anion production by STGP and LTGP gels was measured by cytochrome c reduction, as described by Bhuyan and Bhuyan (37Bhuyan D. Bhuyan K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochromec reduction was taken to be a measure of superoxide anion. STGP and LTGP gels (100 mg each) were incubated in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at room temperature with slow stirring. Aliquots were withdrawn at fixed time intervals for cytochrome c reduction assay. Hydroxyl radical production by glycated gels (from α-crystallin) was measured by the salicylate hydroxylation method. Typically, 100 mg of STGP- or LTGP gel was incubated with salicylate. The amount of 2,3-dihydroxy benzoate formed was assayed by a spectrometric method (38Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 361-365Google Scholar) described by Bhuyan and Bhuyan (37Bhuyan D. Bhuyan K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). STGP and LTGP gels (100 mg each) (from α-crystallin) were acid hydrolyzed in 6n HCl for 16 h at 110 °C. The contents were dried in a Speed-Vac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Inc. Farmingdale, NY), rehydrated in 200 μl of water, and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. Pentosidine was measured by the HPLC method as described previously (9Nagaraj R.H. Sell D.R. Prabhakaram M. Ortwerth B.J. Monnier V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10257-10261Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and quantified by comparison with a standard curve for synthetic pentosidine. The STGP and LTGP gels (from α-crystallin or lyzozyme) were washed 10 times with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) before incubation. BLP or lyzozyme (2 mg/ml) was incubated with the STGP- or LTGP gels (100 mg) in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C with gentle mixing for up to 7 days. The final volume of the reaction mixture was 1.0 ml. BLP incubated with unglycated α-crystallin (EAH-Sepharose bound) served as control. Aliquots (0.2 ml) were drawn at regular time intervals. In some experiments with α-crystallin immobilized gels, we added ROS quenchers (1.0 mm luminol, 5 mm α-ketoglutarate, 5 mm mannitol), metal ion chelator (1 mmdeferoxamine), or FeCl3 (100 μm) at the start of the reaction. Pentosidine was measured by HPLC. N-α-Acetyllysine (5 mm) and N-α-acetylarginine (5 mm) were incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) as described above for BLP. Aliquots of the supernatant were taken after 3 and 7 days for pentosidine measurement. In some experiments, air-tight screw cap tubes with an inlet for argon were used to incubate 100-mg STGP- or LTGP gel with BLP under anaerobic conditions. Otherwise, incubation conditions were as indicated earlier. Argon was bubbled through the mixture for 20 min and the argon-air mixture was removed with a vacuum pump. The tubes were then tightly sealed and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. Controls included nonglycated protein gels and glycated gels incubated without proteins. In addition, samples were also incubated simultaneously under aerobic conditions for comparison. Water-insoluble proteins (WI) from nondiabetic aged (age: 67 years) or brunescent lenses (age: 76 years), were prepared as described by Shamsi et al. (39Shamsi F.A. Partal A. Sady C. Glomb M.A. Nagaraj R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6928-6936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). 5 mg of WI was washed thoroughly five times with 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). After the final wash, 2.0 mg of BLP was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 7 days. Aliquots (0.2 ml) were taken at 3 and 7 days to measure pentosidine. Furosine content in the WI before and after incubation was measured by HPLC (Alltech, Dearfield, IL) using a furosine-dedicated column (40Resmini P. Pellegrino L. Battelli G. Ital. J. Food Sci. 1990; 2: 173-184Google Scholar). For some incubations, the WI protein extract was reduced with sodium borohydride. Incubations of WI with sodium phosphate buffer alone served as a control. Water-soluble lens protein (WS) was isolated (34Nagaraj R.H. Monnier V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) from age- and wet-weight-matched normal and diabetic (nuclear cataractous lenses from patients with Type II diabetes, diabetes duration: >10 years) human lenses. Two lenses (200–240 mg) from donors of 60–70 years of age were used for each sample. The samples were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), and loaded onto a previously equilibrated (50 mm phosphate buffer) Affi-Gel-601 boronate column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA). The amount of protein bound to the column was calculated by subtracting the amount of unbound proteins from the amount loaded on the column. After binding of WS samples, the gel was thoroughly washed with buffer and then used in incubations with 2.0 mg of BLP in sodium phosphate buffer at 37 °C for up to 7 days. Some experiments used N-α-acetylarginine (5 mm) + N-α-acetyllysine (5 mm) in the place of BLP. In other experiments, the gel was reduced with sodium borohydride before incubation. Aliquots from the supernatant were assayed for pentosidine. N-α-Acetylarginine andN-α-acetyllysine were incubated with two and three carbon carbohydrates. N-α-Acetylarginine andN-α-acetyllysine (5 mm each) were incubated in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 5 mmcarbohydrate at 37 °C. Aliquots were drawn at 24 and 48 h, and pentosidine was measured after acid hydrolysis (6 n HCl, 110 °C, 16 h). SDS-PAGE used 15% gels under reducing conditions according to the method of Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Amino acid content of acid-hydrolyzed proteins was measured by the ninhydrin reaction (34Nagaraj R.H. Monnier V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and protein was measured by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Sodium borohydride (SBH) reductions involved incubating 5 mg of protein with 5 mm SBH for 2 h at room temperature at pH 9.0 with slow stirring. Unreacted SBH was removed by washing the protein (WI). Mean differences were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance using StatView Software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Fisher's protected least significant difference test was employed in these calculations. We considered a p value of <0.05 statistically significant. In all figures the means that do not share a common superscript are statistically different atp < 0.05. We found no pentosidine in control incubations where EAH-Sepharose immobilized proteins with or without glycation were incubated with buffer alone. These controls rule out the possibility of pentosidine leaching from the gel or the formation of pentosidine on the gel itself. Pentosidine was measured by HPLC and expressed as nanomoles per gram of gel. LTGP had nearly twice the amount of pentosidine (4.8 ± 0.3 nmol/g of gel) as compared with STGP (2.5 ± 0.1 nmol/g of gel). We were unable to quantify the Amadori product of the ribose reaction with protein amino groups, because there are no specific assays for it. Measurements of pentosidine indicate that LTGP accumulated more AGEs than did STGP. However, as suggested by the studies of Booth et al. (42Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), we expected STGP to accumulate more Amadori product under the incubation conditions of our experiments. We used superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c as a measure of superoxide anion. Fig.1 A shows that superoxide anion was minimal with unmodified α-crystallin (coupled to gel) but was significant in glycated α-crystallin (coupled to gel). SOD inhibited superoxide anion production from both STGP and LTGP gels. Based on the data, we calculated that the amount produced by STGP gel and LTGP gel was 9.5 ± 2.1 nmol/h/g of gel and 7.8 ± 2.0 nmol/h/g of gel, respectively. Hydroxyl radical production was twice that in STGP gel (6.2 ± 2.3 μmol/h/g of gel) compared with the LTGP gel (3.0 ± 0.9 μmol/h/g of gel) (Fig. 1 B). The STGP and LTGP gels prepared from incubation of EAH-Sepharose-α-crystallin with ribose were washed thoroughly before every incubation to remove loosely bound glycated proteins and any breakdown products formed during storage. The gels were then incubated with BLP. Pentosidine was measured after acid hydrolysis of an aliquot of the incubation mixture. HPLC chromatograms showed pentosidine as a well-resolved peak from samples in which BLP incubated with STGP and LTGP gels (Fig. 2 A). Fig.2 B shows that the pentosidine content in both incubations nearly doubled at 7 days compared with the amount at 3 days. The STGP gel produced two to three times as much pentosidine as did the LTGP gel (p < 0.05). These results indicate that pentosidine is produced from carbohydrates derived from glycated proteins, and the early glycation products (Amadori and Schiff's base) are the precursors. STGP and LTGP gels were incubated with BLP for 7 days in the presence or absence of a ROS quencher or deferoxamine or FeCl3. As can be seen in Fig.3, addition of α-ketoglutarate (a scavenger of H2O2) most effectively inhibited pentosidine formation in BLP incubated with SGTP gels; pentosidine was approximately half that in samples incubated without the ROS quencher. Luminol, an O⨪2 scavenger, only marginally inhibited pentosidine formation, and thiourea, an OH⋅ scavenger, inhibited it by ∼30%. The effects were not as great in incubations with LTGP gels, but α-ketoglutarate and thiourea caused significant (p < 0.05) inhibition. The metal ion chelator, deferoxamine, was ineffective. Addition of 100 μmFeCl3 enhanced pentosidine formation in both STGP and LTGP gels. The increase was 17% with STGP and 73% with LTGP gel. These results suggest that H2O2 is an important constituent in pentosidine synthesis from glycated proteins. To assess the importance of oxygen in the formation of pentosidine, we did some incubations in the absence of oxygen. Table I shows that pentosidine was decreased ∼64 and 98% in STGP and LTGP gels in the absence of oxygen, which indicates that oxidative reactions mediated by ROS are necessary for pentosidine formation.Table IEffect of ± oxygen in the formation of pentosidine from STGP and LTGP gelsExperimentPentosidineDecrease+O2−O2pmol/mg protein%ControlSTGP31.811.264LTGP20.60.3498BLP (2 mg/ml in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was incubated with 100 mg of STGP and LTGP gel at 37 °C in the presence and absence of oxygen for 3 days. Pentosidine in BLP was estimated by HPLC. Open table in a new tab BLP (2 mg/ml in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was incubated with 100 mg of STGP and LTGP gel at 37 °C in the presence and absence of oxygen for 3 days. Pentosidine in BLP was estimated by HPLC. SDS-PAGE revealed that BLP underwent covalent cross-linking upon incubation with glycated gels. We found cross-linked proteins of molecular mass 40–45 kDa in both STGP and LTGP gel incubated proteins (Fig. 4 A). STGP gels incubated with BLP produced higher levels of these proteins than comparable incubations with LTGP gels, suggesting that covalent cross-linking possibly occurred as a result of pentosidine and other AGEs in BLP. Results of densitometric analysis showed that, after 7 days of incubation, STGP gel produced nearly three times as much cross-linked proteins as did the LTGP gel (Fig. 4 B). The amount of pentosidine formed from lysozyme after 3 and 7 days of incubation with STGP gel was 9.7 ± 1.3 and 13.2 ± 0.9 pmol/μmol of amino acids, whereas in LTGP gel measured at the same time, it was 2.5 ± 0.8 and 5.3 ± 0.6 pmol/μmol of amino acids (Fig.5 A). Again, the amounts measured in STGP gel were higher than those in LTGP gel. The pentosidine levels in the STGP gel samples after 7 days incubation with lyzozyme were about half those measured in BLP incubated under similar conditions. In another set of experiments, gels were incubated withN-α-acetylarginine + N-α-acetyllysine instead of BLP. Arginine and lysine are precursor amino acids for pentosidine, and we found that significant amounts of pentosidine were produced in these incubations. The levels were 30–44% higher following incubation with STGP gel than with the LTGP gel (Fig. 5 B). Taken together, these results show that pentosidine formation is not specific to BLP alone and that it forms in other proteins as well. Lysozyme was immobilized on EAH-Sepharose and glycated usingd-ribose. STGP and LTGP gels were prepared by incubating with d-ribose for 2 and 15 days. As shown in Fig.6, incubations with the STGP gel consistently yielded more pentosidine than did the LTGP gel, but pentosidine formation in both increased from 3 to 7 days. STGP or LTGP gels were also incubated with a mixture ofN-α-acetylarginine + N-α-acetyllysine, and the results were similar to those obtained with BLP (Fig.6 B). Together these incubation experiments confirm that pentosidine formation on unmodified native proteins occurs not only with glycated α-crystallin but also with other proteins. To determine whether these lens proteins could mimic the effects of in vitro glycated proteins, we incubated WI proteins from aged or brunescent lenses with BLP. This experiment also helped us to establish that glucose-derived early glycation products produce pentosidine. We washed the WI thoroughly with water before incubation to remove all soluble protein and incubated them with BLP (2 mg/ml) for 3 and 7 days. Analysis of BLP after incubation revealed that proteins from aged lenses produced nearly 3-fold higher levels of pentosidine (Fig.7, A and B) than proteins from brunescent lenses. Sodium borohydride treatment of WI before incubation with BLP almost completely suppressed pentosidine formation (Fig. 7 B). Furosine content of WI protein of aged and brunescent lenses was estimated before and after incubation. The amount of furosine in WI of aged and brunescent lenses were similar (∼500 pmol/μmol of amino acids) (Fig. 7 C) but was completely degraded after 7 days of incubation (Fig. 7 D). As expected, sodium borohydride treatment resulted in the reduction of the Amadori, and therefore, furosine was not detected in these samples (Fig. 7 D). These results show that proteins glycatedin vivo can produce pentosidine on nonglycated proteins and that early glycation products are pentosidine precursors. We calculated that 18.5 and 28.8 mg of protein from early glycation products were bound to a boronate affinity gel from incubations with aged and diabetic lenses. The gel was then incubated with BLP or a mixture of N-α-acetylarginine +N-α-acetyllysine. As Fig. 8shows, the bound proteins produced pentosidine in BLP. The amounts formed from diabetic lens proteins were higher than those formed by aged lenses after either 3 or 7 days of incubation. Similarly, when a mixture of N-α-acetylarginine +N-α-acetyllysine was added to the matrix-bound diabetic lens proteins, pentosidine formation was nearly twice that from comparable samples from aged lenses. Neither control incubations of BLP with gel, but without bound lens proteins, nor incubations with amino acids or BLP produced pentosidine. We concluded that diabetic lenses produce more pentosidine than nondiabetic lenses of comparable age, and that early glycation products promote pentosidine formation. To determine which of the fragments derived from early glycation products might serve as precursors of pentosidine, we incubated two and three carbon carbohydrates with a mixture of N-α-acetylarginine + N-α-acetyllysine and measured the amount of pentosidine formed. Among the carbohydrates tested, glyceraldehyde produced the highest levels of pentosidine followed by glycolaldehyde and glyoxal (Table II). 1H NMR (D2O) and UV absorption spectra of the product from glyceraldehyde were fully compatible with those reported for ribose-derived pentosidine (43Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21597-21602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). In the case of glycolaldehyde and glyoxal, spectroscopic characterization is necessary to confirm the formation of pentosidine.Table IIFormation of pentosidine from short-chain carbohydratesShort-chain carbohydratesPentosidine1 day2 daysnmol/mlGlyoxal0.030.12Glycolaldehyde26.8628.08Glyceraldehyde34.5035.86Oxalic acidGlyoxalic acidMethyl"

Indeed, NO has been shown to increase the mRNA binding activity of the iron-regulatory protein 1, which is a major regulator of iron homeostasis. Recently, we have shown that NO generators increase59Fe efflux from cells prelabeled with59Fe-transferrin (Wardrop, S. L., Watts, R. N., and Richardson, D. R. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 2748–2758). The mechanism involved in this process remains unknown, and in this investigation we demonstrate that it is potentiated upon adding d-glucose (d-Glc) to the reincubation medium. In d-Glc-free ord-Glc-containing media, 5.6 and 16.5% of cellular59Fe was released, respectively, in the presence ofS-nitrosoglutathione. This difference in 59Fe release was observed with a variety of NO generators and cell types and was not due to a change in cell viability. Kinetic studies showed thatd-Glc had no effect on the rate of NO production by NO generators. Moreover, only the metabolizable monosaccharidesd-Glc and d-mannose could stimulate NO-mediated59Fe mobilization, whereas other sugars not easily metabolized by fibroblasts had no effect. Hence, metabolism of the monosaccharides was essential to increase NO-mediated 59Fe release. Incubation of cells with the citric acid cycle intermediates, citrate and pyruvate, did not enhance NO-mediated 59Fe release. Significantly, preincubation with the GSH-depleting agents,l-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine or diethyl maleate, prevented NO-mediated 59Fe mobilization. This effect was reversed by incubating cells withN-acetyl-l-cysteine that reconstitutes GSH. These results indicate that GSH levels are essential for NO-mediated59Fe efflux. Hence, d-Glc metabolism via the hexose monophosphate shunt resulting in the generation of GSH may be essential for NO-mediated 59Fe release. These results have important implications for intracellular signaling by NO and also NO-mediated cytotoxicity of activated macrophages that is due, in part, to iron release from tumor target cells.

These results have important implications for intracellular signaling by NO and also NO-mediated cytotoxicity of activated macrophages that is due, in part, to iron release from tumor target cells. nitrogen monoxide l-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine diethyl maleate d-glucose d-mannose d-fructose desferrioxamine S-nitrosoglutathione hexose monophosphate shunt iron-regulatory protein 1 N-acetyl-l-cysteine pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine spermine-NONOate transferrin 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone Virtually every field of physiology has been influenced by nitrogen monoxide (NO),1 a small, relatively unstable, potentially toxic, diatomic free radical gas, that is produced in a diverse variety of mammalian cells (for reviews see Refs. 1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 2Stamler J. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J.

NO has a physiological role as a short lived messenger molecule and has two principal functions in cells, servoregulation and cytotoxicity. Considering servoregulation, NO is produced in small amounts under physiological conditions and mediates vasorelaxation, regulates blood pressure, controls the adhesion and aggregation of platelets and neutrophils, and is involved in neurotransmission. Most of these actions are mediated through the binding of NO to iron in the heme prosthetic group of soluble guanylate cyclase (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 3Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Indeed, the high affinity of NO for iron and other metal ions is a well known branch of coordination chemistry (2Stamler J. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). The importance of iron in mediating the functions of NO is also apparent when examining its cytotoxic effects (3Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The cytotoxic functions of NO are observed when it is produced in much larger amounts by macrophages, hepatocytes, and other cells following their exposure to cytokines or microbial products. Interestingly, NO produced via such high output systems inhibits the proliferation of intracellular pathogens and tumor cells. These effects can be explained by the reactivity of NO with iron in the Fe-S centers of important macromolecules, including aconitase and complexes I and II of the electron transport chain (4Drapier J.-C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 5Drapier J.-C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2829-2838PubMed Google Scholar, 6Henry Y. Ducrocq C. Drapier J.-C. Pellat C. Guissani A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The high affinity of NO for iron probably results in both the removal of iron from [Fe-S] centers and the formation of dinitrosyl iron species within [Fe-S] proteins (for review see Ref. 7Drapier J.-C. BioEssay. 1997; 11: 319-329Google Scholar). NO has been shown to form complexes with a variety of important iron-containing proteins such as ferritin (8Lee M. Arosio P. Cozzi A. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3679-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), ribonucleotide reductase (9Lepoivre M. Fieschi F. Coves J. Thelander L. Fontecave M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), heme-containing proteins (10Ignarro L.J. Blood Vessels. 1991; 28: 67-73PubMed Google Scholar, 11Khatsenko O.G. Gross S.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5710-5713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In fact, ferritin has been suggested to act as a store of NO (8Lee M. Arosio P. Cozzi A. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3679-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and NO-mediated iron release from ferritin has been shown in vitro (14Reif D.W. Simmons R.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Interestingly, co-cultivation of tumor cells with activated macrophages results in the inhibition of target cell DNA synthesis and a concomitant loss of a large fraction (64% per 24 h) of intracellular iron (15Hibbs Jr., J.B. Taintor R.R. Vavrin Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It was speculated that the loss of iron may be due to the NO-mediated release of iron from enzymes such as mitochondrial aconitase (4Drapier J.-C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 16Hibbs Jr., J.B. Taintor R.R. Vavrin Z. Rachlin E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). In contrast to the work of Hibbs and others (4Drapier J.-C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 17Lancaster J.R. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1990; 166: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that NO targets loosely bound pools of non-heme iron, rather than mitochondrial Fe-S clusters (19Vanin A.F. Men'shikov G.B. Moroz I.A. Mordvintcev P.I. Serezhenkov V.A. Burbaev D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the relationship between NO and iron is clearly demonstrated by the identification of Fe-nitrosyl complexes in activated macrophages and their tumor cell targets (17Lancaster J.R. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 18Pellat C. Henry Y. Drapier J.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In these investigations, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy detected signals typical of Fe-dithiol dinitrosyl (Fe(RS)2(NO)2) complexes and heme-nitrosyl complexes (17Lancaster J.R.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The important relationship between NO and cellular iron metabolism is underlined by the fact that NO can also increase the RNA binding of iron-regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), which plays an important role in regulating intracellular iron homeostasis (for reviews see Refs. 3Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar and24Theil E.C. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1998; 35: 403-434PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of NO on IRP1-RNA binding activity occurs via two possible mechanisms, a direct effect on the [4Fe-4S] cluster and iron mobilization from cells (25Drapier J.-C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 26Weiss G. Goossen B. Doppler W. Fuchs D. Pantopoulos K. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Hentze M.W.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In terms of the ability of NO to increase iron release, we have shown that the NO produced byS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP),S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), and spermine NONOate (SperNO) can mobilize 59Fe from prelabeled cells as effectively or more effectively than the clinically used iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO) (29Wardrop S.L. Watts R.N. Richardson D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of NO-mediated iron efflux remains unknown (29Wardrop S.L. Watts R.N. Richardson D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that NO could be released from cells as a complex composed of NO, iron, and thiol-containing ligands such as cysteine or reduced GSH (23Vanin A.F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Vanin A.F. Biofizika. 1967; 12: 829-841PubMed Google Scholar, 31Woolum J.C. Tiezzi E. Commoner B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 160: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of NO-mediated iron release, we examined the energy dependence of this process. Surprisingly, we found that the metabolizable monosaccharides, d-glucose (d-Glc) and d-mannose (d-Man), can potentiate NO-mediated iron efflux from a variety of cell types. In contrast, monosaccharides that cannot be transported into cells or that are poorly metabolized (e.g. l-glucose andd-2-deoxyglucose) have no significant influence. The effect of d-Glc on potentiating NO-mediated 59Fe release is not due to any change in cellular viability or an effect ofd-Glc on NO production by the NO generators. However, these data indicate that the levels of GSH are crucial in terms of NO-mediated iron release. These results suggest that the metabolism ofd-Glc by the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMPS) and the maintenance of GSH levels are essential for NO-mediated iron mobilization. Thus, this study demonstrates that there is an important link between energy and iron metabolism and the interaction of NO. The NO generator SNAP was synthesized by established techniques (32Field, L., Dilts, R. V., Ravichandran, R., Lenhert, P. G., and Carnahan, G. E. (1978) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 249–250Google Scholar) from the precursor compound N-acetylpenicillamine (Sigma). l-Buthionine-[SR]-sulfoximine (BSO), cytochalasin B, dipyridyl, d-arabinose,d-allose, d-glucose,d-2-deoxyglucose, d-fructose,d-galactose, d-mannose, d-psicose,d-ribose, d-tagatose, d-xylose,l-glucose, GSH, GSNO, sucrose, and transferrin (Tf) were obtained from Sigma. SperNO was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Diethyl maleate (DEM) was obtained from Fluka. Minimum essential medium and RPMI 1640 with and without d-Glc were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Desferrioxamine (DFO) was obtained from Novartis Pharmaceutical Co., Basel, Switzerland. Pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) and its analogue 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311) were synthesized by standard techniques (33Richardson D.R. Tran E. Ponka P. Blood. 1995; 86: 4295-4306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of analytical reagent quality. The NO generators and other compounds were dissolved in media immediately prior to an experiment. In studies lasting more than 4 h with a NO generator, the media were replaced with fresh solutions to maintain NO levels (29Wardrop S.L. Watts R.N. Richardson D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The mouse LMTK− fibroblast cell line was obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK). The human SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cell line and murine J774 macrophage lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The human HepG2 hepatoma cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Greg Anderson (Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia). The LMTK− and SK-N-MC cell lines were grown in Eagle's modified minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (CSL Ltd., Melbourne, Australia), 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.28 μg/ml fungizone (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.). The J774 and HepG2 cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing d-Glc with the same additions as described above for minimum essential medium. Cells were grown in an incubator (Forma Scientific) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air and subcultured as described previously (35Richardson D.R. Baker E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1053: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Cellular growth and viability were monitored using phase-contrast microscopy, cell adherence to the culture substratum, and trypan blue staining. In experiments examining the effects of monosaccharides, disaccharides, or pyruvate on 59Fe release from cells, RPMI medium free ofd-Glc and pyruvate was used, and the sugars and pyruvate were added at the concentration required. The accumulation of nitrite in cell culture supernatants is commonly used as a relative measure of NO production (25Drapier J.-C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 29Wardrop S.L. Watts R.N. Richardson D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Nitrite was assayed using the Griess reagent that gives a characteristic spectral peak at 550 nm (36Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10881) Google Scholar). Cellular ATP levels were measured as described by the Sigma ATP assay kit (catalog number 366) with some modifications. In brief, two 75-cm2 culture flasks containing confluent monolayers of LMTK− fibroblasts were used for all measurements. After the appropriate incubation with the metabolic inhibitors (cyanide, azide, or rotenone) and/or d-Glc, the cells were removed by incubation in 1 mm EDTA/Ca-Mg-free phosphate-buffered saline, collected, and then counted using a Neubauer counting chamber. After this, the cells were homogenized in 0.3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and 0.3 ml of 12% trichloroacetic acid by vigorous pipetting. This solution was then placed on ice for 5 min, and the supernatant was separated from the pellet by centrifugation at 3000 rpm/10 min/4 °C. The assay was continued as described by the kit. GSH was measured using the GSH assay kit from Calbiochem. The only modifications to the protocol were that 10-fold more cells (2.4 × 107 cells/assay) were used, and the cells were disrupted using two rounds of freeze-thawing before homogenization. These modifications markedly improved the sensitivity of the technique. Apotransferrin was labeled with 59Fe (Dupont NEN) or56Fe to produce Fe2-transferrin (Tf) using standard procedures (35Richardson D.R. Baker E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1053: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In all studies, fully saturated diferric Tf was used. Unbound 59Fe or 56Fe was removed by exhaustive vacuum dialysis against 0.15 m NaCl adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1.4% NaHCO3 (35Richardson D.R. Baker E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1053: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Standard techniques were used to examine the effect of NO and other agents on the efflux of59Fe from prelabeled cells (29Wardrop S.L. Watts R.N. Richardson D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Richardson D.R. Tran E. Ponka P. Blood. 1995; 86: 4295-4306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled with 59Fe-Tf (0.75 μm) for 2 h at 37 °C in d-Glc-containing RPMI. After this incubation, the cell culture dishes were placed on a tray of ice, the medium aspirated, and the cell monolayer washed four times with ice-cold balanced salt solution. The cells were subsequently preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of the appropriate sugar, and then a final efflux incubation (2 h/37 °C) was performed in the presence or absence of the sugar and/or test reagents. After this incubation, the overlying supernatant (efflux medium) was transferred to γ-counting tubes. The cells were removed from the Petri dishes after adding 1 ml of balanced salt solution and by using a plastic spatula to detach them. Radioactivity was measured in both the cell pellet and supernatant using a γ-scintillation counter (LKB Wallace 1282 Compugamma, Finland). In some experiments the efflux medium was passed through a 5-kDa molecular mass exclusion filter (Vivaspin 500, Sartorius AG, Germany) to examine the molecular weight of the 59Fe released. Established procedures were used to examine the effect of metabolic inhibitors on 59Fe mobilization (37Huang A.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 757: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 38Richardson D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled for 3 h at 37 °C with59Fe-Tf (0.75 μm) and washed as described above. The cells were then preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with rotenone (50 μm), cyanide (5 mm), or azide (30 mm). This medium was subsequently removed, and the cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with medium containing these agents. After this, the overlying supernatant and cells were collected in separate tubes as described above. Experiments with metabolic inhibitors were performed either in the presence or absence of d-Glc. We examined the effect on 59Fe efflux of two agents that deplete GSH, namely BSO and DEM (39Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Esposito F. Cuccovillo F. Russo L. Casella F. Russo T. Cimino F. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C with BSO (0.01 mm), washed twice, and then labeled with59Fe-Tf (0.75 μm) for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed 4 times and reincubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence and absence of GSNO (0.5 mm). After this, the overlying supernatant and cells were separated and placed in γ-counting tubes. To reconstitute GSH levels, cells treated with BSO were incubated at 37 °C with N-acetylcysteine (NAC; 1 mm/20 h) (40Esposito F. Cuccovillo F. Russo L. Casella F. Russo T. Cimino F. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 41Lomonosova E.E. Kirsch M. de Groot H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), washed twice, and then labeled with 59Fe-Tf (0.75 μm) for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were subsequently washed 4 times and reincubated for 2 h at 37 °C with GSNO (0.5 mm) in the presence or absence of d-Glc. The overlying supernatant and cells were separated and transferred to γ-counting tubes. In contrast to BSO, a 20-h incubation with DEM (1 mm) was cytotoxic; therefore, cells were incubated with DEM (1 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C. By using these conditions, no toxic effects were observed. All other experimental conditions were similar to those described for BSO above. Experimental data were compared using Student's t test. Results were considered statistically significant whenp < 0.05. In initial experiments the effect ofd-Glc was examined on NO-mediated 59Fe release from prelabeled LMTK− fibroblasts. These cells were used as our primary model because the effect of NO on their iron metabolism has been well characterized in our laboratory (29Wardrop S.L. Watts R.N. Richardson D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 42Wardrop S.L. Richardson D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Prelabeling of cells with 59Fe-Tf for 2 h followed by reincubation with media without d-Glc resulted in the release of 1.5 ± 0.1% (3 determinations) of total cellular59Fe, whereas the addition of d-Glc to control medium had no effect on 59Fe mobilization (Fig.1). Reincubation of prelabeled cells with GSNO in the absence of d-Glc increased 59Fe efflux to 5.6 ± 0.2% (3 determinations), and this increased to 16.5 ± 1.4% (3 determinations) when d-Glc was added with GSNO (Fig. 1). This experiment was repeated seven times with a similar result in each case. Statistical analysis of the combined data from seven experiments demonstrated that the addition ofd-Glc to GSNO significantly increased (p < 0.00001) 59Fe release compared with GSNO alone. There was no change in cellular viability (>97%) in the presence or absence ofd-Glc and/or the NO generators, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, cell adhesion to the culture plate, and overall cellular morphology. The 59Fe released from the cells in the presence of NO was found to be less than 5 kDa, as determined by Vivaspin 500 size exclusion filters. Similar results to those reported above for GSNO were also observed for the NO generators SNAP and SperNO, suggesting that the effect was not due to the nature of the NO generator added to cells. The relevant control compounds for GSNO, SNAP, or SperNO, namely GSH,N-acetylpenicillamine, or spermine, respectively, had no effect on 59Fe release from cells as shown in our previous study (29Wardrop S.L. Watts R.N. Richardson D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, addition of d-Glc to the control compounds also had no effect on 59Fe mobilization. Addition of d-Man to GSNO also enhanced 59Fe release from cells over that seen with GSNO alone, whereasd-fructose (d-Fuc) had no effect (Fig. 1). Statistical analysis of the results from seven experiments showed that the addition of d-Man to GSNO significantly increased (p < 0.0006) 59Fe release compared with GSNO alone. It is relevant to note that d-Man can be metabolized by fibroblasts (43Yorek M.A. Stefani M.R. Dunlap J.A. Ro K.S. Davidson E.P. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 44Panneerselvam K. Etchison J.R. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23123-23129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas d-Fuc is poorly metabolized (45Delhotal B. Lemonnier F. Couturier M. Wolfrom C. Gautier M. Lemonnier A. In Vitro. 1984; 20: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To determine whether the effects observed withd-Glc and d-Man were specific to these monosaccharides, a wide variety of different aldohexoses, aldopentoses, ketohexoses, and disaccharides were examined for their ability to enhance NO-mediated 59Fe mobilization. However, from the range of sugars examined only d-Glc and d-Man were effective.

Probasin-bcl-2 transgenic mice were crossed with TRAMP (TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma Mouse Prostate) mice that express the SV40 early genes (T/t antigens) under probasin control. Prostate size, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the incidence and latency of tumor formation were evaluated. The double transgenic, probasin-bcl-2 X TRAMP F1 (BxT) mice exhibited an increase in the wet weight of the prostate. This was associated with an increase in proliferation, attributable to T/t antigens, and a decrease in apoptosis attributable to bcl-2. The latency to tumor formation was also decreased in the BxT mice compared to the TRAMP mice. The incidence of metastases was identical in both the TRAMP and BxT mice. Lastly, the incidence of hormone-independent prostate cancer was reduced in the BxT mice compared to the TRAMP mice. Together, these results demonstrate that bcl-2 can facilitate multistep prostate carcinogenesis in vivo."

The overall reaction can be divided into three partial reactions (2Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol.

Thereafter, Fe3+-NO is reduced with NADH to form a specific intermediate (I) with a Soret absorption band at 444 nm (Scheme 3) and finally reacts with the second NO to form the product, N2O (Scheme 4).We isolated P450norA and P450norB from Fusarium oxysporum (3Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and P450nor1 and P450nor2 fromCylindrocarpon tonkinense (4Usuda K. Toritsuka N. Matsuo Y. Kim D.-H. Shoun H. Appl.

These isoforms differ in terms of intracellular localization (mitochondria and cytosol). These P450nor isoforms also have different levels of specificity against electron donors. P450norA, P450norB, and P450nor1 prefer NADH as the electron donor, whereas only P450nor2 prefers NADPH to NADH, indicating that they can discriminate between NADH and NADPH and thus contain an intramolecular site for binding a reduced pyridine nucleotide. We showed from the characterization of chimeric P450norB and P450nor2 proteins that the N-terminal half is more important than the C-terminal half for determining specificity against reduced pyridine nucleotides (5Kudo T. Tomura D. Liu D.-L. Dai X.-Q. Shoun H. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).In contrast to the usual monooxygenase P450s that receive electrons from the heme-proximal side, we surmised that P450nor does so from the distal side. This characteristic should be reflected in the structure, although the crystal structure determined with respect to P450nor ofF. oxysporum was fundamentally identical to those of other P450s (6Park S.-Y. Shimizu H. Adachi S. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nakahara K. Shoun H. Obayashi E. Nakamura H. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The most unusual structure outstanding in P450nor is that a wide open space is formed in the heme-distal pocket. We assumed that this space acts as the access channel for NADH (or NADPH). The crystal structure also revealed that the heme-distal pocket is in a highly hydrophilic environment compared with those of other P450s, which contain many water molecules (6Park S.-Y. Shimizu H. Adachi S. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nakahara K. Shoun H. Obayashi E. Nakamura H. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 7Shimizu H. Obayashi E.

A specific hydrogen bond network that comprises water-74, Ser286, water-33, and Asp393 is formed when NO binds to the resting heme (Scheme 2). Water-74 is adjacent to the heme iron-bound NO, and thus the network connects the active site to the bulk solvent and would act as a proton delivery system when the Fe3+-NO complex is reduced with NADH (Scheme 3). This heme-distal pocket abnormally concentrates positively charged Lys and Arg residues, suggesting that the positively charged cluster attracts the negatively charged NADH molecule by ionic interaction. We constructed a series of P450nor mutants by site-directed mutagenesis to examine the roles of the positively charged cluster and showed that the unique structure is probably responsible for the characteristic function of P450nor, namely direct interaction with NADH.DISCUSSIONHalogen (Br−) ions exerted effects that were apparently similar to those caused by mutations at Arg or Lys residues inside the heme pocket, that is, a reverse type-1 spectral change and inhibition of the reduction step. However, the extent of spectral perturbation by mutations was not proportional to that of concomitant inactivation (Table II) but seemed to depend on the distance of the mutation site from heme. Thus, introducing a negative charge into the neighborhood of heme would cause a larger spectral perturbation. Based on this assumption, the spectral change along with the inhibition of the reduction caused by Br− arose mainly from the binding of Br− to the site near heme (Br2 in Fig. 6; anion hole). The preference of anions as the binding site for this hole to the positive charge cluster composed of Arg and Lys residues suggests that the anion hole can attract a negative charge or an electron-rich moiety. This anion hole occupies a key spot in the pocket, neighboring heme, the terminus of the positively charged cluster (Lys62), and the terminus of the proton delivery network (Ser286). These results suggest that this anion hole is the location of electron and proton transfer to the Fe3+-NO complex (Scheme 3). If so, electron transfer from NADH should be interrupted if Br− occupies this hole. On the other hand, the spectral perturbation suggests that the hydrogen bond network around heme, which contains many water molecules (7Shimizu H. Obayashi E. Gomi Y. Arakawa H. Park S.Y. Nakamura H. Adachi S. Shoun H. Shiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4816-4826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), was altered or disrupted upon the binding of Br− or mutations. Such a misalignment of the network induced in the Fe3+-NO complex would also interrupt the electron transfer that must accompany the concomitant transfer of proton(s) supported by the hydrogen-bond network (7Shimizu H. Obayashi E. Gomi Y. Arakawa H. Park S.Y. Nakamura H. Adachi S. Shoun H. Shiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4816-4826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).The discussion above implies that Br− bound at Br2 interrupts the electron transfer from NADH to heme rather than the binding of NADH. Conversely, the findings that mutations at Arg174 completely disrupted the reducing step but only slightly perturbed the heme environment (TableII) along with the results that the R174E mutant was further perturbed by Br− (Fig.2 B) are highly indicative that the mutant proteins (R174E, R174Q) were inactivated because their NADH binding ability was lost. Whether the binding or the electron transfer was disrupted could be confirmed if the K m for NADH and the maximum reduction rate could be compared between native and mutant proteins. However, we could not determine these kinetic constants with native P450nor because the reduction rate was too high even at 10 °C and was therefore beyond the capability of the instrument to analyze the rapid reaction.The Lys and Arg residues examined in this study were distributed from outside the entrance of the heme-distal pocket to the vicinities of heme (Fig. 1). The present results showed that these positively charged amino acid residues are critically important for interaction with NADH, although the extent of their contribution to the interaction would vary depending on the role of each residue. All positive charges located outside the entrance would introduce NADH to the entrance. Four of the positive charges inside the pocket (Lys62, Arg64, Arg174, and Lys291) have side chains that are oriented toward the space of the pocket. The B′-helix and the loop structure between the F- and G-helices (F-, G-loop) forms the entrance gate of the pocket, and Arg64 and Arg174 are located just beneath B′-helix and the F-, G-loop, respectively. Their side chains are opposite each other (Fig. 1). The side chain of Lys291extends upward from the bottom of the pocket, and its top reaches the vicinity of the side chain of Arg64. Thus, these residues form a positively charged barrier just beneath the entrance gate, which should immobilize the NADH molecule by placing between these residues the negatively charged pyrophosphate moiety of NAD(P)H. In addition, Lys62 should also be important for the interaction with NADH. Mutations at this site resulted in both an enormous decline of k obs (reduction) and a large spectral perturbation. Therefore, to identify whether electron transfer or binding was disturbed is difficult. Lys62 is located in the vicinity of heme within the positive cluster, and its side chain is oriented toward heme (Fig. 1). This side chain might orient an NADH molecule toward the correct direction when NADH accesses heme.The positively charged cluster should be the novel motif for interacting with NADH that is responsible for the unique catalytic property of P450nor, namely direct interaction with NAD(P)H. The motif is in sharp contrast to the Rossman fold structure (20Wirrenga R.K. De Maeyer M.C.H. Hol W.G.I. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1346-1357Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 21Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Nature. 1990; 343: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Comparisons of several crystal structures of P450 species indicate that substrate recognition site 1 (SRS-1) (according to Gotoh) (22Gotoh O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a B′-helix, is the most variable structure among P450 molecular species (23Hasemann C.A. Ravichandran K.G.

Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). This finding also appears to hold true for P450nor, as shown in Fig. 7. SRS-1 of P450nor contains 6 positive amino acid residues including 4 (Lys62, Arg64, Lys77, and Lys81) that we investigated in the present study and 3 negative groups (Glu71, Asp88, and Asp90); this is in contrast to the corresponding region of P450cam, which contains only 1 positive and 5 negative groups. The other essential residues, Arg174 and Lys291, are located in SRS-2 and SRS-5, respectively. Furthermore, Ser286 and Asp393, which are involved in the proton delivery system (6Park S.-Y. Shimizu H.

The present results indicate that P450nor has evolved to fit an interaction with NAD(P)H rather than with an organic substrate to be hydroxylated by changing mainly the amino acid residues in SRS regions. The results of the present study and others indicate that P450nor receives electrons from NADH on the distal side in contrast to other monooxygenase P450s that receive electrons on the proximal side.

Conversely, the findings that mutations at Arg174 completely disrupted the reducing step but only slightly perturbed the heme environment (TableII) along with the results that the R174E mutant was further perturbed by Br− (Fig.2 B) are highly indicative that the mutant proteins (R174E, R174Q) were inactivated because their NADH binding ability was lost. Whether the binding or the electron transfer was disrupted could be confirmed if the K m for NADH and the maximum reduction rate could be compared between native and mutant proteins.

The present results indicate that P450nor has evolved to fit an interaction with NAD(P)H rather than with an organic substrate to be hydroxylated by changing mainly the amino acid residues in SRS regions. The results of the present study and others indicate that P450nor receives electrons from NADH on the distal side in contrast to other monooxygenase P450s that receive electrons on the proximal side. Halogen (Br−) ions exerted effects that were apparently similar to those caused by mutations at Arg or Lys residues inside the heme pocket, that is, a reverse type-1 spectral change and inhibition of the reduction step. However, the extent of spectral perturbation by mutations was not proportional to that of concomitant inactivation (Table II) but seemed to depend on the distance of the mutation site from heme. Thus, introducing a negative charge into the neighborhood of heme would cause a larger spectral perturbation. Based on this assumption, the spectral change along with the inhibition of the reduction caused by Br− arose mainly from the binding of Br− to the site near heme (Br2 in Fig. 6; anion hole). The preference of anions as the binding site for this hole to the positive charge cluster composed of Arg and Lys residues suggests that the anion hole can attract a negative charge or an electron-rich moiety. This anion hole occupies a key spot in the pocket, neighboring heme, the terminus of the positively charged cluster (Lys62), and the terminus of the proton delivery network (Ser286). These results suggest that this anion hole is the location of electron and proton transfer to the Fe3+-NO complex (Scheme 3). If so, electron transfer from NADH should be interrupted if Br− occupies this hole. On the other hand, the spectral perturbation suggests that the hydrogen bond network around heme, which contains many water molecules (7Shimizu H. Obayashi E. Gomi Y. Arakawa H. Park S.Y. Nakamura H. Adachi S. Shoun H. Shiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4816-4826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), was altered or disrupted upon the binding of Br− or mutations. Such a misalignment of the network induced in the Fe3+-NO complex would also interrupt the electron transfer that must accompany the concomitant transfer of proton(s) supported by the hydrogen-bond network (7Shimizu H. Obayashi E. Gomi Y. Arakawa H. Park S.Y. Nakamura H. Adachi S. Shoun H. Shiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4816-4826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The discussion above implies that Br− bound at Br2 interrupts the electron transfer from NADH to heme rather than the binding of NADH. Conversely, the findings that mutations at Arg174 completely disrupted the reducing step but only slightly perturbed the heme environment (TableII) along with the results that the R174E mutant was further perturbed by Br− (Fig.2 B) are highly indicative that the mutant proteins (R174E, R174Q) were inactivated because their NADH binding ability was lost. Whether the binding or the electron transfer was disrupted could be confirmed if the K m for NADH and the maximum reduction rate could be compared between native and mutant proteins. However, we could not determine these kinetic constants with native P450nor because the reduction rate was too high even at 10 °C and was therefore beyond the capability of the instrument to analyze the rapid reaction. The Lys and Arg residues examined in this study were distributed from outside the entrance of the heme-distal pocket to the vicinities of heme (Fig. 1). The present results showed that these positively charged amino acid residues are critically important for interaction with NADH, although the extent of their contribution to the interaction would vary depending on the role of each residue. All positive charges located outside the entrance would introduce NADH to the entrance. Four of the positive charges inside the pocket (Lys62, Arg64, Arg174, and Lys291) have side chains that are oriented toward the space of the pocket. The B′-helix and the loop structure between the F- and G-helices (F-, G-loop) forms the entrance gate of the pocket, and Arg64 and Arg174 are located just beneath B′-helix and the F-, G-loop, respectively. Their side chains are opposite each other (Fig. 1). The side chain of Lys291extends upward from the bottom of the pocket, and its top reaches the vicinity of the side chain of Arg64. Thus, these residues form a positively charged barrier just beneath the entrance gate, which should immobilize the NADH molecule by placing between these residues the negatively charged pyrophosphate moiety of NAD(P)H. In addition, Lys62 should also be important for the interaction with NADH. Mutations at this site resulted in both an enormous decline of k obs (reduction) and a large spectral perturbation. Therefore, to identify whether electron transfer or binding was disturbed is difficult. Lys62 is located in the vicinity of heme within the positive cluster, and its side chain is oriented toward heme (Fig. 1). This side chain might orient an NADH molecule toward the correct direction when NADH accesses heme. The positively charged cluster should be the novel motif for interacting with NADH that is responsible for the unique catalytic property of P450nor, namely direct interaction with NAD(P)H. The motif is in sharp contrast to the Rossman fold structure (20Wirrenga R.K. De Maeyer M.C.H. Hol W.G.I. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1346-1357Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 21Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Nature. 1990; 343: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Comparisons of several crystal structures of P450 species indicate that substrate recognition site 1 (SRS-1) (according to Gotoh) (22Gotoh O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a B′-helix, is the most variable structure among P450 molecular species (23Hasemann C.A. Ravichandran K.G.

The soluble MMO system comprises three protein components: a 251 kDa hydroxylase (MMOH), a reductase (MMOR) that transfers electrons from NADH to MMOH, and a cofactorless regulatory protein (MMOB). Reductive activation of dioxygen and subsequent methane oxidation take place at a carboxylate-bridged diiron cluster in the active site of MMOH. The mechanism of dioxygen activation by the reduced, diiron(II) center (Hred) in soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) has received considerable attention in recent years. Studies performed with sMMO from both Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) andMethylosinus trichosporium OB3b led to the spectroscopic characterization of several kinetically competent intermediates in this reaction (Scheme FS1 and Refs. 3Lee S.-K.

The first spectroscopically detected intermediate after addition of dioxygen to the reduced protein has been assigned as a (μ-1,2-peroxo)diiron(III) species (Hperoxo) based on comparison of its optical and Mössbauer spectroscopic characteristics with those of structurally characterized model complexes (5Kim K.

O2 concentrations were determined by using a YSI 5300 biological oxygen monitor (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs OH). Gas chromatographic analyses were performed with a Hewlett Packard 5890 instrument employing a Porapak Q (6′ × 0.25 inch) column. NMR spectra were obtained at 293 K on a Varian VXR501 spectrometer (13C, 125 MHz). NADH was purchased from Sigma and used as received. Data analysis was performed with KaleidaGraph 3.0 (Synergy Software). Steady-state oxidation of acetonitrile at 22 °C was monitored optically at 340 nm, the λmax for NADH (ε = 6230m−1 cm−1). Solutions of each of the three enzyme components (MMOH, 1 nmol; MMOB, 1 nmol; MMOR, 0.2 nmol), dithiothreitol (600 nmol), and CH3CN (0–2.4 μmol) were added to a 1-ml cuvette containing sufficient buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0) to achieve a final reaction volume of 600 μl. The reaction was initiated by addition of 180 nmol of NADH followed by rapid mixing of the solution. Initial rate data were obtained during the first 150 s of the reaction, during which time the optical decay was approximately linear. Consumption of acetonitrile during these reactions was monitored by gas chromatography using a Porapak Q column (see above). The experimental apparatus for the oxygen isotope effect experiments has been described previously (17Tian G. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem.

The vessel was filled with O2-saturated buffer (25 mmMOPS, pH 7.0), MMOH (160 nmol), MMOB (160 nmol), CH3CN (0 and 160 μmol), and NADH (56 μmol) and sealed, ensuring that no air bubbles were trapped in the solution. The reaction temperature was maintained at 20 °C. Approximately 15 ml of the reaction mixture was collected twice for each experiment. The first sample was removed prior to addition of MMOR to determine the quantity and isotopic composition of dioxygen at the beginning of the experiment. Subsequently, a mixture of MMOR (40 nmol) and dithiothreitol (40 μmol) was injected into the vessel through a septum to initiate the MMO reaction. After a predetermined time period, a second sample was obtained to determine the quantity and isotopic composition of dioxygen after various extents of conversion. Collection of the dioxygen, conversion into CO2, and isotopic analysis have been described elsewhere (17Tian G. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 8891-8897Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Tian G. Berry J.A. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All binding experiments were performed at 20 °C using an YSI 5300 biological oxygen monitor. The cell was filled with 1.5 ml of air-saturated buffer, which corresponded to an O2concentration of 273 μm. To this buffer was added 150 μl of anaerobic sample via a gas-tight syringe, followed by the immediate removal of excess liquid from the overflow space. After correction for the dilution of the air-saturated buffer by anaerobic buffer, O2-uptake was calculated by the difference in O2 concentration before and after sample addition. Deoxyhemerythrin was prepared by reducing hemerythrin with excess sodium dithionite, followed by two dialysis steps against anaerobic 30 mm Tris-SO4, pH 8.2. Upon aeration, this preparation showed the optical spectrum typical of oxyhemerythrin (A 330 nm/A 500 nm = 3.2), and no significant amount of methemerythrin (25Garbett K. Darnall D.W. Klotz I.M. Williams R.J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 135: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the binding studies, a 150-μl aliquot of anaerobic deoxyhemerythrin (283 μm) in 30 mm Tris-SO4, pH 8.2 was added to 1.5 ml of air-saturated 30 mmTris-SO4, pH 8.2. Aliquots of 150 μl of anaerobic MMOH (200 μm), MMOH + MMOB (both 200 μm), or MMOH + MMOB + MMOR (all 200 μm) in 25 mmMOPS, pH 7.0 were added to 1.5 ml of air-saturated 25 mmMOPS, pH 7.0.

In these experiments, the proteins or enzymes discriminate between isotopologues in the binding or consumption of dioxygen. Prior to performing similar experiments with methane monooxygenase, it was necessary to identify a suitable hydrocarbon substrate and to characterize kinetically its sMMO-catalyzed oxidation reaction. The apparatus for measuring oxygen isotope effects necessitated the use of a liquid hydrocarbon substrate rather than methane, the physiological substrate. Therefore, CH3CN was examined as a methane substitute under steady-state oxidation conditions, with MMOH/MMOB/MMOR = 1:1:0.2 at pH 7.0 in 25 mm MOPS (26Green J. Dalton H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15795-15801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the turnover of NADH at acetonitrile concentrations ranging from 0–3.0 mm. The plot displays the expected hyperbolic dependence of reaction velocityversus [CH3CN]. The presence of a nonzero intercept on the ordinate, however, indicated that NADH was consumed even in the absence of hydrocarbon substrate. This activity corresponds to sMMO-catalyzed oxidase activity, generating water from dioxygen (Reaction 2). No H2O2 forms under these conditions (27Gassner G. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12768-12785Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).O2+2NADH+2H+→2H2O+2NAD+REACTION2To determine directly whether such oxidase activity occurs at saturating acetonitrile concentrations, the reaction was studied by monitoring the consumption of NADH, O2, and CH3CN. Consumption of NADH was followed optically by UV-visible spectroscopy, and dioxygen concentration was measured by using an oxygen electrode. Consumption of CH3CN was determined by gas chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture. The enzymatic activities measured by these different methods were identical within 10% for a given CH3CN concentration above 3 mm, showing that NADH oxidation is fully coupled to oxidation of acetonitrile under these conditions. Acetonitrile was oxidized quantitatively to glycolonitrile, HOCH2CN, as determined by monitoring the oxidation of [13C2]CH3CN by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The simplest kinetic model that can explain the competition between oxygenase and oxidase activity is shown in SchemeFS2, and the corresponding rate law is given by Equation 1.V=k0[E]T+(k2−k0)[E]T[CH3CN]KM+[CH3CN]Equation 1 Soluble MMO, represented by E, can bind CH3CN and subsequently oxidize it to form HOCH2CN with rate constantk 2. Alternatively, reducing equivalents from NADH can be used in the unproductive oxidase reaction, characterized by the kinetic rate constant k 0. At sufficiently high CH3CN concentration, all enzyme will react with CH3CN, and the reduction of dioxygen by NADH is fully coupled to the oxidation of CH3CN. At intermediate CH3CN concentrations, NADH is consumed in both the coupled and uncoupled reactions. In the absence of hydrocarbon, only the oxidase activity is observed. The kinetic parameters obtained by fitting the data to Equation 1 are k 2 = 0.32 s−1, K M = 440 μm, andk 0 = 0.12 s−1. Dioxygen is consumed in a 1:2 ratio relative to NADH in the oxidase reaction, thereforek 0 = 0.06 s−1 andk 2 = 0.32 s−1 for a rate equation based on dioxygen consumption. It should be emphasized that the model in Scheme FS2 does not accurately represent the particular sequence in which individual substrates bind, including steps involving NADH and dioxygen, or the nature of enzyme component interactions, all of which are crucial features in the detailed mechanism of sMMO (27Gassner G. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12768-12785Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For example, the kinetic constant K M does not necessarily represent the dissociation constant for CH3CN binding. Nevertheless, the model successfully accounts for the presence of uncoupled oxidase activity, including circumstances under which hydrocarbon substrates are available below kinetically saturating concentrations. In oxygen isotope effect experiments, all reactions that consume dioxygen contribute to the final isotope effect. Thus, it was important to identify conditions under which the sMMO oxidase and oxygenase reactions could be separated, to facilitate interpretation of the isotope effects.Figure FS2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Oxygen kinetic isotope effect (KIE) experiments were carried out for both sMMO-catalyzed oxidase activity in the absence of CH3CN and oxygenase activity in the presence of 4.0 mm CH3CN. Experimental procedures were similar to those described previously for other dioxygen-activating enzymes (12Francisco W.A. Tian G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 4057-4062Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Glickman M.H. Cliff S. Thiemens M. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11357-11361Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Su Q.

The reactions employed natural abundance 18O-labeled dioxygen and examined the extent of discrimination between 18O- and16O-containing dioxygen. For each experimental data point, it was necessary to determine the fraction conversion, f, namely the mole fraction of the initial dioxygen consumed in the reaction, as well as the dioxygen isotopic ratio before,R 0, and after, Rf , the reaction. Determination of these values permitted calculation of the18O isotope effect according to Equation 2 (12Francisco W.A. Tian G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 4057-4062Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 18(V/K)=1/[1+ln(Rf/R0)/ln(1−f)]Equation 2 The data obtained from these experiments are displayed in Fig.2, which reveals that the isotope effects are invariant with respect to the fraction conversion and that the magnitudes are 1.0167 ± 0.0010 and 1.0152 ± 0.0007 in the absence and presence of CH3CN, respectively. Within experimental error, the oxygen isotope effects are identical for both the oxidase and oxygenase reactions. Rapid formation of a tight MMOH·O2Michaelis complex has been implicated in single turnover studies that reveal no dioxygen concentration dependence on the decay of Hred (11Liu Y. Nesheim J.C. Lee S.-K. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24662-24665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To facilitate interpretation of the oxygen isotope effects (see below), we sought direct evidence for such noncovalent binding of dioxygen to MMOH. We reasoned that dioxygen may bind in the active site or other hydrophobic cavities identified by x-ray crystallography for MMOH (28Rosenzweig A.C. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Nordlund P. Nature. 1993; 366: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar,29Rosenzweig A.C. Brandstetter H. Whittington D.A. Nordlund P. Lippard S.J. Frederick C.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). 3D. A. Whittington, A. C. Rosenzweig, C. A. Frederick, and S. J. Lippard, submitted for publication. By using an oxygen electrode, we measured the change in soluble [O2] upon addition of an anaerobic solution of MMOHox to air-saturated buffer. No dioxygen uptake was observed for MMOH alone, MMOH + MMOB (1:1), or MMOH + MMOB + MMOR (1:1:1); all samples yielded the same results obtained upon addition of anaerobic buffer with no protein. As a positive control, we performed the same experiment with deoxyhemerythrin, which binds dioxygen covalently with aK d of ∼15–30 μm (30Stenkamp R.E. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 715-726Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Nearly stoichiometric O2 uptake was observed, the decrease in [O2] corresponding to 0.8–0.9 equivalents of O2 per hemerythrin subunit. From this experiment we can establish a lower limit for dioxygen binding by MMOHox ofK d ≥ 1 mm. Unfortunately, irreversible dioxygen reactivity prevents us from performing similar experiments with Hred. We therefore cannot completely exclude the possibility that a change in the redox state of the metal center leads to a conformational change in a putative hydrophobic binding pocket and therefore to an alteration in the O2 affinity. Nonetheless, the result for Hox is important because it proves that such a putative nonmetal O2 binding site is not preformed in the isolated form of the enzyme and, we would argue, less likely to be present in the reduced form as well. Oxygen-18 kinetic isotope effects determined in the manner described above reflect reaction steps up to and including the first irreversible step involving dioxygen. The mechanism of sMMO has been studied previously under steady-state conditions to identify the relative sequence of substrate binding and reactivity and product release (31Green J. Dalton H. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); however, specific insights into dioxygen activation steps have been obtained from pre-steady-state kinetics studies (3Lee S.-K. Nesheim J.C. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21569-21577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Liu K.E. Valentine A.M. Wang D. Huynh B.H. Edmondson D.E. Salifoglou A. Lippard S.J. J.

Two kinetically competent intermediates, Hperoxo and Q, have been characterized spectroscopically (Scheme FS1), and there is kinetic and computational evidence for additional species (6Valentine A.M. Stahl S.S. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 3876-3887Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Lee S.-K. Lipscomb J.D.

Possible identities of additional intermediates include an enzyme-dioxygen Michaelis complex (11Liu Y. Nesheim J.C. Lee S.-K. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24662-24665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), a superoxo species (10Dunietz B.D. Beachy M.D. Cao Y. Whittington D.A. Lippard S.J. Friesner R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2828-2839Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar), an isomer of Hperoxo (6Valentine A.M. Stahl S.S. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 3876-3887Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and/or a protonated peroxo species (9Lee S.-K. Lipscomb J.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4423-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Inclusion of each of these proposed intermediates yields the mechanism in Scheme FS3. The structure for Hperoxo is inferred from spectroscopically similar, structurally characterized model complexes (5Kim K. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 4914-4915Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6Valentine A.M. Stahl S.S. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 3876-3887Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic evidence strongly supports the presence of at least one oxo bridge in Q. Experimental studies have not yet established which, if any, of these steps is irreversible. The experimental data outlined above allow us to evaluate certain features of this proposed mechanism. Formation of a tight MMOH·O2 Michaelis complex has been implicated in several single turnover studies that reveal no dioxygen concentration dependence on the formation or decay of transient intermediates (3Lee S.-K. Nesheim J.C. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21569-21577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Liu K.E. Valentine A.M. Wang D. Huynh B.H. Edmondson D.E. Salifoglou A. Lippard S.J. J.

Nesheim J.C. Lee S.-K. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24662-24665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In one case, it was proposed that formation of the Michaelis complex is effectively irreversible, that is in Scheme FS3 k 2 ≫ k −1 (11Liu Y. Nesheim J.C. Lee S.-K. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24662-24665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Because noncovalent dioxygen binding in a hydrophobic cavity to generate Hred·O2 should have little effect on the O–O vibrational frequency, this step should exhibit no significant isotope effect. Consequently, this proposal is inconsistent with the present observation of a substantial oxygen-18 kinetic isotope effect. Alternatively, the mechanism may involve pre-equilibrium, tight binding of dioxygen to form Hred·O2 followed by an irreversible kinetic step, that is K 1 ≫ 1 and k −1 ≫ k 2 (3Lee S.-K. Nesheim J.C. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21569-21577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Liu K.E. Valentine A.M. Wang D. Huynh B.H. Edmondson D.E. Salifoglou A. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem.

Nesheim J.C. Lee S.-K. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24662-24665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We obtained no evidence for tight dioxygen binding with Hox. It is possible that Hred has a much higher affinity for O2 than Hox, but it would have to bind dioxygen noncovalently with affinities approaching that of covalent binding by hemerythrin to account for the experimental observations in the single turnover experiments. 4The rate constants for Hred decay monitored by freeze-quench EPR were published with approximately 10% error limits (8Nesheim J.C. Lipscomb J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10240-10247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). With the MMOH and dioxygen concentrations reported for this experiment, 125 μm and 300–700 μm, respectively, a K d ≤ 56 μm would be necessary to observe no [O2] dependence for the bimolecular reaction. Covalent binding of dioxygen by deoxyhemerythrin exhibits a K d of ∼15–30 μm (30Stenkamp R.E. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 715-726Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Even if such a noncovalent Hred·O2 complex is formed, its reversible formation would not contribute to the oxygen KIE. The magnitude of kinetic isotope effects can also provide insights into the nature of the dioxygen-activation steps (12Francisco W.A. Tian G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 4057-4062Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Su Q. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12513-12525Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18Tian G. Berry J.A. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Equilibrium isotope effects (EIE) have been calculated for the reduction of dioxygen to various species based on known vibrational frequencies for dioxygen and the corresponding products (TableI, entries 1–5). Equilibrium isotope effects have also been measured for several reversible dioxygen-binding iron proteins, including myoglobin, hemoglobin, and hemerythrin (TableI, entries 6–8, and Ref. 17Tian G. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 8891-8897Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects are not directly comparable, however, because EIE reflect changes in bond order for oxygen between two equilibrium states, whereas KIE reflect changes in bond order between reactant and the transition state. From Table I it can be inferred that a reduction in bond order of 0.5 corresponds to a discrimination of 3% between16O–16O and 18O–16O. When dioxygen reduction is accompanied by protonation or metal coordination, these effects tend to be attenuated (e.g. compare entry 2 with entries 4 and 6). The KIE of 1.015 found in the present study indicates that the bond order changes substantially in the first irreversible step, but it is not possible to identify this step based solely on the magnitude of the KIE. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that the KIE found here is consistent with a rate-limiting outer sphere electron transfer from iron to O2, followed by rapid combination of the superoxo species to afford Hsuperoxo. Formation of a superoxide species has also been proposed to be the first irreversible step in the reductive activation in a number of other oxygen-activating enzymes (12Francisco W.A. Tian G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 4057-4062Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Su Q. Klinman J.P.

Recent density functional theory (DFT) calculations have identified a possible superoxo intermediate species with an energy comparable with that of Hperoxo (10Dunietz B.D. Beachy M.D. Cao Y. Whittington D.A. Lippard S.J. Friesner R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2828-2839Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Further work is required to characterize the early dioxygen activation intermediates, clarify the relationship between kinetic and equilibrium isotope effects, and gain additional insights into the nature of the first irreversible step in the reaction.Table IEquilibrium is\tope effects for dioxygen reactionsEntryReaction18 K calc1-aCalculated values (entries 1–5) and measured values (entries 6–8) are both from Ref. 17.1O2⇌2e−O22−1.0502O2⇌1e−O2•−1.0333O2⇌2e−,1H+HO2−1.0344O2⇌1e−,1H+HO2•−1.0115O2⇌2e−,2H+H2O21.0096FeII + O2 ⇌ FeIII-OO (myoglobin)1.00547FeII + O2 ⇌ FeIII-OO (hemoglobin)1.00398FeIIFeII+O2⇌H+FeIIIFeIII­OOH(hemerythrin)1.01131-a Calculated values (entries 1–5) and measured values (entries 6–8) are both from Ref. 17Tian G.

Open table in a new tab As described above, the isotope effects for oxidase and oxygenase activity are identical (Fig. 2). This result is similar to the isotope effects in tyrosine hydroxylase, which were not affected by changes in substrate (12Francisco W.A. Tian G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 4057-4062Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, the oxygen isotope effects measured for dopamine β-monooxygenase were sensitive to the substrate identity, suggesting that substrate plays a role in the first irreversible step (18Tian G. Berry J.A. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The identical isotope effects for the oxidase and oxygenase activities suggest that the initial dioxygen activation steps are the same for both reactions. This activated oxygen species can then react either with substrate to form a hydroxylated product or can be further reduced to yield water. Like CH4 and most other hydrocarbon substrates, CH3CN probably reacts with intermediate Q (6Valentine A.M. Stahl S.S. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 3876-3887Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Oxidase activity should therefore also result from reduction of intermediate Q, with MMOR being the reducing agent, because oxygenation of CH3CN competes with this activity. If oxidase activity were the consequence of reduction of an earlier intermediate, no competition by CH3CN would be expected. Consequently, the first irreversible step in dioxygen activation must precede the decay of Q (Scheme FS3, step 6). In summary, several new insights have been obtained about the mechanism of dioxygen activation by the reduced, diiron(II) center in sMMO fromM. capsulatus (Bath). Oxygen kinetic isotope effect measurements, obtained under steady-state turnover conditions, reveal identical values for both oxidase and oxygenase reactions catalyzed by sMMO, and thus provides evidence for a common pathway of oxygen activation. The isotope effects and dioxygen binding studies do not support either the formation of an irreversible Michaelis complex between MMOH and dioxygen or a rapid reversible binding of O2. Although the origin of the isotope effect is not fully understood, one plausible scenario is the irreversible formation a superoxide adduct that subsequently converts to Hperoxo. The oxygen KIE determined in this study will be valuable in calibrating computational studies on the oxygen activation pathway (10Dunietz B.D. Beachy M.D. Cao Y. Whittington D.A. Lippard S.J.

It also inactivates bradykinin, a potent vasodilator peptide (1Corvol P. Williams T.A. Soubrier F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 283-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). There are two ACE isoforms transcribed from a single ACE gene by two alternate promoters (2Hubert C. Houot A.M. Corvol P. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15377-15383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Somatic ACE (170 kDa) is synthesized by vascular endothelial cells as well as several types of epithelial cells, whereas testis ACE (110 kDa) is expressed exclusively by male germinal cells (3El-Dorry H.A.

Invest. 1987; 56: 345-348PubMed Google Scholar). Somatic ACE consists of two homologous catalytic domains, a juxtamembrane stalk region, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain of 17 amino acids, and a 30-residue C-terminal cytosolic domain (5Soubrier F. Alhenc-Gelas F. Hubert C. Allegrini J. John M. Tregear G. Corvol P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9386-9390Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Thus ACE is primarily an integral membrane protein anchored to the plasma membrane by its C-terminal segment. But the membrane-bound enzyme can be fully solubilized in vitro by detergents or limited proteolytic cleavage (6Hooper N.M. Keen J. Pappin D.J. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In vivo, a soluble form of the enzyme exists in plasma and other body fluids (7Hooper N.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Plasma ACE is known to be strongly modulated by a common polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with an insertion/deletion polymorphism (8Rigat B. Hubert C. Alhenc-Gelas F. Cambien F. Corvol P. Soubrier F. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar). Although this quantitative trait locus (QTL) was localized on the ACEgene itself (9Villard E. Tiret L. Visvikis S. Rakotovao R. Cambien F. Soubrier F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 1268-1278PubMed Google Scholar), the functional variant has not yet been identified. Human plasma ACE is derived from endothelial cells by post-translational cleavage. Several membrane-anchored proteins are solubilized by limited proteolysis with release of their extracellular domains. This common phenomenon, also referred to as “shedding” displays typical characteristics such as induction by phorbol esters, calcium ionophores, and unidentified serum factor; inhibition of the shedding protease by hydroxamate-based metalloprotease inhibitors; localization of the shedding event at the cell surface; and structural requirements of the juxtamembrane stalk that determine cleavage efficiency (10Ehlers M.R.

Cleavage secretion of ACE is topologically constrained to an accessible stalk region of at least 11 residues in length and requires a minimum distance of 3 residues from the proximal extracellular domain and 8 residues from the membrane (10Ehlers M.R.

Furthermore, mutational analysis of the stalk region has shown that conservation of the amino acid sequence was not essential for shedding, even though the secretase seems to have a weak preference for cleavage after Arg or Lys residues (10Ehlers M.R.

In addition, experiments using the homologous stalk region of CD4 (which is not cleaved) to construct a chimeric ACE revealed that the distal extracellular domain of ACE also has a prominent role for determining the cleavage (14Sadhukhan R.

Here we report the identification of a Pro1199 → Leu mutation found associated with high plasma ACE levels in three unrelated Dutch individuals. In vitro study of this mutation was performed, and effects of this mutation on the solubilization process of ACE were investigated. We present experimental results showing that this single amino acid change in the stalk region is responsible for an enhancement of the cleavage and secretion of ACE in an ACE-secretase activity-dependent manner. A hypothesis implicating a modification of the ACE structure caused by the point mutation that leads to better accessibility for the ACE secretase is proposed. Three unrelated individuals (HOL.2, HOL.10, and HOL.19) were identified through a screening of plasma ACE levels in a population of patients referred to the hospital for various causes. The study included the measurement of several clinical, paraclinical, and biological parameters. Plasma ACE enzymatic activity was measured by a commercial kit (ACEcolor, Fujizoki Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) using Gly-His-Leu as substrate. The complete clinical report has been described in Kramers et al. 2C. Kramers, S. M. Danilov, J. Deinum, I. V. Balyasnikova, N. Scharenberg, M. Looman, F. Boomsma, M. H. De Keijzer, C. Van Duijn, S. Martin, F. Soubrier, and G. J. Adema, submitted manuscript. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), MCDB-131 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, CHAPS, and hydrocortisone were from Sigma. Fetal calf serum was from Valbiotech (Paris, France). Phosphate-buffered saline, l-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and geneticin were from Life Technologies, Inc. Human recombinant epidermal growth factor (hEGF) and EXGEN 500 were from Euromedex (Souffelweyersheim, France). Compound 3 [N-[-d,l-[2-(hydroxyaminocarbonyl)methyl]-4-methylpentanoyl]-l-3-(tert-butyl-alanyl-l- alanine, 2- aminoethyl amide) was provided by Dr. Roy A. Black, Immunex Research and Development Corp. (Seattle, WA). Genomic DNA of all subjects was used as template for PCR amplification. Specific primers were designed to amplify each of the 26 exons of the ACEgene, according to our own sequence determination and to the published data (GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers AC002345 andAF118569). The primer sequences are available upon request. Exon 25 amplification was performed with oligonucleotides 5′-CATGTTGAGCTACTTCAAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCAGTGTTCCCATCCCAG-3′ (antisense), using the following cycling parameters: one denaturation step at 95 °C, 4 min; 31 cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s); and one final elongation step at 72 °C, 10 min. Purified PCR products were submitted to direct sequencing using fluorescent dideoxyterminator (ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit, PE Biosystems) on an ABI 377 sequencer. A single Pro (CCG) to Leu (CTG) mutation at position 1199 was introduced into pACE-WT (or peACE), an expression vector containing the full-length somatic ACE cDNA controlled by the SV40 early promoter (15Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Soubrier F. Michaud A. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5540-5546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis system (QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The following oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation were used: 5′-GCAGTACAACTGGACGCTGAACTCCGCTCGC-3′ (sense); 5′-GCGAGCGGAGTTCAGCGTCCAGTTGTACTGC-3′ (antisense). Mutant cDNAs were screened by DNA sequencing. One mutant containing the desired mutation was selected and designed as pACE(Leu1199). The entire cDNA fragment of this construct was sequenced to ensure that no other mutations occurred. The same protocol was used to introduce the Pro1199 → Leu mutation into plasmid pACE-CF containing the coding sequence for the signal peptide, the C-terminal domain, and the transmembrane domain of human endothelial ACE (16Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant containing the desired mutation was designed as pACE-CF(Leu1199). pACE-WT, pACE(Leu1199), pACE-CF, and pACE-CF(Leu1199) were expressed in COS-7 cells. Transient transfections were performed by using polyethyleneimine suspension in a commercially available solution (EXGEN 500). COS-7 cells (250 × 103/well) were plated on a 6-well plate and incubated 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented by 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin and then treated with a mix containing 2 μg of plasmid, 4 μl of EXGEN 500, and NaCl (150 mm) in a final volume of 100 μl. The same protocol was used to express pACE-WT and pACE(Leu1199) in HMEC-1 (human microdermal endothelial cells transfected and immortalized with a pBR-322-based plasmid containing the coding region for the SV40 A gene product, large T antigen, Ref. 17Ades E.W.

Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that they were grown in MCDB-131 medium supplemented by 20% heat-nactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 10 ng/ml hEGF, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 6 μl of EXGEN 500 were used for transfection. Cells were incubated overnight with the transfection mix. pACE(Leu1199) was introduced by cotransfection with neomycin resistance plasmid pSV2neo into CHO cells. CHO cells (1 × 106) were plated on a 10-cm2 Petri dish, incubated 24 h, then treated with a mix containing 2.95 μg of pACE(Leu1199), 500 ng of pSV2neo, 6 μl of EXGEN 500, and NaCl (150 mm) in a final volume of 100 μl. The transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 750 μg/ml geneticin. Single colonies of primary G418-resistant transformants were assayed for the expression of pACE(Leu1199) by Western blot analysis and enzymatic assays (see below). Cell lines expressing pACE(Leu1199) were selected and purified by subcloning using limiting dilution. Establishment of a CHO cell line expressing pACE-WT has been previously described (15Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Soubrier F. Michaud A. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5540-5546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant ACE CHO cell lines with similar cellular contents of ACE activity were seeded in 60-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/dish and grown to confluency. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed as previously described (18Beldent V. Michaud A. Bonnefoy C. Chauvet M.T. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28962-28969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), except that immunoprecipitation was performed using antiserum HKE obtained from sheep immunized against pure human kidney ACE and protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). Proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and revealed by autoradiography. CHO cells expressing wild-type ACE and ACE(Leu1199) were scraped and suspended in buffer A containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 0.25m sucrose, and 5 mm MgCl2. All steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell suspension was homogenized using a glass-Teflon homogenizer for 30 s and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was solubilized in CHAPS (8 mm) and conserved as a lysosomal fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The sedimented membranes were washed with buffer A and solubilized in CHAPS (8 mm), and the supernatant was conserved as a cytosolic fraction. Cells were scraped and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then centrifuged at 1,200 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was dissolved in CHAPS (8 mm). After stirring for 12 h to solubilize the membrane-bound ACE, the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for enzymatic assays. Secreted ACE was obtained from the culture medium of transfected cells grown in serum free medium. All enzymatic studies were performed usingp-benzoyl-l-glycyl-l-histidyl-l-leucine (Hip-His-Leu, Bachem, Switzerland) as substrate. The detection and quantification of hippuric acid released from the Hip-His-Leu were performed by HPLC as previously described (15Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Soubrier F. Michaud A. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5540-5546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of Hip-His-Leu were determined from Michaelis-Menten plots using ENZFITTER software. All enzymatic studies were performed under initial rate conditions. Two different rabbit antisera were used to characterize expressed forms of ACE: antisera 3 and 4 (18Beldent V. Michaud A. Bonnefoy C. Chauvet M.T. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28962-28969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) which were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences of the C-terminal ACE (see Fig. 1). Membrane-bound and secreted ACE were collected as described above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Pall Gelman Sciences) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 150 mm glycine using a semi-dry transfer system (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was performed in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) with antiserum 3 (1:500 dilution) or antiserum 4 (1:500 dilution). The peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) (1:5000 dilution) was used as secondary antibody. The detection step was carried out with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer. Multiple alignment of domain 1 (N-terminal domain) and domain 2 (C-terminal domain) of several ACE orthologs was performed using ClustalW program (19Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). The sequence data used are available in the Swiss-Pro database under accession numbers P12821, P09470, and Q10751. Hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA), a two-dimensional structure prediction method based on the detection and comparison of the structural segments constituting the hydrophobic core of globular protein has been described elsewhere (20Lemesle-Varloot L. Henrissat B. Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Morgat A. Mornon J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 555-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 21Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J. Henrissat B. Mornon J.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). ACE sequences were submitted to HCA analysis, and domain 1 and domain 2 of ACE orthologs were aligned according to hydrophobic clusters determined by HCA plots. Optimal alignment was performed using combined data from ClustalW and HCA analysis. Three unrelated subjects with marked increases in plasma ACE levels were identified through a screening of patients referred to a general hospital (55.8, 83.8, and 86.6 units/liter). Using the colorimetric assay ACEcolor, normal values of plasma ACE fluctuate between 8.3 and 21.4 units/liter. Plasma ACE levels are 2.5–4-fold higher than highest levels found in the normal population. All other biological and paraclinical parameters measured were normal. A heterozygote point mutation was identified in exon 25 of the ACE gene. This point mutation is a C-T transition, introducing a leucine in position 1199 instead of a proline found normally at this position (Fig.1). No other mutation was present inACE gene exons from these subjects. Cotransmission of high plasma ACE levels and the Pro1199 → Leu mutation was observed in the family, although this mutation was not found in a large sample of Dutch subjects (Kramers et al.).2 To elucidate the mechanism by which this mutation was responsible for the high plasma ACE levels observed in these individuals, an in vitro study using site-directed mutagenesis was undertaken. The expression plasmid pACE-WT (or peACE) was used to direct the synthesis of wild-type ACE (16Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression plasmid pACE(Leu1199) is identical to pACE-WT except for a single Pro (CCG) to Leu (CTG) mutation at position 1199 of the coding sequence of somatic ACE and was used to direct the synthesis of [Leu1199]ACE. The kinetic parameters for Hip-His-Leu hydrolysis of the wild-type ACE and of the [Leu1199]ACE, calculated from a Michaelis-Menten plot, were not significantly different (Fig.2). The Km and theV max values of the [Leu1199]ACE were similar to that of the wild-type ACE (3.33 ± 0.11 mm versus 2.51 ± 0.12 mm and 0.35 ± 0.007 nmol/ml/min−1 versus0.34 ± 0.008 nmol/ml/min−1). Both plasmids were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells for comparing the ability of cells to secrete [Leu1199]ACE with that of the wild-type ACE (Fig. 3, A,C, and E). Transfected cells were grown in serum-free medium for indicated times before the ACE enzymatic activity was measured with a Hip-His-Leu substrate by HPLC. No significant difference was observed in levels of cell-associated ACE between the wild-type form and [Leu1199]ACE during the time-course study (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, levels of soluble [Leu1199]ACE activity were higher than wild-type ACE suggesting that the rate of release was enhanced (Fig. 3 C). The percentage of solubilization, which was defined as the ratio of the enzymatic activity in the medium to the total enzymatic activity (medium + cells) was in average 1.5-fold higher for [Leu1199]ACE, as compared with wild-type ACE in COS-7 cells with a maximum difference of 2.5-fold at 24 h (Fig.3 E). We also investigated the rate of secretion of [Leu1199]ACE in HMEC-1, an endothelial cell line, which does not express ACE, because endothelium is a major site of expression of ACE in vivo and the source for plasma ACE (Fig. 3;B, D, and F). Higher levels of soluble [Leu1199]ACE activity were observed, as compared with wild-type ACE, and lower cell associated ACE activity was observed. The rate of solubilization was in average 2.5-fold higher for [Leu1199]ACE compared with the wild-type form. These data showed that a leucine in position 1199 instead of a proline in ACE protein leads to an enhancement of cleavage and secretion of ACE. Thus, both in an endothelial cell type and a nonendothelial cell type, differences between wild-type ACE and [Leu1199]ACE release observed in vitro are consistent with the plasma ACE increase observed in subjects bearing this mutation. CHO cells stably transfected with the expression plasmid pACE-WT or pACE(Leu1199) were used to investigate the role of the Pro1199 → Leu mutation on ACE secretion. Cells were labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased in serum-free medium for the indicated periods of time (Fig.4). Affinity precipitates of cell lysates of transfected cells revealed two bands of immunoreactive ACE around 170 kDa. The lower band, which disappeared after 24 h of chase, corresponds to the underglycosylated form of ACE, and the upper band, which appeared at 1 h of chase, corresponds to the glycosylated form of ACE. The secreted [Leu1199]ACE appeared earlier than soluble wild-type ACE at 4 h of chase (Fig. 4 B), whereas only traces of soluble wild-type ACE were visible after 8 h of chase (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, soluble [Leu1199]ACE increased rapidly in contrast with wild-type ACE, which was difficult to detect in the medium even after 16 h of chase. The metabolic labeling results were consistent with the kinetic experiments based on ACE activity, indicating that [Leu1199]ACE was released more efficiently from the cell surface than wild-type ACE. To test whether the Pro1199 → Leu mutation influences the intracellular trafficking of ACE, distribution of ACE was determined in various compartments of CHO cells stably transfected with either wild-type ACE or [Leu1199]ACE grown for 3 or 24 h in serum-free medium. Medium was then collected, and lysosomal, cytosolic, and membranous compartments were separated by successive centrifugations. ACE activity was measured in each fraction and expressed as percentage of total ACE activity (Fig.5). We determined that total ACE activity was equivalent for wild-type ACE and [Leu1199]ACE. ACE activity measured in the cytosol for wild-type ACE and [Leu1199]ACE was very low, indicating that these proteins are rapidly addressed to the membrane. A higher proportion of total ACE (38.6 ± 8.5% for wild-type ACE and 24.9 ± 9.7% for [Leu1199]ACE at 3 h) was detected in lysosomal fraction. At 3 h (Fig. 5 A) only 6% of total [Leu1199]ACE was detected in membranous compartment, whereas high levels of [Leu1199]ACE (34% of total ACE) was observed in the medium. At the same time, wild-type ACE levels were similar in membranous compartment and medium (17 and 16% of total ACE respectively). This difference between [Leu1199]ACE and wild-type ACE was more pronounced at 24 h (Fig.5 B). To map the cleavage site of [Leu1199]ACE, Western blot analyses using specific antibodies were performed (Fig. 6). Antiserum 3 was raised against sequences from the C-terminal side of the Arg1203↓Ser1204 cleavage site (22Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and antiserum 4 was directed against a synthetic peptide located at the N-terminal side of this cleavage site (Fig. 1). CHO cells stably transfected with either wild-type ACE and [Leu1199]ACE were grown to subconfluence and then incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h. Medium and CHAPS-solubilized cell lysates were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gel followed by Western blotting. Antiserum 3 failed to recognize wild-type or [Leu1199]ACE secreted in the medium, indicating that cleavage occurred before amino acid 1214. In contrast antiserum 4 was able to recognize the soluble form of wild-type and [Leu1199]ACE, indicating that cleavage occurred after amino acid 1162. Both antisera recognized wild-type and [Leu1199]membrane-bound ACE. To document the involvement of the already characterized ACE secretase in increased shedding of [Leu1199]ACE, we investigated the effects of compound 3 on the [Leu1199]ACE solubilization process. Transfected cells were grown in a serum-free medium containing (or not) compound 3 (50 μm), and the time course of secretion was investigated over a 48 h period (Fig.7 A). After 3 h, 31% of [Leu1199]ACE was secreted from the untreated cells, whereas in compound 3-treated cells, only 4% of [Leu1199]ACE was secreted at the same time. This effect was still observed after 48 h of treatment. So compound 3 inhibited [Leu1199]ACE to the same extent that it inhibited wild-type ACE secretion. COS-7 cells were transfected with wild-type ACE and [Leu1199]ACE and were thereafter grown in serum-free medium containing (or not) PMA (500 nm). The time course of secretion was investigated over a 3-h period (Fig. 7 B). PMA enhanced the rate of [Leu1199]ACE cleavage secretion considerably. For example, after 3 h, 55% of [Leu1199]ACE was secreted from the PMA-treated cells, whereas, in untreated cells, only 20% of [Leu1199]ACE was secreted at the same time. We observed a significant difference in solubilization of PMA-treated cells compared with untreated cells as early as 15 min after treatment. No similar effect was observed with wild-type ACE secretion. The possible effect of the N-terminal domain on [Leu1199]ACE solubilization was investigated using expression plasmid pACE-CF containing full-length somatic ACE cDNA except the coding sequence for the N-terminal domain (16Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pACE-CF and pACE-CF(Leu1199) were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 8 A). At 6 h, nearly 50% of ACE-CF was solubilized in medium whereas at the same time only 20% of wild-type somatic ACE was secreted (compare Figs. 3 Eand 8 A), confirming the lower solubilization of the two domain-containing enzyme. We observed a significantly higher rate of release for [Leu1199]ACE-CF as compared with ACE-CF after 1 h (31 versus 7%, respectively). The percentage of solubilization was in average 1.8-fold higher for [Leu1199]ACE-CF as compared with ACE-CF in COS-7 cells. We also investigated the effect of PMA on ACE-CF and [Leu1199]ACE-CF solubilization. (Fig. 8 B). PMA enhanced the rate of solubilization of ACE-CF and [Leu1199]ACE-CF. After 15 min, 14% of ACE-CF and 62% of [Leu1199]ACE-CF were secreted from PMA-treated cells, whereas in untreated cells only 5% of ACE-CF and 20% of [Leu1199]ACE-CF were solubilized at the same time. A PMA effect was more pronounced on [Leu1199]ACE-CF solubilization in the early times of a kinetic analysis, but the difference was less evident between ACE-CF and [Leu1199]ACE-CF after 2 h. The HCA plots of domain 1 (N-terminal domain) and domain 2 (C-terminal domain) of several ACE orthologs were compared to produce an optimal alignment. Fig.9 shows this alignment for the region of interest, i.e. close to proline 1199. HCA plots revealed that the shape of the hydrophobic cluster immediately upstream of this proline is typical of a β-strand, which would presumably end at that particular proline. An insertion of"

The initiating coagulation protease factor VIIa (VIIa) differs by remaining in a zymogen-like conformation that confers the control of catalytic activity to the obligatory cofactor and receptor tissue factor (TF). This study demonstrates that the unusual hydrophobic Met156residue contributes to the propensity of the VIIa protease domain to remain in a zymogen-like conformation. Mutation of Met156to Gln, which is found in the same position of the highly homologous factor IX, had no influence on the amidolytic and proteolytic activity of TF-bound VIIa. Furthermore, the mutation did not appreciably stabilize the labile Ile16-Asp194 salt bridge in the absence of cofactor. VIIaGln156 had increased affinity for TF, consistent with a long range conformational effect that stabilized the cofactor binding site in the VIIa protease domain. Notably, in the absence of cofactor, amidolytic and proteolytic function of VIIaGln156 were enhanced 3- and 9-fold, respectively, compared with wild-type VIIa. The mutation thus selectively influenced the catalytic activity of free VIIa, identifying the Met156 residue position as a determinant for the zymogen-like properties of free VIIa.

VIIa circulates in the blood plasma as zymogen as well as the cleaved two-chain enzyme (2Seligsohn U. Kasper C.K. Osterud B. Rapaport S.I.

TF has two distinct effects that regulate proteolysis by VIIa. First, TF provides affinity for macromolecular substrate by contributing to an extended exosite together with the bound VIIa γ-carboxyglutamic acid-rich (Gla) domain. This exosite is a binding site for the factor X Gla-domain (3Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol.

In the absence of cofactor, VIIa has only very low catalytic activity toward small peptidyl substrate mimetics and TF stimulates the amidolytic of VIIa up to 100-fold (1Ruf W. Dickinson C.D.

Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (604) Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of an activating canonical salt bridge of Asp194 with the newly generated amino-terminal Ile16. In the absence of cofactor, VIIa shows an increased susceptibility of the amino terminus to chemical modification (8Higashi S. Nishimura H. Aita K. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18891-18898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating exposure of Ile16that can result from an alternative conformation or increased flexibility and disorder in the activation pocket of free VIIa.

J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutational studies also failed to elucidate the basis for the labile enzyme conformation, because the approaches taken mainly probed the active enzyme in the TF·VIIa complex (16Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).This study investigates the role of residue Met156 in maintaining the zymogen-like conformation of VIIa. This residue is located within the activation pocket, covering Ile16 upon amino-terminal insertion (9Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The conformation of the 156 side chain can influence the catalytic activity of serine protease domains. In the case of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (17Renatus M. Engh R.A. Stubbs M.T. Huber R. Fischer S. Kohnert U. Bode W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4797-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol.

Schleuning W.-D. Bode W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13483-13493Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), Lys156 can substitute for Ile16 to form an activating salt bridge with Asp194, resulting in efficient catalysis in the absence of zymogen cleavage. However, Lys at this position is found in a large number of serine proteases without conferring catalytic activity in the zymogen precursors, indicating that multiple interactions within the activation pocket determine the activation state of serine protease domains. Although Lys or other hydrophilic side chains are predominant in serine proteases that undergo spontaneous ordering of the activation pocket upon zymogen cleavage, VIIa has a Met residue in the 156 position. We hypothesized that the side-chain property of Met156 is one of the determinants that interfere with the acquisition of full catalytic activity of VIIa upon zymogen cleavage. This study demonstrates that replacement of Met156 with Gln, the side chain found in factor IX, had little effect on the activity of TF-bound VIIa. However, free VIIaGln156 had enhanced catalytic function toward macromolecular and small peptidyl substrates. These experiments thus identify the first residue side chain that is one of the determinants for the zymogen-like conformation of the VIIa protease domain.DISCUSSIONThe zymogen-like conformation of VIIa is required to subject the regulation of VIIa's catalytic activity under strict control of the cell surface expression of the cofactor TF. The labile enzyme conformation of VIIa allows for the presence of significant amounts of the two-chain enzyme in the circulating blood and thus for the initiation of the coagulation pathways, as soon as the cofactor is exposed upon disruption of vascular integrity. This mechanism of triggering an enzyme cascade differs from the activation of the fibrinolytic system by tPA, which utilizes a catalytically active zymogen for the initial proteolytic events. Whereas an activating salt bridge of Lys156 with Ile16 has been defined as the structural basis for the active zymogen conformation of tPA (17Renatus M. Engh R.A. Stubbs M.T. Huber R. Fischer S. Kohnert U. Bode W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4797-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,18Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), structural determinants for the labile enzyme conformation of VIIa remained unclear from previous structural and mutational studies. Here, we provide evidence that the hydrophobic Met156 residue side chain within the activation pocket, in part, is responsible for the zymogen-like conformation of the VIIa protease domain.Replacement of Met156 by Gln, the side chain found in factor IX, did not appreciably influence catalytic function of the TF-bound enzyme toward small chromogenic substrates or the macromolecular substrate factor X. Thus, the cofactor-stabilized, active conformation of VIIa does not absolutely require a Met side chain at this position. Backbone-superimposition of the structures of porcine factor IXa (28Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and VIIa in the TF·VIIa complex (9Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) demonstrate that essentially the same space is occupied by the Met and Gln side chains in the respective proteases, providing a structural rational why the Gln replacement is permissive for function of the TF-bound VIIa. However, free VIIaGln156 displayed increased function compared with wild-type VIIa. First, the mutant had higher affinity for TF and affinity was not appreciably influenced by active site inhibitor binding that typically slows dissociation for wild-type VIIa and for most of the previously characterized mutants (15Dickinson C.D. Shobe J. Ruf W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cofactor binding site of VIIaGln156 thus appears to be altered, indicating a long range conformational change of the residue replacement of Met156 by Gln in the activation pocket. Second, VIIaGln156 had higher amidolytic and proteolytic activity in the absence of cofactor. Amidolytic activity was enhanced 3-fold, although activation of factor X was increased 9-fold in the presence or absence of phospholipid. The difference in enhancement may result from an additional ordering of regions that influence macromolecular substrate scissile bond cleavage, but not the hydrolysis of p-nitroanilide chromogenic substrates, which bind primarily to the S1-S3 subsites of the catalytic cleft.Because stabilization of the amino-terminal Ile16-Asp194 salt bridge is generally considered to be the major determinant for the activation state of the VIIa protease domain, it was surprising that chemical modification of the amino-terminal Ile16 in free VIIaGln156was little different from wild-type VIIa. However, we have found poor correlation of cofactor-mediated catalytic enhancement and susceptibility of the amino terminus to chemical modification in a number of other VIIa mutants (29Petrovan R.J. Ruf W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14457-14463Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Most importantly, certain mutations in the TF binding interface of the VIIa protease domain resulted in a complete failure to show protection of the amino terminus upon cofactor binding, but TF was still able to enhance amidolytic activity of these VIIa mutants by >10-fold. Stabilization of the insertion of the amino terminus, as measured by the susceptibility to chemical modification, is thus not absolutely required for changes in catalytic function of VIIa to occur.The local environment at the 156 position in VIIa differs from other homologous coagulation factors such as factor IXa. Although porcine factor IXa has a hydrophobic Ile residue in the 154 position along with a pair of charged residues at position 21 (Asn) and 156 (Gln), VIIa has a charged Glu154 and a pair of hydrophobic residues, i.e. Val21 and Met156(Fig. 2 A). One or two water molecules (not shown) are consistently resolved between the Glu154 and Met156 side chain in structures of the TF·VIIa complex (9Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 10Zhang E. St. Charles R. Tulinsky A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2089-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows Met156 replaced by Gln in one possible rotamer position that orients the amide of the Gln side chain toward Glu154. The low catalytic function of acidic side chain replacement mutants and the high functional activity of amide counterparts (Table I) indirectly supports the notion that such an orientation of the introduced Gln156 is most compatible with optimal activity. The charge complementarity of the Gln156 and Glu154 side chains may stabilize the local conformation of this region in free VIIaGln156, possibly involving the coordination of a water molecule between the two side chains. The activating effect of the Gln156 mutation may thus be mediated through an effect on the Glu154 position rather than the adjacent amino-terminal insertion.In wild-type VIIa, Ala mutation of Glu154 reduces amidolytic function 3-fold and proteolytic function 6- to 10-fold, displaying some divergence of the mutational effect on amidolyticversus proteolytic function (30Shobe J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The free Gln156 mutant showed functional enhancement of similar magnitude in both assays, arguing in favor of a function linkage between Glu154 and Gln156 in VIIaGln156. Glu154 together with the adjacent Leu153 side chain are within a “hot spot” that is known to allosterically regulate VIIa's catalytic activity. First, Glu154 is located within the epitope of an inhibitory monoclonal antibody and crucial for the inhibitory allosteric switch induced by this exosite inhibitor (30Shobe J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Second, a small peptide inhibitor of VIIa binds to an epitope that includes Leu153(13Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C. Skelton N.J. Ultsch M.H. Santell L. Dwyer M.A. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This exosite inhibitor influences catalytic function by a major reorientation of the 142–154 “autolysis” loop that also contains specific residues involved in extended macromolecular substrate recognition (20Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11631-11636Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The 142–154 loop is considered part of the activation domain, and stabilization and ordering of this loop is essential for the zymogen to enzyme transition. Structural studies on prothrombin derivatives (31Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) further suggest that the 142–154 loop can behave as a partially autonomous region of the activation domain. The enhanced function of VIIaGln156 in the absence of a stabilization of the amino-terminal insertion is thus consistent with a conformational effect on the 142–154 loop through the proximity of Glu154 with Gln156.This study identifies the first residue side chain that contributes to the zymogen-like state of free VIIa. Although the single side chain replacement was insufficient to confer complete spontaneous ordering and full catalytic activity of the VIIa protease domain, the proposed stabilization of the 142–154 loop would achieve one of the necessary conformation orderings in the activation domain. The significantly improved function of free VIIaGln156 argues that a limited number of side chains may be responsible for retaining VIIa in the zymogen-like conformation. Whether changing the local environment of the activation pocket is sufficient to achieve a fully active VIIa or whether changes in the unique loop segments that contact TF are also required remain important questions for further studies. Allosteric regulation of catalytic activity of the serine protease factor VIIa (VIIa)1 is utilized as a mechanism to control the initiation of the coagulation pathways (1Ruf W. Dickinson C.D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). VIIa circulates in the blood plasma as zymogen as well as the cleaved two-chain enzyme (2Seligsohn U. Kasper C.K. Osterud B. Rapaport S.I. Blood. 1979; 53: 828-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but proteolytic function only ensues upon binding to its cell surface receptor and catalytic cofactor tissue factor (TF). TF has two distinct effects that regulate proteolysis by VIIa. First, TF provides affinity for macromolecular substrate by contributing to an extended exosite together with the bound VIIa γ-carboxyglutamic acid-rich (Gla) domain. This exosite is a binding site for the factor X Gla-domain (3Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6375-6381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Huang Q.L. Neuenschwander P.F. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1957-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Second, TF enhances catalytic activity by allosteric effects on the VIIa protease domain. In the absence of cofactor, VIIa has only very low catalytic activity toward small peptidyl substrate mimetics and TF stimulates the amidolytic of VIIa up to 100-fold (1Ruf W. Dickinson C.D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, macromolecular substrate factor X scissile bond catalysis is enhanced >1000-fold (6Ruf W. Rehemtulla A. Morrissey J.H. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2158-2166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that cofactor-induced conformational changes may influence extended macromolecular substrate recognition regions in addition to the S1-S3 subsite 2S denotes subsite numbering according to Schechter and Berger (32Schechter I.

The 142–154 loop is considered part of the activation domain, and stabilization and ordering of this loop is essential for the zymogen to enzyme transition. Structural studies on prothrombin derivatives (31Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) further suggest that the 142–154 loop can behave as a partially autonomous region of the activation domain. The enhanced function of VIIaGln156 in the absence of a stabilization of the amino-terminal insertion is thus consistent with a conformational effect on the 142–154 loop through the proximity of Glu154 with Gln156.This study identifies the first residue side chain that contributes to the zymogen-like state of free VIIa. Although the single side chain replacement was insufficient to confer complete spontaneous ordering and full catalytic activity of the VIIa protease domain, the proposed stabilization of the 142–154 loop would achieve one of the necessary conformation orderings in the activation domain. The significantly improved function of free VIIaGln156 argues that a limited number of side chains may be responsible for retaining VIIa in the zymogen-like conformation. Whether changing the local environment of the activation pocket is sufficient to achieve a fully active VIIa or whether changes in the unique loop segments that contact TF are also required remain important questions for further studies. The zymogen-like conformation of VIIa is required to subject the regulation of VIIa's catalytic activity under strict control of the cell surface expression of the cofactor TF. The labile enzyme conformation of VIIa allows for the presence of significant amounts of the two-chain enzyme in the circulating blood and thus for the initiation of the coagulation pathways, as soon as the cofactor is exposed upon disruption of vascular integrity. This mechanism of triggering an enzyme cascade differs from the activation of the fibrinolytic system by tPA, which utilizes a catalytically active zymogen for the initial proteolytic events. Whereas an activating salt bridge of Lys156 with Ile16 has been defined as the structural basis for the active zymogen conformation of tPA (17Renatus M. Engh R.A. Stubbs M.T. Huber R. Fischer S. Kohnert U. Bode W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4797-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,18Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), structural determinants for the labile enzyme conformation of VIIa remained unclear from previous structural and mutational studies. Here, we provide evidence that the hydrophobic Met156 residue side chain within the activation pocket, in part, is responsible for the zymogen-like conformation of the VIIa protease domain. Replacement of Met156 by Gln, the side chain found in factor IX, did not appreciably influence catalytic function of the TF-bound enzyme toward small chromogenic substrates or the macromolecular substrate factor X. Thus, the cofactor-stabilized, active conformation of VIIa does not absolutely require a Met side chain at this position. Backbone-superimposition of the structures of porcine factor IXa (28Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and VIIa in the TF·VIIa complex (9Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) demonstrate that essentially the same space is occupied by the Met and Gln side chains in the respective proteases, providing a structural rational why the Gln replacement is permissive for function of the TF-bound VIIa. However, free VIIaGln156 displayed increased function compared with wild-type VIIa. First, the mutant had higher affinity for TF and affinity was not appreciably influenced by active site inhibitor binding that typically slows dissociation for wild-type VIIa and for most of the previously characterized mutants (15Dickinson C.D. Shobe J. Ruf W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cofactor binding site of VIIaGln156 thus appears to be altered, indicating a long range conformational change of the residue replacement of Met156 by Gln in the activation pocket. Second, VIIaGln156 had higher amidolytic and proteolytic activity in the absence of cofactor. Amidolytic activity was enhanced 3-fold, although activation of factor X was increased 9-fold in the presence or absence of phospholipid. The difference in enhancement may result from an additional ordering of regions that influence macromolecular substrate scissile bond cleavage, but not the hydrolysis of p-nitroanilide chromogenic substrates, which bind primarily to the S1-S3 subsites of the catalytic cleft. Because stabilization of the amino-terminal Ile16-Asp194 salt bridge is generally considered to be the major determinant for the activation state of the VIIa protease domain, it was surprising that chemical modification of the amino-terminal Ile16 in free VIIaGln156was little different from wild-type VIIa. However, we have found poor correlation of cofactor-mediated catalytic enhancement and susceptibility of the amino terminus to chemical modification in a number of other VIIa mutants (29Petrovan R.J. Ruf W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14457-14463Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Most importantly, certain mutations in the TF binding interface of the VIIa protease domain resulted in a complete failure to show protection of the amino terminus upon cofactor binding, but TF was still able to enhance amidolytic activity of these VIIa mutants by >10-fold. Stabilization of the insertion of the amino terminus, as measured by the susceptibility to chemical modification, is thus not absolutely required for changes in catalytic function of VIIa to occur. The local environment at the 156 position in VIIa differs from other homologous coagulation factors such as factor IXa. Although porcine factor IXa has a hydrophobic Ile residue in the 154 position along with a pair of charged residues at position 21 (Asn) and 156 (Gln), VIIa has a charged Glu154 and a pair of hydrophobic residues, i.e. Val21 and Met156(Fig. 2 A). One or two water molecules (not shown) are consistently resolved between the Glu154 and Met156 side chain in structures of the TF·VIIa complex (9Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 10Zhang E. St. Charles R. Tulinsky A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2089-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows Met156 replaced by Gln in one possible rotamer position that orients the amide of the Gln side chain toward Glu154. The low catalytic function of acidic side chain replacement mutants and the high functional activity of amide counterparts (Table I) indirectly supports the notion that such an orientation of the introduced Gln156 is most compatible with optimal activity. The charge complementarity of the Gln156 and Glu154 side chains may stabilize the local conformation of this region in free VIIaGln156, possibly involving the coordination of a water molecule between the two side chains. The activating effect of the Gln156 mutation may thus be mediated through an effect on the Glu154 position rather than the adjacent amino-terminal insertion. In wild-type VIIa, Ala mutation of Glu154 reduces amidolytic function 3-fold and proteolytic function 6- to 10-fold, displaying some divergence of the mutational effect on amidolyticversus proteolytic function (30Shobe J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The free Gln156 mutant showed functional enhancement of similar magnitude in both assays, arguing in favor of a function linkage between Glu154 and Gln156 in VIIaGln156. Glu154 together with the adjacent Leu153 side chain are within a “hot spot” that is known to allosterically regulate VIIa's catalytic activity. First, Glu154 is located within the epitope of an inhibitory monoclonal antibody and crucial for the inhibitory allosteric switch induced by this exosite inhibitor (30Shobe J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Second, a small peptide inhibitor of VIIa binds to an epitope that includes Leu153(13Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C.

Reduced expression of the <i>LDLR</i> is believed to be a precipitating factor in the pathogenesis of type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) in some humans homozygous for the apoE2 allele (<i>APOE*2</i>). To test the effect of genetic changes in LDL receptor expression on the pathogenesis of type III HLP, we have generated a variant allele at the endogenous mouse <i>Ldlr</i> locus that expresses the human LDL receptor transcript. Transcription of the human <i>LDLR</i> minigene is regulated by the endogenous mouse promoter sequence, but a truncation of 3′-untranslated region results in increased mRNA stability. Consequently, in liver of heterozygotes, steady state levels of mouse and human <i>LDLR</i> transcripts are 50 and 180% the levels of total transcript in wild type mice, respectively. Overall, the 2.3-fold normal level of <i>LDLR</i> message in heterozygotes completely ameliorates type III HLP caused by the homozygosity for the human <i>APOE*2</i> allele, normalizing their plasma lipoprotein profile. We conclude that a modest increase in expression of the<i>LDLR</i> through message stabilization is sufficient to prevent precipitation of type III HLP in mice."

Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). One major class of lipid modification is termed prenylation, in which either a 15-carbon farnesyl or 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoid is covalently attached via a thioether bond to cysteine residue(s) at or near the C terminus of the protein (2Zhang F.L.

The majority of prenylated proteins contain the so-called CaaX motif, which is defined by the presence of a cysteine residue fourth from the C terminus of the protein to which the isoprenoid is attached (4Fu H.W. Casey P.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1999; 54: 315-343PubMed Google Scholar). CaaXproteins are subject to additional modifications after prenylation in that the three C-terminal residues are proteolytically removed, and the new C-terminal prenylcysteine is subject to carboxyl methylation (4Fu H.W.

Prenylation is a stable modification, and these proteins can comprise up to 2% of total cellular protein (6Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The quantity of prenylated protein in cells, as well as the stability of the modification, raises a metabolic challenge to the cell in the disposal of prenylcysteines resulting from the normal turnover of these proteins.S-Acylation, another lipid post-translational modification, raises a similar metabolic challenge to the cell. An enzyme termed palmitoyl protein thioesterase removes the palmitoyl group from thiol-containing compounds arising from the degradation of palmitoylated proteins (8Lu J.Y. Verkruyse L.A. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These findings in particular have highlighted an important role for enzymes involved in the metabolism of lipidated proteins. In a continuing effort to understand the metabolic fate of prenylcysteines produced during turnover of prenylated proteins, we identified and cloned a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of prenylcysteines (10Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This enzyme, dubbed prenylcysteine lyase (PCLase),1 degrades prenylcysteines to yield free cysteine and an unidentified isoprenoid product (10Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The production of free cysteine (i.e.containing a reduced sulfhydryl) and the lack of a NAD(P)H requirement suggested that PCLase utilizes a mechanism distinct from enzymes such as the carbon-sulfur β-lyase and cytochrome P450- and flavin-containing monooxygenases known to cleave carbon-sulfur bonds (10Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additionally, PCLase has essentially no sequence similarity to known enzymes, suggesting that it might possess a novel mechanism for carbon-sulfur bond cleavage (11Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, the unusual mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by PCLase was investigated. Farnesal was synthesized with modification using farnesol as described (12Leopold E.J. Org. Synth. Coll. 1990; 7: 258-263Google Scholar). [35S]Farnesylcysteine (FC) and [1-14C]FC were synthesized as described (10Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Native PCLase was purified from bovine brain as described (10Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) was obtained from Sigma. 7-Diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin was obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. Recombinant PCLase was produced by infection of Sf9 cells with a recombinant baculovirus containing the PCLase cDNA using a variation of the previously published procedure (11Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Specifically, histidine-tagged PCLase was produced by insertion of six histidines between residues 496 and 497 in the C-terminal region of PCLase using the Gene Editor kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions; the previously described pFastBac/PCLase construct (11Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was used as a template for mutagenesis. Recombinant baculovirus containing this His6-PCLase variant was produced using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and was used to infect Sf9 cells as described previously (11Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) except that serum-free media was used, and the cells were harvested at 48 h post-infection. Recombinant His6-PCLase was purified from extracts of infected Sf9 cells by a combination of nickel-affinity and anion-exchange chromatography. The cell pellet from a 4-liter culture of infected Sf9 cells was resuspended in 40 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (13Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were disrupted, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. PCLase was extracted from the resulting pellet with 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitor mixture, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), the column was washed with 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), and 5 mm imidazole, and PCLase eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient of imidazole (5–500 mm) in the above buffer. Fractions containing PCLase activity were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, containing 0.2% CHAPS (Buffer A), and the dialysate loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with Buffer A. PCLase was eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 500 mm in Buffer A. Fractions containing PCLase were pooled, dialyzed as above, flash-frozen in aliquots, and stored at −80 °C until use. Purified bovine PCLase (120 ng) was incubated with 6.66 μm [14C]FC (∼50 mCi/mmol) in 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, 15% glycerol, 0.02% CHAPS, and 10 mm Zwittergent 3–14 for 30 min at 37 °C. In some reactions, semicarbazide was added to a final concentration of 40 mm after the enzymatic reaction, and the incubation was continued for 30 min at 37 °C. Prior to HPLC analysis, 10 nmol of unlabeled farnesylcysteine, farnesal, and the semicarbazide adduct of farnesal were added to provide internal standards. Samples were chromatographed on a C18 reverse-phase column with a 45-min gradient from 10 to 100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% triflouroacetic acid. Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation spectroscopy. The elution positions of the isoprenoid standards were determined by monitoring absorbance at 210 nm. PCLase (300 nm) and reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, containing 5 μm [35S]FC) were deoxygenated by bubbling argon through the solutions. The solutions were then mixed and incubated at 37 °C under argon. Aliquots (20 μl) were removed and quenched with the solvent used for thin-layer chromatography (n-propanol:NH4OH:H2O (6:3:1); 10 μl) at indicated times. At the time indicated in Fig. 2, the reaction chamber was opened to air, and additional aliquots were taken and reactions quenched as described above. Accumulation of the product [35S]cysteine was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography as described (10Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The visible spectrum of a 12 μm solution of PCLase in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.2% CHAPS was recorded on a Hewlett Packard diode-array spectrophotometer. The spectrum of the buffer alone was also determined and was subtracted from the enzyme spectrum. The identification of the flavin as flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) was performed as described (14Bessey O.A. Lowry O.H. Love R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 180: 755-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PCLase (240 μg in 100 μl) was denatured by addition of an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid and incubation for 15 min on ice. The sample was then centrifuged, and the supernatant divided into two equal portions, with one-half neutralized immediately by addition of 25 μl of 4m K2HPO4, followed by determination of its fluorescence (λex = 450 nm; λem = 535 nm). The remaining half was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in the dark, neutralized as above, and its fluorescence was determined. The ratio of FAD to protein was determined using the molar extinction coefficient at 454 nm of 12.5 mm−1cm−1 (15Hoober K.L. Honeja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Analysis of the inhibition of PCLase by DPI was performed by adding increasing concentrations of DPI (see Fig. 3 C) to PCLase (200 nm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 5 μm [35S]FC. Reactions were conducted for 15 min at 37 °C, and product formation was determined by thin-layer chromatography as described above. PCLase activity was routinely determined by following the conversion of [35S]FC (∼50,000 cpm/time point) to [35S]cysteine by thin-layer chromatography as described (10Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the studies comparing cysteine and hydrogen peroxide production, a fluorimetric assay of cysteine production was also employed. This assay involved reacting the cysteine formed during the reaction with the fluorogenic compound 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin to yield a fluorescent product. PCLase (300 nm) was mixed with saturating FC (100 μm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. At time intervals ranging to 30 min, 50-μl samples were removed and mixed with 50 μl of 0.2 mm 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin in the assay buffer. A control reaction without FC was processed in parallel. The intensity of fluorescence was determined (λex = 384 nm; λem = 470 nm) in a 100-μl cuvette, and cysteine formed was calculated from a cysteine standard curve. Hydrogen peroxide produced in the PCLase reaction was measured using the Amplex Red kit (Molecular Probes). PCLase (10 ng/μl) was incubated at 23 °C in the buffer provided, which also contained horseradish peroxidase and Amplex Red. After the base line was established, the PCLase substrate FC was added to a final concentration of 5 μm. The action of horseradish peroxidase on Amplex Red in the presence of hydrogen peroxide converts the Amplex Red into a fluorogenic product (16Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Fluorescence analysis of the reaction mixture was conducted (λex = 563 nm, λem = 587 nm). In the previous study, the PCLase action on FC was shown to produce free cysteine and an unidentified hydrophobic moiety derived from the isoprenoid constituent (10Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because in that study the isoprenoid product appeared to be less polar than farnesol (10Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this product might be the isoprenoid aldehyde,i.e. farnesal. To test this possibility, FC that had 14C incorporated in the isoprenoid moiety was incubated with purified bovine PCLase. Analysis of the reaction mixture by reverse-phase HPLC revealed the expected loss of radioactivity in the substrate FC because of digestion by PCLase, as well as the appearance of a peak of radioactivity that comigrated with an authentic farnesal standard (Fig. 1, A andB). When the reaction mixture was subjected to derivatization with semicarbazide, a compound that forms an imine adduct with aldehydes (17March, J. (1985) Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, 4th Ed., pp. 884 and 905, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar), the radiolabeled product of the reaction now comigrated with the authentic farnesal-semicarbazone standard (Fig.1 C). Similar results were seen when reaction mixtures were analyzed using a normal-phase thin-layer chromatography system (data not shown). These data revealed that the isoprenoid product of the PCLase reaction was the aldehyde of the isoprenoid and indicated an oxidative type of mechanism for the enzyme. The finding that PCLase produced an oxidized isoprenoid suggested that the enzyme utilized molecular oxygen as a cosubstrate. To examine this possibility, the PCLase reaction was studied in the absence and presence of oxygen. Solutions of the enzyme and assay components were made anaerobic by degassing with argon, placed in a sealed chamber, and aliquots were removed for analysis of product formation. Essentially no product formation was detected under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2). However, when the reaction chamber was opened to the atmosphere to allow oxygen entry, product formation ensued in a linear fashion with a rate constant of 0.25 min−1 (Fig. 2). These results indicated that PCLase requires molecular oxygen for product formation and are consistent with a reaction proceeding via an oxidative mechanism that forms a prenyl aldehyde. Many enzymes that use oxygen also utilize a flavin and/or NAD(P)H as cofactors (18Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. Freeman, San Francisco1979: 358-429Google Scholar). However, PCLase shows no NAD(P)H requirement for catalysis (10Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility for other cofactors, the visible spectrum of recombinant PCLase was measured. This spectroscopic analysis revealed the presence of characteristic peaks of a flavoenzyme at 360 and 454 nm (Fig. 3 A) (18Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. Freeman, San Francisco1979: 358-429Google Scholar). To determine whether the apparent flavin cofactor was flavin mononucleotide (FMN) or FAD, we took advantage of the facts that FAD has a much lower intrinsic fluorescence than FMN because of the π-π stacking of the isoalloxazine ring system with the adenine ring of FAD and that FAD can be converted to FMN by acid hydrolysis of the diphosphate bond, thereby releasing this π-π interaction (14Bessey O.A. Lowry O.H. Love R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 180: 755-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, PCLase was subjected to acid denaturation, and the denatured enzyme was pelleted. The resultant supernatant was divided with one-half being immediately neutralized and the other half incubated in the acid for 3 h at 37 °C prior to neutralization. Analysis of the fractions by fluorescence spectroscopy revealed an emission signature consistent with the presence of a flavin (Fig.3 B). This fluorescence markedly increased in the sample subjected to acid hydrolysis (Fig. 3 B), indicating the identity of the flavin as being FAD. Furthermore, this experiment indicated that the FAD cofactor was not covalently attached to the enzyme, because it was released upon denaturation. In addition, the absorption intensity at 454 nm corresponded to a ratio of FAD to protein of 1.3:1 (data not shown; see “Experimental Procedures”), indicating that the enzyme contained a stoichiometric amount of FAD. To demonstrate that the bound FAD was required for catalysis, PCLase was treated with DPI, a compound that blocks the reoxidation of FAD to the reduced state (19Coves J. Lebrun C. Gervasi G. Dalbon P. Fontecave M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). DPI treatment inhibited the PCLase reaction in a dose-dependent fashion with an IC50 of ∼100 μm (Fig. 3 C). These results provided compelling evidence that FAD participates in a catalytic manner in the enzyme by cycling between its oxidized and reduced forms, a result again completely consistent with an unusual oxidative mechanism for the enzyme. Many flavoenzymes generate hydrogen peroxide during catalysis by reduction of oxygen (18Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. Freeman, San Francisco1979: 358-429Google Scholar). To determine whether PCLase produced hydrogen peroxide, a peroxidase-linked assay was used that employed a nonfluorogenic substrate (Amplex Red) that is converted to a fluorogenic compound by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (16Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Addition of the substrate FC to a mixture of PCLase in the presence of HRP and Amplex Red resulted in a biphasic time course of hydrogen peroxide formation (Fig. 4), the first phase apparently being due to equilibration of the reaction, with the second phase representing the steady state rate of hydrogen peroxide production. The rate of the linear increase in hydrogen peroxide formation in the second phase (kobs = 0.27 ± 0.02 min−1) correlated well with the rate of cysteine formation determined for aliquots of the same reaction mixture (kobs = 0.18 ± 0.02 min−1, indicating stoichiometric production of hydrogen peroxide during turnover by the enzyme. Based on the data reported in this and the previous study (10Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we propose the mechanism for the PCLase reaction shown in Fig.5. Although the mechanism depicted is not the only one that could be drawn for PCLase, we believe that it is the most likely mechanism, because it is the simplest one that can be envisioned that accounts for all three products of this reaction,i.e. free cysteine, the prenyl aldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide. In this mechanism, the reaction is initiated by FAD-mediated hydride abstraction from C-1 of the isoprenoid moiety, producing a reduced flavin and an allylic (i.e. resonance-stabilized) carbocation intermediate. Attack of a water molecule on the carbocation results in formation of a hemithioacetal, which then collapses to the prenyl aldehyde concomitant with C-S bond breakage in which cysteine acts as the leaving group. Meanwhile the hydride of the reduced flavin is transferred to molecular oxygen, resulting in hydrogen peroxide formation and reoxidation of the flavin. In summary, this study provides evidence for a novel mechanism in the catabolism of prenylcysteines by PCLase. These findings are particularly intriguing in light of the fact that PCLase has essentially no homology to other known proteins (11Tschantz W.R. Zhang L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35802-35808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The uniqueness of PCLase may be a result of uniqueness of its substrates; thioethers are rare in mammalian organisms, and prenylcysteines are the only known thioethers that contain an allylic carbon in the C-S bond. Characterization of structure-function relationships of PCLase are likely to yield important findings as to how it achieves this type of catalysis. These and other ongoing studies should provide insight into this unusual enzyme that will allow a better understanding of the cellular role of PCLase in the metabolism of prenylcysteines.

https://openalex.org/W2032844137,"The kinetics of nucleotide turnover vary considerably among isoforms of vertebrate type II myosin, possibly due to differences in the rate of ADP release from the nucleotide binding pocket. Current ideas about likely mechanisms by which ADP release is regulated have focused on the hyperflexible surface loops of myosin, i.e. loop 1 (ATPase loop) and loop 2 (actin binding loop). In the present study, we investigated the kinetic properties of rat and pig beta-myosin heavy chains (beta-MHC) in which we have found the sequences of loop 1 (residues 204-216) to be virtually identical, i.e. DQSKKDSQTPKG, with a single conservative substitution (rat E210D pig). Pig myocardium normally expresses 100% beta-MHC, whereas rat myocardium was induced to express 100% beta-MHC by surgical thyroidectomy and subsequent treatment with propylthiouracil. Slack test measurements at 15 degrees C yielded unloaded shortening velocities of 1.1 +/- 0.8 muscle lengths/s in rat skinned ventricular myocytes and 0.35 +/- 0.05 muscle lengths/s in pig skinned myocytes. Similarly, solution measurements at the same temperature showed that actin-activated ATPase activity was 2.9-fold greater for rat beta-myosin than for pig beta-myosin. Stopped-flow methods were then used to assess the rates of acto-myosin dissociation by MgATP both in the presence and absence of MgADP. Although the rates of MgATP-induced dissociation of acto-heavy meromyosin (acto-HMM) were virtually identical for the two myosins, the rate of ADP dissociation was approximately 3.8-fold faster for rat beta-myosin (135 s(-)(1)) than for pig beta-myosin (35 s(-)(1)). ATP cleavage rates were nearly 30% faster for rat beta-myosin. Thus, whereas loop 1 appears from other studies to be involved in nucleotide turnover in the pocket, our results show that loop 1 does not account for large differences in turnover kinetics in these two myosin isoforms. Instead, the differences appear to be due to sequence differences in other parts of the MHC backbone."

Here we investigated the desensitization, internalization, and phosphorylation of sst1 expressed in CHO-K1 cells. Treatment of cells with 100 nm SRIF for 30 min reduced maximal SRIF inhibition of adenylyl cyclase from 40 to 10%. This desensitization was rapid (t(12) 180 min). Incubation of cells with SRIF also caused a rapid (t(12) < 2 min) increase in sst1 receptor phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (EC(50) = 1.3 nm), as determined in a mobility shift phosphorylation assay. Receptor phosphorylation was not affected by pertussis toxin, indicating a requirement for receptor occupancy rather than signaling. The protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also stimulated sst1 receptor phosphorylation whereas forskolin did not. Both agonist- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated receptor phosphorylation occurred mainly on serine. These studies are the first to demonstrate phosphorylation of the sst1 receptor and suggest that phosphorylation mediated uncoupling, rather than sequestration, leads to its desensitization."

The data suggested that rodent HSL mRNA and protein are expressed in haploid germ cells with a lag between mRNA and protein appearance. However, the precise germ cell type(s) expressing HSL was not determined in rat and it was not possible to rule out HSL expression in Sertoli cells. Moreover, the expression of HSL in germ cells of other mammalian species, including man, has not been documented. The effects of HSL gene disruption in mice have recently been reported (7Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of the phenotype is male sterility due to oligospermia. Degenerated spermatocytes and spermatids were observed in HSL-deficient testis with a lack of mature spermatozoa. The data clearly demonstrate that HSL is required for spermatogenesis. The human adipose tissue form of HSL is encoded by 9 exons spanning 11 kb (8Langin D. Laurell H. Stenson Holst L. Belfrage P. Holm C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The transcription start site was mapped in a short 5′-noncoding exon located 1.5 kb upstream of the first coding exon (9Grober J. Laurell H. Blaise R. Fabry B. Schaak S. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 2.8-kb mRNA encodes a 775-amino acid protein. A specific form of HSL, named HSLtes, is expressed in human and rat testis (5Stenson Holst L. Langin D. Mulder H. Laurell H. Grober J. Bergh A. Mohrenweiser H.W. Edgren G. Holm C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The 3.9-kb human HSLtes mRNA encodes a 1076-amino acid protein. HSLtes contains a unique NH2-terminal domain in addition to the 775 amino acids common to adipocyte and testis HSL. This additional domain is encoded by a testis-specific exon located 15 kb upstream of the first of the 9 exons encoding adipocyte HSL. The genomic organization suggested, as is often seen when a gene is expressed in somatic tissues and in germ cells, the use of different promoters to govern tissue-specific expression. We recently investigated the molecular mechanisms that control the testis-specific expression of HSLtes (10Blaise R. Grober J. Rouet P. Tavernier G. Daegelen D. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9327-9334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were generated with 1.4 and 0.5 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the human HSLtes-specific exon linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. High levels of CAT activity were measured in testis from different lines of sexually mature transgenic mice. No reporter gene activity was observed in nongonadal tissues in males and in all tissues studied in the females. Therefore, the sequences present in the first 0.5 kb of the human HSLtes promoter confer germ cell-specific expression. To characterize nuclear protein-DNA interactions in the HSLtes promoter, a series of gel retardation assays was performed with oligonucleotides spanning the 0.5-kb region. Four regions bound nuclear proteins expressed in testis but not in liver, an organ that does not express HSL. The most proximal region contained a sequence AACAAAG that bound recombinant Sox proteins. Sox proteins contain a high mobility group DNA-binding domain and are related to the testis-determining factor SRY (11Pevny L.H. Lovell-Badge R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined the germ cell types expressing HSL mRNA and protein and further delimited the region conferring testis specificity in the human HSLtes promoter. Immunohistochemistry experiments performed on rat, mouse, and human testis showed that, in the three species, HSL-like immunoreactivity exhibits a biphasic pattern with a first wave of expression in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes and, a second wave of expression in elongating and elongated spermatids. The highest expression levels were observed in the latter cells. Northern blot analyses showed that HSLtes mRNA is abundant in early spermatids and in the cytoplasmic fragments of late spermatids and residual bodies. Studies performed on the human HSLtespromoter showed that, although a Sox-like protein present in nuclear extracts from pachytene spermatocytes binds to the promoter, mutation of the corresponding AACAAAG sequence does not abolish testis-specific CAT expression in transgenic mice. Additional transgenic analyses established that 95 bp upstream of the transcription start site were sufficient for testis-specific expression of the CAT reporter gene. Using early spermatid nuclear extracts and transgenesis, a GT-rich binding region was identified in the 95-bp sequence and shown to be involved in the testis-specific expression of HSL. Mice (8, 16, 24, and 48 days old) and rats (9, 20, 35, 45, and 90 days old) were purchased from Elevage Janvier (Le Genest Saint Isle, France). Human testes were obtained from patients undergoing therapeutic orchidectomy for metastatic prostate carcinoma (protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of the city of Rennes, France). Testes were stored in Bouin's solution for 24 h (mouse), 72 h (rat), and 48 h (human). The fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin wax. Sections (5 μm thick) were dried overnight at 37 °C, deparaffined, and rehydrated through decreasing grades of alcohol. Sections were microwaved three times (5 min each) in 0.01 m sodium citrate (pH 6) buffer. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 3% H2O2 for 5 min. Sections were incubated with affinity-purified polyclonal anti-rat HSL antibodies (rat and mouse sections) and afffinity-purified polyclonal anti-human HSL antibodies (human sections) at 0.5 and 2 μg/ml, respectively. Complexes were revealed using biotinylated antibodies (Dako) at a working dilution of 1:500 coupled with streptavidin-peroxidase amplification. Preimmune sera were used as negative controls. Sections were counterstained with 0.2% hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted in Eukitt (Polylabo, Strasbourg, France) for microscopic observation. Leydig, Sertoli, and peritubular cells and, spermatogonia were isolated as described (12Dejucq N. Dugast I. Ruffault A. van der Meide P.H. Jégou B. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4925-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For germ cell elutriation, testes of 8 adult rats were decapsulated in PBS buffer and tubules were dissociated mechanically using scalpels. Tubules were washed twice in PBS buffer and digested with 0.025% trypsin for 30 min at 30 °C. Digestion was stopped by addition of 3.2 mg of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Tubules were filtered through a 100-μm filter, then through glass wool and centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS+ buffer (PBS buffer with 800 μm CaCl2 and 500 μmMgCl2) and then centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in PBS+c buffer (PBS+ buffer with 5 g/liter bovine serum albumin and 300 mg/liter glucose). The solution was filtered through a 20-μm nylon filter. Pachytene spermatocytes, early spermatids, and fragments of late spermatids plus residual bodies that are shed by late spermatids at the time of spermiation were purified by centrifugal elutriation with respective purity of 90, 90, and 75–85% (13Pineau C.

Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (10Blaise R. Grober J. Rouet P. Tavernier G. Daegelen D. Langin D. J. Biol.

Using the same method, the −49/−31 bp region in −209HSLtesCAT was mutated into 5′-GAATTCTGTTCTGTG-3′ (−209mutHSLtesCAT). All PCR constructs were sequenced on ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyser (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fragments were microinjected into mouse oocytes and transgenic mice were produced as described (10Blaise R. Grober J. Rouet P. Tavernier G. Daegelen D. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9327-9334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Screening of the positive transgenic animals was performed with DNA prepared from tails by Southern blot and PCR using as sense primer, an oligonucleotide located in the human HSLtes promoter and as antisense primer, an oligonucleotide located in the CAT gene (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strühl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). Copy number was determined by Southern blot analysis. Protein extracts for CAT assays were prepared from the following tissues of hemizygous transgenic mice: testis, epididymis, kidney, spleen, liver, small intestine, heart, lung, brain, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Briefly, tissues were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 0.5 ml of 250 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Homogenates were heated 7.5 min at 65 °C and centrifuged at 4 °C 15 min at 18,000 × g. Supernatants were kept for CAT and protein analyses (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strühl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). To precisely determine the localization of HSL in testis, we performed light immunohistochemistry on adult mouse, rat, and human testes. Serial adjacent testis sections were labeled with antibodies directed against rat or human HSL. Fig. 1 shows representative sections and a schematic summary of HSL expression in germ cells during the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. In mouse and human, HSL-like immunoreactivity was first observed in the cytoplasms of B spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes. In rat, primary spermatocytes were labeled. In the three species, a second wave of expression was observed in the elongating and elongated spermatids. The staining was intense in the latest steps of spermiogenesis. After spermiation, strong labeling was found in residual bodies in the mouse and rat and residual staining was visible in spermatozoa. Residual bodies are difficult to observe in human testis sections (16Breucker H. Schäfer E. Holstein A. Cell Tissue Res. 1985; 240: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In human testis, weak labeling was also observed in Sertoli cells. The staining of Sertoli cells was clearly visible in tubules devoid of germ cells. To investigate the ontogeny of HSL, immunohistochemistry experiments were also performed in testis from mice (8-, 16-, 24- and 48-day-old) and rats (9-, 20-, 35-, 45-, and 90-day-old) at different ages (data not shown). In rodents, the first wave of spermatogenesis in prepubertal animals is synchronized and the appearance of novel germ cell type can be associated with protein expression. In the rat, HSL-like immunoreactivity appeared at day 20 with weak labeling in pachytene spermatocytes. At day 35, a strong labeling was observed in elongated spermatids. The results at day 45 were similar to the data in 90-day-old animals (Fig. 1). In the mouse, the appearance of pachytene spermatocytes was associated with a strong labeling at day 16. At day 24, the first early spermatids were not labeled. In 48-day-old animals, high HSL-like immunoreactivity was observed in elongated spermatids. Northern blot analyses using total RNA prepared from elutriated rat germ cells showed that the 3.9-kb HSLtes mRNA is strongly expressed in early spermatids (Fig.2). No band was visible in other cell types. An abundant expression was also observed in late spermatid cytoplasmic fragments and residual bodies where β-actin mRNA was not detected. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay showed that HSL transcripts were weakly expressed in pachytene spermatocytes (data not shown).Figure 2HSLtes mRNA expression in rat testicular cell types. RNA blots were prepared with 20 μg of total RNA from peritubular cells (PT), spermatogonia (G), Sertoli cells (S), Leydig cells (L), pachytene spermatocytes (PS), early spermatids (ES), and late spermatid cytoplasmic fragments plus residual bodies (RB). The blot was hybridized with rat HSL and β-actin cDNA probes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We recently showed that 0.5 kb of the human HSLtes promoter conferred testis-specific expression in transgenic mice (10Blaise R.

In this region, we characterized an AACAAAG site for Sox proteins that bound a protein expressed in testis but not in liver. Using purified germ cell nuclear extracts, we observed using gel retardation assays that the testis-specific protein binding to the −250/−216 oligonucleotide containing the AACAAAG sequence (10Blaise R.

Efficient competition of the band was observed with an oligonucleotide containing an AACAAT sequence that has been shown to bind members of the Sry/Sox family (17Denny P. Swift S. Connor F.

We showed previously that mutation of the AACAAAG sequence abolished Sox protein binding (10Blaise R. Grober J. Rouet P. Tavernier G. Daegelen D. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9327-9334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine whether the binding site was critical for testis-specific expression of HSL, a CAT construct containing the 0.5-kb 5′-flanking region with a mutation of the AACAAAG sequence was microinjected into mouse oocytes (Fig.4). Eight independent transgenic lines were obtained (Table I). In 5 out of 8 transgenic lines, high levels of CAT activity were measured in testis from adult mice. Nongonadal tissues showed very low levels of CAT activity (<10 cpm/min/mg of protein). The testis of mice from 3 transgenic lines exhibited background levels of CAT activity, presumably due to the insertion of the transgene at a chromosomal location that suppresses expression.Table ICAT activity of −515mutSoxHSLtesCAT in transgenic mouse testisLineCopy no.CAT activity221–2<10383–4<10451–2<103712090591–2873651–2660722–3270805840Data represent the number of transgene copies (copy no.) in different transgenic lines and means of CAT activity expressed as cpm/min/mg of protein determined on testes from three to six 60-day-old mice per transgenic line.

In the first 0.5 kb of the HSLtespromoter, four regions bound nuclear proteins expressed in testis but not in liver. To determine whether these regions played a role in the testis specific activity of the promoter, CAT constructs with progressive deletions of the 5′-flanking region were used to generate transgenic mice (Fig. 4). Deletion of the first 3 testis-specific binding regions did not abolish CAT activity in transgenic testis (Table II). In agreement with the data obtained with the fragment containing the mutated Sox-binding site, high level of CAT activity was found in testis from transgenic mice produced with a 209-bp 5′-flanking region that does not contain the AACAAAG sequence. Mice harboring a transgenic construct containing 95 bp upstream of the transcription start site still showed strong testicular CAT activity. In all the lines, CAT activity associated to transgene expression in spermatozoa was detected in epididymis. None of the transgenic lines showed CAT activity above background levels in nongonadal tissues (<10 cpm/min/mg of protein). The different lines were tested for testis expression of the transgenes at day 21 which in prepubertal mice corresponds to the accumulation of pachytene spermatocytes and the appearance of the first early spermatids in the seminiferous tubules. In agreement with an activity of the human HSLtes promoter in haploid germ cells, background levels of CAT activity were measured (data not shown).Table IICAT activity of human HSLtes promoter-CAT gene constructs in transgenic mouse testisConstructLineCopy no.CAT activity−515HSLtesCAT131666−460HSLtesCAT222–3<10322–323536501890−316HSLtesCAT51–24021841264−209HSLtesCAT1350900161–21571710223331190−95HSLtesCAT2422703442737391020534088654341167Data represent the number of transgene copies (copy no.) in different transgenic lines and means of CAT activity expressed as cpm/min/mg of protein determined on testes from three to six 60-day-old mice per transgenic line.

The 95-bp region did not contain known consensus sequences for transcription factors expressed in testis. To characterize DNA binding of nuclear proteins expressed in cells with active HSLtes gene transcription, nuclear extracts were prepared from a purified preparation of early spermatids and used in gel retardation assays with 3 overlapping 50-bp oligonucleotides covering the entire 95-bp region (Fig.5). The −96/−47 probe revealed weak binding with spermatid nuclear extracts. The −61/−12 and −28/+22 probes bound several proteins present in liver and spermatid nuclear extracts. When ZnCl2 was added in the binding buffer, a retarded band was observed with the −61/−12 probe using nuclear extracts prepared from early spermatids but not from liver (Figs. 5 and6). Competition experiments showed that the binding site was located between −46 and −29 bp from the transcription start site. An oligonucleotide with a mutation of the −49/−36 bp region did not compete the testis-specific binding observed with the −61/−12 probe (Fig. 6) and did not bind testis-specific nuclear proteins (data not shown). To determine thein vivo importance of this region, we generated eight independent transgenic lines with a −209HSLtesCAT construct bearing the mutation of the −49/−31 bp region (−209mutHSLtesCAT). In all the transgenic lines, very low CAT activities were observed in testis (Table III) and in nongonadal tissues (data not shown) of transgenic adult mice. These results showed that mutation of the −49/−31-bp region abolished testis-specific promoter activity. The whole data suggest that the binding of a testis-specific zinc finger transcription factor"

The interaction of the bound lectin immobilized on the sensor chip with a selected group of high mannose oligosaccharides was monitored in real time with the change in response units. This investigation corroborates our earlier study about the special preference of garlic lectin for terminal α-1,2-linked mannose residues. An increase in binding propensity can be directly correlated to the addition of α-1,2-linked mannose to the mannooligosaccharide at its nonreducing end. Mannononase glycopeptide (Man9GlcNAc2Asn), the highest oligomer studied, exhibited the greatest binding affinity (K a = 1.2 × 106m−1 at 25 °C). An analysis of these data reveals that the α-1,2-linked terminal mannose on the α-1,6 arm is the critical determinant in the recognition of mannooligosaccharides by the lectin. The association (k 1) and dissociation rate constants (k −1) for the binding of Man9GlcNAc2Asn to Allium sativumagglutinin I are 6.1 × 104m−1 s−1and 4.9 × 10−2s−1, respectively, at 25 °C. Whereask 1 increases progressively from Man3 to Man7 derivatives, and more dramatically so for Man8 and Man9 derivatives,k −1 decreases relatively much less gradually from Man3 to Man9 structures. An unprecedented increase in the association rate constant for interaction with Allium sativum agglutinin I with the structure of the oligosaccharide ligand constitutes a significant finding in protein-sugar recognition.

Allium sativum agglutinin surface plasmon resonance response unit isothermal titration calorimetric The structurally and evolutionarily related monocot mannose-binding proteins comprise a superfamily of mannose-specific lectins. Amaryllidaceae, Alliaceae, Araceae, Orchidaceae, Iridaceae, and Liliaceae families have been shown to possess these bulb lectins (1Barre A. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. Rouge P. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Among the unique features that set them apart from the Glc/Man/Gal-specific family of dicotyledonous legume lectins and the C-type mannose-binding animal lectins is their high degree of stereospecificity for mannose, so much so that they show no binding propensity even for its epimer, glucose, or the conformationally related analog, l-fucose. Their classification into the mannose-specific lectin family is corroborated by determination of the crystal structures of snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) (2Hester G. Kaku H. Goldstein I.J. Wright C.S.

Their subunits have been observed to possess a novel 3-fold symmetry having three four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets arranged as three sides of a triangular prism, forming a 12-stranded β-barrel referred to as the β-prism II fold. These 12 strands are positioned perpendicular to the plane of symmetry, unlike the other known all-β-folds: β-prism I (e.g.Jacalin; (7Shankarnarayanan R. Sekar K. Banerjee R. Sharma V. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)) and the β-trefoil (e.g. amaranthin; (8Murzin A.G. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 285: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The central region in the β-barrel is stacked with conserved hydrophobic side chains, which stabilize the subunit. Bulbs of garlic are known to accumulate two types of mannose-binding lectins: the heterodimeric A. sativum agglutinin I (ASAI)1 and the homodimeric ASAII (9Van Damme E.J.M. Smeets K. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Goldstein I.J. Peumans W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interaction of ASAI and ASAII with mannooligosaccharides and glycoproteins has been investigated extensively by an enzyme-linked lectin adsorbent assay (10Dam T.K. Bachhawat K. Rani P.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5528-5535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both of these lectins exhibit identical sugar specificities, although subtle differences between them cannot be ruled out in view of the qualitative nature of enzyme-linked lectin adsorbent assay. Enzyme-linked lectin adsorbent assay implicated α-1,2-linked mannose at the nonreducing end to determine the affinity for the higher order structures of mannose, evidenced by a sequential increase in potency with an increase in the number of α-1,2-linked mannose residues (10Dam T.K. Bachhawat K. Rani P.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5528-5535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In enzyme-linked lectin adsorbent assay, the recognition and adsorption properties of lectins with the specific sugar residues of glycoproteins are used for the assay purpose; therefore the method fails to provide information on the affinities of interaction or the elementary steps involved therein. On the other hand, kinetic studies using stopped flow and fluorescence titrations of the interaction of lectins with its ligands require large amounts of both the lectin and the saccharides as well as the labeling of the latter with a fluorophore or a chromophore. Therefore, in this study, the more sensitive, label-free, and fast response surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method took precedence as a means to delineate the affinities and the kinetic parameters for the interaction of ASAI with its complementary mannooligosaccharide ligands (11Thomas C.J.

Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) used SPR to determine the carbohydrate specificity of a few monocot mannose-binding lectins. More recently, Van Damme et al. (14Van Damme E.J.M. Astoul C.H. Barre A. Rouge P. Peumans W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5067-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) characterized the carbohydrate binding propensity for Crocus vernus agglutinin using a biosensor. Both these investigations were carried out with large molecular weight glycoproteins, which are easier to monitor but fail to reveal the subtle features of carbohydrate moieties involved in these recognitions. In contrast, the study reported here with the individual purified mannooligosaccharide helps to unravel, in detail, the specificity invoked by garlic lectin for the recognition of its complementary ligands. All the chemicals used, namely the components for phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.4), as well asN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydrosuccinamide, were of the highest purity available. Certified grade CM5 sensor chips were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Mannose, methyl-α-mannose, Man3GlcNAc2, Man5GlcNAc2, Man6GlcNAc2, Man7GlcNAc2 (I and II), and Man8GlcNAc2 were obtained from Sigma. Man3 and Man5 were procured from Dextra Laboratories. Man9GlcNAc2Asn was prepared in the laboratory from the Pronase digestion of soybean agglutinin (15Lis H. Sharon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3468-3476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Mandal D.K. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2602-2609Google Scholar). Man5GlcNAc2Asn was obtained as a byproduct of the above preparation (15Lis H. Sharon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3468-3476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Man6GlcNAc2Asn and Man5GlcNAc (Isosep, Tullinge, Sweden) were kind gifts from Prof. C. F. Brewer, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York and Prof. C. G. Gahmberg, Department of Biochemistry, University of Helsinki, Finland, respectively. ASAI was isolated and purified to homogeneity as described previously (10Dam T.K. Bachhawat K. Rani P.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5528-5535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The protein samples were prepared as required by the nature of the experiments described below. Concentrations of all the saccharides were determined by measuring their neutral sugar content by the phenol-sulfuric acid method (17Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40882) Google Scholar). Mannose was used as the standard. Biospecific interaction analysis was performed using a BIAcore 2000™ (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden) biosensor system based on the principle of SPR. Nearly 1500 response units (RUs) of ASAI (0.1 mg/ml in 5 mm NaAc (pH 4.5)) were coupled to a certified grade CM5 chip at a flow rate of 1 μl/min for 50 min using the amine coupling kit (N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, N-hydrosuccinamide) supplied by the manufacturer. Here, coupling of an RU corresponds to ∼1 pg/mm2 of immobilized protein. The unreacted species on the surface of the chip was blocked with ethanolamine. All measurements were done using 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Prior to injection, protein samples were dialyzed extensively against the same buffer to avoid buffer mismatch. For the determination of association rate constants, the solution of the ligands was passed over the chip (1–80 μm) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The dissociation rate constants were determined by passing buffer subsequently at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The surface was regenerated by a 10-s pulse of 500 mm MeαMan flowing at 50 μl/min. Association (k 1) and dissociation (k -1) rate constants were obtained by nonlinear fitting of the primary sensorgram data using the BIA evaluation software version 3.0. The dissociation rate constant is derived using the equation, Rt=Rt0e−k−1(t−t0)Equation 1 where R t is the response at time tand R t0 is the amplitude of the initial response. The association rate constantk 1 can be derived using Equation 2, from the measured k −1 values, Rt=Rmax[1−e−(k1C+k−1)(t−t0)]Equation 2 where R max is the maximum response andC is the concentration of the analyte (ligand) in the solution. K a(k 1/k −1) is the association constant. The parameters obtained from the binding interaction of the ligands with the protein on the surface of the chip were also plotted as per Scatchard analysis (18Rao J. Lin Y. Bing X. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2629-2630Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17806) Google Scholar, 20Patil A.R. Thomas C.J.

Isothermal titration microcalorimetry was performed using an OMEGA microcalorimeter from Microcal Inc. (Northampton, MA). In individual titrations, injections of 5–6 μl of carbohydrate solution were made by a computer-controlled 250-μl syringe at an interval of 3 min into the lectin solution dissolved in the same buffer as the saccharide, while stirring at 396 rpm. Control experiments were performed by identical injections of saccharide into the cell containing only the buffer. The experimental data were fitted to a theoretical titration curve using the software provided by Microcal. All experiments performed were within c values of 1 < c < 200, wherec = K a × M t(0),M t(0) is the initial macromolecule concentration, and K a is the binding constant (21Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the basic equations of thermodynamics, ΔG=ΔH−TΔS=−RT lnKaEquation 3 where ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of binding, respectively, T is the absolute temperature, andR = 1.98 cal mol−1K−1. Documented in Fig. 1 and TableI are the various mannose-containing carbohydrate ligands that were tested for their binding propensity to ASAI. The selection of the sugars was based on our previous study, wherein higher oligomers of mannose were implicated in binding to ASAI. Binding of saccharides shorter than mannotriose could not be analyzed, because no appreciable change in RUs was observed upon their flow over the immobilized ASAI on the sensor chip, consistent with the sensitivity and specifications of the instrument. The use of a certified grade sensor chip in this study allowed satisfactory recording of RU changes corresponding to oligosaccharides having molecular masses greater than 400 Da. RU changes observed with the mannobioses (molecular mass 360 Da) provided sensorgrams that were not consistently reproducible.Table IBinding kinetics of ASAI-mannooligosaccharide interaction at 298 ± 0.1 KOligosaccharidek1k−1Ka(k1/k−1)KaSc.KbITCm−1s−1s−1m−1m−1m−1(1) Man3 1-aΔH bITC = −20.2 kJ mol−1, ΔG bITC = −11.5 kJ mol−1, ΔS bITC = −29.2 J K−1mol−1.77.30.61126.7120.2144(2) Man3GlcNAc274.10.59125.6119.8(3) Man5 1-bΔH bITC = −24.2 kJ mol−1, ΔG bITC = −12.6 kJ mol−1, ΔS bITC = −35.2 J K−1mol−1.98.30.58169.5163.4162(4) Man5GlcNAc102.20.55185.8181.5(5) Man5GlcNAc297.40.58167.9165.8(6) Man5GlcNAc2Asn105.20.47223.8218.2(7) Man6GlcNAc2No binding(7′) Man6GlcNAc2Asn(8) Man7GlcNAc2(I)50510.0608.4 e 48.5 e 4(9) Man7GlcNAc2(II)No binding(10) Man8GlcNAc21.0 e 40.0561.8 e 51.8 e 5(11) Man9GlcNAc2Asn1-cΔH bITC = −42.9 kJ mol−1, ΔG bITC = −26.7 kJ mol−1, ΔS bITC = −54.4 J K−1mol−1.6.1 e 40.0491.2 e 61.1 e 69.1 e 51-a ΔH bITC = −20.2 kJ mol−1, ΔG bITC = −11.5 kJ mol−1, ΔS bITC = −29.2 J K−1mol−1.1-b ΔH bITC = −24.2 kJ mol−1, ΔG bITC = −12.6 kJ mol−1, ΔS bITC = −35.2 J K−1mol−1.1-c ΔH bITC = −42.9 kJ mol−1, ΔG bITC = −26.7 kJ mol−1, ΔS bITC = −54.4 J K−1mol−1. Open table in a new tab A representative sensorgram for the interaction of varying amounts (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 μm) of trimannoside (Manα1–3(Manα1–6)Man) (1) passed over ASAI immobilized on a certified grade CM5 chip is shown in Fig.2 A. The curves, fitted by mass transport limited analyses at 25 °C, yield values fork 1 and k -1 of 77.3m−1 s−1and 0.61 s−1, respectively. An equal distribution of residuals for both phases of the reaction support the monoexponential nature of interaction (data not shown). The ratiok 1/k −1provides an estimate of K a of 127m−1 at 25 °C (Table I). These parameters evaluated from SPR data are in good agreement with those obtained from isothermal titration calorimetric (ITC) measurements (Fig. 3). The binding constant obtained for the binding of (1) to ASAI at 25 °C is 144m−1, and the ΔH°ITC and ΔG°ITCare −20.2 and −11.5 kJ mol−1, respectively. In addition, Scatchard analysis of the SPR data yieldedK a, which is in accordance with the ratiok 1/k -1 as well as the values of K bITC (Fig. 2 A,inset) (22Puri K.D. Khan M.I. Gupta D. Surolia A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8909-8918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An agreement between the SPR and ITC data substantiate the monophasic nature of the binding interaction. ITC experiments with the other mannooligosaccharides were not done due to paucity of the saccharides.Figure 3a, an isothermal calorimetric titration of 5.2-μl aliquots of 112.5 mm trimannoside into 7.5 mm ASAI at 25 °C. b, the integrated curve shows experimental points (solid squares) and the best fit (solid line) of the curve.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Among the mannooligosaccharides both (1) and mannopentaose (3), as well as their reducing end sugar derivatives,i.e. Man3GlcNAc2 (2), Man5GlcNAc (4), Man5GlcNAc2 (5), and Man5GlcNAc2Asn (6), show very slow association and fast dissociation rate constants (Table I). Extension of (3) with two α-1,2-linked mannosyl residues at its nonreducing end increases k 1 in a profound manner. Further extensions as in Man8GlcNAc2(10) and Man9GlcNAc2Asn (11) do so even more dramatically (Fig. 2 B). Although k-1 also decreases progressively for the extended structures as compared with Man3 and Man5, these changes are relatively less pronounced compared with the effects on the association rate constants (Table I). The binding kinetics for ASAI with the set of selected mannooligosaccharides (Fig. 1) is seen to follow a single-step mechanism. The k 1 values observed here are in the range of 0.077 × 103m−1 s−1(for (1)) to 6.1 × 104m−1 s−1(for (11)). These second order rate constants are significantly lower than diffusion-controlled reactions (22Puri K.D. Khan M.I. Gupta D. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16378-16387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sastry M.V.K. Swamy M.J. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14826-14831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding for such reactions is thought to involve an intermediatePL i, which subsequently isomerizes to the final complex PL*. P+Lk1⇐⇒k−1PLik2⇐⇒k−2PL* Reaction−1In such a situation, kobs=k−2+k2{[P]0/K−1+[P]0}Equation 4 where K −1 =k −1/k 1. The agreement between kinetically determined values of association constants (k 1/k −1) and those determined by the Scatchard analyses of the SPR data suggest that the association and dissociation reactions are monoexponential in nature and describe faithfully the overall energetics of the system (Fig. 2 A, inset). Moreover, the values ofK a determined by SPR data are close to those estimated from ITC studies, thus ruling out an appreciable contribution from any unobserved binding process to the overall energetics of the system. These results thus imply a single step bimolecular association reaction between these saccharides and the lectin. The “core” structure of the mannooligosaccharide recognized by the ASAI carbohydrate recognition domain appears to be the trimannoside (1) common to all the N-linked glycans (K a = 127 m−1at 25 °C), which is only a marginally poorer ligand than (3) (K a = 169m−1 at 25 °C). The equivalence of the observed binding parameters for the interaction of compounds (1)–(6) suggests that the Man3structure constitutes the minimal epitope recognized by the lectin and that its substitution at the reducing end with GlcNAc2 Asn does not alter either the mechanism or the extent of binding. As listed in Table I, the binding affinity for the mannose-containing oligosaccharides increases with increasing chain length, with a significant jump observed when extended with α-1,2-linked mannose residues at their nonreducing ends. These observations corroborate our previous study on the elucidation of the carbohydrate specificity of ASAI (10Dam T.K. Bachhawat K. Rani P.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5528-5535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Among the higher oligomers of mannose, the binding affinities for Man7 GlcNAc2 (I) (8), (10), and (11) are appreciably higher than those of the above compounds, indicating that the extension of the Man5 structure with α-1,2-mannosyl residues at its nonreducing end increases the binding potencies. However, a mere extension with a single mannosyl residue in the α-1,2 linkage at the α-1,3 branch, as in Man6 GlcNAc2(7) or Man6 GlcNAc2 Asn (7′), not only is inadequate but also perhaps compromises the binding. Additionally, these data suggest that a mere extension of the Man5 structure by an α-1,2Man, although necessary, is not sufficient to drive the reaction. The high affinities of (8), (10), and (11) suggest that the substitution of the α-1,6 branch by two α-1,2-linked mannosyl residues is apparently necessary for the moderate to strong binding to ASAI. Absence of this branch in (7), (7′), and Man7 GlcNAc2 (II) (9), therefore, make them nonbinders. A significant, 500-fold increase in the binding potency over manno pentaose is observed with (8) as the carbohydrate ligand (8.4×104m−1 at 25 °C), which has two α-1,2-linked mannosyl residues, one on the α-1,3 arm and the other on the α-1,6 arm. This suggests that for the combining site of ASAI to establish stronger bonding contacts, substitution with α-1,2-linked mannose residues on both the arms is sufficient. Moreover, extensions on the α-1,3 arm are recognized, subsequent to recognition of the α-1,2-linked mannose on the α-1,6 arm. These binding characteristics thereby implicate the α-1,2-linked mannose on the α-1,6arm to play a crucial role in lodging the complementary mannooligosaccharide in the ASAI combining site. Moreover, although (7) and (8) are structurally similar, an additional α-1,2-linked terminal mannose residue on the α-1,6 arm of (8) confers on it an exceedingly high binding affinity. This provides further insight into the mode of recognition of carbohydrate ligands by ASAI, where in the Manα (1Barre A. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. Rouge P. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Hester G. Kaku H. Goldstein I.J. Wright C.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) Man at the α-1,6 arm seems to drive the binding interaction further. In general, the binding constant (K a) is determined by the ratio of k 1 andk -1, and its value can increase with either an enhancement in the former or a decrease in the latter. For most enzyme-substrate interactions and also for the lectin-sugar interactions studied so far, it is the decrease in the dissociation rate constants that has been shown to be responsible for the increased binding affinities (25Clegg R.M. Loontiens F.G. Jovin T.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In these studies on ASAI-manno oligosaccharide interaction, the occurrence of both, i.e. an increase ink 1 and decrease in k -1, is implicated for the observed enhancement in affinities, although to a large extent it is the relatively more dramatic increase ink 1 that imparts to (10) and (11) their highest affinities. Thus, one of the interesting observations of this study is the significant increase in the association rate constants with the change in the structure of the manno oligosaccharide ligand. In conclusion, this study provides a molecular basis for explaining the exquisite specificity of ASAI for the high mannose oligosaccharides by demonstrating a stringent requirement for α-1,2-mannosyl substitution at their α-1,6 arms. Additionally, ASAI-manno oligosaccharide interactions constitute a unique example where the association rate constants vary dramatically by a factor of about 800 between the weakest and the strongest ligand."

Mutation of two other residues, neighboring glucose-binding residues in the catalytic site, also reduced the affinity for glucose as a stimulator of fructose phosphorylation. Among a series of glucose analogs, only 3, all substrates of glucokinase, stimulated fructose phosphorylation; other analogs were either inactive or inhibited glucokinase. Glucose increased the apparent affinity for inhibitors that are glucose analogs but not for the glucokinase regulatory protein or palmitoyl-CoA. These data indicate that the stimulatory effect of glucose on fructose phosphorylation reflects the positive cooperativity for glucose and is mediated by binding of glucose to the catalytic site. They support models involving the existence of two slowly interconverting conformations of glucokinase that differ through their affinity for glucose and for glucose analogs. We show by computer simulation that such a model can account for the kinetic properties of glucokinase, including the differential ability of mannoheptulose and N-acetylglucosamine to suppress cooperativity (Agius, L., and Stubbs, M.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), displays a sigmoidal saturation curve for its hexose substrate (3Parry M.J. Walker D.G. Biochem.

This property, which sensitizes the enzyme to changes in the blood glucose level, cannot be accounted for by classical models of cooperativity (6Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6108) Google Scholar, 7Koshland D.E. Némethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar), because glucokinase is a monomer (8Cardenas M.L. Rabajille E. Niemeyer H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sigmoidal behavior due to random, nonequilibrium addition of the two substrates, glucose and ATP-Mg (9Ferdinand W. Biochem. J. 1966; 98: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), can be excluded on the basis that there is no inhibition by ATP (10Cornish-Bowden A. Storer A.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Models that better account for the kinetic behavior of glucokinase assume the existence of two different conformations with different affinities for glucose that interconvert slowly (11Storer A.C. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Cardenas M.L. Rabajille E. Niemeyer H. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), thus allowing glucose to increase the proportion of the conformation with higher affinity. These kinetic models are supported (a) by the observation that cooperativity is lost when the rate of the reaction is slow, due to the use of a poor nucleotide substrate (13Pollard-Knight D. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or to the presence of a low ATP concentration and an inhibitory ADP concentration (11Storer A.C. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); (b) by the identification of slow kinetic transients (14Neet K.E. Keenan R.P. Tippett P.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); and (c) by the demonstration of slow conformational changes by fluorescence spectroscopy (15Lin S.X. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9670-9675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that the cooperativity is due to the existence of two binding sites for glucose, with regulatory and catalytic function, respectively, is usually ruled out (16Cornish-Bowden A. Cardenas M.L. J. Theor. Biol. 1987; 124: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) on the basis of experiments showing that glucose protects glucokinase against inactivation by a substrate analog,N-(N-bromoacetyl)-6-aminohexanoylglucosamine, with an hyperbolic instead of sigmoidal dependence on concentration (17Connolly B.A. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 99: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, Agius and Stubbs (18Agius L. Stubbs M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) recently observed that mannoheptulose, a competitive inhibitor of glucokinase, is more effective to decrease the Hill coefficient of this enzyme than other inhibitors such as N-acetylglucosamine or 5-thioglucose. This led them to postulate that mannoheptulose inhibits glucokinase by binding to a putative allosteric site for glucose. Fructose is known to be a poor substrate for glucokinase, displaying no (12Cardenas M.L. Rabajille E. Niemeyer H. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Scruel O.

Biophys. 2000; 375: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) cooperativity for this enzyme. Remarkably, fructose phosphorylation was shown to be markedly stimulated by glucose and, to a lesser extent, by mannose (19Scruel O. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 175: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The stimulation of fructose phosphorylation by glucose and its analogs could therefore be a simple way of probing the specificity of a putative allosteric site. In the present work we have further characterized the effect of glucose and its analogs on the phosphorylation of fructose by wild type glucokinase and by point mutants that have a reduced cooperativity or affinity for glucose. As the use of [14C]fructose in a radiochemical assay of glucokinase is hampered by the low affinity of the enzyme for this substrate, we have developed an enzymatic assay involving sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which allows the specific measurement of fructose 6-phosphate without interference by glucose 6-phosphate. Our results indicate that the stimulation exerted by glucose on the phosphorylation of fructose is mediated by binding of glucose to the catalytic site.

Chem. 1987; 262: 5455-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA from strain JM109 as a template and oligonucleotide primers with the following sequences: upstream primer, 5′-ggcgccatatg aatcaggttggcgttgtc-3′; downstream primer, 5′-cgctggatccatcagaacatcacctgaccg-3′. The upstream primer incorporates the starting codon (bold) in the Nde I restriction site (underlined), whereas the downstream primer incorporates a Bam HI restriction site (underlined) which flanks the termination codon (bold). The ∼0.8-kilobase pair amplified fragment was inserted in pET3a, and the resulting plasmid was used to overexpress sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in Bl21pLysS (25Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar). Expression was carried out in 1 liter of ZB medium at 19 °C for 40 h in the presence of 0.4 mm isopropylthiogalactoside. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 45 ml of homogenization buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and extracted in a French pressure cell. The extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and an ammonium sulfate fraction (15–30% of saturation) was prepared from the resulting supernatant. This fraction was resuspended in 2 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and chromatographed on a 1.6 × 70-cm Sephacryl S-200 HR column equilibrated with Buffer A. The active fractions were pooled and chromatographed on a 1.6 × 13-cm DEAE-Sepharose equilibrated in Buffer A supplemented with 10 mm NaCl; the column was washed with the same buffer, and protein was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (10–500 mm in 2 × 50 ml of Buffer A). About 5000 units of >95% homogeneous sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase could be obtained in this way. The enzyme had a specific activity of ∼200 μmol/min/mg. It was stored at 4 °C as a precipitate in 70% ammonium sulfate. In the course of its purification, sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was assayed at 30 °C through the change in A 340 in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 2 mm fructose 6-phosphate, and 0.15 mm NADH. Glucokinase was assayed spectrophotometrically at 30 °C in 1 ml of assay mixtures containing, unless otherwise indicated, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 2 mm ATP-Mg, 5 mmMgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and the indicated concentrations of substrates and effectors. Fructose 6-phosphate production was measured in the presence of 0.15 mm NADH and 2 units of sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; glucose 6-phosphate production, in the presence of 0.5 mm NAD+ and 10 μg/ml Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; and ADP formation, with 0.15 mm NADH, 0.25 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 10 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 10 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase. Results shown are means of at least three determinations ± S.E. Protein concentration was measured according to Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal.

To simplify the writing of equations derived from the model shown in Fig. 7, the concentrations of E, EG, E′, and E′G are called “A,” “B,” “C,” and “D,” and the concentration of glucose is termed “G.” Kinetic constants are symbolized by letters (a-h and m). Note that the product (a.g.d.f) is necessarily equal to (b.h.c.e). A system of four equations with 4 unknowns can be written as follows.

Equations Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4are derived from the consideration that, under steady state conditions,C, D, and B remain constant. A fifth equation allows one to calculate the rate of product formation.v=mDEquation 5 Values are assigned to the kinetic constants (see Fig. 7). The system of Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4 was solved by matrix calculus, andv was calculated for discrete concentrations of glucose using Microsoft Excel, Version 1998. Hill coefficients were calculated for substrate concentrations corresponding to ∼25% ofV max. To monitor specifically the formation of fructose 6-phosphate without interference of glucose 6-phosphate, we decided to use sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This bacterial enzyme catalyzes the reversible NADH-dependent conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to sorbitol 6-phosphate (24Yamada M. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5455-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The open reading frame encoding E. coli sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (24Yamada M. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5455-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into a pET3a expression vector (25Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar) and used to overexpress the enzyme. An activity of ∼40 μmol/min/mg protein was observed in extracts of cells induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as compared with 0.25 μmol/min/mg protein in cells that did not harbor the plasmid. The enzyme was purified by chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 and DEAE-Sepharose. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the preparation contained one single band with the expected size (26 kDa). The preparation was free from enzymes such as hexokinase and phosphoglucose isomerase, which could potentially interfere in the glucokinase assay. The K m for fructose 6-phosphate was 0.38 mm and that for NADH was 28 μm. Using this enzyme, we determined that, at pH 7.0, the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction [NAD+][sorbitol 6-phosphate]/[NADH][fructose 6-phosphate] amounted to 252 ± 17. In the presence of this enzyme and of NADH, glucokinase could be assayed with fructose as a substrate through the decrease inA 340. Similar rates were observed with this assay as with others in which the formation of fructose 6-phosphate is monitored through the reduction of NAD+ to NADH in the presence of phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or in which the formation of ADP is measured through the oxidation of NADH in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase (not shown). Fig.1 shows that human islet glucokinase displayed a positive cooperativity for fructose with an S0.5 of 580 mm and a Hill coefficient of about 1.5. Glucose suppressed this cooperativity and, at low concentrations, stimulated the enzyme, with S0.5 decreasing to about 170 mm in the presence of 4 mm glucose. At more elevated concentrations, glucose exerted competitive inhibition. As some authors (12Cardenas M.L. Rabajille E. Niemeyer H. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Scruel O. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 175: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) but not others (14Neet K.E. Keenan R.P. Tippett P.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Tiedge M. Richter T. Lenzen S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) reported a hyperbolic saturation curve for fructose, we also studied the fructose saturation curve under the conditions described by Cardenas et al. (12Cardenas M.L. Rabajille E. Niemeyer H. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but found sigmoidal kinetics similar to those shown in Fig. 1. We checked also enzymatically (27Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1988: 169-170Google Scholar) that the preparation of fructose that we used was not detectably contaminated by glucose (<0.01%). We therefore have no explanation for this discrepancy. The effect of glucose on fructose phosphorylation was further investigated in the experiment shown in Fig.2 in which the rates of both fructose and glucose phosphorylation have been recorded. Fructose phosphorylation was stimulated by a factor of up to about 6 by 5 mm glucose (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, glucose phosphorylation was not stimulated by fructose, but rather inhibited, particularly at the highest concentrations of glucose used (Fig. 2 B). Remarkably, the increment in the rate of fructose phosphorylation induced by glucose amounted in some cases to much more than the rate of glucose phosphorylation. Thus at 200 mm fructose, the increment of fructose phosphorylation induced by 1 mmglucose represented ∼18 μmol/min/mg as compared with a rate of glucose phosphorylation of ∼1.5 μmol/min/mg. It was previously shown that the cooperativity for glucose is lost when ATP is substituted by a poor phosphoryl donor such as ITP (13Pollard-Knight D. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or when the concentration of ATP is low, most particularly in the presence of ADP, which acts as a competitive inhibitor versus ATP (11Storer A.C. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows that the stimulation of the phosphorylation of 20 mm fructose by 5 mmglucose is about 6-fold in the presence of 0.4 to 5 mm ATP and that it is less than 2-fold in the presence of nucleotides that are poor substrates (ITP, CTP, GTP, and UTP) or when the enzyme is measured in the presence of a low concentration of ATP and an inhibitory concentration of ADP. There is a clear hyperbolic relationship between the rate of fructose phosphorylation in the absence of glucose and the relative stimulation exerted by glucose. Among a series of analogs that we tested, only three could stimulate fructose phosphorylation, mannose, 2-deoxyglucose, and glucosamine (Fig. 4). These compounds are all substrates for glucokinase, and their capacity to stimulate fructose phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A) correlated with their ability to be substrate (Fig. 4 B), mannose, and 2-deoxyglucose displaying, respectively, about 2- and 5-fold higher S0.5 values with Hill coefficients of 1.6 and 1.1. As expected, these substrates acted as inhibitors of fructose phosphorylation at more elevated concentrations. Other glucose analogs did not act as stimulators but only as inhibitors of fructose phosphorylation (Fig. 5 and not shown). These were either poor substrates of the enzyme (2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (K m = 50 mm,V max = 70% of the V maxwith glucose) and mannoheptulose (K m = 4 mm, V max = 0.2%, IC50 = 9 mm at 100 mm fructose) or pure inhibitors (5-thioglucose; IC50 = 2 mm),N-acetylglucosamine (IC50 = 2 mm),N-acetylmannosamine (IC50 = 60 mm),N-benzoylglucosamine (IC50 = 0.85 mm), and d-xylose (IC50 > 600 mm). The effect of some of these inhibitors was also tested in the presence of 5 mm glucose, which stimulated the enzyme about 4-fold. When activities were expressed relative to the activity measured in the absence of inhibitor, it appears that the apparent affinity for the inhibitors that are structural analogs of glucose was increased in the presence of glucose, whereas the inhibition exerted by other competitive inhibitors (Xenopus regulatory protein (21Veiga-da-Cunha M. Detheux M. Watelet N. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and acyl-CoAs (28Dawson C.M. Hales C.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 176: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29Tippett P.S. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12839-12845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was decreased in the presence of glucose (Fig. 5). Other compounds had no effect on the phosphorylation of fructose either in the presence or in the absence of glucose. These include (with the maximal concentration tested shown in parentheses) 1,5-anhydro-d-sorbitol (50 mm), α-methyl-d-glucoside (300 mm), 1,5-anhydro-d-mannitol (50 mm),d-allose (50 mm), d-galactose (250 mm), l-sorbose (600 mm), 6-deoxy-d-glucose (10 mm), andd-glucuronamide (100 mm) (not shown). To further investigate whether the stimulation exerted by glucose was linked to the positive cooperativity for this substrate, we investigated this effect in two point mutants (N166R and Y214A) that have been produced by substituting a glucokinase-specific residue with a residue in an equivalent position in hexokinases with low K m values. These mutants have a reduced Hill coefficient and an increased affinity for glucose without marked change in V max (23Veiga-da-Cunha, M., Xu, L. Z., Lee, Y. H., Marotta, D., Pilkis, S. J., and Van Schaftingen, E. Diabetologia39, 1173–1179Google Scholar, 22Moukil M.A. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The saturation curves for fructose were almost hyperbolic (Hill coefficients ≤ 1.2), and the S0.5 values equated 150 and 120 mm, respectively (not shown). As shown in Fig.6 A, glucose exerted a modest, maximally 1.6-fold stimulatory effect in these mutants as compared with the control (up to 4-fold). We have also investigated the effect of glucose on fructose phosphorylation in two glucokinase mutants in which a residue that is next to the glucose-binding residue Asn-204 or Asn-231 had been substituted (30St. Charles R. Harrison R.W. Bell G.I. Pilkis S.J. Weber I.T. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These mutants are V203A (which is combined with the incidental mutation D158A) and C230S. In each case, fructose phosphorylation was tested at a concentration corresponding to ∼15% of the V max value observed with glucose as substrate. As shown in Fig. 6 B, these two mutations increased the concentration of glucose required to half-maximally stimulate fructose phosphorylation by 8- and 2-fold, respectively, whereas the S0.5 values for glucose were increased by 12- and 2-fold (23Veiga-da-Cunha, M., Xu, L. Z., Lee, Y. H., Marotta, D., Pilkis, S. J., and Van Schaftingen, E. Diabetologia39, 1173–1179Google Scholar, 22Moukil M.A. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), respectively, compared with the appropriate controls. Because the results obtained did not indicate the existence of a second binding site for glucose, we decided to check whether a slow transition model could account for the kinetic properties of glucokinase, including the cooperativity for glucose and for fructose, the effect of glucose on fructose phosphorylation, the effect of mutations such as Y214A that reduce the Hill coefficient while increasing the apparent affinity for glucose, and the better ability of mannoheptulose as compared withN-acetylglucosamine to suppress cooperativity. To achieve this goal, we performed mathematical simulations of the model shown in Fig. 7, in which, for the sake of simplicity, the binding of ATP and the release of the two products ADP and glucose 6-phosphate are combined into one single irreversible step. Kinetic constants values (Fig. 7, seetable) were chosen so that (a) the interconversion between the two states was orders of magnitude slower than the binding of the substrate(s) or the formation of products and (b) state E′ had 3750-fold more affinity for glucose than state E. These values have been adjusted on a trial and error basis to mimic more closely the kinetic behavior of glucokinase. The set of parameters shown in Fig. 7 predicted an S0.5value of 8.4 mm for glucose and of 460 mm for fructose, with Hill coefficients of ∼1.7 and 1.4, respectively, close to the measured values. The effect of a mutation such as Y214A on the glucose saturation curve could be easily simulated by increasing the E′/E ratio at equilibrium by a factor of 100. This decreased the S0.5 value for glucose to 1.5 mm and the Hill coefficient to 1.16 (as compared with measured values of 1.3 mm and 1.2, respectively; see Ref. 22Moukil M.A. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The model also simulated the activation exerted by glucose on the phosphorylation of fructose. As observed experimentally, the increase in the rate of fructose phosphorylation was under some conditions “more than stoichiometric” with respect to the rate of glucose phosphorylation, and glucose phosphorylation was not detectably stimulated by fructose (Fig. 8). As expected, loss of cooperativity for glucose was observed when the rate of the catalytic step was reduced (e.g. a Hill coefficient of 1.2 was obtained when kinetic constant m was decreased from 100 to 3 s−1; not shown). The model could also account for the differential behavior ofN-acetylglucosamine and mannoheptulose, if one assumed that the difference between the affinities of the two states forN-acetylglucosamine was lower (by a factor of 100 in the simulation shown in Fig. 7, the E′ form having still 37.5-fold more affinity for N-acetylglucosamine than the E form) than for glucose, whereas it was the same for mannoheptulose as for glucose. Fig. 9 shows a plot of the Hill coefficient versus the S0.5 values for glucose in the presence of increasing concentrations of the two inhibitors. The curves corresponding to the values obtained by simulation are close to the experimental values reported by Agius and Stubbs (18Agius L. Stubbs M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results presented in this work extend the previous observations of Scruel et al. (19Scruel O. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 175: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that glucose stimulates the phosphorylation of fructose. We show in addition in this paper that this effect is largely reduced in two mutants (N166R and Y214A) that have a reduced cooperativity for glucose. Furthermore, the stimulation is also decreased when the activity of the wild type enzyme is reduced by replacing ATP by poorer phosphoryl donors, or when the ATP concentration is reduced, most particularly in the presence of ADP. Such a situation is known to decrease the Hill coefficient of the glucose saturation curve to ∼1.0 (11Storer A.C. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Pollard-Knight D. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the stimulation of fructose phosphorylation by glucose reflects the positive cooperativity for this substrate. Therefore, if a potential allosteric glucose-binding site existed in glucokinase as suggested by Agius and Stubbs (18Agius L. Stubbs M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), stimulation of fructose phosphorylation would be a good means to characterize it. In the present work, two pieces of evidence indicate, however, that such a site does not exist. A first one is the fact that two mutants that have a reduced affinity for glucose as a substrate, because of mutation of residues in the catalytic site next to glucose binding residues Asn-204 and Asn-231, also have a reduced affinity for glucose as a stimulator of fructose phosphorylation. Mutations affecting residues that directly interact with glucose (Asn-204, Asp-205, Glu-256, and Glu-290) are not informative in this respect, because they lead to proteins that have markedly decreased affinity for glucose and for other hexose substrates and that do not display sigmoidal kinetics (31Xu L.Z. Zhang W. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27458-27465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second new piece of evidence is that, among a series of sugars, only four (glucose, mannose, glucosamine, and 2-deoxyglucose), all substrates of glucokinase, were able to stimulate the phosphorylation of fructose. If glucokinase had an independent (allosteric) binding site for glucose that would favor the binding of glucose to the catalytic site, one would expect the existence of glucose analogs able to stimulate the phosphorylation of fructose without being substrate. However, no such compound was found among analogs modified on C1 to C6. Furthermore, the order of potency (glucose > mannose > 2-deoxyglucose) in the stimulation of fructose paralleled the capacity of these compounds to act as substrates. The same was true for glucosamine, which at low concentrations, was intermediate between glucose and mannose both as a substrate and as a stimulator of fructose phosphorylation. This, together with the lack of cooperativity in the presence of poor nucleotide substrates and the hyperbolic aspect of glucose binding to the enzyme, as estimated by protection from the inactivation byN-(N-bromoacetyl)-6-aminohexanoylglucosamine (17Connolly B.A. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 99: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or by fluorescence spectroscopy (15Lin S.X. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9670-9675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), strongly argues against the existence of an independent allosteric binding site. Because glucokinase is a monomer and because there is no evidence for a second binding site for glucose, the explanation for the cooperativity for glucose must be kinetic. Because explanations such as a random order of addition of substrate (9Ferdinand W. Biochem. J. 1966; 98: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or the recycling of an ADP-enzyme complex (32Pettersson G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) do not apply to glucokinase (10Cornish-Bowden A. Storer A.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the best models of cooperativity for glucokinase are those in which the enzyme undergoes a slow conformational change between two states with different affinities for glucose (11Storer A.C. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Cardenas M.L. Rabajille E. Niemeyer H. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of glucose on the phosphorylation of fructose (see Ref. 19Scruel O. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 175: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and this work), mannose (19Scruel O. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 175: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and 2-deoxyglucose 1M. A. Moukil and E. Van Schaftingen, unpublished results.indicate that the state that has a higher affinity for glucose also has a higher affinity for other substrates. As shown in this paper, it also has a higher affinity for glucose analogs that act as inhibitors, although not for other competitive inhibitors such as palmitoyl-CoA or the regulatory protein of glucokinase. The nature of this conformational change is still elusive as no crystal structure of glucokinase is yet available, but the localization of mutations that decrease cooperativity in the three-dimensional model of glucokinase derived from the structure of yeast hexokinase B (30St. Charles R. Harrison R.W. Bell G.I. Pilkis S.J. Weber I.T. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) may be instructive in this respect. Mutations that decrease cooperativity while considerably decreasing k cat values or the affinity for glucose are not informative in this respect, because their effect is most likely due to the slowing down of the catalytic cycle, similar to the effect of replacing ATP by poor phosphoryl donors in the wild type enzyme. However, two mutations (N166R and Y214A) decrease cooperativity while increasing the affinity for glucose and barely changing V max values. Interestingly, they involve residues that are in the hinge region, at some distance from the catalytic site, or at the interface between the two domains (22Moukil M.A. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because of the location of these residues, we postulate that, in addition to the classical open and closed states common to all hexokinases (33Anderson C.M. Stenkamp R.E. McDonald R.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 123: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 34Aleshin A.E. Zeng C. Bartunik H.D. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), glucokinase would also exist in a “super-open” state (Fig. 7). Because of the larger distance between the glucose binding residues present in the larger and smaller domains, this conformation would have a lower affinity for glucose and for its analogs than the open conformation. For an as yet unknown reason, this super-open form would only slowly equilibrate with the open conformation. By binding to the super-open conformation, glucose would facilitate partial closure of the catalytic cleft to the open state. Binding of ATP-Mg, complete closure of the catalytic cleft, and the phosphoryl transfer reaction would then ensue. Reopening of the catalytic cleft (to the open state) would be rapidly followed by extrusion of the products of the reaction, leaving the free enzyme in its high affinity state. The enzyme would then be more prone to catalyze the phosphorylation of any substrate (and to be inhibited by substrate analogs). If no substrate comes in time, the enzyme would “relax” to the super-open (low affinity) state. However, if sufficient substrate is present, the enzyme “recruited” by glucose to the open (high affinity) state can undergo several additional cycles with another substrate such as fructose before relaxing to the super-open state, explaining the more than stoichiometric stimulation of fructose phosphorylation that we observed. Functionally, this model is similar to the one proposed by Storer and Cornish-Bowden (11Storer A.C. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and differs from the slow transition model of Cardenas et al. (12Cardenas M.L. Rabajille E. Niemeyer H. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) in that catalysis can only occur with the high affinity state. Testing of the model by mathematical simulations indicates that it can account for the sigmoidal behavior of glucokinase with both glucose and fructose as substrates, for the effect of mutations that decrease cooperativity, and for the stimulation of fructose phosphorylation by glucose. It can also account for the differential behavior of N-acetylglucosamine and mannoheptulose on the kinetics of glucokinase if one admits that the difference between the affinities of the two states is larger in the case of mannoheptulose than in the case ofN-acetylglucosamine. This difference may be because of the presence of a bulkier substituent on C2 than on the corresponding carbon in mannoheptulose. We are indebted to G. Noël for the production of sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and help in preliminary experiments, to J.-J. Van Schaftingen for guidance in mathematical simulations, and to H.-G. Hers, M.

Malonyl-CoA serves as the active donor of two carbon atoms in fatty acid synthesis and strongly inhibits fatty acid β-oxidation by acting as a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (1Awan M.M. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2McGarry J.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I resides on the surface of the mitochondrial membrane and generates palmitoylcarnitine from palmitoyl-CoA. This step is critical for fatty acid β-oxidation because cytosolic fatty acyl-CoA cannot translocate into the mitochondria where fatty acid β-oxidation occurs. Palmitoylcarnitine is transported into mitochondra by a carrier system and then reconverted into palmitoyl-CoA by carnitine palmitoyltransferase II. This shuttle system is the first step of fatty acid β-oxidation, which supplies tissues with energy. Mammals have two major isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The 265-kDa isoform, designated as ACCα, is highly expressed in liver and adipose tissues, and the 280-kDa isoform, designated as ACCβ, is predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle (3Thampy K.G.

Human ACCα and ACCβ have about 80% amino acid sequence homology and both produce malonyl-CoA. They are, however, encoded by separate genes, mapped to chromosome 17q21 and 12q23.1, respectively, and show distinct tissue distribution and nutritional regulation (6Abu-Elheiga L.

It has been suggested that ACCβ may play a role in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation in muscle tissues.

One of the sequence motifs characterized as a critical regulatory component in muscle gene expression is the E-box (CANNTG) (15Ceccarelli E. McGrew M.J. Nguyen T. Grieshammer U. Horgan D. Hughes S.H.

Muscle-specific genes, such as muscle creatine kinase, myosin light chain, and myogenin genes, have multiple E-boxes in their enhancers or promoters that act cooperatively to regulate gene transcription (18Amacher S.L.

In muscle cells, E-proteins dimerize with muscle-related bHLH transcription factors, called muscle regulatory factors (MRFs), enabling the MRFs to act on muscle-specific regulatory elements (21Lassar A.B.

Because there are several E-boxes on the ACCβ promoter, we expected that the muscle-specific expression of ACCβ might be explained by the responsiveness of its promoter to MRFs. In this study, we report the fact that ACCβ is transcriptionally activated by MyoD through the E-boxes on its promoter. We also report a novel cis-acting element which serves as an MRF-binding site and is critically required for the MyoD-mediated ACCβ promoter activation. Elaboration upon the transcriptional regulation of ACCβ in the context of myogenesis-related factors might provide further understanding of the muscle-specific expression of ACCβ. Previous isolation of the ACCβ cDNA from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library (7Ha J. Lee J.K. Kim K.S. Witters L.A. Kim K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11466-11470Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) yielded two cDNA clones with different 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTR) of 300 and 42 bp, respectively. 2J-J. Lee, Y-A. Moon, J-H. Ha, D-J. Yoon, Y-H. Ahn, and K-S. Kim, unpublished data. In the presence of the sense primer (5′-ATGTAACCCTGAATGCACGGTGGGGAGGACAT-3′) of the 300 bp 5′-UTR and the antisense primer (5′-TCACTGGGGATGCAGCCACCAGCTCCATT-3′) of the 42-bp 5′-UTR, PCR using human genomic DNA as a template produced a 14.5-kb DNA fragment spanning these two 5′-UTRs. The PCR reaction was performed using ExpandTM Long Template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR was set at 94 °C for 10 s for denaturation, at 60 °C for 30 s for annealing, and at 68 °C for 8 min for extension and repeated for 30 cycles. After the final cycle, the elongation was carried out at 68 °C for 7 min. The amplified DNA fragment was subcloned into pGEM4Z (Promega) and its restriction map was determined (Fig. 1 A). The 5′-flanking region of the 300-bp 5′-UTR was obtained by inverse PCR. Ten μg of human genomic DNA was digested with 50 units of EcoRI and followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The precipitated DNA was self-ligated in the volume of 1 ml using T4 DNA ligase (100 units) at 16 °C for 14 h. Self-ligated DNA was precipitated by ethanol after phenol/chloroform extraction, and was dissolved in 20 μl of TE buffer (pH 8.0). The flanking sequence of 300 bp 5′-UTR was amplified by PCR using 5′ antisense primer (5′-CCTGGAGCACTTAACCTTAACCTTCA-3′), and 3′ sense primer (5′-TAAGCAGCAAGCAGGCTTAG-3′), and 0.5 μg of self-ligated DNA. The amplified DNA was subcloned into pGEM4Z and sequenced. An oligonucleotide (5′-CAGGAAAAGGTCAGACAGACAGGA-3′), complementary to the region +37 to +56 from the ATG codon of ACCβ was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligonucleotide (105 cpm) was mixed with 1 μg of human skeletal muscle poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) in 10 μl of 25 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 400 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The mixture was incubated at 70 °C for 3 min, then slowly cooled down to 37 °C and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Annealed primer/RNA was precipitated by adding 25 μl of ethanol and used for extension reaction. This primer was extended with 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 1 h under the buffer conditions the manufacturer recommended. After phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v) extraction and ethanol precipitation, the size of primer extension product was determined by 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The nucleotide numbering of the ACCβ promoter was based on the transcription start site proved by primer extension analysis. To confirm that the primer extension product contains the 5′-UTR of the ACCβ cDNA, the primer extension product was isolated from the denaturing polyacrylamide gel and used as a template in following PCR. Primers used in the PCR were the 5′ sense primer corresponding to the region −72 to −53, or −55 to −34 from the ATG codon and the 3′ antisense primer used in primer extension analysis. The size of the PCR products was determined on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel. Total RNAs were extracted from Alexander cells, HepG2 cells, and human skeletal muscle, using the TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA in 20 μl of reaction volume using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Each reverse transcription mixture (0.5 μl) was used as the template for amplifying ACCβ cDNA. The PCR primers for the 5′ terminal region of ACCβ transcript, spanning exon 1b and exon 2, were the sense primer corresponding to the region −72 to −53 from the ATG codon and the antisense primer same as that used in the primer extension analysis. The ACCβ cDNA corresponding to the region +6001 to +7000 from the ATG codon and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA were amplified using following primers: ACCβ sense, 5′-TCCAACAACCAGCTGGGTGGCGTTC-3′; ACCβ antisense, 5′-CCAGCATCCGGCCGGGTGTGTCATG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sense, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antisense, 5′-GGAGACCTTCTGCTCAGTCGACG-3′. The sizes of the PCR products were determined on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel or on 1.0% agarose gels. The PIIβ promoter-reporter construct of pPIIβ−1317 was generated by subcloning the 3′ 1.4-kb XbaI fragment (−1317 to +65) of the 14.5-kb PCR product into SmaI site of pGL3-Basic (Promega). The constructs designated as pPIIβ−1090, pPIIβ−569, pPIIβ−349, and pPIIβ−203 were produced by self-ligation of pPIIβ−1317 after digestion with KpnI,KpnI/ApaI, KpnI/DraI, andKpnI/HindIII, respectively. The constructs of pPIIβ−800, pPIIβ−93, pPIIβ−38, and pPIIβ+7 were generated by insertion of the DNA fragments amplified by PCR into SmaI site of pGL3-Basic. The construct of pPIIβ−1317/+17 was produced by ligation of the 4.5-kb NarI-flushed/XbaI fragment of pPIIβ-1317 and 1.7-kb SmaI/XbaI luciferase gene of pGL3-Basic. The construct, pPIIβ−1317/+3 was prepared by subcloning the DNA fragment from −1317 to +3 of PIIβ amplified by PCR into SmaI site of pGL3-Basic. Mutant constructs were generated employing QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagen) using the mutagenic oligonucleotides. Every mutated sequence is explained in the legends to Figs. 5 and 6, and the sequences of all mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The construction of the pE-box-tk-luc and the p6×(+8/+27)-tk-luc was performed by inserting −569 to −204 of PIIβ and six copies of the fragment from +8 to +27 of PIIβ, respectively, into the upstream of the tk promoter of ptk-luc, a tk-promoter-luciferase reporter construct.Figure 6Region B has several putativecis-elements for the basal transcription and the MyoD responsiveness. A, DNA sequences from −43 to +30 is shown to describe the five mutations introduced in region B and the five probes used in B and C. B, the MyoD-stimulated activities of the five mutant reporters were measured by transient transfection with co-transfection of pcMyoD into NIH3T3 cells. The basal activity of each tested mutant is shown in theinset. Reporter (0.4 μg) and pCMV β-galactosidase (0.2 μg) were transfected into NIH3T3 cells with pcMyoD or pcDNA3 (0.4 μg each). The reporter activities are shown as the relative luciferase activity normalized by the β-galactosidase activity. The data represents the mean ± S.D. of five independent experiments performed in triplicate. C, probes (Pr1 to Pr5) presented at the bottom of A were subjected to an EMSA to test the binding of MyoD (150 ng).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The established cell lines, obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), were cultured in the recommended media (H9C2 in DMEM/F12; Alexander in MEM; HeLa in MEM; NIH3T3 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C under 5% CO2, 95% air. All cell culture materials were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. For the transient transfection assay, cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105cells/35-mm dish. On the next day, transfection was performed with 0.4 μg of the indicated pPIIβ-luciferase constructs, 0.2 μg of the pCMV β-galactosidase plasmid (CLONTECH) and the indicated amounts of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pcMyoD, or pcE12. The pcMyoD and pcE12 plasmids were kindly provided by Stephan F. Konieczny (Purdue University) and express MyoD and E12, respectively, under the control of the cytomegalovirus IE promoter. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 3 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 2 days, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) and lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and normalized by the β-galactosidase activities to correct for the transfection efficiency. All plasmid DNA for transfections was purified by Qiagen Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen Inc.) A human skeletal muscle cDNA library was screened employing the Matchmaker one-hybrid system (CLONTECH). All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the construction of a target-reporter yeast strain, 3 copies of the 20-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides from −42/−23, −10/+10, and +8/+27 was inserted into the SacI site of pHisi-1 and pLacZi. The resulting plasmids were linearized and transformed intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain YM4271 by the lithium acetate method, and the transformants were selected on SD-His,Ura solid medium for integration of the target-reporter construct into theHIS3 locus. To screen the clones expressing the proteins that bind to the target sequences in vivo, a human skeletal muscle cDNA library constructed in pGAD10 was introduced into the above transformed YM4271. pGAD10, the expression vector of the Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid system produces the inserted gene product as a C terminus of GAL4 activation domain-fusion protein. Clones were selected on SD-His,Ura,Leu solid medium containing 40 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma). Plasmids isolated from the selected yeast clones were transformed into the Escherichia colistrain DH5α and subjected to sequencing for identification. Recombinant MyoD and E47 were expressed in E. coli SG13009[pREP4] containing pQT-MyoD or pQT-E47, kindly provided by Stephan F. Konieczny. Expression plasmids of pET-Myf6 and pGST-Myf4 were prepared by inserting Myf6 or Myf4 cDNA intoBamHI/HindIII sites of pET-21a (Novagene) orEcoRI/XhoI sites of pGEX4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. Myf6 and GST-Myf4 were prepared in E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli DH5α, respectively. The bacteria freshly transformed with each expression vector were grown to mid-log phase and proteins were induced for 4 h with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication. The recombinant proteins containing histidine-tag were purified to homogeneity by Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography. GST-Myf4 was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The purity and the concentration of the recombinant proteins were verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The EMSA probes used are as follows (sequence of sense oligomers are presented here); E1 (−418/−394), 5′-CCCTTGGAACATCTGTCGATGCTG-3′; E2 (−435/−412), 5′-GGCGTCTGACAGATGAACCCCTTG-3′; E3 (−512/−489), 5′-CTGTGTGTCCAGCTGGCCATTCGT-3′; Pr1 (−43/−15) 5′-CAGCCTCCCGCTGAAAGGTGACACTCTGCC-3′; Pr2 (−33/−15), 5′-CTGAAAGGTGACACTCTGCC-3′; Pr3 (−24/+4), 5′-GACACTCTGCCAGCTGGGTTCCCTTAGT-3′; Pr4 (−10/+10), 5′-TGGGTTCCCTTAGTCACCCT-3′; Pr5 (+4/+29), 5′-TCACCCTGTGGGCGCCTGTCAGCCTC-3′. Pr5 mutants used for competition assay are shown at Fig. 7 A. Each sense oligonucleotide was labeled with polynucleotide kinase (Takara) using [γ-32P]ATP as substrate and annealed with 5-fold excess of its complementary, unlabeled oligonucleotide by heating at 90 °C for 5 min and allowing it to slowly cool to room temperature in 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl. The annealed probe was purified by spun column chromatography and probes of 100,000 cpm were used for each reaction. Recombinant MyoD, GST-Myf4, Myf6, or MyoD/E47 heterodimer were incubated with the prepared probes in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 75 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 0.5% fetal calf serum. After 20 min incubation at room temperature, samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) at 250 V for ∼1 h at room temperature. For the competition assays, competitors prepared by annealing the unlabeled sense and antisense oligonucleotides were added at ∼50–200-fold molar excess for each competition assay. Two ACCβ cDNA clones containing different 5′-UTRs of 300 and 42 bp, respectively, were previously isolated from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library (7Ha J. Lee J.K. Kim K.S. Witters L.A. Kim K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11466-11470Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A sense primer based on the 300-bp 5′-UTR and an antisense primer based on the 42-bp 5′-UTR were used to amplify a 14.5-kb product. To clone the upstream sequence of the 300-bp 5′-UTR, inverse PCR was performed using circular genomic DNA self-ligated after EcoRI digestion as template. The resulting 3.5-kb DNA fragment contained 2.3-kb upstream and 1.2-kb downstream sequences of the 300-bp 5′-UTR. The cloning strategy used to obtain the 17-kb 5′-flanking sequence and its restriction map are shown in Fig.1 A. The regions of 300- and 42-bp 5′-UTRs were named as exon 1a and exon 1b, respectively, and their 5′-flanking sequences were designated as PIβ and PIIβ. To determine the transcription initiation site of ACCβ, a32P-labeled primer complementary to the region +37 to +56 from the ATG codon of ACCβ cDNA was extended using human skeletal muscle poly(A)+ RNA as template. The products were analyzed on a sequencing gel and a single 132-bp fragment was observed (Fig.1 B, a). Because the primer-extension gave only one product smaller than the 300-bp 5′-UTR, we performed PCRs to confirm whether it contained the sequence of the 42-bp 5′-UTR. The 132-bp fragment was isolated from the sequencing gel slice and used as a template, and two 5′ sense primers corresponding to the 42-bp 5′-UTR and one common 3′ antisense primer of the previous primer extension, were used. Those primers amplified two PCR products of our expecting sizes, 111 bp (−55/+56) and 128 bp (−72/+56), respectively. This result suggests that the ACCβ mRNA in muscle originates from PIIβ (Fig.1 B, b). The first transcribed nucleotide of PIIβ, determined by the primer extension, was designated as +1 for numbering the nucleotides in the ACCβ gene. We tested the promoter activities of the 5′-flanking fragments of those two 5′-UTRs. The PIIβ region from −1317 to +65 showed high promoter activity in H9C2 myoblast cells, while the 2.3-kb PIβ region upstream of the 300-bp 5′-UTR did not have transcription activity at all in various cell lines. Computer-based analysis (MatInspector V2.2 based on Transfac 4.0) of PIIβ revealed several transcription factor-binding sites including multiple E-boxes (Fig.2). Therefore, in this study we investigated the cis-elements and trans-acting factors involved in the transcription regulation of PIIβ promoter. According to previous reports of the tissue-specific expression of ACCβ (6Abu-Elheiga L. Almarza-Ortega D.B. Baldini A. Wakil S.J. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we tested the promoter activity of the −1317 to +65 fragment in various cell lines. A transiently transfected luciferase reporter construct (pPIIβ-1317) showed the highest promoter activity in H9C2, a rat cardiomyoblast cell line. However, its promoter activity was very low or hardly detectable in Alexander, a human hepatoma cell line, in HeLa, a human cervical carcinoma cell line, or in NIH3T3, a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (Fig. 3 A). The extremely low activity of pPIIβ−1317 in Alexander cells was rather intriguing, because ACCβ expression has been observed in human liver and HepG2, another human hepatoma cell line (6Abu-Elheiga L. Almarza-Ortega D.B. Baldini A. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10669-10677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 26Wentworth B.M. Donoghue M. Engert J.C. Berglund E.B. Rosenthal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The inactiveness of this promoter in Alexander cells suggested that liver might employ another promoter for ACCβ expression. To explore whether a different promoter from PIIβ drives ACCβ expression in liver, we examined if the ACCβ mRNA in liver cell lines has different 5′-UTR from that of muscle tissue. We prepared cDNAs from total RNA of Alexander cells, and HepG2 cells, and human skeletal muscle tissue to perform RT-PCR. Only the muscle cDNA generated the 128-bp PCR product containing 5′-UTR (exon 1b) sequences, while those three cDNAs produced a 1-kb product for the C terminus coding region (Fig. 3 B). Both muscle and liver definitely express the ACCβ mRNAs but the mRNAs in those two tissues have different 5′-UTRs. These results strongly imply the presence of liver-type ACCβ promoter, and we concluded that PIIβ is the muscle-type ACCβ promoter. The multiple E-boxes picked up by the computer-based analysis suggested MRFs might act on the PIIβ (Fig. 2). Overexpression of MyoD, a typical MRF, indeed activated the transiently transfected ACCβ promoter effectively in every cell line except in HeLa cells (Fig.3 A). Its relative activation by MyoD in H9C2 cells is lower than in NIH3T3 cells or Alexander cells due to high basal transcription activity in H9C2 cells, probably caused by the endogenous myogenic transcription factors. We therefore used NIH3T3 cells for further experiments instead of myoblast cells to exclude the effect of endogenous MyoD and other muscle related factors. To identify the MyoD-responsive regions in this promoter, we constructed a group of deletion reporters containing the PIIβ promoter serially deleted from the 5′ or 3′ end of the −1317 to +65 fragment (Fig. 4). The deletion of −569 to −349 and −38 to −19, among the 5′ deletion constructs, most drastically decreased the MyoD responsiveness. Deletion of the 220 bp from −569 to −349, containing a cluster of three E-boxes, decreased the MyoD responsiveness by about 50%. The reduced responsiveness was recovered in further deletions up to −39, suggesting the presence of inhibitory elements for MyoD responsiveness in the region from −340 to −39. The deletion from −93 to −39, where Sp1 can bind, most outstandingly enhanced the MyoD responsiveness. Although we cannot reveal the prescise mechanisms involved in this inhibitory action in the present study, the Sp1-binding site in this inhibitory region is considered to be"

Man5GlcNAc2Asn added to CTLL-2 cell cultures inhibited not only phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases but also IL-2-dependent cell proliferation. We found that a complex of IL-2, IL-2 receptor α, β, γ subunits, and tyrosine kinases was formed in rhIL-2-stimulated CTLL-2 cells.

Willerford D.M. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From these observations, it is suggested that a complex consisting of at least IL-2, IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, IL-2Rγ, and tyrosine kinases including Lck, Jak1, and Jak3 might be formed in CTLL-2 cells stimulated by IL-2. However, it has been reported that each IL-2 receptor subunit alone shows only weak binding to IL-2. IL-2Rα binds IL-2 with low affinity (K d ∼10 nm), IL-2Rβ binds IL-2 with very low affinity (K d ∼100 nm), and IL-2Rγ has no measurable affinity for IL-2 (8Arima N. Kamio M. Imada K. Hori T.

Accordingly, the mechanism by which IL-2 stimulates the formation of a high affinity IL-2-IL-2Rα, -β, or -γ complex remains unclear. Although research on the carbohydrate recognition of IL-2 has a long history, its physiological function has not been clearly determined. Sherblom et al. (11Sherblom A.P. Sathyamoorthy N. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 939-944PubMed Google Scholar) and Zanetta et al. (12Zanetta J.-P. Alonso C. Michalski J.-C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) reported that IL-2 recognizes high-mannose type glycans with five or six mannosyl residues as determined by the plate method. Later, Najjamet al. (13Najjam S. Mulloy B. Theze J. Gordon M. Gibbs R. Rider C.C. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) found that rhIL-2 binds to heparin specifically. However, since the addition of heparin did not show any inhibitory effect on IL-2-dependent cell proliferation, it was suggested that the interaction between IL-2 and heparin is not related to such activity. Zanetta et al. (12Zanetta J.-P. Alonso C. Michalski J.-C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) presented a cross-linking model in which it was hypothesized that, in the case of human peripheral lymphocytes, IL-2 binds to not only the IL-2 receptor via the IL-2 receptor-binding sites but also the TCR complex containing glycosylated CD3 (12Zanetta J.-P. Alonso C. Michalski J.-C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This tentative model was proposed on the basis of the results of analysis of immunoprecipitates obtained using IL-2Rβ antibody. However, they did not directly show that phosphorylation of Lck kinase co-immunoprecipitated with IL-2Rβ subunit occurs, or that high-mannose type glycan has an inhibitory effect on IL-2-dependent cell proliferation. Accordingly, whether the carbohydrate recognition activity of IL-2 contributes to the physiological function of IL-2 still remains unclear. Moreover, it has been reported recently that the catalytic activation of Jak1 and Jak3 kinases is induced within minutes after formation of a IL-2·IL-2 receptor high-affinity complex (5Tanaka N.

In this paper, we report that addition of high-mannose type glycans inhibits not only IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cell proliferation but also the phosphorylation of the related tyrosine kinases including Jak1, Jak3, Lck, and Lyn. Furthermore, a high affinity complex including IL-2Rα, -β, -γ subunits, and Jak1, Jak3, Lck, Lyn tyrosine kinases is formed in IL-2-stimulated CTLL-2 cells. Among the co-immunoprecipitated components of the complex, only the IL-2Rα subunit was stained with Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) which specifically recognizes high-mannose type glycans (14Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 728-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the staining was diminished after digestion of the glycans with Man5GlcNAc2-specific endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase D (Endo D) (15Tai T.

Our findings suggest that dual binding of IL-2 to both a Man5GlcNAc2 moiety and a specific peptide sequence in the IL-2 receptor α subunit serves to trigger the formation of a high-affinity complex of IL-2- IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ subunits, leading to cellular signaling. Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) and Endo D were obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan).

Inazu, Noguchi Institute, Tokyo, Japan. cDNA encoding human IL-2 (RandD Systems Europe Ltd., Abingdon, UK) was used to produce rhIL-2 inEscherichia coli. Plasmid pET3a (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) containing a T7 promoter was used as the rhIL-2 expression plasmid. ANdeI-HindIII fragment corresponding to a synthetic human IL-2 gene was inserted between theNdeI and HindIII sites of pET3a to produce the expression plasmid. The rhIL-2 gene was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) under the control of the T7 promoter. A 15-ml culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the IL-2 plasmid was incubated overnight until the cells reached the stationary phase of growth and this culture was used to inoculate 500 ml of L broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After incubation for 2.5 h at 37 °C, IL-2 production was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactoside, and the cells were grown for 2.5 h. IL-2 was produced mainly in inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were solubilized and IL-2 was refolded by a method described previously (18Tsuji T. Nakagawa R. Sugimoto N. Fukuhara K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3129-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with slight modification, as follows. The cells were collected by centrifugation and homogenized by lysozyme treatment and sonication at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the precipitate was collected. The pellet was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3) containing 10 mm EDTA and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. Then, the solution was treated with 10 mm reduced glutathione and 1 mm oxidized glutathione in the presence of 2 m guanidine hydrochloride at pH 8.0. The solution was kept for 16 h at room temperature, then it was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. An aliquot of the dialysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 15% acrylamide gel to check the purity of the rhIL-2. The biological activity of the recovered soluble rhIL-2 protein was determined in a proliferation assay using CTLL-2 cells. Human IL-2 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. was used as the standard for the units of activity. Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The amount of activity displayed by the rhIL-2 used in this study was 1–10 units/ng. Mouse T cell line CTLL-2 (RCB0637) was obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Ibaraki, Japan). CTLL-2 cells were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml rhIL-2 at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were cultured until the cell density reached 1.5 × 106cells/ml and the culture was then split. For the bioassay, 2 days after the last addition of rhIL-2, the cells were washed three times in RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were then resuspended in complete medium at a cell density of 1 × 105 cells/ml and plated out in microtiter plates, 100 μl/well. Then 100 μl of rhIL-2 at various concentrations, diluted in complete RPMI 1640 medium, was added. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 2 days, then 20 μl of Cell Titer 96TM Aqueous one solution reagent was added to each well. After incubating the mixture for 2 h, the absorbance at 525 nm was read using a dual wavelength flying spot scanning densitometer CS-9300PC (Shimazu Corp. Kyoto, Japan). Cell Titer 96TM Aqueous one solution reagent used to measure cell proliferation activity was obtained from Promega Corp.The solution is composed of a novel tetrazolium compound and an electron coupling reagent, phenazine ethosulfate in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.0). Manα1→6(Manα1→3)Manα1→6(Manα1→3) Manβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→4GlcNAc-Asn(Man5GlcNAc2Asn) and Manα1→6(Manα1→3)Manα1→6(Manα1→2Manα1→3)Manβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→4GlcNAc-Asn (Man6GlcNAc2Asn) were prepared by exhaustive Pronase digestion of ovalbumin followed by Dowex 50 × 2 (H+ form) column chromatography (200–400 mesh, 1.5 × 150 cm) according to the method described by Taiet al. (15Tai T. Yamashita K. Ogata-Arakawa M. Koide N. Muramatsu T. Iwashita S. Inoue Y. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8569-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (Manα1→2)2–4[Manα1→6- (Manα1→3)Manα1→6(Manα1→3)]Manβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→4GlcNAc (Man7GlcNAc2, Man8GlcNAc2, Man9GlcNAc2) and Manα1→6 (Manα1→3)Manβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→4GlcNAc (Man3GlcNAc2) were prepared from 3 g of porcine thyroglobulin glycopeptides by hydrazinolysis followed by re-N-acetylation, and Man7–9GlcNAc2were each isolated by Bio-Gel P-4 (under 400 mesh, 2.0 × 100 cm) column chromatography. Each oligosaccharide was converted to the asparaginyl oligosaccharide from Man7–9GlcNAc2 and Fmoc-conjugated Asn-GlcNAc by treatment with A. protophormiaeendo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase according to the method described by Kuge et al. (19Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The structures of these different glycoasparagines and oligosaccharides were determined through a combination of methylation analysis (20Yamashita K. Hitoi A. Matsuda Y. Tsuji A. Katumuna N. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1098-1107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), α-mannosidase digestion, partial acetolysis (21Tai T. Yamashita K. Ito S. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6687-6694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). To investigate the phosphorylation of kinases in the presence and absence of Man5GlcNAc2Asn, the following experiments were performed. CTLL-2 cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, suspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in the absence of IL-2. The cells were then stimulated with rhIL-2 (5 units/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 10 μm Man5GlcNAc2Asn, followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells (1 × 107 cells/lane) were lysed for 60 min on ice by adding 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 kallikrein units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 1.5 × 104 rpm and used for the immunoprecipitation. The tyrosine kinases were individually immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-Jak1, anti-Jak3 (Upstate Biotechnology, NY), anti-Lyn, or anti-Lck antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After fractionation of the immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were then probed with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10, UBI) and with the appropriate second antibody and visualized by means of the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were stripped with 62.5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.7) containing 2% SDS and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min and reprobed with anti-Jak1, anti-Jak3, anti-Lyn, or anti-Lck antibody to evaluate the amount of the corresponding tyrosine kinase. To detect any glycoprotein with high-mannose type glycans among the constituents of the IL-2 receptor complex, the following experiments were performed. Cells (1 × 107 cells/lane) which had been cultured continuously in the presence of IL-2 were lysed by adding 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 kallikrein units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm mannolactone (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubating the mixture for 60 min on ice. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 1.5 × 104 rpm and used for the immunoprecipitation. The supernatants of the cell lysates were treated with rabbit anti-IL-2Rα, anti-IL-2Rβ, or anti-IL-2Rγ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol and the immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The immunoprecipitates were then probed with anti-IL-2Rα, -β, -γ, anti-Lck, anti-Jak1, anti-Jak3, or anti-Lyn antibody and with the appropriate second antibody and visualized by means of the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Otherwise, membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h in the presence or absence of Endo H (10 milliunits/100 μl of citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6.5)/cm2) or Endo D (10 milliunits/100 μl of citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6.5)/cm2) and stained with biotinylated GNA (80 μg/ml), followed by treatment with avidin peroxidase, and visualized by means of the ECL system. Then, the blot was reprobed with anti-IL-2Rα subunit antibody and with the appropriate second antibody and visualized. G. nivalis agglutinin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. and sulfo-NHS-biotin was obtained from Pierce. 1 mg of GNA was dissolved in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and 1 mg of sulfo-NHS-biotin was dissolved in 1 ml of distilled water. The GNA solution was mixed with 30 μl of sulfo-NHS-biotin solution and left to stand on ice for 2 h. After dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, the biotinylated GNA was used as a probe. It is known that IL-2 specifically recognizes high-mannose type glycans with 5 or 6 mannosyl residues (11Sherblom A.P. Sathyamoorthy N. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 939-944PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zanetta J.-P. Alonso C. Michalski J.-C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We studied whether the lectin activity is indispensable for induction of IL-2-dependent cell proliferation. As the first step, we investigated whether this process is inhibited by addition of high-mannose type glycans. It is known that CTLL-2 cells, a mouse T-cell line, proliferate in a manner dependent on IL-2. Upon incubating the cells (1 × 104/well) in the presence of rhIL-2 at 5 units/ml for 48 h, the cells showed a proliferative response which was dependent on the concentration of rhIL-2 (Fig. 1 A). The extent of cell proliferation was determined colorimetrically (see “Experimental Procedures”). Since the concentration of rhIL-2 required to stimulate maximum IL-2-dependent cell proliferation was found to be 5 units/ml, the following experiments were performed at this concentration. Mixtures were prepared containing 5 units/ml rhIL-2 and high-mannose type glycans at various concentrations and, after being left standing for 2 h at 37 °C, the mixtures were added to the wells containing the cultured cells. In this experiment, Man5GlcNAc2Asn and Man6GlcNAc2Asn were found to dose dependently inhibit the proliferative response of these cells to rhIL-2 in vitro, whereas Man7GlcNAc2Asn, Man8GlcNAc2Asn, Man9GlcNAc2Asn, and Man3GlcNAc2 did not show any inhibitory effect (Fig. 1 B). These results suggested that the lectin activity of IL-2 is required for stimulation of IL-2-dependent T-cell proliferation. It has been reported that, in the case of IL-2-induced proliferation of CTLL-2 cells, signal transduction occurs via tyrosine kinases including Lck (4Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), Jak1, and Jak3 (5Tanaka N. Asao H. Ohbo K. Ishii N. Takeshita T. Nakamura M. Sasaki H. Sugamura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7271-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Johnston J.A. Kawamura M. Kirken R.A. Chen Y.Q. Blake T.B. Shibuya K.

Nature. 1994; 370: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, we found that Lyn is also phosphorylated as a result of IL-2 stimulation in CTLL-2 cells. Although Lyn was originally reported to be phosphorylated as a result of IL-2 stimulation in a B-cell line, whether the association site is IL-2Rβ or -γ remains to be determined (22Torigoe T. Saragovi H.U. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2674-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To further confirm whether the lectin activity of IL-2 modulates the cellular signal transduction mechanism, phosphorylation of Jak1, Jak3, Lck, and Lyn were comparatively studied in the presence and absence of Man5GlcNAc2Asn in the medium. After culturing the cells in the absence of IL-2 for 6 h, CTLL-2 cells in G0 phase were stimulated with rhIL2 (10 units/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of Man5GlcNAc2Asn (10 μm). Then, the cells (1 × 107 cells/lane) were solubilized and proteins in the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak1, anti-Jak3, anti-Lck, or anti-Lyn antibody. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were identified by immunoblotting with an antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, 4G10 (anti-Tyr(P)). As shown in Fig.2, proteins in lysates of CTLL-2 cells in G0 phase (lanes 1, 4, 7, and10), lysates of IL-2-treated cells (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12), and lysates of cells incubated with IL-2 in the presence of Man5GlcNAc2Asn (lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak1 (lanes 1–3), anti-Jak3 (lanes 4–6), anti-Lck (lanes 7–9), and anti-Lyn antibody (lanes 10–12). The levels of phosphorylated Jak1, Jak3, Lck, and Lyn, which were detected by the phosphotyrosine-specific 4G10 antibody, were increased in IL-2-induced cells (lanes 3, 6, 9, and12) as compared with cells in G0 phase (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10). In contrast, phosphorylation of these tyrosine kinases in cells stimulated with IL-2 in the presence of Man5GlcNAc2Asn was exclusively reduced (lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11). These results indicate that the carbohydrate recognition function of IL-2 modulates signal transduction through Jak1, Jak3, Lck, and Lyn linked to IL-2 receptor subunits β and γ. The results described above indicated that the carbohydrate recognition function of IL-2 was involved in the cellular signaling system. Although it is known that IL-2 induces the formation of an IL-2·IL-2 receptor complex which includes the three receptor subunits α, β, and γ (IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ) (3Nelson B.H. Willerford D.M. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the soluble IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ independently show low affinity binding to IL-2. That is, the α-subunit binds IL-2 with low affinity (K d ∼ 10 nm), the β-subunit binds IL-2 with very low affinity (K d ∼ 100 nm), and the γ-subunit has no measurable affinity for IL-2 (8Arima N. Kamio M. Imada K. Hori T. Hattori T. Tsudo M. Okuma M. Uchiyama T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9Takeshita T. Ohtani K. Asao H. Kumaki S. Nakamura M.

However, as soon as IL-2 forms the high affinity complex with the IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ subunits, cellular signaling is triggered. If a lectin-like interaction between IL-2 and a specific glycoprotein is the trigger for formation of the high-affinity receptor complex, a specific glycoprotein having Man5–6GlcNAc2 should be co-immunoprecipitated with the IL-2 receptor complex in the lysates of IL-2-stimulated CTLL-2 cells using antibody against the IL-2Rα, -β, or -γ subunit. To detect such a glycoprotein containing Man5–6GlcNAc2 in these immunoprecipitates, we used G. nivalis agglutinin which specifically recognizes high-mannose type glycans (14Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 728-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CTLL-2 cells (1 × 107cells/lane) which had been continuously cultured in the presence of IL-2 were solubilized with the lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40, the proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-IL-2Rα, anti-IL-2Rβ, or anti-IL-2Rγ antibody, and each of the immunoprecipitates was fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% acrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then treated with anti-IL-2Rα, anti-IL-2Rβ, anti-IL-2Rγ, anti-Lck, anti-Lyn, anti-Jak1, or anti-Jak3 antibody. Although antibody against each subunit of IL-2R was used for immunoprecipitation, all immunoprecipitates showed a 55-kDa band corresponding to IL-2Rα upon staining with anti-IL-2Rα, a 75-kDa band corresponding to IL-2Rβ upon staining with anti-IL-2Rβ, a 64-kDa band corresponding to IL-2Rγ upon staining with anti-IL-2Rγ, a 56-kDa band corresponding to Lck upon staining with anti-Lck, a 115-kDa band corresponding to Jak1 upon staining with anti-Jak1 kinase, a 115-kDa band corresponding to Jak3 upon staining with anti-Jak3, and a 56-kDa band corresponding to Lyn upon staining with anti-Lyn antibody (3Nelson B.H. Willerford D.M. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A). These results indicated that all of the immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-IL-2Rα, -β, or -γ antibody in analysis of CTLL-2 cells exposed to IL-2 consisted of the IL-2R complex which at least included IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ, and the kinases Lck, Lyn, Jak1, and Jak3. In contrast, this complex could not be observed in CTLL-2 cells incubated in the absence of IL-2 (data not shown). In view of these results, after the immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ had been fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% acrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, the membranes were stained with biotinylated GNA which rather specifically recognizes Man5GlcNAc2Asn (14Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. J. Biol.

Since only a single 55-kDa band corresponding to the IL-2Rα subunit was stained in each instance, the membranes were reprobed with anti-IL-2Rα subunit antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 B, a protein band in the same position as the GNA-stained protein band was positively stained with anti-IL-2Rα subunit antibody. Furthermore, although only the IL-2Rα subunit was immunoprecipitated with anti-IL-2Rα subunit antibody in the case of CTLL-2 cells incubated in the absence of IL-2, the same constituent of the immunoprecipitate was positively stained with GNA (data not shown). When each blot was treated with Endo H (Fig. 3, lane 11) or Endo D (Fig. 3,lane 12), the band positively stained with GNA (Fig. 3,lane 10) was diminished to 3% (Endo H) or 15% (Endo D), calculated on the basis of the intensity of chemiluminescence (Fig.3 C). Since Endo H hydrolyzes high-mannose type glycans including Man4–9GlcNAc2 and hybrid-type glycans (23Tai T. Yamashita K. Kobata A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas Endo D hydrolyzes Man3–5GlcNAc2 (15Tai T. Yamashita K. Ogata-Arakawa M. Koide N. Muramatsu T. Iwashita S. Inoue Y.

These results suggest that only the IL-2Rα subunit has the high-mannose type glycan with Man5GlcNAc2, among the components of the IL-2R complex in CTLL-2 cells, and that IL-2 bifunctionally binds a high-mannose type glycan and a specific peptide sequence of IL-2Rα, although all of the subunits of IL-2R have several potentialN-glycosylation sites (25Shimizu A. Kondo S. Takeda S.-I. Yodoi J. Ishida N. Sabe H. Osawa H. Diamantstein T. Nikaido T. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1505-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Kono T. Doi T.

Since the nonglycosylated rhIL-2Rα subunit recognizes Lys35, Lys38, Thr42, and Lys43 residues in IL-2 (28Sauve K. Nachman M. Spence C. Bailon P. Campbell E. Tsien W.H. Kondas J.A. Hakimi J. Ju G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4636-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), another peptide sequence of IL-2 may bind a high-mannose type glycan with Man5GlcNAc2 which is linked to Asn33, Asn43, or Asn200 of mouse IL-2Rα (25Shimizu A. Kondo S. Takeda S.-I. Yodoi J. Ishida N. Sabe H. Osawa H. Diamantstein T. Nikaido T. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1505-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As soon as IL-2 bifunctionally binds to the IL-2Rα subunit, formation of the IL-2·IL-2Rα complex might occur resulting in a change in conformation of IL-2 which increases the accessibility to the IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ subunits. This high-affinity complex of IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, and IL-2Rγ subunits may stimulate cellular signaling through tyrosine kinases including Jak1, Jak3, Lck, and Lyn. Our findings presented in this paper clearly demonstrate that the dual recognition by IL-2 of a specific peptide sequence and a carbohydrate epitope in the IL-2Rα molecule is required to trigger the formation of a high-affinity complex of IL-2-IL-2Rα, -β, -γ, and that Man5GlcNAc2Asn or Man6GlcNAc2Asn in the medium inhibits not only IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 proliferation but also tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1, Jak3, Lck, and Lyn. Furthermore, the IL-2-IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ complex immunoprecipitated with anti-IL-2Rα, -β, or -γ antibody contains GNA-stainable IL-2Rα, suggesting that bifunctional binding of IL-2 to Man5GlcNAc2 and a specific peptide sequence in the IL-2Rα molecule immediately leads to formation of the high-affinity complex of IL-2-IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ, which subsequently induces tyrosine phosphorylation of IL-2Rβ and γ linked to Jak1, Jak3, Lck, and Lyn. Our results indicate that IL-2Rα is a candidate glycoprotein for IL-2 lectin-like binding in vivo, and as soon as the tetramer including IL-2-IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ is tightly formed, the tyrosine kinases linked to intracellular domains of IL-2Rβ and -γ are immediately phosphorylated and induce cellular signaling. On the basis of the results described, we propose a tentative schematic model as shown in Fig. 4, although the binding site of Lyn has not been determined to be the IL-2Rβ or -γ subunit. In our investigation of the inhibitory effects of Man5GlcNAc2Asn and Man6GlcNAc2Asn on IL-2-dependent cell proliferation, the 2-h preincubation time before addition of the mixture to the cells was found to be critical and exogenous Man5GlcNAc2Asn added to the mixture could not replace the glycan bound to IL-2. As soon as the high-mannose type glycan linked to the extracellular domain of the IL-2Rα subunit binds to IL-2, it seems that IL-2 binds a specific region of the IL-2Rα subunit and this dual recognition is too strong to be replaced by exogenous Man5GlcNAc2Asn. On the basis of the experimental results, we speculate that the conformation of carbohydrate-bound IL-2 may immediately change to fit with a specific peptide sequence in IL-2Rα and formation of the IL-2·IL-2Rα complex may be a trigger to form the high-affinity complex which consists of all constituents required for the cell signaling to occur. This may be the reason why large amounts of exogenous Man5GlcNAc2Asn cannot substitute for the endogenous glycoprotein, and why inhibitory effects of oligomannosides on the T-cell proliferative response to IL-2 have not been reported until today. To our knowledge, this is the first report to directly demonstrate that carbohydrate recognition activity is essential for stimulation of IL-2-dependent T-cell proliferation and cellular signaling. Anyway, it indicates that IL-2 bifunctionally recognizes both a high-mannose type glycan and a specific peptide sequence in IL-2Rα, and the sequential binding to IL-2Rβ and -γ subunits is necessary for expression of IL-2-induced cellular signal transduction. Similar dual recognition of protein and carbohydrate epitopes has been reported in the case of several proteins. P-selectin is one of the members of the selectin family which can mediate the initial rolling interaction between leukocytes and vascular endothelium. As all members of the selectin family can bind to related fucosylated or sialylated tetrasaccharide structures, such as sialyl-Lewisx or sialyl-Lewisa, P-selectin can bind to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 which has sialyl Lewisx-type structures on the O-linked glycan (29Foxall C. Watson S.R. Dowbenko D. Fennie C. Lasky L.A. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Asa D. Brandley B.K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Additionally, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1-P-selectin binding requires the sulfotyrosine residues located within the region consisting of the first 19 amino acids, although E-selectin can bind to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 without the sulfotyrosine residues (30Sako D.

Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Specific glycosyltransferases need to bind not only carbohydrate epitopes but also a specific peptide sequence, as follows. For example, UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzymeN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase is indispensable for the biosynthesis of phosphomannosyl residues on lysosomal enzymes which mediate their binding to mannose 6-phosphate receptors and which mediate targeting to an endosomal compartment where the hydrolases are subsequently packaged into lysosomes. Selective transfer ofN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate to mannose residues on lysosomal enzymes by this enzyme involves the dual recognition of mannosyl residues and the carboxyl lobe of the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D which is shared among lysosomal hydrolases (32Baranski T.J. Cantor A.B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23342-23348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GalNAc transferase, responsible for the formation of SO4-GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Man on the glycoprotein hormones lutropin and thyrotropin, etc., recognizes bothN-acetylglucosaminyl residues and the peptide motif Pro-Xaa-(Arg/Lys) present in each of these glycoproteins (33Dharmesh S.M. Skelton T.P. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17096-17102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These reports suggest that these are members of an emerging family of binding proteins with specificity for both protein and carbohydrate epitopes. On the basis of the mechanisms of carbohydrate recognition involved, cytokines have been grouped into three types to date. It has been determined that growth factors including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (34Gordon M.Y. Riley G.P. Watt S.M. Greaves M.F. Nature. 1987; 326: 403-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and bovine fibroblast growth factor (35Bashkin P. Doctrow S. Klagsbrun M. Svahn C. Folkman J. Vlodavsky I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) recognize glycosaminoglycans, interleukin-1β binds the mannose 6-phosphodiester in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein (36Fukushima K. Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Ideo H. Inazu T. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10579-10584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and IL-2 recognizes high-mannose type glycans. However, whether other cytokines have strict carbohydrate recognition ability should be more precisely investigated. Cytokines have not been reported to have a common carbohydrate recognition domain. However, IL-2 has a limited degree of sequence homology in the amino-terminal portion compared with the COOH-terminal domains of three C-type mannose binding lectins (11Sherblom A.P. Sathyamoorthy N. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 939-944PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, since we found that at least one of the conserved amino acid residues was involved in carbohydrate recognition by IL-2, the further confirmation will be required in the near future. Zanetta et al. (12Zanetta J.-P. Alonso C. Michalski J.-C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) previously reported that IL-2 binds a glycosylated CD3 of TCR which is linked to the Lck kinase in human peripheral lymphocytes. However, we could not find any TCR αβ subunit when we immunostained the IL-2-IL-2Rα, -β, -γ, Lck, Lyn, Jak1, and Jak3 complex, which was immunoprecipitated with anti-IL-2Rα, -β, or -γ antibody in lysates of CTLL-2 cells exposed to IL-2, using anti-TCR αβ subunit antibody (data not shown). In contrast, the immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-TCR αβ subunit antibody from lysates of CTLL-2 cells exposed to IL-2 did not include any IL-2Rα, -β, or -γ as determined by immunostaining (data not shown). These results also support the view that the IL-2Rα subunit itself is a glycoprotein containing the carbohydrate recognition site of IL-2 in murine CTLL-2 cells. Which of the three N-glycosylation sites in murine IL-2Rα has the carbohydrate to which IL-2 binds will be determined in the near future. We are further investigating whether IL-2 has another carbohydrate recognition mechanism as proposed by Zanetta et al. (12Zanetta J.-P. Alonso C. Michalski J.-C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in the case of human peripheral lymphocytes and whether the human IL-2Rα subunit has high-mannose type N-glycans to which IL-2 can bind.

We use a progressive model of neoplasia based on several mouse epithelial cell lines that represent distinct steps toward the fully tumorigenic state. Using RNase protection analysis because acceptable anti-Brca1 antibodies are not available we investigated the expression of Brca1 and a splice variant, Brca1Delta11, in several mammary hyperplasias and tumors that arose from them, and in normal mammary gland through pregnancy and involution. Expression of Brca1 was highest in rapidly proliferating cells. Expression of the full-length Brca1 was detectable in the virgin gland, was slightly elevated in the midpregnant gland, and decreased to levels similar to the age-matched virgin gland in the completely involuted gland. Expression of both forms of Brca1 was detectable in 9/9 paired hyperplasias and tumors, with levels of total Brca1, but not the splice variant Brca1Delta11, in tumors higher than those in the hyperplasias. While in disagreement with the observation that Brca1 levels decrease in human breast cancer progression, these patterns support the notion that Brca1 expression is associated with proliferating cells, and suggests that the link with differentiation seen in normal cells can be removed when cells become tumorigenic."

To identify post-transcriptional regulators of rbc L expression, three types of analyses (polysome heel printing, gel retardation, and UV cross-linking) were utilized. These approaches revealed that multiple proteins interact with 5′ regions ofrbc L mRNA in light-grown, but not etiolated, amaranth plants. Light-associated binding of a 47-kDa protein (p47), observed by UV cross-linking, was highly specific for the rbc L 5′ RNA. Binding of p47 occurred only with RNAs corresponding to mature processed rbc L transcripts (5′-untranslated region (UTR) terminating at −66); transcripts with longer 5′-UTRs did not associate with p47 in vitro. Variations in the length of therb cL 5′-UTR were found to occur in vivo, and these different 5′ termini may prevent or enhance light-associated p47 binding, possibly affecting rbc L expression as well. p47 binding correlates with light-dependent rb cL polysome association of the fully processed transcripts in photosynthetic leaves and cotyledons but not with cell-specificrbc L mRNA accumulation in bundle sheath and mesophyll chloroplasts."

Being constituted by a run of thymidine residues on the coding strand (a poly(dA) tract on the transcribed strand), pol III terminators are expected to form highly stable triple-helix complexes with oligothymine peptide nucleic acids (PNAs). We analyzed the effect of a T10 PNA onin vitro transcription of three yeast class III genes (coding for two different tRNAs and the U6 small nuclear RNA) having termination signals of at least ten T residues. At nanomolar concentrations, the PNA almost completely inhibited transcription of supercoiled, but not linearized, templates in a sequence-specific manner. The total RNA output of the first transcription cycle was not affected by PNA concentrations strongly inhibiting multiple round transcription. Thus, an impairment of pol III recycling fully accounts for the observed inhibition.

TFIIIA (a 5 S-specific component) and TFIIIC are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that recognize the internal control regions of class III genes. Once bound, they direct the assembly of TFIIIB upstream to the transcription start site; TFIIIB then recruits pol III and actively participates in the transcription initiation step (1Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek P.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 2Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9196-9201Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To satisfy the high cellular need for its RNA products, the pol III transcription machinery maximizes the efficiency of reinitiation in two ways: once formed, a functional preinitiation complex is stably maintained at the promoter for multiple rounds of pol III recruitment by the initiation factor TFIIIB (1Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek P.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar); in addition, a promoter-engaged polymerase initiates new transcription cycles more rapidly than the first one by means of a terminator-dependent, fast recycling pathway (3Dieci G. Sentenac A. Cell. 1996; 84: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The terminator of pol III-transcribed genes, generally a run of 5 or more thymidine residues on the coding strand, can thus be viewed as a key promoter element that, by allowing pol III to enter a facilitated initiation pathway, greatly increases the overall transcription output. Shortening or deleting the terminator element causes a transcription impairment due to pol III readthrough (4Allison D.S. Hall B.D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2657-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and also precludes the entrapment of terminating pol III molecules for structural and functional studies. Therefore, a nondestructive approach, such as the protein roadblock strategy utilized for Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (5Nudler E. Kashlev M. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1995; 81: 351-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), has to be used for the functional dissection of the coupled termination/reinitiation processes. Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), recently developed nucleic acid mimics in which the nucleobases are attached to a pseudopeptide backbone, can form extremely stable complexes with complementary RNA and DNA targets and have thus the potential to interfere with key steps of gene expression (6Nielsen P.E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In particular, oligopyrimidine PNAs bind with high affinity to double-stranded DNA targets through a strand displacement mechanism, in which two invading PNAs form a Watson-Crick-Hogsteen triple-helix with the complementary DNA strand, leaving the other strand unpaired (7Nielsen P.E. Egholm M. Buchardt O. J. Mol. Recognit. 1994; 7: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The potential of oligopyrimidine PNAs for gene-targeting strategies has originally been documented in studies demonstrating the PNA-dependent arrest of transcription elongation by phage RNA polymerases and human RNA polymerase II on artiïficial DNA templates bearing an oligopurine cassette on the transcribed strand (8Hanvey J.C. Peffer N.J. Bisi J.E. Thomson S.A. Cadilla R. Josey J.A. Ricca D.J. Hassman C.F. Bonham M.A. Au K.G. Carter S.G. Bruckenstein D.A. Boyd A.L. Noble S.A. Babiss L.E.

We reasoned that the poly(dA) tract present on the transcribed strand of class III gene terminators represents a unique natural case of a widespread eukaryotic control element that can be targeted by oligothymine PNA molecules. To gain insight into the structural and functional features of a late elongating pol III and to lay the grounds for a detailed understanding of the anti-gene properties of PNAs, we thus set out to analyze the transcriptional effect of a terminator-bound oligothymine PNA in a well-defined in vitropol III system from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.DISCUSSIONThis report provides an in-depth account of the mode of action of a DNA-binding drug specifically targeting the transcriptional terminators of eukaryotic class III genes. Our analysis utilized a highly purified RNA polymerase III transcription system from S. cerevisiae in which reinitiation, relying on a facilitated pol III-recycling mechanism, takes place at high efficiency. Central to this process is a T-rich terminator element, which by an as yet unidentified mechanism allows a terminating pol III to efficiently reinitiate by bypassing the slow, de novo enzyme recruitment step (3Dieci G. Sentenac A. Cell. 1996; 84: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Targeting the complementary poly(dA) tract of the class III gene terminator with an oligothymine PNA resulted in the formation of a stable (PNA)2-DNA adduct acting as a sequence-specific roadblock for elongating pol III. We found that a terminator-located PNA roadblock exerted two main effects on class III gene transcription. The first one is a dramatic reduction in overall transcription efficiency, due to the fact that pol III molecules get stuck during the first transcription cycle, with the consequent loss of pol III recycling. The second, somewhat unexpected effect is the blockage of transcribing pol III well ahead of the PNA roadblock, as revealed by the fact that the PNA-arrested ternary complex contains an unreleased RNA that, depending on the template, is 15–25 nt shorter than the full-length transcript and does not result from pol III-catalyzed hydrolysis of a longer precursor. This suggests that the polymerization site of a transcribing pol III lies 10–20 bp ahead of the leading edge of the enzyme that first senses the upstream border of the PNA-DNA adduct (see Fig. 5 C). This distance is larger than that observed in previous studies employing either phage T3 and T7 RNA polymerases (10Nielsen P.E. Egholm M. Buchardt O. Gene. 1994; 149: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or human RNA polymerase II (8Hanvey J.C. Peffer N.J. Bisi J.E. Thomson S.A. Cadilla R. Josey J.A. Ricca D.J. Hassman C.F. Bonham M.A. Au K.G. Carter S.G. Bruckenstein D.A. Boyd A.L. Noble S.A. Babiss L.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In these studies, in which artificial templates containing a dA10·dT10 cassette were transcribed in the presence of a T10 PNA, elongation became arrested at the very upstream border of the PNA-binding site. Although the discrepancy between pol III and phage RNA polymerases can be explained by the much larger size of the eukaryotic enzyme, the lack of an earlier arrest in the case of pol II is more difficult to reconcile with our data. The possibility that TFIIIC, bound to the intragenic B-block, might cooperate with a terminator-bound PNA in inducing premature pol III arrest seems to be ruled out by the fact that an early blockage of transcription also occurred in the case of the SNR6 gene, in which the B-block is extragenically positioned 120 bp downstream of the terminator. Also, incomplete transcripts of the same size were produced in PNA-inhibited transcription reactions carried out in the presence or absence of TFIIIC on the tRNAIle gene (data not shown (16Dieci G. Percudani R. Giuliodori S. Bottarelli L. Ottonello S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). A more likely explanation of the observed early blockage of transcription is that, in the context of the sequence surrounding its termination site, pol III has an extended conformation that is especially sensitive to the presence of a downstream roadblock. Indeed, exonuclease III protection studies conducted on RNA polymerase II arrested at different positions along the template have shown that the active site to leading edge distance can vary from 7 to 20 bp depending on the DNA sequence context of individual positions (28Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The range of these distances is close to what we found with PNA-arrested pol III, and the variation in transcript shortening observed with different class III genes may similarly reflect sequence-dependent changes in the pol III active site to leading edge distance. Noticeably, a DNA occupancy of about 40 bp has been reported for yeast pol III having transcribed through the first 17 bp of theSUP4 tRNA gene (29Bartholomew B. Durkovich D. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), a space length that is fully compatible with an active site to leading edge distance of ∼20 bp. The effect of a protein roadblock on RNA polymerase elongation and termination has previously been studied by placing either the bacterial lacrepressor (30Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H. Proc. Natl.

The EcoRI roadblock has been shown to efficiently arrest both elongating and terminating E. coli RNA polymerases, and a detailed analysis of the arrested complexes has suggested a model in which the leading edge of the transcribing polymerase precedes by 7–9 bp the site at which polymerization occurs (34Pavco P.A.

More consistent with our observations, studies of bacterial RNA polymerase blockage by a psoralen diadduct have shown that the leading edge of the enzyme can extend further downstream, being separated by as much as 18–20 bp from the growing point of the RNA chain (35Shi Y.B. Gamper H. Van Houten B. Hearst J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The T10 PNA very effectively inhibited transcription of various class III genes with a half-inhibitory concentration (100 nm) 5- to 10-fold lower than that previously determined for phage (10Nielsen P.E. Egholm M. Buchardt O. Gene. 1994; 149: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and human RNA polymerases (8Hanvey J.C. Peffer N.J. Bisi J.E. Thomson S.A. Cadilla R. Josey J.A. Ricca D.J. Hassman C.F. Bonham M.A. Au K.G. Carter S.G. Bruckenstein D.A. Boyd A.L. Noble S.A. Babiss L.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). This difference is likely due to the negatively supercoiled state of the templates utilized for our pol III experiments, because we observed a 10-fold increase of the PNA half-inhibitory concentration upon linearization of the tDNAIle-containing plasmid. By influencing the dynamics of base pair breathing, DNA supercoiling enhances PNA binding (19Bentin T. Nielsen P.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8863-8869Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), a most important effect in view of the possible in vivo use of PNAs as negative modulators of chromatin-assembled (i.e.supercoiled) target genes. Because the pol III transcription machinery, unlike pol I and pol II, efficiently terminates and reinitiatesin vitro on supercoiled templates, it lends itself as the most sensitive and biochemically appropriate system for studying the anti-transcriptional activity of PNAs.The possibility of controlling eukaryotic gene transcription with small effector molecules has important pharmacological implications. Several studies have recently demonstrated the transcriptional inhibition of specific genes in vitro and in vivo by triple-helix forming oligonucleotides (36Praseuth D. Guieysse A.L. Hélène C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3003-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In all of these studies, DNA ligands were designed so as to target specific sequences either involved in transcription initiation, thereby inhibiting transcription complex assembly, or located in the middle of a transcriptional unit to block transcription elongation. Our present findings extend the above results by showing that targeting a well-conserved control element at the end of class III transcriptional units also causes an elongation arrest. Eukaryotic genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III, especially the tRNA and the 5 S rRNA genes, are novel potential targets of anti-gene strategies. In fact, because of their key roles in protein biosynthesis, the products of these genes are essential for cell proliferation, and their deregulation in neoplastic cells has been proposed to contribute to the loss of cell growth control that accompanies tumor formation (44White R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 77-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The present demonstration that oligothymine PNAs strongly and specifically inhibit pol III transcription thus sets the ground for future studies aimed to optimize the in vivo exploitation of these class III terminator ligands for pharmacological purposes. High throughput transcription of eukaryotic genes encoding small RNAs involved in protein synthesis (i.e. the tRNAs and the 5 S rRNA) is one of the main tasks of RNA polymerase III (pol III)1 and its associated factors (TFIIIA, TFIIIC, and TFIIIB). TFIIIA (a 5 S-specific component) and TFIIIC are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that recognize the internal control regions of class III genes. Once bound, they direct the assembly of TFIIIB upstream to the transcription start site; TFIIIB then recruits pol III and actively participates in the transcription initiation step (1Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek P.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 2Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9196-9201Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To satisfy the high cellular need for its RNA products, the pol III transcription machinery maximizes the efficiency of reinitiation in two ways: once formed, a functional preinitiation complex is stably maintained at the promoter for multiple rounds of pol III recruitment by the initiation factor TFIIIB (1Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek P.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar); in addition, a promoter-engaged polymerase initiates new transcription cycles more rapidly than the first one by means of a terminator-dependent, fast recycling pathway (3Dieci G. Sentenac A. Cell. 1996; 84: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The terminator of pol III-transcribed genes, generally a run of 5 or more thymidine residues on the coding strand, can thus be viewed as a key promoter element that, by allowing pol III to enter a facilitated initiation pathway, greatly increases the overall transcription output. Shortening or deleting the terminator element causes a transcription impairment due to pol III readthrough (4Allison D.S. Hall B.D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2657-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and also precludes the entrapment of terminating pol III molecules for structural and functional studies. Therefore, a nondestructive approach, such as the protein roadblock strategy utilized for Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (5Nudler E. Kashlev M. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1995; 81: 351-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), has to be used for the functional dissection of the coupled termination/reinitiation processes. Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), recently developed nucleic acid mimics in which the nucleobases are attached to a pseudopeptide backbone, can form extremely stable complexes with complementary RNA and DNA targets and have thus the potential to interfere with key steps of gene expression (6Nielsen P.E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In particular, oligopyrimidine PNAs bind with high affinity to double-stranded DNA targets through a strand displacement mechanism, in which two invading PNAs form a Watson-Crick-Hogsteen triple-helix with the complementary DNA strand, leaving the other strand unpaired (7Nielsen P.E. Egholm M. Buchardt O. J. Mol. Recognit. 1994; 7: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The potential of oligopyrimidine PNAs for gene-targeting strategies has originally been documented in studies demonstrating the PNA-dependent arrest of transcription elongation by phage RNA polymerases and human RNA polymerase II on artiïficial DNA templates bearing an oligopurine cassette on the transcribed strand (8Hanvey J.C. Peffer N.J. Bisi J.E. Thomson S.A. Cadilla R. Josey J.A. Ricca D.J. Hassman C.F. Bonham M.A. Au K.G. Carter S.G. Bruckenstein D.A. Boyd A.L. Noble S.A. Babiss L.E.

We reasoned that the poly(dA) tract present on the transcribed strand of class III gene terminators represents a unique natural case of a widespread eukaryotic control element that can be targeted by oligothymine PNA molecules. To gain insight into the structural and functional features of a late elongating pol III and to lay the grounds for a detailed understanding of the anti-gene properties of PNAs, we thus set out to analyze the transcriptional effect of a terminator-bound oligothymine PNA in a well-defined in vitropol III system from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DISCUSSIONThis report provides an in-depth account of the mode of action of a DNA-binding drug specifically targeting the transcriptional terminators of eukaryotic class III genes. Our analysis utilized a highly purified RNA polymerase III transcription system from S. cerevisiae in which reinitiation, relying on a facilitated pol III-recycling mechanism, takes place at high efficiency. Central to this process is a T-rich terminator element, which by an as yet unidentified mechanism allows a terminating pol III to efficiently reinitiate by bypassing the slow, de novo enzyme recruitment step (3Dieci G. Sentenac A. Cell. 1996; 84: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Targeting the complementary poly(dA) tract of the class III gene terminator with an oligothymine PNA resulted in the formation of a stable (PNA)2-DNA adduct acting as a sequence-specific roadblock for elongating pol III. We found that a terminator-located PNA roadblock exerted two main effects on class III gene transcription. The first one is a dramatic reduction in overall transcription efficiency, due to the fact that pol III molecules get stuck during the first transcription cycle, with the consequent loss of pol III recycling. The second, somewhat unexpected effect is the blockage of transcribing pol III well ahead of the PNA roadblock, as revealed by the fact that the PNA-arrested ternary complex contains an unreleased RNA that, depending on the template, is 15–25 nt shorter than the full-length transcript and does not result from pol III-catalyzed hydrolysis of a longer precursor. This suggests that the polymerization site of a transcribing pol III lies 10–20 bp ahead of the leading edge of the enzyme that first senses the upstream border of the PNA-DNA adduct (see Fig. 5 C). This distance is larger than that observed in previous studies employing either phage T3 and T7 RNA polymerases (10Nielsen P.E. Egholm M. Buchardt O. Gene. 1994; 149: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or human RNA polymerase II (8Hanvey J.C. Peffer N.J. Bisi J.E. Thomson S.A. Cadilla R. Josey J.A. Ricca D.J. Hassman C.F. Bonham M.A. Au K.G. Carter S.G. Bruckenstein D.A. Boyd A.L. Noble S.A. Babiss L.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In these studies, in which artificial templates containing a dA10·dT10 cassette were transcribed in the presence of a T10 PNA, elongation became arrested at the very upstream border of the PNA-binding site. Although the discrepancy between pol III and phage RNA polymerases can be explained by the much larger size of the eukaryotic enzyme, the lack of an earlier arrest in the case of pol II is more difficult to reconcile with our data. The possibility that TFIIIC, bound to the intragenic B-block, might cooperate with a terminator-bound PNA in inducing premature pol III arrest seems to be ruled out by the fact that an early blockage of transcription also occurred in the case of the SNR6 gene, in which the B-block is extragenically positioned 120 bp downstream of the terminator. Also, incomplete transcripts of the same size were produced in PNA-inhibited transcription reactions carried out in the presence or absence of TFIIIC on the tRNAIle gene (data not shown (16Dieci G. Percudani R. Giuliodori S. Bottarelli L. Ottonello S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). A more likely explanation of the observed early blockage of transcription is that, in the context of the sequence surrounding its termination site, pol III has an extended conformation that is especially sensitive to the presence of a downstream roadblock. Indeed, exonuclease III protection studies conducted on RNA polymerase II arrested at different positions along the template have shown that the active site to leading edge distance can vary from 7 to 20 bp depending on the DNA sequence context of individual positions (28Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The range of these distances is close to what we found with PNA-arrested pol III, and the variation in transcript shortening observed with different class III genes may similarly reflect sequence-dependent changes in the pol III active site to leading edge distance. Noticeably, a DNA occupancy of about 40 bp has been reported for yeast pol III having transcribed through the first 17 bp of theSUP4 tRNA gene (29Bartholomew B. Durkovich D. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), a space length that is fully compatible with an active site to leading edge distance of ∼20 bp. The effect of a protein roadblock on RNA polymerase elongation and termination has previously been studied by placing either the bacterial lacrepressor (30Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4134-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Deuschle U. Hipskind R.A. Bujard H.

By influencing the dynamics of base pair breathing, DNA supercoiling enhances PNA binding (19Bentin T. Nielsen P.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8863-8869Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), a most important effect in view of the possible in vivo use of PNAs as negative modulators of chromatin-assembled (i.e.supercoiled) target genes. Because the pol III transcription machinery, unlike pol I and pol II, efficiently terminates and reinitiatesin vitro on supercoiled templates, it lends itself as the most sensitive and biochemically appropriate system for studying the anti-transcriptional activity of PNAs. The possibility of controlling eukaryotic gene transcription with small effector molecules has important pharmacological implications. Several studies have recently demonstrated the transcriptional inhibition of specific genes in vitro and in vivo by triple-helix forming oligonucleotides (36Praseuth D. Guieysse A.L. Hélène C.

In all of these studies, DNA ligands were designed so as to target specific sequences either involved in transcription initiation, thereby inhibiting transcription complex assembly, or located in the middle of a transcriptional unit to block transcription elongation. Our present findings extend the above results by showing that targeting a well-conserved control element at the end of class III transcriptional units also causes an elongation arrest. Eukaryotic genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III, especially the tRNA and the 5 S rRNA genes, are novel potential targets of anti-gene strategies. In fact, because of their key roles in protein biosynthesis, the products of these genes are essential for cell proliferation, and their deregulation in neoplastic cells has been proposed to contribute to the loss of cell growth control that accompanies tumor formation (44White R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 77-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The present demonstration that oligothymine PNAs strongly and specifically inhibit pol III transcription thus sets the ground for future studies aimed to optimize the in vivo exploitation of these class III terminator ligands for pharmacological purposes. We are grateful to Christophe Carles and Emmanuel Favry for the gift of purified RNA polymerase III, and to Claudio Rivetti for helpful suggestions and comments on the manuscript. Encouragement and support from Gian Luigi Rossi are also gratefully acknowledged."
https://openalex.org/W2019567497,"High resolution structural studies of models of glutamate receptors (GluRs) have been limited to monomeric models of the ligand-binding site. To obtain oligomeric models of glutamate receptors that can reveal more complete structural information, we examined the assembly and ligand binding properties of two truncated versions of the GluR1 subunit. The first version, GluR1-WS, consisted of only the N-terminal extracellular segment (Ala<sup>1</sup>–Glu<sup>520</sup>) bridged by a synthetic linker to the second extracellular domain (Asn<sup>615</sup>–Gly<sup>790</sup>). The second version, GluR1-M1, consisted of the first N-terminal extracellular domain (Ala<sup>1</sup>–Glu<sup>520</sup>) bridged by a synthetic linker to a second segment containing the second extracellular domain, the third transmembrane domain, and the intracellular C-terminal domain (Asn<sup>615</sup>–Leu<sup>889</sup>). When expressed in<i>Xenopus</i> oocytes, GluR-WS was secreted and water-soluble; GluR1-M1 was displayed on the surface of oocytes. GluR1-WS exhibited a velocity sedimentation profile that was consistent with assembly of homooligomers and bound the glutamate receptor agonist α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid with high affinity. These findings show that the extracellular domains of GluR1 that are sufficient for ligand binding apparently are sufficient for subunit assembly and might be a suitable target for structural studies of a water-soluble GluR1 oligomer."
