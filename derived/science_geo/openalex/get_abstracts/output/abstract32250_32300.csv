https://openalex.org/W2039599894,"Overlapping complementary DNA clones were isolated from epithelial cell libraries with a genomic DNA segment containing a portion of the putative cystic fibrosis (CF) locus, which is on chromosome 7. Transcripts, approximately 6500 nucleotides in size, were detectable in the tissues affected in patients with CF. The predicted protein consists of two similar motifs, each with (i) a domain having properties consistent with membrane association and (ii) a domain believed to be involved in ATP (adenosine triphosphate) binding. A deletion of three base pairs that results in the omission of a phenylalanine residue at the center of the first predicted nucleotide-binding domain was detected in CF patients."

https://openalex.org/W2069333165,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces the synthesis of protein(s) that can protect cells against subsequent killing by TNF in the presence of cycloheximide. Here we demonstrate that manganous superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the scavenging of superoxide radicals (O2-), is such a protein. Overexpression of MnSOD confers increased resistance to TNF plus cycloheximide on the 293 human embryonic kidney cell line. Conversely, expression of antisense MnSOD RNA renders these cells sensitive to TNF even in the absence of cycloheximide. The TNF sensitivity of the ME-180 human cervical carcinoma cell line can also be modulated through expression of sense and antisense MnSOD RNAs. These data identify MnSOD as an important determinant of cellular resistance to TNF and implicate mitochondrially generated O2- as a key component of TNF-mediated tumor cell killing."

https://openalex.org/W2087538693,"During the development of the nervous system, growing axons must traverse considerable distances to find their targets. In insects, this problem is solved in part by pioneer neurons, which lay down the first axonal pathways when distances are at a minimum. Here the existence of a similar kind of neuron in the developing mammalian telencephalon is described. These are the subplate cells, the first postmitotic neurons of the cerebral cortex. Axons from subplate neurons traverse the internal capsule and invade the thalamus early in fetal life, even before the neurons of cortical layers 5 and 6, which will form the adult subcortical projections, are generated. During postnatal life, after the adult pattern of axonal projections is firmly established, most subplate neurons disappear. These observations raise the possibility that the early axonal scaffold formed by subplate cells may prove essential for the establishment of permanent subcortical projections."

https://openalex.org/W1980336356,"We have dissected the protein and nucleic acid determinants that direct a group of transcriptional antiterminators to their specific target operons. These antiterminators, the N gene products of phages lambda, 21, and P22, function solely with their respective recognition sites, nut, to modify RNA polymerase to a termination-resistant form. We demonstrate that a unique hairpin sequence within each nut site, called boxB, confers genome specificity by interacting with a small amino-terminal domain of the cognate N protein. This interaction is dependent upon an arginine-rich subdomain, which is conserved not only among the N proteins but also in many RNA binding proteins from ribosomes and RNA virus capsids. Notably, this motif constitutes an essential domain of the HIV protein Tat whose function as a trans-activator requires a specific hairpin sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2023647117,"Transgenic mice expressing a T cell receptor heterodimer specific for a fragment of pigeon cytochrome c plus an MHC class II molecule (I-Ek) have been made. We find that H-2k alpha beta transgenic mice have an overall increase in the number of T cells and express a 10-fold higher fraction of cytochrome c-reactive cells than H-2b mice. Surface staining of thymocytes indicates that in H-2b mice, T cell development is arrested at an intermediate stage of differentiation (CD4+8+, CD310). Analyses of mice carrying these T cell receptor genes and MHC class II I-E alpha constructs indicate that his developmental block can be reversed in H-2b mice by I-E expression on cortical epithelial cells of the thymus. These data suggest that a direct T cell receptor-MHC interaction occurs in the thymus in the absence of nominal antigen and results in the enhanced export of T cells, consistent with the concept of ""positive selection""."
https://openalex.org/W1972116208,"The inhibition by charybdotoxin of A-type potassium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes was studied for several splicing variants of the Drosophila Shaker gene and for several site-directed mutants of this channel. Charybdotoxin blocking affinity is lowered by a factor of 3.5 upon replacing glutamate-422 with glutamine, and by a factor of about 12 upon substituting lysine in this position. Replacement of glutamate-422 by aspartate had no effect on toxin affinity. Thus, the glutamate residue at position 422 of this potassium channel is near or in the externally facing mouth of the potassium conduction pathway, and the positively charged toxin is electrostatically focused toward its blocking site by the negative potential set up by glutamate-422."
https://openalex.org/W1487143054,"DNA-dependent DNA synthesis in vitro by human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase is relatively error-prone. The enzyme, whether recombinant or from virus particles, produces errors while replicating M13mp2 DNA at a rate that, if operative in vivo, would produce about five mutations per genome per round of replication. Sequence analysis of mutants resulting from in vitro synthesis demonstrates that errors are nonrandomly distributed. Base substitution and one-base frameshift mutational hot spots are observed. The specificity and position of errors suggest that most of the frameshifts and many of the base substitutions are initiated by template-primer slippage. Processivity analysis for the enzyme on the M13mp2 DNA template reveals strong termination at specific sites. Termination sites within homopolymer sequences correlate with frameshift mutational hot spots. The results suggest that the formation and/or utilization of misaligned template-primers is increased during the dissociation-reinitiation phase of the reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1503206906,"Abstract We have studied cyclic AMP-mediated regulation of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR). The effects of cAMP were assessed in Chinese hamster fibroblast (CHW) cells expressing either the wild type human beta 2AR receptor (CH-beta 2) or mutated forms of the receptor lacking the consensus sequences for phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Treatment of the CH-beta 2 cells with the cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) induces a time-dependent of the number of beta 2AR. This down-regulation of the receptors is accompanied by a decline in the steady state level of beta 2AR mRNA. Moreover, the treatment with Bt2cAMP induces an increase in the phosphorylation level of the membrane-associated beta 2AR. Both the reduction in beta 2AR mRNA and the enhanced phosphorylation of the receptor are rapid and precede the loss of receptor. The down-regulation of beta 2AR induced by Bt2cAMP is concentration-dependent and mimicked by the other biologically active cyclic nucleotide analogue, 8-Br-cAMP, by forskolin, and by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutylmethylxanthine. In the CHW cell lines expressing receptors lacking the putative protein kinase A phosphorylation sites, the Bt2cAMP-induced phosphorylation of beta 2AR is completely abolished. In these cells the down-regulation of beta 2AR receptor number produced by cAMP is significantly slowed, whereas the reduction in beta 2AR mRNA level is equivalent to that observed in CH-beta 2 cells. These data indicate that there are at least two pathways by which cAMP may decrease the number of beta 2ARs in cells: one involves phosphorylation of the receptor by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the other leads to a reduction in steady state beta 2AR mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W1491643288,"The conversion of testosterone into the more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone, catalyzed by the enzyme steroid 5α-reductase, is required for the differentiation of male external genitalia. Here, we report the isolation of cDNA clones encoding the rat steroid 5α-reductase using expression cloning in Xenopus oocytes. DNA sequence analysis demonstrates that the liver and ventral prostate forms of steroid 5α-reductase are identical hydrophobic proteins of 29 kDa. The amount of steroid 5α-reductase mRNA in liver increased in response to castration, but remained unchanged in the prostate. Testosterone administration to castrates induced expression of mRNA in the prostate but had no effect on liver. The data suggest that the steroid 5α-reductase gene is differentially regulated by testosterone in androgen-responsive versus non-responsive tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2067382151,"The Tar chemoreceptor of Escherichia coli is a membrane-bound sensory protein that facilitates bacterial chemotaxis in response to aspartate. The EnvZ molecule has a membrane topology similar to Tar and is a putative osmosensor that is required for osmoregulation of the genes for the major outer membrane porin proteins, OmpF and OmpC. The cytoplasmic signaling domain of Tar was replaced with the carboxyl portion of EnvZ, and the resulting chimeric receptor activated transcription of the ompC gene in response to aspartate. The activation of ompC by the chimeric receptor was absolutely dependent on OmpR, a transcriptional activator for ompF and ompC."
https://openalex.org/W1595051082,"Cells that express P-glycoprotein are resistant to many unrelated anticancer drugs. All evidence suggests that P-glycoprotein is a plasma membrane protein that confers multidrug resistance by actively transporting these cytotoxic drugs out of cells. The objective of our work is to locate drug binding sites on P-glycoprotein. Azidopine is a photoaffinity drug analog that specifically labels P-glycoprotein. To determine the region of P-glycoprotein that binds azidopine, we labeled P-glycoprotein with azidopine and digested the labeled protein into fragments. We then identified the labeled fragments with specific antibodies. We have determined that azidopine labels two different regions of P-glycoprotein: one region is in the amino half of P-glycoprotein, and the other is in the carboxyl half of the protein. Our results suggest that P-glycoprotein contains either two binding sites for azidopine or a single site formed by the two homologous halves of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1568020701,"Abstract The polypeptide chain composition of protein material referred to in the literature as was investigated. The material was found to consist of distinct proteins of 125,000 and 225,000 Da, each of which contained more than one polypeptide chain. The links that assemble each protein were found to be stable to various strong denaturants, but susceptible to treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid or hyaluronidase, indicating a glycan nature. The 225,000-Da protein migrated with inter-alpha mobility on agarose gel electrophoresis and is designated inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor, whereas the 125,000-Da protein migrated with pre-alpha mobility, and we designate it pre-alpha-trypsin inhibitor. Analysis of the proteins, the separated chains, and proteolytic derivatives thereof revealed that each protein contained a single, identical, trypsin-inhibitory chain of 30,000 Da. Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor contains noninhibitory heavy chains of 65,000 and 70,000 Da, whereas pre-alpha-trypsin inhibitor contains a heavy chain of 90,000 Da. Our data allow identification of several recently reported cDNA clones and clarify the confusion surrounding the composition of plasma proteins referred to as inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2015923819,"Intermediate filaments (IFs) of the cytokeratin (CK) type are cytoskeletal elements typical for epithelial differentiation. However, in diverse transformed culture lines of non-epithelial origin, rare cells emerge spontaneously, which synthesize, in addition to their vimentin IFs, CKs 8 and 18. We enriched such cells by cloning and studied the level(s) of regulation at which these changes occur. We found that in SV40-transformed fibroblasts the CK 18 gene is constitutively transcribed into translatable mRNA but that the protein is rapidly degraded in the absence of its complex partner, CK 8. In contrast, cells immunocytochemically positive for CK IFs contained both CKs 8 and 18, which apparently stabilized in heterotypic complexes. These findings and related observations of active genes for CKs 8 and/or 18 in several other transformed non-epithelial cell lines indicate that the genes for CKs 18 and, less frequently, 8 can be active in diverse different non-epithelial cell lines; synthesis of type I and type II CK pair partners can be uncoupled; control of CK IF formation can take place at different levels. We suggest that the intrinsic instability of the inactive state of these genes is responsible for the occurrence of CKs 8 and 18 in certain non-epithelial tissues and tumors, a caveat in tumor diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W1508062973,"The tumor-associated antigen complex, TSP-180, was previously defined in carcinoma cell lines and found to be expressed in higher amounts in tumor than in normal tissue. Here, the mouse TSP-180 complex is shown to consist of three related proteins (bands 1, 2, and 3) associated with a distinct protein (band 5) that is probably derived from a precursor protein (band 4). All of these proteins are cell surface glycoproteins, and the largest protein (band 1) can be readily labeled with 32PO4. The mouse TSP-180 complex described here strongly resembles the recently described human integrin alpha 6-beta 4 complex. This homology was confirmed using two distinct rat anti-alpha 6 monoclonal antibodies, each of which recognized both human alpha 6-beta 4 and mouse TSP-180 complexes. Furthermore, the TSP-180 band 5 protein (mouse alpha 6) had an N-terminal sequence identical to that of human alpha 6. Finally, two different monoclonal antibodies are described, 346-11A and 439-9B, which directly recognize the multiple forms of mouse and human beta 4 proteins, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2064830923,"Sera from patients with autoimmune diseases often contain antibodies that bind ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Sera from 30 such patients were found to immunoprecipitate ribonuclease P (RNase P), an RNP enzyme required to process the 5' termini of transfer RNA transcripts in nuclei and mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. All 30 sera also immunoprecipitated the nucleolar Th RNP, indicating that the two RNPs are structurally related. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Th RNP revealed it was identical to the RNA component of the mitochondrial RNA processing enzyme known as RNase MRP. Antibodies that immunoprecipitated the Th RNP selectively depleted murine and human cell extracts of RNase MRP activity, indicating that the Th and RNase MRP RNPs are identical. Since RNase P and RNase MRP are not associated with each other during biochemical purification, we suggest that these two RNA processing enzymes share a common autoantigenic polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W2024250315,"XIHbox 1 is expressed in a narrow band across the cervical region of Xenopus embryos. The gene produces two related proteins: ""long"" and ""short"" XIHbox 1 homeodomain proteins. Injection of antibodies to the long XIHbox 1 protein into 1-cell embryos caused a phenotype in which the anterior spinal cord was morphologically transformed into a hindbrain-like structure. This alteration was restricted to the region normally expressing long XIHbox 1 protein. Injection of long protein mRNA disrupted segmentation and tissue organization without inhibiting cell proliferation. Injection of short protein mRNA into 1-cell embryos produced spinal cord malformations similar, but not identical, to those caused by the antibodies, suggesting antagonistic roles for long and short XIHbox 1 proteins. We immunostained tadpoles carrying extended hindbrains for N-CAM and consistently found defective organization of spinal nerves over the affected region."
https://openalex.org/W1513685218,"Abstract The predicted cytoplasmic orientation and two-domain structure of the multidrug efflux pump P-glycoprotein were demonstrated with sequence-specific antibodies. We synthesized peptides corresponding to amino acid residues, Glu393-Lys408 (anti-P) and Leu1206-Thr1226 (anti-C) in P-glycoprotein from human mdr1 cDNA and used these peptides to produce polyclonal antibodies. From the primary structure of P-glycoprotein, and anti-C antibody is expected to recognize another position, Leu561-Thr581, in the duplicate structure of P-glycoprotein, but anti-P recognizes only one site. These antibodies bind to multidrug-resistant cells (KB-C2) with permeabilized plasma membrane but do not bind to nonpermeabilized KB-C2 cells or parental KB cells, supporting the predicted cytoplasmic orientation of these sequences. With immunoblotting of the membrane fractions from KB-C2 cells, a major 140-kDa polypeptide of the P-glycoprotein was detected with both anti-P and anti-C. Two minor polypeptides with molecular mass of 95 and 55 kDa were also detected. When membrane vesicles were digested mildly with trypsin, the amount of these two polypeptides increased. Anti-P detected only the 95-kDa polypeptide, and anti-C detected both 95- and 55-kDa polypeptides. Achromobacter lyticus protease I (lysyl endopeptidase) and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease also produced two polypeptides with similar molecular weights. Absorption into lectin-agarose beads and labeling with [3H]glucosamine indicated that the 95-kDa polypeptide was glycosylated but that the 55-kDa polypeptide was not. These two polypeptides as well as P-glycoprotein were photoaffinity-labeled with a calcium channel blocker, [3H]azidopine, but most of the label was found in the 55-kDa polypeptide. The yield of labeled fragments from membrane vesicles photolabeled after digestion with trypsin was similar to that from membrane vesicles digested with trypsin after photolabeling. These data indicate 1) that the 95-kDa polypeptide is the fragment corresponding to the amino-terminal half of P-glycoprotein containing sugar chains; 2) that the 55-kDa polypeptide is the carboxyl-terminal half which was mainly labeled with [3H]azidopine; and 3) that P-glycoprotein has a relatively rigid structure with a small number of protease-sensitive sites and its global structure is not destroyed by tryptic cleavage."

https://openalex.org/W2035199235,"The expression of proto-oncogenes representative of several functional categories has been investigated during development of mouse male germ cells. The c-raf proto-oncogene and three members of the c-ras gene family were expressed in mitotically active stem cells, throughout the prophase of meiosis and to varying extents in post-meiotic cell types. In contrast, the nuclear proto-oncogenes c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc were specifically expressed at high levels in type B spermatogonia. High levels of c-myc and c-jun RNAs were also detected in spermatocytes early in the prophase of meiosis. The type B spermatogonia represent the last mitotic cell division before entry into meiotic prophase; therefore, these nuclear proto-oncogenes may be involved in altering programs of gene expression at this developmental transition."
https://openalex.org/W1562002123,"Abstract We have isolated two overlapping cDNA clones covering 2425 base pairs encoding a short type VIII collagen chain synthesized by rabbit corneal endothelial cells. The cDNAs encode an open reading frame of 744 amino acid residues containing a triple-helical domain of 454 residues flanked by 117- and 173-residue amino and carboxyl non-triple-helical domains (called NC2 and NC1, respectively). Based on the identity between the DNA-derived amino acid sequence and the amino acid sequence of a type VIII collagen CNBr peptide obtained from rabbit corneal Descemet's membrane, we conclude that the cDNAs code for a type VIII collagen chain. We give this chain the designation alpha 1(VIII). The alpha 1(VIII) triple-helical domain contains eight imperfections in the Gly-X-Y repeated structure with Gly-X instead of a full triplet. The length of the triple-helical domain and number and relative locations of these imperfections are remarkably similar to those of chicken alpha 1(X) collagen. The amino acid sequence of the carboxyl three-quarters of the NC1 domain has high sequence similarity to that of alpha 1(X) collagen. These data suggest that the triple-helix coding portions and carboxyl three-quarters of the NC1 domains of the alpha 1(VIII) and alpha 1(X) genes have a common evolutionary origin."
https://openalex.org/W1569945198,"Abstract alpha 2-Macroglobulin-trypsin complex (alpha 2M.T) and alpha 2M-methylamine bind in a Ca2+-dependent way to a 400- to 500-kDa receptor in rat and human liver membranes (Gliemann, J., Davidsen, O., and Moestrup, S. K. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 980, 326-332). Here we report the preparation of alpha 2M receptors from rat liver membranes solubilized in 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonic acid (CHAPS) dihydrate and incubated with Sepharose-immobilized alpha 2M-methylamine. The receptor preparation eluted with EDTA (pH 6.0) contained a protein larger than the 360-kDa alpha 2M (nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and some minor contaminants. The reduced large protein was about 440 kDa using reduced laminin (heavy chain: 400 kDa) as a standard. About 10 micrograms of receptor protein was obtained from 100 mg of liver membranes. The receptor preparation immobilized on nitrocellulose sheets bound 125I-alpha 2M.T, and the binding activity co-eluted with the 440-kDa protein. 125I-Labeled rat alpha 1-inhibitor-3 (alpha 1I3), a 200-kDa analogue of the alpha 2M subunit which binds to the alpha 2M receptors, was cross-linked to the 440-kDa protein. The receptor preparation was iodinated, and the 125I-labeled 440-kDa protein was isolated. It showed Ca2+-dependent saturable binding to alpha 2M-methylamine. In conclusion, we have purified the major hepatic alpha 2M receptor as an approximately 440-kDa single chain protein."
https://openalex.org/W1510676492,"Abstract The predominant attachment site of the spectrin-based cytoskeleton to the erythrocyte membrane occurs via the interaction of ankyrin with the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (cdb3). In order to further characterize this interaction, we have conducted experiments to localize the ankyrin-binding site on cdb3. Four monoclonal and three antipeptide polyclonal antibodies were raised against cdb3 and used in competition studies to identify regions of close association of cdb3 with ankyrin. Antibodies to regions of cdb3 near the cytoplasmic domain-membrane spanning domain junction had no effect on 125I-ankyrin binding. Likewise, an antibody to a highly conserved region between residues 142 and 154 did not inhibit ankyrin binding. However, antibodies at or near the cysteine 201-317 cluster and the proposed proline-rich hinge in the center of cdb3 were potent inhibitors of ankyrin association, as were antibodies to the acidic NH2 terminus. Additional evidence for interaction of ankyrin with the NH2-terminal region of cdb3 was obtained by demonstrating the ability of ankyrin to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of cdb3 at its NH2 terminus by a purified calf thymus tyrosine kinase. These studies reveal two regions of cdb3, distant in primary sequence, which interact with ankyrin. A specific conformation of cdb3 may be required to permit these regions to simultaneously associate with ankyrin and allow binding to occur."

https://openalex.org/W1516915905,"Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the phosphate starvation-inducible outer membrane porin PhoE of Escherichia coli K-12 to study the molecular basis of its anion selectivity. Lysines 18, 29, 64, and 125 were replaced by glutamic acids, and the properties of the mutant porins were investigated in in vivo and in vitro experiments. Lipid bilayer experiments showed that all these mutations had no influence on the pore structure because PhoE and the mutants had the same single channel conductance in KCl solution. Selectivity measurements revealed that the mutations changed the ionic selectivity of PhoE, but the change was dependent on the location of the lysine. Replacement of Lys18 and Lys29 by glutamic acid had a relatively small influence. The effect of the Lys64 substitution was somewhat larger, and the effect of the replacement of Lys125 resulted in the most drastic change in selectivity and in the loss of the interaction of PhoE with polyphosphate, whereas the replacement of the other lysines had no effect on the polyphosphate interaction behavior. The results are consistent with the assumption that the charge spot in PhoE consists of only 1 lysine per monomer, located in position 125 of the primary sequence and probably close to the pore interior."
https://openalex.org/W1978378245,The cholinergic agonist carbachol was conjugated to latex microspheres that were fluorescently labeled with rhodamine and used as neuroanatomical probes that show little diffusion from their injection site and retrogradely label neurons projecting to the injection site. Microinjection of this pharmacologically active probe into the gigantocellular field of the cat pontine brain stem caused the awake cats to fall into rapid movement (REM) sleep indistinguishable from that produced by free carbachol. Three-dimensional computer reconstruction of the retrogradely labeled neurons revealed a widely distributed neuronal network in the pontine tegmentum. These pharmacologically active microspheres permit a new precision in the characterization and mapping of neurons associated with the control of behavioral state and of other cholinergic networks.

https://openalex.org/W1641714873,"Abstract Calcium uptake and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity in canine cardiac microsomes were found to be stimulated by heparin and various other polyanions. Prior treatment of the microsomes with the ionophores alamethicin or A23187 produced no change in the extent of stimulation of the ATPase activity by heparin yet eliminated net calcium uptake. This finding and a lack of change in the stoichiometric ratio of mol of calcium transported/mol of ATP hydrolyzed (calcium:ATP) suggest that the effect of heparin is on the calcium pump rather than on a parallel calcium efflux pathway. Certain polycationic compounds including poly-L-arginine and histone inhibited both cardiac and fast skeletal muscle microsomal calcium uptake and also produced no change in the stoichiometric ratio of calcium to ATP. Several lines of evidence indicate that the polyanionic compounds tested stimulate calcium uptake by interacting with phospholamban, the putative phosphorylatable regulator of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump, whereas polycationic compounds appear to interact with the pump. (i) Heparin stimulated calcium uptake to the same extent as protein kinase A or trypsin, whereas prior phosphorylation or tryptic cleavage of phospholamban from the membrane abolished the stimulatory effect of heparin. (ii) Calcium uptake and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity in fast skeletal muscle microsomes, which lack phospholamban, were unaffected by heparin. (iii) Purified cardiac (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity was no longer stimulated by heparin yet was still inhibited by polycationic compounds. The heparin-induced stimulation of calcium uptake was dependent on the pH and ionic strength of the heparin-containing preincubation medium, hence electrostatic interactions appear to play a significant role in heparin's stimulatory action. The data are consistent with an inhibitory role of the positively charged cytoplasmic domain of phospholamban with respect to calcium pump activity and the relief of the inhibition upon reduction in phospholamban's positive charge by phosphorylation or binding of polyanions."
https://openalex.org/W1607775109,"Abstract Apolipoprotein (apo) B occurs in two forms, apoB100 (512 kDa) and apoB48 (240 kDa); both are derived from the same gene. A novel mechanism involving editing of the apoB mRNA causes the formation of apoB48; the first base of codon 2153 is changed from cytosine to uracil, converting a glutamine codon to a premature stop codon. To identify the apoB mRNA sequence elements recognized by the apoB mRNA editing mechanism, two apoB cDNA fragments (354 and 63 base pairs) with codon 2153 near their centers were inserted into a high expression vector of another secreted apolipoprotein, apoE. The resulting vectors, pHEB-354 and -63, were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, HepG2 cells, and apoB48-producing CaCo-2 cells. The secreted chimeric apolipoproteins (apoEB354 and apoEB63) were analyzed for premature truncation, and the mRNA was analyzed for the presence of an edited base. The pHEB-354 construct produced a truncated protein only in CaCo-2 cells, whereas pHEB-63 produced no truncated protein in any of the three cell types. The mRNA was converted to cDNA and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction technique. Differential hybridization of the polymerase chain reaction products with CAA (Gln) and TAA (Stop) specific probes detected an edited base only in cDNA from CaCo-2 cells transfected with pHEB-354, in agreement with the protein analysis. We conclude that the nucleotide sequence of the apoB cDNA insert in pHEB-354 contains sufficient information to be edited in CaCo-2 cells. In these cells, a cryptic polyadenylation site was activated in the edited pHEB-354 mRNA. As a result, CaCo-2 cells transfected with pHEB-354 produced a short, edited pHEB-354 mRNA and a long, unedited pHEB-354 mRNA. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with pHEB-354 or CaCo-2 cells transfected with pHEB-63 produced only a full length transcript. Amplification of the pHEB-354 cDNA using 3'-primers upstream and downstream of the poly(A) addition site and hybridization with the TAA probe confirmed these results. This unusual mRNA editing apparently occurs before polyadenylation, probably in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1602070779,"The glycoprotein hormone alpha gene contains a duplicated cAMP-responsive element (CRE) that functions as a classical enhancer and interacts with a transcription factor termed CRE-binding protein. Adjacent to the CRE resides an upstream regulatory element (URE) that binds tissue-specific factors. The URE stimulates basal transcription but requires the CRE to impart its transcriptional effects. Protein binding to the URE and CRE domains is enhanced by linking the elements together, suggesting that interactions occur between the proteins that bind to these regulatory domains. Using gel mobility shift assays, we show that the URE forms distinct complexes with proteins extracted from JEG-3 cells. Two distinct protein-binding domains within the URE were delineated using mutational analyses and methylation interference assays. An upstream domain (-177 to -156 base pairs) interacts with a relatively abundant protein, whereas a downstream domain (-172 to -151 base pairs) binds a less abundant factor. Simultaneous occupancy of the two URE domains was not found, suggesting that binding of proteins to these regions may be mutually exclusive. In transient expression assays, the upstream and downstream domains of the URE were shown to independently enhance CRE-mediated transcription of the alpha gene. However, the downstream domain of the URE imparts greater transcriptional activity than does the upstream domain, and a DNA element that contains both URE domains is less active than is the downstream domain alone. These studies support a mechanism in which the transcriptional activity of a CRE can be differentially modulated by factors that bind to adjacent, but distinct upstream regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W2039899945,"Transformed rat thyroid cells fail to express thyroglobulin. Cells transformed with a Kirsten murine sarcoma virus carrying a temperature-sensitive ras allele lose their transformation phenotype when shifted to the nonpermissive (39°C) temperature. The thyroglobulin promoter, however, remains inactive. Similarly, transfection of these cells with a thyroglobulin promoter fused to a neomycin resistance reporter gene does not produce clones resistant to G418. Treatment of the transfected cells with the DNA demethylating agent 5-azacytidine reactivates the thyroglobulin promoter and yields stable G418-resistant clones. We show that thyroglobulin promoter activity is correlated with the presence of a thyroid-specific nuclear factor, TgTF1. TgTF1 cannot be detected in transformed cells but reappears after treatment with 5-azacytidine at 39°C. Restoration of Ras activity at 33°C leads to the rapid loss of TgTF1 and G418 resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1485381888,"Human beta-endorphin (1-31) (beta H-endorphin) was found to specifically interact with purified complement S protein from human plasma. As found by chemical cross-linking beta H-endorphin bound to both, the 65- and 75-kDa molecular mass forms of S protein. The interaction of S protein with heparin as well as the adsorption of S protein to surfaces led to an almost 10-fold increase of specific binding which was due to the exposure of further beta H-endorphin-binding sites. The interaction of beta H-endorphin with S protein bore characteristics of a ligand-receptor interaction, such as time dependence, reversibility, high affinity, saturability, and structural specificity and was mediated through the non-opioid COOH terminus of the beta H-endorphin molecule. beta H-Endorphin binding to S protein was observed at physiological pH or cation concentrations, indicating that the interaction may well occur in vivo. Our results provide conclusive evidence that interactions of S protein with very different effectors led to similar conformational changes which uniformly resulted in exposure of a highly specific beta H-endorphin binding domain on S protein. With S protein as major beta H-endorphin-binding protein in the periphery, the molecular basis of a widespread system of humoral target sites of the neuroendocrine effector appears to be established. In view of S protein involvement in processes of inflammation and wound repair and beta-endorphin effects on immunocompetent cells, the demonstrated S protein-beta H-endorphin interaction appears to be of considerable functional significance."
https://openalex.org/W1960714090,"Analogues of the 39-residue CNBr fragment of horse cytochrome c (66-104) have been prepared by total chemical synthesis. Conformationally assisted ligation of these peptides with the native cytochrome c fragment 1-65 (homoserine lactone form) occurred in high yield. Semisynthetic protein molecules of the expected molecular weight were obtained that had folded structures similar to the native molecule as shown by spectral properties and by cross-reactivity with a panel of monoclonal antibodies sensitive to the three-dimensional integrity of cytochrome c. Point mutations were introduced into the horse sequence at three strongly conserved sites: Tyr67, Thr78, and Ala83. The contributions of these 3 residues to the stability of the heme crevice were estimated by titration of the 695 nm absorption due to coordination of ferric iron by the sixth ligand methionine sulfur. The roles of these residues in catalysis of electron transfer and in establishing the value of the redox potential of cytochrome c were also investigated. The hydroxyl group of Tyr67 modulates the spectral properties of the heme and has a profound influence on its redox properties, but hydrogen bonding involving this phenolic hydroxyl does not stabilize the heme crevice. In contrast, we find that Thr78 is strongly stabilizing and that asparagine is not an adequate substitute for this residue because of the greater entropic cost of burying its side chain. The low biological activity of analogues modified at this position, despite normal redox potentials, imply a role for Thr78 in the electron transfer mechanism. The replacement of Ala83 by proline induces a similar phenomenon. An involvement of this residue in the catalysis of electron transfer provides an explanation of the low reactivity of plant mitochondrial cytochromes c in mammalian redox systems."
https://openalex.org/W1574616847,"Abstract A monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated 0.5 alpha, derived from a patient with adult T-cell leukemia was found previously to neutralize the human T-cell leukemia/lymphotropic type I (HTLV-I) virus in in vitro assays and bind to the major envelope glycoprotein (gp46) of HTLV-I (Matsushita, S., Guroff, M.R., Trepel, J., Crossman, J., Mitsuya, H., and Broder, S. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 2671-2676). We have designed experiments to determine the epitope for this mAb. Using simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis, we synthesized 481 overlapping octapeptides which corresponded to the sequence of gp46. We mapped the epitope for mAb 0.5 alpha to lie between residues 186 and 195 of gp46. This result was confirmed by independently synthesizing a peptide containing this epitope which bound specifically to mAb 0.5 alpha with an approximate Ka = 4 x 10(7) M-1. In addition, the peptide inhibited mAb 0.5 alpha binding to gp46 derived from T-cells infected with HTLV-I. This epitope containing peptide may facilitate understanding HTLV-1 infection of T-cells."

https://openalex.org/W2155754160,"We have examined the metabolism of the folate analog methotrexate (MTX) in the human parasite Leishmania major. These cells readily hydrolyzed MTX to N-10-methyl-4-deoxy-4-aminopteroate (MAPA), such that following a 24-h incubation in 1 microM [3H]MTX approximately 30% of the cell-associated radioactivity was MAPA. MAPA also accumulated in the culture medium, exceeding the concentration of MTX after 24 h. Neither 7-hydroxy-methotrexate nor MTX polyglutamates were observed in cells or medium, even after a 72-h incubation with MTX. In contrast to MTX, folate is extensively polyglutamylated in L. major (Santi, D. V., Nolan, P., and Shane, B. (1987) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 146, 1089-1092). MAPA was found to be 190-fold less potent than MTX as an inhibitor of leishmanial growth and to bind less tightly than MTX to leishmanial dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase. We therefore examined the possibility that MTX resistance is mediated by increased MTX hydrolysis to MAPA in drug-resistant Leishmania. However, enzymatic assays show that the rate of MTX hydrolysis was unaltered in the MTX-resistant R1000-3 line and the primaquine-resistant PQ-R30 line (which is 24-fold cross-resistant to MTX). In addition to MAPA, several minor unidentified metabolites were observed in the LT252, R1000-5B, and PQR30 cells but no consistent differences in the amounts of these metabolites were evident among these lines. These data indicate that alterations in the rate of MTX hydrolysis in vitro, or in the characteristics of MTX metabolites formed in vivo, do not underly the MTX resistance displayed by the H region-amplified R1000-5B and PQ-R30 lines."
https://openalex.org/W2016468377,"A central principle of neural integration is that excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters effect the opening of distinct classes of membrane ionic channels and that integration consists of the summation of the opposing ionic currents on the postsynaptic membrane. In tangential cells of crayfish optic lobes, a hyperpolarizing, biphasic synaptic potential is produced by the concurrent action of acetylcholine and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). Acetylcholine hyperpolarizes the cell and increases chlorine conductance. GABA depolarizes the cell by closing some of the same chloride channels. Therefore, in this case integration is achieved by the antagonistic actions of two transmitters on the same ionic channel."
https://openalex.org/W1647684986,"Activation of human T cells through the CD3-T cell receptor complex caused an augmentation in the cell surface expression of CD2 and CD5 glycoproteins. Evidence that protein kinase C is involved in the up-regulatory mechanism of these cell surface molecules has been obtained by three different approaches: (a) the changes in antigen expression were observed with activators of protein kinase C such as phorbol esters but not with activators of kinases dependent on calcium/calmodulin or cAMP; (b) the overexpression of CD2 and CD5 is also observed in cells treated with 1,2-dioctanoyl-rac-glycerol, an analogue of the physiological activator of protein kinase C; and (c) 1-(5-isoquinolinyl)-2-methylpiperazine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C but not N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride, an inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent kinase, impairs CD2 and CD5 up-regulation. These changes in cell surface antigen expression appear to be caused by the concomitant increase in the mRNA levels for CD2 and CD5. Phosphorylation studies of the CD2 and CD5 glycoproteins indicated that the overexpression of these molecules was not associated with a specific pattern of phosphorylation since it was observed independently of their hyperphosphorylated or nonphosphorylated state."
https://openalex.org/W1567746758,An in situ screening procedure is described that permits the detection of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity in bacterial colonies expressing the reverse transcriptase of the human immunodeficiency virus.

https://openalex.org/W1582021642,"The human hepatoma Hep3B cells contain integrated hepatitis B viral genome and continually secret hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The production of HBsAg (but not alpha-fetoprotein) was suppressed by addition of low concentrations (0.1-1 nM) of insulin into serum-free medium. In addition, the suppression of HBsAg production by insulin was paralleled with the decrease in HBsAg mRNA abundance. Insulin also cause a rapid rate of disappearance of HBsAg mRNA (t 1/2, 2 h) in Hep3B cells. The Hep3B cells carry specific receptor with high affinity for insulin (Kd = 1.8 nM). The receptor showed an insulin-dependent protein tyrosine kinase activity. The half-maximal insulin concentration for the activation of the receptor kinase was about 5 nM. Only very high concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I and human proinsulin can compete for the insulin receptor binding and suppress HBsAg production, this suggests that insulin may act through its receptor binding to suppress HBsAg expression in human hepatoma Hep3B cells."
https://openalex.org/W1598458491,"Abstract Each of the last 6 peptide bonds in the COOH terminus of [Leu11]substance P [( Leu11]SP) and [Nle11]spantide were replaced with [CH2NH], and each analogue was tested for SP agonist or antagonist activity by determining its ability to interact with SP receptors on dispersed acini from guinea pig pancreas. Each of the 6 spantide and 5 of the 6 SP analogues had no agonist activity, whereas [psi 9-10]SP was an agonist. For the spantide pseudopeptides, the psi 10-11 analogue (Ki,2.8 microM) was equipotent as an antagonist to spantide itself, whereas the psi 9-10, psi 8-9, psi 7-8, and psi 6-7 analogues were 2.5, 7, 5, and 3 times less potent. For the SP pseudopeptides, the psi 10-11 analogue was the most potent antagonist (Ki, 6.2 microM), whereas the psi 8-9, psi 7-8, and psi 6-7 analogues were 7-, 36-, and 39-fold less potent. There was a close correlation between the ability of each pseudopeptide to inhibit binding of 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP and to affect amylase secretion. [psi 10-11]SP inhibited SP-stimulated amylase release in a competitive manner, and its inhibitory ability was specific for the SP receptor. Despite [psi 10-11]SP, spantide, and [psi 10-11]spantide having similar affinities for the SP receptor (Ki, 2-6 microM), for inhibition of binding of 125I-[Tyr4]bombesin, the analogues differed with [psi 10-11]SP having a 50-fold lower affinity than for the SP receptor, whereas [psi 10-11]spantide had a 4-fold lower affinity and spantide a 1.5-fold lower affinity for the SP receptor. These results demonstrate that SP pseudopeptides represent a new class of SP receptor antagonists and, in contrast to the currently described SP receptor antagonists, are more specific for SP receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1499584910,"Abstract Orotic aciduria (type 1) results from a mutation in the gene for UMP synthase, a bifunctional protein containing the two enzyme activities which convert orotic acid and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate to UMP and CO2. In fibroblasts from individuals with orotic aciduria, these two enzymatic activities are about 1% of normal but increase dramatically when deficient cells are grown in the presence of 6-azauridine. Using a polyclonal antiserum to sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured, pure human UMP synthase, we show that fibroblasts from a patient with orotic aciduria have a low level of immunoreactive UMP synthase protein. Pulse-chase analysis reveals that the UMP synthase is degraded rapidly in the deficient cells. Growth of deficient cells in 6-azauridine leads to an increase in UMP synthase protein and its two enzymatic activities via a decreased rate of proteolytic degradation of UMP synthase. UMP synthase in extracts from deficient cells is more readily denatured by heat and is stabilized after growth of cells in 6-azauridine. These data suggest that the detrimental deficiency of this one patient results from a structurally altered UMP synthase that is probably present in low steady-state amounts due to proteolysis and that this labile protein can be stabilized against heat denaturation and proteolytic degradation by 6-aza-UMP."
https://openalex.org/W1490595961,"An Mr 20,000 protein inhibitor of C1, the first component of complement, has been purified from human urine and characterized. This inhibitor, tentatively designated factor J, is apparently distinct from known complement inhibitors. During purification on QAE-Sephadex, Mono Q, and heparin-Sepharose, factor J was detected by its ability to inhibit the complement-mediated lysis of sheep erythrocytes bearing antibody, C1, and activated C4 (EAC14). The purity of factor J was documented by the concordant elution from a hydroxylapatite column of functional activity and the UV absorbance as measured at three different wavelengths (220, 254, and 280 nm). The relative Mr of 20,000 was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-slab gel electrophoresis of radioiodinated protein. Amino acid analysis indicated a high cysteine content and allowed calculations of a specific activity of 7 functional units/pmol. The target of factor J inhibitory activity on the lysis of EAC14 was localized to C1 by the following criteria: factor J inhibited C1 in a C1 transfer assay, but had no effect on C42 activity or decay, and had no effect on the efficiency of isolated C2 or C3-C9 as provided in serum-EDTA. Factor J inhibition was rapid and not significantly influenced by temperature. In a second functional assay, factor J inhibited the association of the tetrameric complex C1r2s2 with 125I-C1q, and the results, when analyzed graphically by a reciprocal plot, were consistent with noncompetitive inhibition (Ki = 529-760 pM range). Functional and/or antigenic data indicated that factor J is distinct from the other known inhibitors of C1, namely the C1 inhibitor and the C1q inhibitor. Antihuman serum precipitated radioiodinated factor J, indicating that an antigen identical or cross-reacting with factor J exists in serum. In summary, factor J is a newly described potent inhibitor of C1 function."
https://openalex.org/W1941272296,"Abstract Mechanisms that could operate to initiate pBR322 DNA replication in the absence of RNase H and DNA polymerase I are described. Two different pathways leading to extensive unwinding of pBR322 DNA have been observed under DNA replication reaction conditions in vitro. In the presence of RNA polymerase and DNA gyrase, specifically initiated RNA II (the leading-strand primer precursor) can form an RNA-DNA hybrid with the template that starts just upstream of the origin of DNA replication and continues for about 3 kilobases. Subsequent digestion of the RNA in this RNA-pBR322 DNA hybrid results in the formation of a highly unwound DNA termed form I. If DNA gyrase is absent during the RNA polymerase-catalyzed elongation of RNA II, a stable RNA-pBR322 DNA hybrid can still form that is localized to the origin region of the genome. Formation of this hybrid activates the primosome assembly site present on the lagging-strand DNA template, by displacing it to a single-stranded conformation, thereby allowing preprimosome assembly. Once assembled, the DNA helicase activity of the preprimosome, in the presence of the single-stranded DNA binding protein and DNA gyrase but in the absence of any further transcription, can also result in extensive unwinding of pBR322 DNA. The product of this reaction, form I DNA, is more unwound than form I DNA. The formation of both form I and form I DNA is inhibited by the presence of excess RNA I, as well as by RNase H at concentrations sufficient to catalyze the normal processing of RNA II required for initiation of leading-strand DNA synthesis. These results suggest that RNA II-pBR322 DNA hybrid formation is essential to permit preprimosome assembly during pBR322 DNA replication under conditions where both RNase H and DNA polymerase I are absent."
https://openalex.org/W1491712576,"Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared from human red blood cells pretreated with diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic stilbene to inhibit anion fluxes. The pH-sensitive probe fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran was incorporated inside the vesicles. Formation of pH gradients due to proton transport by the sodium pump was distinguished from pH gradients formed in response to transmembrane electrical potentials generated by the pump by virtue of their insensitivity and sensitivity, respectively, to dissipation by lipophilic cations. Under the conditions used (pH 6.6), proton transport by the Na,K-ATPase was minimized, and the formation of pH gradients in response to electrical potentials was detected. Thus, the generation of a strophanthidin-sensitive, ATP-dependent electrical potential, inside positive (approximately 1 mV) upon addition of 4 meq of sodium to potassium-filled inside-out vesicles is consistent with the well documented stoichiometry of three sodium ions exchanging with two potassium ions. In contrast, when the cytoplasmic sodium concentration is reduced to less than or equal to 0.4 mM, the potential generated is of the opposite sign, i.e. inside negative, consistent with the decreased Na:K coupling ratio reported previously, i.e. Na:K(Rb) coupling ratios of approximating 1:2 when the sodium concentration is reduced to 0.2 mM (Blostein, R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 12228-12232)."
