https://openalex.org/W2039133821,"Marine ecosystems worldwide are under threat with many fish species and populations suffering from human over-exploitation. This is greatly impacting global biodiversity, economy and human health. Intriguingly, marine fish are largely surveyed using selective and invasive methods, which are mostly limited to commercial species, and restricted to particular areas with favourable conditions. Furthermore, misidentification of species represents a major problem. Here, we investigate the potential of using metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) obtained directly from seawater samples to account for marine fish biodiversity. This eDNA approach has recently been used successfully in freshwater environments, but never in marine settings. We isolate eDNA from ½-litre seawater samples collected in a temperate marine ecosystem in Denmark. Using next-generation DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons, we obtain eDNA from 15 different fish species, including both important consumption species, as well as species rarely or never recorded by conventional monitoring. We also detect eDNA from a rare vagrant species in the area; European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). Additionally, we detect four bird species. Records in national databases confirmed the occurrence of all detected species. To investigate the efficiency of the eDNA approach, we compared its performance with 9 methods conventionally used in marine fish surveys. Promisingly, eDNA covered the fish diversity better than or equal to any of the applied conventional methods. Our study demonstrates that even small samples of seawater contain eDNA from a wide range of local fish species. Finally, in order to examine the potential dispersal of eDNA in oceans, we performed an experiment addressing eDNA degradation in seawater, which shows that even small (100-bp) eDNA fragments degrades beyond detectability within days. Although further studies are needed to validate the eDNA approach in varying environmental conditions, our findings provide a strong proof-of-concept with great perspectives for future monitoring of marine biodiversity and resources."
https://openalex.org/W2097342980,"Quantum teleportation [1] is a quintessential prerequisite of many quantum information processing protocols [2-4]. By using quantum teleportation, one can circumvent the no-cloning theorem [5] and faithfully transfer unknown quantum states to a party whose location is even unknown over arbitrary distances. Ever since the first experimental demonstrations of quantum teleportation of independent qubits [6] and of squeezed states [7], researchers have progressively extended the communication distance in teleportation, usually without active feed-forward of the classical Bell-state measurement result which is an essential ingredient in future applications such as communication between quantum computers. Here we report the first long-distance quantum teleportation experiment with active feed-forward in real time. The experiment employed two optical links, quantum and classical, over 143 km free space between the two Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife. To achieve this, the experiment had to employ novel techniques such as a frequency-uncorrelated polarization-entangled photon pair source, ultra-low-noise single-photon detectors, and entanglement-assisted clock synchronization. The average teleported state fidelity was well beyond the classical limit of 2/3. Furthermore, we confirmed the quality of the quantum teleportation procedure (without feed-forward) by complete quantum process tomography. Our experiment confirms the maturity and applicability of the involved technologies in real-world scenarios, and is a milestone towards future satellite-based quantum teleportation."

https://openalex.org/W2054733823,"Bottom trawling is a non-selective commercial fishing technique whereby heavy nets and gear are pulled along the sea floor. The direct impact of this technique on fish populations and benthic communities has received much attention, but trawling can also modify the physical properties of seafloor sediments, water–sediment chemical exchanges and sediment fluxes. Most of the studies addressing the physical disturbances of trawl gear on the seabed have been undertaken in coastal and shelf environments, however, where the capacity of trawling to modify the seafloor morphology coexists with high-energy natural processes driving sediment erosion, transport and deposition. Here we show that on upper continental slopes, the reworking of the deep sea floor by trawling gradually modifies the shape of the submarine landscape over large spatial scales. We found that trawling-induced sediment displacement and removal from fishing grounds causes the morphology of the deep sea floor to become smoother over time, reducing its original complexity as shown by high-resolution seafloor relief maps. Our results suggest that in recent decades, following the industrialization of fishing fleets, bottom trawling has become an important driver of deep seascape evolution. Given the global dimension of this type of fishery, we anticipate that the morphology of the upper continental slope in many parts of the world’s oceans could be altered by intensive bottom trawling, producing comparable effects on the deep sea floor to those generated by agricultural ploughing on land."
https://openalex.org/W2062163544,"The exploitation of non-invasive samples has been widely used in genetic monitoring of terrestrial species. In aquatic ecosystems, non-invasive samples such as feces, shed hair or skin, are less accessible. However, the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) has recently been shown to be an effective tool for genetic monitoring of species presence in freshwater ecosystems. Detecting species in the marine environment using eDNA potentially offers a greater challenge due to the greater dilution, amount of mixing and salinity compared with most freshwater ecosystems. To determine the potential use of eDNA for genetic monitoring we used specific primers that amplify short mitochondrial DNA sequences to detect the presence of a marine mammal, the harbor porpoise, Phocoena phocoena, in a controlled environment and in natural marine locations. The reliability of the genetic detections was investigated by comparing with detections of harbor porpoise echolocation clicks by static acoustic monitoring devices. While we were able to consistently genetically detect the target species under controlled conditions, the results from natural locations were less consistent and detection by eDNA was less successful than acoustic detections. However, at one site we detected long-finned pilot whale, Globicephala melas, a species rarely sighted in the Baltic. Therefore, with optimization aimed towards processing larger volumes of seawater this method has the potential to compliment current visual and acoustic methods of species detection of marine mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2061510891,"By phosphorylating elongation factors and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) is the critical kinase for transcription elongation and co-transcriptional processing of eukaryotic genes. It exists in inactive small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK snRNP) and active (free P-TEFb) complexes in cells. The P-TEFb equilibrium determines the state of cellular activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Free P-TEFb, which is required for growth, can be recruited to RNA polymerase II via transcription factors, BRD4, or the super elongation complex (SEC). UV light, various signaling cascades, transcriptional blockade, or compounds such as hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and other histone deacetylase inhibitors lead to a rapid release of free P-TEFb, followed by its reassembly into the 7SK snRNP. As a consequence, transcription of HEXIM1, a critical 7SK snRNP subunit, and HIV is induced. In this study, we found that a bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1, which inhibits BRD4 by blocking its association with chromatin, also leads to the rapid release of free P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP. Indeed, JQ1 transiently increased levels of free P-TEFb and BRD4·P-TEFb and SEC·P-TEFb complexes in cells. As a consequence, the levels of HEXIM1 and HIV proteins rose. Importantly, the knockdown of ELL2, a subunit of the SEC, blocked the ability of JQ1 to increase HIV transcription. Finally, the effects of JQ1 and HMBA or SAHA on the P-TEFb equilibrium were cooperative. We conclude that HMBA, SAHA, and JQ1 affect transcription elongation by a similar and convergent mechanism."

To study this peptide, we have raised mAbs against its C-terminal part. Using an immunoaffinity mass spectrometry approach, a whole family of N-terminally extended peptides in addition to RVD-Hpα were identified in rodent brain extracts and human and mouse plasma. We designated these peptides Pepcan-12 (RVDPVNFKLLSH) to Pepcan-23 (SALSDLHAHKLRVDPVNFKLLSH), referring to peptide length. The most abundant Pepcans found in the brain were tested for CB1 receptor binding. In the classical radioligand displacement assay, Pepcan-12 was the most efficacious ligand but only partially displaced both [3H]CP55,940 and [3H]WIN55,212-2. The data were fitted with the allosteric ternary complex model, revealing a cooperativity factor value α < 1, thus indicating a negative allosteric modulation. Dissociation kinetic studies of [3H]CP55,940 in the absence and presence of Pepcan-12 confirmed these results by showing increased dissociation rate constants induced by Pepcan-12. A fluorescently labeled Pepcan-12 analog was synthesized to investigate the binding to CB1 receptors. Competition binding studies revealed Ki values of several Pepcans in the nanomolar range. Accordingly, using competitive ELISA, we found low nanomolar concentrations of Pepcans in human plasma and ∼100 pmol/g in mouse brain. Surprisingly, Pepcan-12 exhibited potent negative allosteric modulation of the orthosteric agonist-induced cAMP accumulation, [35S]GTPγS binding, and CB1 receptor internalization. Pepcans are the first endogenous allosteric modulators identified for CB1 receptors. Given their abundance in the brain, Pepcans could play an important physiological role in modulating endocannabinoid signaling.

Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors are Gαi/o protein-coupled receptors with overall 48% amino acid sequence identity (1Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bonner T.I.

Pharmacological and therapeutic secrets of plant and brain (endo)cannabinoids.Med. Res. Rev. 2009; 29: 213-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Endocannabinoids are pleiotropic and exert multiple physiological effects via CB1 and CB2 receptors but also activate other receptors, such as GPR55 (G protein-coupled receptor 55), TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1), and PPARs (6Di Marzo V. Targeting the endocannabinoid system. To enhance or reduce?.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 438-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The endocannabinoid system is involved in inflammation, pain, and metabolic disorders, and the modulation of CB receptors is a promising strategy for pharmacotherapy (6Di Marzo V.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20588-20593Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) reported that the α-hemoglobin-derived peptide hemopressin (Hpα) with the amino acid sequence PVNFKFLSH competitively binds to the [3H]SR141716 binding site in isolated rat brain membranes. Based on in vitro functional experiments, they concluded that Hpα was CB1 receptor-selective and showed CB1 receptor inverse agonistic effects (8Heimann A.S. Gomes I. Dale C.S. Pagano R.L.

Later, the CB1 receptor-active peptides RVD-Hpα and VD-Hpα were identified in mouse brain extracts using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (10Gomes I. Grushko J.S.

Novel endogenous peptide agonists of cannabinoid receptors.FASEB J. 2009; 23: 3020-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Based on functional assays, RVD-Hpα was suggested to interact rather selectively with CB1 receptors, exerting partial agonistic effects, thus contrasting the effects with Hpα (10Gomes I. Grushko J.S.

Receptor binding assays were carried out with mouse cerebellar membranes. In 2010, the same group postulated that Hpα was probably a hot acid extraction artifact (11Gomes I. Dale C.S. Casten K.

Castro L.M. Ferro E.S. Fricker L.D. Hemopressins and other hemoglobin-derived peptides in mouse brain. Comparison between brain, blood, and heart peptidome and regulation in Cpefat/fat mice.J.

Because CP55,940 shares an identical or at least closely overlapping CB1 receptor binding site with the endocannabinoids AEA and 2-AG, as well as with the inverse agonist SR141716 (rimonabant) (13Reggio P.H. Cannabinoid receptors and their ligands. Ligand-ligand and ligand-receptor modeling approaches.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2005; 168: 247-281Crossref Google Scholar), it was suggested that Hpα partially interacts with the same binding pocket, also based on a recent in silico study using a CB1 receptor homology model (14Scrima M.

The presence of putative CB1 receptor binding peptides in the brain is intriguing and may suggest a functional role for such ligands. To date, all experiments have relied on LC-MS/MS data and extensive prior workup of post-mortem samples (10Gomes I. Grushko J.S. Golebiewska U. Hoogendoorn S. Gupta A. Heimann A.S. Ferro E.S.

Neurochem. 2010; 113: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we have successfully raised monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the C-terminal part of RVD-Hpα to generate the necessary molecular tools to isolate and quantify CB1 receptor-interacting peptides from mouse brain and mouse and human plasma samples. Apart from acidic extraction buffers, we used gentle extraction methods to reduce the probability of generating extraction artifacts. Using immunoaffinity mass spectrometry (MS) experiments, we were able to identify RVD-Hpα and N-terminally extended peptides of RVD-Hpα that we designated Pepcan-12 to -23, referring to the peptide length, but not Hpα and VD-Hpα. The peptides with the highest signal/noise ratios in immunoaffinity MS experiments were then synthesized and tested for CB1 receptor binding in the classical radioligand displacement assay. Pepcan-12 showed the most potent saturable but only partial displacement of [3H]CP55,950 and [3H]WIN55,212-2, suggesting an allosteric modulation. The binding data were fitted with the ternary complex model (TCM), revealing a cooperativity factor value α of less than 1. In dissociation kinetic experiments, Pepcan-12 led to an increase of the dissociation rate constants. Both results support a negative allosteric modulation exerted by Pepcan-12 on the CB1 receptor orthosteric binding site. In agreement, we show that Pepcans negatively modulate the efficacy of CB1 receptor agonist-induced cAMP accumulation, [35S]GTPγS binding, and CB1 receptor internalization. At a functional level, Pepcan-12 strongly reduced the efficacy of 2-AG but not its potency. Pepcans were quantified in the nanomolar range from mouse brain and human plasma by competitive ELISAs. Overall, Pepcans represent the first endogenous allosteric modulators at CB1 receptors, whereas several synthetic allosteric modulators have already been identified (15Horswill J.G. Bali U.

Open table in a new tab A 5 mg/ml solution of peptide 1 (Table 1) in PBS, pH 7.2, was reduced with 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Pierce) for 15 min at room temperature prior to incubation with either a 10 mg/ml solution of maleimide-activated mcKLH carrying a succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate cross-linker (Pierce) or a 10 mg/ml solution of ovalbumin (Pierce) preactivated with the heterobifunctional cross-linker N-(γ-maleimidobutyryloxy)succinimide ester (GMBS) for 2 h at room temperature. The ovalbumin-GMBS conjugate was synthesized using a 30-fold molar excess of sulfo-GMBS (Pierce) in activation buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2) that was applied to a 5 mg/ml solution of ovalbumin and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The conjugates were purified on an ÄKTA prime FPLC device with a 5-ml HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare), concentrated in Amicon-Ultra4 centrifugal filter units (Millipore), and analyzed with SDS-PAGE following Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 staining (Invitrogen). Introduction of fluorescein labels was done by a covalent postsynthetic coupling procedure of fluorescein 5-maleimide (Pierce) to the cysteine-containing peptides 1–4. Therefore, 2 mg of each peptide was dissolved in 200 μl of a 6.25 mg/ml solution of fluorescein 5-maleimide in N,N-dimethylformamide and incubated for 2 h in the dark at room temperature. After evaporation of N,N-dimethylformamide, the products were reconstituted in DMSO and purified and analyzed with preparative HPLC and electrospray ionization MS as described above. For immunization experiments, three female 12-week-old (NZB×NZW)F1 hybrid mice (NZBNZW) from Harlan Laboratories were taken. Approval for animal experimentation was obtained from the responsible authorities, and all experiments were performed in strict accordance with the rules and regulations for the protection of animal rights laid down by the Swiss Bundesamt für Veterinärwesen. Mice were immunized subcutaneously with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-peptide conjugate (Table 1) formulated in Sigma Adjuvant System (Sigma). Starting on day 0, they received three doses of 50 μg of conjugate at 3-week intervals. Blood was collected before each immunization and 2 weeks after the final injection. The blood was centrifuged for 10 min (1500 × g) at 4 °C, and the serum was stored at −80 °C. Three days before the cell fusion, the mouse received an intravenous booster injection with 50 μg of the KLH-peptide conjugate in PBS. The generation of peptide-specific clones was done as described before (20Tamborrini M. Werz D.B. Frey J. Pluschke G. Seeberger P.H.

Cells secreting peptide-specific IgG were identified and screened by ELISA. Four hybridoma cell lines were selected and cloned twice by limiting dilution. mAbs were purified from sterile filtered culture supernatant by protein A affinity chromatography (HiTrap rProtein A FF, Amersham Biosciences) for IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 isotypes and by protein G affinity chromatography (HiTrap Protein G, Amersham Biosciences) for IgG1 isotypes. Purified mAbs were dialyzed against PBS with Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (Pierce), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Protein determinations of samples were carried out in duplicates on Polysorp microtiter plates (Nunc) using the bicinchoninicacid (BCA) protein assay reagent kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Calibration curves were prepared using defined concentrations of BSA. The protein complex absorption was detected at 562 nm. An ELISA was performed to test mouse sera for peptide-specific immune responses. Immulon 4 HBX microtiter plates (Dynex Technologies Inc.) were coated with 50 μl of a 10 μg/ml solution of an ovalbumin-peptide conjugate (Table 1) and ovalbumin (negative control) in PBS, pH 7.2, at 4 °C overnight. After washing once with PBS, 0.05% Tween, wells were blocked with 100 μl of 5% milk powder in PBS for 60 min at 37 °C. After another washing step, plates were incubated with 50 μl of eight 1:3 serial dilutions of mouse sera starting at 1:50 in PBS, 0.5% milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20 for 60 min at 37 °C. After three washing steps, plates were incubated with 50 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (γ-chain-specific) antibodies (Sigma) for 60 min at 37 °C. Phosphatase substrate (1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma)) in 50 μl of buffer (0.14% Na2CO3, 0.3% NaHCO3, 0.02% MgCl2, pH 9.6) was added and incubated at room temperature after another three washing steps. The optical density (OD) of the reaction product was recorded after an appropriate time at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Sunrise, Tecan Trading AG). This ELISA was essentially performed as described before (21Tamborrini M. Mueller M.S. Stoffel S.A. Westerfeld N. Vogel D. Boato F. Zurbriggen R. Robinson J.A. Pluschke G. Design and preclinical profiling of a Plasmodium falciparum MSP-3-derived component for a multivalent virosomal malaria vaccine.Malar. J. 2009; 8: 314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). After coating and blocking steps, mouse serum samples taken 3 weeks after the second and third immunization were added in triplicates at constant dilutions (at half-maximal titer). After a washing step, plates were incubated for 15 min with NH4SCN diluted in 0.1 m Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 6, at the following molarities: 10, 7.5, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.63, and 0.31 m. Control wells were incubated with 0.1 m NaH2PO4 buffer without NH4SCN. After washing, plates were developed as described above. Plates were coated with 50 μl of a 10 μg/ml solution of an ovalbumin-peptide conjugate (Table 1). After blocking and washing, 100 μl of selected hybridoma supernatants were added in duplicates and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. After washing, plates were incubated for 60 min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies specific for IgG (γ-chain-specific) (Sigma), IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, λ, and κ (all from Southern Biotech), and plates were developed as described above. To determine the minimal sequence required for antibody binding, a bead-based peptide array was prepared as previously described (22Poetz O. Ostendorp R. Brocks B. Schwenk J.M. Stoll D. Joos T.O.

The array consisted of the RVD-Hpα peptide (RVDPVNFKLLSH), a carboxamide version of the RVD-Hpα peptide, and 22 truncated peptides. Truncated peptides started from the C or the N terminus of the antigen. C-terminally truncated peptides were synthesized in the form of carboxamides, whereas N-terminal truncations had a carboxyl group at the C terminus. For immobilization purposes, two hydrophilic spacers (8-amino-2,6-dioxaoctanoic acid) and a cysteine were added to the N terminus of all peptides. All peptides were purchased from Intavis. Each of the 24 peptides was conjugated onto a distinct color-coded bead population. For the epitope mapping, 500 beads of each population were mixed to give a peptide array. BSA-coated beads served as a negative control. 30 μl of the premixed bead-based peptide array (500 beads/population) were used to assess the minimal epitopes of the RVD-Hpα peptide-specific mAbs. The mixture of beads was transferred to 96-well filter plates (Merck Millipore) and incubated with 30 μl of the respective RVD-Hpα peptide-specific antibody (1 μg/ml) for 60 min at 23 °C and 650 rpm. Subsequently, beads were washed two times with 100 μl of PBS, 0.05% Tween by vacuum filtration (Merck Millipore). Finally, the formation of the antibody-peptide complexes was detected by incubation with 30 μl of anti-mouse IgG-phycoerythrin conjugate (2.5 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.) for another 45 min at 23 °C and 650 rpm. Following two further washing steps, the beads were resuspended in 100 μl of blocking reagent for ELISA (Roche Applied Science), 0.1% Tween. Read-out of the bead type-specific reporter fluorescence was performed on a Luminex IS 100 system (Luminex Corp.). For brain peptide extractions female 12-week-old NMRI mice were used (Charles River). Hamster and rat brains were a kind gift from the group of Prof. Jennifer Keiser at the SwissTPH. From the sacrificed mice, brains were removed aseptically, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Brains were homogenized (2 × 6000 rpm, 5-min break with cooling on ice) with a Precellys24 tissue homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) in 2-ml tubes containing 1.4-mm ceramic beads (Bertin Technologies) either immediately in extraction buffer for Western blot and immunoaffinity MS experiments or first in double-distilled H2O for spike and recovery experiments following an acetonitrile/H2O (2:1) (ACN 66%) extraction for peptide quantification in competitive ELISA experiments. All brain extraction approaches contained 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The different extraction buffers used were PBS, pH 7.2, ACN/H2O 1:1 (ACN 50%), ACN 66%, 10 mm HCl, and 100 mm acetic acid (AcOH). Rodent brains were homogenized at 0.5 g wet weight/ml extraction buffer with subsequent centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatants of the acid extractions were neutralized with NaOH, and the supernatants of the ACN extractions were evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac (CentriVap Concentrator and CentriVap Cold Trap, Labconco) at 60 °C. All extracts were stored at −80 °C. Human blood samples were drawn with the Vacuette blood collection system (Greiner Bio-One) from healthy female and male volunteers (age 25–30 years) with EDTA as anticoagulant. Mouse blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture with heparin as anticoagulant. The blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Plasma peptide extraction was based on a previous method (7Pacher P. Bátkai S. Kunos G. The endocannabinoid system as an emerging target of pharmacotherapy.Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 389-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). For peptide extraction, ACN was added to thawed plasma (diluted 1:1 with PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.2) in a 2:1 ratio (ACN 66%) or 1:1 ratio (ACN 50%) and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was evaporated to dryness in the SpeedVac at 60 °C. The dried samples were stored at −80 °C. For SDS-PAGE, 100 μl of each mouse brain extract (the ACN brain extracts were reconstituted in 1 ml of PBS, pH 7.2) was diluted 1:1 in 50 μl of LDS 4× sample buffer, 20 μl of 10× reducing agent (Invitrogen), and 30 μl of double-distilled H2O and heated at 70 °C for 10 min. Proteins were separated on a 4–12% BisTris Zoom gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter by dry blotting on the iBlot system (Invitrogen). Blots were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS at 4 °C overnight. The blots were cut into stripes and incubated with mAbs in PBS, 0.5% milk powder, 0.05% Tween for 2 h at room temperature. After four washing steps with PBS, 0.1% Tween, stripes were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Bio-Rad) for 60 min. After washing, blots were developed using the ECL system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). For competitive experiments, cut stripes were incubated with six serial 1:5 dilutions of the synthetic peptide RVD-Hpα (Table 1) starting at 10 μm. As negative control, the similar sized bovine peptide [Val5]angiotensin I (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 10 μm. The mAbs were used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, and the blots were developed as described above (n = 3). Brain and plasma extracts were reconstituted in the initial sample volume using PBS, 0.3% N-octyl glucoside, vortexed for 1 min, and sonicated until they were completely resolved. 100 μl were incubated with 1 μg of anti-RVD-Hpα antibo"

However, these properties have not been studied in 3D so far. Here we report the investigation of the human bone ultrastructure with X-ray phase nanotomography, which now provides the required sensitivity, spatial resolution and field of view. The 3D organization of the lacuno-canalicular network is studied in detail over several cells in osteonal and interstitial tissue. Nanoscale density variations are revealed and show that the cement line separating these tissues is hypermineralized.

The participants who had graphed a more distant pair reported themselves as being significantly less close to members of their own family than did those who had plotted a more closely-situated pair. In another experiment, people's estimates of the caloric content of different foods were reportedly altered by the same type of spatial distance priming. Direct replications of both results were attempted, with precautions to ensure that the experimenter did not know what condition the participant was assigned to. The results showed no hint of the priming effects reported by Williams and Bargh (2008)."
https://openalex.org/W2018893294,"Background Adherence is central to the success of antiretroviral therapy. Supporting adherence has gained importance in HIV care in many national treatment programs. The ubiquity of mobile phones, even in resource-constrained settings, has provided an opportunity to utilize an inexpensive, contextually feasible technology for adherence support in HIV in these settings. We aimed to assess the influence of mobile phone reminders on adherence to antiretroviral therapy in South India. Participant experiences with the intervention were also studied. This is the first report of such an intervention for antiretroviral adherence from India, a country with over 800 million mobile connections. Methods Study design: Quasi-experimental cohort study involving 150 HIV-infected individuals from Bangalore, India, who were on antiretroviral therapy between April and July 2010. The intervention: All participants received two types of adherence reminders on their mobile phones, (i) an automated interactive voice response (IVR) call and (ii) A non-interactive neutral picture short messaging service (SMS), once a week for 6 months. Adherence measured by pill count, was assessed at study recruitment and at months one, three, six, nine and twelve. Participant experiences were assessed at the end of the intervention period. Results The mean age of the participants was 38 years, 27% were female and 90% urban. Overall, 3,895 IVRs and 3,073 SMSs were sent to the participants over 6 months. Complete case analysis revealed that the proportion of participants with optimal adherence increased from 85% to 91% patients during the intervention period, an effect that was maintained 6 months after the intervention was discontinued (p = 0.016). Both, IVR calls and SMS reminders were considered non-intrusive and not a threat to privacy. A significantly higher proportion agreed that the IVR was helpful compared to the SMS (p<0.001). Conclusion Mobile phone reminders may improve medication adherence in HIV infected individuals in this setting, the effect of which was found to persist for at least 6 months after cessation of the intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2005355336,"Background Besides well-established roles of bile acids (BA) in dietary lipid absorption and cholesterol homeostasis, it has recently become clear that BA is also a biological signaling molecule. We have shown that strategies aimed at activating TGR5 by increasing the BA pool size with BA administration may constitute a significant therapeutic advance to combat the metabolic syndrome and suggest that such strategies are worth testing in a clinical setting. Bile acid binding resin (BABR) is known not only to reduce serum cholesterol levels but also to improve glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in animal models and humans. However, the mechanisms by which BABR affects glucose homeostasis have not been established. We investigated how BABR affects glycemic control in diet-induced obesity models. Methods and Findings We evaluated the metabolic effect of BABR by administrating colestimide to animal models for the metabolic syndrome. Administration of BABR increased energy expenditure, translating into significant weight reduction and insulin sensitization. The metabolic effects of BABR coincide with activation of cholesterol and BA synthesis in liver and thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. Interestingly, these effects of BABR occur despite normal food intake and triglyceride absorption. Administration of BABR and BA had similar effects on BA composition and thermogenesis, suggesting that they both are mediated via TGR5 activation. Conclusion Our data hence suggest that BABR could be useful for the management of the impaired glucose tolerance of the metabolic syndrome, since they not only lower cholesterol levels, but also reduce obesity and improve insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2083368015,"Purpose The optimal treatment duration for ventilator-associated pneumonia is based on one study dealing with late-onset of the condition. Shortening the length of antibiotic treatment remains a major prevention factor for the emergence of multiresistant bacteria. Objective To demonstrate that 2 different antibiotic treatment durations (8 versus 15 days) are equivalent in terms of clinical cure for early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia. Methods Randomized, prospective, open, multicenter trial carried out from 1998 to 2002. Measurements The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate at day 21. The mortality rate was evaluated on days 21 and 90. Results 225 patients were included in 13 centers. 191 (84.9%) patients were cured: 92 out of 109 (84.4%) in the 15 day cohort and 99 out of 116 (85.3%) in the 8 day cohort (difference = 0.9%, odds ratio = 0.929). 95% two-sided confidence intervals for difference and odds ratio were [−8.4% to 10.3%] and [0.448 to 1.928] respectively. Taking into account the limits of equivalence (10% for difference and 2.25 for odds ratio), the objective of demonstrative equivalence between the 2 treatment durations was fulfilled. Although the rate of secondary infection was greater in the 8 day than the 15 day cohort, the number of days of antibiotic treatment remained lower in the 8 day cohort. There was no difference in mortality rate between the 2 groups on days 21 and 90. Conclusion Our results suggest that an 8-day course of antibiotic therapy is safe for early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia in intubated patients.

https://openalex.org/W1989639319,"Degradation of recalcitrant polysaccharides in nature is typically accomplished by mixtures of processive and nonprocessive glycoside hydrolases (GHs), which exhibit synergistic activity wherein nonprocessive enzymes provide new sites for productive attachment of processive enzymes. GH processivity is typically attributed to active site geometry, but previous work has demonstrated that processivity can be tuned by point mutations or removal of single loops. To gain additional insights into the differences between processive and nonprocessive enzymes that give rise to their synergistic activities, this study reports the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of the GH family 18 nonprocessive endochitinase, ChiC, from Serratia marcescens. This completes the structural characterization of the co-evolved chitinolytic enzymes from this bacterium and enables structural analysis of their complementary functions. The ChiC catalytic module reveals a shallow substrate-binding cleft that lacks aromatic residues vital for processivity, a calcium-binding site not previously seen in GH18 chitinases, and, importantly, a displaced catalytic acid (Glu-141), suggesting flexibility in the catalytic center. Molecular dynamics simulations of two processive chitinases (ChiA and ChiB), the ChiC catalytic module, and an endochitinase from Lactococcus lactis show that the nonprocessive enzymes have more flexible catalytic machineries and that their bound ligands are more solvated and flexible. These three features, which relate to the more dynamic on-off ligand binding processes associated with nonprocessive action, correlate to experimentally measured differences in processivity of the S. marcescens chitinases. These newly defined hallmarks thus appear to be key dynamic metrics in determining processivity in GH enzymes complementing structural insights."
https://openalex.org/W2082335253,"Background While beneficial health effects of fish and fish oil consumption are well documented, the incorporation of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in plasma lipid classes is not completely understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fish oil supplementation on the plasma lipidomic profile in healthy subjects. Methodology/Principal Findings In a double-blinded randomized controlled parallel-group study, healthy subjects received capsules containing either 8 g/d of fish oil (FO) (1.6 g/d EPA+DHA) (n = 16) or 8 g/d of high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) (n = 17) for seven weeks. During the first three weeks of intervention, the subjects completed a fully controlled diet period. BMI and total serum triglycerides, total-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol were unchanged during the intervention period. Lipidomic analyses were performed using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOFMS), where 568 lipids were detected and 260 identified. Both t-tests and Multi-Block Partial Least Square Regression (MBPLSR) analysis were performed for analysing differences between the intervention groups. The intervention groups were well separated by the lipidomic data after three weeks of intervention. Several lipid classes such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, and triglycerides contributed strongly to this separation. Twenty-three lipids were significantly decreased (FDR<0.05) in the FO group after three weeks compared with the HOSO group, whereas fifty-one were increased including selected phospholipids and triglycerides of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. After seven weeks of intervention the two intervention groups showed similar grouping. Conclusions/Significance In healthy subjects, fish oil supplementation alters lipid metabolism and increases the proportion of phospholipids and triglycerides containing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Whether the beneficial effects of fish oil supplementation may be explained by a remodeling of the plasma lipids into phospholipids and triglycerides of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids needs to be further investigated.

https://openalex.org/W2092933935,"Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections have been linked to a subset of oral and oropharyngeal cancers. However, little is known on the natural history of oral HPV infections. We designed the prospective Finnish HPV Family Study to assess the dynamics of HPV infections in parents and their infants. This study reports HPV genotype distribution and virus persistence in oral mucosa of the mothers. Materials and Methods Totally, 324 pregnant women were enrolled at the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and followed-up for 6 years. Oral scrapings taken with a brush were collected and HPV-genotyping was performed with nested PCR and Multimetrix® test (Progen, Heidelberg, Germany). The predictors of persistent oral HPV species 7/9 infections were analyzed using generalized estimating equation models. Results The point prevalence of oral HPV varied from 15% to 24% during the 6-year follow-up. Altogether, 18 HPV genotypes were identified either as single or multiple-type oral infections. HPV16 was the most prevalent type at 9.7%–18.4%, followed by HPV18, HPV6, and multiple infections. Altogether, 74 women had persistent oral HPV infection determined as at least two consecutive samples positive with the same HPV genotype. HPV16 and HPV6 were the two most frequent types to persist (76% and 9%) for a mean of 18.6 and 20.2 months, respectively, followed by multiple infections (8%) for 18.3 months. An increased risk for persistent oral HPV infection with species 7/9 was associated with being seropositive for low-risk (LR)-HPV-types at baseline, whereas the use of oral contraceptives and a second pregnancy during follow-up were protective. Clinical oral lesions were detected in 17% of these women, one-third of whom had persistent oral HPV-infections. Conclusion HPV16 and HPV6 were the most common genotypes in oral HPV-infections and were also most likely to persist. Use of oral contraceptives and a second pregnancy protected against oral HPV persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2127815528,"The receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3 is an important growth factor receptor in hematopoiesis, and gain-of-function mutations of the receptor contribute to the transformation of acute myeloid leukemia. SOCS6 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 6) is a member of the SOCS family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that can regulate receptor tyrosine kinase signal transduction. In this study, we analyzed the role of SOCS6 in Flt3 signal transduction. The results show that ligand stimulation of Flt3 can induce association of SOCS6 and Flt3 and tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS6. Phosphopeptide fishing indicated that SOCS6 binds directly to phosphotyrosines 591 and 919 of Flt3. By using stably transfected Ba/F3 cells with Flt3 and/or SOCS6, we show that the presence of SOCS6 can enhance ubiquitination of Flt3, as well as internalization and degradation of the receptor. The presence of SOCS6 also induces weaker activation of Erk1/2, but not Akt, in transfected Ba/F3 and UT-7 cells and in OCI-AML-5 cells. The absence of SOCS6 promotes Ba/F3 and UT-7 cell proliferation induced by oncogenic internal tandem duplications of Flt3. Taken together, these results suggest that SOCS6 negatively regulates Flt3 activation, the downstream Erk signaling pathway, and cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2051163666,"The sigma-1 receptor (Sig1R) is up-regulated in many human tumors and plays a role in the control of cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. At the molecular level, the Sig1R modulates the activity of various ion channels, apparently through a direct interaction. We have previously shown using atomic force microscopy imaging that the Sig1R binds to the trimeric acid-sensing ion channel 1A with 3-fold symmetry. Here, we investigated the interaction between the Sig1R and the Nav1.5 voltage-gated Na+ channel, which has also been implicated in promoting the invasiveness of cancer cells. We show that the Sig1R and Nav1.5 can be co-isolated from co-transfected cells, consistent with an intimate association between the two proteins. Atomic force microscopy imaging of the co-isolated proteins revealed complexes in which Nav1.5 was decorated by Sig1Rs. Frequency distributions of angles between pairs of bound Sig1Rs had two peaks, at ∼90° and ∼180°, and the 90° peak was about twice the size of the 180° peak. These results demonstrate that the Sig1R binds to Nav1.5 with 4-fold symmetry. Hence, each set of six transmembrane regions in Nav1.5 likely constitutes a Sig1R binding site, suggesting that the Sig1R interacts with the transmembrane regions of its partners. Interestingly, two known Sig1R ligands, haloperidol and (+)-pentazocine, disrupted the Nav1.5/Sig1R interaction both in vitro and in living cells.

Evidence has been presented recently that the hallucinogen N,N-dimethyltryptamine is an endogenous ligand at the Sig1R (23Fontanilla D. Johannessen M. Hajipour A.R. Cozzi N.V. Jackson M.B. Ruoho A.E. The hallucinogen N N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an endogenous sigma-1 receptor regulator.Science. 2009; 323: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). There is some evidence that modulation of ion channel function by the Sig1R is direct; for instance, its effects on the Kv1.4 voltage-gated K+ channel do not involve transduction mechanisms such as G protein signaling or phosphorylation (24Lupardus P.J.

Furthermore, the Sig1R can be co-immunoprecipitated with Kv1.4 from membrane lysates prepared from both rat posterior pituitary cells and mRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes (5Aydar E. Palmer C.P.

Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, we recently demonstrated at the single molecule level that the Sig1R directly interacts with the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC)1a, which is known to assemble as a trimer (25Jasti J.

Demonstration of a direct interaction between sigma-1 receptors and acid-sensing ion channels.Biophys. J. 2010; 98: 1182-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This interaction likely underlies the ability of the Sig1R endogenously expressed in rat cortical neurons to inhibit ASIC1a-mediated membrane currents and thereby reduce consequent intracellular Ca2+ accumulation (17Herrera Y. Katnik C. Rodriguez J.D. Hall A.A. Willing A. Pennypacker K.R. Cuevas J. σ-1 receptor modulation of acid sensing ion channel a (ASIC1a) and ASIC1a-induced Ca2+ influx in rat cortical neurons.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 327: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused on the interaction between the Sig1R and the voltage-gated Na+ channel Nav1.5, which incorporates four sets of six transmembrane regions (TMRs) within a single polypeptide (28Catterall W.A.

Nav1.5 is responsible for the rapid upstroke of the action potential in cardiac myocytes and for the rapid propagation of the cardiac action potential. Significantly, it is also implicated in promoting the invasiveness of breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-231 (29Roger S. Besson P. Le Guennec J.Y.

The hallucinogen N N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an endogenous sigma-1 receptor regulator.Science. 2009; 323: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). For example, (+)-pentazocine reversibly inhibited Nav1.5 channels stably expressed in HEK-293 cells and in cardiac myocytes but had a much smaller effect in Sig1R knock-out myocytes (3Johannessen M. Ramachandran S. Riemer L. Ramos-Serrano A. Ruoho A.E. Jackson M.B. Voltage-gated sodium channel modulation by σ-receptor in cardiac myocytes and heterologous systems.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 296: C1049-C1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, the putative endogenous Sig1R ligand, had similar inhibitory effects on Nav1.5 currents and induced hypermobility in mice that was abrogated when the Sig1R was knocked out (23Fontanilla D. Johannessen M. Hajipour A.R. Cozzi N.V. Jackson M.B. Ruoho A.E. The hallucinogen N N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an endogenous sigma-1 receptor regulator.Science. 2009; 323: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In contrast, progesterone acted as an antagonist at the Sig1R, blocking the inhibitory effects of ligands such as N,N-dimethyltryptamine on Nav1.5 (4Johannessen M. Fontanilla D. Mavlyutov T. Ruoho A.E. Jackson M.B. Antagonist action of progesterone at σ-receptors in the modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels.Am. J. Physiol.

We set out to examine the structure of the complex formed between the Sig1R and Nav1.5 and to test whether the Sig1R/Nav1.5 interaction has functional consequences for Nav1.5 activity in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We show using AFM imaging that the Sig1R binds to Nav1.5 with 4-fold symmetry, suggesting that the Sig1R interacts with its partner proteins via their TMRs. We also show that Nav1.5 currents in MDA-MB-231 cells fall when Sig1R expression is reduced. tsA 201 cells (a subclone of HEK-293 cells stably expressing the SV40 large T-antigen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, kindly provided by Dr. Laurent Combettes (Université de Paris-Sud), was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. cDNA encoding the human Sig1R, with a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag, was subcloned into the vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His using HindIII and AgeI so as to delete the V5 epitope tag but leave the His6 tag. (The His6 tag was not used in any of the experiments described here.) The sequence of the construct was verified before use. cDNA encoding human Nav1.5, with a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag, in the vector pcDNA3N, was kindly provided by Dr. C. Valdivia (University of Michigan). Transient transfections of tsA 201 cells with DNA were carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. A total of 250 μg of DNA was used to transfect cells in 5 × 162 cm2 culture flasks. For co-transfections with Sig1R-FLAG and Nav1.5-HA, 125 μg of DNA for each construct was used. After transfection, cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C to allow protein expression. Protein expression and intracellular localization were checked using immunofluorescence analysis of small-scale cultures. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies (mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Covance), rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (Sigma), and mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (Invitrogen), as a negative control), followed by either Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse, Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Sigma). Cells were imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy. To test for endogenous expression of the Sig1R, cell extracts were immunoblotted using a rabbit anti-Sig1R polyclonal antibody (Abcam). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Transfected cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h, before centrifugation at 61,740 × g to remove insoluble material. To capture Nav1.5-HA, the solubilized extract was incubated with anti-HA-agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h. The beads were washed extensively, and bound proteins were eluted with HA peptide (100 μg/ml). Sig1R-FLAG was captured in the same way using anti-FLAG-agarose beads and a triple-FLAG peptide (Sigma). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie blue staining and/or immunoblotting, using mouse monoclonal antibodies against HA or FLAG. Where appropriate, band densitometry was carried out using NIH ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). To establish whether Sig1R-FLAG and Nav1.5-HA interacted at the plasma membrane, intact co-transfected cells were biotinylated by incubation with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce; 1 mg/ml) for 30 min. A detergent extract of the cells was then produced as described above. Biotinylated proteins were incubated with monomeric avidin-agarose (Pierce) for 1 h. The beads were washed extensively, and bound proteins were eluted with free biotin (2 mm). Eluted Sig1R-FLAG was captured using anti-FLAG-agarose beads and eluted with triple-FLAG peptide (Sigma). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting, using mouse monoclonal antibodies against HA and FLAG. Isolated protein samples were diluted to a final concentration of 0.04 nm, and 45 μl of the sample was allowed to adsorb to freshly cleaved mica disks. After a 5-min incubation, the sample was washed with Biotechnology Performance Certified-grade water (Sigma) and dried under nitrogen. Imaging was performed with a Veeco Digital Instruments Multimode AFM controlled by a Nanoscope IIIa controller. Samples were imaged in air, using the tapping mode. The silicon cantilevers used had a drive frequency ∼300 kHz and a specified spring constant of 40 N/m (Olympus). The applied imaging force was kept as low as possible (As/A0 ∼0.85). For individual Sig1R particles, molecular volumes were determined using Scanning Probe Image Processor (version 5; Image Metrology). It is well known that the geometry of the scanning AFM probe introduces a tendency to overestimate particle diameter. To minimize this probe convolution error, we used a Scanning Probe Image Processor particle threshold of 0.1 nm to provide accurate measurements of diameter. For particles within complexes, particle heights and diameters were measured manually using the Nanoscope software and used to calculate molecular volumes, according to Equation 1,Vm=(πh/6)(3r2+h2)(Eq. 1) where h is the particle height and r is the radius (32Schneider S.W. Lärmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithner H. Molecular weights of individual proteins correlate with molecular volumes measured by atomic force microscopy.Pflügers Arch. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This equation assumes that the adsorbed particles adopt the form of a spherical cap. Molecular volume based on molecular mass was calculated using Equation 2,Vc=(M0/N0)(V1+dV2)(Eq. 2) where M0 is the molecular mass, N0 is Avogadro's number, V1 and V2 are the partial specific volumes of particle (0.74 cm3/g) and water (1 cm3/g), respectively, and d is the extent of protein hydration (taken as 0.4 g water/g protein). Several criteria were used to identify Nav1.5·Sig1R complexes. Heights and radii were measured for all particles, and the particle volumes were calculated. Bound particles needed to have a molecular volume between 30 and 120 nm3, which was the experimentally determined volume range for a Sig1R. A cross-section was drawn through the junction between the Sig1R and the adjacent Nav1.5 channel, and the height of the lowest point between receptor and channel was measured. This height needed to be greater than 0.3 nm for the Sig1R to be considered bound. Any particle was rejected if its length was greater than twice its width. To be considered a double binding event, all particles and both binding events needed to meet all of the above criteria. Note that it has been shown previously (32Schneider S.W. Lärmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithner H. Molecular weights of individual proteins correlate with molecular volumes measured by atomic force microscopy.Pflügers Arch. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) that the molecular volumes of proteins measured by imaging in air are similar to the values obtained by imaging under fluid; hence, the process of drying does not significantly affect the measured molecular volume. It has also been shown by the authors (33Neaves K.J. Cooper L.P. White J.H. Carnally S.M. Dryden D.T. Edwardson J.M. Henderson R.M. Atomic force microscopy of the EcoKI type I DNA restriction enzyme bound to DNA shows enzyme dimerization and DNA looping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 2053-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and by others (32Schneider S.W.

Molecular weights of individual proteins correlate with molecular volumes measured by atomic force microscopy.Pflügers Arch. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) that there is a close correspondence between the measured and predicted molecular volumes for various proteins over a wide range of molecular masses; hence, molecular volume is measured reasonably accurately by AFM imaging. Histograms were drawn with bin widths chosen according to Scott's equation,Bin width=3.5σ/n1/3(Eq. 3) where σ is an estimate of the S.D. and n is the sample size (34Scott D.W. On optimal and data-based histograms.Biometrika. 1979; 66: 605-610Crossref Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Where Gaussian curves were fitted to the data, the number of curves was chosen so as to maximize the r2 value while giving significantly different means using Welch's t test for unequal sample sizes and unequal variances (35Welch B.L. The generalization of student's problems when several different population variances are involved.Biometrika. 1947; 34: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar). Cells growing on lysine- and collagen-coated glass coverslips in 3.5-cm diameter culture wells were co-transfected with 1.5 μg each of DNA encoding Nav1.5-HA and Sig1R-FLAG. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C to allow protein expression. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit polyclonal anti-HA plus mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG, both diluted 1:50) for a further 1 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse (+) and anti-rabbit (−) proximity ligation secondary antibodies, diluted 1:5, at 37 °C (36Söderberg O. Gullberg M. Jarvius M. Ridderstråle K. Leuchowius K.J. Jarvius J. Wester K. Hydbring P. Bahram F. Larsson L.G. Landegren U.

These antibodies were obtained as part of a kit from Olink Bioscience, which also included ligation and amplification buffers. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in T4 DNA ligase diluted 1:40 in ligation buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with TBS-T (150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4), and DNA amplification was performed by incubation with 1:80 DNA polymerase in amplification buffer for 100 min at 37 °C. This buffer also contained a fluorescent detection probe (excitation wavelength, 554 nm; emission wavelength, 576 nm). Cells were washed with 1× TBS (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and then 0.01× TBS. Coverslips were mounted on slides and imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2019781550,"ATF4 is an osteoblast-enriched transcription factor of the leucine zipper family. We recently identified that vimentin, a leucine zipper-containing intermediate filament protein, suppresses ATF4-dependent osteocalcin (Ocn) transcription and osteoblast differentiation. Here we show that TGFβ inhibits ATF4-dependent activation of Ocn by up-regulation of vimentin expression. Osteoblasts lacking Atf4 (Atf4−/−) were less sensitive than wild-type (WT) cells to the inhibition by TGFβ on alkaline phosphatase activity, Ocn transcription and mineralization. Importantly, the anabolic effect of a monoclonal antibody neutralizing active TGFβ ligands on bone in WT mice was blunted in Atf4−/− mice. These data establish that ATF4 is required for TGFβ-related suppression of Ocn transcription and osteoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, TGFβ did not directly regulate the expression of ATF4; instead, it enhanced the expression of vimentin, a negative regulator of ATF4, at the post-transcriptional level. Accordingly, knockdown of endogenous vimentin in 2T3 osteoblasts abolished the inhibition of Ocn transcription by TGFβ, confirming an indirect mechanism by which TGFβ acts through vimentin to suppress ATF4-dependent Ocn activation. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, but not canonical Smad signaling, downstream of TGFβ, blocked TGFβ-induced synthesis of vimentin, and inhibited ATF4-dependent Ocn transcription in osteoblasts. Thus, our study identifies that TGFβ stimulates vimentin production via PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling, which leads to suppression of ATF4-dependent Ocn transcription and osteoblast differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2112271922,"The majority of characterized cytochrome P450 enzymes in actinomycete secondary metabolic pathways are strictly substrate-, regio-, and stereo-specific. Examples of multifunctional biosynthetic cytochromes P450 with broader substrate and regio-specificity are growing in number and are of particular interest for biosynthetic and chemoenzymatic applications. MycG is among the first P450 monooxygenases characterized that catalyzes both hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions in the final biosynthetic steps, leading to oxidative tailoring of the 16-membered ring macrolide antibiotic mycinamicin II in the actinomycete Micromonospora griseorubida. The ordering of steps to complete the biosynthetic process involves a complex substrate recognition pattern by the enzyme and interplay between three tailoring modifications as follows: glycosylation, methylation, and oxidation. To understand the catalytic properties of MycG, we structurally characterized the ligand-free enzyme and its complexes with three native metabolites. These include substrates mycinamicin IV and V and their biosynthetic precursor mycinamicin III, which carries the monomethoxy sugar javose instead of the dimethoxylated sugar mycinose. The two methoxy groups of mycinose serve as sensors that mediate initial recognition to discriminate between closely related substrates in the post-polyketide oxidative tailoring of mycinamicin metabolites. Because x-ray structures alone did not explain the mechanisms of macrolide hydroxylation and epoxidation, paramagnetic NMR relaxation measurements were conducted. Molecular modeling based on these data indicates that in solution substrate may penetrate the active site sufficiently to place the abstracted hydrogen atom of mycinamicin IV within 6 Å of the heme iron and ~4 Å of the oxygen of iron-ligated water."
https://openalex.org/W2064694581,"UCP1 catalyzes proton leak across the mitochondrial inner membrane to disengage substrate oxidation from ATP production. It is well established that UCP1 is activated by fatty acids and inhibited by purine nucleotides, but precisely how this regulation occurs remains unsettled. Although fatty acids can competitively overcome nucleotide inhibition in functional assays, fatty acids have little effect on purine nucleotide binding. Here, we present the first demonstration that fatty acids induce a conformational change in UCP1. Palmitate dramatically changed the binding kinetics of 2'/3'-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-GDP, a fluorescently labeled nucleotide analog, for UCP1. Furthermore, palmitate accelerated the rate of enzymatic proteolysis of UCP1. The altered kinetics of both processes indicate that fatty acids change the conformation of UCP1, reconciling the apparent discrepancy between existing functional and ligand binding data. Our results provide a framework for how fatty acids and nucleotides compete to regulate the activity of UCP1."
https://openalex.org/W2033436322,"Adhesion of motile cells to solid surfaces is necessary to transmit forces required for propulsion. Unlike mammalian cells, Dictyostelium cells do not make integrin mediated focal adhesions. Nevertheless, they can move rapidly on both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. We have found that adhesion to such surfaces can be inhibited by addition of sugars or amino acids to the buffer. Treating whole cells with αlpha-mannosidase to cleave surface oligosaccharides also reduces adhesion. The results indicate that adhesion of these cells is mediated by van der Waals attraction of their surface glycoproteins to the underlying substratum. Since glycoproteins are prevalent components of the surface of most cells, innate adhesion may be a common cellular property that has been overlooked."
https://openalex.org/W2046629819,"The knowledge of the host-guest complexes using cyclodextrins (CDs) has prompted an increase in the development of new formulations. The capacity of these organic host structures of including guest within their hydrophobic cavities, improves physicochemical properties of the guest. In the case of pesticides, several inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins have been reported. However, in order to explore rationally new pesticide formulations, it is essential to know the effect of cyclodextrins on the properties of guest molecules. In this study, the inclusion complexes of bentazon (Btz) with native βCD and two derivatives, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) and sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBECD), were prepared by two methods: kneading and freeze-drying, and their characterization was investigated with different analytical techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). All these approaches indicate that Btz forms inclusion complexes with CDs in solution and in solid state, with a stoichiometry of 1∶1, although some of them are obtained in mixtures with free Btz. The calculated association constant of the Btz/HPCD complex by DPV was 244±19 M−1 being an intermediate value compared with those obtained with βCD and SBECD. The use of CDs significantly increases Btz photostability, and depending on the CDs, decreases the surface tension. The results indicated that bentazon forms inclusion complexes with CDs showing improved physicochemical properties compared to free bentazon indicating that CDs may serve as excipient in herbicide formulations."
https://openalex.org/W2081474383,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a nonselective cation channel activated by multiple stimuli and is implicated in a variety of pain disorders. Dynamic sensitization of TRPV1 activity by A-kinase anchoring protein 150 demonstrates a critical role for scaffolding proteins in nociception, yet few studies have investigated scaffolding proteins capable of mediating receptor desensitization. In this study, we identify β-arrestin-2 as a scaffolding protein that regulates TRPV1 receptor activity. We report β-arrestin-2 association with TRPV1 in multiple cell models. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of β-arrestin-2 in primary cultures resulted in a significant increase in both initial and repeated responses to capsaicin. Electrophysiological analysis further revealed significant deficits in TRPV1 desensitization in primary cultures from β-arrestin-2 knock-out mice compared with wild type. In addition, we found that β-arrestin-2 scaffolding of phosphodiesterase PDE4D5 to the plasma membrane was required for TRPV1 desensitization. Importantly, inhibition of PDE4D5 activity reversed β-arrestin-2 desensitization of TRPV1. Together, these results identify a new endogenous scaffolding mechanism that regulates TRPV1 ligand binding and activation."
https://openalex.org/W1968688054,"We found that Icaritin, an intestinal metabolite of Epimedium-derived flavonoids (EF) enhanced osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) only under osteogenic induction conditions. We also demonstrated its effect on inhibition of adipogenic differentiation of MSCs. Unlike the findings of others on EF compounds, we showed that Icaritin was unable to promote proliferation, migration and tube like structure formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. These results suggested that the exogenous phytomolecule Icaritin possessed the potential for enhancing bone formation via its osteopromotive but not an osteoinductive mechanism. Though some flavonoids were shown to regulate the coupling process of angiogenesis and osteogenesis during bone repair, our results suggested that Icaritin did not have direct effect on enhancing angiogenesis in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2137739349,"Altered peptide antigens that enhance T-cell immunogenicity have been used to improve peptide-based vaccination for a range of diseases. Although this strategy can prime T-cell responses of greater magnitude, the efficacy of constituent T-cell clonotypes within the primed population can be poor. To overcome this limitation, we isolated a CD8(+) T-cell clone (MEL5) with an enhanced ability to recognize the HLA A*0201-Melan A(27-35) (HLA A*0201-AAGIGILTV) antigen expressed on the surface of malignant melanoma cells. We used combinatorial peptide library screening to design an optimal peptide sequence that enhanced functional activation of the MEL5 clone, but not other CD8(+) T-cell clones that recognized HLA A*0201-AAGIGILTV poorly. Structural analysis revealed the potential for new contacts between the MEL5 T-cell receptor and the optimized peptide. Furthermore, the optimized peptide was able to prime CD8(+) T-cell populations in peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolates from multiple HLA A*0201(+) individuals that were capable of efficient HLA A*0201(+) melanoma cell destruction. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that it is possible to design altered peptide antigens for the selection of superior T-cell clonotypes with enhanced antigen recognition properties."
https://openalex.org/W1999265324,"Embryonic implantation to establish a pregnancy is a complex process that requires appropriate communication between the embryo and the maternal endometrium. Inadequate uterine receptivity may contribute to the majority of implantation failures. To provide a comprehensive inventory of genes and functional networks that represent the maternal input of the embryo-maternal cross-talk, a longitudinal, holistic study of the endometrial transcriptome in relation to the days of estrous and to the receptivity of the endometrium was performed in bovine. At day 3 of estrous, genes related to cell communication and mitochondrial energy metabolism were differentially expressed among high- and low-receptive endometria (HR, LR); at day 7, transcripts functioning in immune and inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis had different abundances. Additionally, temporal transcriptional changes between days 3 and 7 differed considerably among HR and LR. Further, several transcription factors were predicted as relevant for receptivity because they were either differentially expressed among HR and LR animals or are known to be associated with genes we detected to have differential expression. Finally, global DNA methylation varied according to the interaction of receptivity group and day of estrous, and a divergent trend, which correlated with abundance of DNMT1 transcript, was observed in LR and HR along the estrous cycle days. The study revealed that, even in early estrous, transcripts related to cell communication and response to exogenous stimuli, vascularization, and energy supply show divergent expression and longitudinal temporal regulation in HR and LR. Key components of these molecular pathways are known to be dependent on ovarian hormones that promote uterine receptivity."

For the purpose of a gene mapping study, several pedigrees were ascertained with multiple affected family members. Seventeen families with a total of 71 individuals (including 45 affected or possibly affected) were recruited at clinical centers in 7 countries under the auspices of the MacTel Project. The disease inheritance was consistent with autosomal dominant segregation with reduced penetrance. Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed, followed by analysis of recombination breakpoints. Linkage analysis identified a single peak with multi-point LOD score of 3.45 on chromosome 1 at 1q41-42 under a dominant model. Recombination mapping defined a minimal candidate region of 15.6 Mb, from 214.32 (rs1579634; 219.96 cM) to 229.92 Mb (rs7542797; 235.07 cM), encompassing the 1q41-42 linkage peak. Sanger sequencing of the top 14 positional candidates genes under the linkage peak revealed no causal variants in these pedigrees."

Blood cultures and clinically indicated radiology were also performed. Patients were classified as having confirmed or suspected bacterial (BM), tuberculous (TBM), cryptococcal (CRM), eosinophilic (EOM) meningitis, aseptic encephalitis/meningitis (AEM), neurocysticercosis and others.352 (male: 66%) patients were recruited: median age 34 years (range 13-85). 95/352 (27.3%) diagnoses were laboratory confirmed and one by cranial radiology: BM (n = 62), TBM (n = 9), AEM (n = 19), CRM (n = 5), and neurocysticercosis (n = 1, cranial radiology). S. suis predominated as the cause of BM [48/62 (77.4%)]; Listeria monocytogenese (n = 1), S. pasteurianus (n = 1) and N. meningitidis (n = 2) were infrequent. AEM viruses were: HSV (n = 12), VZV (n = 5) and enterovirus (n = 2). 5 patients had EOM.

S. suis was the most common cause of BM in this setting. Improved diagnostics are needed for meningoencephalitic syndromes to inform treatment and prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2085016242,"Auto-reactive B lymphocytes and its abnormal CD40 signaling play important roles in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this study, we analyzed CD40 expression and CD40/CD154 induced activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in B cells from SLE patients. B cells from healthy volunteers and tonsilar B cells from chronic tonsillitis were used as negative and positive controls. Results showed CD40-induced NF-κB signaling was constitutively activated in B cells from active lupus patients, including decreased CD40 in raft portion, increased phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, phosphorylation of P65, as well as increased nuclear translocation of P65, P50, c-Rel, which could be blocked by anti-CD154. CD154 stimulation could induce further phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, as well as phosphorylation of P65 and nuclear translocation of P65. In addition, CD40-induced kinase activities in B cells from lupus patients mimicked that of tonsil B cells, in that IKKα/β were more activated compared to normal B cells. CD40-induced NF-κB activity was blocked by both IκB phosphorylation and proteosome degradation inhibitors in both lupus and normal B cells. All together, our findings revealed that canonical NF-κB signaling is constitutively activated in active lupus and is mediated by CD154/CD40. CD40 induced NF-κB activation is different in human lupus B lymphocytes compared with normal B cells."

A. bertholletius is represented by nineteen isolates from samples of brazil nuts at various stages of production and soil close to Bertholletia excelsa trees. The following extrolites were produced by this species: aflavinin, cyclopiazonic acid, kojic acid, tenuazonic acid and ustilaginoidin C. Phylogenetic analysis using partial β-tubulin and camodulin gene sequences showed that A. bertholletius represents a new phylogenetic clade in Aspergillus section Flavi.

https://openalex.org/W2020911423,"To date, few mutations are described to underlie highly-elevated HDLc levels in families. Here we sequenced the coding regions and adjacent sequence of the LIPG, CETP, and GALNT2 genes in 171 unrelated Dutch Caucasian probands with HDLc≥90th percentile and analyzed segregation of mutations with lipid phenotypes in family members. In these probands, mutations were most frequent in LIPG (12.9%) followed by GALNT2 (2.3%) and CETP (0.6%). A total of 6 of 10 mutations in these three genes were novel (60.0%), and mutations segregated with elevated HDLc in families. Interestingly, the LIPG mutations N396S and R476W, which usually result in elevated HDLc, were unexpectedly found in 6 probands with low HDLc (i.e., ≤10th percentile). However, 5 of these probands also carried mutations in ABCA1, LCAT, or LPL. Finally, no CETP and GALNT2 mutations were found in 136 unrelated probands with low HDLc. Taken together, we show that rare coding and splicing mutations in LIPG, CETP, and GALNT2 are enriched in persons with hyperalphalipoproteinemia and segregate with elevated HDLc in families. Moreover, LIPG mutations do not overcome low HDLc in individuals with ABCA1 and possibly LCAT and LPL mutations, indicating that LIPG affects HDLc levels downstream of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2005936873,"One great challenge of genomic research is to efficiently and accurately identify complex gene regulatory networks. The development of high-throughput technologies provides numerous experimental data such as DNA sequences, protein sequence, and RNA expression profiles makes it possible to study interactions and regulations among genes or other substance in an organism. However, it is crucial to make inference of genetic regulatory networks from gene expression profiles and protein interaction data for systems biology. This study will develop a new approach to reconstruct time delay Boolean networks as a tool for exploring biological pathways. In the inference strategy, we will compare all pairs of input genes in those basic relationships by their corresponding -scores for every output gene. Then, we will combine those consistent relationships to reveal the most probable relationship and reconstruct the genetic network. Specifically, we will prove that state transition pairs are sufficient and necessary to reconstruct the time delay Boolean network of nodes with high accuracy if the number of input genes to each gene is bounded. We also have implemented this method on simulated and empirical yeast gene expression data sets. The test results show that this proposed method is extensible for realistic networks."
https://openalex.org/W2009681595,"There are conflicting reports on the role of cytochrome c during insect apoptosis. Our previous studies have showed that cytochrome c released from the mitochondria was an early event by western blot analysis and caspase-3 activation was closely related to cytochrome c release during apoptosis induced by baculovirus in Spodoptera litura cells (Sl-1 cell line). In the present study, alteration in mitochondrial morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria in apoptotic Sl-1 cells induced with Anagrapha falcifera multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AfMNPV) has further been confirmed by immunofluoresence staining protocol, suggesting that structural disruption of mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c are important events during Lepidoptera insect cell apoptosis. We also used Sl-1 cell-free extract system and the technique of RNA interference to further investigate the role of cytochrome c in apoptotic Sl-1 cells induced by AfMNPV. Caspase-3 activity in cell-free extracts supplemented with exogenous cytochrome c was determined and showed an increase with the extension of incubation time. DsRNA-mediated silencing of cytochrome c resulted in the inhibition of apoptosis and protected the cells from AfMNPV-induced cell death. Silencing of expression of cytochrome c had a remarkable effect on pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-9 activation and resulted in the reduction of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity in Sl-1 cells undergoing apoptosis. Caspase-9 inhibitor could inhibit activation of pro-caspase-3, and the inhibition of the function of Apaf-1 with FSBA blocked apoptosis, hinting that Apaf-1 could be involved in Sl-1 cell apoptosis induced by AfMNPV. Taken together, these results strongly demonstrate that cytochrome c plays an important role in apoptotic signaling pathways in Lepidopteran insect cells."
https://openalex.org/W2061059033,"Patients with multiple myeloma commonly develop focal osteolytic bone disease, as well as generalised osteoporosis. The mechanisms underlying the development of osteoporosis in patients with myeloma are poorly understood. Although disruption of the RANKL/OPG pathway has been shown to underlie formation of focal osteolytic lesions, its role in the development of osteoporosis in myeloma remains unclear. Increased soluble RANKL in serum from patients with myeloma raises the possibility that this molecule plays a key role. The aim of the present study was to establish whether sRANKL produced by myeloma cells contributes directly to osteoporosis. C57BL/KaLwRij mice were injected with either 5T2MM or 5T33MM murine myeloma cells. 5T2MM-bearing mice developed osteolytic bone lesions (p<0.05) with increased osteoclast surface (p<0.01) and reduced trabecular bone volume (p<0.05). Bone volume was also reduced at sites where 5T2MM cells were not present (p<0.05). In 5T2MM-bearing mice soluble mRANKL was increased (p<0.05), whereas OPG was not altered. In contrast, 5T33MM-bearing mice had no changes in osteoclast surface or trabecular bone volume and did not develop osteolytic lesions. Soluble mRANKL was undetectable in serum from 5T33MM-bearing mice. In separate experiments, RPMI-8226 human myeloma cells were transduced with an human RANKL/eGFP construct, or eGFP alone. RPMI-8226/hRANKL/eGFP cells, but not RPMI-8226/eGFP cells, stimulated osteoclastic bone resorption (p<0.05) in vitro. Sub-cutaneous injection of NOD/SCID mice with RPMI-8226/hRANKL/eGFP or RPMI-8226/eGFP cells resulted in tumour development in all mice. RPMI-8226/hRANKL/eGFP-bearing mice exhibited increased serum soluble hRANKL (p<0.05) and a three-fold increase in osteoclast number (p<0.05) compared to RPMI-8226/eGFP-bearing mice. This was associated with reduced trabecular bone volume (27%, p<0.05), decreased trabecular number (29%, p<0.05) and increased trabecular thickness (8%, p<0.05). Our findings demonstrate that soluble RANKL produced by myeloma cells causes generalised bone loss, suggesting that targeting RANKL may prevent osteoporosis in patients with myeloma."
https://openalex.org/W2071217172,"Biallelic mutations in MCPH1 cause primary microcephaly (MCPH) with the cellular phenotype of defective chromosome condensation. MCPH1 encodes a multifunctional protein that notably is involved in brain development, regulation of chromosome condensation, and DNA damage response. In the present studies, we detected that MCPH1 encodes several distinct transcripts, including two major forms: full-length MCPH1 (MCPH1-FL) and a second transcript lacking the six 3′ exons (MCPH1Δe9–14). Both variants show comparable tissue-specific expression patterns, demonstrate nuclear localization that is mediated independently via separate NLS motifs, and are more abundant in certain fetal than adult organs. In addition, the expression of either isoform complements the chromosome condensation defect found in genetically MCPH1-deficient or MCPH1 siRNA-depleted cells, demonstrating a redundancy of both MCPH1 isoforms for the regulation of chromosome condensation. Strikingly however, both transcripts are regulated antagonistically during cell-cycle progression and there are functional differences between the isoforms with regard to the DNA damage response; MCPH1-FL localizes to phosphorylated H2AX repair foci following ionizing irradiation, while MCPH1Δe9–14 was evenly distributed in the nucleus. In summary, our results demonstrate here that MCPH1 encodes different isoforms that are differentially regulated at the transcript level and have different functions at the protein level."

We first selected 23 ARS/AIMPs (together referred to as ARSN), 124 cancer-associated druggable target genes (DTGs) and 404 protein-protein interactors (PPIs) of ARSs using NCI’s cancer gene index. 254 GBM affymetrix microarray data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to identify the probe sets whose expression were most strongly correlated with survival (Kaplan-Meier plots versus survival times, log-rank t-test <0.05). The analysis identified 122 probe sets as survival signatures, including 5 of ARSN (VARS, QARS, CARS, NARS, FARS), and 115 of DTGs and PPIs (PARD3, RXRB, ATP5C1, HSP90AA1, CD44, THRA, TRAF2, KRT10, MED12, etc). Of note, 61 survival-related probes were differentially expressed in three different prognosis subgroups in GBM patients and showed correlation with established prognosis markers such as age and phenotypic molecular signatures. CARS and FARS also showed significantly higher association with different molecular networks in GBM patients. Taken together, our findings demonstrate evidence for an ARSN biology-dominant contribution in the biology of GBM."

Human body temperatures induce filamentous growth in C. albicans, and this process is evoked by the release of repression by the essential molecular chaperone Hsp90 on its target proteins (22Shapiro R.S.

The effect of Hsp90 on filamentation was originally suggested to be mediated via the Ras-PKA pathway, as strains deleted for positive regulators of the pathway are unable to form filaments upon compromise of Hsp90 function by its inhibitor geldanamycin, whereas strains deleted for negative regulators easily show the morphogenetic response (22Shapiro R.S.

In the current study, we provide evidence that supports a model of regulation of heat-induced filamentation by the chemical chaperone trehalose. In this model, the Ras-PKA pathway participates in the release of function of Hsp90 by regulating trehalose content, hence providing clues on the role of the signaling pathway in the Hsp90-dependent filamentation program. Heat-induced filamentation is severely reduced by the absence of Gpr1. We show that this defect is caused by increased intracellular trehalose content. In addition, validamycin, a trehalose analog, promotes trehalose accumulation and blocks filamentation in response to heat and geldanymycin. Our results clearly establish trehalose as a negative regulator of the heat-induced cell elongation program. All C. albicans and S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Under continuous shaking, C. albicans strains were grown at 37 °C, S. cerevisiae strains were grown at 30 °C.

For determination of glucose uptake, cells were harvested and washed with 25 mm MES buffer (pH 6) and resuspended in buffer at 80 mg of cells, wet weight, per ml. 40 μl of cell suspension was preincubated at 30 °C. 10 μl of [14C]glucose was added to the appropriate final concentration at a specific activity of 500 cpm/nmol of glucose. After 1 min, 5 ml of ice-cold water was added, and the cells were filtered through a glass microfiber filter (Whatman GF/C) prewet with the unlabeled glucose solution at the same concentration and immediately washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold water. For each determination, three samples and two blank samples were taken. 10 μl of the labeled glucose solution was used to determine the specific activity. The radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter LS6500). Transport activity is expressed as nmol of glucose min−1 (g dry weight)−1.

For determination of extracellular trehalose content, the Waters Breeze HPLC (Waters Corporation) was used. Samples were taken over time, and cells were centrifuged and discarded. Extracellular medium was used in the analysis. Samples were analyzed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, using 5 mm H2SO4 as eluant. Results were processed with the Breeze software. Trehalose content was determined as mm trehalose. Trehalase activity was determined as described previously (27Pernambuco M.B. Winderickx J. Crauwels M. Griffioen G. Mager W.H. Thevelein J.M.

For TPS and TPP activity determination, cells were harvested at indicated time points and washed with and extracted in 50 mm imidazole (pH 6.3) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor and desalted on Sephadex columns. For TPS activity determinations, samples were added to an assay mixture solution, containing (at final concentration) 40 mm Tricine (pH 7), 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm uridine diphosphoglucose, and 8 mm glucose 6-phosphate. In the control samples, glucose 6-phosphate was omitted. Formed trehalose 6-phosphate was determined by the addition of phosphoenolpyruvate, NADH, and lactate dehydrogenase and measured as a difference in A340 nm before and after addition of pyruvate kinase. The amount of protein in the samples was determined as described by Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent.J. Biol.

Cells were observed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope, and images were captured with an Axio-Cam HRm camera by using Axiovision 3.0 software (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent method. Complementary DNA was prepared from DNase-treated RNA samples with a Reverse Transcription kit (Promega). Quantitative PCR was performed using a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were prepared with the Kapa SYBR Fast kit (Kapabiosystem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The -fold regulation of the target gene was calculated using the comparative Ct method, using TEF1 Ct to normalize the data. Previous findings have shown that absence of GPR1 in C. albicans leads to increased trehalose content as well as activity of the Tps1 enzyme, especially in heat shock conditions (30Maidan M.M. De Rop L. Relloso M. Diez-Orejas R. Thevelein J.M. Van Dijck P. Combined inactivation of the Candida albicans GPR1 TPS2 genes results in avirulence in a mouse model for systemic infection.Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We investigated the role of Gpr1 on trehalose content in C. albicans in conditions of 37 °C, the physiological temperature that is not experienced as a stress in the pathogenic fungus. Deletion of GPR1 resulted in increased levels of trehalose in exponentially growing cells (Fig. 1A), a growth phase during which trehalose does not normally accumulate. Significantly higher amounts of trehalose were measured in the deleted strain compared with wild type and GPR1-reintegrant strains. This peculiar accumulation occurred in glucose-containing growth conditions, however not in glycerol-containing media (data not shown). Defective export of trehalose in the surrounding medium was ruled out by HPLC analysis, which showed equal amounts of trehalose accumulating in the medium for all strains (data not shown). Higher trehalose content in the gpr1Δ/gpr1Δ strain did not impair the carbohydrate mobilization upon addition of glucose to sugar-deprived cells (Fig. 1B). We speculated that activation of trehalase, the enzyme that breaks down molecules of trehalose into glucose, would therefore occur prior to mobilization. Reports on neutral trehalase activity in C. albicans exist (31Eck R. Bergmann C. Ziegelbauer K. Schönfeld W. Künkel W. A neutral trehalase gene from Candida albicans: molecular cloning, characterization and disruption.Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3747-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but activation by resupplementation of missing nutrients has never been documented. In wild type S. cerevisiae, activation of neutral trehalase could be observed 2–5 min after glucose addition (Fig. 1C). However, only basal trehalase activity and no activation could be detected in C. albicans strains. Gpr1 in C. albicans is required to control basal trehalose levels in particular when cells are metabolically active and growing in favorable conditions. Absence of the receptor seems to mimic a nutrient-poor environment for the cells, leading to trehalose accumulation. However, Gpr1 does not play a role in the induction of trehalose breakdown, typically observed upon sugar addition, which differs from the situation in S. cerevisiae. The substrates of trehalose are uridine diphosphoglucose and glucose 6-phosphate. They are converted into trehalose 6-phosphate in the first step of trehalose accumulation by the Tps1 enzyme (11Reinders A. Bürckert N. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Boller T. Wiemken A. De Virgilio C. Structural analysis of the subunits of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and their function during heat shock.Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We aimed at determining whether increased trehalose content in gpr1Δ/gpr1Δ cells correlated with increased levels of glucose or glucose 6-phosphate. In none of the assays we performed we could detect a lower or higher level of these substrates in cells lacking GPR1, either before or after induction with glucose (Fig. 2). Specifically, Gpr1 does not play a role in the transport of glucose (Fig. 2A), and it does not control the rise of glucose phosphorylation following glucose addition (Fig. 2B). The transient increase of glucose 6-phosphate coincides with a drop of ATP levels, which was observed in both wild type and GPR1-deleted strains (Fig. 2C). The up-regulated conversion to trehalose could mask any increased glucose 6-phosphate production, possibly resulting from elevated hexokinase activity. However, the total hexo- and glucokinase activities were not significantly different between the two strains (Fig. 2D). Although these data were required to determine possible routes of regulation of trehalose metabolism via Gpr1, they evidently suggest other level(s) of regulation, one of them being the regulation of the trehalose synthesis enzymes, Tps1 and Tps2. We measured TPS and TPP activities, the two main enzymatic activities responsible for trehalose synthesis, in C. albicans cells growing in glucose-containing medium for 3–72 h. A sharp rise in TPS activity was observed in gpr1Δ/gpr1Δ cells at 9 and 24 h of growth, coinciding with increased trehalose content at the same time of growth (Fig. 3A). The dephosphorylation step of trehalose 6-phosphate into trehalose by TPP was somewhat increased as well, but statistical significance could never be obtained (Fig. 3B). The steadily increased TPP activity is likely necessary to ensure trehalose 6-phosphate to be continuously converted into trehalose, as accumulation of this intermediate molecule is toxic to cells (19Van Dijck P. De Rop L. Szlufcik K. Van Ael E. Thevelein J.M. Disruption of the Candida albicans TPS2 gene encoding trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase decreases infectivity without affecting hypha formation.Infect.

Transcriptional regulation of the TPS1 gene was not modulated differentially in wild type and gpr1Δ/gpr1Δ cells (data not shown), suggesting a post-translational regulatory mechanism. An increase of trehalose content in C. albicans is mostly accompanied by a decrease in neutral trehalase activity, at least as a response to heat or oxidative stress (33Pedreño Y. González-Párraga P.

However, biopsychosocial case complexity may also affect patient health outcome but has not yet been explored in this setting. Therefore, the aims of the study are (1) to estimate prevalence rates of complex patients in the emergency room (ER), (2) to describe biopsychosocial complexity in this population and (3) to evaluate possible correlations between patient profiles regarding case complexity and further clinical treatment. Methods During a study period of one week, all patients of an emergency room of internal medicine who were triaged to Manchester levels three to five were invited to participate in the study. Biopsychosocial case complexity was assessed by the INTERMED method. Psychosocial interventions were evaluated based on all documented interventions and recommendations given at the emergency room and during inpatient treatment. Results Study participants consisted of 167 patients with a subgroup of 19% (n = 32) receiving subsequent inpatient-treatment at the department. High biopsychosocial case complexity was found in 12% (n = 20) of the total sample (INTERMED score >20). This finding was paralleled by a cluster analysis suggesting three clusters with one highly complex patient group of 14%. These highly complex patients differed significantly from the other clusters as they had visited the emergency room more often within the last year and lived alone more frequently. In addition, admission rates were highest in this group. During ER treatment and subsequent inpatient treatment, 21% of highly complex patients received interventions addressing psychosocial factors as compared to 6% and 7%, respectively, in the other clusters. Conclusions A standardized screening of biopsychosocial case complexity among ‘frequent utilizers’ of the ER would be helpful to detect specific multidisciplinary health care needs among this particularly burdened patient group."

The crystal structures of Gα(i)·GDP in complex with LGN GL3 and GL4, respectively, reveal distinct GL/Gα(i) interaction features when compared with the only high resolution structure known with GL/Gα(i) interaction between RGS14 and Gα(i1.) Only a few residues C-terminal to the conserved GL sequence are required for LGN GLs to bind to Gα(i)·GDP. A highly conserved ""double Arg finger"" sequence (RΨ(D/E)(D/E)QR) is responsible for LGN GL to bind to GDP bound to Gα(i). Together with the sequence alignment, we suggest that the LGN GL/Gα(i) interaction represents a general binding mode between GL motifs and Gα(i).

Enzyme replacement therapy has been used to treat mucopolysaccharidoses; however, neuropathology has remained refractory to this approach. To test directly whether substrate reduction might be feasible for treating MPS disease, we developed a genetic model for substrate reduction therapy by crossing MPS IIIa mice with animals partially deficient in heparan sulfate biosynthesis due to heterozygosity in Ext1 and Ext2, genes that encode the copolymerase required for heparan sulfate chain assembly. Reduction of heparan sulfate by 30-50% using this genetic strategy ameliorated the amount of disease-specific biomarker and pathology in multiple tissues, including the brain. In addition, we were able to demonstrate that substrate reduction therapy can improve the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy in cell culture and in mice. These results provide proof of principle that targeted inhibition of heparan sulfate biosynthetic enzymes together with enzyme replacement might prove beneficial for treating mucopolysaccharidoses."
https://openalex.org/W1997493309,"People living in endemic areas often habour several malaria infections at once. High-resolution genotyping can distinguish between infections by detecting the presence of different alleles at a polymorphic locus. However the number of infections may not be accurately counted since parasites from multiple infections may carry the same allele. We use simulation to determine the circumstances under which the number of observed genotypes are likely to be substantially less than the number of infections present and investigate the performance of two methods for estimating the numbers of infections from high-resolution genotyping data. The simulations suggest that the problem is not substantial in most datasets: the disparity between the mean numbers of infections and of observed genotypes was small when there was 20 or more alleles, 20 or more blood samples, a mean number of infections of 6 or less and where the frequency of the most common allele was no greater than 20%. The issue of multiple infections carrying the same allele is unlikely to be a major component of the errors in PCR-based genotyping. Simulations also showed that, with heterogeneity in allele frequencies, the observed frequencies are not a good approximation of the true allele frequencies. The first method that we proposed to estimate the numbers of infections assumes that they are a good approximation and hence did poorly in the presence of heterogeneity. In contrast, the second method by Li et al estimates both the numbers of infections and the true allele frequencies simultaneously and produced accurate estimates of the mean number of infections."
https://openalex.org/W1965461104,"ARHGAP22 is a RhoGAP protein comprising an N-terminal PH domain, a RhoGAP domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. It has recently been identified as an Akt substrate that binds 14-3-3 proteins in response to treatment with growth factors involved in cell migration. We used a range of biophysical techniques to investigate the weak interaction between 14-3-3 and a truncated form of ARHGAP22 lacking the coiled-coil domain. This weak interaction could be stabilized by chemical cross-linking which we used to show that: a monomer of ARHGAP22 binds a dimer of 14-3-3; the ARHGAP22 PH domain is required for the 14-3-3 interaction; the RhoGAP domain is unlikely to participate in the interaction; Ser16 is the more important of two predicted 14-3-3 binding sites; and, phosphorylation of Ser16 may not be necessary for 14-3-3 interaction under the conditions we used. Small angle X-ray scattering and cross-link information were used to generate solution structures of the isolated proteins and of the cross-linked ARHGAP22:14-3-3 complex, showing that no major rearrangement occurs in either protein upon binding, and supporting a role for the PH domain and N-terminal peptide of ARHGAP22 in the 14-3-3 interaction.

However, obtaining mature and functional erythrocytes from the immature cell cultures with high purity and in an efficient manner remains a significant challenge. A distinguishing feature of a reticulocyte and maturing erythrocyte is the increasing concentration of hemoglobin and decreasing cell volume that results in increased cell magnetophoretic mobility (MM) when exposed to high magnetic fields and gradients, under anoxic conditions. Taking advantage of these initial observations, we studied a noninvasive (label-free) magnetic separation and analysis process to enrich and identify cultured functional erythrocytes. In addition to the magnetic cell separation and cell motion analysis in the magnetic field, the cell cultures were characterized for cell sedimentation rate, cell volume distributions using differential interference microscopy, immunophenotyping (glycophorin A), hemoglobin concentration and shear-induced deformability (elongation index, EI, by ektacytometry) to test for mature erythrocyte attributes. A commercial, packed column high-gradient magnetic separator (HGMS) was used for magnetic separation. The magnetically enriched fraction comprised 80% of the maturing cells (predominantly reticulocytes) that showed near 70% overlap of EI with the reference cord blood-derived RBC and over 50% overlap with the adult donor RBCs. The results demonstrate feasibility of label-free magnetic enrichment of erythrocyte fraction of CD34+ progenitor-derived cultures based on the presence of paramagnetic hemoglobin in the maturing erythrocytes."

Trehalose has a significant beneficial effect in preserving the developmental potential of mouse sperm following partial desiccation and storage at temperatures above freezing. Using multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry, we are able to image and measure trehalose in individual spermatozoa. We provide the first evidence that trehalose penetrates the nucleus of a mammalian cell, permitting tolerance to desiccation. These results have broad implications for long-term storage of mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2033695240,"Human DNA ligase I (hLigI) joins Okazaki fragments during DNA replication and completes excision repair via interactions with proliferating cell nuclear antigen and replication factor C (RFC). Unlike proliferating cell nuclear antigen, the interaction with RFC is regulated by hLigI phosphorylation. To identity of the site(s) involved in this regulation, we analyzed phosphorylated hLigI purified from insect cells by mass spectrometry. These results suggested that serine 51 phosphorylation negatively regulates the interaction with RFC. Therefore, we constructed versions of hLigI in which serine 51 was replaced with either alanine (hLigI51A) to prevent phosphorylation or aspartic acid (hLigI51D) to mimic phosphorylation. hLigI51D but not hLigI51A was defective in binding to purified RFC and in associating with RFC in cell extracts. Although DNA synthesis and proliferation of hLigI-deficient cells expressing either hLig51A or hLig51 was reduced compared with cells expressing wild-type hLigI, cellular senescence was only observed in the cells expressing hLigI51D. Notably, these cells had increased levels of spontaneous DNA damage and phosphorylated CHK2. In addition, although expression of hLigI51A complemented the sensitivity of hLigI-deficient cells to a poly (ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, expression of hLig151D did not, presumably because these cells are more dependent upon PARP-dependent repair pathways to repair the damage resulting from the abnormal DNA replication. Finally, neither expression of hLigI51D nor hLigI51A fully complemented the sensitivity of hLigI-deficient cells to DNA alkylation. Thus, phosphorylation of serine 51 on hLigI plays a critical role in regulating the interaction between hLigI and RFC, which is required for efficient DNA replication and repair."
https://openalex.org/W2016618197,"Mgm101 is a Rad52-type recombination protein of bacteriophage origin required for the repair and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). It forms large oligomeric rings of ∼14-fold symmetry that catalyze the annealing of single-stranded DNAs in vitro. In this study, we investigated the structural elements that contribute to this distinctive higher order structural organization and examined its functional implications. A pair of vicinal cysteines, Cys-216 and Cys-217, was found to be essential for mtDNA maintenance. Mutations to the polar serine, the negatively charged aspartic and glutamic acids, and the hydrophobic amino acid alanine all destabilize mtDNA in vivo. The alanine mutants have an increased propensity of forming macroscopic filaments. In contrast, mutations to aspartic acid drastically destabilize the protein and result in unstructured aggregates with severely reduced DNA binding activity. Interestingly, the serine mutants partially disassemble the Mgm101 rings into smaller oligomers. In the case of the C216S mutant, a moderate increase in DNA binding activity was observed. By using small angle x-ray scattering analysis, we found that Mgm101 forms rings of ∼200 Å diameter in solution, consistent with the structure previously established by transmission electron microscopy. We also found that the C216A/C217A double mutant tends to form broken rings, which likely provide free ends for seeding the growth of the super-stable but functionally defective filaments. Taken together, our data underscore the importance of a delicately maintained ring structure critical for Mgm101 activity. We discuss a potential role of Cys-216 and Cys-217 in regulating Mgm101 function and the repair of damaged mtDNA under stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2076632541,"Infection and transmission of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-Mtb) and extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis (XDR-Mtb) is a serious health problem. We analyzed a total of 1,110 Mtb isolates in Osaka Prefecture and neighboring areas from April 2000 to March 2009. A total of 89 MDR-Mtb were identified, 36 (48.5%) of which were determined to be XDR-Mtb. Among the 89 MDR-Mtb isolates, 24 (27.0%) phylogenetically distributed into six clusters based on mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-various number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) typing. Among these six clusters, the MIRU-VNTR patterns of four (OM-V02, OM-V03, OM-V04, and OM-V06) were only found for MDR-Mtb. Further analysis revealed that all isolates belonging to OM-V02 and OM-V03, and two isolates from OM-V04 were clonal. Importantly such genotypes were not observed for drug-sensitive isolates. These suggest that few but transmissible clones can transmit after acquiring multidrug resistance and colonize even in a country with a developed, well-organized healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W1972049362,"Background Rule-based Modeling (RBM) is a computer simulation modeling methodology already used to model infectious diseases. Extending this technique to the assessment of chronic diseases, mixing quantitative and qualitative data appear to be a promising alternative to classical methods. Elderly depression reveals an important source of comorbidities. Yet, the intertwined relationship between late-life events and the social support of the elderly person remains difficult to capture. We illustrate the usefulness of RBM in modeling chronic diseases using the example of elderly depression in Belgium. Methods We defined a conceptual framework of interactions between late-life events and social support impacting elderly depression. This conceptual framework was underpinned by experts' opinions elicited through a questionnaire. Several scenarios were implemented successively to better mimic the real population, and to explore a treatment effect and a socio-economic distinction. The simulated patterns of depression by age were compared with empirical patterns retrieved from the Belgian Health Interview Survey. Results Simulations were run using different groupings of experts' opinions on the parameters. The results indicate that the conceptual framework can reflect a realistic evolution of the prevalence of depression. Indeed, simulations combining the opinions of well-selected experts and a treatment effect showed no significant difference with the empirical pattern. Conclusions Our conceptual framework together with a quantification of parameters through elicited expert opinions improves the insights into possible dynamics driving elderly depression. While RBM does not require high-level skill in mathematics or computer programming, the whole implementation process provides a powerful tool to learn about complex chronic diseases, combining advantages of both quantitative and qualitative approaches."
https://openalex.org/W1976868567,"Placental malaria is a significant cause of all malaria-related deaths globally for which no drugs have been developed to specifically disrupt its pathogenesis. To facilitate the discovery of antimalarial drugs targeting the cytoadherence process of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes in the placenta microvasculature, we have developed an automated image-based assay for high-throughput screening for potent cytoadherence inhibitors in vitro. Parasitized erythrocytes were drug-treated for 24 h and then allowed to adhere on a monolayer of placental BeWo cells prior to red blood cell staining with glycophorin A antibodies. Upon image-acquisition, drug effects were quantified as the proportion of treated parasitized erythrocytes to BeWo cells compared to the binding of untreated iRBCs. We confirmed the reliability of this new assay by comparing the binding ratios of CSA- and CD36-panned parasites on the placental BeWo cells, and by quantifying the effects of chondroitin sulfate A, brefeldin A, and artemisinin on the binding. By simultaneously examining the drug effects on parasite viability, we could discriminate between cytoadherence-specific inhibitors and other schizonticidal compounds. Taken together, our data establish that the developed assay is highly suitable for drug studies targeting placental malaria, and will facilitate the discovery and rapid development of new therapies against malaria."
