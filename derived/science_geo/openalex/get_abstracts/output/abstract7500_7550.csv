https://openalex.org/W2116951270,"A series of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) deletion, insertion and substitution mutants, some of which are defective for transformation of rat cells, have been isolated. The mutants were selected as variants which lack the Xba I endonuclease cleavage site at 4 map units on the viral chromosome. The deletions range in size from 150-2300 bp and are located between 1.5 and 10.5 map units. The mutants can be propagated in 293 cells (Ad5-transformed human embryonic kidney cells), but are defective for growth in HeLa or human embryonic kidney cells. No viral DNA synthesis was observed in mutant virus-infected HeLa cells. All but one of the deletion mutants tested were defective for transformation of rat embryo and rat embryo brain cells."

Naming, reading, short-term verbal memory, single and sequential orofacial movements, and phoneme identification were tested. Sequential orofacial movements and phoneme identification were altered from the same brain sites and thus identified a common system for language production and understanding. This system surrounded a final motor pathway for speech and was surrounded by a separate short-term verbal-memory system. Between the sequential motor-phoneme identification and memory systems were sites where only naming or reading were altered, including sites related exclusively by syntax."
https://openalex.org/W2003383185,"Abstract Both DNA and the centriole pairs are replicated once in each cell generation. The cyclic changes in both must be coordinated so that the two centriole pairs can participate in mitosis when the genetic material is to be partitioned to the two daughter cells. One of the centriole pairs also forms a primary (9 + 0) cilium sometime during the cell cycle. In this study, we asked whether some aspects of the coordination of the DNA and centriole cycles occur in G 1 , a part of the cell cycle when non-neoplastic cells become irreversibly committed to DNA synthesis. We used indirect immunofluorescence with antitubulin antibody to reveal the centriole pairs as a microtubule organizing center with or without a cilium. Quiescent Balb/c and Swiss 3T3 cells in low serum or at high cell density stopped in G 1 with ciliated, probably unduplicated centrioles. When these quiescent 3T3 cells were stimulated to enter DNA synthesis, the centriole's ciliation changed in three phases: first, an initial but transient deciliation within 1–2 hr; second, a return of the cilium by 6–8 hr; and third, a subsequent final deciliation of the centriole coincident with the initiation of DNA synthesis at 12–24 hr. The deciliated and duplicated centrioles subsequently separated in preparation for mitosis. Together with other information, these results imply that centrioles in growing mammalian cells are primarily ciliated in a part of G 1 during which the cells can arrest in suboptimal environmental conditions. Arrests in low serum or at high cell density also occur before centriole replication. These results suggest that deciliation and duplication of the centriole may occur near the time that quiescent cells become irreversibly committed to DNA synthesis. Certain centriole events may therefore be necessary before DNA synthesis can be initiated in 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1976109055,"The magnitude of task-evoked pupillary dilations during mental activity has previously been shown to index the cognitive capacity utilized in the performance of the mental task. To determine the relation between ""intelligence"" and capacity demands during mental activity, task-evoked pupillary dilations were measured while two groups of university students differing in their scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test solved mental arithmetic problems. Over three levels of problem difficulty, more intelligent subjects showed smaller task-evoked pupillary dilations than did their less intelligent counterparts. Thus, the more intelligent appear to possess more efficient cognitive structures of information processing. These data provide evidence that physiological differences between individuals of differing psychometric intelligence emerge during mental activity."

When blood pressure was raised by an infusion of phenylephrine, rats showed less running to terminate or avoid noxious stimuli than during saline infusions. This effect was not seen in rats with denervated baroreceptors. The results suggest that a rise of blood pressure could have motivational consequences significant for human hypertension."

https://openalex.org/W1996710832,"The subfornical organ, a circumventricular structure of the central nervous system, has efferent neural projections to sites within the brain known to be involved in drinking behavior and secretion of antidiuretic hormone. By using anterograde tracing techniques, it is shown that the subfornical organ projects to the nucleus medianus of the medial preoptic area, to the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, and to the supraoptic nuclei bilaterally. Its efferent connectivity is confirmed by retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. The organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, another circumventricular organ and a suspected receptor site for angiotensin II, is involved in the circuitry of the subfornical organ and also has an efferent projection to the supraoptic nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W2139040913,Exposure of L1210 leukemia cells first to 0.1 to 100 micromolar methotrexate and then to 10 micromolar 5-fluorouracil produces a synergistic effect on the number of cells killed in culture. Methotrexate dose-related increases occur in the concentrations of intracellular 5-fluorouracil ribonucleotides and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate and in the incorporation of 5-fluorouracil into RNA. These increases are correlated with increased concentrations of intracellular phosphoribosylpyrophosphate. It is proposed that the enhanced formation of ribonucleotides of 5-fluorouracil and the subsequent incorporation of these compounds into RNA in methotrexate-treated cells may account for synergism between these agents.

Probably the result of inhibitory interactions, this mutual repulsion occurs at a central site in the visual system and may normally enhance discrimination of direction."
https://openalex.org/W1989198443,"When pyramidal tract axons are cut in the adult hamster, fibers degenerate in both anterograde and retrograde directions from the lesion. If the same operation is performed on infant hamsters, however, there is massive regrowth of the severed axons via a new brainstem pathway to their appropriate terminal sites in the medulla and spinal cord. In contrast to previous studies, these results suggest that axons in the mammalian central nervous system damaged early in life may regenerate in a functionally useful way."

https://openalex.org/W2060355791,"A direct method has been employed to estimate the rate of production by human brain of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol, the major metabolite of brain norepinephrine, a brain neurotransmitter. Venous specimens were obtained from the internal jugular vein from ten awake human subjects at a puncture site above the common facial vein, the first major source of extracranial inflow. Arterial specimens were simultaneously obtained from the radial artery. Plasma samples were assayed and a highly significant difference was found in the concentration of the metabolite in plasma coming out of the brain (venous blood) as compared to plasma entering the brain (arterial blood). This venous-arterial difference was calculated to be 0.7 +/- 0.1 nanogram per milliliter of blood. Assuming an adult brain weight of 1400 grams and normal cerebral blood flow, it is estimated that the rate of production of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol by the awake human brain is approximately 597 nanograms per minute or 35.8 micrograms per hour. Urine specimens were also collected from six of these subjects during a period of 1 to 3.5 hours, which bracketed the time the blood samples were obtained. For these six subjects the output of 3-methyoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol by whole brain was estimated to be 40.9 micrograms per hour, whereas the rate of its excretion into urine was 64.5 micrograms per hour."
https://openalex.org/W2011622685,"The state of chick embryo chondroblasts in culture was found to be sensitive to both fibronectin and another substance(s) (activity A) which could be extracted from chick embryo fibroblasts with 1 M urea or from conditioned medium. In the presence of either of these activities at concentrations of 25-150 micrograms/ml, chondroblasts, which normally grow as mixed cultures of floating and adherent cells, all immediately became attached to the tissue culture dish and spread. After several days, the morphology of these typically epithelioid cells became fibroblastic. This did not involve a selection process, since the effect was reversible. The synthetic program of these cells was also dramatically modified: the cultures no longer synthesized the chondroblast-unique type IV sulfated proteoglycan and began synthesizing alpha 2 collagen chains typical of fibroblastic or early limb bud cells. Fibronectin was resolved from activity A by gelatin affinity chromatography or gel filtration. Both activities were trypsin-sensitive. The two activities differed, however, on the basis of how the protein fractions in which they were found migrated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, their specific activities and their effects on cell morphology and cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1977962111,"Three psychotropic drugs were administered to pregnant rats and were then evaluated for their behavioral and reproductive effects in the offspring. Control rats received either saline or vitamin A. Prochlorperazine had the most disruptive effects on reproduction and growth, but had the least effect on behavior. Propoxyphene had no apparent effects on reproduction or growth, but produced a variety of behavioral changes. Fenfluramine was intermediate in its effects on reproduction and growth and had behavioral effects that were revealed in tests of preweaning development. The data suggest that systematic tests of behavior add important information to evaluations of reproductive toxicity that cannot, at present, be obtained by other means."

https://openalex.org/W2144667682,"When human lymphoblastoid mRNA was microinjected into X. laevis oocytes, titers of interferon rapidly reached a maximum inside the oocyte while accumulation of interferon continued in the incubation medium for at least 45 hr. If interferon protein was injected into oocytes it was rapidly inactivated. Significantly, newly synthesized interferon but not injected interferon was found to be membrane-associated. Further experiments involving the co-injection of mRNAs coding for secretory proteins (guinea pig milk proteins and human interferon) and nonsecretory proteins (rabbit globin) revealed that only the secretory proteins were exported from the oocyte. Moreover, different proteins were exported at different rates. A distinct subclass of newly synthesized oocyte proteins of unknown function also accumulated in the incubation medium. Since the information encoded in the messenger RNAs of secretory proteins is sufficient to specify synthesis, compartmentation and secretion of these proteins, the oocyte may provide a complete system for the analysis of the secretory process."

https://openalex.org/W1995045871,"Abstract Studies reported in the preceding paper (Trowbridge and Hyman, 1979) have demonstrated that Thy-1 − mutant lymphoma cells of the class E complementation group lack the normal high molecular weight lipid-linked oligosaccharide, but instead accumulate two smaller species termed I and II. This paper reports studies which elucidate the structures of lipid-linked oligosaccharides I and II. By subjecting oligosaccharides radiolabeled with 3 H-mannose, 3 H-glucose or 3 H-glucosamine to methylation, acetolysis, periodate oxidation and exoglycosidase digestion, the structures were shown to be: where R=GlcNac B1,4(3) GlcNAc. A comparison of I and II with lipid-linked oligosaccharides from normal Chinese hamster ovary cells indicates that both I and II are normal biosynthetic intermediates. On the basis of these data we suggest that the defect in the class E mutant cells is the lack of an α1,3 mannosyltransferase involved in the conversion of the Man 5 GlcNAc 2 lipid-linked oligosaccharide to the Man 6 GlcNAc 2 intermediate. It is also impossible that the same enzyme is involved in conversion of the Glc 3 Man 5 GlcNAc 2 lipid-linked oligosaccharide to Glc 3 Man 6 GlcNAc 2 . The latter reaction, however, has not yet been demonstrated in normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2005570145,"Teratocarcinoma stem cells maintained in the undifferentiated state express a carbohydrate-binding component that recognizes oligomannosyl residues. This cell surface molecule is detected by a rosette assay in which the stem cells form rosettes with glutaraldehyde-fixed trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes. Addition of simple sugars to the assay mixture has little effect, but rosette formation is inhibited by a series of mannose-rich glycoproteins (yeast invertase, yeast mannans and horseradish peroxidase). Periodate oxidation eliminates the inhibitory activity of invertase whereas pronase digestion has little effect, indicating that carbohydrate moieties are essential for inhibition. Invertase and its glycopeptide derivatives also inhibit the reaggregation of dispersed stem cells and promote the dissociation of preformed aggregates. These results suggest that intercellular adhesion of teratocarcinoma stem cells may be the consequence of the interaction of a lectin-like component detected in the rosette assay with a complementary oligosaccharide receptor on adjacent cells."

https://openalex.org/W2035897791,"A cloned line of undifferentiated teratocarcinoma cells (OC15S1) was either maintained as a homogeneous embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell population or was cultured under conditions where the cells differentiated into endoderm-like (END) cells. In this study we examine the synthesis of collagen in both EC and END cells. Cell cultures were incubated with tritiated proline and lysine, and the radioactive collagen secreted into the medium was extracted and purified or immunoprecipitated by antibodies to type IV collagen ( Adamson and Ayers, 1979 Adamson E.D. Ayers S.E. The localization and synthesis of some collagen types in developing mouse embryos. Cell. 1979; 16: 953-965 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar ). Radioactive collagens were identified by electrophoretic mobility, by sensitivity to collagenase and to reduction, by insensitivity to pepsin, by cyanogen bromide peptides, and by aminoacid analyses of 3-hydroxyproline, 4-hydroxyproline and proline. OC15S1 EC cells were found to synthesize several collagenous polypeptides, of which 60–70% of the radioactivity was like that of basement membrane (type IV) collagen. Type I-like collagen was the main collagenous product of END cells, but a minor product of EC cells. We concluded that type IV collagen synthesis was suppressed during the differentiation of EC cells to END, while type I-like synthesis was increased. Similarly, other EC cell lines produced mainly type IV-like collagen polypeptides (PC13, F9, PSA1), and following the formation of END cells, two lines produced mainly type I-like collagen polypeptides (PC13, C145b). The type of endoderm formed on embryoid bodies, however, presents an alternate route of differentiation, since immunoperoxidase tests showed that it was synthesizing significant amounts of type IV collagen. We discuss the significance of these findings in relation to a similar change which occurs during normal development."

https://openalex.org/W2168963461,"Sulfur functions in position 8 of the flavin nucleus give rise to new modified flavin derivatives, which should prove useful as probes of the flavin binding domains of flavoproteins. Here, we report on some properties of 8-nor-8-alkylmercaptoflavins and 8-nor-8-mercaptoflavin which are readily formed by nucleophilic displacement by alkylmercaptides or sulfide, with 8-nor-8-chloroflavins as starting material. The new flavins are characterized by extensive shifts in spectral properties, with very high extinction coefficients. 8-nor-8-mercaptoriboflavin is easily and reversibly converted to its (-S-S-) dimer. Oxidation of the sulfur group by peracids forms first sulfoxides and then sulfones, in which the characteristic usual flavin spectrum is regained.

Immunoreactivity in 98 schizophrenic patients did not differ greatly from that in 42 normal subjects. No immunoreactivity was detectable in dialyzates from first-time hemodialysis of eight nonpsychotic renal patients and nine schizophrenic patients. These results are not compatible with recent reports of extremely high concentrations of [Leu5]-beta-endorphin in hemodialyzates from schizophrenic patients.
https://openalex.org/W2007284305,"Inversion, the process by which Volvox embryos turn inside out, was analyzed by a combination of geometrical and experimental techniques. It was shown that simple geometric figures are adequate to represent cell shapes during inversion and that cell volumes remain constant as cell shapes change and the embryo inverts. The first stage of inversion, phialopore opening, results from the release of compressive forces as the embryo withdraws from its surrounding vesicle during a two-stage contraction of each cell around its radial axis. Premature phialopore opening occurs when withdrawal of the embryo from the vesicle is elicited artificially by exposure to either calcium ionophore or hypertonic solutions. The major event of inversion, generation of negative curvature, requires both microtubule-driven elongation of cells (to produce a classical “flask” shape) and cytochalasin-sensitive active migration of cytoplasmic bridges to the outermost ends of flask cells. Colchicine, cyclic GMP and isobutyl methyl xanthine (individually) block both normal elongation and bridge migration; cytochalasin D blocks bridge migration selectively. Flask cell formation and bridge migration are adequate to account for the negative curvature observed. An asymmetric bending of flask cell stalks along the ring of maximum curvature accounts for the fact that the embryo is not constricted in a “purse-string” fashion as negative curvature is generated. Inversion of the posterior hemisphere involves an elastic snap-through resulting from a combination of compressive stresses generated by inversion of the anterior hemisphere and the circumferential restraint imposed by cells at the equator. We conclude that the observed changes in cell shape and the migration of cytoplasmic bridges are the result of an ordered process of membrane-cytoskeletal interactions, and both necessary and sufficient to account for the morphogenetic process of inversion in Volvox."

Both oligosaccharides were smaller than the lipid-linkid oligosaccharides of wild-type lymphomas and, in contrast to the lipid-linked oligosaccharides isolated from wild-type cells, both were resistant to digestion with endoglycosidase H. The oligosaccharides of newly synthesized polypeptides in class E Thy-1-cells were also resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion, providing strong evidence that they are derived from the abnormal lipid-linked oligosaccharides."

https://openalex.org/W1565272459,"Hirudin inhibited the binding of human 125I-alpha-thrombin to the saturable, but not the nonsaturable, sites on washed human platelets. When hirudin was added to a thrombin-platelet mixture, it caused a biphasic dissociation of bound thrombin. A partial dissociation was too rapid to measure and was followed by complete dissociation with a first order rate constant of about 10(-2) s-1. The fraction of bound thrombin in the more slowly dissociable form increased from essentially none after a 5-s preincubation of thrombin and platelets to as much as 75% of saturable binding after a 4-min preincubation. Transition to the slowly dissociable state was not accompanied by an increase in the amount bound and was not observed with active site serine-derivatized thrombin. This is the first evidence with intact platelets of a binding characteristic that depends, as does platelet stimulation, on catalytically active thrombin, suggesting that it may represent physiologically significant receptor processing."

https://openalex.org/W1596192073,"Glucagon administration to the intact rat has been shown to stimulate pyruvate metabolism in liver mitochondria, presumably by increasing pyruvate transport into the organelle. In this report, we used alanine in place of pyruvate to examine the possibility that glucagon might stimulate pyruvate carboxylation per se independent of its postulated action on pyruvate transport. In agreement with previous reports, injection of a low dose of glucagon (50 micrograms/kg of rat) increased respiration, ATP synthesis, pyruvate decarboxylation, and CO2 fixation in liver mitochondria subsequently isolated. When alanine was used as a substrate, CO2 fixation, but not decarboxylation, was increased in liver mitochondria isolated from glucagon-treated rats. Pyruvate accumulation under these conditions was significantly lower in the glucagon-treated rat preparation. When mitochondria were incubated in a HCO3- -deficient buffer, pyruvate accumulation was identical in both preparations. The addition of a pyruvate transport inhibitor, alpha-cyanohydroxycinnamate (0.5 mM), inhibited CO2 fixation with pyruvate by 70%, but had no effect when alanine was used. Our data therefore suggest that glucagon stimluates mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylation independent of its possible action on pyruvate transport."
