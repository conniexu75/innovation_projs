https://openalex.org/W2141819495,"Exosomes are small vesicles (50-150 nm) of endocytic origin that are released by many different cell types. Exosomes in the tumor microenvironment may play a key role in facilitating cell-cell communication. Exosomes are reported to predominantly contain RNA and proteins. In this study, we investigated whether exosomes from pancreatic cancer cells and serum from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma contain genomic DNA. Our results provide evidence that exosomes contain >10-kb fragments of double-stranded genomic DNA. Mutations in KRAS and p53 can be detected using genomic DNA from exosomes derived from pancreatic cancer cell lines and serum from patients with pancreatic cancer. In addition, using whole genome sequencing, we demonstrate that serum exosomes from patients with pancreatic cancer contain genomic DNA spanning all chromosomes. These results indicate that serum-derived exosomes can be used to determine genomic DNA mutations for cancer prediction, treatment, and therapy resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1989853799,"Neutrophils represent the major fraction of circulating immune cells and are rapidly recruited to sites of infection and inflammation. The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that regulates the generation of IL-1 family proteins. The precise subcellular localization and functionality of the inflammasome in human neutrophils are poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that highly purified human neutrophils express key components of the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes, particularly apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), AIM2, and caspase-1. Subcellular fractionation and microscopic analyses further showed that inflammasome components were localized in the cytoplasm and also noncanonically in secretory vesicle and tertiary granule compartments. Whereas IL-1β and IL-18 were expressed at the mRNA level and released as protein, highly purified neutrophils neither expressed nor released IL-1α at baseline or upon stimulation. Upon inflammasome activation, highly purified neutrophils released substantially lower levels of IL-1β protein compared with partially purified neutrophils. Serine proteases and caspases were differentially involved in IL-1β release, depending on the stimulus. Spontaneous activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils in vivo affected IL-1β, but not IL-18 release. In summary, these studies show that human neutrophils express key components of the inflammasome machinery in distinct intracellular compartments and release IL-1β and IL-18, but not IL-1α or IL-33 protein. Targeting the neutrophil inflammasome may represent a future therapeutic strategy to modulate neutrophilic inflammatory diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2131150081,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common primary glomerulonephritis, is characterized by renal immunodeposits containing IgA1 with galactose-deficient O-glycans (Gd-IgA1). These immunodeposits originate from circulating immune complexes consisting of anti-glycan antibodies bound to Gd-IgA1. As clinical disease onset and activity of IgAN often coincide with mucosal infections and dysregulation of cytokines, we hypothesized that cytokines may affect IgA1 O-glycosylation. We used IgA1-secreting cells derived from the circulation of IgAN patients and healthy controls and assessed whether IgA1 O-glycosylation is altered by cytokines. Of the eight cytokines tested, only IL-6 and, to a lesser degree, IL-4 significantly increased galactose deficiency of IgA1; changes in IgA1 O-glycosylation were robust for the cells from IgAN patients. These cytokines reduced galactosylation of the O-glycan substrate directly via decreased expression of the galactosyltransferase C1GalT1 and, indirectly, via increased expression of the sialyltransferase ST6GalNAc-II, which prevents galactosylation by C1GalT1. These findings were confirmed by siRNA knockdown of the corresponding genes and by in vitro enzyme reactions. In summary, IL-6 and IL-4 accentuated galactose deficiency of IgA1 via coordinated modulation of key glycosyltransferases. These data provide a mechanism explaining increased immune-complex formation and disease exacerbation during mucosal infections in IgAN patients."
https://openalex.org/W2049096796,"MicroRNAs are recognized as important post-transcriptional regulators in plants. Information about the roles of miRNAs in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), an agronomically important legume, is yet scant. The objective of this work was to functionally characterize the conserved miRNA: miR398b and its target Cu/Zn Superoxide Dismutase 1 (CSD1) in common bean. We experimentally validated a novel miR398 target: the stress up-regulated Nodulin 19 (Nod19). Expression analysis of miR398b and target genes –CSD1 and Nod19- in bean roots, nodules and leaves, indicated their role in copper (Cu) homeostasis. In bean plants under Cu toxicity miR398b was decreased and Nod19 and CSD1, that participates in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, were up-regulated. The opposite regulation was observed in Cu deficient bean plants; lower levels of CSD1 would allow Cu delivery to essential Cu-containing proteins. Composite common bean plants with transgenic roots over-expressing miR398 showed ca. 20-fold higher mature miR398b and almost negligible target transcript levels as well as increased anthocyanin content and expression of Cu-stress responsive genes, when subjected to Cu deficiency. The down-regulation of miR398b with the consequent up-regulation of its targets was observed in common bean roots during the oxidative burst resulting from short-time exposure to high Cu. A similar response occurred at early stage of bean roots inoculated with Rhizobium tropici, where an increase in ROS was observed. In addition, the miR398b down-regulation and an increase in CSD1 and Nod19 were observed in bean leaves challenged with Sclerotinia scleortiorum fungal pathogen. Transient over-expression of miR398b in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves infected with S. sclerotiorum resulted in enhanced fungal lesions. We conclude that the miR398b-mediated up-regulation of CSD and Nod19 is relevant for common bean plants to cope with oxidative stress generated in abiotic and biotic stresses."
https://openalex.org/W1966455406,"The development of molecular signatures for the prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a methodologically challenging task in bioinformatics and biostatistics. Although there are numerous approaches for the derivation of marker combinations and their evaluation, the underlying methodology often suffers from the problem that different optimization criteria are mixed during the feature selection, estimation and evaluation steps. This might result in marker combinations that are suboptimal regarding the evaluation criterion of interest. To address this issue, we propose a unified framework to derive and evaluate biomarker combinations. Our approach is based on the concordance index for time-to-event data, which is a non-parametric measure to quantify the discriminatory power of a prediction rule. Specifically, we propose a gradient boosting algorithm that results in linear biomarker combinations that are optimal with respect to a smoothed version of the concordance index. We investigate the performance of our algorithm in a large-scale simulation study and in two molecular data sets for the prediction of survival in breast cancer patients. Our numerical results show that the new approach is not only methodologically sound but can also lead to a higher discriminatory power than traditional approaches for the derivation of gene signatures."

https://openalex.org/W2094351393,"Visual perception is not only based on incoming visual signals but also on information about a multimodal reference frame that incorporates vestibulo-proprioceptive input and motor signals. In addition, top-down modulation of visual processing has previously been demonstrated during cognitive operations including selective attention and working memory tasks. In the absence of a stable gravitational reference, the updating of salient stimuli becomes crucial for successful visuo-spatial behavior by humans in weightlessness. Here we found that visually-evoked potentials triggered by the image of a tunnel just prior to an impending 3D movement in a virtual navigation task were altered in weightlessness aboard the International Space Station, while those evoked by a classical 2D-checkerboard were not. Specifically, the analysis of event-related spectral perturbations and inter-trial phase coherency of these EEG signals recorded in the frontal and occipital areas showed that phase-locking of theta-alpha oscillations was suppressed in weightlessness, but only for the 3D tunnel image. Moreover, analysis of the phase of the coherency demonstrated the existence on Earth of a directional flux in the EEG signals from the frontal to the occipital areas mediating a top-down modulation during the presentation of the image of the 3D tunnel. In weightlessness, this fronto-occipital, top-down control was transformed into a diverging flux from the central areas toward the frontal and occipital areas. These results demonstrate that gravity-related sensory inputs modulate primary visual areas depending on the affordances of the visual scene."
https://openalex.org/W2064656117,"Background Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium that has been implicated as the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Metronidazole is currently the first-line treatment for mild to moderate C. difficile infections. Our laboratory isolated a strain of C. difficile with a stable resistance phenotype to metronidazole. A shotgun proteomics approach was used to compare differences in the proteomes of metronidazole-resistant and -susceptible isolates. Methodology/Principal Findings NAP1 C. difficile strains CD26A54_R (Met-resistant), CD26A54_S (reduced- susceptibility), and VLOO13 (Met-susceptible) were grown to mid-log phase, and spiked with metronidazole at concentrations 2 doubling dilutions below the MIC. Peptides from each sample were labeled with iTRAQ and subjected to 2D-LC-MS/MS analysis. In the absence of metronidazole, higher expression was observed of some proteins in C. difficile strains CD26A54_S and CD26A54_R that may be involved with reduced susceptibility or resistance to metronidazole, including DNA repair proteins, putative nitroreductases, and the ferric uptake regulator (Fur). After treatment with metronidazole, moderate increases were seen in the expression of stress-related proteins in all strains. A moderate increase was also observed in the expression of the DNA repair protein RecA in CD26A54_R. Conclusions/Significance This study provided an in-depth proteomic analysis of a stable, metronidazole-resistant C. difficile isolate. The results suggested that a multi-factorial response may be associated with high level metronidazole-resistance in C. difficile, including the possible roles of altered iron metabolism and/or DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1986705931,"Ocean temperatures are increasing globally and the Caribbean is no exception. An extreme ocean warming event in 2010 placed Tobago's coral reefs under severe stress resulting in widespread coral bleaching and threatening the livelihoods that rely on them. The bleaching response of four reef building taxa was monitored over a six month period across three major reefs systems in Tobago. By identifying taxa resilient to bleaching we propose to assist local coral reef managers in the decision making process to cope with mass bleaching events. The bleaching signal (length of exposure to high ocean temperatures) varied widely between the Atlantic and Caribbean reefs, but regardless of this variation most taxa bleached. Colpophyllia natans, Montastraea faveolata and Siderastrea siderea were considered the most bleaching vulnerable taxa. Interestingly, reefs with the highest coral cover showed the greatest decline reef building taxa, and conversely, reefs with the lowest coral cover showed the most bleaching but lowest change in coral cover with little algal overgrowth post-bleaching."
https://openalex.org/W2074171300,"Previous studies conducted cell expansion ex vivo using low initial plating densities for optimal expansion and subsequent differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, MSC populations are heterogeneous and culture conditions can affect the characteristics of MSCs. In this study, differences in gene expression profiles of adipose tissue (AT)-derived MSCs were examined after harvesting cells cultured at different densities. AT-MSCs from three different donors were plated at a density of 200 or 5,000 cells/cm(2). After 7 days in culture, detailed gene expression profiles were investigated using a DNA chip microarray, and subsequently validated using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Gene expression profiles were influenced primarily by the level of cell confluence at harvest. In MSCs harvested at ∼90% confluence, 177 genes were up-regulated and 102 genes down-regulated relative to cells harvested at ∼50% confluence (P<0.05, FC>2). Proliferation-related genes were highly expressed in MSCs harvested at low density, while genes that were highly expressed in MSCs harvested at high density (∼90% confluent) were linked to immunity and defense, cell communication, signal transduction and cell motility. Several cytokine, chemokine and growth factor genes involved in immunosuppression, migration, and reconstitution of damaged tissues were up-regulated in MSCs harvested at high density compared with MSCs harvested at low density. These results imply that cell density at harvest is a critical factor for modulating the specific gene-expression patterns of heterogeneous MSCs."
https://openalex.org/W1971806607,"Injection of a culture supernatant of Serratia marcescens into the bloodstream of the silkworm Bombyx mori increased the number of freely circulating immunosurveillance cells (hemocytes). Using a bioassay with live silkworms, serralysin metalloprotease was purified from the culture supernatant and identified as the factor responsible for this activity. Serralysin inhibited the in vitro attachment of both silkworm hemocytes and murine peritoneal macrophages. Incubation of silkworm hemocytes or murine macrophages with serralysin resulted in degradation of the cellular immune factor BmSPH-1 or calreticulin, respectively. Furthermore, serralysin suppressed in vitro phagocytosis of bacteria by hemocytes and in vivo bacterial clearance in silkworms. Disruption of the ser gene in S. marcescens attenuated its host killing ability in silkworms and mice. These findings suggest that serralysin metalloprotease secreted by S. marcescens suppresses cellular immunity by decreasing the adhesive properties of immunosurveillance cells, thereby contributing to bacterial pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2040200538,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by increased endothelial hyperpermeability. Protein nitration is involved in the endothelial barrier dysfunction in LPS-exposed mice. However, the nitrated proteins involved in this process have not been identified. The activation of the small GTPase RhoA is a critical event in the barrier disruption associated with LPS. Thus, in this study we evaluated the possible role of RhoA nitration in this process. Mass spectroscopy identified a single nitration site, located at Tyr34 in RhoA. Tyr34 is located within the switch I region adjacent to the nucleotide-binding site. Utilizing this structure, we developed a peptide designated NipR1 (nitration inhibitory peptide for RhoA 1) to shield Tyr34 against nitration. TAT-fused NipR1 attenuated RhoA nitration and barrier disruption in LPS-challenged human lung microvascular endothelial cells. Further, treatment of mice with NipR1 attenuated vessel leakage and inflammatory cell infiltration and preserved lung function in a mouse model of ALI. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the mechanism by which Tyr34 nitration stimulates RhoA activity was through a decrease in GDP binding to the protein caused by a conformational change within a region of Switch I, mimicking the conformational shift observed when RhoA is bound to a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Stopped flow kinetic analysis was used to confirm this prediction. Thus, we have identified a new mechanism of nitration-mediated RhoA activation involved in LPS-mediated endothelial barrier dysfunction and show the potential utility of “shielding” peptides to prevent RhoA nitration in the management of ALI.

https://openalex.org/W1968365032,The therapeutic potential of Wnt proteins has long been recognized but challenges associated with in vivo stability and delivery have hindered their development as drug candidates. By exploiting the hydrophobic nature of the protein we provide evidence that exogenous Wnt3a can be delivered in vivo if it is associated with a lipid vesicle. Recombinant Wnt3a associates with the external surface of the lipid membrane; this association stabilizes the protein and leads to prolonged activation of the Wnt pathway in primary cells. We demonstrate the consequences of Wnt pathway activation in vivo using a bone marrow engraftment assay. These data provide validation for the development of WNT3A as a therapeutic protein.
https://openalex.org/W1999842027,"Large-scale phylogenies provide a valuable source to study background diversification rates and investigate if the rates have changed over time. Unfortunately most large-scale, dated phylogenies are sparsely sampled (fewer than 5% of the described species) and taxon sampling is not uniform. Instead, taxa are frequently sampled to obtain at least one representative per subgroup (e.g. family) and thus to maximize diversity (diversified sampling). So far, such complications have been ignored, potentially biasing the conclusions that have been reached. In this study I derive the likelihood of a birth-death process with non-constant (time-dependent) diversification rates and diversified taxon sampling. Using simulations I test if the true parameters and the sampling method can be recovered when the trees are small or medium sized (fewer than 200 taxa). The results show that the diversification rates can be inferred and the estimates are unbiased for large trees but are biased for small trees (fewer than 50 taxa). Furthermore, model selection by means of Akaike's Information Criterion favors the true model if the true rates differ sufficiently from alternative models (e.g. the birth-death model is recovered if the extinction rate is large and compared to a pure-birth model). Finally, I applied six different diversification rate models--ranging from a constant-rate pure birth process to a decreasing speciation rate birth-death process but excluding any rate shift models--on three large-scale empirical phylogenies (ants, mammals and snakes with respectively 149, 164 and 41 sampled species). All three phylogenies were constructed by diversified taxon sampling, as stated by the authors. However only the snake phylogeny supported diversified taxon sampling. Moreover, a parametric bootstrap test revealed that none of the tested models provided a good fit to the observed data. The model assumptions, such as homogeneous rates across species or no rate shifts, appear to be violated."
https://openalex.org/W1980003975,"Sand pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) russet pericarp is an important trait affecting both the quality and stress tolerance of fruits. This trait is controlled by a relative complex genetic process, with some fundamental biological questions such as how many and which genes are involved in the process remaining elusive. In this study, we explored differentially expressed genes between the russet- and green-pericarp offspring from the sand pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) cv. 'Qingxiang' × 'Cuiguan' F1 group by RNA-seq-based bulked segregant analysis (BSA). A total of 29,100 unigenes were identified and 206 of which showed significant differences in expression level (log2fold values>1) between the two types of pericarp pools. Gene Ontology (GO) analyses detected 123 unigenes in GO terms related to 'cellular_component' and 'biological_process', suggesting developmental and growth differentiations between the two types. GO categories associated with various aspects of 'lipid metabolic processes', 'transport', 'response to stress', 'oxidation-reduction process' and more were enriched with genes with divergent expressions between the two libraries. Detailed examination of a selected set of these categories revealed repressed expressions of candidate genes for suberin, cutin and wax biosynthesis in the russet pericarps.Genes encoding putative cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and peroxidase (POD) that are involved in the lignin biosynthesis were suggested to be candidates for pigmentation of sand pear russet pericarps. Nine differentially expressed genes were analyzed for their expressions using qRT-PCR and the results were consistent with those obtained from Illumina RNA-sequencing. This study provides a comprehensive molecular biology insight into the sand pear pericarp pigmentation and appearance quality formation."

https://openalex.org/W2038986004,"The objective of this study was to employ genetically engineered IGF-II analogs to establish which receptor(s) mediate the stemness promoting actions of IGF-II on mouse subventricular zone neural precursors. Neural precursors from the subventricular zone were propagated in vitro in culture medium supplemented with IGF-II analogs. Cell growth and identity were analyzed using sphere generation and further analyzed by flow cytometry. F19A, an analog of IGF-II that does not bind the IGF-2R, stimulated an increase in the proportion of neural stem cells (NSCs) while decreasing the proportion of the later stage progenitors at a lower concentration than IGF-II. V43M, which binds to the IGF-2R with high affinity but which has low binding affinity to the IGF-1R and to the A isoform of the insulin receptor (IR-A) failed to promote NSC growth. The positive effects of F19A on NSC growth were unaltered by the addition of a functional blocking antibody to the IGF-1R. Altogether, these data lead to the conclusion that IGF-II promotes stemness of NSCs via the IR-A and not through activation of either the IGF-1R or the IGF-2R."
https://openalex.org/W1994773832,"Caspase 8 plays an essential role in the regulation of apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling pathways. The long form of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIPL) has been shown previously to regulate caspase 8-dependent nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation by receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). In this study, the molecular mechanism by which c-FLIPL regulates caspase 8-dependent NF-κB activation was further explored in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293 and variant cells barely expressing caspase 8. The caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone greatly diminished caspase 8-dependent NF-κB activation induced by Fas ligand (FasL) when c-FLIPL, but not its N-terminal fragment c-FLIP(p43), was expressed. The prodomain of caspase 8 was found to interact with the RIP1 death domain and to be sufficient to mediate NF-κB activation induced by FasL or c-FLIP(p43). The interaction of the RIP1 death domain with caspase 8 was inhibited by c-FLIPL but not c-FLIP(p43). Thus, these results reveal that the C-terminal domain of c-FLIPL specifically inhibits the interaction of the caspase 8 prodomain with the RIP1 death domain and, thereby, regulates caspase 8-dependent NF-κB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2008084195,"Both the acoustic variability of a distractor sequence and the degree to which it violates expectations are important determinants of auditory distraction. In four experiments we examined the relative contribution of local auditory changes on the one hand and expectation violations on the other hand in the disruption of serial recall by irrelevant sound. We present evidence for a greater disruption by auditory sequences ending in unexpected steady state distractor repetitions compared to auditory sequences with expected changing state endings even though the former contained fewer local changes. This effect was demonstrated with piano melodies (Experiment 1) and speech distractors (Experiment 2). Furthermore, it was replicated when the expectation violation occurred after the encoding of the target items (Experiment 3), indicating that the items' maintenance in short-term memory was disrupted by attentional capture and not their encoding. This seems to be primarily due to the violation of a model of the specific auditory distractor sequences because the effect vanishes and even reverses when the experiment provides no opportunity to build up a specific neural model about the distractor sequence (Experiment 4). Nevertheless, the violation of abstract long-term knowledge about auditory regularities seems to cause a small and transient capture effect: Disruption decreased markedly over the course of the experiments indicating that participants habituated to the unexpected distractor repetitions across trials. The overall pattern of results adds to the growing literature that the degree to which auditory distractors violate situation-specific expectations is a more important determinant of auditory distraction than the degree to which a distractor sequence contains local auditory changes."
https://openalex.org/W2078725021,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that forms chronic biofilm infections in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. A major component of the biofilm during these infections is the exopolysaccharide alginate, which is synthesized at the inner membrane as a homopolymer of 1-4-linked β-D-mannuronate. As the polymer passages through the periplasm, 22-44% of the mannuronate residues are converted to α-L-guluronate by the C5-epimerase AlgG to produce a polymer of alternating β-D-mannuronate and α-L-guluronate blocks and stretches of polymannuronate. To understand the molecular basis of alginate epimerization, the structure of Pseudomonas syringae AlgG has been determined at 2.1-Å resolution, and the protein was functionally characterized. The structure reveals that AlgG is a long right-handed parallel β-helix with an elaborate lid structure. Functional analysis of AlgG mutants suggests that His(319) acts as the catalytic base and that Arg(345) neutralizes the acidic group during the epimerase reaction. Water is the likely catalytic acid. Electrostatic surface potential and residue conservation analyses in conjunction with activity and substrate docking studies suggest that a conserved electropositive groove facilitates polymannuronate binding and contains at least nine substrate binding subsites. These subsites likely align the polymer in the correct register for catalysis to occur. The presence of multiple subsites, the electropositive groove, and the non-random distribution of guluronate in the alginate polymer suggest that AlgG is a processive enzyme. Moreover, comparison of AlgG and the extracellular alginate epimerase AlgE4 of Azotobacter vinelandii provides a structural rationale for the differences in their Ca(2+) dependence."
https://openalex.org/W1995402091,"Epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressor genes has been observed in various cancers. Looking at hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specific protein silencing was previously demonstrated to be associated with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, the proposed HCV dependent promoter methylation of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes and thereby enhanced progression of hepatocarcinogenesis has been the subject of controversial discussion. We investigated promoter methylation pattern of the MMR genes MLH1, MSH2 and PMS2 as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A gene (p16) in 61 well characterized patients with HCCs associated with HCV, Hepatitis B virus infection or alcoholic liver disease. DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour and non-tumour adjacent tissue and analysed by methylation-specific PCR. Moreover, microsatellite analysis was performed in tissues showing methylation in MMR gene promoters. Our data demonstrated that promoter methylation of MLH1, MSH2, PMS2 and p16 is present among all considered HCCs. Hereby, promoter silencing was detectable more frequently in advanced-stage HCCs than in low-stage ones. However, there was no significant correlation between aberrant DNA methylation of MMR genes or p16 and HCV infection in related HCC specimens. In summary, we show that promoter methylation of essential MMR genes and p16 is detectable in HCCs most dominantly in pT3 stage tumour cases. Since loss of MMR proteins was previously described to be not only responsible for tumour development but also for chemotherapy resistance, the knowledge of mechanisms jointly responsible for HCC progression might enable significant improvement of individual HCC therapy in the future."

https://openalex.org/W2021459312,"Eukaryotic membrane proteins generally reside in membrane bilayers that have lipid asymmetry. However, in vitro studies of the impact of lipids upon membrane proteins are generally carried out in model membrane vesicles that lack lipid asymmetry. Our recently developed method to prepare lipid vesicles with asymmetry similar to that in plasma membranes and with controlled amounts of cholesterol was used to investigate the influence of lipid composition and lipid asymmetry upon the conformational behavior of the pore-forming, cholesterol-dependent cytolysin perfringolysin O (PFO). PFO conformational behavior in asymmetric vesicles was found to be distinct both from that in symmetric vesicles with the same lipid composition as the asymmetric vesicles and from that in vesicles containing either only the inner leaflet lipids from the asymmetric vesicles or only the outer leaflet lipids from the asymmetric vesicles. The presence of phosphatidylcholine in the outer leaflet increased the cholesterol concentration required to induce PFO binding, whereas phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of asymmetric vesicles stabilized the formation of a novel deeply inserted conformation that does not form pores, even though it contains transmembrane segments. This conformation may represent an important intermediate stage in PFO pore formation. These studies show that lipid asymmetry can strongly influence the behavior of membrane-inserted proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2073848152,"Porphyromonas gingivalis, a Gram-negative asaccharolytic anaerobe, is a major causative organism of chronic periodontitis. Because the bacterium utilizes amino acids as energy and carbon sources and incorporates them mainly as dipeptides, a wide variety of dipeptide production processes mediated by dipeptidyl-peptidases (DPPs) should be beneficial for the organism. In the present study, we identified the fourth P. gingivalis enzyme, DPP5. In a dpp4-7-11-disrupted P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, a DPP7-like activity still remained. PGN_0756 possessed an activity indistinguishable from that of the mutant, and was identified as a bacterial orthologue of fungal DPP5, because of its substrate specificity and 28.5% amino acid sequence identity with an Aspergillus fumigatus entity. P. gingivalis DPP5 was composed of 684 amino acids with a molecular mass of 77,453, and existed as a dimer while migrating at 66 kDa on SDS-PAGE. It preferred Ala and hydrophobic residues, had no activity toward Pro at the P1 position, and no preference for hydrophobic P2 residues, showed an optimal pH of 6.7 in the presence of NaCl, demonstrated Km and kcat/Km values for Lys-Ala-MCA of 688 μM and 11.02 μM(-1) s(-1), respectively, and was localized in the periplasm. DPP5 elaborately complemented DPP7 in liberation of dipeptides with hydrophobic P1 residues. Examinations of DPP- and gingipain gene-disrupted mutants indicated that DPP4, DPP5, DPP7, and DPP11 together with Arg- and Lys-gingipains cooperatively liberate most dipeptides from nutrient oligopeptides. This is the first study to report that DPP5 is expressed not only in eukaryotes, but also widely distributed in bacteria and archaea."

We have employed mass spectrometry-based tyrosine, serine, and threonine phosphoproteomics for the unbiased analysis of platelet signaling pathways induced by oxPCCD36 as well as by the strong physiological agonist thrombin. oxPCCD36 and thrombin induced differential phosphorylation of 115 proteins (162 phosphorylation sites) and 181 proteins (334 phosphorylation sites) respectively. Most of the phosphoproteome changes induced by either agonist have never been reported in platelets; thus they provide candidates in the study of platelet signaling. Bioinformatic analyses of protein phosphorylation dependent responses were used to categorize preferential motifs for (de)phosphorylation, predict pathways and kinase activity, and construct a phosphoproteome network regulating integrin activation. A putative signaling pathway involving Src-family kinases, SYK, and PLCγ2 was identified in platelets activated by oxPCCD36. Subsequent ex vivo studies in human platelets demonstrated that this pathway is downstream of the scavenger receptor CD36 and is critical for platelet activation by oxPCCD36. Our results provide multiple insights into the mechanism of platelet activation and specifically in platelet regulation by oxPCCD36."
https://openalex.org/W2080956192,"Chromatin insulators, such as the chicken β-globin locus control region hypersensitive site 4 (HS4), and scaffold/matrix attachment regions (SARs/MARs) have been incorporated separately or in combination into retroviral vectors (RVs) in order to increase transgene expression levels, avoid silencing and reduce expression variability. However, their incorporation into RVs either produces a reduction on titer and/or expression levels or do not have sufficient effect on stem cells. In order to develop an improved insulator we decided to combine SAR elements with HS4 insulators. We designed several synthetic shorter SAR elements containing 4 or 5 MAR/SARs recognition signatures (MRS) and studied their effects on a lentiviral vector (LV) expressing eGFP through the SFFV promoter (SE). A 388 bp SAR element containing 5 MRS, named SAR2, was as efficient or superior to the other SARs analyzed. SAR2 enhanced transgene expression and reduced silencing and variability on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We next compared the effect of different HS4-based insulators, the HS4-Core (250 bp), the HS4-Ext (400 bp) and the HS4-650 (650 bp). All HS4 elements reduced silencing and expression variability but they also had a negative effect on transgene expression levels and titer. In general, the HS4-650 element had a better overall effect. Based on these data we developed a chimeric insulator, IS2, combining the SAR2 and the HS4-650. When incorporated into the 3′ LTR of the SE LV, the IS2 element was able to enhance expression, avoid silencing and reduce variability of expression on hESCs. Importantly, these effects were maintained after differentiation of the transduced hESCs toward the hematopoietic linage. Neither the HS4-650 nor the SAR2 elements had these effects. The IS2 element is therefore a novel insulator that confers expression stability and enhances expression of LVs on stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2034289530,"Classic embryological studies have documented the inductive role of root dentin on adjacent periodontal ligament differentiation. The biochemical composition of root dentin includes collagens and cleavage products of dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), such as dentin sialoprotein (DSP). The high abundance of DSP in root dentin prompted us to ask the question whether DSP or peptides derived thereof would serve as potent biological matrix components to induce periodontal progenitors to further differentiate into periodontal ligament cells. Here, we test the hypothesis that domain of DSP influences cell fate. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses showed that the COOH-terminal DSP domain is expressed in mouse periodontium at various stages of root development. The recombinant COOH-terminal DSP fragment (rC-DSP) enhanced attachment and migration of human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSC), human primary PDL cells without cell toxicity. rC-DSP induced PDLSC cell proliferation as well as differentiation and mineralization of PDLSC and PDL cells by formation of mineralized tissue and ALPase activity. Effect of rC-DSP on cell proliferation and differentiation was to promote gene expression of tooth/bone-relate markers, transcription factors and growth factors. The results for the first time showed that rC-DSP may be one of the components of cell niche for stimulating stem/progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation and a natural scaffold for periodontal regeneration application."

These degradative processes are better documented for inflammatory joint diseases than tendinopathy even though the pathogenesis has many similarities. The aims of this study were to investigate the proteomic composition of injured tendons during early and late disease stages to identify disease-specific cleavage patterns of the ECM protein cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). In addition to characterizing fragments released in naturally occurring disease, we hypothesized that stimulation of tendon explants with proinflammatory mediators in vitro would induce fragments of COMP analogous to natural disease. Therefore, normal tendon explants were stimulated with IL-1β and prostaglandin E2, and their effects on the release of COMP and its cleavage patterns were characterized. Analyses of injured tendons identified an altered proteomic composition of the ECM at all stages post injury, showing protein fragments that were specific to disease stage. IL-1β enhanced the proteolytic cleavage and release of COMP from tendon explants, whereas PGE2 had no catabolic effect. Of the cleavage fragments identified in early stage tendon disease, two fragments were generated by an IL-1-mediated mechanism. These fragments provide a platform for the development of neo-epitope assays specific to injury stage for tendon disease.

https://openalex.org/W1991309173,"Temperature affects all biological functions and will therefore modulate ecologically significant interactions between animals and their environment. Here, we examined the effect of ambient temperature (Ta) on the thermal biology and energy budget in striped hamsters acclimated to cold (5°C), warm (21°C) and hot temperatures (31°C). Thermoneutral zone (TNZ) was 22.5-32.5°C, 25-32.5°C and 30-32.5°C in the cold-, warm- and hot-acclimated hamsters, respectively. The cold acclimation decreased the lower critical temperature and made the TNZ wider, and hot exposure elevated the lower critical temperature, resulting in a narrow TNZ. Within the TNZ, cold-acclimated hamsters showed a significantly higher rate of metabolism and thermogenesis than those acclimated to hot temperature. Digestive enzymes activities, including intestinal sucrase, maltase, L-alanine aminopeptidase-N and leucine aminopeptidase were higher in the cold than in the hot. The changes in metabolic rate and thermogenesis at different temperatures were in parallel with cytochrome c oxidase activity and uncoupling protein 1 gene expression of brown adipose tissue. This suggests that the shift of the lower critical temperature of TNZ is possibly associated with the rate of metabolism and thermogenesis, as well as with the digestive capacity of the gastrointestinal tract at different Ta. The upper critical temperature of TNZ may be independent of the changes in Ta. The changes of lower critical temperature of TNZ are an important strategy in adaption to variations of Ta."
https://openalex.org/W2008749945,"Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is a zinc finger transcription factor that is highly expressed in the crypt epithelial cells of the intestine and plays a critical role in regulating proliferation of both normal intestinal epithelial cells and colorectal cancer cells. Stability of the KLF5 is mediated by proteasomal degradation via phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and recognition by F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBW7) of a phosphodegron sequence surrounding serine 303 in KLF5. A genomic analysis of colorectal cancer tissues identified a somatic mutation (P301S) in KLF5 within the phosphodegron sequence. We hypothesized that due to its close proximity to the phosphodegron sequence, the P301S mutation may affect signaling that is involved in proper KLF5 degradation. We demonstrated that the P301S KLF5 mutant has a longer half-life than wild type (WT) KLF5. Furthermore, P301S KLF5 has a higher transcriptional activity than WT KLF5 as demonstrated by luciferase assays using cyclin D1 and CDC2 promoter constructs. In contrast to WT KLF5, P301S KLF5 does not physically interact with FBW7α. Concomitantly, the P301S KLF5 mutant displays reduced levels of phosphorylation at serine 303 in comparison with WT KLF5. These results of our study indicate that amino acid residue 301 of KLF5 is critical for proper recognition of the phosphodegron sequence by FBW7α and that the P301S mutation inhibits this recognition, leading to a degradation-resistant protein with elevated levels and enhanced transcriptional activity.

Of interest is that a somatic mutation in KLF5, P301S, has been identified in a colorectal cancer sample (21.Sjöblom T. Jones S. Wood L.D. Parsons D.W. Lin J. Barber T.D. Mandelker D. Leary R.J.

Here, we demonstrate that the P301S mutation interferes with GSK3β phosphorylation of serine 303 in KLF5 that is required for FBW7α-mediated degradation of KLF5. We show that the P301S KLF5 mutant has decreased levels of phosphorylation at serine 303 and reduced interaction with FBW7α. We also find that P301S KLF5 mutant is characterized by a prolonged half-life and increased transcriptional activity. Collectively, our results provide evidence that proline residue in amino acid position 301 in KLF5 is necessary for the recognition of human KLF5 phosphodegron sequence by GSK3β and FBW7α. The human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line and DLD-1 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HEK cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. DLD-1 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and HCT116 cells were maintained in McCoy's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cell culture media, FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, Lipofectamine 2000, and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX were purchased from Life Technologies. Cycloheximide and MG132 were purchased from Calbiochem. A rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against amino acid positions 95–111 of the KLF5 protein was manufactured by SDIX/OriGene. Rabbit antibodies against FBW7α were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories, and GSK3β was from Cell Signaling. Rabbit antibodies against phospho-Ser-303 KLF5 were purchased from Panora Biotech. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against HA and β-actin were purchased from Covance and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. WT Human KLF5 cDNA with an N-terminal HA tag was inserted into pEGFP-N1 after excision of gene encoding EGFP (WT KLF5). S303A and P301S KLF5 constructs were provided by the Custom Cloning Core Facility of Emory University, Atlanta, GA. P301A and P301E KLF5 constructs were provided by the Molecular Cloning Core Facility of Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY. All KLF5 constructs have an N-terminal HA tag. Plasmid encoding FBW7α was a gift from Dr. Michelle Pagano (Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), New York University), and GSK3β was a gift from Dr. Peter Klein (University of Pennsylvania). Cells were transfected with WT, S303A, and P301S human KLF5 constructs alone or in combination with plasmid encoding FBW7α. At 24 h after transfection, cycloheximide was added to the cells to a final concentration of 10 μm. Protein samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, and 3 h after the addition of cycloheximide and subjected to Western blot analysis. HEK, DLD-1, and HCT116 cells at 80–90% confluence were transfected with WT, S303A, or P301S human KLF5 constructs or in combination with GSK3β and FBW7α plasmids, using Lipofectamine 2000. Protein extracts were collected 24 h after transfection and subjected to Western blot analysis. HEK cells at 80–90% confluence were transfected with WT, S303A, or P301S human KLF5 constructs, or in combination, using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were additionally transfected with firefly luciferase reporter constructs bearing cyclin D1 or CDC2 promoters, and a Renilla luciferase reporter (Promega) for transfection efficiencies. The firefly luciferase activity was normalized to protein concentrations. Luciferase activities were determined at 24 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase assay system kit (Promega). For small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments, validated Stealth Select siRNAs for human FBW7α were obtained from Life Technologies. HEK and HCT116 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX with either nonspecific siRNA or siRNAs specific for FBW7α with a combination of WT, S303A, or P301S KLF5 constructs. Protein extracts were collected 24 h after transfection and subjected to Western blot analysis. To detect interaction between KLF5 and FBW7α, HEK cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 or DMSO (vehicle) for 6 h followed by co-immunoprecipitation. Briefly, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/phosphatase inhibitor solution and collected in homemade immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor cocktail (purchased from Calbiochem). The solutions were spun for 5 min at 1,100 rpm at 4 °C; cells were suspended in immunoprecipitation buffer and sonicated twice for 10 s. The lysates were spun for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and supernatants containing protein extracts were collected. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein G magnetic beads (Cell Signaling) for 10 min at room temperature. The immune complexes were washed six times with immunoprecipitation buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. HEK cells at 80–90% confluence were transfected with WT, S303A, or P301S human KLF5 constructs in combination with FBW7α and ubiquitin-expressing plasmids. At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 for 3 h, and cell lysates were collected and subjected to Western blot analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A genomic analysis of colorectal cancer tissues identified a somatic mutation, P301S, in KLF5 (21.Sjöblom T. Jones S. Wood L.D. Parsons D.W. Lin J. Barber T.D. Mandelker D. Leary R.J. Ptak J.

Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Velculescu V.E. The consensus coding sequences of human breast and colorectal cancers.Science. 2006; 314: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2842) Google Scholar). Because the identified mutation is localized close to or within the phosphodegron sequence in KLF5, we examined the impact of the P301S mutation on KLF5 protein stability. Previously, it has been shown that S303A mutation within human KLF5 protein renders it insensitive to GSK3β-dependent degradation facilitated by FBW7α (19.Zhao D. Zheng H.Q. Zhou Z. Chen C. The Fbw7 tumor suppressor targets KLF5 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation and suppresses breast cell proliferation.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 4728-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We therefore employed a S303A KLF5 construct throughout our studies as a positive control. First, to determine the stability of the P301S KLF5 mutant, we performed cycloheximide chase experiments in HEK cells transfected with WT, P301S, or S303A KLF5 constructs. Following the addition of cycloheximide, protein samples were collected hourly for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, WT KLF5 levels decreased over the time course with a half-life of ∼1.6 h (Fig. 1B, Table 1). In contrast, P301S and S303A KLF5 levels were relatively stable over the 3 h of treatment and had significantly longer half-lives than WT KLF5 protein (Fig. 1, A and B, and Table 1). We also performed cycloheximide chase experiments in human colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116 and DLD-1 (Fig. 2). As shown, P301S and S303A KLF5 have significantly increased protein half-lives in comparison with WT KLF5 in HCT116 and DLD-1 cell lines (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Noted also is that the rate of degradation of all KLF5 proteins in DLD-1 and HCT116 cells was slightly higher than in HEK cells.TABLE 1Estimated half-lives of WT, P301S, and S303A KLF5 proteins in HEK, HCT116 and DLD-1 cell lines from cycloheximide chase experiments based on overexpression aloneCell lineProteinWTS303AP301ShHEK1.633.915.8HCT1161.64.92.4DLD-11.83.54.9 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Human P301S KLF5 protein has increased stability as compared with WT KLF5 as tested in HCT116 and DLD-1 colorectal cancer cell lines.

As shown in Fig. 1C, both P301S and S303A KLF5 activated the cyclin D1 and CDC2 to a significantly higher extent than WT KLF5. To test the sensitivity of the P301S KLF5 mutant to FBW7α-mediated degradation, we overexpressed WT, P301S, or S303A KLF5 constructs with increasing levels of FBW7α in HEK cells and measured the rate of KLF5 degradation. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, P301S and S303A KLF5 mutants were significantly more resistant to FBW7α-mediated degradation than WT KLF5. Additionally, we performed cycloheximide chase assays after co-expressing FBW7α with WT, P301S, or S303A KLF5 constructs in HEK, HCT116, and DLD-1 cell lines. FBW7α overexpression in HEK cells reduced the half-life of WT KLF5 protein significantly more than those of P301S and S303A KLF5 proteins (Fig. 3, C and D, and Table 2). Similar results were obtained when the same experiments were performed in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells (Fig. 4 and Table 2). These results indicate that P301S KLF5 is less sensitive to FBW7α-mediated degradation than WT KLF5 in both colorectal cancer-derived and non-colorectal cancer-derived cells.TABLE 2Estimated half-lives of WT, P301S, and S303A KLF5 proteins in HEK, HCT116 and DLD-1 cell lines from cycloheximide chase experiments based on overexpression in combination with FBW7αCell lineProteinWTS303AP301ShHEK0.73.14.7HCT1160.99.64.4DLD-10.93.44.2 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Human P301S KLF5 protein is more resistant to FBW7α-mediated degradation than WT KLF5 in HCT116 and DLD-1 colorectal cancer cell lines.

As shown in Fig. 5, A and B (HEK and HCT116, respectively), WT KLF5 levels increased upon depletion of FBW7α. However, levels of either P301S or S303A KLF5 failed to increase after FBW7α knockdown in HEK cells (Fig. 5A), and the levels of P301S were only slightly increased with no change in S303A levels in HCT116 (Fig. 5B). To further explore whether this was a result of insensitivity of P301S KLF5 to proteasomal degradation mediated by FBW7α, we transfected HEK and HCT116 cells with WT, P301S, or S303A KLF5 and FBW7α constructs and treated the cells with MG132 (an inhibitor of proteasomal degradation) or vehicle. Inhibition of proteasomal degradation increased the levels of WT KLF5 protein in HEK and HCT116 cells (Fig. 5, C and D, respectively). In contrast, P301S and S303A KLF5 levels were not affected by suppression of proteasomal activity in either cell type (Fig. 5, C and D). Furthermore, to examine whether the decrease in FBW7α-mediated degradation of P301S KLF5 was the result of a loss of interaction between FBW7α and the KLF5 mutants, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We transfected HEK cells with WT, P301S, or S303A KLF5 and FBW7α constructs and treated the cells with MG132 or vehicle. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with HA antibodies, and protein complexes were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against KLF5 and FBW7α. As shown in Fig. 5E, whereas WT KLF5 interacted with FBW7α, there was no detected interaction between P301S or S303A and FBW7α. FBW7α facilitates proteasomal degradation of WT KLF5 protein via phosphorylation of serine 303 and recognition of a phosphodegron sequence surrounding serine 303, which are mediated by GSK3β and FBW7α, respectively (19.Zhao D.

We investigated whether overexpression of GSK3β influences the recognition and binding of P301S KLF5 by FBW7α. Expression of FBW7α alone or in combination with GSK3β caused effective degradation of WT KLF5 in HEK and HCT116 cells (Fig. 6, A and B, respectively). However, co-expression of GSK3β and FBW7α did not change the level of either P301S or S303A KLF5 mutant in HEK and had only meager effect on P301S and S303A KLF5 mutants in HCT116 cells (Fig. 6, A and B, respectively). Thereafter, we examined the phosphorylation levels of serine 303 in WT, P301S, and S303A KLF5 constructs. We co-expressed GSK3β construct with WT, P301S, and S303A KLF5 constructs in HEK cells and treated cells with MG132 to stabilize KLF5 protein levels. As shown in Fig. 6C, overexpression of GSK3β with a combination of MG132 treatment increased the levels of both phosphorylated serine 303 and total protein of WT KLF5. In contrast, the P301S and S303A KLF5 mutants had much less serine 303 phosphorylation as compared with WT KLF5. Furthermore, we examined the ubiquitination status of WT, P301S, and S303A KLF5 alongside overexpression with ubiquitin and FBW7α. As shown in Fig. 6D, WT KLF5 has higher level of ubiquitination than P301S and S303A KLF5. Taken together, these data suggest that reduced phosphorylation of serine 303 is responsible for the decreased degradation of P301S KLF5 mutant. To assess the importance of proline residue in the 301 position of KLF5, we tested FBW7α-mediated degradation of P301A (resistant to phosphor"

We assessed the effects of GLP-1 on MGU in healthy subjects during normo- and hypoglycemia.We included eighteen healthy men in two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over studies. MGU was assessed with GLP-1 or saline infusion during pituitary-pancreatic normo- (plasma glucose (PG): 4.5 mM, n = 10) and hypoglycemic clamps (PG: 3.0 mM, n = 8) by positron emission tomography with (18)fluoro-deoxy-glucose ((18)F-FDG) as tracer.In the normoglycemia study mean (± SD) age was 25±3 years, and BMI was 22.6±0.6 kg/m(2) and in the hypoglycemia study the mean age was 23±2 years with a mean body mass index of 23±2 kg/m(2). GLP-1 did not change MGU during normoglycemia (mean (+/- SD) 0.15+/-0.04 and 0.16+/-0.03 µmol/g/min, P = 0.46) or during hypoglycemia (0.16+/-0.03 and 0.13+/-0.04 µmol/g/min, P = 0.14). However, the effect of GLP-1 on MGU was negatively correlated to baseline MGU both during normo- and hypoglycemia, (P = 0.006, r(2) = 0.64 and P = 0.018, r(2) = 0.64, respectively) and changes in MGU correlated positively with the level of insulin resistance (HOMA 2IR) during hypoglycemia, P = 0.04, r(2) = 0.54. GLP-1 mediated an increase in circulating glucagon levels at PG levels below 3.5 mM and increased glucose infusion rates during the hypoglycemia study. No differences in other circulating hormones or metabolites were found.While GLP-1 does not affect overall MGU, GLP-1 induces changes in MGU dependent on baseline MGU such that GLP-1 increases MGU in subjects with low baseline MGU and decreases MGU in subjects with high baseline MGU. GLP-1 preserves MGU during hypoglycemia in insulin resistant subjects. ClinicalTrials.gov registration numbers: NCT00418288: (hypoglycemia) and NCT00256256: (normoglycemia)."

The critical issue in understanding the psychological response after experiencing severe disasters is to distinguish neurological microstructural underpinnings as vulnerability factors from signs of emotional distress acquired soon after the stressful life event. We collected diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) data from a group of healthy adolescents before the Great East Japan Earthquake and re-examined the DTIs and anxiety levels of 30 non-PTSD subjects from this group 3-4 months after the earthquake using voxel-based analyses in a longitudinal DTI study before and after the earthquake. We found that the state anxiety level after the earthquake was negatively associated with fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right anterior cingulum (Cg) before the earthquake (r = -0.61, voxel level p<0.0025, cluster level p<0.05 corrected), and positively associated with increased FA changes from before to after the earthquake in the left anterior Cg (r = 0.70, voxel level p<0.0025, cluster level p<0.05 corrected) and uncinate fasciculus (Uf) (r = 0.65, voxel level p<0.0025, cluster level p<0.05 corrected). The results demonstrated that lower FA in the right anterior Cg was a vulnerability factor and increased FA in the left anterior Cg and Uf was an acquired sign of state anxiety after the earthquake. We postulate that subjects with dysfunctions in processing fear and anxiety before the disaster were likely to have higher anxiety levels requiring frequent emotional regulation after the disaster. These findings provide new evidence of psychophysiological responses at the neural network level soon after a stressful life event and might contribute to the development of effective methods to prevent PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W2059818812,"Infection with high-risk (hr) human papillomavirus (HPV) is considered the necessary cause of cervical cancer. Vaccination against HPV16 and 18 types, which are responsible of about 75% of cervical cancer worldwide, is expected to have a major global impact on cervical cancer occurrence. Valid estimates of the parameters that regulate the natural history of hrHPV infections are crucial to draw reliable projections of the impact of vaccination. We devised a mathematical model to estimate the probability of infection transmission, the rate of clearance, and the patterns of immune response following the clearance of infection of 13 hrHPV types. To test the validity of our estimates, we fitted the same transmission model to two large independent datasets from Italy and Sweden and assessed finding consistency. The two populations, both unvaccinated, differed substantially by sexual behaviour, age distribution, and study setting (screening for cervical cancer or Chlamydia trachomatis infection). Estimated transmission probability of hrHPV types (80% for HPV16, 73%-82% for HPV18, and above 50% for most other types); clearance rates decreasing as a function of time since infection; and partial protection against re-infection with the same hrHPV type (approximately 20% for HPV16 and 50% for the other types) were similar in the two countries. The model could accurately predict the HPV16 prevalence observed in Italy among women who were not infected three years before. In conclusion, our models inform on biological parameters that cannot at the moment be measured directly from any empirical data but are essential to forecast the impact of HPV vaccination programmes."

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence, genotype distribution and risk factors associated with anal HPV infection among men attending an STI clinic in Puerto Rico.We conducted a cross-sectional study among 205 men 18 years and older. A comprehensive survey was administered that included a demographic and a behavioral assessment. Separate logistic regression models were performed to determine factors associated with any, high-risk (HR), and multiple anal HPV infection.The mean age of the study sample was 38.0±13.5 years. The most common HR types were 58, 51 and 31. Overall, HR anal HPV infection was found in 53.5% of the participants. Multiple HPV types in the anal canal were found in 47.6% of the sample. A third (29.8%) of participants reported being men who had sex with men (MSM). MSM had a significantly higher prevalence of any, HR and multiple HPV infection (p-value<0.05). Separate multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that being MSM was associated with any (OR = 4.5; [95%CI: 1.9-10.7]), HR (OR = 3.4; [95%CI: 1.1-10.3) and multiple anal HPV infection (OR = 3.6; [95%CI: 1.5-9.1).

The molecular mechanism of how the homologous β subunits differentially alter BK channel functions and the role of different BK channel functions in various physiologic processes remain unclear. By studying channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we show a novel disulfide-cross-linked dimer conopeptide, Vt3.1 that preferentially inhibits BK channels containing the β4 subunit, which is most abundantly expressed in brain and important for neuronal functions. Vt3.1 inhibits the currents by a maximum of 71%, shifts the G-V relation by 45 mV approximately half-saturation concentrations, and alters both open and closed time of single channel activities, indicating that the toxin alters voltage dependence of the channel. Vt3.1 contains basic residues and inhibits voltage-dependent activation by electrostatic interactions with acidic residues in the extracellular loops of the slo1 and β4 subunits. These results suggest a large interaction surface between the slo1 subunit of BK channels and the β4 subunit, providing structural insight into the molecular interactions between slo1 and β4 subunits. The results also suggest that Vt3.1 is an excellent tool for studying β subunit modulation of BK channels and for understanding the physiological roles of BK channels in neurophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2066070179,"The role of the GPI-anchor in prion disease pathogenesis is still a challenging issue. In vitro studies have shown that anchorless cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) undergoes aberrant post-translational processing and metabolism. Moreover, transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing anchorless PrP(C) develop a spontaneous neurological disease accompanied with widespread brain PrP amyloid deposition, in the absence of spongiform changes. Generation of PrP forms lacking the GPI and PrP amyloidosis are striking features of human stop codon mutations in the PrP gene (PRNP), associated with PrP cerebral amyloid angiopathy (PrP-CAA) and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome. More recently, the presence of anchorless PrP species has been also claimed in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). Using a highly sensitive protein separation technique and taking advantage of reference maps of synthetic PrP peptides, we investigated brain tissues from scrapie-infected ""anchorless PrP"" Tg mice and wild type mice to determine the contribution of the GPI-anchor to the molecular mass and isoelectric point of PrP quasispecies under two-dimensional electrophoresis. We also assessed the conformational properties of anchorless and anchored prions under standard and inactivating conditions. These studies were extended to sCJD and GSS. At variance with GSS, characterization of PrP quasispecies in different sCJD subtypes ruled out the presence of anchorless prions. Moreover, under inactivating conditions, mice anchorless prions, but not sCJD prions, generated internal PrP fragments, cleaved at both N and C termini, similar to those found in PrP-CAA and GSS brain tissues. These findings show that anchorless PrP(Sc) generates GSS-like PrP fragments, and suggest a major role for unanchored PrP in amyloidogenesis."

Consequently, concurrent inhibition of Bcl-xL in combination with chemotherapy may improve treatment outcomes for patients. Here, we develop a mathematical model to investigate the potential of combination therapy with ABT-737, a small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-xL, and carboplatin, a platinum-based drug, on a simulated tumor xenograft. The model is calibrated against in vivo experimental data, wherein xenografts established in mice were treated with ABT-737 and/or carboplatin on a fixed periodic schedule. The validated model is used to predict the minimum drug load that will achieve a predetermined level of tumor growth inhibition, thereby maximizing the synergy between the two drugs. Our simulations suggest that the infusion-duration of each carboplatin dose is a critical parameter, with an 8-hour infusion of carboplatin given weekly combined with a daily bolus dose of ABT-737 predicted to minimize residual disease. The potential of combination therapy to prevent or delay the onset of carboplatin-resistance is also investigated. When resistance is acquired as a result of aberrant DNA-damage repair in cells treated with carboplatin, drug delivery schedules that induce tumor remission with even low doses of combination therapy can be identified. Intrinsic resistance due to pre-existing cohorts of resistant cells precludes tumor regression, but dosing strategies that extend disease-free survival periods can still be identified. These results highlight the potential of our model to accelerate the development of novel therapeutics such as BH3 mimetics."
https://openalex.org/W2019603874,"Caloric restriction (CR) and chemical agents, such as resveratrol and rapamycin that partially mimic the CR effect, can delay morbidity and mortality across a broad range of species. In humans, however, the effects of CR or other life-extending agents have not yet been investigated systematically. Human maximal lifespan is already substantially greater compared to that of closely related primate species. It is therefore possible that humans have acquired genetic mutations that mimic the CR effect. Here, we tested this notion by comparing transcriptome differences between humans and other primates, with the transcriptome changes observed in mice subjected to CR. We show that the human transcriptome state, relative to other primate transcriptomes, does not match that of the CR mice or mice treated with resveratrol, but resembles the transcriptome state of ad libitum fed mice. At the same time, the transcriptome changes induced by CR in mice are enriched among genes showing age-related changes in primates, concentrated in specific expression patterns, and can be linked with specific functional pathways, including insulin signalling, cancer, and the immune response. These findings indicate that the evolution of human longevity was likely independent of CR-induced lifespan extension mechanisms. Consequently, application of CR or CR-mimicking agents may yet offer a promising direction for the extension of healthy human lifespan."

The time course study of plasma samples from Patient H, a well-characterized case of post-transfusion hepatitis C, showed that ""1H8-like"" antibodies could be detected in a sample collected almost two years after the initial infection, thus confirming the immunogenicity of this epitope in vivo.

In sera and urine of mCD109-TG mice, mCD109 was detected using western blotting. In xenografted mice, hCD109 secreted from inoculated tumors was detected in sera, using western blotting and CD109 ELISA. Concentrations of tumor-secreted CD109 increased proportionally as tumors enlarged. Concentrations of secreted CD109 decreased notably by 17 h after tumor resection, and became undetectable 48 h after resection. The half-life of tumor-secreted CD109 was about 5.86±0.17 h. These results indicate that CD109 is present in serum as a soluble form, and suggest its potential as a novel tumor marker in patients with cancers that express CD109."

Only 24.7% of the respondents possessed the knowledge of how to correctly manage fractured teeth. Only 23.6% of them knew how to manage displaced teeth. 62.5% of them correctly answered that knocked-out deciduous teeth should not be replanted to the original position, but few of them (23.6%) knew that permanent teeth should be replanted. Moreover, 37.1% of the respondents correctly identified at least one of the appropriate media for storing a knocked-out tooth. First-aid training and acquisition of dental injury information from other sources were significant factors that positive responses from these questions would lead to higher scores. Conclusion Hong Kong secondary school students' knowledge of emergency management of dental trauma is considered insufficient. An educational campaign in secondary schools dedicated to students is recommended. Prior first-aid training and acquisition of dental injury information from other sources positively relate to the level of knowledge. Dental trauma emergency management is recommended to be added to first-aid publications and be taught to students and health professionals.Trial Registration: Hong Kong Clinical Trial Centre HKCTR-1344"

The World Health Organization (WHO) needs to lead in solving this problem by working with research institutions, journal editors and funding agencies to document the degree of inequity and to impose penalties for failures to collaborate."
https://openalex.org/W2094417874,"The cross-talk between insulin and angiotensin II signalling pathways plays a significant role in the co-occurrence of diabetes and hypertension. We developed a mathematical model of the system of interactions among the biomolecules that are involved in the cross-talk between the insulin and angiotensin II signalling pathways. We have identified several feedback structures that regulate the dynamic behavior of the individual signalling pathways and their interactions. Different scenarios are simulated and dominant steady-state, dynamic and stability characteristics are revealed. The proposed mechanistic model describes how angiotensin II inhibits the actions of insulin and impairs the insulin-mediated vasodilation. The model also predicts that poor glycaemic control induced by diabetes contributes to hypertension by activating the renin angiotensin aystem."
https://openalex.org/W1996193959,"Background and Aim A neuronal pathway participates in the development of portal hypertension: blockade of afferent sensory nerves in portal vein ligated (PVL) rats simultaneously prevents brain cardiovascular regularory nuclei activation, neuromodulator overexpression in superior mesenteric ganglia, sympathetic atrophy of mesenteric innervation and hemodynamic alterations. Here we investigated in PVL rats alterations in neuromodulators and signaling pathways leading to axonal regression or apoptosis in the superior mesenteric ganglia and tested the effects of the stimulation of neuronal proliferation/survival by using a tyrosine kinase receptor A agonist, gambogic amide. Results The neuronal pathway was confirmed by an increased neuronal afferent activity at the vagal nodose ganglia and the presence of semaphorin3A in sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons at the intermediolateral nucleus of the spinal cord of PVL rats. Expression of the active form of tyrosine kinase receptor A (phosphorylated), leading to proliferation and survival signaling, showed a significant reduction in PVL comparing to sham rats. In contrast, the apoptotic and axonal retraction pathways were stimulated in PVL, demonstrated by a significant overexpression of semaphorin 3A and its receptor neuropilin1, together with increases of cleaved caspase7, inactive poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and Rho kinase expression. Finally, the administration of gambogic amide in PVL rats showed an amelioration of hemodynamic alterations and sympathetic atrophy, through the activation of survival pathways together with the inhibition of apoptotic cascades and Rho kinase mediated axonal regression. Conclusion The adrenergic alteration and sympathetic atrophy in mesenteric vessels during portal hypertension is caused by alterations on neuromodulation leading to post-ganglionic sympathetic regression and apoptosis and contributing to splanchnic vasodilation."
https://openalex.org/W2056540400,"Daphnia pulex, the crustacean with the first sequenced genome, is an important organism that has been widely used in ecological and toxicological research. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21–25 nucleotide small non-coding RNAs that are involved in a myriad of physiological processes. In this research, we predicted 75 D. pulex miRNAs by sequence homology and secondary structure identification from the full genome sequence. Fourteen predicted miRNAs were selected for quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) validation. Out of these, eight (mir-8, mir-9, mir-12, mir-92, mir-100, mir-133, mir-153 and mir-283) were successfully amplified and validated. Next, expression levels were quantified at three different life stages (days 4, 8 and 12 of age) using U6 spliceosomal RNA as a reference gene. The expression of mir-8, mir-9, mir-12, mir-92 and mir-100 significantly differed across time suggesting these microRNAs might play a critical role during D. pulex development. This is the first study to identify and validate miRNAs in D. pulex, which is an important first step in further studies that evaluate their roles in development and response to environmental and ecological stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2029720563,"Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a protein found associated with high density lipoprotein (HDL), thought to prevent oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). This enzyme has been implicated in lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease. Anoxia-reoxygenation and oxidative stress are important elements in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. However, the role of PON1 in anoxia-reoxygenation or anoxic injury is unclear. We hypothesize that PON1 prevents anoxia-reoxygenation injury. We set out to determine whether PON1 expression in Drosophila melanogaster protects against anoxia-reoxygenation (A-R) induced injury.Wild type (WT) and transgenic PON1 flies were exposed to anoxia (100% Nitrogen) for different time intervals (from 1 to 24 hours). After the anoxic period, flies were placed in room air for reoxygenation. Activity and survival of flies was then recorded.Within 5 minutes of anoxia, all flies fell into a stupor state. After reoxygenation, survivor flies resumed activity with some delay. Interestingly, transgenic flies recovered from stupor later than WT. PON1 transgenic flies had a significant survival advantage after A-R stress compared with WT. The protection conferred by PON1 expression was present regardless of the age or dietary restriction. Furthermore, PON1 expression exclusively in CNS conferred protection.Our results support the hypothesis that PON1 has a protective role in anoxia-reoxygenation injury, and its expression in the CNS is sufficient and necessary to provide a 100% survival protection."
https://openalex.org/W2325078472,"Introduction Air from animal feeding operations (AFOs) has been shown to transport numerous contaminants of public health concern. While federal statutes like the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) generally require that facilities report hazardous releases, AFOs have been exempted from most of these requirements by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We assessed the availability of information about AFO airborne hazardous releases following these exemptions. Methods We submitted public records requests to 7 states overlapping with or adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay watershed for reports of hazardous releases made by AFOs under EPCRA. From the records received, we calculated the proportion of AFOs in each state for which ≥1 reports were available. We also determined the availability of specific types of information required under EPCRA. The numbers of AFOs permitted under the Clean Water Act (CWA) or analogous state laws, as determined from permitting databases obtained from states, were used as denominators. Results We received both EPCRA reports and permitting databases from 4 of 7 states. Across these 4 states, the mean proportion of AFOs for which ≥1 EPCRA reports were available was 15% (range: 2-33%). The mean proportions of AFOs for which the name or identity of the substance released, ≥1 estimates of quantity released, and information about nearby population density and sensitive populations were available were 15% (range: 2-33%), 8% (range: 0-22%), and 14% (range: 2-8%), respectively. Discussion These results suggest that information about the airborne hazardous releases of a large majority of AFOs is not available under federal law in the states that we investigated. While the results cannot be attributed to specific factors by this method, attention to multiple factors, including revision of the EPA’s exemptions, may increase the availability of information relevant to the health of populations living or working near AFOs."
