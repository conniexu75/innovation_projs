https://openalex.org/W3108147153,"Rapid phasic activity of midbrain dopamine neurons is thought to signal reward prediction errors (RPEs), resembling temporal difference errors used in machine learning. However, recent studies describing slowly increasing dopamine signals have instead proposed that they represent state values and arise independent from somatic spiking activity. Here we developed experimental paradigms using virtual reality that disambiguate RPEs from values. We examined dopamine circuit activity at various stages, including somatic spiking, calcium signals at somata and axons, and striatal dopamine concentrations. Our results demonstrate that ramping dopamine signals are consistent with RPEs rather than value, and this ramping is observed at all stages examined. Ramping dopamine signals can be driven by a dynamic stimulus that indicates a gradual approach to a reward. We provide a unified computational understanding of rapid phasic and slowly ramping dopamine signals: dopamine neurons perform a derivative-like computation over values on a moment-by-moment basis."
https://openalex.org/W3107234539,"A nationwide survey of dentists was carried out in Brazil, a new pandemic epicenter, to analyze how dental care coverage has been affected in public versus private networks, changes in routine and burdens, and how local prevalence of COVID-19 affects dental professionals. Dentists were recruited via email and Instagram®. Responses to a pre-tested questionnaire were collected May 15–24, 2020. COVID-19 case/death counts in the state where respondents work was used to test associations between contextual status and decreases in weekly appointments, fear of contracting COVID-19 at work, and current work status (α = 0.05). Over 10 days, 3,122 responses were received (response rate ~2.1%) from all Brazilian states. Work status was affected for 94%, with less developed regions being more impacted. The pandemic impact on clinical routine was high/very high for 84%, leading to varied changes to clinic infrastructure, personal protective equipment use, and patient screening, as well as increased costs. COVID-19 patients had been seen by 5.3% of respondents; 90% reported fearing contracting COVID-19 at work. Multilevel models showed that greater case and death rates (counted as 1000 cases and 100 deaths per million inhabitants) in one’s state increased the odds of being fearful of contracting the disease (18% and 25%). For each additional 1000 cases/100 deaths, the odds of currently not working or treating only emergencies increased by 36% and 58%. The reduction in patients seen weekly was significantly greater in public (38.7±18.6) than in private clinics (22.5±17.8). This study provides early evidence of three major impacts of the pandemic on dentistry: increasing inequalities due to coverage differences between public and private networks; the adoption of new clinical routines, which are associated with an economic burden for dentists; and associations of regional COVID-19 incidence/mortality with fear of contracting the disease at work."
https://openalex.org/W3110596553,"Background Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has not only spawned a lot of stigma and discrimination towards its survivors but also to their corpses. We aimed to assess the magnitude and correlates of stigma in these survivors, on return to their communities. Methods This was a cross-sectional, hospital-based, exploratory study conducted by the postgraduate department of psychiatry, in collaboration with the postgraduate department of chest medicine, Govt. medical college, Srinagar. The study was performed among COVID-19 survivors, who attended the outpatient department after their discharge from the hospital. Socio-demographic characteristics were recorded through semi-structured proforma. Stigma was measured by the stigma questionnaire. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Results A total of 91 survivors consented to participate in the study. Almost half (46.2%) of them were in the age group of 30–49 years and close to two-thirds (68.1%) were males. About three–fourths (74.7%) were from the urban background. The mean time from hospital discharge to study entry was 11.7±5.1 [Range(R) = 7–21] days. 98% of survivors provided at least one stigma endorsing response and the total mean stigma score was 28.5±7.1[R = 6–39]. The mean stigma sub-scores were highest for enacted stigma (7.6±1.8) [R = 2–9] and externalized stigma (15.0±4.1) [R = 1–20]. Enacted stigma was significantly high in males as compared to females. Enacted stigma and internalized stigma were both associated with education. Enacted stigma, externalized stigma, disclosure concerns, and total stigma was significantly associated with the occupation. Being unemployed and time since discharge were identified as independent predictors of total stigma. Conclusion Our study results showed high levels of enacted and externalized stigma among COVID-19 survivors. Enacted stigma was more among males and in those who were highly educated. Survivor centered and community-driven anti-stigma programs are the need of the hour to promote the recovery and community re-integration of these survivors."
https://openalex.org/W3109449174,"We examined the effect of a labile soil amendment, compost, and recalcitrant biochar on soil microbial community structure, diversity, and activity during turfgrass establishment. Two application rates of biochar (B1 at 12.5 t ha -1 and B2 at 25 t ha -1 ), a 5 centimeter (cm) green waste compost treatment (CM) in top soil, a treatment with 12.5 t ha -1 biochar and 5 cm compost (B1+CM), and an unamended control (CK) treatment were prepared and seeded with tall fescue. Overall, results of phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) profiling and Illumina high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes amplified from soil DNA revealed significant shifts in microbial community structures in the compost amended soils whereas in biochar amended soils communities were more similar to the control, unamended soil. Similarly, increases in enzymatic rates (6–56%) and nitrogen-induced respiration (94%) were all largest in compost amended soils, with biochar amended soils exhibiting similar patterns to the control soils. Both biochar and compost amendments impacted microbial community structures and functions, but compost amendment, whether applied alone or co-applied with biochar, exhibited the strongest shifts in the microbial community metrics examined. Our results suggest application of compost to soils in need of microbiome change (reclamation projects) or biochar when the microbiome is functioning and long-term goals such as carbon sequestration are more desirable."
https://openalex.org/W3033326221,"When industrial robots are adopted by firms in a local labor market, some workers are displaced and become unemployed. Other workers that are not directly affected by automation may however fear that these new technologies might replace their working tasks in the future. This fear of a possible future replacement is important because it negatively affects workers’ job satisfaction at present. This paper studies the extent to which automation affects workers’ job satisfaction, and whether this effect differs for high- versus low-skilled workers. The empirical analysis uses microdata for several thousand workers in Norway from the Working Life Barometer survey for the period 2016–2019, combined with information on the introduction of industrial robots in Norway from the International Federation of Robotics. Our identification strategy exploits variation in the pace of introduction of industrial robots in Norwegian regions and industries since 2007 to instrument workers’ fear of replacement. The results indicate that automation in industrial firms in recent years have induced 40% of the workers that are currently in employment to fear that their work might be replaced by a smart machine in the future. Such fear of future replacement does negatively affect workers’ job satisfaction at present. This negative effect is driven by low-skilled workers, which are those carrying out routine-based tasks, and who are therefore more exposed to the risks of automation."
https://openalex.org/W3107563688,"Introduction Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect over 5.7 million Americans and over 35 million people worldwide. Detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early ADRD is a challenge to clinicians and researchers. Brief assessment tools frequently emphasize memory impairment, however executive dysfunction may be one of the earliest signs of impairment. To address the need for a brief, easy-to-score, open-access test of executive function for use in clinical practice and research, we created the Number Symbol Coding Task (NSCT). Methods This study analyzed 320 consecutive patient-caregiver dyads who underwent a comprehensive evaluation including the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), patient and caregiver versions of the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS), caregiver ratings of behavior and function, and neuropsychological testing, with a subset undergoing volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Estimates of cognitive reserve were calculated using education, combined indices of education and occupation, and verbal IQ. Psychometric properties of the NSCT including data quality, data distribution, floor and ceiling effects, construct and known-groups validity, discriminability, and clinical profiles were determined. Results The patients had a mean age of 75.3±9.2 years (range 38-98y) with a mean education of 15.7±2.8 years (range 6-26y) of education. The patients had a mean CDR-SB of 4.8±4.7 (range 0–18) and a mean MoCA score of 18.6±7.1 (range 1–30). The mean NSCT score was 30.1±13.8 and followed a normal distribution. All healthy controls and MCI cases were able to complete the NSCT. The NSCT showed moderate-to-strong correlations with clinical and neuropsychological measures with the strongest association (all p’s &lt; .001) for measures with executive components (e.g., Judgement and Problem Solving box of the CDR, Decision Making and Problem Solving domain of the QDRS, Trailmaking B, and Cognigram Attention and Executive Composite Scores). Women slightly outperformed men, and individuals with lower educational attainment and lower education-occupation indices had lower NSCT scores. Decreasing NSCT scores corresponded to older age, worse cognitive scores, higher CDR sum of boxes scores, worse caregiver ratings of function and behavior, worse patient and informant QDRS ratings, and smaller hippocampal volumes and hippocampal occupancy scores. The NSCT provided excellent discrimination (AUC: .866; 95% CI: .82-.91) with a cut-off score of 36 providing the best combination of sensitivity (0.880) and specificity (0.759). Combining the NSCT with patient QDRS and caregiver QDRS ratings improved discrimination (AUC: .908; 95% CI: .87-.94). Discussion The NSCT is a brief, 90-second executive task that incorporates attention, planning and set-switching that can be completed by individuals into the moderate-to-severe stages of dementia. The NSCT may be a useful tool for dementia screening, case-ascertainment in epidemiological or community-based ADRD studies, and in busy primary care settings where time is limited. Combining the NSCT with a brief structured interview tool such as the QDRS may provide excellent power to detect cognitive impairment. The NSCT performed well in comparison to standardized scales of a comprehensive cognitive neurology evaluation across a wide array of sociodemographic variables in a brief fashion that could facilitate its use in clinical care and research."

https://openalex.org/W3108463943,"Introduction This study aimed to assess the prevalence, sociodemographic factors, reproductive consequences, and heritable disease burdens associated with consanguineous marriage (CM) in Bangladesh. Methods A total of 7,312 families, including 3,694 CM-families, were recruited from 102 locales of 58 districts of Bangladesh. Using a standard questionnaire, we collected medical history and background sociodemographic data of these families. Family history was assessed by pedigree analysis. Fertility, mortality, secondary sex ratio, selection intensity, lethal equivalents were measured using standard methods. Results The mean prevalence of CM in our studied population was 6.64%. Gross fertility was higher among CM families, as compared to the non-CM families ( p &lt; 0.05). The rate of under-5 child (U5) mortality was significantly higher among CM families (16.6%) in comparison with the non-CM families (5.8%) ( p &lt; 0.01). We observed a persuasive rise of abortion/miscarriage and U5 mortality rates with the increasing level of inbreeding. The value of lethal equivalents per gamete found elevated for autosomal inheritances as compared to sex-linked inheritance. CM was associated with the incidence of several single-gene and multifactorial diseases, and congenital malformations, including bronchial asthma, hearing defect, heart diseases, sickle cell anemia ( p &lt; 0.05). The general attitude and perception toward CM were rather indifferent, and very few people were concerned about its genetic burden. Conclusion This study highlights the harmful consequences of CM on reproductive behavior and the incidence of hereditary conditions. It essences the need for genetic counseling from premarital to postnatal levels in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3108711931,"In health systems with strongly developed primary care, such as in the Netherlands, effectively engaging primary care professionals (PCPs) in suicide prevention is a key strategy. As part of the national Suicide Prevention Action Network (SUPRANET), a program was offered to PCPs in six regions in the Netherlands in 2017–2018 to more effectively engage them in suicide prevention. This implementation study aimed to evaluate to what extent SUPRANET was helpful in supporting PCPs to apply suicide prevention practices. From March to May 2018, 21 semi-structured interviews have been carried out with PCPs and other non-clinical professionals from SUPRANET regions in the Netherlands. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using the grounded theory approach. Data was structured using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, which enabled identifying facilitating and challenging factors for PCPs to carry out suicide prevention practices. An important challenge included difficulties in assessing suicide risk (intervention characteristics) due to PCPs’ self-perceived incompetence, burdensomeness of suicide and limited time and heavy workload of PCPs. Another important limitation was collaboration with mental health care (outer setting), whereas mental health nurses (inner setting) and SUPRANET (implementation process) were facilitating factors for applying suicide prevention practices. With regard to SUPRANET, especially the training was positively evaluated by PCPs. PCPs expressed a strong need for improving collaboration with specialized mental health care, which was not provided by SUPRANET. Educating PCPs on suicide prevention seems beneficial, but is not sufficient to improve care for suicidal patients. Effective suicide prevention also requires improved liaison between mental health services and primary care, and should therefore be the focus of future suicide prevention strategies aimed at primary care."
https://openalex.org/W3107348352,"Background Sub-epithelial fibrosis is a characteristic feature of airway remodeling in asthma which correlates with disease severity. Current asthma medications are ineffective in treating fibrosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mitochondrial phenotype in fibroblasts isolated from airway biopsies of non-asthmatic and severe asthmatic subjects by examining mitophagy as a mechanism contributing to fibroblast persistence and thereby, fibrosis in severe asthma. Methods Bioinformatics analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data was performed to identify the top enriched pathways in asthmatic fibroblasts. Endogenous expression of mitophagy markers in severe asthmatic and non-asthmatic fibroblasts was determined using qRT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence. Mitophagy flux was examined by using lysosomal protease inhibitors, E64d and pepstatin A. Mitochondrial membrane potential and metabolic activity were also evaluated using JC-1 assay and MTT assay, respectively. Results Bioinformatics analysis revealed the enrichment of Pink/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in asthmatic fibroblasts compared to healthy controls. In severe asthmatic fibroblasts, the differential expression of mitophagy genes, PINK1 and PRKN, was accompanied by the accumulation of PINK1, Parkin and other mitophagy proteins at baseline. The further accumulation of endogenous LC3BII, p62 and PINK1 in the presence of E64d and pepstatin A in severe asthmatic fibroblasts reinforced their enhanced mitophagy flux. Significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and metabolic activity were also demonstrated at baseline confirming the impairment in mitochondrial function in severe asthmatic fibroblasts. Interestingly, these fibroblasts displayed neither an apoptotic nor senescent phenotype but a pro-fibrotic phenotype with an adaptive survival mechanism triggered by increased AMPKα phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Conclusions Our results demonstrated a role for mitophagy in the pathogenesis of severe asthma where the enhanced turnover of damaged mitochondria may contribute to fibrosis in severe asthma by promoting the persistence and pro-fibrotic phenotype of fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W3109253219,"Surface sterilization of seeds is a key step in providing microorganisms-free seeds for numerous applications like understanding the role of seed-borne microorganisms in plant development, studying microbial cells-plant interactions by inoculating model microorganisms in a simplified system or selective cultivation of seed endobionts. However applying efficient treatment for surface sterilization of seeds without affecting the plant growth is not an easy task. In this study we aimed to provide an efficient surface sterilization treatment for maize seeds using i) hydrogen peroxide (HP), ii) sodium hypochlorite (SH) and iii) ethanol-sodium hypochlorite (EtOH-SH) under stirring (st) and vacuum-stirring (va-st) conditions. We used fluorescence microscopy and ultra-high resolution Helium Ion Microscopy (HIM) as powerful imaging approaches in combination with macroscopic techniques to visualize, quantify and evaluate the efficiency of seed sterilization, quality of root germination, seedlings and root hair development as well as the presence or absence of microorganisms on the root surface. Our results showed a strong reduction in microbial cell numbers of 4 orders of magnitude after the EtOH-SH treatments. Moreover, seeds exposed to EtOH-SH treatments displayed the lowest percentage of microbial growth (50%) and the highest percentage of germinated seeds (100%) compared to other sterilization treatments. HIM imaging proved the absence of microbial cells on the roots grown from seeds exposed to EtOH-SH treatments. Moreover, root hair development seemed not to be affected by any of the sterilization treatments. Our findings demonstrated that EtOH-SH treatments are significantly reducing the abundance of microbial cells from the surface of maize seeds and can be used with high confidence in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3109677656,"Representative learning design proposes that a training task should represent informational constraints present within a competitive environment. To assess the level of representativeness of a training task, the frequency and interaction of constraints should be measured. This study compared constraint interactions and their frequencies in training (match simulations and small sided games) with competition environments in elite Australian football. The extent to which constraints influenced kick and handball effectiveness between competition matches, match simulations and small sided games was determined. The constraints of pressure and time in possession were assessed, alongside disposal effectiveness, through an association rule algorithm. These rules were then expanded to determine whether a disposal was influenced by the preceding disposal. Disposal type differed between training and competition environments, with match simulations yielding greater representativeness compared to small sided games. The subsequent disposal was generally more effective in small sided games compared to the match simulations and competition matches. These findings offer insight into the measurement of representative learning designs through the non-linear modelling of constraint interactions. The analytical techniques utilised may assist other practitioners with the design and monitoring of training tasks intended to facilitate skill transfer from preparation to competition."
https://openalex.org/W3108716016,"The cocaine vaccine dAd5GNE is comprised of a disrupted serotype 5 adenovirus gene therapy vector covalently conjugated to the cocaine analog GNE. The vaccine evokes a high titer of circulating anti-cocaine antibodies that prevent cocaine from reaching its cognate receptors in the central nervous system. Prior studies have demonstrated the efficacy of dAd5GNE in models of occasional, moderate cocaine use. However, previous studies have not sufficiently evaluated the efficacy of dAd5GNE in models of the repetitive and high-dose “binge” use patterns common in human addicts. In the present study, we evaluated the capacity of dAd5GNE vaccination to protect against “binge” cocaine use and circumstances where vaccinated addicts attempt to override the vaccine. We modeled repetitive daily cocaine use in vaccinated Balb/c mice and African green monkeys, and evaluated high-dose “binge” scenarios in Balb/c mice. In each model of daily use the dAd5GNE vaccine prevented cocaine from reaching the central nervous system. In the high-dose “binge” model, vaccination decreased cocaine-induced hyperactivity and reduced the number of cocaine-induced seizures. Based on this data and our prior data in rodents and nonhuman primates, we have initiated a clinical trial evaluating the dAd5GNE anti-cocaine vaccine as a potential therapy for cocaine addicts who wish to stop cocaine use. If dAd5GNE vaccination is safe and produces high anti-cocaine antibody titers in the clinic, we hypothesize that the vaccine will restrict the access of cocaine to the central nervous system and inhibit cocaine-induced “highs” even in the context of moderate daily and high-dose “binge” use that might otherwise cause a drug-induced overdose."
https://openalex.org/W3108193113,"Introduction No prospective studies have examined the prevalence, antecedents or concurrent characteristics associated with self-harm in non-treatment-seeking primary school-aged children. Methods In this cohort study from Melbourne, Australia we assessed 1239 children annually from age 8–9 years (wave 1) to 11–12 years (wave 4) on a range of health, social, educational and family measures. Past-year self-harm was assessed at wave 4. We estimated the prevalence of self-harm and used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations with concurrent and antecedent factors. Results 28 participants (3% of the 1059 with self-harm data; 18 girls [3%], 10 boys [2%]) reported self-harm at age 11–12 years. Antecedent (waves 1–3) predictors of self-harm were: persistent symptoms of depression (sex-age-socioeconomic status adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 7.8; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 2.6 to 24) or anxiety (aOR: 5.1; 95%CI 2.1 to 12), frequent bullying victimisation (aOR: 24.6; 95%CI 3.8 to 158), and recent alcohol consumption (aOR: 2.9; 95%CI 1.2 to 7.1). Concurrent (wave 4) associations with self-harm were: having few friends (aOR: 8.7; 95%CI 3.2 to 24), poor emotional control (aOR: 4.2; 95%CI 1.9 to 9.6), antisocial behaviour (theft—aOR: 3.1; 95%CI 1.2 to 7.9; carrying a weapon—aOR: 6.9; 95%CI 3.1 to 15), and being in mid-puberty (aOR: 6.5; 95%CI 1.5 to 28) or late/post-puberty (aOR: 14.4; 95%CI 2.9 to 70). Conclusions The focus of intervention efforts aimed at preventing and reducing adolescent self-harm should extend to primary school-aged children, with a focus on mental health and peer relationships during the pubertal transition."
https://openalex.org/W3110301833,"Objective To reconstruct the transmission trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the effects of control measures in China. Methods Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and proportional estimation method to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A testing capacity limitation factor for medical resources was imposed to model the number of infected but not quarantined individuals. Baidu migration data were used to assess the number of infected individuals who migrated from Wuhan to other areas. Results Basic reproduction number, R 0 , was 3.6 before the city was lockdown on Jan 23, 2020. The actual infected number the model predicted was 4508 in Wuhan before Jan 23, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan,) and 3.3 (China except Hubei) in stage 1 (from Dec 08, 2019 to Jan 22, 2020) to 0.67 (Wuhan), 0.59 (Hubei except Wuhan) and 0.63 (China except Hubei) respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan. By early April, there would be 42073 (95% confidence interval, 41673 to 42475), 21342 (95% confidence interval, 21057 to 21629) and 13384 (95% confidence interval, 13158 to 13612) infected cases in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei), respectively. Conclusion A series of control measures in China have effectively prevented the spread of COVID-19, and the epidemic should be under control in early April with very few new cases occasionally reported."
https://openalex.org/W3108462472,"Ecosystem effects of bottom trawl fisheries are of major concern. Although it is prohibited to catch fish using electricity in European Union waters, a number of beam trawlers obtained a derogation and switched to pulse trawling to explore the potential to reduce impacts. Here we analyse whether using electrical rather than mechanical stimulation results in an overall reduction in physical disturbance of the seafloor in the beam-trawl fishery for sole Solea solea . We extend and apply a recently developed assessment framework to the Dutch beam-trawl fleet and show that the switch to pulse trawling substantially reduced benthic impacts when exploiting the total allowable catch of sole in the North Sea. Using Vessel Monitoring by Satellite and logbook data from 2009 to 2017, we estimate that the trawling footprint decreased by 23%, the precautionary impact indicator of the benthic community decreased by 39%, the impact on median longevity of the benthic community decreased by 20%, the impact on benthic biomass decreased by 61%, and the amount of sediment mobilised decreased by 39%. The decrease in impact is due to the replacement of tickler chains by electrode arrays, a lower towing speed and higher catch efficiency for sole. The effort and benthic physical disturbance of the beam-trawl fishery targeting plaice Pleuronectes platessa in the central North Sea increased with the recovery of the plaice stock. Our study illustrates the utility of a standardized methodological framework to assess the differences in time trends and physical disturbance between gears."
https://openalex.org/W3106770733,"Lyme disease patients would greatly benefit from a timely, sensitive, and specific molecular diagnostic test that can detect the causal agent Borrelia burgdorferi at the onset of symptoms. Currently available diagnostic methods recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for Lyme disease involve indirect serological tests that rely on the detection of a host-antibody response, which often takes more than three weeks to develop. With this process, many positive cases are not detected within a timely manner, preventing a complete cure. In this study, we have developed a digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that detects Lyme disease on clinical presentation with a sensitivity two-fold higher than that of the currently available diagnostic methods, using a cohort of patient samples collected from the Lyme disease endemic state of Connecticut, USA, in 2016–2018. Digital PCR technology was chosen as it is more advanced and sensitive than other PCR techniques in detecting rare targets. The analytical detection sensitivity of this diagnostic assay is approximately three genome copies of B . burgdorferi . The paucity of spirochetes in the bloodstream of Lyme disease patients has hindered the clinical adoption of PCR-based diagnostic tests. However, this drawback was overcome by using a comparatively larger sample volume, applying pre-analytical processing to the blood samples, and implementing a pre-amplification step to enrich for B . burgdorferi -specific gene targets before the patient samples are analyzed via digital PCR technology. Pre-analytical processing of blood samples from acute patients revealed that the best sample type for Lyme disease detection is platelet-rich plasma rather than whole blood. If detected in a timely manner, Lyme disease can be completely cured, thus limiting antibiotic overuse and associated morbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3106821179,"Background De-novo malignancies after kidney transplantation represent one major cause for mortality after transplantation. However, most of the studies are limited due to small sample size, short follow-up or lack of information about cancer specific mortality. Methods This long-term retrospective analysis included all adult patients with complete follow-up that underwent kidney transplantation between 1995 and 2016 at our centre. All patients with diagnosis of malignancy excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) were identified and a matched control group was assigned to the kidney transplant recipients with post-transplant malignancies. Results 1417 patients matched the inclusion criteria. 179 malignancies posttransplant were diagnosed in 154 patients (n = 21 with two, n = 2 patients with three different malignancies). Mean age at cancer diagnosis was 60.3±13.3 years. Overall incidence of de-novo malignancies except NMSC was 1% per year posttransplant. Renal cell carcinoma was the most common entity (n = 49, incidence 4.20 per 1000 patient years; cancer specific mortality 12%), followed by cancer of the gastro-intestinal tract (n = 30, 2.57; 50%), urinary system (n = 24, 2.06; 13%), respiratory system (n = 18, 1.54; 89%), female reproductive system (n = 15, 1.29; 13%), posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders and haematological tumours (n = 14, 1.20; 21%), cancers of unknown primary (n = 7, 0.60 100%) and others (n = 22, 1.89; 27%). Male sex, re-transplantation and time on dialysis were associated with de-novo malignancies after transplantation. Conclusion De-novo malignancies continue to be a serious problem after kidney transplantation. To improve long-term outcome after Kidney transplantation, prevention and cancer screening should be more tailored and intensified."
https://openalex.org/W3109852299,"Background and purpose Few tools are available to predict tumor response to treatment. This retrospective study assesses visual and automatic heterogeneity from 18 F-FDG PET images as predictors of response in locally advanced rectal cancer. Methods This study included 37 LARC patients who underwent an 18 F-FDG PET before their neoadjuvant therapy. One expert segmented the tumor from the PET images. Blinded to the patient´s outcome, two experts established by consensus a visual score for tumor heterogeneity. Metabolic and texture parameters were extracted from the tumor area. Multivariate binary logistic regression with cross-validation was used to estimate the clinical relevance of these features. Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of each model was evaluated. Histopathological tumor regression grade was the ground-truth. Results Standard metabolic parameters could discriminate 50.1% of responders (AUC = 0.685). Visual heterogeneity classification showed correct assessment of the response in 75.4% of the sample (AUC = 0.759). Automatic quantitative evaluation of heterogeneity achieved a similar predictive capacity (73.1%, AUC = 0.815). Conclusion A response prediction model in LARC based on tumor heterogeneity (assessed either visually or with automatic texture measurement) shows that texture features may complement the information provided by the metabolic parameters and increase prediction accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3110407784,"As the capital and one of the metropolises in China, Beijing has met with a number of serious so-called ""urban diseases"" in the process of rapid urbanization such as blind expansion of urban areas, explosion of population and the increase of urban heat island effect. To treat these “urban diseases” and make the metropolis develop healthful and sustainable in Beijing in the future, the spatial characteristics of metropolis developments in Beijing are explored in this paper. The urban built-up areas in Beijing are extracted using the DMSP-OLS nighttime light data from 1992 to 2013. The characteristics of the urban developments of Beijing are studied, including spatial and temporal scales of urban developments, urban barycenter of Beijing and its transfer trajectory, variations of urban spatial forms and the differences of urban internal developments. The results have shown that the built-up areas had been increasing and circling extending from the central urban areas to the outer spaces in the last 21 years. The built-up area had expanded by 878km 2 in 1992–2013, and the built-up area in 2013 had expanded to three times comparing to that of 1992. The expanding area of the built-up area in the northeast is the largest. The expansion of the urban had mainly occurred in 1996–2007, and the expanded area had accounted for 92% of the total research period. During the whole research period, the urban barycenter of Beijing had moved 5000.71 meters towards Northeast 28° of its original place from Dongcheng District to Chaoyang District. The development level of each municipal district had been increasing year by year, and the development differences among the municipal districts had been gradually reduced; the spatial forms of Beijing had been alternately changed between extensive and intensive expansion. The results of this study can help to plan urban land use and people migration of Beijing."
https://openalex.org/W3109136428,"Rationale The beta-O-linkage of N-acetylglucosamine (i.e., O-GlcNAc) to proteins is a pro-adaptive response to cellular insults. To this end, increased protein O-GlcNAcylation improves short-term survival of cardiomyocytes subjected to acute injury. This observation has been repeated by multiple groups and in multiple models; however, whether increased protein O-GlcNAcylation plays a beneficial role in more chronic settings remains an open question. Objective Here, we queried whether increasing levels of cardiac protein O-GlcNAcylation would be beneficial during infarct-induced heart failure. Methods and results To achieve increased protein O-GlcNAcylation, we targeted Oga , the gene responsible for removing O-GlcNAc from proteins. Here, we generated mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted, tamoxifen-inducible haploinsufficient Oga gene. In the absence of infarction, we observed a slight reduction in ejection fraction in Oga deficient mice. Overall, Oga reduction had no major impact on ventricular function. In additional cohorts, mice of both sexes and both genotypes were subjected to infarct-induced heart failure and followed for up to four weeks, during which time cardiac function was assessed via echocardiography. Contrary to our prediction, the Oga deficient mice exhibited exacerbated—not improved—cardiac function at one week following infarction. When the observation was extended to 4 wk post-MI, this acute exacerbation was lost. Conclusions The present findings, coupled with our previous work, suggest that altering the ability of cardiomyocytes to either add or remove O-GlcNAc modifications to proteins exacerbates early infarct-induced heart failure. We speculate that more nuanced approaches to regulating O-GlcNAcylation are needed to understand its role—and, in particular, the possibility of cycling, in the pathophysiology of the failing heart."
https://openalex.org/W3110025348,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genomic loci with candidate modifiers of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, but only a small proportion of the expected genetic contribution is accounted for at these loci. We leveraged expression data from CF cohorts, and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) reference data sets from multiple human tissues to generate predictive models, which were used to impute transcriptional regulation from genetic variance in our GWAS population. The imputed gene expression was tested for association with CF lung disease severity. By comparing and combining results from alternative approaches, we identified 379 candidate modifier genes. We delved into 52 modifier candidates that showed consensus between approaches, and 28 of them were near known GWAS loci. A number of these genes are implicated in the pathophysiology of CF lung disease (e.g., immunity, infection, inflammation, HLA pathways, glycosylation, and mucociliary clearance) and the CFTR protein biology (e.g., cytoskeleton, microtubule, mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi, and ubiquitination). Gene set enrichment results are consistent with current knowledge of CF lung disease pathogenesis. HLA Class II genes on chr6, and CEP72 , EXOC3 , and TPPP near the GWAS peak on chr5 are most consistently associated with CF lung disease severity across the tissues tested. The results help to prioritize genes in the GWAS regions, predict direction of gene expression regulation, and identify new candidate modifiers throughout the genome for potential therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W3107274007,"Canine neuropathic pain (NeuP) has been poorly investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the pain burden, sensory profile and inflammatory cytokines in dogs with naturally-occurring NeuP. Twenty-nine client-owned dogs with NeuP were included in a prospective, partially masked, randomized crossover clinical trial, and treated with gabapentin/placebo/gabapentin-meloxicam or gabapentin-meloxicam/placebo/gabapentin (each treatment block of 7 days; total 21 days). Pain scores, mechanical (MNT) and electrical (ENT) nociceptive thresholds and descending noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) were assessed at baseline, days 7, 14, and 21. DNIC was evaluated using ΔMNT (after-before conditioning stimulus). Positive or negative ΔMNT corresponded to inhibitory or facilitatory pain profiles, respectively. Pain scores were recorded using the Client Specific Outcome Measures (CSOM), Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI), and short-form Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale (CMPS-SF). Data from baseline were compared to those of sixteen healthy controls. ΔMNT, but not MNT and ENT, was significantly larger in controls (2.3 ± 0.9 N) than in NeuP (-0.2 ± 0.7 N). The percentage of dogs with facilitatory sensory profile was similar at baseline and after placebo (61.5–63%), and between controls and after gabapentin (33.3–34.6%). The CBPI scores were significantly different between gabapentin (CBPI pain and CBPI overall impression ) and/or gabapentin-meloxicam (CBPI pain and interference ) when compared with baseline, but not placebo. The CBPI scores were not significantly different between placebo and baseline. The concentration of cytokines was not different between groups or treatments. Dogs with NeuP have deficient inhibitory pain mechanisms. Pain burden was reduced after gabapentin and/or gabapentin-meloxicam when compared with baseline using CBPI and CMPS-SF scores. However, these scores were not superior than placebo, nor placebo was superior to baseline evaluations. A caregiver placebo effect may have biased the results."

An experimental examination of steering automation failure shows that response latency, variability and corrective manoeuvring systematically depend on failure severity and the cognitive load of the driver. The results are formalised into a probabilistic predictive model of response latencies that accounts for failure severity, cognitive load and variability within and between drivers. The model predicts high rates of unsafe outcomes in plausible automation failure scenarios. These findings underline that understanding variability in failure responses is crucial for understanding outcomes in automation failures."
https://openalex.org/W3108706568,"Introduction Radiation-induced lymphopenia (RIL) occurs during treatment with conventional radiation in multiple organ sites. Development of RIL portends poor prognosis. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) spares RIL in pancreatic cancer, but has not been examined in other sites commonly treated with SBRT. This work examines if SBRT similarly spares RIL in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and methods Retrospective analysis was done at a single institution on 40 distinct cases of SBRT for early stage NSCLC from 2006–2017. Incidentally collected lymphocyte counts collected within 6 months of SBRT treatment were analyzed to determine if RIL occurred. The presence of RIL was correlated with location of initial failure and survival endpoints. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed with significance defined at the level p &lt; 0.05. Results RIL was observed in 35% of the analyzed patients. Patterns of failure and survival data were comparable to prior SBRT literature. There was no observed association in two year local, nodal, or distant failure, progression free survival, or overall survival based on the presence of RIL. Discussion SBRT spares RIL in NSCLC compared to historical rates observed with conventionally fractionated radiation. As understanding of the role of the immune system in cancer control continues to evolve, the importance of RIL sparing techniques take on increasing importance. This study represents further analysis of RIL sparing in SBRT in an early stage NSCLC cohort without the confounding influence of chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3109203781,"Regime shifts are increasingly prevalent in the ecological literature. However, definitions vary and detection methods are still developing. Here, we employ a novel statistical algorithm based on the Bayesian online change-point detection framework to simultaneously identify shifts in the mean and (or) variance of time series data. We detected multiple regime shifts in long-term (59–154 years) patterns of coastal Norwegian Atlantic cod (&gt;70% decline) and putative drivers of cod productivity: North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO); sea-surface temperature; zooplankton abundance; fishing mortality ( F ). The consequences of an environmental or climate-related regime shift on cod productivity are accentuated when regime shifts coincide, fishing mortality is high, and populations are small. The analyses suggest that increasing F increasingly sensitized cod in the mid 1970s and late 1990s to regime shifts in NAO, zooplankton abundance, and water temperature. Our work underscores the necessity of accounting for human-induced mortality in regime shift analyses of marine ecosystems."

An ethnically homogeneous group of 6,028 adult women from large Polish cities, born in 1931–2001, living between 1931 and 2020, were examined using the same research methods and research equipment. All women were divided into eight birth cohorts. The Kruskal-Wallis test and multiple regression analyses were used. Root Mean Square Standardized Effect (RMSSE), critical value of the test, and test power were calculated. The average height of women born during 70 years of the study increased by 9.63 cm, from 158.22 cm (SD = 5.57 cm) to 167.85 cm (SD = 6.91 cm) (H = 1084.84, p&lt;0.001). The intensity of the intergenerational trend in subsequent cohorts of years of birth varied strongly between decades, averaging 1.34 cm/decade. The body height in women increased significantly up to the height of those born between 1970 and 1979 and then the trend weakened noticeably, although it remained positive. The observed secular trend confirms positive changes in the standard of living of Polish women between 1931 and 2020. Improving living conditions allow people to fully achieve their genetically determined growth potential."
https://openalex.org/W3109300667,"This study aimed to investigate the impact of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) on 3-year clinical outcomes in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients without a history of hypertension who underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES). A total of 13,104 AMI patients who were registered in the Korea AMI registry (KAMIR)-National Institutes of Health (NIH) were included in the study. The primary endpoint was 3-year major adverse cardiac events (MACE), which was defined as the composite of all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), and any repeat revascularization. To adjust baseline potential confounders, an inverse probability weighting (IPTW) analysis was performed. The patients were divided into two groups: the ACEI group, n = 4,053 patients and the ARB group, n = 4,107 patients. During the 3-year clinical follow-up, the cumulative incidences of MACE (hazard ratio [HR], 0.843; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.740–0.960; p = 0.010), any repeat revascularization (HR, 0.856; 95% CI, 0.736–0.995; p = 0.044), stroke (HR, 0.613; 95% CI, 0.417–0.901; p = 0.013), and re-hospitalization due to heart failure (HF) (HR, 0.399; 95% CI, 0.294–0.541; p &lt;0.001) in the ACEI group were significantly lower than in the ARB group. In Korean patients with AMI without a history of hypertension, the use of ACEI was significantly associated with reduced incidences of MACE, any repeat revascularization, stroke, and re-hospitalization due to HF than those with the use of ARB."
https://openalex.org/W3110601999,"Anadromous alewives ( Alosa pseudoharengus ) are abundant in the Canadian Maritimes, where they support lucrative commercial fisheries. Little is known about their coastal movement, and their potential to interact with anthropogenic structures. Acoustic telemetry can provide detailed information on the spatiotemporal distribution and survival of fishes in coastal areas, using information transmitted from tagged fishes and recorded by moored receivers. However, few acoustic telemetry studies have been performed on clupeids as they are extremely sensitive to handling, and are often compromised by surgical tag implantation. This research assesses the feasibility of a surgical tagging protocol using novel High Residency acoustic tags in alewives, and establishes a baseline of short-term tagging effects. Alewives from the Gaspereau River population were tagged between 2018 (n = 29) and 2019 (n = 96) with non-transmitting models of Vemco/Innovasea V5 HR tags. Tagging effects were evaluated based on recovery rate, reflex impairment, and necropsy-based health assessments. Alewives responded well to tagging, with low mortality (3%) and no observed instances of tag shedding 72 hours post-surgery. The use of sutures to close the incision site had no effect on recovery times. Water temperature and spawning condition had the greatest effect on the behavioural response of fish to tagging. Our findings suggest that, with proper handling and smaller acoustic tags, telemetry studies on alewives are feasible."

Reports indicate a role for chronic hemolysis and splenomegaly, however, the underlying processes are incompletely understood. New hematology analysers provide parameters for a more comprehensive analysis of RBC hemostasis. Complete blood counts were analysed in subjects from all age groups (n = 1118) living in a malaria hyperendemic area and cytokines and iron biomarkers were also measured. Subjects were divided into age groups (&lt;2 years, 2–4, 5–14 and ≥15 years old) and clinical categories (smear-negative healthy subjects, asymptomatic malaria and clinical malaria). We found that hemoglobin levels were similar in smear-negative healthy children and asymptomatic malaria children but significantly lower in clinical malaria with a maximum difference of 2.2 g/dl in children &lt;2 years decreasing to 0.1 g/dl in those aged ≥15 years. Delta-He, presenting different hemoglobinization of reticulocytes and RBC, levels were lower in asymptomatic and clinial malaria, indicating a recent effect of malaria on erythropoiesis. Reticulocyte counts and reticulocyte production index (RPI), indicating the erythropoietic capacity of the bone marrow, were higher in young children with malaria compared to smear-negative subjects. A negative correlation between reticulocyte counts and Hb levels was found in asymptomatic malaria (ρ = -0.32, p&lt;0.001) unlike in clinical malaria (ρ = -0.008, p = 0.92). Free-Hb levels, indicating hemolysis, were only higher in clinical malaria. Phagocytozing monocytes, indicating erythophagocytosis, were highest in clinical malaria, followed by asymptomatic malaria and smear-negative subjects. Circulating cytokines and iron biomarkers (hepcidin, ferritin) showed similar patterns. Pro/anti-inflammatory (IL-6/IL-10) ratio was higher in clinical than asymptomatic malaria. Cytokine production capacity of ex-vivo whole blood stimulation with LPS was lower in children with asymptomatic malaria compared to smear-negative healthy children. Bone marrow response can compensate the increased red blood cell loss in asymptomatic malaria, unlike in clinical malaria, possibly because of limited level and length of inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W3106721196,"Hopea hainanensis Merrill &amp; Chun (Dipterocarpaceae) is an endangered tree species restricted to Hainan Island, China and a small part of Northern Vietnam. On Hainan Island, it is an important indicator species for tropical forests. However, because of its highly valued timber, H . hainanensis has suffered from overexploitation, leading to a sharp population decline. To facilitate the conservation of this species, genetic diversity and population structure were assessed using 12 SSR markers for 10 populations sampled across Hainan Island. Compared to non-threatened Hopea species, H . hainanensis exhibited reduced overall genetic diversity and increased population differentiation (AMOVA: F ST = 0.23). Bayesian model-based clustering and principal coordinate analysis consistently assigned H . hainanensis individuals into three genetic groups, which were found to be widespread and overlapping geographically. A Mantel test found no correlation between genetic and geographical distances ( r = 0.040, p = 0.418). The observed genetic structure suggests that long-distance gene flow occurred among H . hainanensis populations prior to habitat fragmentation. A recent population bottleneck was revealed, which may cause rapid loss of genetic diversity and increased differentiation across populations. Based on these findings, appropriate strategies for the long-term conservation of the endangered species H . hainanensis are proposed."

We employed functional protein arrays to identify molecular changes induced in a human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC3-KT) and osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS) and evaluated their impact on outcomes associated with radiation induced genomic instability (RIGI) at day 5 and 7 post-exposure to a 2Gy X-ray dose, which revealed replication stress in the context of increased FOXM1b expression. Irradiated cells had reduced DNA replication rate detected by the DNA fiber assay and increased DNA resection detected by RPA foci and phosphorylation. Irradiated cells increased utilization of homologous recombination-dependent repair detected by a gene conversion assay and DNA damage at mitosis reflected by RPA positive chromosomal bridges, micronuclei formation and 53BP1 positive bodies in G1, all known outcomes of replication stress. Interference with the function of FOXM1, a transcription factor widely expressed in cancer, employing an aptamer, decreased radiation-induced micronuclei formation and cell transformation while plasmid-driven overexpression of FOXM1b was sufficient to induce replication stress, micronuclei formation and cell transformation."
https://openalex.org/W3108179022,"Background Socioeconomic inequality in maternity care is well-evident in many developing countries including Bangladesh, but there is a paucity of research to examine the determinants of inequality and the changes in the factors of inequality over time. This study examines the factors accounting for the levels of and changes in wealth-related inequality in three outcomes of delivery care service: health facility delivery, skilled birth attendance, and C-section delivery in Bangladesh. Methods This study uses from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey of 2011 and 2014. We apply logistic regression models to examine the association between household wealth status and delivery care measures, controlling for a wide range of sociodemographic variables. The Erreygers normalised concentration index is used to measure the level of inequalities and decomposition method is applied to disentangle the determinants contributing to the levels of and changes in the observed inequalities. Results We find a substantial inequality in delivery care service utilisation favouring woman from wealthier households. The extent of inequality increased in health facility delivery and C-section delivery in 2014 while increase in skilled birth attendance was not statistically significant. Wealth and education were the main factors explaining both the extent of and the increase in the degree of inequality between 2011 and 2014. Four or more antenatal care (ANC4+) visits accounted for about 8% to 14% of the observed inequality, but the contribution of ANC4+ visits declined in 2014. Conclusion This study reveals no progress in equity gain in the use of delivery care services in this decade compared to a declining trend in inequity in the last decade in Bangladesh. Policies need to focus on improving the provision of delivery care services among women from poorer socioeconomic groups. In addition, policy initiatives for promoting the completion of quality education are important to address the stalemate of equity gain in delivery care services in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3108254084,"Heme biosynthesis occurs through a series of reactions that take place within the cytoplasm and mitochondria, so intermediates need to move across these cellular compartments. However, the specific membrane transport mechanisms involved in the process are not yet identified. The ATP-binding cassette protein ABCB10 is essential for normal heme production, as knocking down this transporter in mice is embryonically lethal and accompanied by severe anemia plus oxidative damage. The role of ABCB10 is unknown, but given its location in the inner mitochondrial membrane, it has been proposed as a candidate to export either an early heme precursor or heme. Alternatively, ABCB10 might transport a molecule important for protection against oxidative damage. To help discern between these possibilities, we decided to study the effect of heme analogs, precursors, and antioxidant peptides on purified human ABCB10. Since substrate binding increases the ATP hydrolysis rate of ABC transporters, we have determined the ability of these molecules to activate purified ABCB10 reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs using ATPase measurements. Under our experimental conditions, we found that the only heme analog increasing ABCB10 ATPase activity was Zinc-mesoporphyrin. This activation of almost seventy percent was specific for ABCB10, as the ATPase activity of a negative control bacterial ABC transporter was not affected. The activation was also observed in cysteine-less ABCB10, suggesting that Zinc-mesoporphyrin’s effect did not require binding to typical heme regulatory motifs. Furthermore, our data indicate that ABCB10 was not directly activated by neither the early heme precursor delta-aminolevulinic acid nor glutathione, downsizing their relevance as putative substrates for this transporter. Although additional studies are needed to determine the physiological substrate of ABCB10, our findings reveal Zinc-mesoporphyrin as the first tool compound to directly modulate ABCB10 activity and raise the possibility that some actions of Zinc-mesoporphyrin in cellular and animal studies could be mediated by ABCB10."
https://openalex.org/W3109590143,"Infrequent, long-distance animal movements outside of typical home range areas provide useful insights into resource acquisition, gene flow, and disease transmission within the fields of conservation and wildlife management, yet understanding of these movements is still limited across taxa. To detect these extra-home range movements (EHRMs) in spatial relocation datasets, most previous studies compare relocation points against fixed spatial and temporal bounds, typified by seasonal home ranges (referred to here as the “Fixed-Period” method). However, utilizing home ranges modelled over fixed time periods to detect EHRMs within those periods likely results in many EHRMs going undocumented, particularly when an animal’s space use changes within that period of time. To address this, we propose a novel, “Moving-Window” method of detecting EHRMs through an iterative process, comparing each day’s relocation data to the preceding period of space use only. We compared the number and characteristics of EHRM detections by both the Moving-Window and Fixed-Period methods using GPS relocations from 33 white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) in Alabama, USA. The Moving-Window method detected 1.5 times as many EHRMs as the Fixed-Period method and identified 120 unique movements that were undetected by the Fixed-Period method, including some movements that extended nearly 5 km outside of home range boundaries. Additionally, we utilized our EHRM dataset to highlight and evaluate potential sources of variation in EHRM summary statistics stemming from differences in definition criteria among previous EHRM literature. We found that this spectrum of criteria identified between 15.6% and 100.0% of the EHRMs within our dataset. We conclude that variability in terminology and definition criteria previously used for EHRM detection hinders useful comparisons between studies. The Moving-Window approach to EHRM detection introduced here, along with proposed methodology guidelines for future EHRM studies, should allow researchers to better investigate and understand these behaviors across a variety of taxa."

Two mutations, G9R and V39R, were confirmed to increase the antifungal activity of Raphanus sativus antifungal protein 2 (RsAFP2). Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (aMD) were carried out to examine the conformational changes present in these RsAFP2 mutants, and its two closest homologs compared to the wild-type protein. Specifically, the root mean square fluctuation values for the eight cysteine amino acids involved in the four disulfide bonds were low in the V39R mutant compared to the wild-type. Additionally, analysis of the free energy change revealed that G9R and V39R mutations exert a neutral and stabilizing effect on RsAFP2 conformation, and this is supported by the observed lower total energy of mutants compared to the wild-type, suggesting that enhanced stability of the mutants. However, MD simulations to a longer time scale would aid in capturing more conformational state of the wild-type and mutants defensin protein. Furthermore, the aMD simulations on fungal mimic membranes with RsAFP2 and its mutants and homologs showed that the mutant proteins caused higher deformation and water diffusion than the native RsAFP2, especially the V39R mutant. The mutant variants seem to interact by specifically targeting the POPC and POPI lipids amongst others. This work highlights the stabilizing effect of mutations at the 9 th and 39 th positions of RsAFP2 and their increased membrane deformation activity."

In its native range it is known to use man-made cavities to construct nests. A series of serious safety incidents Brisbane Airport related to the obstruction of vital airspeed measuring pitot probes on aircraft possibly caused by mud-nesting wasps, prompted an assessment of risk. An experiment was designed to determine the species responsible, the types of aircraft most affected, the seasonal pattern of potential risk and the spatial distribution of risk on the airport. A series of replica pitot probes were constructed using 3D-printing technology, representing aircraft with high numbers of movements (landings and take-offs), and mounted at four locations at the airport. Probes were monitored for 39 months. Probes blocked by mud nesting wasps were retrieved and incubated in mesh bags. Emerging wasps were identified to species. Results show that all nests in probes were made by P . nasidens , and peak nesting occurs in the summer months. Nesting success (as proportion of nests with live adult emergents) was optimal between 24 and 31°C and that probes with apertures of more than 3 mm diameter are preferred. Not all areas on the airport are affected equally, with the majority of nests constructed in one area. The proportion of grassed areas within 1000 m of probes was a significant predictor of nesting, and probe volume may determine the sex of emerging wasps."
https://openalex.org/W3109541955,"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is intractable and severely affects a patient’s quality of life. Although many cases of MRONJ have been reported in the past decade, the disease pathophysiology is unclear and there are no evidence-based therapeutic strategies. MRONJ usually features bone inflammation and infection. Prior studies that explored the association between MRONJ and microbial infection used the culture-based approach, which is not applicable to hundreds of unculturable taxa in the human oral microbiome, or 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, which does not provide quantitative information of the abundance of specific taxa, and information of the presence, abundance, and function of specific genes in the microbiome. Here, deep shotgun metagenome sequencing (&gt;10 Gb per sample) of bulk DNA extracted from saliva of MRONJ patients and healthy controls was performed to overcome these limitations. Comparative quantitative analyses of taxonomic and functional composition of these deep metagenomes (initially of 5 patients and 5 healthy controls) revealed an average 10.1% increase of genus Actinomyces and a 33.2% decrease in genus Streptococcus normally predominant in the human oral microbiota. Pan-genome analysis identified genes present exclusively in the MRONJ samples. Further analysis of the reads mapping to the genes in the extended dataset comprising five additional MRONJ samples and publicly available dataset of nine healthy controls resulted in the identification of 31 genes significantly associated with MRONJ. All these genes were encoded by Actinomyces genomic regions. Of these, the top two abundant genes were almost exclusively encoded by Actinomyces among usual taxa in the human oral microbiota. The potential relationships of these key genes with the disease are discussed at molecular level based on the literature. Although the sample size was small, this study will aid future studies to verify the data and characterize these genes in vitro and in vivo to understand the disease mechanisms, develop molecular targeted drugs, and for early stage screening and prognosis prediction."
https://openalex.org/W3110422350,"We previously reported that at term pregnancy, a decline in myometrial protein kinase A (PKA) activity leads to an exchange protein activated by cyclic AMP (Epac1)-dependent increase in oxytocin receptor (OTR) expression, promoting the onset of labour. Here, we studied the changes in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) effector system present in different phenotypes of preterm labour (PTL). Myometrial biopsies obtained from women with phenotypically distinct forms of PTL and the levels of PKA and OTR were examined. Although we found similar changes in the cAMP effector pathway in all forms of PTL, only in the case of twin PTL (T-PTL) was myometrial OTR levels increased in association with these results. Although there were several changes in the mRNA levels of components of the cAMP synthetic pathway, the total myometrial cAMP levels did not change with the onset of any subtype of PTL. With regards to the expression of cAMP-responsive genes, we found that the mRNA levels of 4 of the 5 cAMP-down-regulated genes were increased in T-PTL, similar to our findings in term labour. These data signify that although changes in the cAMP effector system were common to all forms of PTL, only in T-PTL were OTR levels increased. Similarly, the mRNA levels of cAMP-repressed genes were only increased in T-PTL supporting the concept that the decline in PKA levels influences myometrial function driving the onset of T-PTL."
https://openalex.org/W3109696928,"Pre-mRNA splicing is critical for achieving required amounts of a transcript at a given time and for regulating production of encoded protein. A given pre-mRNA may be spliced in many ways, or not at all, giving rise to multiple gene products. Numerous splicing factors are recruited to pre-mRNA splice sites to ensure proper splicing. One such factor, the 60 kDa poly(U)-binding splicing factor (PUF60), is recruited to sites that are not always spliced, but rather function as alternative splice sites. In this study, we characterized the interaction of PUF60 with a splice site from the adenovirus major late promoter (the AdML 3' splice site, AdML 3’). We found that the PUF60– AdML 3’ dissociation constants are in the micromolar range, with the binding affinity predominantly provided by PUF60’s two central RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). A 1.95 Å crystal structure of the two PUF60 RRMs in complex with AdML 3’ revealed a dimeric organization placing two stretches of nucleic acid tracts in opposing directionalities, which can cause looping of nucleic acid and explain how PUF60 affects pre-mRNA geometry to effect splicing. Solution characterization of this complex by light-scattering and UV/Vis spectroscopy suggested a potential 2:1 (PUF60 2 : AdML 3’) stoichiometry, consistent with the crystal structure. This work defines the sequence specificity of the alternative splicing factor PUF60 at the pre-mRNA 3’ splice site. Our observations suggest that control of pre-mRNA directionality is important in the early stage of spliceosome assembly, and advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which alternative and constitutive splicing factors differentiate among 3’ splice sites."

However, the factors accelerating this poor QOL have not been fully examined in Nepal. Therefore, this study examined the factors associated with the QOL of older adults residing in the rural setting of Nepal. Methods Data from a previous cross-sectional study conducted among older adults between January and April 2018 in in rural Nepal was used in this study. The analytical sample included 794 older adults aged ≥60 years, selected by a multi-stage cluster sampling approach. QOL was measured using the Older People’s Quality of Life tool; dichotomized as poor and good QOL. Other measures used included age, gender, ethnicity, religion, marital status, physical activity, and chronic diseases such as osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and depression. The factors associated with QOL were examined using mixed-effects logistic regression. Results Seven in ten respondents (70.4%) reported a poor QOL. At the bivariate level, increasing age, unemployment, intake of alcohol, lack of physical activity as well as osteoarthritis, COPD and depression were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of a good QOL. The adjusted model showed that older age (AOR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28–0.90), the Christian religion (AOR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.20–0.70), and of an Indigenous (AOR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.14–0.47), Dalit (AOR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.10–0.56), and Madheshi (AOR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.14–0.60) ethnic background were associated with lower odds of good QOL. However, higher income of &gt;NRs 10,000 (AOR = 3.34, 95% CI: 1.43–3.99), daily physical activity (AOR: 3.33; 95% CI: 2.55–4.34), and the absence of osteoarthritis (AOR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.09–3.49) and depression (AOR: 3.34; 95% CI: 2.14–5.22) were associated with higher odds of good QOL. Conclusion The findings of this study reinforce the need of improving QOL of older adults through implementing programs aimed at addressing the identified biosocial and disease conditions that catalyse poor QOL in this older population residing in rural parts of Nepal."
https://openalex.org/W3110320133,"Three AKT serine/threonine kinase isoforms (AKT1/AKT2/AKT3) mediate proliferation, metabolism, differentiation and anti-apoptotic signals. AKT isoforms are activated downstream of PI3-kinase and also by PI3-kinase independent mechanisms. Mutations in the lipid phosphatase PTEN and PI3-kinase that increase PIP3 levels increase AKT signaling in a large proportion of human cancers. AKT and other AGC kinases possess a regulatory mechanism that relies on a conserved hydrophobic motif (HM) C-terminal to the catalytic core. In AKT, the HM is contiguous to the serine 473 and two other newly discovered (serine 477 and tyrosine 479) regulatory phosphorylation sites. In AKT genes, this regulatory HM region is encoded in the final exon. We identified a splice variant of AKT2 (AKT2-13a), which contains an alternative final exon and lacks the HM regulatory site. We validated the presence of mRNA for this AKT2-13a splice variant in different tissues, and the presence of AKT2-13a protein in extracts from HEK293 cells. When overexpressed in HEK293 cells, AKT2-13a is phosphorylated at the activation loop and at the zipper/turn motif phosphorylation sites but has reduced specific activity. Analysis of the human transcriptome corresponding to other AGC kinases revealed that all three AKT isoforms express alternative transcripts lacking the HM regulatory motif, which was not the case for SGK1-3, S6K1-2, and classical, novel and atypical PKC isoforms. The transcripts of splice variants of Akt1-3 excluding the HM regulatory region could lead to expression of deregulated forms of AKT."
https://openalex.org/W3106617480,"The road network is the skeletal element of topographic maps at different scales. In general, urban roads are connected by road segments, thus forming a series of road meshes. Mesh elimination is a key step in evaluating the importance of roads during the road network data management and a prerequisite to the implementation of continuous multiscale spatial representation of road networks. The existing mesh-based method is an advanced road elimination method whereby meshes with the largest density are sequentially selected and road segments with the least importance in each mesh are eliminated. However, the road connectivity and integrity may be destroyed in specific areas by this method because some eliminated road segments could be located in the middle of road strokes. Therefore, this paper proposed an elimination method for isolated meshes in a road network considering stroke edge feature. First, small meshes were identified by using mesh density thresholds, which can be obtained by the sample data statistical algorithm. Thereafter, the small meshes related to the edge segments of road strokes were taken out and defined as stroke edge meshes, and the remaining small meshes were defined as stroke non-edge meshes. Second, by computing the mesh density of all stroke edge meshes, the mesh with the largest density was selected as the starting mesh, and the least important edge segment in the mesh was eliminated. The difference between the existing mesh-based method and the proposed method is that the starting mesh is a stroke edge mesh, not any given small mesh, and the eliminated segment is just only one of edge segments of strokes not chosen from among all segments. Third, mesh elimination was implemented by iteratively processing the stroke edge meshes with the largest mesh density until all of them were eliminated and their mesh density exceeded the threshold. The stroke non-edge meshes were directly preserved. Finally, a 1:10,000 topographic road map of an area in Jiangsu Province of China was used for validation. The experimental results show that for all stroke non-edge meshes and 23% of the stroke edge meshes, compared to the mesh-based method, the road stroke connectivity and integrity of road strokes were better preserved by the proposed method, and the remaining 77% of the elimination results for the stroke edge meshes were the same under the two methods."
https://openalex.org/W3109745025,"Background The underlying aetiology of ischaemic strokes is unknown in as many as 50% of cases. Patent foramen ovale (PFO) has become an increasingly recognised cause of ischaemic strokes in young patients. The present study aimed (1) to assess the frequency of transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) performed and the proportion of PFOs detected in patients aged ≤60 years and (2) examine the effect of PFO closure on reducing stroke reoccurrence. Methods This was a retrospective clinical audit based on de-identified, secure medical records of the Canberra Hospital, Australia. A review of records was conducted on discharged patients aged 18–60 years admitted to the stroke unit following an ischaemic stroke episode between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018. Results A total of 214 acute ischaemic stroke patients were admitted to the stroke unit (mean age, 49.2 ± 9.7 years). Concerning aetiology, 47.2% were cryptogenic in origin, whereas 52.8% had a stroke of a determined cause. 12 patients were diagnosed with a PFO and 7 venous thromboembolic events were identified, 1 in the cryptogenic group and 6 in the determined cause group. 91.7% of PFOs were diagnosed in patients with a cryptogenic stroke. Trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed in 37.3% of patients and had detected 4 PFOs (sensitivity 27.3%, specificity 92.5%). TOE was performed in 26.2% of patients and had detected 11 PFOs (sensitivity 90.0%, specificity 100%). The number needed to treat to prevent the occurrence of an ischaemic stroke through PFO closure was estimated at 30. Conclusions An inverse association between age and PFO presence was found in patients aged 18–60 years. Additionally, TOE was superior to TTE for detecting PFO, particularly in those with stroke of an undetermined cause. Our results suggest an increased need for TOE as a routine imaging procedure for acute ischaemic stroke patients aged ≤60."
https://openalex.org/W3109814361,"RNA aptamers are relatively short nucleic acid sequences that bind targets with high affinity, and when combined with a riboswitch that initiates translation of a fluorescent reporter protein, can be used as a biosensor for chemical detection in various types of media. These processes span target binding at the molecular scale to fluorescence detection at the macroscale, which involves a number of intermediate rate-limiting physical (e.g., molecular conformation change) and biochemical changes (e.g., reaction velocity), which together complicate assay design. Here we describe a mathematical model developed to aid environmental detection of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) using the DsRed fluorescent reporter protein, but is general enough to potentially predict fluorescence from a broad range of water-soluble chemicals given the values of just a few kinetic rate constants as input. If we expose a riboswitch test population of Escherichia coli bacteria to a chemical dissolved in media, then the model predicts an empirically distinct, power-law relationship between the exposure concentration and the elapsed time of exposure. This relationship can be used to deduce an exposure time that meets or exceeds the optical threshold of a fluorescence detection device and inform new biosensor designs."
https://openalex.org/W3109853605,"Since Marine sponge Dysidea avara is regarded as a source of anti-inflammatory compounds, we decided to evaluate its potential anti-psoriatic activity in a psoriasis Imiquimod-induced in the mouse model. Psoriatic mice were treated with three different methanolic extracts of Dysidea avara compared with betamethasone-treated mice in in- vivo studies. Clinical skin severity was assessed with the psoriasis area index (PASI), whilst ELISA detected the expression of TNF-α, IL-17A, and IL-22. Dysidea avara activity was studied by employing GC-MS (to distinguish compounds), HPTLC (for skin permeation and accumulation), and SEA DOCK to predict single compound potential anti-inflammatory activity. After 7 days of treatment, mice treated with Dysidea avara displayed a dose-dependent, statistically significant improvement compared to controls ( p &lt; 0.001). In line with the clinical results, ELISA revealed a statistically significant decrease in IL-22, IL-17A, and TNF-α after treatment; the same SEA DOCK analysis suggests a possible anti-psoriatic activity of the extracts."
https://openalex.org/W3110132358,"An opaque fetal membrane based on gross appearance is traditionally indicative of histological chorioamnionitis; however, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no supportive evidence, and its diagnostic efficiency has not yet been scientifically demonstrated. The present study aimed to provide scientific insights into the traditional concept of an opaque fetal membrane based on gross appearance being an indicator of histological chorioamnionitis. We examined the placental pathology after screening of the placental gross appearance and perinatal complications and did not examine uncomplicated deliveries. We investigated the relationship between the presence of an opaque fetal membrane and histological chorioamnionitis (Cohort 1, 571 placentas) or the outcomes of neonates delivered at term (Cohort 2, 409 placentas) at Hamamatsu University School of Medicine between 2010 and 2017. The judgment of a positive opaque fetal membrane based on gross appearance correlated with histological chorioamnionitis (Cohort 1). Its sensitivity and specificity were 66.7 and 89.9%, respectively, while positive and negative predictive values were 86.8 and 73.0%, respectively. The judgment of a positive opaque fetal membrane based on gross appearance significantly correlated with chorioamnionitis-related complications in term newborns after adjustments for confounding factors (OR;1.82 [1.07–3.11], P&lt;0.05) (Cohort 2). A correlation was observed even after adjustments for confounding factors. The present study is the first to demonstrate that the judgment of a positive opaque fetal membrane based on gross appearance correlated with histological chorioamnionitis as well as chorioamnionitis-related complications in newborns delivered at term. The present results provide support for the traditionally-described importance of gross inspections for an opaque fetal membrane soon after birth."
https://openalex.org/W3110154270,"Background The relationship between several intriguing perinatal phenomena, namely, modal, optimal, and relative birthweight and gestational age, remains poorly understood, especially the mechanism by which relative birthweight and gestational age resolve the paradox of intersecting perinatal mortality curves. Methods Birthweight and gestational age distributions and birthweight- and gestational age-specific perinatal death rates of low- and high-risk cohorts in the United States, 2004–2015, were estimated using births-based and extended fetuses-at-risk formulations. The relationships between these births-based distributions and rates, and the first derivatives of fetuses-at-risk birth and perinatal death rates were examined in order to assess how the rate of change in fetuses-at-risk rates affects gestational age distributions and births-based perinatal death rate patterns. Results Modal gestational age typically exceeded optimal gestational age because both were influenced by the peak in the first derivative of the birth rate, while optimal gestational age was additionally influenced by the point at which the first derivative of the fetuses-at-risk perinatal death rate showed a sharp increase in late gestation. The clustering and correlation between modal and optimal gestational age within cohorts, the higher perinatal death rate at optimal gestational age among higher-risk cohorts, and the symmetric left-shift in births-based gestational age-specific perinatal death rates in higher-risk cohorts explained how relative gestational age resolved the paradox of intersecting perinatal mortality curves. Conclusions Changes in the first derivative of the fetuses-at-risk birth and perinatal death rates underlie several births-based perinatal phenomena and this explanation further unifies the fetuses-at-risk and births-based models of perinatal death."
https://openalex.org/W3110529958,"The pathway from the medial habenular nucleus to the interpeduncular nucleus, in which nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) including the α3 and α5 subunits (α3 * and α5 * nAChRs) are expressed, is implicated in nicotine dependence. We investigated whether α3 * and α5 * nAChRs are regulated by cAMP using SH-SY5Y cells to clarify the significance of these receptors in nicotine dependence. We analyzed the nicotine-induced elevation of intracellular Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ]i). Nicotine induces a concentration-dependent increase in [Ca 2+ ]i. The elimination of Ca 2+ from extracellular fluid or intracellular stores demonstrated that the nicotine-induced [Ca 2+ ]i elevation was due to extracellular influx and intracellular mobilization. The effects of tubocurarine on nicotine-induced [Ca 2+ ]i elevation and current suggest that intracellular mobilization is caused by plasma membrane-permeating nicotine. The inhibition of α3 *, α5 *, α7 nAChR and voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels by using siRNAs and selective antagonists revealed the involvement of these nAChR subunits and channels in nicotine-induced [Ca 2+ ]i elevation. To distinguish and characterize the α3 * and α5 * nAChR-mediated Ca 2+ influx, we measured the [Ca 2+ ]i elevation induced by nonmembrane-permeating acetylcholine when muscarinic receptors, α7nAChR and Ca 2+ channels were blocked. Under this condition, the [Ca 2+ ]i elevation was significantly inhibited with a 48-h treatment of dibutyryl cAMP, which was accompanied by the downregulation of α3 and β4 mRNA. These findings suggest that α3 * and α5 * nAChR-mediated Ca 2+ influx is possibly regulated by cAMP at the transcriptional level."
