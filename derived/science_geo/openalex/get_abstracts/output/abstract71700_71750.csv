https://openalex.org/W2012708621,"Measurements of serum freezing points in three Antarctic marine fishes indicated that they do not freeze in the -1.87°C seawater because their blood is isosmotic to seawater. Concentrations of sodium chloride, urea, and free amino acids in the serum accounted for only half of the freezing-point depression of the serum. A protein containing carbohydrate was isolated which accounted for 30 percent of the freezing-point depression of the serum."

In appropriate doses it causes burning sensations, facial pressure, and chest pain. These are pharmacological effects obeying a dose-effect relationship. There is considerable variation in oral threshold doses among individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1975989837,"Lymph node lymphocytes obtained from guinea pigs exhibiting delayed hypersensitivity are stimulated in vitro by specific antigen to produce a soluble factor that is chemotactic in vitro for mononuclear macrophages. The material is nondialyzable, relatively heat stable, and elutes from Sephadex G-100 in the fraction containing molecules smaller than immunoglobulins."

Dry weights and wet weights were compared and both yielded identical percentage differences between brains of animals experiencing enrichment and those experiencing impoverishment."
https://openalex.org/W2082260793,"The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase contents of oocytes from XO and XX female mice have been measured. The activity of the former in the oocytes of XO mice is half of that in the oocytes of XX mice, whereas the lactate dehydrogenase activities in the two groups of ova are the same. These results indicate that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from a mouse oocyte is an X-linked enzyme, that its synthesis occurs in the oocyte and is dosage dependent, and that inactivation of the X chromosome does not occur in the mouse oocyte."

https://openalex.org/W2063295091,"Plasma from 54 patients with hemophilia A was tested for neutralizing activity with a human antibody to factor VIII. The plasma from 52 patients had no demonstrable neutralizing activity. Two plasma samples had neutralizing activity equivalent to that of normal plasma despite the lack of factor VIII clotting activity. Apparently, most patients with hemophilia A do not synthesize factor VIII, whereas a few synthesize an inactive molecule with a presumed genetic structural mutation of the active site but with antigenic determinants in common with normal factor VIII. Thus, hemophilia A is a disease caused by more than a single genetic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2123462513,Lymphocytes have anatomic and functional characteristics reminiscent of the amoeba. The capacity to form microspikes on the uropod suggests a high degree of specialization essential to the lymphocyte's function in immunologic reactions.
https://openalex.org/W2028890311,"The cationic, antibacterial proteins of polymorphonuclear leukocytes are associated with a unique subcellular particle that is separable through zonal density gradient centrifugation from acid phosphatase-containing particles as well as from particles that contain alkaline phosphatase and lysozyme. Normal macrophages, macrophages stimulated by bacillus Calmette-Guérin, and liver cells lack this particle and the associated group of cationic proteins. Particles physically and biochemically similar to slower sedimenting enzyme-rich particles of polymorphonuclear leukocytes are shared by all the tlhree cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2000660240,Respiratory and pumping rates in the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria were measured directly in running seawater; the quantity of oxygen used was calculated from the difference in concentrations in incurrent and excurrent water. A linear relationship between pumping and respiratory rates suggests regulation of water transport by oxygen requirement rather than by feeding.

https://openalex.org/W1977805518,Postpartum female rats deprived of suckling stimulation while being kept continuously with pups nonetheless suspended ovarian cyclicity for an average of 16 days and responded to uterine trauma by forming deciduomata. These results show that the extramammary stimulation afforded by young is alone capable of sustaining prolactin output from the adenohypophysis of the postpartum rat.

https://openalex.org/W2008286550,"Mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) were reared aseptically for one generation on an artificial diet containing neither vitamin A nor its usual precursor in animals, betacarotene. Function (electrical response to light) in the compound eyes of these animals was severely impaired. Ultrastructure of the photoreceptor cells was abnormal in two respects: multivesicular bodies were absent, and masses of smooth membrane lamellae were present near the nucleus. The organization of the photoreceptor organelle, the rhabdomere, was normal. The eyes of control mosquitoes, to whose diet beta-carotene was added, were functionally and structurally normal. Multivesicular bodies were normally abundant and the perinuclear membrane masses were not present."

https://openalex.org/W2091487329,"Aerial sprays of synthetic auxins defoliate many species of tropical trees. Treatment of Euonymus japonica leaves with the n-butyl ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid causes premature senescence and leaf fall and stimulates ethylene production by the blade 5- to 25-fold. Exposure to ethylene alone similarly accelerates senescence and leaf fall. Evidence indicates that the defoliant action of auxin is mediated through the enhanced amounts of ethylene in the blade."

https://openalex.org/W2019034585,Rats easily discriminate between two types of subcortical brain shock which differ in reinforcing properties. When both stimuli are either neutral or positively reinforcing subjects have difficulty in responding differentially to the two types of electrical stimulation of the brain. Possible implications for a theory concerning a generalized or diffuse reinforcement system are discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2044461283,"Hemicholinium-3, when applied to the inside of a squid axon, is effective in blocking the action potential. This action is not antagonized by the addition of choline or acetylcholine to the perfusate. Voltage-clamp experiments show that hemicholinium-3 depresses both the early transient and late steady-state components of membrane ionic conductances, with a greater effect on the peak transient component."

The nuclear radius, irregularity, area, and density of normal and malignant cells were automatically measured. These studies agreed with hand measurements showed differences normal and malignant cervical cells on Papanicolaou smears."
https://openalex.org/W2108888996,"Maximum catalytic capacity for renal trehalase varied from 20 micromoles (of glucose produced per minute per gram of fresh tissue) for the armadillo down to zero for the rat, the cat, most turtles, fishes, and all birds and snakes investigated. Labeled trehalose could not be demonstrated in the kidney of the rabbit and the rat after injection with labeled glucose. These data do not support the hypothesis that trehalase and trehalose function in the transport of glucose through the kidney."

https://openalex.org/W2054951176,"IF a person is asked to make a judgment of the distance between him and some object which he is viewing, and if he has no cues on which to base such a judgment, it seems plausible to suppose that he could make the judgment if he knew how large the stimulus actually was. Whether or not subjects can take size information into account when making visual judgments of absolute distance in completely reduced conditions has been the subject of some controversy1–5. Recent results6 have suggested, however, that this does happen, whether size information is contributed by past experience with the visual stimulus, by means of a haptic comparison–object, or verbally."
