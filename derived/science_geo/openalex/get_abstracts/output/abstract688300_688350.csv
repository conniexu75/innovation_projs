https://openalex.org/W4210791148,"Pregnant women are at increased risk for COVID-19, and COVID-19 vaccine is the most promising solution to overcome the current pandemic. This study was conducted to evaluate pregnant women's perceptions and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination.A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 18 to April 5 2021. An anonymous survey was distributed in 7 French obstetrics departments to all pregnant women before a prenatal visit. All pregnant women attending a follow-up consultation were asked to participate in the study. An anonymous web survey was available through a QR code and participants were asked whether or not they would agree to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, and why. The questionnaire included questions on the patients' demographics and their knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines.Of the 664 pregnant women who completed the questionnaire, 29.5% (95% CI 27.7; 31.3) indicated they would agree to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The main reason for not agreeing was being more afraid of potential side effects of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on the fetus than of COVID-19. Factors influencing acceptance of vaccination were: being slightly older, multiparity, having discussed it with a caregiver and acceptance of the influenza vaccine.Nearly one-third of pregnant women in this population would be willing to be vaccinated. In addition to studies establishing fetal safety, public health agencies and healthcare professionals should provide accurate information about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines."

Maternal preparatory nesting is an essential behavior for the survival of the upcoming litter. Brain-wide immediate early gene mapping in mice evoked by nesting sequences revealed that phases of nest construction strongly activate peptidergic neurons of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus in pregnant mice. Genetic ablation, bidirectional neuromodulation, and in vitro and in vivo activity recordings demonstrated that these neurons are essential to modulate arousal before sleep to promote nesting specifically. We show that these neurons enable the behavioral effects of progesterone on preparatory nesting by modulating a broad network of downstream targets. Our study deciphers the role of midbrain CART+ neurons in behavioral adaptations during pregnancy vital for reproductive fitness."
https://openalex.org/W4210703622,"The need for resilient health systems is recognized as important for the attainment of health outcomes, given the current shocks to health services. Resilience has been defined as the capacity to “prepare and effectively respond to crises; maintain core functions; and, informed by lessons learnt, reorganize if conditions require it”. There is however a recognized dichotomy between its conceptualization in literature, and its application in practice. We propose two mutually reinforcing categories of resilience, representing resilience targeted at potentially known shocks, and the inherent health system resilience, needed to respond to unpredictable shock events. We determined capacities for each of these categories, and explored this methodological proposition by computing country-specific scores against each capacity, for the 47 Member States of the WHO African Region. We assessed face validity of the computed index, to ensure derived values were representative of the different elements of resilience, and were predictive of health outcomes, and computed bias-corrected non-parametric confidence intervals of the emergency preparedness and response (EPR) and inherent system resilience (ISR) sub-indices, as well as the overall resilience index, using 1000 bootstrap replicates. We also explored the internal consistency and scale reliability of the index, by calculating Cronbach alphas for the various proposed capacities and their corresponding attributes. We computed overall resilience to be 48.4 out of a possible 100 in the 47 assessed countries, with generally lower levels of ISR. For ISR, the capacities were weakest for transformation capacity, followed by mobilization of resources, awareness of own capacities, self-regulation and finally diversity of services respectively. This paper aims to contribute to the growing body of empirical evidence on health systems and service resilience, which is of great importance to the functionality and performance of health systems, particularly in the context of COVID-19. It provides a methodological reflection for monitoring health system resilience, revealing areas of improvement in the provision of essential health services during shock events, and builds a case for the need for mechanisms, at country level, that address both specific and non-specific shocks to the health system, ultimately for the attainment of improved health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4220666543,"The non-classical function of acetylcholine (ACh) has been reported in neuroinflammation that represents the modulating factor in immune responses via activation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR), i.e., a cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme for ACh hydrolysis, has been proposed to have a non-classical function in immune cells. However, the involvement of AChE in neuroinflammation is unclear. Here, cultured BV2 cell, a microglial cell line, and primary microglia from rats were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce inflammation and to explore the regulation of AChE during this process. The expression profiles of AChE, α7 nAChR, and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were revealed in BV2 cells. The expression of AChE (G4 form) was induced significantly in LPS-treated BV2 cells: the induction was triggered by NF-κB and cAMP signaling. Moreover, ACh or α7 nAChR agonist suppressed the LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the phagocytosis of microglia, by activating α7 nAChR and followed by the regulation of NF-κB and CREB signaling. The ACh-induced suppression of inflammation was abolished in AChE overexpressed cells, but did not show a significant change in AChE mutant (enzymatic activity knockout) transfected cells. These results indicate that the neuroinflammation-regulated function of AChE may be mediated by controlling the ACh level in the brain system."
https://openalex.org/W4210261475,"Endometriosis is a common benign disease in women of reproductive age. Qu's formula (QUF) is a patented Chinese herbal medicine for treating endometriosis that has been proven to be effective in treating and preventing the recurrence of endometriosis. This study is aimed to discover its molecular mechanism and to explore the potential drug targets.A QUF target and endometriosis-related gene set was identified by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) and Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular Mechanism of Traditional Chinese Medicine (BATMAN-TCM) databases and five disease-gene databases. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established to discover the potential mechanism. MalaCards was searched for targets and signaling pathways related to endometriosis, and the search results were also used to identify the key factors in QUF. Molecular docking was performed to visualize the interactions between the effective molecules and proteins encoded by critical genes. Cell experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to further validate the therapeutic effects of the active compounds in QUF on endometriosis.A compound-target network with 117 nodes (94 genes and 23 active compounds) and 224 edges was generated. The results of GO and KEGG analyses indicated that QUF could act by regulating the immune response, apoptosis and proliferation, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis. VEGFA, CXCL8, CCL2, IL1B and PTGS2 were selected for molecular docking analysis from two critical subnetworks with high correlation scores in MalaCards, and the active compounds of QUF had binding potential and high affinity for them. The mRNA expression levels of CCL2, IL1B and PTGS2 significantly decreased after treatment with quercetin. MD simulations showed that the combinations of quercetin and these proteins were relatively stable.The network pharmacological strategy integrates molecular docking to unravel the molecular mechanism by which QUF protects against endometriosis. Our findings not only confirm the clinical effectiveness of QUF but also provide a foundation for further experimental study."
https://openalex.org/W4210280182,"Abstract EGLN3 is critically important for growth of various cancers including lung cancer. However, virtually nothing is known about the role and mechanism for EGLN3 hydroxylase activity in cancers. EGLN3 catalyzes the hydroxylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (Erk3), a potent driver of cancers. The role and mechanism for EGLN3-induced stabilization of Erk3 remain to be defined. Here, we show that Erk3 interacts with heat shock cognate protein of 70 kDa (HSC70) and lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2 A (LAMP2A), two core components of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). As a consequence, Erk3 is degraded by the CMA-lysosome pathway. EGLN3-catalyzed hydroxylation antagonizes CMA-dependent destruction of Erk3. Mechanistically, hydroxylation blunts the interaction of Erk3 with LAMP2A, thereby blocking lysosomal decay of Erk3. EGLN3 inactivation inhibits macrophage migration, efferocytosis, and M2 polarization. Studies using EGLN3 catalytically inactive knock-in mice indicate that inactivation of EGLN3 hydroxylase in host cells ameliorates LLC cancer growth through reprogramming the tumor microenvironment (TME). Adoptive transfer of macrophages with inactivated EGLN3 restrains tumor growth by mounting anti-tumor immunity and restricting angiogenesis. Administration of EGLN3 hydroxylase pharmacologic inhibitor to mice bearing LLC carcinoma impedes cancer growth by targeting the TME. LLC cells harboring inactivated EGLN3 exhibit reduced tumor burden via mitigating immunosuppressive milieu and inducing cancer senescence. This study provides novel insights into the role of CMA in regulating Erk3 stability and the mechanism behind EGLN3-enhanced stability of Erk3. This work demonstrates that inactivation of EGLN3 in malignant and stromal cells suppresses tumor by orchestrating reciprocal interplays between cancer cells and the TME. This work sheds new light on the role and mechanism for EGLN3 catalytic activity in regulating cancer growth. Manipulating EGLN3 activity holds promise for cancer treatment."

https://openalex.org/W4210344467,"Objective Juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is a complex and heterogeneous immune-mediated disease. Cellular components have crucial roles in disease phenotypes and outcomes. We aimed to determine the associations of lymphocyte subsets with clinical manifestations and long-term outcomes in JSLE patients. Methods A cohort of 60 JSLE patients provided blood samples during active disease, of whom 34 provided further samples during inactive disease. In a longitudinal study, blood samples were obtained from 49 of the JSLE patients at 0, 3, and 6 months. The healthy control (HC) group consisted of 42 age-matched children. Lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results The percentages of CD4 + T, γδ T, and NK cells were significantly decreased in JSLE patients compared with HC, while the percentages of CD8 + T, NKT, and CD19 + B cells were significantly increased. The percentage of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was significantly lower in JSLE patients with lupus nephritis (LN) than in non-LN JSLE patients and HC. The patients were stratified into high and low groups by the median frequency of each lymphocyte subset. The γδ T cells high group and NK cells high group were significantly related to mucosal ulcer. The CD4 + T cells high group was significantly associated with arthritis, and the NKT cells high group was substantially linked with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The CD8 + T cells low group was mainly related to vasculitis, and the Tregs low group was significantly associated with LN. The percentage of Tregs was significantly increased at 6 months of follow-up, and the LN JSLE group had a lower Treg percentage than the non-LN JSLE group. Predictors of remission on therapy were high Tregs, high absolute lymphocyte count, direct Coombs test positivity, and LN absence at enrollment. Conclusion JSLE patients exhibited altered lymphocyte subsets, which were strongly associated with clinical phenotypes and long-term outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4210400614,"Diabetes normally causes lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in the kidneys, which plays a critical role in the onset of diabetic nephropathy; however, the mechanism by which dysregulated fatty acid metabolism increases lipid and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in the diabetic kidney is not clear. As succinate is remarkably increased in the diabetic kidney, and accumulation of succinate suppresses mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and increases ROS formation, we hypothesized that succinate might play a role in inducing lipid and ROS accumulation in the diabetic kidney. Here we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which diabetes induces lipid and ROS accumulation in the kidney of diabetic animals. We show that enhanced oxidation of dicarboxylic acids by peroxisomes leads to lipid and ROS accumulation in the kidney of diabetic mice via the metabolite succinate. Furthermore, specific suppression of peroxisomal β-oxidation improved diabetes-induced nephropathy by reducing succinate generation and attenuating lipid and ROS accumulation in the kidneys of the diabetic mice. We suggest that peroxisome-generated succinate acts as a pathological molecule inducing lipid and ROS accumulation in kidney, and that specifically targeting peroxisomal β-oxidation might be an effective strategy in treating diabetic nephropathy and related metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4210431358,"Research into the metabolism of the non-essential amino acid (NEAA) proline in cancer has gained traction in recent years. The last step in the proline biosynthesis pathway is catalyzed by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (PYCR) enzymes. There are three PYCR enzymes: mitochondrial PYCR1 and 2 and cytosolic PYCR3 encoded by separate genes. The expression of the PYCR1 gene is increased in numerous malignancies and correlates with poor prognosis. PYCR1 expression sustains cancer cells' proliferation and survival and several mechanisms have been implicated to explain its oncogenic role. It has been suggested that the biosynthesis of proline is key to sustain protein synthesis, support mitochondrial function and nucleotide biosynthesis. However, the links between proline metabolism and cancer remain ill-defined and are likely to be tissue specific. Here we use a combination of human dataset, human tissue and mouse models to show that the expression levels of the proline biosynthesis enzymes are significantly increased during colorectal tumorigenesis. Functionally, the expression of mitochondrial PYCRs is necessary for cancer cells' survival and proliferation. However, the phenotypic consequences of PYCRs depletion could not be rescued by external supplementation with either proline or nucleotides. Overall, our data suggest that, despite the mechanisms underlying the role of proline metabolism in colorectal tumorigenesis remain elusive, targeting the proline biosynthesis pathway is a suitable approach for the development of novel anti-cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4220948481,"Obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with the development of insulin resistance. Among several metabolites, resolvins that are metabolites of eicosapentaenoic acid have been shown to exert insulin-sensitizing effects; however, the role of resolvin E3 (RvE3) in glucose metabolism has not been studied. In this study, the effect of RvE3 on glucose metabolism in mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity and 3T3L1 adipocytes was studied. C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet were administered RvE3, for which insulin tolerance, oral glucose tolerance tests, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, were performed. RvE3 treatment significantly improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and regulated protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation in the adipose tissue. Moreover, RvE3 treatment enhanced the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) translocation, glucose uptake, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) activity, and Akt phosphorylation in 3T3L1 adipocytes, whereas a PI3K inhibitor inhibited the enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake induced by RvE3. These findings indicate that RvE3 likely improves insulin sensitivity, resulting in the upregulation of glucose uptake in adipocytes by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Collectively, the findings of this study show that RvE3 may play a role in glucose homeostasis and could be used as a potential therapeutic target for developing treatments for obesity-associated diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4226076365,"The rapid emergence of virulent and multidrug-resistant (MDR) non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) enterica serovars is a growing public health concern globally. The present study focused on the assessment of the pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling of NTS enterica serovars isolated from the chicken processing environments at wet markets in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A total of 870 samples consisting of carcass dressing water (CDW), chopping board swabs (CBS), and knife swabs (KS) were collected from 29 wet markets. The prevalence of Salmonella was found to be 20% in CDW, 19.31% in CBS, and 17.58% in KS, respectively. Meanwhile, the MDR Salmonella was found to be 72.41%, 73.21%, and 68.62% in CDW, CBS, and KS, respectively. All isolates were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for eight virulence genes, namely inv A, agf A, Ipf A, hil A, siv H, sef A, sop E, and spv C. The S . Enteritidis and untyped Salmonella isolates harbored all virulence genes while S . Typhimurium isolates carried six virulence genes, except sef A and spv C. Phenotypic resistance revealed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and azithromycin. Genotypic resistance showed a higher prevalence of plasmid-mediated bla TEM followed by tet A, sul 1, sul 2, sul 3, and str A/B genes. The phenotypic and genotypic resistance profiles of the isolates showed a harmonic and symmetrical trend. According to the findings, MDR and virulent NTS enterica serovars predominate in wet market conditions and can easily enter the human food chain. The chi-square analysis showed significantly higher associations among the phenotypic resistance, genotypic resistance and virulence genes in CDW, CBS, and KS respectively (p &lt; 0.05)."
https://openalex.org/W4210454792,"Scaffolding proteins can customize the response of signaling networks to support cell development and behaviors. PleC is a bifunctional histidine kinase whose signaling activity coordinates asymmetric cell division to yield a motile swarmer cell and a stalked cell in the gram-negative bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Past studies have shown that PleC's switch in activity from kinase to phosphatase correlates with a change in its subcellular localization pattern from diffuse to localized at the new cell pole. Here we investigated how the bacterial scaffolding protein PodJ regulates the subcellular positioning and activity of PleC. We reconstituted the PleC-PodJ signaling complex through both heterologous expressions in Escherichia coli and in vitro studies. In vitro, PodJ phase separates as a biomolecular condensate that recruits PleC and inhibits its kinase activity. We also constructed an in vivo PleC-CcaS chimeric histidine kinase reporter assay and demonstrated using this method that PodJ leverages its intrinsically disordered region to bind to PleC's PAS sensory domain and regulate PleC-CcaS signaling. Regulation of the PleC-CcaS was most robust when PodJ was concentrated at the cell poles and was dependent on the allosteric coupling between PleC-CcaS's PAS sensory domain and its downstream histidine kinase domain. In conclusion, our in vitro biochemical studies suggest that PodJ phase separation may be coupled to changes in PleC enzymatic function. We propose that this coupling of phase separation and allosteric regulation may be a generalizable phenomenon among enzymes associated with biomolecular condensates."
https://openalex.org/W4210634142,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system with genetics and environmental determinants. Studies focused on the neurogenetics of MS showed that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations that can ultimately lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, alter brain energy metabolism and cause neurodegeneration. We analyzed the whole mitochondrial genome using next-generation sequencing (NGS) from 47 Saudi individuals, 23 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 24 healthy controls to identify mtDNA disease-related mutations/variants. A large number of variants were detected in the D-loop and coding genes of mtDNA. While distinct unique variants were only present in patients or only occur in controls, a number of common variants were shared among the two groups. The prevalence of some common variants differed significantly between patients and controls, thus could be implicated in susceptibility to MS. Of the unique variants only present in the patients, 34 were missense mutations, located in different mtDNA-encoded genes. Seven of these mutations were not previously reported in MS, and predicted to be deleterious with considerable impacts on the functions and structures of encoded-proteins and may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS. These include two heteroplasmic mutations namely 10237T>C in MT-ND3 gene and 15884G>C in MT-CYB gene; and three homoplasmic mutations namely 9288A>G in MT-CO3 gene, 14484T>C in MT-ND6 gene, 15431G>A in MT-CYB gene, 8490T>C in MT-ATP8 gene and 5437C>T in MT-ND2 gene. Notably some patients harboured multiple mutations while other patients carried the same mutations. This study is the first to sequence the entire mitochondrial genome in MS patients in an Arab population. Our results expanded the mutational spectrum of mtDNA variants in MS and highlighted the efficiency of NGS in population-specific mtDNA variant discovery. Further investigations in a larger cohort are warranted to confirm the role of mtDNA MS."
https://openalex.org/W4210797046,"The Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE) is a multiple dimensional measure of cognitive empathy [comprising primary factors for perspective taking (PT), online simulation (OS)], and affective empathy [comprising primary factors for emotion contagion (EC), proximal responsivity (PRO), and peripheral responsivity (PER)]. This study used independent clusters confirmatory factor analysis (ICM-CFA) and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) to examine the scale's factor structure. A general community sample of 203 (men = 43, women = 160) between 17 and 63 years completed the QCAE. Although both the five-factor oblique and second order factor models showed good model fit, and clarity in the pattern of factor loadings, in the second-order factor model, none of the primary factors loaded significantly on their respective secondary factors, thereby favoring the five-factor oblique model. The factors in this model were supported in terms of external validity. Despite this, the factor for PRO in this model showed low reliability for meaning interpretation. A revised four-factor oblique model without the PRO factor showed good fit, clarity in the pattern of factor loadings, and reliability and validity for the factors in this model, thereby suggesting this to be the best model to represent ratings on the QCAE."
https://openalex.org/W4210326405,"The vast majority of adolescent births occur in low- and middle-income countries and are associated with negative outcomes for both the mother and her child. A multitude of risk factors may explain why few programs have been successful in delaying childbearing and suggest that multisectoral interventions may be necessary. This study examines the longer-term impact of a two-year (2015-17) multisectoral program on early sexual debut and fertility in an urban informal settlement in Kenya.The study used a randomized trial design, longitudinally following 2,075 girls 11-14 years old in 2015 until 2019. The interventions included community dialogues on unequal gender norms and their consequences (violence prevention), a conditional cash transfer (education), health and life skills training (health), and financial literacy training and savings activities (wealth). Girls were randomized to one of four study arms: 1) violence prevention only (V-only); 2) V-only and education (VE); 3) VE and health (VEH); or 4) all four interventions (VEHW). We used ANCOVA to estimate intent-to-treat (ITT) impacts of each study arm and of pooled study arms VE, VEH, and VEHW relative to the V-only arm, on primary outcomes of fertility and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) infection, and secondary outcomes of education, health knowledge, and wealth creation. Post-hoc analysis was carried out on older girls who were 13-14-years-old at baseline. In 2018, in the VEHW arm, in-depth qualitative evaluation were carried out with adolescent girls, their parents, school staff, mentors, community conversation facilitators, and community gatekeepers. The trial is registered at ISRCTN: ISRCTN77455458.At endline in the V-only study arm, 21.0 percent of girls reported having had sex, 7.7 percent having ever been pregnant and 6.6 percent having ever given birth, with higher rates for the older subsample at 32.5 percent, 11.8 percent, and 10.1 percent, respectively. In the full sample, ever having given birth was reduced by 2.3 percentage points (pp) in the VE and VEHW study arms, significant at 10 percent. For the older subsample there were larger and significant reductions in the percent ever having had sex (8.2 pp), HSV-2 prevalence (7.5 pp) and HSV-2 incidence (5.6 pp) in the VE arm. Two years after the end of the interventions, girls continued to have increased schooling, sexual and reproductive health knowledge, and improved financial savings behaviors. Qualitatively, respondents reported that girls were likely to have sex as a result of child sexual exploitation, peer pressure or influence from the media, as well as for sexual adventure and as a mark of maturity.This study demonstrates that multisectoral cash plus interventions targeting the community and household level, combined with interventions in the education, health, and wealth-creation sectors that directly target individual girls in early adolescence, generate protective factors against early pregnancy during adolescence. Such interventions, therefore, potentially have beneficial impacts on the longer-term health and economic outcomes of girls residing in impoverished settings.ISRCTN registry: ISRCTN77455458; https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN77455458."
https://openalex.org/W4210328111,"Working under pandemic conditions exposes health care workers (HCWs) to infection risk and psychological strain. A better understanding of HCWs' experiences of following local infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures during COVID-19 is urgently needed to inform strategies for protecting the psychical and psychological health of HCWs. The objective of this study was therefore to capture the perceptions of hospital HCWs on local IPC procedures and the impact on their emotional wellbeing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.Participants were recruited in two sampling rounds of an international cross-sectional survey. Sampling took place between 31 March and 17 April 2020 via existing research networks and between 14 May and 31 August 2020 via online convenience sampling. Main outcome measures were behavioural determinants of HCWs' adherence to IPC guidelines and the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, a validated scale of 0-100 reflecting emotional wellbeing. The WHO-5 was interpreted as a score below or above 50 points, a cut-off score used in previous literature to screen for depression.2289 HCWs from 40 countries in Europe participated. Mean age was 42 (±11) years, 66% were female, 47% and 39% were medical doctors and nurses, respectively. 74% (n = 1699) of HCWs were directly treating patients with COVID-19, of which 32% (n = 527) reported they were fearful of caring for these patients. HCWs reported high levels of concern about COVID-19 infection risk to themselves (71%) and their family (82%) as a result of their job. 40% of HCWs considered that getting infected with COVID-19 was not within their control. This feeling was more common among junior than senior HCWs (46% versus 38%, P value < .01). Sufficient COVID-19-specific IPC training, confidence in PPE use and institutional trust were positively associated with the feeling that becoming infected with COVID-19 was within their control. Female HCWs were more likely than males to report a WHO-5 score below 50 points (aOR 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.8).In Europe, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a differential impact on those providing direct COVID-19 patient care, junior staff and women. Health facilities must be aware of these differential impacts, build trust and provide tailored support for this vital workforce during the current COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4210578556,"We evaluate the efficacy of environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques to locate wild populations and estimate the population size of the endangered big-headed turtle ( Platysternon megacephalum ) in Hong Kong. The results from this study are important for identifying priority sites for protection and further research. Additionally, we assess the impact of two environmental variables (temperature and pH) on eDNA quantity. We surveyed 34 streams for three years, sampling four times each year. Four new populations were first identified with eDNA analysis, and then verified by field surveys. Our multi-year survey highlights that eDNA detection can be inconsistent over time, even in streams with known populations. There was no significant relationship between eDNA quantity and the environmental variables tested. Lastly, our results suggest that eDNA methods remain promising to estimate population size, since number of positive detections were positively correlated with population size in streams with known populations. We conclude that eDNA methods are powerful, but care must be taken when interpreting field results as they are affected by species ecology and environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4210583069,"Evaluation of tourism competitiveness is useful for measuring the level of regional tourism development. It is of great importance to understand the advantages and disadvantages of tourism development correctly and formulate corresponding development strategies. To investigate tourism competitiveness, this paper established an evaluation index system, including tourism development competitiveness, tourism resource competitiveness, and tourism-support competitiveness, for 14 prefectures and cities in Xinjiang in China. The characteristics and laws of spatial differentiation were analyzed. Factor analysis was applied to examine the spatial differentiation of regional tourism competitiveness. The results showed an obvious spatial differentiation in tourism competitiveness among the 14 prefectures and cities. In terms of development competitiveness, Yili and Urumqi constituted the spatial center, followed by Changji, Altay, and Ba Prefecture. As the provincial capital, Urumqi has political, economic, cultural, transportation, and geographic advantages, but its competitiveness is not prominent in terms of monopoly and efficiency. In terms of resource competitiveness, Yili is the core attraction, while Urumqi, Kashgar, Altay, and Ba Prefecture are dominant attractions. With respect to supporting competitiveness, Bo Prefecture has high value, followed by Urumqi City and Aksu. Hetian and Ke Prefecture have the lowest values. The comprehensive competitiveness of tourism is centered on Yili. Urumqi and Bo Prefecture are subcenters, and Changji, Altay, Ba Prefecture, Aksu, and Kashgar are characterized as multi-polar competition areas. Using the KMO and Bartlett's sphericity tests, the cumulative contribution variance of the eigenvalues of the eight factors extracted by the maximum variance rotation method was found to be 92.714%. Socio-economic conditions, tourism resources, infrastructure construction, regional cultural influence, ecological environment carrying capacity, tertiary industry development, tourism service level, and living security system are the main driving factors affecting the spatial differentiation of tourism competitiveness in Xinjiang. Analyzing the spatial evolution characteristics and the driving factors of the regional tourism competitiveness in Xinjiang, this paper seeks to promote the optimal allocation of tourism production factors in the macro regional system, and provide theoretical guidance and an empirical basis for the comprehensive and harmonic development of regional tourism."

An antibody microarray was used to perform comparative proteomic profiling of AF from matched CI (n = 20) and SCX (n = 20) pregnancies. In the total cohort, an ELISA validation study was performed for 15 candidate proteins of interest. Subgroup analyses of patients with CI and SCX were conducted to evaluate the association between the 15 proteins and SPTB at < 32 weeks of gestation.Eighty-six proteins showed intergroup differences. ELISA validation confirmed significantly higher levels of AF EN-RAGE, IL-8, lipocalin-2, MMP-9, S100A8/A9, thrombospondin-2, and TNFR2 in patients with CI than in those with SCX. Multivariable analysis showed that increased AF levels of EN-RAGE, S100A8/A9, and uPA were independently associated with SPTB at < 32 weeks in patients with CI; whereas in patients with SCX, high AF levels of APRIL, EN-RAGE, LBP, and TNFR2 were independently associated with SPTB at < 32 weeks.Multiple AF proteins show altered expression in patients with CI compared with SCX controls. Moreover, several novel mediators involved in inflammation were identified as potential biomarkers for predicting SPTB after the diagnosis of CI and SCX. These results provide new insights into target-specific molecules for targeted therapies to prevent SPTB in patients with CI/SCX."
https://openalex.org/W4210670805,"Adoptive cell therapy with tumor-specific T cells can mediate durable cancer regression. The prime target of tumor-specific T cells are neoantigens arising from mutations in self-proteins during malignant transformation. To understand T cell recognition of cancer neoantigens at the atomic level, we studied oligoclonal T cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize a neoepitope arising from a driver mutation in the p53 oncogene (p53R175H) presented by the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule HLA-A2. We previously reported the structures of three p53R175H-specific TCRs (38-10, 12-6, and 1a2) bound to p53R175H and HLA-A2. The structures showed that these TCRs discriminate between WT and mutant p53 by forming extensive interactions with the R175H mutation. Here, we report the structure of a fourth p53R175H-specific TCR (6-11) in complex with p53R175H and HLA-A2. In contrast to 38-10, 12-6, and 1a2, TCR 6-11 makes no direct contacts with the R175H mutation, yet is still able to distinguish mutant from WT p53. Structure-based in silico mutagenesis revealed that the 60-fold loss in 6-11 binding affinity for WT p53 compared to p53R175H is mainly due to the higher energetic cost of desolvating R175 in the WT p53 peptide during complex formation than H175 in the mutant. This indirect strategy for preferential neoantigen recognition by 6-11 is fundamentally different from the direct strategies employed by other TCRs and highlights the multiplicity of solutions to recognizing p53R175H with sufficient selectivity to mediate T cell killing of tumor but not normal cells."

A two-stage (quantitative survey and qualitative interview [APPEAL-1]), cross-sectional study of the psychosocial burden of peanut allergy (APPEAL-2) was conducted. Quantitative data were evaluated using descriptive statistics and qualitative data were analysed using MAXQDA software. A conceptual model specific to UK and Ireland was developed using the concepts identified during the analysis. A total of 284 adults in the UK and Ireland completed the APPEAL-1 survey and 42 individuals participated in APPEAL-2. Respondents reported that peanut allergy restricts their choices in various situations, especially with regard to choosing food when eating out (87% moderately or severely restricted), choosing where to eat (82%), special occasions (76%) and when buying food from a shop (71%). Fifty-two percent of survey participants and 40% of interview participants reported being bullied because of PA. Psychological impact of peanut allergy included feeling at least moderate levels of frustration (70%), uncertainty (79%), and stress (71%). The qualitative analysis identified three different types of coping strategies (daily monitoring or vigilance, communication and planning) and four main areas of individuals’ lives that are impacted by peanut allergy (social activities, relationships, emotions and work [adults and caregivers only]). The extent of the impact reported varied substantially between participants, with some reporting many negative consequences of living with peanut allergy and others feeling it has minimal impact on their health-related quality of life. This large survey and interview study highlight the psychosocial burden of peanut allergy for adults, teenagers, children and caregivers in the UK and Ireland. The analysis demonstrates the wide variation in level of impact of peanut allergy and the unmet need for those individuals who experience a substantial burden from living with peanut allergy."
https://openalex.org/W4210306434,"Activation of T cells upon engagement of the T cell antigen receptor rapidly leads to a number of phosphorylation and plasma membrane recruitment events. For example, translocation of phospholipase-Cγ1 (PLC-γ1) to the plasma membrane and its association with the transmembrane adapter protein LAT and two other adapter proteins, Gads and SLP-76, are critical events in the early T cell activation process. We have previously characterized the formation of a tetrameric LAT-Gads-SLP-76-PLC-γ1 complex by reconstitution in vitro and have also characterized the thermodynamics of tetramer formation. In the current study, we define how PLC-γ1 recruitment to liposomes, which serve as a plasma membrane surrogate, and PLC-γ1 activation are regulated both independently and additively by recruitment of PLC-γ1 to phosphorylated LAT, by formation of the LAT-Gads-SLP-76-PLC-γ1 tetramer, and by tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1. The recently solved structure of PLC-γ1 indicates that, in the resting state, several PLC-γ1 domains inhibit its enzymatic activity and contact with the plasma membrane. We propose the multiple cooperative steps that we observed likely lead to conformational alterations in the regulatory domains of PLC-γ1, enabling contact with its membrane substrate, disinhibition of PLC-γ1 enzymatic activity, and production of the phosphoinositide cleavage products necessary for T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W4210542901,"Routing protocols for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSN) and underwater Internet of Things (IoT_UWSN) networks have expanded significantly. DBR routing protocol is one of the most critical routing protocols in UWSNs. In this routing protocol, the energy consumption of the nodes, the rate of loss of sent packets, and the rate of drop of routing packets due to node shutdown have created significant challenges. For this purpose, in a new scenario called FB-DBR, clustering is performed, and fuzzy logic and bloom filter are used in each cluster's new routing protocol in underwater wireless sensor networks. Due to the fuzzy nature of the parameters used in DBR, better results are obtained and bloom filters are used in routing tables to compensate for the deceleration. as the average number of accesses to routing table entries, dead nodes, Number of Packets Sent to Base Station (BS), Number of Packets Received at BS, Packet Dropped, and Remaining Energy has improved significantly."
https://openalex.org/W4210913904,"To gain further insight into chromatin-mediated regulation of mammalian sex determination, we analyzed the role of the CHARGE syndrome-associated proteins FAM172A and CHD7. This study is based on our prior discoveries that a subset of corresponding mutant mice display complete male-to-female sex reversal, and that both of these proteins regulate co-transcriptional alternative splicing in neural crest cells. Here, we report that FAM172A and CHD7 are present in the developing gonads when sex determination normally occurs in mice. The interactome of FAM172A in pre-Sertoli cells again suggests a role at the chromatin-spliceosome interface, like in neural crest cells. Accordingly, analysis of Fam172a-mutant pre-Sertoli cells revealed transcriptional and splicing dysregulation of hundreds of genes. Many of these genes are similarly affected in Chd7-mutant pre-Sertoli cells, including several known key regulators of sex determination and subsequent formation of testis cords. Among them, we notably identified Sry as a direct transcriptional target and WNT pathway-associated Lef1 and Tcf7l2 as direct splicing targets. The identified molecular defects are also associated with the abnormal morphology of seminiferous tubules in mutant postnatal testes. Altogether, our results thus identify FAM172A and CHD7 as new players in the regulation of male sex determination and differentiation in mice, and further highlight the importance of chromatin-mediated regulatory mechanisms in these processes."
https://openalex.org/W4226176765,"P75 pan-neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is an important receptor for the role of neurotrophins in survival and death of neurons during development and after nerve injury. Our previous research found that the precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) regulates pain as an inflammatory mediator. The current understanding of the role of proBDNF/p75NTR signaling pathway in inflammatory arthritis pain and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unclear. We recruited 20 RA patients, 20 healthy donors (HDs), and 10 osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of proBDNF and p75NTR in synovial membrane were performed and evaluated. We next examined the mRNA and protein expression of proBDNF/p75NTR signaling pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and synovial tissue. ELISA and flow cytometry were assessed between the blood of RA patients and HD. To induce RA, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were induced in mice. We found over-synovitis of RA synovial membrane compared to OA controls in histologic sections. P75NTR and sortilin mRNA, and proBDNF protein level were significantly increased in PBMCs of RA patients compared with the HD. Consistently, ELISA showed that p75NTR, sortilin, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in the serum of RA patients were increased compared with HD and p75NTR, sortilin were positively correlated with Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28). In addition, using flow cytometry we showed that the increased levels of proBDNF and p75NTR characterized in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of RA patients were subsequently reversed with methotrexate (MTX) treatment. Furthermore, we found pathological changes, inflammatory pain, upregulation of the mRNA and protein expression of proBDNF/p75NTR signaling pathway, and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in spinal cord using a well-established CIA mouse model. We showed intravenous treatment of recombinant p75ECD-Fc that biologically blocked all inflammatory responses and relieved inflammatory pain of animals with CIA. Our findings showed the involvement of proBDNF/p75NTR pathway in the RA inflammatory response and how blocking it with p75ECD-Fc may be a promising therapeutic treatment for RA."
https://openalex.org/W4210356909,"The transition to small family size is at an advanced phase in India, with a national TFR of 2.2 in 2015-16. This paper examines the roles of four key determinants of fertility-marriage, contraception, abortion and postpartum infecundability-for India, all 29 states and population subgroups.Data from the most recent available national survey, the National Family Health Survey, conducted in 2015-16, were used. The Bongaarts proximate determinants model was used to quantify the roles of the four key factors that largely determine fertility. Methodological contributions of this analysis are: adaptations of the model to the Indian context; measurement of the role of abortion; and provision of estimates for sub-groups nationally and by state: age, education, residence, wealth status and caste.Nationally, marriage is the most important determinant of the reduction in fertility from the biological maximum, contributing 36%, followed by contraception and abortion, contributing 24% and 23% respectively, and post-partum infecundability contributed 16%. This national pattern of contributions characterizes most states and subgroups. Abortion makes a larger contribution than contraception among young women and better educated women. Findings suggest that sterility and infertility play a greater than average role in Southern states; marriage practices in some Northeastern states; and male migration for less-educated women. The absence of stronger relationships between the key proximate fertility determinants and geography or socio-economic status suggests that as family size declined, the role of these determinants is increasingly homogenous.Findings argue for improvements across all states and subgroups, in provision of contraceptive care and safe abortion services, given the importance of these mechanisms for implementing fertility preferences. In-depth studies are needed to identify policy and program needs that depend on the barriers and vulnerabilities that exist in specific areas and population groups."
https://openalex.org/W4210385439,"Women experience high rates of depression, particularly during pregnancy and the postpartum periods. Using population-based data from Bangladesh and Pakistan, we estimated the burden of antenatal depression, its risk factors, and its effect on preterm birth.The study uses the following data: maternal depression measured between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation using the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); data on pregnancy including an ultrasound before 19 weeks of gestation; data on pregnancy outcomes; and data on woman's age, education, parity, weight, height, history of previous illness, prior miscarriage, stillbirth, husband's education, and household socioeconomic data collected during early pregnancy. Using PHQ-9 cutoff score of ≥12, women were categorized into none to mild depression or moderate to moderately severe depression. Using ultrasound data, preterm birth was defined as babies born <37 weeks of gestation. To identify risk ratios (RR) for antenatal depression, unadjusted and adjusted RR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using log- binomial model. Log-binomial models were also used for determining the effect of antenatal depression on preterm birth adjusting for potential confounders. Data were analyzed using Stata version 16 (StataCorp LP).About 6% of the women reported moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms during the antenatal period. A parity of ≥2 and the highest household wealth status were associated with an increased risk of depression. The overall incidence of preterm birth was 13.4%. Maternal antenatal depression was significantly associated with the risk of preterm birth (ARR, 95% CI: 1.34, 1.02-1.74).The increased risk of preterm birth in women with antenatal depression in conjunction with other significant risk factors suggests that depression likely occurs within a constellation of other risk factors. Thus, to effectively address the burden of preterm birth, programs require developing and providing integrated care addressing multiple risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W4210778065,"In the context of studies on the effects of agricultural production diversity, there are debates in the scientific community as to the level of diversification appropriate for improving dietary diversity. In Tunisia, agriculture is a strategic sector for the economy and a critical pillar of its food sovereignty. Using instrumental variable methods to account for endogeneity, we have estimated the association between agricultural production diversity and women's dietary diversity among smallholder farming households in the Sidi Bouzid governorate (central Tunisia). Although we found a low level of agricultural production diversity and a fairly diversified diet among women, we observed a systematic weak positive association between five different indicators of agricultural production diversity and women's dietary diversity. We observed a stronger positive association between women's dietary diversity and women being more educated and households being wealthier. Neither diversity of food supplies in food markets nor market distance were associated with women's dietary diversity, whereas we observed a higher level of consumption of some products (dairy) when they were produced on the farm."
https://openalex.org/W4225502852,"In visual cortex, signals from the two eyes merge to form a coherent binocular representation. Here we investigate the synaptic interactions underlying the binocular representation of stimulus orientation in ferret visual cortex with in vivo calcium imaging of layer 2/3 neurons and their dendritic spines. Individual neurons with aligned somatic responses received a mixture of monocular and binocular synaptic inputs. Surprisingly, monocular pathways alone could not account for somatic alignment because ipsilateral monocular inputs poorly matched somatic preference. Binocular inputs exhibited different degrees of interocular alignment, and those with a high degree of alignment (congruent) had greater selectivity and somatic specificity. While congruent inputs were similar to others in measures of strength, simulations show that the number of active congruent inputs predicts aligned somatic output. Our study suggests that coherent binocular responses derive from connectivity biases that support functional amplification of aligned signals within a heterogeneous binocular intracortical network."
https://openalex.org/W4210322790,"Due to demographic change with an ageing workforce, the proportion of employees with poor health and a need for medical rehabilitation is increasing. The aim was to investigate if older employees with migrant background have a different need for and utilization of medical rehabilitation than employees without migrant background. To investigate this, self-reported data from older German employees born in 1959 or 1965 of the first and second study wave of the lidA cohort study were exploratory analyzed (n = 3897). Subgroups of employees with migrant background were separated as first-generation, which had either German or foreign nationality, and second-generation vs. the rest as non-migrants. All subgroups were examined for their need for and utilization of medical rehabilitation with descriptive and bivariate statistics (chi-square, F- and post-hoc tests). Furthermore, multiple logistic regressions and average marginal effects were calculated for each migrant group separately to assess the effect of need for utilization of rehabilitation. According to our operationalizations, the foreign and German first-generation migrants had the highest need for medical rehabilitation while the German first- and second-generation migrants had the highest utilization in the bivariate analysis. However, the multiple logistic model showed significant positive associations between their needs and utilization of rehabilitation for all subgroups. Further in-depth analysis of the need showed that something like under- and oversupply co-exist in migrant groups, while the foreign first-generation migrants with lower need were the only ones without rehabilitation usage. However, undersupply exists in all groups independent of migrant status. Concluding, all subgroups showed suitable use of rehabilitation according to their needs at first sight. Nevertheless, the utilization does not appear to have met all needs, and therefore, the need-oriented utilization of rehabilitation should be increased among all employees, e.g. by providing more information, removing barriers or identifying official need with uniform standards."

Extracted DNA was subjected to hybrid-capture based next generation sequencing. Blood and ascites were sampled before surgery and on subsequent post-surgical days. 20 patients (10 undergoing complete resection (TR0), 10 undergoing incomplete resection (TR>0)) were included.The minor allele frequency (MAF) of TP53 mutations in ct-DNA of all patients with TR0 decreased significantly, compared to only one patient with TR>0. It was not possible to distinguish between patients with TR0 and patients with TR>0, using CA125 and HE4 from blood and ascites.Based upon the present findings, ct-DNA assessment in patients with high-grade serous EOC might help to better determine disease burden compared to standard tumor markers. Further studies should prospectively evaluate whether this enhancement of accuracy can help to optimize management of patients with EOC."
https://openalex.org/W4210520637,"In the past decade, the cleavage protein irisin derived from fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) in exercise-stimulated skeletal muscle has increasingly become a biomarker associated with metabolic syndrome and osteoporosis in humans. However, it is unclear how this protein facilitates muscle-adipose-bone connectivity in metabolic and skeletal homeostasis. In this study, we unexpectedly observed that the FNDC5 gene can be markedly activated during the differentiation of brown adipocytes but not white adipocytes, and that FNDC5 is specifically expressed in mouse brown adipose tissues (BATs). But unlike it in the skeletal muscles, the expression of FNDC5/irisin in BAT is promoted by cold exposure rather than exercise in mice. Analysis of promoter activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation further showed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α and thyroid hormone receptors cooperate on the FNDC5 gene promoter to induce its transcription. We found that FNDC5/irisin stimulates the runt-related transcriptional factors RUNX1/2 via a focal adhesion kinase-dependent pathway in both bone and subcutaneous white adipose tissues. Mechanistically, focal adhesion kinase is stimulated by FNDC5/irisin and then facilitates E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase WW domain-containing protein 2 to ubiquitinate and subsequently activate RUNX1/2, culminating in the activation of osteoblast-related or thermogenesis-related genes. Interestingly, the PR domain containing protein 16 that is crucial for subcutaneous white adipose ""browning"" and skeletal development was found to form a complex with RUNX1/2 in a WW domain-containing protein 2-dependent manner. These findings elucidate a signaling mechanism by which FNDC5/irisin supports the muscle-adipose-bone connectivity, especially BAT-bone connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W4210548663,"The mechanical properties of loess-steel interface are of great significance for understanding the residual strength and deformation of loess. However, the undisturbed loess has significant structural properties, while the remolded loess has weak structural properties. There are few reports on the mechanical properties of loess-steel interface from the structural point of view. This paper focused on the ring shear test between undisturbed loess as well as its remolded loess and steel interface under the same physical mechanics and test conditions (water content, shear rate and vertical pressure), and explored the influence mechanism of structure on the mechanical deformation characteristics of steel-loess interface. The results show that the shear rate has little effect on the residual strength of the undisturbed and remolded loess-steel interface. However, the water content has a significant influence on the residual strength of the loess-steel interface, moreover, the residual internal friction angle is the dominant factor supporting the residual strength of the loess-steel interface. In general, the residual strength of the undisturbed loess-steel interface is greater than that of the remolded loess specimen (for example, the maximum percentage of residual strength difference between undisturbed and remolded loess specimens under the same moisture content is 6.8%), which is because that compared with the mosaic arrangement structure of the remolded loess, the overhead arrangement structure of the undisturbed loess skeleton particles makes the loess particles on the loess-steel interface re-adjust the arrangement direction earlier and reach a stable speed relatively faster. The loess particles with angular angles in the undisturbed loess make the residual internal friction between the particles greater than the smoother particles of the remolded loess (for example, the maximum percentage of residual cohesion difference between undisturbed and remolded loess specimens under the same vertical pressure is 4.29%), and the intact cement between undisturbed loess particles brings stronger cohesion than the remolded loess particles with destroyed cement (for example, the maximum difference percentage of residual cohesion between undisturbed and remolded soil specimens under the same vertical pressure is 33.80%). The test results provide experimental basis for further revealing the influence mechanism of structure, and parameter basis for similar engineering construction."

Nevertheless, its chemical composition and therapeutic mechanism are unclear. This study aimed to uncover the potentially effective components of ELP and the pharmacological mechanisms against RA by combing UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and network pharmacology. In this study, 96 compounds of ELP were identified or tentatively characterized based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis. Then, a total of 22 potential bioactive compounds were screened by TCMSP with oral bioavailability and drug-likeness. Preliminarily, 10 crucial targets may be associated with RA through protein-protein interaction network analysis. The functional enrichment analysis indicated that ELP exerted anti-RA effects probably by synergistically regulating many biological pathways, such as PI3K-Akt, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, JAK-STAT, MAPK, TNF, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. In addition, good molecular docking scores were highlighted between five promising bioactive compounds (ellagic acid, quercetin, kaempferol, galangin, coptisine) and five core targets (PTGS2, STAT3, VEGFA, MAPK3, TNF). Overall, ELP can exert its anti-RA activity via multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel mechanisms of action. However, further studies are needed to validate the biological processes and effect pathways of ELP."

Sarcosine oxidase (SOX, EC. 1.5.3.1) oxidizes the -C-N- bond of sarcosine (N-methyl-Gly) or L-abrine (N-methyl-L-Trp) into the -C=N- bond and finally exposes the primary amine (Fig. 2, 1→2a→2b and 3→4a→4b), using a covalently linked FAD or flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as the cofactor (21Abe Y. Shoji M. Nishiya Y. Aiba H. Kishimotod T. Kitaurae K. The reaction mechanism of sarcosine oxidase elucidated using FMO and QM/MM methods.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2017; 19: 9811-9822Google Scholar). Recently, most members of the SOX family were screened from fungi and bacteria and have been used in the detection of serum creatinine for clinical diagnosis of kidney diseases or in the monitoring of glycerol or organic acid in the food industry (22Xin Y. Hao M.Y. Fan G.M. Zhang Y. Zhang L. Soluble expression of Thermomicrobium roseum sarcosine oxidase and characterization of N-demethylation activity.Mol.

Promote the expression and corrected folding of an extremely stable N-demethylase by promoter reconstruction, native environment simulation and surface design.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2021; 178: 434-443Google Scholar). SOXs have not been well investigated in terms of other potential substrates except N-methyl-Gly or N-methyl-L-Trp. In addition, L-abrine is an acute toxic alkaloid (24Johnson R.C. Zhou Y.T. Jain R. Lemire S.W. Fox S. Sabourin P. Barr J.R. Quantification of L-abrine in human and rat urine: A biomarker for the toxin abrin.J. Anal. Toxicol. 2009; 33: 77-84Google Scholar), and it can be converted into L-Trp by SOXs without toxicity. Recently, because the alkaloid compounds have been widely used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry (25Zhao S.Z. Sirasani G. Andrade R.B. Aspidosperma and strychnos alkaloids: Chemistry and biology.Alkaloids Chem. Biol. 2021; 86: 1-143Google Scholar, 26Wicks C. Hudlicky T. Rinner U. Morphine alkaloids: History, biology, and synthesis.Alkaloids Chem. Biol. 2021; 86: 145-342Google Scholar), they have become significant pollutants in food (27Han H.L. Jiang C.L. Wang C. Liu X. Lu C.Y. Chen H.P. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids in tea: A review of analytical methods, contamination levels and health risk.Food Sci. 2021; 42: 255-266Google Scholar), pharmaceuticals, plant extracts, municipal and hospital wastewaters (24Johnson R.C.

Cytostatic drugs and metabolites in municipal and hospital wastewaters in Spain: Filtration, occurrence, and environmental risk.Sci. Total Environ. 2014; 497-498: 68-77Google Scholar), and they have also been considered a potential risk for bioterrorism (29Janik E. Ceremuga M. Saluk-Bijak J. Bijak M. Biological toxins as the potential tools for bioterrorism.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 1181Google Scholar). Alkaloids contain different types of terminal and main chain -C-N- bonds (30Qin J. Zhang S.Y. Zhang Y.B. Chen L.F. Chen N.H. Wu Z.N. Luo D. Wang G.C. Li Y.L. Two new isoquinoline alkaloids from the seeds of Nandina domestica.Nat. Prod.

N-methyl inversion and accurate equilibrium structures in alkaloids: Pseudopelletierine.Chemistry. 2017; 23: 16491-16496Google Scholar), and the N-demethylation or break down of -C-N- bonds could help to produce the corresponding compounds or promote their degradation (16Kok G.B. Pye C.C. Singer R.D. Scammells P.J. Two-step iron(o)-mediated N-demethylation of N-methyl alkaloids.J. Org. Chem. 2010; 75: 4806-4811Google Scholar). Therefore, the N-demethylation activity of SOXs can be a potential method for detoxification treatment after alkaloid pollution. In our previous studies, the SOX enzyme (TrSOX, GenBank: ACM06094.1) was obtained from Thermomicrobium roseum surviving in the basic hot springs of the Yellowstone National Park, and it had outstanding resistance against temperature (Tm > 100 °C), pH, and organic solvents; however, the poor recombinant expression level was a challenge for the characterization and application of this enzyme; and through surface design, a single mutant-TrSOX (S320R) far from the catalytic center was built with an over 20-fold promotion in soluble expression (22Xin Y. Hao M.Y. Fan G.M. Zhang Y. Zhang L. Soluble expression of Thermomicrobium roseum sarcosine oxidase and characterization of N-demethylation activity.Mol. Catal. 2019; 464: 48-56Google Scholar, 23Gao Q.Y. Shao J. Tang M.W. Xin Y. Zhang L. Promote the expression and corrected folding of an extremely stable N-demethylase by promoter reconstruction, native environment simulation and surface design.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2021; 178: 434-443Google Scholar). Although the structures of several modern SOXs from Escherichia coli or Bacillus have been elucidated (32Ilari A. Bonamore A. Franceschini S. Fiorillo A. Boffi A. Colotti G. The X-ray structure of N-methyltryptophan oxidase reveals the structural determinants of substrate specificity.Proteins. 2008; 71: 2065-2075Google Scholar, 33Nagata K. Sasaki H.

To optimize the structural and catalytic properties of enzymes, directed evolution and rational design are considered universal protocols. Directed evolution requires large-scale mutant libraries and high-throughput screening protocols. The rational design is more efficient for regulating the folding–unfolding equilibrium by destabilizing unfolding and stabilizing the folded conformation (36Kazlauskas R. Engineering more stable proteins.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2018; 47: 9026-9045Google Scholar), localizing potential hotspots for rational design, or using semirational and de novo design (37Liu Q. Xun G.H. Feng Y. The state-of-the-art strategies of protein engineering for enzyme stabilization.Biotechnol. Adv. 2019; 37: 530-537Google Scholar) and the B-FIT-directed evolution method (38Sun Z.T. Liu Q. Qu G. Feng Y. Reetz M.T. Utility of B-factors in protein science: Interpreting rigidity, flexibility, and internal motion and engineering thermostability.Chem. Rev. 2019; 119: 1626-1665Google Scholar). However, significantly promoting the stability of a specific enzyme is always a challenge. Recently, starting from the sequences of well-studied modern enzymes, ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) has been applied to studying the evolutionary history of homologous families because ancestors in older nodes may possess specific properties produced in certain environments over billions of years of evolution, enhancing the thermostability of target enzymes (39Nguyen V. Wilson C. Hoemberger M. Stiller J.B. Agafonov R.V. Kutter S. English H. Theobald D.L. Kern D. Evolutionary drivers of thermoadaptation in enzyme catalysis.Science. 2017; 355: 289-294Google Scholar, 40Ayuso-Fernández I. Rencoret J. Gutiérrez A. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez A.T. Peroxidase evolution in white-rot fungi follows wood lignin evolution in plants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 17900-17905Google Scholar, 41Clifton B.E. Kaczmarski J.A. Carr P.D. Gerth M.L. Tokuriki N. Jackson C.J. Evolution of cyclohexadienyl dehydratase from an ancestral solute-binding protein.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14: 542-547Google Scholar). Properties of ancestors have previously been used as references to promote the stability of modern enzymes (42Schriever K. Saenz-Mendez P. Rudraraju R.S. Hendrikse N.M. Hudson E.P. Biundo A. Schnell R. Syrén P. Engineering of ancestors as a tool to elucidate structure, mechanism, and specificity of extant terpene cyclase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021; 143: 3794-3807Google Scholar). In most of the ASR-associated studies, some fractional features of ancestral enzymes were introduced into modern ones in order to promote the stability, but it did not always work. We supposed that the stability of an enzyme should be associated with the whole framework but not only several limited sites; therefore, in this work, a different strategy was employed. After the structure of TrSOX was elucidated using crystallization and XRD, the stable framework of TrSOX was used as the starting model. The natural evolutionary trends of nonconserved residues in the catalytic loop, substrate pocket, coenzyme pocket, and entrance site were identified by ASR, using approximately 100 homologous sequences, including modern and hypothetical SOXs. Furthermore, site-directed mutations were employed to recreate the substitutions occurring in these four regions during evolution, and the structural and catalytic properties were characterized. The structure of TrSOX (S320R) was solved by molecular replacement at 1.42 Å resolution, using a homologous model (PDB ID: 2GF3) as reference, and the data were deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 7EXS) (Fig. 3A). In sequence alignment and ASR, almost all the homologous enzymes sharing over 50% sequence identities with TrSOX were uncharacterized ones (Fig. 3B). The low sequence identities of TrSOX with homologous enzymes, e.g., PDB ID: 2UZZ (35.10%), 2A89 (39.90%), 3BHF (40.18%), 2GF3 (40.00%), 3M13 (40.18%), and 1ZOV (39.67%), indicated that there were significant evolutionary distances. In our previous work, the model of TrSOX was simulated using the above structures, and the low-soluble expression level of TrSOX was attributed to the high hydrophobic area (over 40%) on the solvent-accessible surface (23Gao Q.Y. Shao J. Tang M.W. Xin Y. Zhang L. Promote the expression and corrected folding of an extremely stable N-demethylase by promoter reconstruction, native environment simulation and surface design.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2021; 178: 434-443Google Scholar); however, in the crystal structure of TrSOX, hydrophobic area on the surface was less than 30%—almost the same as those of the modern homologs. This difference indicated that the models with significant evolutionary distances could not help to understand the structure of an unsolved one. Therefore, in this work, the structural resolution of TrSOX helped fill the informational gaps in the phylogenetic tree of this family, and it could be considered as the reference for the research of other homologs with closer evolutionary distances (Fig. 3B). In the structure of TrSOX, there were four Cys residues at sites 153, 158, 274, and 312, C312 was covalently linked with FAD, and there was no disulfide bridge (Fig. 3C). To maintain the stable framework of TrSOX, we hope to bring as few changes as possible to limited sites. Through ASR, the natural evolutionary process of nonconserved residuals in key microdomains, which should play vital roles in enzymatic reactions, including catalytic loop, coenzyme pocket, substrate pocket, and entrance site, were identified (Fig. 3, C and D). Ten of the 18 identified substitutions accruing in natural evolution in the catalytic loop (residues 57–62: -YFESPE-) (Fig. 3, C and D) were prepared and characterized (Table S1). In Figure 4, A–D, as for the native TrSOX, none of the mutants were active against N-methyl-D-amino acids; all these substitutions showed outstanding thermostability similar to the initial frame work, with Tm at ∼100 °C, ΔH above 500 kJ/mol, optimal reaction temperature at 80 °C, and the 80 °C active half-lives at ∼72 h. F58G and P61E could promote the catalytic efficiency against most of the initial substrates (Fig. 2, 3→4a, 5→6a, 7→8a, 9→10a, 11→12a and 17→18a). However, S60G led to an over 40-fold enhanced activity against N-methyl-L-Asp (Fig. 2, 9→10a), with a dramatic decrease in activity for substrates with hydrophobic side chains (Fig. 2, 3→4a, 7→8a, 11→12a). The benzene ring of F58 was close to the substrate pocket, while S60 and P61 were relatively distanced (Fig. 4E). The substitution of Phe by Gly at site-58 might reduce the steric hindrance outside of the substrate cavity and enlarge its volume (Fig. 4F) and then promote the accessibility of most of the initial substrates except N-methyl-Gly and N-methyl-L-Phe, as F58G showed increased Km values for these two substrates; furthermore, the expanded substrate cavity led to the enhanced catalytic ratio (Table S1). S60G and P61E were unable to affect the size of the substrate pocket (Fig. 4, G and H), and they may act as navigators of the substrate outside of the pocket, as described in our previous study (23Gao Q.Y. Shao J. Tang M.W. Xin Y. Zhang L. Promote the expression and corrected folding of an extremely stable N-demethylase by promoter reconstruction, native environment simulation and surface design.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2021; 178: 434-443Google Scholar). Phe and Pro at site-58 and 61 were hydrophobic and rigid residues (43Yu H.R. Zhao Y. Guo C. Gan Y.R. Huang H. The role of proline substitutions within flexible regions on thermostability of luciferase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1854: 65-72Google Scholar), and they should play vital roles in the structure and function of the catalytic loop. Double substitutions containing one of these two residues, e.g., F58G/S60G and S60G/P61E, exhibited higher Km values and lower catalytic efficiency against substrates with hydrophobic side chains (Tables 1 and S1). Another double substitution, F58G/P61E was not as efficient as the two single substitutions; it should be attributed to the substitutions of these two rigid and hydrophobic residues by soft and hydrophilic ones, which might promote the flexibility and vibration of the catalytic loop.Table 1The specific catalytic efficiency of positive mutants in key microdomainsSubstrateSpecific catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km)NativeCatalytic loopCoenzyme pocketSubstrate pocketEntrance sitkcat/Km (M−1 × min−1)Specific efficiencyF58GS60GP61EF58G/S60GS60G/P61EF58G/P61ES46TI52VV174AL209VF243YI244TE251VY253AS320RS320K11002.910.7181.950.7450.1250.3230.1670.0961.272.550.5578.763.450.1410.0372.411.0537231.0133.30.3445.175.331.528.946.866.720.1750.2610.270.3040.4970.20332.4525.74510070.911.698.182.041.832.831.870.4070.4290.7030.3236.923.031.190.0644.174.49712461.5116.90.0213.80.1140.29914.83.984.160.5965.1917.734631.11.656.63282.23912.612.0343.32.92.193.040.794--3.2666.975018811.4-13.571760.38118413.216.130.03618.70.5170.34.578.762.783.390.46826.528229.22.8533.2455.4113--------------Novel---15 L-Pro---------Novel-Novel-NovelNovelNovel-Novel D-Pro-------------Novel----17176.818.9411.69.990.0130.0070.00932.8-5.93-60.45.21.0613.313.0565.8419--------------NovelNovel--21----------Novel---NovelNovel--23--------------Novel--25--------------NovelNovel--27--------------NovelNovel--29--------------NovelNovel--The kcat/Km of native TrSOX for substrate 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 17 were set as 1. Open table in a new tab The kcat/Km of native TrSOX for substrate 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 17 were set as 1. Ten of the 15 substitutions accruing in natural evolution in the coenzyme pocket (Fig. 3, C and D) were prepared and characterized (Table S2). Of note, the enantioselectivity for substrates and thermostability were always retained (Fig. 5, A–D); S46T promoted the catalytic efficiency against substrates with large and hydrophobic side chains (Fig. 2, 3→4a, 7→8a, 11→12a); I52V and L209V revealed activity against L-Pro (Fig. 2, 15→16), L209V showed a ∼67-fold promotion against N-methyl-L-Asp (Fig. 2, 9→10a), while V174A revealed activity against (R)-2-methyl-pyrrolidine (Fig. 2, 21→22) (Table 1). For the nonconserved sites in coenzyme pocket, S46T (Fig. 5F), V174A (Fig. 5H), and L209V (Fig. 5I) were relatively far away and resulted in no significant differences in substrate pocket, and they might affect the whole structure of the enzyme by binding with the cofactor and regulate catalytic properties by affecting the electron transfer chain through FAD; the detailed mechanism should be investigated through crystallization and XRD in our further work; I52 (Fig. 5G) was located at the bottom of the substrate pocket, and it could enlarge the volume of substrate pocket. Double mutants including S46T/V174A, S46T/L209V, and V174A/L209V were designed; however, these could not be expressed in the soluble form as FAD was covalently linked with the enzyme, and it may play a vital role in the natural folding process, multiple mutants close to the coenzyme might have disrupted the entire structure of the enzyme. Thirty one of the 41 substitutions accruing in natural evolution in substrate pocket (Fig. 3, C and D) were prepared and characterized (Table S3). Notably, the enantioselectivity for substrates and thermostability were also always maintained (Fig. 6, A–D); F243Y and I244T dramatically enhanced the catalytic efficiency against N-methyl-L-amino acids except for N-methyl-L-Trp (Fig. 2, 3→4a); F243Y brought a ∼750-fold enhanced activity for N-methyl-L-Asp (Fig. 2, 9→10a), while I244T showed activities against both of L- and D-Pro without enantioselectivity. Mutants at residues 245, 251, and 253 showed significantly decreased activity against N-methyl-L-Gly (Fig. 2, 1→2a); however, the substrate scope was enlarged, and especially for E251V, which could recognize non-amino-acid compounds or nitrogen-containing heterocycles, including N-Methyl-1-naphthalenemethylamine (Fig. 2, 13→14a), L-Pro (Fig. 2, 15→16a), L-homoproline (Fig. 2, 17→18a), L-Hydroxyproline (Fig. 2, 19→20), (R)-2-methyl-pyrrolidine (Fig. 2, 21→22), (3R)-(+)-3-(ethylamino)pyrrolidine (Fig. 2, 23→24), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (Fig. 2, 25→26,), 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (Fig. 2, 27→28), and hexamethyleneimine (Fig. 2, 29→30) (Table 1).Table 2The specific catalytic efficiency of positive multiple mutantsSubstrateSpecific catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km)NativeE251VMultiple mutantskcat/Km (M−1 × min−1)Specific efficiencykcat/Km (M−1 × min−1)Specific efficiencyS320K/F243YS320K/P61ES320K/E251VE251V/P61ES320K/E251V/P61E11002.91141.10.14111.40.2370.0840.0570.04537231.013595.80.4971.581.690.3180.2230.13510070.9111976.61.198.381.160.5911.840.994712461.51387,237.331.147812.18.6912.829.6912.61144.011.46230149.35.529.19118413.21245751.329.293.4118.2944918.113--13.41--0.253-2.7415--22.6111.40.9573.081.121.9817176.81187.91.061284.412.761.381.8919--7.71--1.960.3662.6421--0.21--4.79--23--0.31--2.463.544.1925--4.01--2.622.943.4627--17.71--0.1230.0340.31929--16.31--0.1240.1660.075The kcat/Km of native TrSOX for substrate 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 17 were set as 1; the kcat/Km of E251V for substrate 13, 15, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29 were set as 1. Open table in a new tab The kcat/Km of native TrSOX for substrate 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 17 were set as 1; the kcat/Km of E251V for substrate 13, 15, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29 were set as 1. E251 and Y253 were located in one beta-sheet next to the substrate pocket, while F243 and I244 were in another parallel sheet (Fig. 6E). F243Y was positioned at the bottom of the substrate pocket, and it resulted in no significant difference in the volume of the pocket; but Y243 was closer to V92 (carbon hydrogen bond) and Y253 (newly formed amide-Pi stacked), which might affect the arrangement of the two-parallel beta-sheets in substrate pocket (Fig. 6F). With the enlarged substrate pocket volume (Fig. 6G), I244T promoted the activity except for N-methyl-L-Trp (Fig. 2, 3→4a), and D or L-Pro could both be recognized. E251V was positioned at the top of the substrate pocket, and it led to the decreasing of the pocket volume and the hydrophilicity (Fig. 6H), which could promote the accessibility of substrates with hydrophobic side chains. Y253A was positioned at the bottom of the substrate pocket, which enlarged the volume of the pocket (Fig. 6I). As the above four sites were all located on two parallel beta-sheets (Fig. 6E), the proximity of the multiple substitutions might disrupt the corrected folding, the double mutants designed of these sites could not be expressed in soluble form. As reported (21Abe Y. Shoji M. Nishiya Y. Aiba H. Kishimotod T. Kitaurae K. The reaction mechanism of sarcosine oxidase elucidated using FMO and QM/MM methods.Phys. Chem. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W4210755115,"The incidence of acetabular fractures due to low-energy falls is increasing among the geriatric population. Studies have shown that several biomechanical factors such as body configuration, impact velocity, and trochanteric soft-tissue thickness contribute to the severity and type of acetabular fracture. The effect of reduction in apparent density and elastic modulus of bone as well as other bone mechanical properties due to osteoporosis on low-energy acetabular fractures has not been investigated.The current comprehensive finite element study aimed to study the effect of reduction in bone mechanical properties (trabecular, cortical, and trabecular + cortical) on the risk and type of acetabular fracture. Also, the effect of reduction in the mechanical properties of bone on the load-transferring mechanism within the pelvic girdle was examined.We observed that while the reduction in the mechanical properties of trabecular bone considerably affects the severity and area of trabecular bone failure, reduction in mechanical properties of cortical bone moderately influences both cortical and trabecular bone failure. The results also indicated that by reducing bone mechanical properties, the type of acetabular fracture turns from elementary to associated, which requires a more extensive intervention and rehabilitation period. Finally, we observed that the cortical bone plays a substantial role in load transfer, and by increasing reduction in the mechanical properties of cortical bone, a greater share of load is transmitted toward the pubic symphysis.This study increases our understanding of the effect of osteoporosis progression on the incidence of low-energy acetabular fractures. The osteoporosis-related reduction in the mechanical properties of cortical bone appears to affect both the cortical and trabecular bones. Also, during the extreme reduction in the mechanical properties of bone, the acetabular fracture type will be more complicated. Finally, during the final stages of osteoporosis (high reduction in mechanical properties of bone) a smaller share of impact load is transferred by impact-side hemipelvis to the sacrum, therefore, an osteoporotic pelvis might mitigate the risk of sacral fracture."
https://openalex.org/W4210773037,"The objective of this study was to demonstrate that BCD-057 is similar to innovator adalimumab (iADA) in terms of efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics in steady state in the target population of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (NCT02762955).Patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive 80 mg of BCD-057 or iADA at week 0 and 40 mg thereafter every other week from week 1. At week 24 patients from iADA group were re-randomized (1:1) to continue iADA or to be switched to BCD-057. The primary efficacy endpoint was 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index from baseline (PASI 75), secondary endpoints included PASI percent improvement and relative change in affected Body Surface Area (BSA) from baseline at weeks 16, 24, 33, and 55. Safety was assessed through monitoring of adverse events (AEs) and antidrug antibodies. Pharmacokinetics was evaluated at steady state.Overall, 346 adult patients were included in the study (174/172 patients in BCD-057/iADA arms, respectively). At week 16 PASI 75 was achieved by 60.34% and 63.37% of patients in BCD-057 and iADA arms, respectively (p = 0.5622). Bounds of the calculated 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between PASI 75 responses in arms [-13.26%; 7.2%] fall within the equivalence margin [-15% to 15%] demonstrating equivalent efficacy of BCD-057 and iADA. At week 55 81.61%, 85.56%, and 80.49% of patients in BCD-057, iADA and iADA/BCD-057 arms achieved PASI 75. Comparison of the secondary endpoints did not show significant differences between arms. A comparable pharmacokinetics was shown at steady state. Safety profiles and proportions of patients with antidrug antibodies were similar between arms. The switch from the iADA to BCD-057 did not affect the immunogenicity profile.Obtained data demonstrate that BCD-057 and iADA are highly similar in clinical efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety, and immunogenicity in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis."
https://openalex.org/W2962134334,"Allosteric disulfide bonds permit highly responsive, transient ‘switch-like’ properties that are ideal for processes like coagulation and inflammation that require rapid and localised responses to damage or injury. Haemophilia A (HA) is a rare bleeding disorder managed with exogenous coagulation factor(F) VIII products. FVIII has eight disulfide bonds and is known to be redox labile, but it is not known how reduction/oxidation affects the structure-function relationship, or its immunogenicity—a serious complication for 30% severe HA patients. Understanding how redox-mediated changes influence FVIII can inform molecular engineering strategies aimed at improving activity and stability, and reducing immunogenicity. FVIII is a challenging molecule to work with owing to its poor expression and instability so, in a proof-of-concept study, we used molecular dynamics (MD) to identify which disulfide bonds were most likely to be reduced and how this would affect structure/function; results were then experimentally verified. MD identified Cys1899-Cys1903 disulfide as the most likely to undergo reduction based on energy and proximity criteria. Further MD suggested this reduction led to a more open conformation. Here we present our findings and highlight the value of MD approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4210332025,"In the research on energy-efficient networking methods for precision agriculture, a hot topic is the energy issue of sensing nodes for individual wireless sensor networks. The sensing nodes of the wireless sensor network should be enabled to provide better services with limited energy to support wide-range and multi-scenario acquisition and transmission of three-dimensional crop information. Further, the life cycle of the sensing nodes should be maximized under limited energy. The transmission direction and node power consumption are considered, and the forward and high-energy nodes are selected as the preferred cluster heads or data-forwarding nodes. Taking the cropland cultivation of ginseng as the background, we put forward a particle swarm optimization-based networking algorithm for wireless sensor networks with excellent performance. This algorithm can be used for precision agriculture and achieve optimal equipment configuration in a network under limited energy, while ensuring reliable communication in the network. The node scale is configured as 50 to 300 nodes in the range of 500 × 500 m2, and simulated testing is conducted with the LEACH, BCDCP, and ECHERP routing protocols. Compared with the existing LEACH, BCDCP, and ECHERP routing protocols, the proposed networking method can achieve the network lifetime prolongation and mitigate the decreased degree and decreasing trend of the distance between the sensing nodes and center nodes of the sensor network, which results in a longer network life cycle and stronger environment suitability. It is an effective method that improves the sensing node lifetime for a wireless sensor network applied to cropland cultivation of ginseng."
https://openalex.org/W4210542330,"miRNAs are short noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by inhibiting translation or inducing degradation of target mRNAs. miRNAs are often expressed as polycistronic transcripts, so-called miRNA clusters, containing several miRNA precursors. The largest mammalian miRNA cluster, the miR-379-410 cluster, is expressed primarily during embryonic development and in the adult brain; however, downstream regulation of this cluster is not well understood. Here, we investigated adenosine deamination to inosine (RNA editing) in the miR-379-410 cluster by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes as a possible mechanism modulating the expression and activity of these miRNAs in a brain-specific manner. We show that the levels of editing in the majority of mature miRNAs are lower than the editing levels of the corresponding site in primary miRNA precursors. However, for one miRNA, miR-376b-3p, editing was significantly higher in the mature form than in the primary precursor. We found miR-376b-3p maturation is negatively regulated by ADAR2 in an editing activity-independent manner, whereas ADAR1-mediated and ADAR2-mediated editing were observed to be competitive. In addition, the edited miR-376b-3p targets a different set of mRNAs than unedited miR-376b-3p, including 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, encoding the enzyme responsible for the catabolism of the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). Expression of edited miR-376b-3p led to increased intracellular GABA levels as well as increased cell surface presentation of GABA type A receptors. Our results indicate that both editing and editing-independent effects modulate the expression of miR-376b-3p, with the potential to regulate GABAergic signaling in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W4210736935,"Early recognition of the clinical signs of bloodstream infection in pediatric burn patients is key to improving survival rates in the burn unit. The objective of this study was to propose a simple scoring criteria that used readily available temperature, heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) data to accurately predict bloodstream infection in pediatric burn patients. A retrospective chart review included 100 patients admitted to the pediatric burn unit for >20% total body surface area (TBSA) burn injuries. Each patient had multiple blood culture tests, and each test was treated as a separate and independent ""infection event"" for analysis. The time at each blood culture draw was time 0 for that event, and temperature, HR and MAP data was collected for 24 hours after the blood culture was drawn. ""Infection events"" included in this study had at least six complete sets of temperature, HR and MAP data entries. Median temperature, HR and MAP, as well as mean fever spikes, HR spikes and MAP dips, were compared between infection group (positive blood cultures) and control group (negative blood cultures). These vital sign fluctuations were evaluated individually and as a combination of all three as timely predictors of bloodstream infection. In addition, we tested the prediction of Gram-negative bacteria versus Gram-positive or fungi present in blood cultures. Patients in the infection group had significantly higher median temperatures (p<0.001), mean fever spikes (p<0.001) and mean HR spikes (p<0.001), compared to the control group. Using the combination scoring criteria to predict bloodstream infection, the strongest predictive values in the 24-hour timeframe had high sensitivity (93%) and specificity (81%). The predictive test metric based on vital sign spikes predicted Gram-negative bacteria, but with limited sensitivity (57%) and specificity (44%). A simple scoring criteria using a combination of fever spikes, HR spikes and MAP dips predicted bloodstream infection in pediatric burn patients, and can be feasibly implemented in routine clinical care. There is also potential to use the predictive metric to detect a few select organisms based on vital signs, however further work is necessary to enhance accuracy to levels that would allow consideration for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W4210771225,"Introduction Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women in Malawi. Low awareness of cervical cancer and negative perceptions of screening can prevent women from participating in preventative strategies. We sought to explore perceptions and motivations for screening among women who participated in a cervical cancer screen-and-treat pilot study in rural Malawi. Materials and methods We conducted a qualitative sub-study of a community-based cervical cancer screen-and-treat pilot study in rural Lilongwe between July-August 2017. From October 2017-February 2018, 17 women who underwent screening using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and same-day thermal ablation treatment were recruited at their 12-week follow-up visit post treatment to participate in this qualitative sub-study. Semi-structured interview guides that explored baseline knowledge of cervical cancer, perceptions, and motivation for screening were used for in-depth interviews (IDIs). IDIs were conducted in the local language, Chichewa, translated and transcribed to English. Data was analyzed using NVivo ® V12.0. Results Findings included fatalistic views on cancer, but limited knowledge specific to cervical cancer. Misconceptions of cervical cancer screening were common; however, there was a unique understanding of screening as prevention (i.e., finding and treating early disease to prevent progression to worsening disease). This understanding appeared to stem from HIV prevention concepts known to the community. Motivations for screening included desire to know one’s health status, convenience of community-based screening, and peer encouragement. Conclusion Despite limited knowledge of cervical cancer and misconceptions of screening, the concept of screening for prevention, desire to know one’s health status, convenient access, and peers’ influence were motivators for participation in screening. Cervical cancer screen-and-treat programs in high HIV prevalence areas should consider utilizing language that parallels HIV prevention language to communicate the need for cervical cancer screening and treatment and utilize prevention concepts that may already be familiar to women living there."
https://openalex.org/W4210774515,"Background Increased physical activity levels and their determinations are essential issues worldwide. The Longitudinal Study of Physical Activity Determinants (ELDAF) aims to understand the roles of psychosocial and environmental factors in workers’ physical activity levels. Methods A prospective cohort study of non-faculty civil servants from a public university (approximately 1,200 individuals) will start in 2022 (baseline). The primary measurements will be accelerometer- and questionnaire-based physical activity, social support, social network, socioeconomic status, bereavement, job stress, body image, common mental disorders, depression, and neighborhood satisfaction. Additional measurements will include necessary sociodemographic, physical morbidity, lifestyle and anthropometric information. Participants’ places of residence will be geocoded using complete addresses. All participants will furnish written, informed consent before the beginning of the study. Pilot studies were performed to identify and correct potential problems in the data collection instruments and procedures. ELDAF will be the first cohort study conducted in Latin America to investigate physical activity and its determinants."
https://openalex.org/W4225472042,"The ascomycete, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum , has a broad host range and causes yield loss in dicotyledonous crops world wide. Genomic diversity was determined in a population of 127 isolates obtained from individual canola ( Brassica napus ) fields in western Canada. Genotyping with 39 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers revealed each isolate was a unique haplotype. Analysis of molecular variance showed 97% was due to isolate and 3% due to geographical location. Testing of mycelium compatibility among 133 isolates identified clones of mutually compatible isolates with 86–95% similar SSR haplotype, whereas incompatible isolates were highly diverse. In the Province of Manitoba, 61% of isolates were compatible forming clones and stings of pairwise compatible isolates not described before. In contrast, only 35% of isolates were compatible in Alberta without forming clones and strings, while 39% were compatible in Saskatchewan with a single clone, but no strings. These difference can be explained by wetter growing seasons and more susceptible crop species in Manitoba favouring frequent mycelium interaction and more life cycles over time, which might also explain similar differences observed in other geographical areas and host crops. Analysis of linkage disequilibrium rejected random recombination, consistent with a self-fertile fungus, restricted outcrossing due to mycelium incompatibility, and only a single annual opportunity for genomic recombination during meiosis in the ascospore stage between non-sister chromatids in the rare event nuclei from different isolates come together. More probable sources of genomic diversity is slippage during DNA replication and point mutation affecting single nucleotides that accumulate and likely increase mycelium incompatibility in a population over time. A phylogenetic tree based on SSR haplotype grouped isolates into 17 sub-populations. Aggressiveness was tested by inoculating one isolate from each sub-population onto B . napus lines with quantitative resistance. Analysis of variance was significant for isolate, line, and isolate by line interaction. These isolates represent the genomic and pathogenic diversity in western Canada, and are suitable for resistance screening in canola breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W4210478493,"Oxidized phospholipids have been shown to exhibit pleiotropic effects in numerous biological contexts. For example, 1-O-hexadecyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (azPC), an oxidized phospholipid formed from alkyl phosphatidylcholines, is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) nuclear receptor agonist. Although it has been reported that PPARγ agonists including thiazolidinediones can induce plasma volume expansion by enhancing renal sodium and water retention, the role of azPC in renal transport functions is unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effect of azPC on renal proximal tubule (PT) transport using isolated PTs and kidney cortex tissues and also investigated the effect of azPC on renal sodium handling in vivo. We showed using a microperfusion technique that azPC rapidly stimulated Na+/HCO3- cotransporter 1 (NBCe1) and luminal Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) activities in a dose-dependent manner at submicromolar concentrations in isolated PTs from rats and humans. The rapid effects (within a few minutes) suggest that azPC activates NBCe1 and NHE via nongenomic signaling. The stimulatory effects were completely blocked by specific PPARγ antagonist GW9662, ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059, and CD36 inhibitor sulfosuccinimidyl oleate. Treatment with an siRNA against PPAR gamma completely blocked the stimulation of both NBCe1 and NHE by azPC. Moreover, azPC induced ERK phosphorylation in rat and human kidney cortex tissues, which were completely suppressed by GW9662 and PD98059 treatments. These results suggest that azPC stimulates renal PT sodium-coupled bicarbonate transport via a CD36/PPARγ/mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase/ERK pathway. We conclude that the stimulatory effects of azPC on PT transport may be partially involved in volume expansion."
https://openalex.org/W4210561803,"The cell orientation characteristics of the natural combs of honey bees have received much research attention. Although natural combs have been shown to be composed of cells with three orientations-vertical, intermediate (oblique), and horizontal-the proportion of comb cells in these three orientations varies. Knowledge of the comb-building preferences of honey bees is essential for the installation of wax comb foundations, and clarification of the cell orientation characteristics of natural honey bee combs is important for beekeeping. The purpose of this study was to determine the cell orientation characteristics of natural combs of Eastern honey bees (Apis cerana cerana) and Western honey bees (Apis mellifera ligustica). Newly built combs were used to measure the orientation of hexagonal cells and calculate the proportion of cells in different orientations relative to the total number of cells. The number of eggs laid by queens in the cells of different orientations was also determined. The orientation of cells in the natural combs of Eastern and Western honey bees was determined based on the value of the minimum included angle between the pair of parallel cell walls and a vertical line connecting the top and bottom bars of the movable frame in the geometric plane of the comb: 0°≤θ≤10°, 10°<θ≤20°, and 20°<θ≤30° for vertical, intermediate, and horizontal orientations, respectively. Natural combs were composed of cells with at least one orientation (vertical or horizontal), two orientations (vertical + intermediate (oblique) or vertical + horizontal), or three orientations (vertical + intermediate + horizontal), and the proportions of combs with the three aforementioned configurations differed. Both Eastern honey bees and Western honey bees preferred building combs with cells in a vertical orientation. Queens showed no clear preference for laying eggs in cells of specific orientations. The results of this study provide new insight that could aid the production and cutting of wax comb foundations of Eastern and Western honey bees. Our study highlights the importance of installing wax comb foundations compatible with the comb-building preferences of bees."
https://openalex.org/W4210698256,"Shared medical appointments (SMAs) offer a means for providing knowledge and skills needed for chronic disease management to patients. However, SMAs require a time and attention investment from health care providers, who must understand the goals and potential benefits of SMAs from the perspective of patients and providers. To better understand how to gain provider engagement and inform future SMA implementation, qualitative inquiry of provider experience based on a knowledge-attitude-practice model was explored. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 health care providers leading SMAs for heart failure at three Veterans Administration Medical Centers. Rapid matrix analysis process techniques including team-based qualitative inquiry followed by stakeholder validation was employed. The interview guide followed a knowledge-attitude-practice model with a priori domains of knowledge of SMA structure and content (understanding of how SMAs were structured), SMA attitude/beliefs (general expectations about SMA use), attitudes regarding how leading SMAs affected patients, and providers. Data regarding the patient referral process (organizational processes for referring patients to SMAs) and suggested improvements were collected to further inform the development of SMA implementation best practices. Providers from all three sites reported similar knowledge, attitude and beliefs of SMAs. In general, providers reported that the multi-disciplinary structure of SMAs was an effective strategy towards improving clinical outcomes for patients. Emergent themes regarding experiences with SMAs included improved self-efficacy gained from real-time collaboration with providers from multiple disciplines, perceived decrease in patient re-hospitalizations, and promotion of self-management skills for patients with HF. Most providers reported that the SMA-setting facilitated patient learning by providing opportunities for the sharing of experiences and knowledge. This was associated with the perception of increased comradery and support among patients. Future research is needed to test suggested improvements and to develop best practices for training additional sites to implement HF SMA."
https://openalex.org/W4210739993,"Biocapacity of a region exhibits spatial differences owing to the limitations of regional scale and natural conditions. Based on the multi-scale perspective, we comprehensively studied and analyzed the temporal and spatial differences of the biocapacity of a region in an attempt to establish the groundwork for optimizing urban development and its utilization framework. By adopting the ecological footprint model along with multi-scale difference evaluation method, the municipal and county scales are incorporated into a unified analysis framework in this paper, thereby facilitating the exploration of the temporal and spatial differences in the biocapacity of Shenyang-a city in China-from 2005 to 2019. The results demonstrated that: 1) At the municipal scale, the biocapacity per capita fluctuated between 1.35 hm2/person and 2.22 hm2/person. It revealed an ""up-down-up"" trend, which appeared consistent with the Kuznets cycle; at the county scale, the biocapacity depicted spatial differences, while those of downtown and surrounding districts/counties developed a two-level ascending hierarchical structure. 2) The time series of footprint size and depth first ascended and then declined, and can be classified into four types: closed type, inverted U-type, S-type, and M-type. Among them, S-type and M-type have the phenomenon of over-utilizing the stock capital. 3) For a long time, the regional difference of biocapacity has mostly dwelt on two scales with an evident scale effect, and the biocapacity of Liaozhong District was the worst."
https://openalex.org/W4210799598,"To date all public records of F. carica SSR profiles are from NCGR Davis. Prior studies of this data have not been received well because several of the stated relationships do not match what is observed in the field. Upon examination of the prior authors methods it is found that the 1979 Nei similarity measures are not valid distance metrics for the profiles thus invalidating their analysis of genetic distance. Further, the data are tensor in nature and it is shown here that ""flattening the data"" for use in a vector method will change the problem under study. Consequently the present analysis focuses on geometric, statistical, and biostatistical tensor-based methods-finding that only the latter produces results matching what is manually observed among the profiles. Combining this with historical breeding records and morphologic observations reveals that a modest portion of the profiled accessions are mislabeled-and also reveals the existence of previously undocumented close relations. Another area of concern in the prior studies is the statistical partitioning of the complete graph of distances to define clades. In the present analysis it is shown that genetic clades cannot be defined in this profile collection due to lack of cohesion in nearest neighbor components. It is also shown that it is presently intractable to significantly rectify gaps in the sample population by profile enrichment because the number of individuals in an entire population within the estimated profile distribution exceeds 1014. The profiles themselves are found to have very few occurrences of common values between the 15 loci and thus according to Fisher's theory of epistatic variance no correlation to phenotype attributes is expected-a result verified by the original investigators. Therefore further discovery of appropriate markers is needed to fully capture geno- and pheno-type characteristics in F. carica and F. palmata SSR profiles."
