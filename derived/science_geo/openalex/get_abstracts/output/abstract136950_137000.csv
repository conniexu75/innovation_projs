https://openalex.org/W2148927531,"A device was developed that uses microfabricated fluidic channels, heaters, temperature sensors, and fluorescence detectors to analyze nanoliter-size DNA samples. The device is capable of measuring aqueous reagent and DNA-containing solutions, mixing the solutions together, amplifying or digesting the DNA to form discrete products, and separating and detecting those products. No external lenses, heaters, or mechanical pumps are necessary for complete sample processing and analysis. Because all of the components are made using conventional photolithographic production techniques, they operate as a single closed system. The components have the potential for assembly into complex, low-power, integrated analysis systems at low unit cost. The availability of portable, reliable instruments may facilitate the use of DNA analysis in applications such as rapid medical diagnostics and point-of-use agricultural testing."
https://openalex.org/W2104474860,"After nearly a century of recovery from overhunting, sea otter populations are in abrupt decline over large areas of western Alaska. Increased killer whale predation is the likely cause of these declines. Elevated sea urchin density and the consequent deforestation of kelp beds in the nearshore community demonstrate that the otter's keystone role has been reduced or eliminated. This chain of interactions was probably initiated by anthropogenic changes in the offshore oceanic ecosystem."

APP can undergo endoproteolytic processing at three sites, one at the amino terminus of the Aβ domain (β-cleavage), one within the Aβ domain (α-cleavage), and one at the carboxyl terminus of the Aβ domain (γ-cleavage). The enzymes responsible for these activities have not been unambiguously identified. By the use of gene disruption (knockout), we now demonstrate that TACE (tumor necrosis factor α converting enzyme), a member of the ADAM family (adisintegrinand metalloprotease-family) of proteases, plays a central role in regulated α-cleavage of APP. Our data suggest that TACE may be the α-secretase responsible for the majority of regulated α-cleavage in cultured cells.

This secreted APP (APPs) is a major APP-related species found in cerebrospinal fluid and brain homogenates (8Palmert M.R. Podlisny M.B. Witker D.S. Oltersdorf T. Younkin L.H. Selkoe D.J. Younkin S.G.

In most cells in culture, activating protein kinase C causes the majority (80–95%) of the APP to undergo α-cleavage (“regulated” α-cleavage). Stimulation of APPs formation and secretion by activating second messenger cascades is not due to the phosphorylation of APP (15da Cruz e Silva O.A. Iverfeldt K. Oltersdorf T. Sinha S. Lieberburg I.

Regulated cleavage of APP appears to occurin vivo under conditions in which protein kinase C is activated.

The potential importance of the regulated cleavage pathway of APP makes it worthwhile to identify the enzyme(s) involved in this pathway. Membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), like APP, is a transmembrane protein that can undergo proteolysis to release the extracellular domain as soluble TNF-α. The generation of soluble TNF-α from membrane-bound TNF-α involves an enzyme activity denoted TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) (28Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L.

Cells stably expressing APP were the gift of Dr. E. H. Koo. Antibodies 22C11 and 6E10 were purchased from commercial sources. Immunoblotting and metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation were carried out as described previously (18Buxbaum J.D. Koo E.H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine whether TACE could cleave an APP peptide encompassing the α-cleavage site, acetyl-VHHQKLVFFA-amide (0.5 mm) was incubated with buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) or 7 μm catalytic domain of TACE (35Maskos K.

The exact composition of the digests was determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), using a 1-mm inside diameter Vydac C18 column with a flow rate of 50 μl/min and a linear gradient of 2% acetonitrile/min in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. MS was carried out by directing 10% of the HPLC effluent to the electrospray source of a Finnigan TSQ700 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA). As a direct and definitive test for an involvement of TACE in the α-secretase pathway, we examined basal and regulated APP secretion in primary embryonic fibroblasts derived from control mice or mice in which the TACE gene had been disrupted by homologous recombination (knockouts) (28Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In cells derived from control mice, regulated secretion was stimulated 300–500% by activation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Inhibition of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A by okadaic acid had similar effects (not shown). These effects were blocked by IC3. In contrast, in cells derived from knockout mice, there was no increase in the formation and secretion of APPscaused by the addition of PMA (Fig. 1) or okadaic acid (not shown). The levels of cell-associated, full-length APP were identical in the two cell populations, indicating that TACE knockout cells are not deficient in expressing APP (not shown). As an additional control, basal and PMA-activated protein kinase C activities were determined and were identical between the cell populations (not shown). The nearly total lack of PMA- and okadaic acid-induced cleavage and secretion of APP indicates that TACE (or a substrate of TACE) is the predominant α-secretase for regulated secretion in this system. Note that basal formation and secretion of APPs was unaffected in cells derived from knockout mice supporting the existence of two classes of secretases. To begin to distinguish whether it is TACE itself that acts on APP or whether TACE acts via an intermediary, we tested whether recombinant TACE catalytic domain (35Maskos K. Fernandez-Catalan C. Huber R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Ellestad G.A. Reddy P. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Castner B.J. Davis R. Clarke H.R. Petersen M. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. March C.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Bode W.

TACE was able to cleave the synthetic peptide between Lys and Leu, at the APP α-secretase site (37Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T. McClure D. Ward P.J.

Sambamurti K. Lieberburg I. Robakis N.K. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 128: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), indicating that TACE has the potential to appropriately cleave APP. It should be noted that the α-secretase activity responsible for basal secretion of APP (which may not be TACE, see Fig. 1) acts at a site largely, but not completely, determined by the distance of the site from the membrane (40Maruyama K. Kametani F. Usami M. Yamao-Harigaya W. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1670-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 41Sisodia S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The amino acid requirements for substrate cleavage by TACE have not been fully determined although it is clear that TACE functions most effectively when it and its substrate are appropriately oriented in the membrane. In addition to their effects on the formation and secretion of APPs, second messenger cascades are also able to regulate the formation and secretion of Aβ. For example, activation of protein kinase C and/or inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 leads to increased formation and secretion of APPs together with a decrease in the formation and secretion of Aβ (18Buxbaum J.D. Koo E.H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9195-9198Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 19Gabuzda D. Busciglio J. Yankner B.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2326-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Hung A.Y. Haass C. Nitsch R.M. Qiu W.Q. Citron M. Wurtman R.J. Growdon J.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22959-22962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the effects of these compounds are due to limiting amounts of substrate (APP) (7Buxbaum J.D. Ruefli A.A. Parker C.A. Cypess A.M. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4489-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Buxbaum J.D. Koo E.H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9195-9198Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), such that by stimulating the formation and secretion of APPs there is per force less Aβ formed. To test this hypothesis, cells stably expressing APP751 were metabolically (pulse-chase) labeled and examined for effects of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and/or IC3 on APPs and Aβ formation and secretion, as determined by quantitative immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3). Importantly, the effects of PDBu on Aβ formation were completely blocked by IC3. This paralleled the effects of IC3 on regulated secretion of APPs, consistent with the hypothesis detailed above. Interestingly, not only were the effects of PDBu on Aβ formation blocked by IC3 but there was a significant increase in Aβ formation in the presence of PDBu and IC3. This indicates that there is a heretofore masked pathway in which activation of protein kinase C can lead to increased formation and secretion of Aβ. As a final point, the antibodies used for immunoprecipitation of APPs (6E10) recognize the portion of APP between the β- and α-cleavage sites. Thus, it is the α-secretase-derived species of APPs that is formed in the presence of PDBu and blocked by IC3. Similar results were observed with cells expressing mutant (NL) APP or when PMA (1 μm) was used in place of PDBu (not shown). In this study, we have examined the role of TACE in regulated α-secretion. Pharmacological manipulation of TACE leads to altered α-cleavage of APP and altered Aβ formation. More importantly, disruption of the TACE gene completely abolishes regulated α-cleavage in cultured cells. This result is consistent with TACE being an α-secretase, a premise further supported by the ability of TACE to cleave the APP synthetic peptide at the appropriate site. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that TACE is acting on a separate protein which then affects APP cleavage. It is important to note that basal formation and secretion of APPs was unaffected in cells derived from knockout mice. This supports the existence of two classes of secretases, one involved in basal secretion and one (perhaps TACE) involved in regulated secretion. Note, however, that in cultured CHO cells some basal secretion seems to be inhibited by IC3. Finally, by the use of IC3, we provide additional evidence that the effects of protein kinase C activation on Aβ formation are secondary to effects on the formation and secretion of APPs and identify a novel effect of protein kinase C on increasing Aβ formation under restricted conditions. Alterations in TACE activity during aging may contribute to amyloid formation. In addition, activating TACE by pharmacological manipulation might prove beneficial in Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, homologs of TACE might be involved in basal secretion of APPs and in β-cleavage of APP. A distinct molecular mechanism for α-secretase, involving GPI-linked aspartyl proteases, has been identified recently in yeast (Komano, H., Seeger, M., Gandy, S., Wang, G. T., Krafft, G. A., and Fuller, R. S. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, in press)."
https://openalex.org/W2015954946,"Essential to the dendritic cell system of antigen-presenting cells are the veiled dendritic cells that traverse afferent lymph to enter lymph nodes, where they initiate immune responses. The origin of veiled cells, which were discovered 20 years ago, is unclear. Monocytes cultured with endothelium differentiated into dendritic cells within 2 days, particularly after phagocytosing particles in subendothelial collagen. These nascent dendritic cells migrated across the endothelium in the ablumenal-to-lumenal direction, as would occur during entry into lymphatics. Monocytes that remained in the subendothelial matrix became macrophages. Therefore, monocytes have two potential fates associated with distinct patterns of migration."

Here it is shown that transgenic overexpression of angiopoietin-1 in the skin of mice produces larger, more numerous, and more highly branched vessels. These results raise the possibility that angiopoietins can be used, alone or in combination with VEGF, to promote therapeutic angiogenesis."

Consequently, the detection sensitivity of analytes in micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) can be improved significantly. For example, 9 to 18 parts per billion of an environmentally important racemic herbicide spiked in lake water was separated by MEKC and detected by ultraviolet absorption."

Purified 13S condensin introduces positive supercoils into DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I and adenosine triphosphate in vitro. The supercoiling activity of 13Scondensin was regulated by mitosis-specific phosphorylation. Immunodepletion, in vitro phosphorylation, and peptide-mapping experiments indicated that Cdc2 is likely to be the kinase that phosphorylates and activates 13S condensin. Multiple Cdc2 phosphorylation sites are clustered in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the XCAP-D2 (Xenopus chromosome-associated polypeptide D2) subunit. These results suggest that phosphorylation of 13Scondensin by Cdc2 may trigger mitotic chromosome condensation in vitro."

Here it is shown that most survivors have circularized all of their chromosomes, whereas a smaller number maintain their telomeres presumably through recombination. When the telomeric DNA-binding gene taz1+ is also deleted, trt1- taz1- survivors use the recombinational mode more frequently. Moreover, the massive elongation of telomeres in taz1- cells is absent in the double mutant. Thus, Taz1p appears to regulate telomeric recombination as well as telomerase activity in fission yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1979770710,"Amino acids have been identified as important signaling molecules involved in pancreatic β-cell proliferation, although the cellular mechanism responsible for this effect is not well defined. We previously reported that amino acids are required for glucose or exogenous insulin to stimulate phosphorylation of PHAS-I (phosphorylated heat- and acid-stable protein regulated by insulin), a recently discovered regulator of translation initiation during cell mitogenesis. Here we demonstrate that essential amino acids, in particular branched-chain amino acids (leucine, valine, and isoleucine), are largely responsible for mediating this effect. The transamination product of leucine, α-ketoisocaproic acid, also stimulates PHAS-I phosphorylation although the transamination products of isoleucine and valine are ineffective. Since amino acids are secretagogues for insulin secretion by β-cells, we investigated whether endogenous insulin secreted by β-cells is involved. Interestingly, branched-chain amino acids stimulate phosphorylation of PHAS-I independent of endogenous insulin secretion since genistein (10 μm) and herbimycin A (1 μm), two tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the insulin signaling pathway, exert no effect on amino acid-induced phosphorylation of PHAS-I. Furthermore, branched-chain amino acids retain their ability to induce phosphorylation of PHAS-I under conditions that block insulin secretion from β-cells. In exploring the signaling pathway responsible for these effects, we find that rapamycin (25 nm) inhibits the ability of branched-chain amino acids to stimulate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I and p70s6 kinase, suggesting that the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway is involved. The branched-chain amino acid, leucine, also exerts similar effects on PHAS-I phosphorylation in isolated pancreatic islets. In addition, we find that amino acids are necessary for insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) to stimulate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I indicating that a requirement for amino acids may be essential for other β-cell growth factors in addition to insulin and IGF-I to activate this signaling pathway. We propose that amino acids, in particular branched-chain amino acids, may promote β-cell proliferation either by stimulating phosphorylation of PHAS-I and p70s6k via the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and/or by facilitating the proliferative effect mediated by growth factors such as insulin and IGF-I. Amino acids have been identified as important signaling molecules involved in pancreatic β-cell proliferation, although the cellular mechanism responsible for this effect is not well defined. We previously reported that amino acids are required for glucose or exogenous insulin to stimulate phosphorylation of PHAS-I (phosphorylated heat- and acid-stable protein regulated by insulin), a recently discovered regulator of translation initiation during cell mitogenesis.

Nutrients, in particular, amino acids have been recognized as important signaling mediators in pancreatic β-cell function. In addition to modulating insulin secretion by β-cells and glucagon secretion by α-cells, amino acids have been identified as important signaling agents in the initiation and modulation of β-cell proliferation. Previous studies by Swenne (1Swenne I. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2Swenne I. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 803-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that increases in essential amino acids significantly enhance [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by pancreatic islets. Although amino acids alone and in combination with insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I),1 and other growth factors are well documented to exert a mitogenic effect on both adult and fetal islets, the cellular mechanism responsible for this effect is not well defined. Insulin and other growth factors induce increases in protein synthesis, in part, by stimulating mRNA translation. The regulation of protein synthesis is believed to be central to cell replication since re-entry of cells into the cell cycle in response to growth factors and nutrients is accompanied by an approximate doubling of protein synthesis before the onset of DNA synthesis and cell division (3Morley S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 4Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This obligatory role for an increase in the rate of protein synthesis for cells to enter and progress through the cell cycle has suggested that activation of protein translation is an important initial event in the mitogenic response. The initiation phase of mRNA translation is generally rate-limiting for protein synthesis (see Refs. 3Morley S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 4Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem.

Cell Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar for reviews). Initiation is mediated in part by the eIF-4F complex, which is composed of three subunits, eIF-4γ, eIF-4A, and eIF-4E (6Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). eIF-4γ is a large subunit (M r = 220,000) that binds eIF-4A (M r = 45,000) and eIF-4E (M r = 25,000). eIF-4A is an ATP-dependent helicase, and eIF-4E is the mRNA cap-binding protein. The initiation factor, eIF-4E, is the least abundant of the eIF-4F subunits, and it is generally believed that the amount of eIF-4E is limiting for translation initiation. eIF-4E is involved in recognition of the mRNA cap, a structure of m7GpppN (N represents any nucleotide) located at the 5'-end of almost all eukaryotic messages. The availability of eIF-4E is regulated by PHAS-I (also designated as 4E-BP1), a heat- and acid-stable eIF-4E-binding protein first identified in rat adipocytes (7Lin T-A. Kong X Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 8Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A-C. Donze O. Lin T-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). PHAS-I inhibits the binding of eIF-4E to eIF-4G (also designated as eIF-4γ), thus preventing formation of a complex necessary for efficient binding and proper positioning of the 40 S ribosomal subunit of mRNA. When phosphorylated in the appropriate sites after exposure of responsive cells to insulin, PHAS-I dissociates from eIF-4E, thus allowing eIF-4E to participate in translation initiation. Recent studies have implicated a signaling pathway involving the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as an upstream regulator of PHAS-I phosphorylation. Rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressant and antiproliferative agent that mediates its effects through formation of an active complex with its intracellular receptor, FK506-binding protein of M r = 12,000 (9Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). This rapamycin complex then binds to members of the TOR (target of rapamycin) family which include TOR1p and TOR2p in yeast and a mammalian homologue, mTOR, also designated as FRAP or RAFT1 (10Zheng X-F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3070-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q-P. Kasuga M.

In yeast and mammalian cells, activation of TOR is required for G1 progression and cell proliferation (12Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that mTOR directly phosphorylates PHAS-I, although how mTOR is regulated is not yet defined (13Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J.

A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). In insulin-sensitive cells, activation of the insulin receptor is believed to result in phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) which then activates phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase (16Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). New evidence supports the conclusion that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation and activation of mTOR is mediated by the protein kinase B signaling pathway (17Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). PHAS-I and p70s6k are located downstream in this pathway and are proposed to be regulated by mTOR in a parallel manner (11Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q-P. Kasuga M. Nishimoto I. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26457-26463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 18Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway can be blocked by inhibiting PI 3-kinase with wortmannin, although higher concentrations of wortmannin also inhibit mTOR. Phosphorylation and activation of p70s6kmediates ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation and may be essential during the G1 phase of the cell cycle (18Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M.

Sonenberg N. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Overall, these studies suggest that PHAS-I and p70s6k exert important roles in growth-regulated protein translation in a variety of cells. Our studies have recently shown that incubation of pancreatic islets with elevated glucose levels results in rapid and concentration-dependent phosphorylation of PHAS-I (20Xu G. Marshall C.A. Lin T-A. Kwon G. Munivenkatappa R.B. Hill J.R. Lawrence Jr., J.C. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This effect is due, in part, to insulin released into the incubation medium, since exogenous insulin increases whereas conditions that block insulin exocytosis from the β-cell inhibit phosphorylation of PHAS-I. In addition, conditions that stimulate insulin secretion from the β-cell lines, βTC6-F7 and βTC3, increase phosphorylation of PHAS-I, suggesting that β-cells of the islet, in part, mediate this effect. These findings indicate that glucose stimulates PHAS-I phosphorylation via insulin interacting with its own receptor on the β-cell which may serve as an important mechanism for autoregulation of protein synthesis by translation. During the course of these studies, we discovered that amino acids are required for glucose or exogenous insulin to stimulate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I. Furthermore, amino acids alone dose-dependently stimulate phosphorylation of PHAS-I in a rapamycin-sensitive manner which is further enhanced by insulin. We have therefore examined in the present study the signal transduction pathways whereby amino acids, in particular branched-chain amino acids, alone and in synergy with insulin and other growth factors activate the mTOR signaling pathway. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Collagenase type P was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. CMRL-1066 and RPMI 1640 tissue culture media, penicillin, streptomycin, Hanks' balanced salt solution, l-glutamine, MEM amino acids solution, and MEM non-essential amino acids solution were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was from HyClone (Logan, UT). Rapamycin was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Ficoll was from Sigma. PHAS-I antibody was generated in rabbit with recombinant His-tagged rat PHAS-I (7Lin T-A. Kong X Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The antibody for p70s6k was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals were from commercially available sources. Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRBB: 25 mm HEPES, 115 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) was supplemented with MEM amino acids solution, MEM non-essential amino acids solution, and l-glutamine. For these experiments, the 1× concentration of amino acids was defined as the following in mm: l-arginine 0.73, l-cystine 0.2,l-glutamine 2.0,l-histidine·HCl·H2O 0.2,l-isoleucine 0.4, l-leucine 0.4,l-lysine HCl 0.5, l-methionine 0.1,l-phenylalanine 0.2, l-threonine 0.4,l-tryptophan 0.05, l-tyrosine 0.2,l-valine 0.4, l-alanine 0.1,l-asparagine 0.1, l-aspartic acid 0.1,l-glutamic acid 0.1, glycine 0.1, l-proline 0.1, l-serine 0.1. The osmolarity of each solution was measured using a Wescor Vapor Pressure Osmometer (Logan, UT) and found to be between 300 and 310 mOsm/kg. RINm5F cells, an insulin-secreting β-cell line (21Gazdar A.F. Chick W.L. Oie H.K. Sims H.L. King D.L. Weir G.C. Lauris V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Diabetes. 1982; 31: 521-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured by the Washington University Tissue Culture Support Center in RPMI 1640 containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 16.8 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were subcultured in “complete” CMRL-1066 tissue culture medium (cCMRL) containing 5.5 mmglucose, 2 mml-glutamine, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in Petri dishes (60 × 15 mm) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/3 ml and incubated at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 for 24 h before initiating experiments. Where “CMRL” is stated, this culture media does not contain fetal bovine serum. Islets were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by collagenase digestion as described previously (23McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, pancreata were inflated with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and the tissue was isolated, minced, and digested with 7 mg of collagenase/pancreas for 7 min at 39 °C. Islets were separated on a Ficoll step density gradient and then selected with a stereomicroscope to exclude any contaminating tissues. Islets were cultured overnight in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in cCMRL. To achieve a quiescent state, RINm5F cells (1 × 106 cells/3 ml) or islets (200/1 ml) were washed free of culture media and fetal bovine serum and preincubated for 2 h at 24 or 37 °C in KRBB in the absence of glucose and amino acids. KRBB was replaced as described in the figure legends. Following experimental treatments, cells or islets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 300 or 30 μl, respectively, of Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants were processed for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting of PHAS-I or p70s6k as described previously (20Xu G. Marshall C.A. Lin T-A. Kwon G. Munivenkatappa R.B. Hill J.R. Lawrence Jr., J.C. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Detection was performed using ECL reagents from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. PHAS-I α, β, γ, and δ were quantitated by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer Scanning Instrument (Sunnyvale, CA). Data were expressed as percent of PHAS-I γ and δ, over total PHAS-I. Insulin in the culture media was assayed by the radioimmunoassay core facility of the Washington University Diabetes Research Training Center. Previous studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of PHAS-I, a necessary step for the release of the rate-limiting initiation factor, eIF-4E, results in a decrease in electrophoretic mobility of this protein when separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (24Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the hyperphosphorylated γ-form of PHAS-I migrates most slowly, followed by the intermediary β-form and the nonphosphorylated α-form of PHAS-I. Under some experimental conditions in the present studies, PHAS-Iδ is detected which represents a more hyperphosphorylated form of PHAS-I than PHAS-Iγ. Our recent studies demonstrated that a complete complement of amino acids normally present in tissue culture medium stimulated in a concentration-dependent manner phosphorylation of PHAS-I with a maximal effect observed at 1× amino acids (20Xu G. Marshall C.A. Lin T-A. Kwon G. Munivenkatappa R.B. Hill J.R. Lawrence Jr., J.C. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine which amino acids are responsible for this effect, RINm5F cells were treated with Krebs'-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRBB) supplemented with either a complete complement of amino acids (1×), essential amino acids (1×), non-essential amino acids (1×), or glutamine (1×) for 30 min following a 2-h preincubation in KRBB (amino acid- and glucose-free). As shown in Fig. 1, in the absence of amino acids (lane 1), only 28% of PHAS-I is phosphorylated to the level of γ. Essential amino acids (1×,lane 3) were as effective in mediating phosphorylation of PHAS-Iγ (69%) compared with a complete complement of amino acids (73%, lane 2). It is noted in Fig. 1 that the nonphosphorylated form of PHAS-I, PHAS-Iα, is not detected. PHAS-Iα does occur in RINm5F cells and intact islets, although occasionally it is not detected dependent on the degree of quiescence of the cells. Although non-essential amino acids (lane 4) and glutamine (lane 5) did cause some PHAS-Iγ phosphorylation, 30 and 40% respectively, the effect was not nearly as significant as that produced by either essential or a complete complement of amino acids. Therefore, our present studies have focused specifically in defining the role of essential amino acids in mitogenic signaling. Since essential amino acids consist of a mixture of 12 different amino acids, we determined next if single amino acids could mediate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I. To this end, RINm5F cells were exposed to KRBB containing each essential amino acid (10 mm) for 30 min following a 2-h preincubation in the absence of amino acids (KRBB). This concentration of amino acids is similar to the total complement of amino acids and also experimental conditions under which individual amino acids have been evaluated for effects on insulin secretion, amino acid transport, and metabolism by β-cells (25Hellman B. Sehlin J. Täljedal I-B. Endocrinol. 1971; 89: 1432-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Hellman B. Sehlin J. Täljedal I-B. Biochem.

As shown in Fig. 2 (lane 1), in the absence of amino acids 30% of PHAS-I was in the γ- and δ-form. A complete mixture of amino acids (1×, lane 2) resulted in 72% of PHAS-I to be in the γ- and δ-form. All 12 of the minimal essential amino acids caused some increase in the percent of PHAS-Iγ and -δ compared with the absence of amino acids. The branched-chain amino acids, leucine (Leu, 72%), isoleucine (Ile, 65%), and valine (Val, 77%) were among the most effective in stimulating formation of PHAS-Iγ and δ (lanes 3–5), compared with the absence of amino acids (lane 1) and a complete complement of amino acids (lane 2). It is noted that valine (10 mm) also results in a significant appearance of the hyperphosphorylated form of PHAS-I, PHAS-Iδ (lane 5). Of the remaining essential amino acids (methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, cystine, threonine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine, and lysine), only tyrosine (65%) was as effective as the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) to induce the formation of PHAS-Iγ (lanes 6–14). We therefore decided to limit the remainder of this study to the branched-chain amino acids, although these data do not negate a role for the other amino acids in the regulation of protein translation. To explore further the mechanism by which essential amino acids stimulate PHAS-I phosphorylation, the effects of branched-chain amino acids and their metabolites were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), leucine and its transamination product, α-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC), dose-dependently mediated the increased formation of PHAS-Iγ. Leucine at concentrations of 2 mm and greater resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of PHAS-I, whereas this same effect was observed at a 10-fold lower concentration for KIC. The effects of valine, isoleucine, and their metabolites, α-ketoisovalerate (KIV) and α-keto-β-methylvalerate (KMV), respectively, were also examined on PHAS-I phosphorylation. Although both valine and isoleucine dose-dependently induced PHAS-I phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and B), the transamination products of valine, KIV, and isoleucine, KMV, were ineffective in stimulating the phosphorylation of PHAS-I (Fig. 4 C, lanes 4 and 6). These latter findings suggest that unlike the metabolite of leucine, KIC, either the transport of KIV and KMV into β-cells is impaired and/or their metabolism is not sufficient to induce phosphorylation of PHAS-I.Figure 4Effect of valine, isoleucine, and their metabolites on PHAS-I phosphorylation in RINm5F cells. RINm5F cells were preincubated in KRBB in the absence of glucose and amino acids for 2 h. Following preincubation, buffer was replaced with KRBB containing valine (0.2–10 mm) (A), isoleucine (0.2–10 mm) (B), and KIV (10 mm) and KMV (10 mm) (C) for 30 min.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27871-27875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, branched-chain amino acids stimulated phosphorylation of PHAS-I (lane 3), in comparison to the absence of amino acids (lane 1) and a complete complement of amino acids (lane 2). This effect was not prevented by either genistein or herbimycin A (lanes 4 and 5). Similar results were obtained with genistein at concentrations of 1 and 100 μm (data not shown). Genistein and herbimycin A are effective tyrosine kinase inhibitors in islets and RINm5F cells. Previously we have shown that these inhibitors block interleukin-1-stimulated tyrosine kinase activation, resulting in the inhibition of NFκB translocation to the nucleus and blockade of subsequent transcription and translation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene by rat islets and RINm5F cells (30Corbett J. Kwon G.K. Misko T.P. Rodi C.P. McDaniel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C48-C54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kwon G. Corbett J.A. Rodi C.P. Sullivan P. McDaniel M.L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4790-4795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that branched-chain amino acids induce phosphorylation of PHAS-I independent of the upstream insulin signaling pathway by β-cells. To support further this possibility, RINm5F cells were incubated at 24 °C, a condition that blocks almost completely secretagogue-induced insulin exocytosis. Under conditions of reduced temperature, ion fluxes and metabolism of amino acids are minimally affected (32Escolar J.C. Hoo-Paris R. Castex C. Sutter B.C.J. J. Endocrinol. 1987; 115: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 33Renström E. Eliasson L. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 1996; 494: 41-52Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, blocking endogenous insulin secretion from β-cells by reducing the incubation temperature from 37 °C (lanes 1–3) to 24 °C (lanes 4–6) did not attenuate the ability of branched-chain amino acids to induce PHAS-Iγ formation (compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 2 and 3). In these studies (Fig. 5 B), insulin secretion levels in the absence of amino acids were 3.2 ± 0.1 nm at 37 °C (lane 1) and 2.1 ± 0.2 nm at 24 °C (lane 4). At a concentration of 1× amino acids, insulin levels were 6.1 ± 0.9 nm at 37 °C (lane 2) and 2.4 ± 0.7 nm at 24 °C (lane 5). Insulin secretion levels with branched-chain amino acids (10 mm) were 8.6 ± 2.2 nm at 37 °C (lane 3) and 2.5 ± 0.3 nm at 24 °C (lane 6). These results suggest that endogenous insulin secretion exerted no effect on amino acid-induced phosphorylation of PHAS-I. Taken together, these findings support the concept that phosphorylation of PHAS-I stimulated by amino acids is independent of endogenous insulin secretion by β-cells. Although several studies suggest that PHAS-I is phosphorylated in cell-free preparations by a variety of kinases such as casein kinase II, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (24Haystead T.A.J.

To study the composition and function of these molecules when derived from anin vivo source, soluble proteoglycans released into human wound fluid were characterized and evaluated for influence on fibroblast growth factor-2 activity. Immunoblot analysis of wound fluid revealed the presence of syndecan-1, syndecan-4, glypican, decorin, perlecan, and versican. Sulfated glycosaminoglycan concentrations ranged from 15 to 65 μg/ml, and treatment with chondroitinase B showed that a large proportion of the glycosaminoglycan was dermatan sulfate. The total glycosaminoglycan mixture present in wound fluid supported the ability of fibroblast growth factor-2 to signal cell proliferation. Dermatan sulfate, and not heparan sulfate, was the major contributor to this activity, and dermatan sulfate bound FGF-2 withK d = 2.48 μm. These data demonstrate that proteoglycans released during wound repair are functionally active and provide the first evidence that dermatan sulfate is a potent mediator of fibroblast growth factor-2 responsiveness.

Although the biological significance of these binding interactions remains unclear, the unique ability to interact with a vast array of ligands enables proteoglycans to influence several cell behaviors. This influence becomes of particular importance during inflammation and the response to injury when heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycans are thought to control the interaction between numerous cells, matrix components, and soluble effectors (10Gallo R.L.

Dermatan sulfate may also interact with several molecules primarily thought of as heparan sulfate-binding proteins, e.g. fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) (12Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14705-14710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, multiple types of GAG are likely important during inflammation, the response to injury, and related processes. Proteoglycan expression is regulated during wound repair. Abundant syndecan-1 and -4 are induced in response to injury on endothelia and fibroblasts, cell types that normally express only low amounts of these proteoglycans (10Gallo R.L. Kim C. Kokenyesi R.

A. 1994; 91: 11035-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Soluble syndecan-1 and -4 extracellular domains have also been identified in wounds (21Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The presence of both soluble and cell-surface proteoglycans provides multiple sites where cell behaviors required for wound healing may be regulated. However, although proteoglycan function has been extensively studied in vitro, little is known about native proteoglycans or GAG releasedin vivo. To determine whether soluble proteoglycan and/or GAG isolated from anin vivo source can function to support cell behaviors mediated by GAG-binding ligands, we studied the ability of purified human wound fluid GAG (WFGAG) to support FGF-2-mediated cell proliferation. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are an important family of at least nine structurally related GAG-binding molecules (11Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair.in: Clark R.A.F. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996Google Scholar). FGF-2, the best characterized member of the FGF family, is present in wounds and can function as a mitogen that signals mesenchymal cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation (22Werner S.

The interaction between FGF-2 and heparin, or heparan sulfate, has been well characterized, and function has been reported to depend on binding to these GAGs (26Klagsbrun M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 28Yayon A.

A model has been proposed in which cell-surface heparan sulfate functions as a low affinity co-receptor for FGF-2 and presents the growth factor to its high affinity signaling receptors (27Rapraeger A.C.

We report the presence in wounds of abundant soluble GAG, largely in the form of dermatan sulfate, that supports the ability of FGF-2 to signal cell proliferation. Elimination of dermatan sulfate from WFGAG resulted in an 85% reduction in FGF-2 activity. These findings directly demonstrate that proteoglycans released from in vivo sources can support cell behaviors required for wound healing. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that in addition to the ability of heparan sulfate to support FGF-2 activity, soluble dermatan sulfate also supports FGF-2-mediated cell proliferation and is likely an important molecule involved in the regulation of wound repair. Recombinant human FGF-2 was the generous gift of Dr. M. Klagsbrun, Harvard Medical School (Boston). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), chondroitin sulfate B lyase (chondroitinase B), porcine intestinal heparin, chondroitin sulfate ABC, and heparan sulfate were from Sigma.

Perides G. Vanderhaeghen J.-J. Bignami A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) against human versican was purchased from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA) or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human wound fluids routinely collected within 24 h of surgery were centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min to remove cells and debris. The use of this discarded material was approved by the Human Research Committee of the Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston), protocol number 92-5416-01. Sulfated GAG in the form of proteoglycans or free GAG chains was purified from wound fluid samples by anion exchange using QAE-Sephadex A-25 beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 2 murea, 0.5 m EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5). Wound fluid was mixed 1:1 with buffer A and incubated with buffer A pre-equilibrated QAE-Sephadex beads overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation, beads were washed sequentially with buffer A, buffer B (300 mmNaCl, 2 m urea, 0.5 m EDTA, 1 mmPMSF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5), and bound wound fluid GAG (proteoglycans or free GAG) eluted with buffer D (2 m NaCl, 2 m urea, 0.5 mEDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.5). Eluted material was precipitated twice with 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% K+ acetate, reconstituted with distilled H2O, and stored at −70 °C. In some WFGAG isolations, proteoglycans were further purified by boiling 10 min in 4 m guanidine HCl buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, followed by cesium chloride density gradient separation. The proteoglycan-containing fractions were then precipitated twice with 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% K+ acetate, reconstituted in distilled H2O, and frozen at −70 °C. Proteoglycan was isolated from discarded human skin from anonymous donors by homogenization in detergent extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 7 m urea, 0.2 mNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Tween 20, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, containing protease inhibitor mixture) for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Extracted material was centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and proteoglycans were purified from supernatants or, alternatively, the conditioned media of the A431 keratinocyte cell line by a modified version of the above anion exchange procedure. Briefly, supernatants or conditioned media were mixed 1:1 with buffer A and incubated with buffer A pre-equilibrated QAE-Sephadex A-25 beads overnight at 4 °C. Bound material was washed 3 × for 5 min with buffer B, and proteoglycans were eluted with buffer D. Eluted material was precipitated with 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% K+ acetate, reconstituted in distilled H2O, and stored at −70 °C. Sulfated GAG was measured in WFGAG samples using the sulfate-binding cationic dye, dimethylmethylene blue, according to the Blyscan Proteoglycan and GAG Assay System manufacturer's instructions (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp.). In some assays, accuracy of GAG quantitation was verified by carbazole assay which does not rely on GAG sulfation (37Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar). To measure the amount of dermatan sulfate present in wound fluid, WFGAG was digested 1 h with 2000 milliunits of chondroitinase B in 50 mm Tris containing 50 mmNaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0. Undigested material was then precipitated with 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% K+ acetate and reconstituted in distilled H2O. GAG remaining following digestion was quantitated using the Blyscan Proteoglycan and GAG Assay System. For measurement of the contribution of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate to FGF-2 responsiveness, WFGAG was digested for 1 h under identical conditions with chondroitinase B or 6 milliunits of heparitinase in 50 mmTris containing 4 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0. F32 cells, which express FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1), require interleukin-3 or heparin and FGF-2 for proliferation, and lack detectable heparan sulfate (38Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), were cultured in T75 tissue culture flasks (Falcon; Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) with RPMI 1640 media (Cellgro; Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) containing 10% calf serum, 10% P3X63 cell-conditioned media as a source of interleukin-3, and supplemented withl-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. Prior to proliferation assays cells were washed 3 times with the above media lacking interleukin-3. Cells were then added at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells/well to 96-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) in the absence or presence of 100 pm FGF-2 and test agents for 48 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. Following incubation the cells were pulsed either 6 h or overnight with 1 μCi/well [3H]thymidine and harvested using a TOMTEC Mach3–96 plate harvester (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD.). [3H]Thymidine incorporation into cells was then measured using a Microbeta 1450 plate reader running the 1450 Microbeta Workstation software package (Wallac). One mg of BSA, 0.5 μg of chondroitin sulfate, 0.5 μg of heparin, 0.5 μg of proteoglycan extracted from human skin, 0.5 μg of proteoglycan purified from A431 cell-conditioned media, or 2 μg of WFGAG samples were loaded onto cationic polyvinylidene-based membranes (Immobilon-N, Millipore, Bedford, MA) on a dot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Test wells were washed twice with 500 μl of buffer A and membranes blocked at room temperature for 1 h with Blotto blocking reagent (3% Carnation instant nonfat dry milk, 0.5% BSA, 0.3% Tween 20, 0.15 mNaCl in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, washed 3 × for 5 min with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.3% Tween 20, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in Blotto containing 0.3% Tween 20. Membranes were washed as above, and horseradish peroxidase was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (1.25 mm 3-aminophthalhydrazide, 0.2 mmcoumaric acid, 0.3 mm hydrogen peroxide in 0.1m Tris, pH 8.5). Membranes were then exposed on Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film (Eastman Kodak) and results scanned using the ScanJet 4c/T running the DeskScan II 2.3 software package (Hewlett-Packard). Binding of dermatan sulfate (Sigma) and heparin to FGF-2 was determined by ACE following derivatization of heparin with tyramine, radiolabeling, and chromatography on Sephadex G-100 to produce a low molecular weight fraction (Mr ≤6000) as described previously (39San Antonio J.D. Slover J. Lawler J. Karnovsky M.J. Lander A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Dermatan sulfate was prepared by alkaline cleavage to remove attached peptides (1 mg of GAG in 100 μl of 10% ethanol containing 0.17 mKOH for 1.5 h at 45 °C followed by adjustment of pH to 7.0), exchanged into water using a G-25 Sephadex spin column, and derivatized with tyramine as described for heparin. Tyraminated dermatan sulfate and heparin were then radiolabeled using the IODO-GEN method (Pierce). Labeled GAGs were radioprotected by addition of ethanol to 2% and stored at −80 °C until ACE analysis. The purity of125I-labeled GAGs was confirmed by susceptibility to, and resistance to, digestion with appropriate GAG lyases followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. ACE analysis was performed as described previously (40Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) with 50 mm MOPSO, pH 7.0, 125 mm sodium acetate as the gel preparation and running buffers. Gels were dried, exposed to phosphor screens (Molecular Dynamics; Sunnyvale, CA), GAG mobility measured, and converted to retardation coefficients as described previously (39San Antonio J.D. Slover J. Lawler J. Karnovsky M.J. Lander A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Data were fit using a non-linear least squares approach (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software) to the equationR = R(∞)/(1 + (K d/(P tot2)), whereR = retardation coefficient and (P tot) = protein concentration in a given gel lane. Because GAGs were labeled to high specific activity and only trace amounts were used in ACE gels, their concentrations did not factor in calculation of K d. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAG) were purified from eight wound fluid samples and quantitated using dimethylmethylene blue dye. GAG concentrations were high in all samples tested with a mean value of 31.7 μg/ml and a range from 15 to 65 μg/ml (Table I). In contrast, negligible GAG was detected in normal human sera from six individuals (data not shown), suggesting that wound fluid GAG (WFGAG) was generated during the response to injury. The concentration of WFGAG was independent of both the nature of surgery performed and volume of wound fluid generated. The ability of dimethylmethylene blue to measure accurately the sulfated GAG was verified by carbazole assay which yielded similar results (data not shown).Table IGAG composition of human wound fluidsPatientSurgeryWound fluid volumeSulfated GAGDermatan sulfatemlμg/ml%1Radical mastectomy8039.0 ± 4.257 ± 10.22Areola reconstruction18025.2 ± 2.663 ± 8.13Radical mastectomy18028.6 ± 4.455 ± 4.34Radical mastectomy4565.4 ± 8.936 ± 6.05Radical mastectomy65033.2 ± 2.538 ± 10.66Neck revision3515.2 ± 3.256 ± 447Simple mastectomy36523.2 ± 1.778 ± 3.88Radical mastectomy10023.6 ± 2.453 ± 9.5Wound fluid collected from eight randomly selected patients within 24 h of surgery was measured and GAG composition determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The proportion of the total measured GAG represented by dermatan sulfate was determined by selective digestions with chondroitinase B. Open table in a new tab Wound fluid collected from eight randomly selected patients within 24 h of surgery was measured and GAG composition determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The proportion of the total measured GAG represented by dermatan sulfate was determined by selective digestions with chondroitinase B. To determine if the GAG that predominates in skin, dermatan sulfate, was also present in a soluble form in wound fluid, WFGAG was treated with chondroitinase B to remove dermatan sulfate. Table I shows that as compared with the total amount of GAG measured in wound fluid, dermatan sulfate was always abundant and represented from 36 to 78% of the total GAG. Data shown represent maximal digestion under the above conditions as determined by separate dose response and time course determinations on these WFGAG preparations and on parallel samples of commercially purified GAG. Separate treatment of WFGAG with heparitinase demonstrated that the remaining sulfated GAG was predominantly heparan sulfate (data not shown). To evaluate which core proteins may be associated with the large quantity of GAG present in wound fluid, immunoblot analysis of WFGAG was performed with monoclonal antibodies specific for proteoglycan core proteins known to be expressed in skin (Fig. 1). Nonspecific binding of antibodies was evaluated with an excess of BSA, chondroitin sulfate ABC, or heparin. The cell-surface proteoglycans syndecan-1 and -4 were detected in GAG extracts from normal skin and conditioned media from cultured keratinocytes. These proteoglycans also appeared to be abundant in WFGAG, an observation consistent with prior reports of induction of these proteoglycans at cell surfaces in wounds (10Gallo R.L. Kim C.

A. 1994; 91: 11035-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although syndecans-2 and -3 were easily detected in normal skin extracts and keratinocyte-conditioned media, respectively, they were only faintly detected in wound fluid. The cell-surface proteoglycan, glypican, was strongly detected in WFGAG. In contrast, the keratinocyte-derived cell-surface proteoglycan, epican, was not detected. To determine whether proteoglycans normally found associated with extracellular matrix were also present in a soluble form in wound fluid, immunoblots were probed with monoclonal antibodies against decorin, perlecan, or versican. Decorin and perlecan were strongly detected in both normal skin extracts and WFGAG (Fig. 1). Interestingly, versican, like syndecan-1 and -4, was easily detected in WFGAG but not extracts from normal skin. To determine if soluble GAG produced during wound repair supports FGF-2-mediated cell proliferation, [3H]thymidine incorporation into F32 lymphoid cells, which lack cell surface heparan sulfate and express the FGF receptor, FGFR1 (38Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), was measured in the presence of FGF-2 and increasing amounts of WFGAG. The results show a dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation when cells were incubated with 100 pm FGF-2 and increasing amounts of WFGAG pooled from 10 patients (Fig. 2). Maximum proliferation occurred in the presence of ∼3 μg/ml WFGAG, severalfold less than the amount of soluble GAG measured in vivo. Results were confirmed with WFGAG further purified by boiling in 4 m guanidine HCl followed by cesium chloride gradient separation (data not shown). FGF-2-mediated cell proliferation was not seen in the absence of WFGAG or exogenously added heparin. Similarly, WFGAG was not able to support proliferation in the absence of FGF-2. Thus, F32 proliferation in response to wound fluid GAG was FGF-dependent, and FGF-2 action could be mediated by GAG(s) present in wound fluid. The large amount of dermatan sulfate present in WFGAG led us to test whether dermatan sulfate binds FGF-2 and supports FGF-2-mediated cell proliferation. To evaluate quantitatively the ability of dermatan sulfate to bind directly FGF-2 under physiological conditions of pH and ionic strength, ACE analysis was performed. Fig. 3 depicts electrophoretograms from two ACE gels, with binding to dermatan sulfate shown in Fig. 3 Aand heparin (as control) in Fig. 3 B. Dissociation constants derived from these analyses showed that dermatan sulfate bound FGF-2 with K d = 2.48 μm, about 7-fold weaker than FGF-2 binding to the more highly sulfated low molecular weight form of heparin (K d = 344 nm). The ability to bind FGF-2 suggested dermatan sulfate may also support FGF-2 bioactivity. To determine the specificity of this FGF-2 response to dermatan sulfate, commercially available pure dermatan sulfate with a molecular mass range of 11–25 kDa was used. This preparation was found to be 100% dermatan sulfate as determined by infrared spectrophotometry and contained 39.0% iduronic acid, 32.9% galactosamine, 6.77% total sulfur, and 2.82% total nitrogen. Measurement of F32 cell proliferation in the presence of pure dermatan sulfate and FGF-2 showed that the cells responded in a dose-dependent manner to dermatan sulfate (Fig. 4). Maximum proliferation in the presence of heparan sulfate was reached at a heparan sulfate dose of ∼3 μg/ml. Pure dermatan sulfate also supported FGF-2 activity at this dose although it was slightly less active. Chondroitin sulfate ABC had minimal activity at these concentrations (data not shown), although all GAGs supported FGF-2 activity at concentrations above 25 μg/ml. GAGs did not induce cell proliferation in the absence of FGF-2. To determine if dermatan sulfate in WFGAG supports FGF-2 activity, WFGAG was treated with chondroitinase B to specifically eliminate dermatan sulfate. Following confirmation of digestion by dimethylmethylene blue, measurement of F32 cell proliferation in the presence of FGF-2 demonstrated that digestion with chondroitinase B resulted in an ∼85% reduction in cell proliferation (Fig. 5). In contrast, treatment with heparitinase showed only a ∼29% reduction in proliferation. Proteoglycans have been shown in vitro to influence multiple cell behaviors by binding physiologic ligands including several growth factors, cytokines, matrix proteins, cell-surface molecules, proteases, and protease inhibitors (2Kjellén L.

In the current study, we demonstrate that abundant proteoglycans are released during wound repair in vivo, and a large proportion of the soluble GAG in wounds is chondroitin sulfate B (dermatan sulfate). We find that wound fluid GAG (WFGAG) supports the ability of FGF-2 to signal cell proliferation and that this activity resides predominantly in dermatan sulfate. These observations support the hypothesis that proteoglycans released in response to injury function as essential components in wound healing and identify a unique role for dermatan sulfate in supporting cell proliferation in response to FGF-2. Measurement of soluble GAG in wounds using dimethylmethylene blue dye demonstrated that a large amount of sulfated GAG was present in human wound fluids. Consistent with the large amounts of dermatan sulfate expressed in skin, treatment of WFGAG from individual patients with chondroitinase B showed that much of the soluble GAG was dermatan sulfate. Since dimethylmethylene blue is a relatively insensitive assay for soluble GAG determinations, measurements of total GAG may be underestimated due to the presence of nonsulfated GAG. Thus, we verified measurements with carbazole, a uronic acid binding molecule that does not rely on GAG sulfation level (37Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar). Measurements by carbazole assay confirmed the large amounts of GAG released from wounds after injury. In addition, because measurements were similar by carbazole assay there was likely little, if any, nonsulfated soluble hyaluronic acid in these wound fluid GAG preparations. Since hyaluronic acid is not sulfated, this lack of detection may have reflected loss during purification by anion exchange, or alternatively, there may be negligible release into the wound environment. Purification of WFGAG by anion exchange can yield intact proteoglycans or free GAG. Measurement of GAG using dimethylmethylene blue, or carbazole, does not distinguish between these GAG forms, and both may be present in wound fluid. Immunoblot analysis of purified WFGAG using monoclonal antibodies against a panel of proteoglycans likely to be found in cutaneous wounds showed that WFGAG contains several types of proteoglycan core proteins. Since these core proteins were detected in wound fluid that was purified by anion exchange, they remain associated with GAG. Therefore, multiple core proteins in the form of proteoglycans are released into the wound environment. The mechanism of this proteoglycan release into wounds remains unknown, but thrombin, growth factor receptor activation, and the action of calcium ionophores or protein kinase C activators have been reported to release cell surface-associated molecules, including proteoglycans, from cells in culture (21Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 41Pandiella A. Massague J. J. Biol.

Thus, multiple mechanisms may generate soluble proteoglycan and may represent the mechanism of proteoglycan release in wounds. Proteoglycans associated with cell surfaces or extracellular matrix were both found in a soluble form in wound fluid. Furthermore, there was specificity of proteoglycan release in wounds; not all proteoglycans were released to the same extent after injury. This selectivity of proteoglycan release is also consistent with prior observations of induction of syndecans on cell surfaces after injuryin vitro (20Gallo R.L. Ono M. Povsic T. Page C. Eriksson E. Klagsbrun M. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11035-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and in vivo (10Gallo R.L. Kim C. Kokenyesi R. Adzick N.S. Bernfield M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 667-683Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar), as well as prior detection of syndecan-1 and -4 in wound fluids (21Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Together, these data demonstrate that several proteoglycans from various compartments are present in wound fluids where they may act to affect cell behaviors required for wound repair. In addition, proteoglycans known to contain heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfates (including dermatan sulfate) were both detected in wound fluid. Thus, multiple soluble proteoglycans are located at sites where their presence can influence cell responsiveness to GAG-binding ligands that function during wound repair. FGF-2 is an important GAG-binding growth factor that signals the proliferation of cells that function in response to injury (44Abraham J.A. Klagsburn M. Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair.in: Clark R.A.F. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996Google Scholar). Several heparan sulfate proteoglycans derived from tissue culture cells including syndecans, glypican, and perlecan have been shown to bind and support FGF activity (45Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 46Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A. Vlodavsky I. Carey D.J. Asundi V.K. Reich-Slotky R.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1938-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The presence of a large amount of soluble GAG in wounds suggested that native proteoglycans released after injuryin vivo may also influence FGF function. To test this hypothesis, the ability of WFGAG to support FGF-2-mediated cell proliferation was measured. F32 cells were chosen because they contain transfected FGF receptor, FGFR1, and lack endogenous heparan sulfate (38Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Thus, using this model, FGF-2 activity supported by GAG purified from an in vivo source could be studied directly. The results of these studies demonstrated that WFGAG supported FGF-2-mediated cell proliferation at GAG concentrations well below the physiological levels we have measured in wound fluid. The ability of WFGAG to support FGF-2-mediated proliferation was not the result of growth factor contamination of WFGAG preparations because WFGAG boiled in 4 m guanidine and further purified by cesium chloride density gradient separation also supported FGF-2 activity. Likewise, WFGAG did not support cell proliferation in the absence of added FGF-2. Thus, soluble proteoglycans generated in wounds support FGF-2 function. Our finding that large amounts of soluble dermatan sulfate were present in wounds led us to evaluate whether dermatan sulfate could directly influence FGF function. Affinity co-electrophoresis showed that dermatan sulfate bound FGF-2, and pure dermatan sulfate supported FGF-2-mediated cell proliferation. This effect was observed at concentrations at, or below, that of dermatan sulfate in wounds. To determine if dermatan sulfate in wounds also supported FGF-2 bioactivity, WFGAG was treated with chondroitinase B to specifically eliminate dermatan sulfate. This treatment decreased FGF-2 activity by ∼85%. The nature of the FGF-2 binding domains within dermatan sulfate was not determined. However, these data confirm that both pure dermatan sulfate and dermatan sulfate present in wound fluid support FGF-2-mediated cell proliferation. Future studies will be needed to map the GAG sequences that confer this activity. The observation that dermatan sulfate supported FGF-2 activity is consistent with report of the ability of dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfates A and C, to bind FGF-2 (12Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dermatan sulfate to inhibit 125I-FGF-2 binding to extracellular matrix-coated tissue culture wells (49Bashkin P. Doctrow S. Klagsbrun M. Svahn C.M. Folkman J. Vlodavsky I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dermatan sulfate has been found to interact with other molecules previously known to interact only with heparan sulfate (13Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Rahmoune H. Fernig D.G. Nakamur T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15Mascellani G. Liverani L. Bianchini P. Parma B. Torri G. Bisio A. Guerrini M.

Bielek E. Vanyek E. Binder B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14705-14710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, when considered in context with the large quantity of dermatan sulfate present in wounds, and the affinity we measured of dermatan sulfate for FGF-2 (K d = 2.48 μm), it appears that dermatan sulfate is a major contributor to FGF-2 responsiveness in the wound environment. This study demonstrates that abundant functionally active proteoglycan is present in human wound fluids. This places GAGs at sites where they can act as soluble effectors to influence cell behaviors required for wound repair. Soluble GAG was derived both from cell surfaces and extracellular matrix. Thus, insoluble GAG serves as a source for release in response to injury and by release has paracrine potential at distant sites. The novel finding that dermatan sulfate released following injury supported FGF-2 activity further suggests that non-heparan sulfate proteoglycans also participate in the regulation of growth factor responsiveness. The specific proteoglycans that are responsible for supporting FGF-2 activity have not been identified, but demonstration of the presence of several core proteins indicates that numerous proteoglycans have the potential to function as a source of biologically active GAG in vivo. Further study of dermatan sulfate GAGs and their established ligands will contribute to our understanding of wound repair and related processes."

Apoptosis or programmed cell death plays a major role during development, homeostasis, and immune response in multicellular organisms. Inappropriate apoptosis may contribute to the pathology of many human diseases, including cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and neurodegenerative disorders. Substantial progress has been made in understanding the control and mechanisms of apoptosis (1Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar,2Jacobsen M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, major aspects of the apoptotic pathway remain undefined, and little is known about the molecular events controlling this process. It has proven difficult to identify the molecules involved in apoptosis by conventional biochemical and molecular approaches at the mRNA level. However, the process of apoptosis can be initiated by a variety of stimuli and results in defined morphological and biochemical changes (3Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12858) Google Scholar) that may be easier studied at the protein level. Apoptosis is characterized by cellular and nuclear shrinkage, cytoplasmic blebbing, condensation of nuclear chromatin, and fragmentation of nuclear DNA (3Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12858) Google Scholar, 4Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cotter T.G. Trends Biochem.

Analysis of the apoptotic pathway in lymphocytes revealed several molecules as key controllers in the execution of apoptosis (5Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Science. 1996; 274: 67-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Anti-IgM antibody-mediated apoptosis is thought to be controlled on at least two levels by the members of thebcl-2 gene family and the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme/Ced3-like cysteine proteases now called caspases. A large number of caspases have been described (6Kumar S. Harvey N.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Cohen G.M. Biochem.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 245-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but the individual roles of most intracellular proteases and their substrates remain to be elucidated. A number of proteins have been shown to be involved and specifically cleaved during apoptosis (16Rickers A. Brockstedt E. Mapara M.Y. Otto A. Dörken B. Bommert K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Death substrates that are cleaved by caspases include poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (9Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We have already shown that caspase 3 plays a crucial role in anti-IgM antibody-induced B cell apoptosis. Cleavage of the Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor D4-GDI as well as apoptosis can be completely inhibited by Z-DEVD-FMK, a specific inhibitor of caspase 3-like proteases (16Rickers A. Brockstedt E. Mapara M.Y. Otto A. Dörken B. Bommert K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide the first evidence that the protein hnRNP A1 is specifically cleaved into three distinct fragments of the apparent sizes 32, 29, and 16 kDa, respectively, during anti-IgM antibody-induced apoptosis visualized by Western blot analysis. Cleavage can be completely inhibited by Z-DEVD-FMK, leading to the conclusion that hnRNP A1 is specifically cleaved by caspase 3-like proteases. Different proteins like HP1α (heterochromatinprotein 1 homologue α), FBP, dUTPase, HHR23B (UV excision repair protein RAD23 homologue B), LSP1 (lymphocyte-specific protein1), ribosomal protein P0, and neutral calponin seem also to be involved in anti-IgM antibody-induced apoptosis since alterations of these proteins could also be inhibited by Z-DEVD-FMK. This was shown by high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis (2-DE) of protein extracts from cells, which prior to anti-IgM antibody stimulation were treated with Z-DEVD-FMK. A new micropreparative approach for the two-dimensional gel separation of the complex protein mixture is described that facilitated the analysis of these proteins. The human Burkitt lymphoma cell line BL60-2 was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 nm bathocuproinedisulfonic acid, and 50 μmα-thioglycerol at 37 °C and 5% CO2 as described previously (16Rickers A. Brockstedt E. Mapara M.Y. Otto A. Dörken B. Bommert K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was induced by adding 1.3 μg/ml anti-IgM F(ab)2 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) to the cell culture medium. The rate of apoptosis was measured by acridine orange staining or FITC-conjugated annexin V (Bender Medical System, Vienna, Austria) labeling as described previously. After 24 h of anti-IgM antibody treatment, the separation of apoptotic cells from non-apoptotic cells by FITC-conjugated annexin labeling and subsequent magnetic separation with anti-FITC magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Gladbach, Germany) were performed. Inhibition of apoptosis was performed by incubating the cells with 200 μm Z-DEVD-FMK (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, Bad Soden/Taunus, Germany) 30 min prior to addition of anti-IgM F(ab)2 essentially as described previously (16Rickers A. Brockstedt E. Mapara M.Y. Otto A. Dörken B. Bommert K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). BL60-2 cells from different time points after incubation with anti-IgM antibody were centrifuged and washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were lysed (20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.27 mmsucrose, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) for 40 min at 4 °C. Proteins (30 μg/lane) were electrophoretically separated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to nitrocellulose and blocking, filters were incubated with 1:1000 diluted anti-hnRNP A1 antibody (a kind gift from Gideon Dreyfuss). Thereafter, filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:15000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cell pellets were thawed and, during this procedure, rapidly mixed with protease inhibitor solutions (17Wittmann-Liebold B. Jungblut P. Wrede P. Schneider G. Concepts in Protein Engineering and Design. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1994: 47-107Crossref Google Scholar). The final concentrations of protease inhibitors in the protein sample were 1.4 μm pepstatin A, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 2.1 μm leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmKCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.1) according to Klose and Kobalz (18Klose J. Kobalz U. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1034-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Additionally, the pellet was rapidly mixed with urea (9m final concentration), then with dithiothreitol (70 mm final concentration), and finally with 2% carrier ampholytes for analytical gels or 6% carrier ampholytes for micropreparative gels (Servalyt pH 2–4, Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). After 30 min of gentle stirring at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged in an ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 25 min. The clear supernatant was frozen at −70 °C. The resulting protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis (19Meltzer N.M. Tous G.I. Gruber S. Stein S. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Yokote Y. Murayama A. Akahne K. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and was 30–35 mg/ml. 1–2 μl of these samples were loaded at the anodic side on an analytical gel, and 100–120 μl were applied on a micropreparative gel. The proteins were separated by the large gel 2-DE technique (18Klose J. Kobalz U. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1034-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The complete 2-DE equipment and ready-to-use gel solutions were purchased from Wittmann Institute of Technology and Analysis of Biomolecules GmbH (Teltow, Germany). The 20-cm isoelectric focusing rod gels (inner diameter of analytical and micropreparative gels: 0.09 and 0.25 cm, respectively) contained 3.5% acrylamide, 0.3% piperazine diacrylamide (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany), and a total of 4% (w/v) carrier ampholytes (pH 2–11) (WITA GmbH). The electrophoretic conditions of the analytical gels during the isoelectric focusing were according to Klose and Kobalz (18Klose J. Kobalz U. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1034-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic conditions of the micropreparative gels during isoelectric focusing were as follows: 1 h at 100 V, 1 h at 250 V, 17.5 h at 570 V, 1 h at 1000 V, 30 min at 1500 V, and 10 min at 2000 V. After focusing, the rod gels were equilibrated for 10 min in a buffer containing 125 mm Tris phosphate (pH 6.9), 40% glycerol, 70 mm dithiothreitol, and 3% SDS. The equilibrated rod gels were frozen at −70 °C. After thawing, the isoelectric focusing rod gels were immediately applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel that contained 15% (w/v) acrylamide and 0.2% N, N′-methylenebisacrylamide. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) was used, but the stacking gel was replaced by an equilibrated isoelectric focusing gel. Electrophoresis of the analytical SDS-polyacrylamide gel (30 × 23 × 0.075 cm) was performed using a two-step increase of current, starting with 15 min at 65 mA, followed by a run of 7–8 h at 85 mA, until the dye reached the end of the gel. Electrophoresis of the micropreparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel (30 × 23 × 0.15 cm) was also performed using a two-step increase of current, starting with 15 min at 130 mA, followed by a run of 7–8 h at 170 mA, until the dye reached the end of the gel. For analytical gels, the proteins were silver-stained based on the procedure of Klose and Kobalz (18Klose J. Kobalz U. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1034-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). For micropreparative gels, the proteins were stained by Coomassie Blue as described by Eckerskorn et al. (22Eckerskorn C. Jungblut P. Mewes W. Klose J. Lottspeich F. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 830-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For micropreparative investigations, up to 10 Coomassie Blue-stained protein spots of the same protein were combined from the micropreparative gels. Enzymatic in-gel digestion with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), extraction of the peptides from the gel, desalting, and concentration by reversed-phase material (Serva) were performed according to Otto et al. (23Otto A. Thiede B. Müller E.-C. Scheler C. Wittmann-Liebold B. Jungblut P. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The separation of the peptides was performed using a microbore HPLC system and a column of 2.1-mm inner diameter and 10-cm length (μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10, Smart System, Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). A gradient with an increasing concentration of acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and a flow rate of 100 μl/min at room temperature was used. The peptide fractions were concentrated in a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant, Hicksville, NY) and loaded onto a Biobrene-coated glass fiber filter of a Procise or 477A pulsed liquid-phase sequencer with an on-line 120A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer (Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing reagents were purchased from Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems (Weiterstadt, Germany). MALDI-MS was performed with a VG Tof Spec (Fisons, Manchester, United Kingdom) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm; pulse duration of 4 ns) and a VAX 400 VLC station using OPUS software (Version 3.1). Spectra were obtained in the linear or reflectron mode by summing 20–50 laser shots. A saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in aqueous 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as matrix (24Thiede B. Otto A. Zimny-Arndt Müller E.-C. Jungblut P. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 588-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The matrix (1.2 μl) and sample (0.8 μl) were mixed on the target and air-dried. For mass determination, the dried target was inserted into the mass spectrometer. Measurement took place under vacuum at 22 or 24 kV. The peptide mass maps produced by MALDI-MS were searched using the program FRAGMOD (E.-C. Müller, Max-Delbrück-Centrum für Molekulare Medizin, Berlin-Buch, Germany), a modified version of the FRAGFIT program (25Henzel W.J. Billeci T.M. Stults J.T. Wong S.C. Grimley C. Watanabe C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5011-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences were compared with the SWISS-PROT Data Bank (release of June 1997) and with the deduced amino acid sequences of the GenBankTM/EMBL Data Bank (release of June 97). To determine proteins involved in the regulation of anti-IgM antibody-induced apoptosis, we used a subclone of a Burkitt lymphoma cell line (BL60-2). After 24 h of treatment with anti-IgM antibody, 40–50% of the BL60-2 cells bound FITC-conjugated annexin V as measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and 50–60% showed fragmented nuclei after acridine orange staining (16Rickers A. Brockstedt E. Mapara M.Y. Otto A. Dörken B. Bommert K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Both measurements are sensitive and reliable indicators for programmed cell death. 24 h after stimulation with anti-IgM antibody, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated annexin V and subsequently with anti-FITC microbeads. Separation of apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells was achieved using magnetic separation columns. By this method, we could increase the sensitivity and facilitate the detection of proteins that were cleaved or down-regulated. The investigations of apoptosis-associated proteins were aimed at elucidating protein changes between an apoptotic state and a non-apoptotic state by means of subtractive protein analysis (17Wittmann-Liebold B. Jungblut P. Wrede P. Schneider G. Concepts in Protein Engineering and Design. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1994: 47-107Crossref Google Scholar, 26Aebersold R. Leavitt J. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 540-546Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 2-DE (27Klose J. Humangenetik. 1975; 26: 231-243PubMed Google Scholar, 28O'Farell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a resolution of up to 10,000 proteins (18Klose J. Kobalz U. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1034-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) can be used to investigate complex protein mixtures. Protein spot positions and intensities were compared between patterns of apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells on analytical gels. Protein spots that were significantly different in intensity were analyzed by tryptic in-gel digestion, subsequent mass analysis of the eluted peptide mixture, and/or Edman microsequencing of the microbore HPLC-separated peptides (23Otto A. Thiede B. Müller E.-C. Scheler C. Wittmann-Liebold B. Jungblut P. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, a prerequisite for successful protein analysis using 2-DE is the ability to apply high protein concentrations to the gel without losing the high resolution power of analytical gels. We increased the protein concentration up to four times on micropreparative gels compared with earlier investigations (23Otto A. Thiede B. Müller E.-C. Scheler C. Wittmann-Liebold B. Jungblut P. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We used Coomassie Blue-stained micropreparative gels as described under “Experimental Procedures” with comparable resolution and reproducibility to silver-stained analytical gels for microanalysis. In this way, we could avoid the protein in-gel concentration procedure (29Gevaert K. Rider M. Puype M. Van Damme J. De Boeck S. Vanderkerckhove J. Zouhair Atassi M. Apella E. Methods in Protein Structure Analysis. Plenum Press, New York1995: 15-20Crossref Google Scholar). The 2-DE protein map of non-apoptotic cells containing ∼3250 protein spots is shown in Fig. 1. Spots X (actin, 42 kDa, pI 5.3), Y (fatty acid-binding protein, 15 kDa, pI 6.6), and Z (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 36 kDa, pI 8.6) were identified by mass fingerprinting and were used as markers for molecular mass and pI on the gel. The visual comparison between 10 2-DE patterns of non-apoptotic versus apoptotic B-cells revealed ∼80 protein spots that were significantly altered in intensity. After IgM-mediated apoptosis, spots of increasing intensity should be due to up-regulation of the expression of a protein. In addition, protein fragments occurred newly, e.g. when cleaved by a protease or due to specific cleavage by a caspase activity. Spots decreasing in intensity could be due to down-regulation of a protein or to degradation or fragmentation of a protein. The framed areas 1–9 in the 2-DE pattern of non-apoptotic cells in Fig. 1 were then compared with the corresponding areas in the 2-DE pattern of apoptotic cells. Differences in the protein spot pattern are marked byletters (Figs. 2 and 3). To identify an altered protein spot unequivocally, we employed two different approaches, namely internal Edman microsequencing and peptide mass fingerprinting. An example of the identification of the protein dUTPase by mass fingerprinting is shown in Fig. 4. The identification of the protein neutral calponin by internal Edman microsequencing and an HPLC-separated peptide pattern are demonstrated in Fig. 5. These methods resulted in the identification of 12 proteins, as demonstrated in Table I, that are associated with anti-IgM antibody-mediated apoptosis. We found that actin, lamin B1, nucleolin, and hnRNP C1/C2 are fragmented. Neutral calponin, LSP1, HHR23B, ribosomal protein P0, FBP, dUTPase, hnRNP A1, and HP1α are either up- or down-regulated during the apoptotic process of anti-IgM antibody-induced apoptosis. These proteins and their functional role in the apoptotic process will be discussed below.Figure 2Enlargement of the 2-DE pattern of non-apoptotic BL60-2 cell line proteins (panel 1) and the comparable enlargement of apoptotic BL60-2 cell line proteins (panel 1*).

In the protein pattern of apoptotic cells (Fig. 3, panel 5*), a new spot (K′) could be detected. This spot was not present in the protein pattern of non-apoptotic cells (Fig. 3, panel 5). To investigate the onset of cleavage, we performed Western blot analysis utilizing the monoclonal antibody 4B10. Fig. 6 shows that hnRNP A1 was cleaved into at least three distinct fragments. Fragments A and B appeared after 8–12 h of incubation with anti-IgM antibodies. The smallest fragment (C) occurred after 24 h and corresponded in size to spot K′, which was identified on the 2-DE gel. Recently, we showed that caspase 3 is a crucial protease in anti-IgM antibody-induced apoptosis (16Rickers A. Brockstedt E. Mapara M.Y. Otto A. Dörken B. Bommert K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the global 2-DE approach used here, we found that by incubation with Z-DEVD-FMK, a cell-permeable irreversible inhibitor specific for caspase 3-like proteases, prior to stimulation with anti-IgM antibody, apoptosis could be completely inhibited. We therefore analyzed if hnRNP A1 cleavage in the cells could be blocked by Z-DEVD-FMK as investigated by Western blotting with antibodies raised against this protein. Fig. 7 A shows that after addition of 200 μm Z-DEVD-FMK prior to anti-IgM antibody incubation, the generation of all three cleavage products was inhibited. (Fragment C could only be detected after overexposure of the Western blot (Fig. 7 B).) We could not identify a potential caspase 3 cleavage site (DXXD) in the hnRNP A1 amino acid sequence, indicating that caspase 3 probably has still other recognition sites that are currently unknown; another possibility would be that hnRN"
https://openalex.org/W2007087244,"The secretory lysosomes of cytolytic lymphocytes house the principal apoptotic molecules for eliminating virus-infected cells: a membranolytic agent, perforin, and the serine protease, granzyme B. Perforin allows granzyme B access to cytosolic and nuclear substrates that, when cleaved, result in the characteristic apoptotic phenotype. Key among these substrates is a family of cytoplasmic caspases that mediate cell suicide. We have examined the caspase dependence of several nuclear and cytoplasmic parameters of apoptosis induced by purified perforin and granzyme B. Cell membrane leakage in response to perforin and granzyme B was independent of caspase activation; however, nuclear events such as DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation and disintegration were abolished by the broad-acting caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk. Despite being spared from nuclear damage, z-VAD-fmk-treated cells exposed to both cytotoxins uniformly died when they were re-cultured, while cells exposed to perforin or granzyme alone survived and proliferated as readily as untreated cells. Pretreatment of cells with z-VAD-fmk also resulted in reduced granzyme B nuclear uptake following addition of perforin; however, its uptake into the cytoplasm in the absence of perforin was unaffected. We conclude that cell death in response to perforin and granzyme B does not require caspase activation and still proceeds efficiently through non-nuclear pathways when nuclear substrate cleavage is inhibited.

Cytolytic lymphocytes (CL),1 comprising cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells, kill target cells by two contact-dependent mechanisms (1Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 202-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The first mechanism depends on multimerization of Fas receptors on target cells by interaction with CL Fas ligand molecules (2Nagata S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 406: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and plays a principal role in homeostasis of lymphoid tissues during thymic development, following viral infection and in regulating autoreactive T cell populations in the periphery (1Smyth M.J.

Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). By contrast, the second mechanism involves exocytosis of granule-bound toxins, including an essential membranolytic protein perforin and the serine protease granzyme B (grB), resulting in uptake of grB into the cytosol of the target cell (1Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 202-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 4Shi L. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp.

Med. 1997; 185: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The main physiological role of granule exocytosis is thought to be in eliminating virus-infected cells and in NK effector function, as demonstrated by the reduced resistance of perforin-deficient mice to certain viruses and other intracellular pathogens (6Kagi D. Ledermann B. Burki K. et al.Nature. 1994; 369: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of synergy between perforin and grB is yet to be determined at the molecular level, it has been proposed that grB enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis and that perforin disrupts these endosomes, enabling grB to reach key substrates in the cytosol and nucleus (7Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Gottlieb R. Babior B. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W. J. Biol.

Today. 1998; 19: 30-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).One fundamental function of grB is that it mimics the cleavage specificity of the caspase family of pro-apoptotic cysteine proteases, thus permitting it to activate the generic cell suicide pathway present in virtually all cells (9Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 10Darmon A.J. Ley T.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21709-21712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Both grB and the caspases have a strong preference for substrates with Asp at the P1 position, in the selective context of at least three other residues at P2-P4 (11Poe M. Blake J.T. Boulton D.A.

Therefore, grB can both activate and greatly amplify the caspase cascade and may directly cleave many caspase substrates such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase, and NuMA to bring about apoptotic changes in cells (13Andrade, F., Roy, S., Nicholson, D., Thornberry, N., Rosen, A., and Casciola-Rosen, L.

While cell death mediated via Fas is totally dependent on an intact caspase cascade, it has recently been shown that granule-mediated cell death can proceed independently of caspases, principally through a non-nuclear pathway (15Sarin A. Williams M.S. Alexander-Miller M.A. Berzofsky J.A. Zacharchuk C.M. Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1997; 6: 209-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 16Sutton V.R. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, granule-mediated cytolysis is a rare example of caspase-independent apoptosis. The significance of this observation is that many viruses can postpone cell death by expressing caspase inhibitors typified by the cowpoxvirus product crmA (17Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M.

Zhu N. et al.J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to block cell suicide and Fas-mediated death. These findings have led us to hypothesize that granule-bound cytolytic pathways may have co-evolved with viruses that thwart cell suicide, specifically to provide the host with a means of clearing viral pathogens adept at frustrating “altruistic” death of a colonized cell. 2J.

Smyth, submitted for publication.We have been interested in defining the key cellular sites for grB proteolysis in cells simultaneously exposed to perforin, as a prelude to identifying non-caspase death substrates for this protease. We have recently demonstrated that grB can very rapidly accumulate in the nucleus following its egress from endosomes, providing further evidence that nuclear structures may be cleaved directly by grB (20Trapani J.A.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10225-10229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have suggested the nucleus as an important site of grB action, as the highest grB concentrations occur in the nucleus (20Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Smyth M.J. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4127-4133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), well before other nuclear changes such as DNA fragmentation and nuclear membrane damage have taken place (21Jans D.A.

Williams E.A. Sutton V.R. Jans D.A. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, nuclear destruction might be one way by which CL circumvent a block to apoptosis arising from expression of crmA-like inhibitors by viruses. This possibility has been strengthened by recent observations that grB can cleave several nuclear substrates of caspases, sometimes at sites distinct from those used by caspases (13Andrade, F., Roy, S., Nicholson, D., Thornberry, N., Rosen, A., and Casciola-Rosen, L. (1998) Immunity 451–460Google Scholar). However, this likelihood stands at odds with previous findings that CLs bypass caspase inhibition by inducing cytoplasmic, not nuclear events that result in cell death (15Sarin A. Williams M.S. Alexander-Miller M.A. Berzofsky J.A. Zacharchuk C.M. Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1997; 6: 209-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CTL are capable of killing enucleated cytoplasts, indicating that the cell nucleus is not a requirement for cell death (24Nakajima H. Golstein P. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1905-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here, we show that grB and perforin can overcome a block in caspase-induced apoptosis, but that apoptosis in these circumstances proceeds without appreciable nuclear damage, and most significantly, despite the exclusion of grB from the nucleus. Our results suggest that non-nuclear sites of action are most important for granule-mediated cytolysis in the presence of endogenous caspase inhibition. Cytolytic lymphocytes (CL),1 comprising cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells, kill target cells by two contact-dependent mechanisms (1Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 202-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The first mechanism depends on multimerization of Fas receptors on target cells by interaction with CL Fas ligand molecules (2Nagata S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 406: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and plays a principal role in homeostasis of lymphoid tissues during thymic development, following viral infection and in regulating autoreactive T cell populations in the periphery (1Smyth M.J.

Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). By contrast, the second mechanism involves exocytosis of granule-bound toxins, including an essential membranolytic protein perforin and the serine protease granzyme B (grB), resulting in uptake of grB into the cytosol of the target cell (1Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 202-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 4Shi L. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp.

Med. 1997; 185: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The main physiological role of granule exocytosis is thought to be in eliminating virus-infected cells and in NK effector function, as demonstrated by the reduced resistance of perforin-deficient mice to certain viruses and other intracellular pathogens (6Kagi D. Ledermann B. Burki K. et al.Nature. 1994; 369: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of synergy between perforin and grB is yet to be determined at the molecular level, it has been proposed that grB enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis and that perforin disrupts these endosomes, enabling grB to reach key substrates in the cytosol and nucleus (7Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Gottlieb R. Babior B. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W. J. Biol.

Today. 1998; 19: 30-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). One fundamental function of grB is that it mimics the cleavage specificity of the caspase family of pro-apoptotic cysteine proteases, thus permitting it to activate the generic cell suicide pathway present in virtually all cells (9Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 10Darmon A.J. Ley T.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21709-21712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Both grB and the caspases have a strong preference for substrates with Asp at the P1 position, in the selective context of at least three other residues at P2-P4 (11Poe M. Blake J.T. Boulton D.A.

https://openalex.org/W1601128563,"Satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar is uniquely suited to monitoring year-to-year deformation of the entire Yellowstone caldera (about 3000 square kilometers). Sequential interferograms indicate that subsidence within the caldera migrated from one resurgent dome to the other between August 1992 and August 1995. Between August 1995 and September 1996, the caldera region near the northeast dome began to inflate, and accompanying surface uplift migrated to the southwest dome between September 1996 and June 1997. These deformation data are consistent with hydrothermal or magmatic fluid migration into and out of two sill-like bodies that are about 8 kilometers directly beneath the caldera."

We report here that the initial step of delivery, binding of the conjugate to the cell surface, is a barrier to gene transfer. We examined the effects of conjugate charge, ligand cross-linker spacer length, and ligand valency on polyplex cell surface binding, internalization, and gene transfer. We find that delivery is both efficient and specific only within a relatively narrow window of conjugate charge, results that correlate with binding and internalization of radiolabeled conjugate. In addition, increasing the cross-linker length can improve binding affinity and delivery.

The molecular conjugate, or polyplex, is a synthetic gene delivery vector composed of nucleic acids condensed with polycations that can be cross-linked to a ligand for cell targeting. After binding to the cell surface, conjugates are internalized, and a small fraction of them escapes the endocytic network and translocates to the nucleus, where genes within the DNA of the polyplex are expressed. Investigations of conjugates have demonstrated the ability for specific receptor-mediated delivery via a wide variety of ligands (1Wu G.Y. Wu C.H. J. Biol.

Despite significant promise and progress, however, conjugate delivery efficiency must be further improved before it can match that of many viral vectors. There is strong evidence that escape from the endocytic network poses a significant obstacle to polyplex gene delivery (10Cotten M. Wagner E. Zatloukal K. Phillips S. Curiel D.T. Birnstiel M.L. Proc.

Mechanistic study of the cell biology of gene transfer, however, can reveal additional barriers to gene delivery, as well as identify means to engineer conjugates to overcome those barriers. One of these potential obstacles is the initial step of cellular delivery, binding of the polyplex to the cell surface. Several properties of the molecular conjugate can affect how it interacts with a cell surface. First, the cell surface membrane is negatively charged due to its lipid, glycoprotein, and proteoglycan components (17Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Therefore, since the net charge of molecular conjugates may determine the degree of binding due to specific receptor-ligand versus nonspecific charge interactions, the overall ratio of polycation to nucleic acid in a conjugate preparation can significantly affect delivery efficiency and specificity. In addition, cross-linking a ligand to conjugates can potentially reduce its affinity for a receptor and thereby lessen conjugate binding and delivery. Finally, since a cell expresses a limited number of receptors, the number of ligands presented by each molecular conjugate can determine how rapidly they deplete the receptor pool. We have previously described a system that employs epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 as a ligand to direct delivery of a gene encoding GFP to mouse fibroblasts expressing the EGF receptor (18Schaffer D.V. Neve R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Tissue Eng. 1997; 3: 53-63Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Conjugates are generated by condensing plasmid DNA with polylysine cross-linked to streptavidin, followed by tethering biotinylated EGF to the conjugate surface. Using this system, we have investigated whether polyplex binding to the cell surface is a rate-limiting step in gene delivery. We determined that the ligand cross-linker spacer length, the conjugate charge ratio, and the number of ligands present affect molecular conjugate binding, internalization, and gene delivery. Furthermore, optimization of these properties significantly enhances conjugate gene delivery efficiency and specificity. Mouse EGF, penicillin-streptomycin,l-glutamine, trypsin-EDTA, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, G418, and minimum Eagle's medium-α were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Proteins were iodinated with Na125I (EN Life Science Products) using Iodobeads (Pierce). Unless otherwise mentioned, all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Streptavidin-polylysine cross-linking and purification were conducted as described previously (18Schaffer D.V. Neve R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Tissue Eng. 1997; 3: 53-63Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Three types of biotinylated EGF were synthesized by reacting EGF in HEPES-buffered saline with a 10-fold molar excess of Sulfo-NHS-Biotin, Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin, or Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Pierce) followed by purification on a G-25 column and quantitation by absorbance at 280 nm. pEGFP-C1 plasmid DNA (CLONTECH) was propagated in the DH5α Escherichia coli strain and purified with a Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). To form polyplexes, plasmid was added to a 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 1 m NaCl solution at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Streptavidin-polylysine was added while vortexing, and the resulting complexes were extensively dialyzed against HEPES-buffered saline using 1000 MWCO membrane (Spectrum). Biotin-EGF was then added to the complexes, and the solution was incubated for 1 h. The maximum valency, the number of biotin-EGF molecules present per plasmid, was determined by incubating streptavidin-polylysine-DNA complexes with radioactively labeled biotinylated EGF. Biotin-EGF, generated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin, was iodinated to a specific activity of 123,000 cpm/ng and separated from free iodine with a G-25 column. Increasing amounts of the complex were added to 0.165 nmol of radiolabeled biotin-EGF in HEPES-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h. The samples were then centrifuged through 30,000 MWCO Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter units (Millipore) and washed twice with 0.1% Triton X-100 in HEPES-buffered saline. Radioactivity retained on the filters was counted with a Packard Instruments 5000 series γ-counter. The efficiency of biotinylation by Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin was tested.125I-Biotin-EGF in phoshate-buffered saline was incubated with streptavidin-agarose for 1 h, both with and without 2 mm free biotin. The agarose was pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with 4 volumes of 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and the amount of radioactivity bound to duplicate samples of the agarose was counted. Swiss 3T3-derived NR6 fibroblasts, which lack endogenous EGF receptors, had been transfected with a gene encoding the wild-type human EGFR and selected with G418, as described previously (19Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium-α supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (2.5 μg/ml), 350 μg/ml G418, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C. For gene delivery experiments, 50,000 cells, counted with a Coulter Electronics Multisizer II, were seeded on 35-mm tissue culture dishes (Corning) and grown overnight. Polyplexes containing 1 μg of DNA were then added to the cells in gene transfer medium, growth medium lacking fetal bovine serum but containing 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium supplement (Life Technologies Inc.) plus 100 μm chloroquine, to yield a total volume of 1 ml. Free EGF (1 μg/ml) was added to some samples. After 6 h, the conjugate solution was aspirated and replaced with regular growth medium. The duplicate samples were trypsinized 48 h later and analyzed for GFP expression using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickson) with a 488-nm excitation laser and a 530/30-nm fluorescein emission filter. Radiolabeled conjugates were generated using125I- streptavidin-polylysine (SA-pK). SA-pK was iodinated to a specific activity of 64,700 cpm/ng of streptavidin and purified with SP Sepharose HP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 100,000 cpm were added for each microgram of DNA while vortexing. Conjugates were then generated as described above, using biotin-EGF generated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin. A negligible amount of radioactivity was lost during dialysis. For binding measurements, subconfluent cells were removed from tissue culture plastic by incubation in 2 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C, centrifuged, and resuspended in gene transfer medium buffered by 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Radiolabeled conjugates containing 0.1 μg of DNA were added to 50,000 cells in a 0.1-ml total volume, and duplicate samples were agitated at 4 °C for 3 h. Cells were then separated from free conjugate using a MultiScreen filtration assay system (Millipore) with 96-well 0.2-μm Durapore filtration plates preblocked with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After loading of the cell suspensions and application of vacuum, the filters were washed five times with 0.2 ml of ice-cold WHIPS (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone), and the radioactivity retained on the filters was counted. For internalization measurements, 100,000 cells were plated on 35-mm dishes and grown overnight. Radiolabeled conjugates containing 1 μg of DNA in 0.1 ml were added with 0.9 ml of gene transfer medium to cells, and duplicate cell samples were incubated for various times in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C. The conjugate solutions were then aspirated, and the cells were washed twice for 2 min with 1 ml of acidic salt strip (50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.0, 2 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone) to remove conjugates bound to the cell surface and the tissue culture plastic. The cells were solubilized with 1 n NaOH, and the internalized radioactivity was counted. Some binding and internalization experiments were conducted in the presence of 1 μg/ml unlabeled EGF, and all data were statistically analyzed by at test. To determine the effects of multiple biotin-EGF occupancy of a single streptavidin protein on ligand affinity, binding of conjugates to cells was conducted in the presence of biotinylated aprotonin, generated as described above for biotin-EGF, but with a threefold molar ratio of Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin. Radiolabeled conjugates at a valency of 15 were generated, and cell surface binding was conducted as described above, but in the absence and presence of excess biotin-aprotonin at a molar ratio of 600 for each plasmid. The biotinylated EGF yielding the highest binding of molecular conjugates to EGFR was determined by radioactive competition binding. EGF was iodinated to a specific activity of 160,000 cpm/ng and separated from free iodine with a G-25 column. Cells were seeded at 100,000/35-mm tissue dish and grown overnight. Conjugates were generated with each biotin-EGF at a valency of 10. Duplicate cell samples were incubated in 1 ml of D/H/B (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with 1 nm125I-EGF plus conjugates containing 1 μg of DNA. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold WHIPS. The cells were then solubilized with 1 n NaOH, and the cell-associated radioactivity was counted. Biotin-EGF with the longest spacer arm was used for all other experiments. Cells were plated at 100,000/35-mm plate and grown overnight. Conjugates were then generated at valencies of 5, 15, and 50. Internalization experiments were conducted with these nonradiolabeled conjugates, as well as with 1 μg/ml EGF, as described above for radiolabeled complexes. At 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h, the medium was aspirated, and the remaining surface receptor number was quantified. Briefly, ligand was stripped from the surface with two 2-min washes with 1 ml of ice-cold acidic salt strip, and cells were then incubated in 50 nm125I-EGF in D/H/B for 3 h at 4 °C. Finally, the duplicate samples were washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold WHIPS, solubilized with 1n NaOH, and the radioactivity was counted. The efficiency of EGF biotinylation by one reagent, Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin, was tested by quantifying the binding of radiolabeled biotin-EGF to streptavidin-agarose. 96.2 ± 6.1% of the ligand bound to the gel, while the presence of 2 mm biotin reduced the binding to 4.8 ± 1.2%, where the error is the S.D. of two samples. Under these conditions, the reaction is therefore extremely efficient. The maximum binding capacity of the conjugates for biotin-EGF was then measured. We synthesized SA-pK at a ratio of 1.5 streptavidin molecules per polylysine chain. Conjugates were then generated at an electroneutral charge ratio and added in increasing amounts to 0.165 nmol of radiolabeled biotin-EGF. Biotin-EGF bound to conjugate samples containing 0, 10, 50, 100, and 200 ng of DNA was separated from free ligand, and the moles of bound biotin-EGF were plottedversus the moles of DNA added (data not shown). The data fit the linepmol bound EGF=0.13 pmol+63×pmol plasmid (R=0.99)(Eq. 1) The slope of the line indicates that 63 is the maximum valency, or average number of biotin-EGF molecules that can bind to each plasmid before the streptavidin becomes saturated. Conjugates were generated with various amounts of SA-pK complexed to a fixed amount of DNA, and the effect of the overall charge ratio of these preparations on gene delivery, binding, and internalization was determined. We conducted all experiments in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml free EGF to compare receptor-specificversus nonspecific charge interactions between the conjugates and cells. Fig. 1 shows that gene delivery is negligible at low lysine/nucleotide ratios. All error bars represent the standard deviations of duplicate samples. As the ratio reaches electroneutrality, however, gene transfer efficiency rises steeply in the sample without the excess EGF, reaching 28% at a charge ratio of 4. In the sample with excess ligand, gene transfer rises only for lysine/nucleotide ratios above 1.3, and gene transfer efficiency is statistically significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the samples without excess ligand for all charge ratios greater than 0.9. The same trends were observed in CV-1 cells (data not shown). To determine which step or steps of the gene delivery process can account for the dependence of efficiency on charge ratio, we quantified both conjugate cell surface binding and internalization as a function of lysine/nucleotide ratio. Radiolabeled conjugates were generated by adding a small amount of 125I-labeled SA-pK to conjugate preparations. The association between radiolabeled SA-pK and DNA was stable to the addition of a large excess of polylysine and under the conditions of the incubations with cells (data not shown). Cell binding was conducted in suspension to avoid the large nonspecific, background binding of conjugates to tissue culture plastic. After 3 h of agitation at 4 °C, cells were separated from free conjugate. Assuming the 125I-SA-pK was nearly equally distributed among all plasmids, the approximate number of bound plasmids per cell is plotted versus the lysine/nucleotide ratio in Fig. 2. Similar to the trend observed in gene delivery, binding both in the absence and presence of excess ligand rises with increasing charge ratio, from under 10,000 plasmids bound per cell at a lysine/nucleotide ratio of 0.5 to over 110,000 bound at a ratio of 4. The nonspecific binding is statistically significantly lower (p < 0.05) than the total binding only between lysine/nucleotide ratios of 0.9 and 1.3. The same preparations of radiolabeled conjugates were also incubated with adherent cells for 6 h to measure endocytosis. A pH 3, 2m NaCl wash removed >90% of the radioactivity bound to the cell surface and tissue culture plastic without compromising cell membranes (data not shown). Since chloroquine inhibits lysosomal degradation as well as EGFR recycling (20King A.C. Hernaez-Davis L. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3283-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Stoscheck C.M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), the internal counts represent the sum of all endocytosis over the 6 h experiment. The internalization curves, shown in Fig. 2, manifest the same trend as the binding curves, with internalization rising with increasing lysine/nucleotide ratios to a maximum of over 400,000/cell. Although the curves with and without excess ligand are statistically different (p < 0.05) at all points, the maximum differences occur near a ratio of 1, as with the binding experiment. To determine whether linking EGF to the molecular conjugate reduced its affinity for its receptor, presumably by sterically hindering their interaction, we generated and purified three different biotin-EGF molecules using biotinylation reagents with progressively longer spacer arms. Their ability to mediate specific conjugate binding to the EGFR and gene delivery was then evaluated. The three biotinylated EGF molecules were added at a valency of 10 to electroneutral conjugates, and their affinity for the EGF receptor was gauged by their ability to compete with radiolabeled EGF for binding to NR6 cells. The competition binding results, presented in Table I, are expressed as the percentage by which the binding of125I-EGF is reduced due to the presence of the conjugates, such that higher percentages indicate better conjugate binding. There is a correlation between spacer arm length and ability to compete in binding, indicating that longer spacer arms between biotin and EGF yield conjugates with a higher affinity for the EGF receptor. Conjugates containing EGF with the 30.5-Å arm reduced binding of 1 nm radiolabeled EGF by 91%, while ones with the 13.5-Å arm inhibited binding by only 10%. Gene transfer was then conducted, and at a valency of 10, increased binding improved gene delivery efficiency (Table I). The conjugates generated with the smallest linker had an efficiency of 2.3%, while the longest linker yielded an 18% efficiency. Therefore, extending the spacer arm between EGF and biotin improves cell surface binding and gene delivery efficiency at low valency.Table IEffects of EGF cross-linker spacer arm lengthCrosslinker nameSpacer arm lengthInhibition of EGF bindingGene transfer efficiencyÅ%%Sulfo-NHS-Biotin13.510.4 ± 5.82.3 ± 0.4Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin22.417.8 ± 5.56.9 ± 5.5Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin30.591.0 ± 0.518.0 ± 1.7To measure effects on specific conjugate binding to the EGFR, three biotin-EGF molecules were generated with increasing spacer arm lengths between the biotin and EGF, shown in the second column. Conjugates, generated with each biotin-EGF at a valency of 10, were assayed for binding to the EGFR and gene delivery.

Open table in a new tab To measure effects on specific conjugate binding to the EGFR, three biotin-EGF molecules were generated with increasing spacer arm lengths between the biotin and EGF, shown in the second column. Conjugates, generated with each biotin-EGF at a valency of 10, were assayed for binding to the EGFR and gene delivery. In a competition experiment, the percentage by which the binding of free 125I-EGF to cells was reduced due to the presence of the conjugate is shown in the third column. The percentage of cells expressing GFP after gene transfer by each is shown in the fourth column. Conjugates at a lysine/nucleotide ratio of 1 were generated, and varying amounts of biotin-EGF with the longest spacer arm were added. Fig. 3 shows that the gene transfer efficiency rises sharply at low valencies, peaks at 18% between a valency of 10 and 20, and then declines to below 2.5% between 20 and 50. The same trend was observed in CV-1 cells (data not shown). To investigate what could account for this behavior, binding and internalization experiments were conducted with varying valencies, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. Binding and internalization are both maximal at the same valencies as gene delivery, between 10 and 20, with binding peaking at 72,000 plasmids per cell and internalization at 137,000.Figure 4Conjugate binding and internalization as a function of conjugate valency. Conjugate binding and internalization by NR6 cells was investigated using conjugates generated with various valencies, or biotin-EGF/plasmid ratios. Experiments were conducted as in Fig. 2, and the number of plasmids bound (•) and internalized (○) per cell is plotted as a function of valency.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reduced binding, internalization, and delivery at higher valencies could potentially be due to steric hindrance between multiple biotin-EGF proteins bound to the same streptavidin. To address this possibility, we measured binding of conjugates at an EGF valency of 15 in the presence of a large excess of biotinylated aprotonin, which is of similar size to EGF, to saturate unoccupied streptavidin sites. The presence of biotin-aprotonin made no statistically significant difference in conjugate binding to cells (data not shown). Therefore, steric interference between multiple biotin-EGF molecules likely does not account for the observed drops in delivery, binding, and internalization at high valency. Another possibility that could explain the reduction in conjugate binding observed at higher valencies is that the receptors become saturated. Multiplying valency by the number of plasmids bound per cell shows that, at valencies of 15 or greater, there are roughly one million EGF molecules attached to conjugates bound to each cell. Even if only a fraction of the conjugate surface area is close enough to the cell membrane for the ligands to bind, at valencies of 15 and above they likely occupy nearly all the approximately 380,000 receptors per cell (see below). Therefore, as valency increases and each conjugate binds a larger number of the receptors, the number of bound conjugates decreases. The reduction in the number of conjugates bound at high valencies may lead to reduced conjugate internalization and gene delivery. If conjugates of higher valencies occupy nearly all the surface receptors, then the specific receptor-mediated endocytosis is likely saturated, as has been observed in NR6 and other cells at higher levels of EGF receptor occupancy (22Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,23Starbuck C. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1990; 45: 2367-2373Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). With endocytosis saturated, the cells would be specifically internalizing the highest number of receptors possible, but at high valencies, each conjugate binds to a large number of these receptors. Therefore, as valency is increased the fixed, saturated flux of receptors into the cell would be able to carry along progressively fewer conjugates. To test the possibility that conjugates saturate receptor internalization at higher valencies, cells were incubated with conjugates of valency 5, 15, or 50, or with 165 nm EGF, for various times up to 6 h. The ligand was then stripped from the cell surface, and the remaining number of surface EGFR was measured. A saturating level of free EGF should lead to the maximum potential rate of receptor internalization. In addition, the presence of chloroquine inhibits EGFR recycling after endocytosis (20King A.C. Hernaez-Davis L. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3283-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Stoscheck C.M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar); therefore, the rate of disappearance of cell surface EGF receptor due to the presence of 1 μg/ml EGF plus 100 μm chloroquine should theoretically be the maximum possible surface receptor down-regulation rate. Fig. 5 shows that, with excess free EGF, the surface receptor number decreases approximately linearly from 380,000/cell to 180,000/cell by 6 h, or only 43 ± 5.5% of its original value, where the error is the S.D.s of two samples. At a conjugate valency of 5, receptors are down-regulated to only 71 ± 3.4%, or 270,000 receptors/cell. However, at valencies of 15 and 50, EGF receptors are down-regulated to 40 ± 1.8% and 42 ± 8.4% of their original levels. The receptor down-regulation due to conjugates at valencies of 15 and 50 is not statistically distinguishable from that observed for free EGF. We have investigated whether polyplex interactions with the cell surface can be a rate-limiting step for gene delivery, and if so, whether this barrier can be overcome to improve gene delivery efficiency. We focused on three conjugate parameters that could potentially affect binding to the cell, the lysine/nucleotide ratio, the cross-linker used to attach the ligand, and the number of ligands added per plasmid. The effects of these properties on cell surface binding, internalization, and gene delivery have been examined. For these studies, we employ an experimental system that uses EGF to direct delivery of plasmid DNA encoding GFP to mouse fibroblasts stably expressing the human EGFR. Zeta potential measurements show that adding increasing amounts of polycation to a fixed amount of DNA changes the surface charge of polyplexes from negative, through electroneutral, to positive (24Wolfert M.A. Schacht E.H. Toncheva V. Ulbrich K. Nazarova O. Seymour L.W. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 25Legendre J.Y. Trzeciak A. Bohrmann B. Deuschle U. Kitas E. Supersaxo A. Bioconjug. Chem. 1997; 8: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The electropositive conjugates nonspecifically bind to the negatively charged cell surface, likely due to interactions with proteoglycans (17Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Therefore, if specific, receptor-mediated gene delivery is desired, it is important to know precisely how this nonspecific binding depends on conjugate charge. The effects of the lysine/nucleotide ratio have been examined in other systems, and increasing the proportion of polycation increases overall gene delivery (4Sosnowski B.A. Gonzalez A.M. Chandler L.A. Buechler Y.J. Pierce G.F. Baird A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33647-33653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 26Wagner E. Zenke M. Cotten M. Beug H.

Chem. 1995; 6: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the interpretation in most cases is complicated by the fact that as more cross-linked ligand-polylysine was added to the DNA, the number of ligands increased along with the charge ratio. In addition, the contributions of receptor-ligand versus nonspecific ionic interactions to gene delivery were not resolved. We measured the relative contributions of specific and nonspecific interactions between conjugates and cells to binding, internalization, and gene delivery as a function of the lysine/nucleotide ratio. Binding and internalization increased as the lysine/nucleotide ratio was increased from 0.5 to 4, as shown in Fig. 2. The internalization curves are steeper than the binding curves because, with inhibition of recycling and degradation by chloroquine, they represent an accumulation of binding and internalization events over the 6 h. The curves in the absence and presence of excess free ligand are similar at all charge ratios except near a lysine/nucleotide ratio of 1. Below this ratio, regardless of the presence of biotin-EGF, the negatively charged conjugates are probably ionically repelled by the cell membrane or not sufficiently condensed to be internalized. Conjugates generated at a ratio greater than 1 likely nonspecifically adsorb to the surface, again independent of biotin-EGF. Only between ratios of 0.9 and 1.3, where charge effects are likely at a minimum, are receptor-mediated binding and internalization larger than the nonspecific contributions. Our results are consistent with the zeta potential measurements of Wolfert et al. (24Wolfert M.A. Schacht E.H. Toncheva V. Ulbrich K. Nazarova O. Seymour L.W. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), who show that their polylysine molecular conjugates have a neutral surface charge at a lysine/nucleotide ratio of approximately 1.2. Even electroneutral complexes, however, have surprisingly significant nonspecific binding and internalization. Gene transfer efficiency as a function of charge ratio, shown in Fig. 1, follows similar trends to binding and internalization; delivery is always negligible at low ratios, and nonspecific delivery increases at high ratios. However, in contrast to binding and internalization, at ratios above 1 gene delivery is always much higher when receptor-ligand interactions are not blocked, a result that implies that receptor-ligand binding may play an important role even after entry into the cell. One possible explanation for the observation is that conjugates bound to EGF receptors are sorted differently within endosomes, since it is known that ligands undergo different endosomal trafficking fates depending on whether they remain associated with the EGFR (28French A.R. Tadaki D.K. Niyogi S.K. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4334-4340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Alternatively, there are numerous reports of EGFR translocation to the cell nucleus in a number of cell types including NR6 cells, so it is conceivable that the receptor could facilitate nuclear delivery of conjugates (29Jiang L.-W. Schindler M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Marti U. Burwen S.J. Wells A. Barker M.E. Huling S. Feren A.M. Jones A.L.

Inman C.B. Davies D.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In any case, however, if highly receptor-specific gene delivery is desired, even at the expense of efficiency, then conjugates must be generated close to electroneutrality. We have also investigated the effects of the overall affinity of polyplexes for a cell surface receptor on gene delivery. This affinity can be altered in two ways, by changing the properties of individual ligands, or by varying the number of ligands present per conjugate. We found that lengthening the cross-linker arm used to tether EGF to the conjugate significantly enhances the specific binding of conjugates to the EGFR. The nonspecific binding, determined by the conjugate charge, should not be affected by the cross-linker. Biotin dimers cross-link streptavidin only when the two biotins are separated by at least 23 Å (33Wilbur D.S. Pathare P.M. Hamlin D.K. Weerawarna S.A. Bioconjug. Chem. 1997; 8: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), so that we would expect that the minimum spacer length for effective attachment of biotin-EGF to the conjugates is 11.5 Å. All spacers we used are longer, so the additional space may provide the flexibility required for EGF to bind to its receptor in the correct orientation. This improved binding with longer spacers translates into more efficient gene delivery at low valency. The result that increasing spacer arm length significantly improves binding and gene expression has also been observed with retargeted retroviral vectors displaying ligands fused to an envelope glycoprotein (34Valsesia-Wittmann S. Morling F.J. Nilson B.H.K. Takeuchi Y. Russell S.J. Cosset F.-L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ager S. Nilson B.H. Morling F.J. Peng K.W. Cosset F.L. Russell S.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 2157-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). While the results with different cross-linkers showed that increasing affinity at low valency improves gene delivery, the biphasic dependence of gene delivery on valency demonstrated that increasing affinity too high actually significantly hampers gene delivery. At low valency, inefficient conjugate binding results in low internalization and gene delivery. Increasing valency improves binding, internalization, and delivery to an optimum at a valency near 15. Further valency increases, however, lead to a rapid decrease in all three curves and an 8-fold drop in efficiency. Binding likely decreases because, from valencies of 15–50, nearly all the 380,000 EGF receptors may be occupied. This conclusion is supported by our earlier analysis that for valencies of 15 or greater the number of biotin-EGF molecules attached to the conjugates bound to each cell roughly plateaus near 1 million. In addition, conjugates of valency 15 reduce the binding of 1 nm radiolabeled EGF by as much as 91% (Table I). With the receptors saturated, increasing the number of ligands per plasmid only decreases the number of conjugates that can bind each cell. If a high number of EGF receptors is occupied, then EGF receptor-mediated endocytosis becomes saturated, meaning that the rate of receptor internalization reaches a maximum. Endocytic saturation, which occurs at an EGFR occupancy of 50,000 to 100,000 for NR6 cells, 2J. Haugh, personal communication. is probable with higher valency conjugates. To test this possibility, we monitored the disappearance of EGFR from the cell surface. Conjugates of valency 5 down-regulate the EGFR by only 29% over 6 h. In contrast, conjugates of valency 15 and 50 down-regulate the receptor by over 65%, the same result observed with 165 nm free EGF. Therefore, conjugates of valency 15 already drive the highest rate of receptor endocytosis, so increasing valency further only decreases the number of plasmids carried inside the cell by the fixed number of receptors internalized. In summary, at low valency, receptors are inefficiently utilized because not enough are occupied and internalized, and at high valency, receptors are inefficiently utilized because each conjugate binds too many. This finding should be relevant not only to molecular conjugates, but also to other targeted gene delivery systems such as immunoliposomes or engineered viral vectors where the valency can be varied, particularly when a high affinity ligand such as a growth factor or antibody is employed (36Maruyama K.

These experiments show that binding to the cell surface is a barrier to gene transfer, and that the conjugate can be engineered to increase efficiency and specificity. We find there is a relatively narrow window of charge ratios in which the receptor-specific is significantly greater than the nonspecific binding, internalization, and delivery. In addition, there is an optimal conjugate-receptor affinity for gene delivery. At low valency, affinity is insufficient for effective binding and internalization. However, increasing valency beyond the optimum significantly decreases gene delivery due to saturation of binding and internalization. These fundamental results of this model system can potentially be applied to other targeted synthetic or viral gene delivery systems. In summary, a quantitative examination of the mechanism of receptor-mediated gene delivery can yield improvements in gene transfer efficiency and specificity. We thank Rachael L. Neve for helpful discussions."

https://openalex.org/W2006725938,"Serpentine Gαi-linked receptors support rapid adhesion and directed migration of leukocytes and other cell types. The intracellular mechanisms mediating and regulating chemoattractant-directed adhesion and locomotion are only now beginning to be explored. RGS (for regulator ofG-protein signaling) proteins are a recently described family that regulate Gαi-stimulated pathways by acting as GTPase-activating proteins. Little is known about the GTPase activity of the Gαi proteins involved in adhesion and chemotaxis, or the significance of their regulation to these responses. Using transiently transfected lymphoid cells as a model system, we show that expression of RGS1, RGS3, and RGS4 inhibits chemoattractant-induced migration. In contrast, RGS2, a regulator of Gαq activity, had no effect on cell migration to any chemoattractant. RGS1, RGS3, and RGS4 also reduced rapid chemoattractant-triggered adhesion, although the proadhesive response appears quantitatively less sensitive to RGS action than chemotaxis. The results suggest that the duration of the Gαi signal may be a particularly important parameter in the chemotactic responses of leukocytes, and demonstrate the potential for RGS family members to regulate cellular adhesive and migratory behaviors. Serpentine Gαi-linked receptors support rapid adhesion and directed migration of leukocytes and other cell types. The intracellular mechanisms mediating and regulating chemoattractant-directed adhesion and locomotion are only now beginning to be explored. RGS (for regulator ofG-protein signaling) proteins are a recently described family that regulate Gαi-stimulated pathways by acting as GTPase-activating proteins. Little is known about the GTPase activity of the Gαi proteins involved in adhesion and chemotaxis, or the significance of their regulation to these responses. Using transiently transfected lymphoid cells as a model system, we show that expression of RGS1, RGS3, and RGS4 inhibits chemoattractant-induced migration. In contrast, RGS2, a regulator of Gαq activity, had no effect on cell migration to any chemoattractant. RGS1, RGS3, and RGS4 also reduced rapid chemoattractant-triggered adhesion, although the proadhesive response appears quantitatively less sensitive to RGS action than chemotaxis. The results suggest that the duration of the Gαi signal may be a particularly important parameter in the chemotactic responses of leukocytes, and demonstrate the potential for RGS family members to regulate cellular adhesive and migratory behaviors. regulator of G-protein signaling C5a receptor chemoattractant receptor formyl peptide receptor synthetic N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe GTPase-activating protein green fluorescent protein interleukin-8 monocyte chemoattractant protein phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fluorescence-activated cell sorting polymerase chain reaction bovine serum albumin Hanks' buffered saline solution G-protein-gated inward rectifier K+. Cell migration is a required behavior in the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms. During embryonic development, epithelial cell migration occurs at the gastrulation stage, and neural crest cell migration is required to form the developing nervous system. The axonal growth cones of elongating nerves detect and migrate in response to various chemoattractants and chemorepellents in the surrounding environment as they are directed toward their precise target. In the adult, movement of fibroblasts into areas of injury plays an important role in wound repair, and the migration of endothelial cells performs a paramount role during angiogenesis. Leukocytes are recruited to sites of inflammation, and, during normal immune surveillance, lymphocytes migrate from the blood into various microenvironments of lymphatic organs whereupon they encounter antigen presenting cells that stimulate the lymphocytes' effector functions and promote a more potent immune response. Although much is known concerning the motor that drives cell migration (actin assembly and disassembly) (1Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 2Zigmond S.H. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), the cellular signal transduction pathways that coordinate these processes in the context of cell movement are largely undefined. In addition to pro-migratory stimuli (chemokinesis), chemoattractants also provide a directional signal to cells leading to migration toward the source of the chemoattractant (chemotaxis). In the case of leukocytes, chemoattractants direct migration from the bloodstream into organized lymphoid organs and into inflamed tissues (3Butcher E.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1033-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar, 4Butcher E.C. Picker L.J. Science. 1996; 272: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar, 5Mackay C.R. J.

Subsequently, they may target lymphocytes into specialized microenvironmental niches within lymphoid organs (4Butcher E.C. Picker L.J. Science. 1996; 272: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar). Similarly, myeloid cells in inflamed tissues can be directed toward the invading organism via the interaction of host-derived and target-derived chemoattractants (7Kitayama J. Carr M.W. Roth S.J. Buccola J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2340-2349PubMed Google Scholar, 8Campbell J.J. Foxman E.F. Butcher E.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2571-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Foxman E.F. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Chemoattractants also can direct the rapid, integrin-dependent adhesion of leukocytes to various cell-associated or extracellular proteins if the corresponding chemoattractant receptor is expressed at high levels (10Campbell J.J. Qin S. Bacon K.B. Mackay C.R. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The number of identified leukocyte chemoattractants has exploded in the past years with the addition of many newly cloned chemokines (chemoattractant cytokines) to the list of “classical” chemoattractants such as formyl peptides, C5a, and leukotriene B4. Most leukocyte chemoattractants mediate their activity by binding and stimulating specific Gαi-coupled receptors (11Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 12Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). Chemoattractant binding to receptor facilitates the receptor-coupled Gαi subunit exchange of bound GDP for GTP, and subsequent dissociation of Gαi from the receptor and the βγ heterodimer. The active GTP-bound Gαi subunit and the released βγ heterodimer can then stimulate their respective effector pathways. Recent studies suggest that βγ-mediated signaling is critical to the chemotactic response (13Arai H. Tsou C.L. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14495-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The Gαi subunit has an intrinsic GTPase activity that converts the active GTP-bound form back to the inactive GDP-bound form. GDP-bound Gαi reassociates with the βγ heterodimer to complete the cycle and turn off the G-protein-stimulated signal(s) (15Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Importantly, little is known as yet about the duration of the stimulated G-protein response to chemoattractants (16Hall A.L. Wilson B.S. Pfeiffer J.R. Oliver J.M. Sklar L.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), let alone about the importance of this to proadhesive versus migratory behaviors of the cell. Sophisticated mechanisms exist, however, to modify cellular responses through G-protein coupled receptors. Treatment with a chemoattractant can render the cell less responsive to subsequent stimulation by the same agonist, a process to which homologous receptor phosphorylation and desensitization can contribute (17Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with some attractants can also render a cell less responsive to subsequent treatment with agonists that bind different receptors, a process that can be mediated by heterologous receptor desensitization (17Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar), heterologous receptor sequestration (18Sabroe I. Williams T.J. Hebert C.A. Collins P.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1361-1369PubMed Google Scholar), or, potentially, inhibition of downstream machinery. Both homologous and heterologous cross-talk between agonists and their receptors can help control and target leukocyte migration to chemoattractants (7Kitayama J. Carr M.W. Roth S.J. Buccola J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2340-2349PubMed Google Scholar, 8Campbell J.J. Foxman E.F. Butcher E.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2571-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Foxman E.F. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Recently, a distinct molecular mechanism with the potential to modulate G-protein responses has been discovered. Genetic evidence from mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (19Dohlman H.G. Apaniesk D. Chen Y. Song J. Nusskern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), Caenorhabditis elegans (20Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans (21Yu J.H. Wieser J. Adams T.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5184-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) suggested that a group of proteins with a common domain, the RGS1 (forregulator of G-protein signaling) domain (20Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 22Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), can directly control aspects of G-protein-stimulated signaling pathways. RGS proteins appear to enhance the endogenous GTPase activity of G-proteins, thus decreasing the half-life of the active GTP-bound state and limiting the duration of Gαisignaling. At least 19 mammalian RGS members have been identified (23Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Many RGS members have been shown to bind to Gαi proteins and activate the Gαi subunit's intrinsic GTPase activity in in vitro biochemical assays. Although only few in vivo studies have been performed in mammalian cells, these studies have suggested that RGS proteins can regulate Gβγ-mediated events such as G-protein-gated inward rectifier K+ (GIRK) channels (24Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 25Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) as well as Gαi-stimulated responses. Inhibition of βγ signaling by RGS proteins may reflect GDP-bound Gαi reassociation with and hence sequestration of free active βγ heterodimers. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that RGS proteins might also regulate cellular migratory and proadhesive responses to chemoattractants. It is not apparent, however, whether to expect that RGS proteins would stimulate or inhibit chemotaxis and adhesion responses. RGS4 and RGS8 have unexpectedly been shown to stimulate rather than inhibit the opening of GIRK channels in Xenopusoocytes following the addition of acetylcholine or dopamine. Subsequent to the increased conductance through these channels, RGS4 and RGS8 also stimulated the rapid closure of the same channels following agonist removal (24Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 25Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies of light-stimulated rhodopsin/transducin signaling clearly indicate that certain cellular responses (e.g. the amplitude of light-induced membrane depolarization) are regulated not by the duration of the G-protein signal, but rather by the rate of receptor desensitization, a G-protein-independent process (26Sagoo M.S. Lagnado L. Nature. 1997; 389: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, if and how RGS proteins regulate proadhesive and migratory responses must depend on the dynamics of the signaling pathways involved, and must be assessed experimentally. This study was undertaken to address this issue using lymphoid cell responses to classical chemoattractants and chemokines as a model. The results suggest that regulation of the GTPase activity can significantly influence the migratory and adhesive response to chemoattractants and demonstrate the potential for RGS control of chemoattractant-directed cell motility. The cDNAs for human FLAGged formyl peptide receptor (fPR) (27Boulay F. Tardif M. Brouchon L. Vignais P.

Mackay C.R. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). “FLAG” epitope addition to the N terminus of these receptors does not affect the binding of their corresponding agonist nor their subsequent responses (10Campbell J.J. Qin S. Bacon K.B. Mackay C.R. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The L1/2.2 line was derived by transient transfection of the parental L1–2 cells with a chemoattractant receptor and selecting for the cells that migrated to ligand. The migrated cells were expanded (losing receptor expression in the process) and the cycle repeated once more to generate the L1/2.2 line. The L1/2*CXCR1/CCR-2B cell line was developed as follows. L1–2 cells were stably transfected with the FLAGged CXCR1 as described in Ref. 10Campbell J.J. Qin S. Bacon K.B. Mackay C.R. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, FACS sorted for high expression using the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M1, and selected for functional expression of the receptor by chemotaxis to interleukin-8 (IL-8) (32Walz A. Peveri P. Aschauer H. Baggiolini M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 33Yoshimura T. Matsushima K. Tanaka S. Robinson E.A. Appella E. Oppenheim J.J. Leonard E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9233-9237Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the CXCR1-positive cells were stably transfected with FLAGged CCR-2B and cells with functional levels of receptor obtained by chemotaxis of the double transfectants to the CCR-2B ligand, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) (34Yoshimura T. Robinson E.A. Tanaka S. Appella E. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1956-1962PubMed Google Scholar). The L1/2*fPR/CXCR1 cell line was developed in an analogous way as the L1/2*CXCR1/CCR-2B cell line. The cDNAs for RGS1, RGS2, and RGS3 encoded within pRC-CMV and RGS4 encoded within pCR3 (Invitrogen) have been described previously (22Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The RGS4N88S mutant was made by annealing primers containing the appropriate mutation (AAT to AGT) to the pCR3 vector containing RGS4, performing 12 cycles of PCR and then digesting the starting vector withDpnI according to manufacturer's instructions enclosed in the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Clones were isolated that had lost the unique SspI site in RGS4 following mutagenesis and were sequenced to confirm that there were no additional mutations. pGreen Lantern was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and contains a “humanized” GFP gene with a S65T mutation. FMLP and recombinant human C5a was purchased from Sigma. IL-8 was a generous gift from Sandoz Forschungsinstitut (Vienna, Austria), and MCP-1 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). L1/2.2, L1/2*CXCR1/CCR-2B, and L1/2*fPR/CXCR1 cells grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 500 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Growth Medium) were harvested by centrifugation after reaching >3 × 106 cells/ml (post-logarithmic growth). Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 at 1.0–1.5 × 108/ml and 0.8 ml of cells transferred to an Electro Chamber (0.4-cm gap, Life Technologies, Inc.). The DNAs to be co-transfected were mixed in a sterile microcentrifuge tube, brought to 137 mm NaCl, and 500 μg of yeast tRNA (Boehringer Mannheim) in phosphate-buffered saline added. The DNA mixture was added to cuvette, mixed by inversion, and allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were electroporated at 310 V/1180 microfarads using a Cell-PORATOR (Life Technologies, Inc.). After electroporation, cells were allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 min and then diluted into 5–7 ml of Growth Medium and incubated at 37 °C and 8% CO2 for 5–6 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.7 ml of Growth Medium, and layered on top of 0.7 ml of Histopaque 1119 (Sigma) in a microcentrifuge tube. The cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 30 min at room temperature. Viable cells were harvested from the interface, washed in Growth Medium, and incubated overnight in Growth Medium containing 2 mm sodium butyrate (Sigma) to maximize the expression of proteins transcribed from the cytomegalovirus promoter (35Palermo D.P. DeGraaf M.E. Marotti K.R. Rehberg E. Post L.E. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 19: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and to increase the cells' intrinsic migratory capacity if they were to be used for most chemotaxis assays. Cells were not incubated with sodium butyrate if they were transfected with any of the GFP-RGS chimeras since the GFP intensity was a direct measure of RGS expression and there was no need to maximize the expression of the GFP-RGS chimeras. 5 × 105 cells were stained with the mouse anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody (IBI, New Haven, CT) or isotype control antibody (MOPC-141, Sigma) at 3 μg/ml for 1 h on ice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma), 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.1% NaN3. Cells were washed and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h on ice at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Cells were analyzed on a FACScan using Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% BSA (Fraction V) was CO2-equilibrated overnight. The following day, agonists were resuspended in RPMI/BSA to the indicated concentration and 0.6 ml were aliquoted into a 24-well plate (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA). The plates were returned to the CO2 incubator to re-equilibrate for >1 h. L1/2 cells transiently transfected the previous day were harvested and washed once in RPMI/BSA. The cells were resuspended in RPMI/BSA at 1.0 × 107/ml. Transwell cell culture chamber inserts (polycarbonate 5-μm pore size, Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) were placed in the wells containing agonist, and 100 μl of cells (1.0 × 106) were added to each transwell. The cells were allowed to migrate through the porous bottom for 4 h at 37 °C. The transwell inserts were removed, and the number of migrated cells was counted by mixing with a known number of polystyrene beads (15 μm, Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) and analyzing the ratio of cells to beads on the FACScan as described previously (10Campbell J.J. Qin S. Bacon K.B. Mackay C.R. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Dead cells, displaying decreased forward scatter and propidium iodide uptake, were eliminated from all analysis. For quantitative analysis, 15 μg of whole cell lysate and increasing amounts of His6-RGS2 (kindly provided by David Siderovski, Amgen Institute, Toronto, Canada) or glutathioneS-transferase-RGS3 were separated on an 11% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blocked overnight in WB buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2) containing 5% nonfat dried milk. The blots were washed twice for 10 min each with WB buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (WBT), incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-RGS2 (1:400) or anti-RGS3 (1:800) antiserum (22Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) for 1 h in WBT, washed twice with WBT for 10 min each, and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) at a 1:500 dilution for 1 h in WBT. The blots were then washed extensively in WBT three to four times for 10 min each, then washed twice with 25 mm diethanolamine, pH 9.5, 300 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2 for 10 min each. Bound antibodies were detected using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate or the chemiluminescent substrate CDP-Star (NEN Life Science Products) and visualized with Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantification of immunoreactive band intensity was performed by comparison to known quantities of His6-RGS2 and glutathioneS-transferase-RGS3 probed side by side. The quantification was performed on a LKB Bromma UltroScan XL enhanced laser densiometer using GelScan XL software (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden). For qualitative analysis, whole cell lysate was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred, and blocked as described above. The blot was incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antiserum (CLONTECH) at a 1:2000 dilution. The blot was developed as described above. Agonist-activated adhesion was performed as described in Ref. 10Campbell J.J. Qin S. Bacon K.B. Mackay C.R. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar with the following modifications. 16 μl of cells were allowed to settle onto the VCAM-1-coated well for 7 min. Following addition of 4 μl of 500 nm FMLP and incubation for 4 min, the slides were inverted into a coupling jar with ice-cold HBSS, 10 mmHepes, pH 7.4. After allowing the non-adherent cells to fall off the slide for 3 min, the slide was removed and re-inverted onto a cold metal block to prevent drying while other slides in the group were being handled. 20 μl of HBSS (without divalent cations) ,10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 0.5% BSA (Fraction V) (Recovery Medium) containing approximately 10,000 polystyrene beads (15 μm, Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) were aliquoted into each well containing adherent cells. The slide was placed in a humidified chamber at room temperature to prevent drying until all adhesion assays were performed. The adherent cells and beads were resuspended by repetitive pipetting and transferred to a polypropylene FACS tube containing 200 μl of Growth Medium. The well was washed with 20 μl of Recovery Medium without beads and combined with the first wash. A “100% adhesion” control was made by transferring 16 μl of cells and 20 μl of Recovery Medium containing beads directly into a FACS tube. The number of adherent cells and their GFP intensity was counted by analyzing the ratio of cells to beads on the FACScan as described previously (10Campbell J.J. Qin S. Bacon K.B. Mackay C.R. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). PMA-stimulated adhesion was performed as described above except 4 μl of 1 μm PMA was added to the cells and incubated for 30 min before the slide was inverted into ice-cold HBSS, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. RGS family members were tagged by fusing them by their N termini with an enhanced GFP mutant. Fusion of sequences to the N termini of RGS members have previously been shown not to inhibit RGS function (36De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The full-length sequence of different RGS members were PCR-amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and primers containing a KpnI site. The resulting PCR products were cut using KpnI and cloned non-directionally into the KpnI site of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) by standard techniques. Vector clones with the correct orientation were tested for their ability to regulate L1/2 migration to chemoattractants. Selected clones were linearized with ApaLI, transfected into L1/2*fPR (47Honda S. Campbell J.J. Andrew D.P. Engelhardt B. Butcher B.A. Warnock R.A. Ye R.D. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4026-4035PubMed Google Scholar) using the transfection method detailed above, and placed under G418 selection to obtain stable transfectants. Individual clones of L1/2 cells stably transfected with GFP, GFP-RGS1, GFP-RGS2, and GFP-RGS3 were obtained by limiting dilution. Clones with similar GFP expression levels were selected for further confocal microscopy analysis. The subcellular distribution of the different GFP-tagged RGS members was analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics MultiProbe 2010 laser scanning confocal microscope, a 60× oil-immersion lens, and ImageSpace software. The displayed slices were obtained from the middle of the cells. The nucleus was localized by incubating cells for 1.5 h in 5 μm SYTO-59 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and washing. To examine the effects of RGS proteins, we developed a procedure for efficient transient transfection of the pre-B L1–2 cell, an Abelson virus transformed C57L/J lymphoma (48Witte O.N. Rosenberg N.

Importantly, co-transfected vectors are taken up together and coordinately expressed in this system. For example, Fig. 1 illustrates correlated expression of transfected FLAGged CXCR1 (the experimental gene in this example) and GFP (the marker gene). As shown in Fig. 1 d, the cells that express CXCR1 also express GFP, demonstrating efficient co-transfection of the two vector-encoded genes (most transfected cells are in upper right quadrant, i.e. double expressors). Moreover, except at the lowest levels of expression, there is a positive correlation between the expression of the two transfected genes; thus, the level of GFP expression can be used as an indicator of the relative expression from a co-transfected vector. In preliminary experiments to assess the effects of RGS proteins on chemotaxis, L1/2.2 cells were co-transfected with an RGS3-encoding vector and vectors encoding FLAGged fPR, C5aR, or CXCR1. RGS3 is a RGS family member originally isolated from a B-cell cDNA library (22Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H.

These chimeric STATs share a number of properties with wild-type Stat1, including a predominately cytoplasmic pattern of expression in unstimulated cells. Upon stimulation with ligand, the chimeric STATs rapidly become tyrosine-phosphorylated, dimerize, and are able to bind DNA. They are also able to heterodimerize with coexpressed wild-type Stat1. Yet in contrast to wild-type Stat1, the chimeric STATs exhibit a marked defect in deactivation. Moreover, the persistence of active chimeras correlates directly with an inability to translocate to the nucleus. The defects both in nuclear translocation and in deactivation are rescued by heterodimerization with coexpressed wild-type Stat1. This study indicates that STAT amino termini provide a signal that is important for nuclear translocation and, subsequently, deactivation.

Cytokines mediate their pleiotropic effects on cells by binding to specific transmembrane-spanning receptors. These receptors transduce signals into the cell, culminating in the induction of new genes. Characterization of the ability of IFNs1 to rapidly induce new genes has led to the elucidation of the JAK-STAT (signaltransducer and activator oftranscription) signaling pathway, which is now known to transduce signals for other cytokines as well (1Schindler C.

Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 61-84Google Scholar). JAKs are receptor-associated tyrosine kinases that mediate ligand-dependent receptor phosphorylation. Receptor phosphotyrosyl residues are, in turn, specifically recognized by the SH2 domain of members of the STAT family of cytoplasmic transcription factors (3Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G.

Activated STATs are released from the receptor and then heterodimerize through the interaction between the phosphotyrosine of one STAT and the SH2 domain of another STAT (6Chen X. Winkemeier U.

Sequence comparison of these STATs has led to the identification of several well conserved domains, the most highly conserved of which is the SH2 domain (7Gupta S. Yan H. Wong L.H. Ralph S.

Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Carboxyl-terminal to this domain is the tyrosine that becomes activated in response to ligand and subsequently mediates dimerization (10Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 14Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1743-1744Crossref Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 15Improta T.

Amino-terminal to this domain, but separated by an ∼80-amino acid linker region, is the DNA-binding domain (6Chen X. Winkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 9Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.W. Science. 1998; 394: 145-151Google Scholar, 16Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). There are several additional conserved amino-terminal domains whose structures suggest they may mediate interactions with other proteins. Of these, the first ∼100 amino acids are most conserved. Recent structural and functional studies suggest that this domain promotes cooperativity of DNA binding by mediating an interaction between two STAT dimers (6Chen X. Winkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 9Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.W.

As expected, mutagenesis of an invariant tryptophan (Trp-37 for Stat1) that is critical for this interaction abrogates cooperativity in DNA binding (18Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell J.E. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Mutation of another highly conserved residue in this interaction domain (Arg-31) has been shown to correlate with persistent tyrosine phosphorylation (19Shuai K. Liao J. Song M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although the structure of this region does not support a role for Arg-31 in mediating an interaction with a phosphatase, as initially argued, these observations do suggest that the amino-terminal domain is likely to serve an important regulatory function(s) in addition to cooperativity of DNA binding. To determine whether these highly conserved amino-terminal domains are functionally conserved and to evaluate the possibility that they may participate in other aspects of STAT signaling, chimeric STATs were generated. As anticipated, when the amino terminus of Stat1 (amino acids 1–129) was replaced with the homologous regions of Stat2 or Stat5, many functional properties were conserved. However, these chimeras exhibited a marked defect in nuclear translocation and deactivation. Chimeric receptors were generated by introducing DNA encoding amino acids 437–518 from the endodomain and transmembrane domain of the human IFN-α receptor α-chain (20Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2082-2974Google Scholar) into RcCMV (Invitrogen) encoding the 2200-base pair ectodomain of the human G-CSF receptor (21Ziegler S.P. Bird T.A. Morella K.K. Mosley B. Gearing D.P. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2384-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides encoding the Stat1-binding/recruitment site (TSFGYDKPHV) from the human interferon-γ receptor α-chain (5Greenlund A.L. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and a triple Myc tag (3Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) were added to the 3′-end of the receptor chimera to yield the mature construct G/aRα. The CH2/1 construct was generated by introducing a polymerase chain reaction product encoding amino acids 1–140 of Stat2, through blunt end cloning, into an RcCMV-based expression construct encoding amino acids 130–750 of Stat1. Similarly, the STAT CH5/1 construct was prepared by the introduction of a polymerase chain reaction product encoding amino acids 1–129 of Stat5b into the same Stat1 expression construct (i.e. amino acids 130–750). Each of these constructs was confirmed by sequencing. The generation of ΔNStat1 (amino acids 135–750) has been previously described (22Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J.

The human kidney fibroblast cell line 293 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transfection, 293 cells were pretreated for 5 min with 25 mm chloroquine (Sigma) and then transfected with 10 μg of the STAT constructs and 10 μg of G/aRα by the calcium phosphate method (23Pear E.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). After 24 h, transfected cells were reseeded and, after another 24 h, stimulated with human recombinant G-CSF (250 ng/ml; Amgen) or IFN-α (1000 units/ml; Genentech). As indicated, in some studies, staurosporine (dissolved in Me2SO; Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 500 nm. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out with an IRF1 GAS probe (gatcGATTTCCCCGAAAT; Oligos Etc.) as described previously (24Bonni A. Frank D.A. Schindler C. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1575-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 25Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 26Rothman P.

Cytoplasmic, nuclear, or whole cell extracts (WCEs) were made as reported previously (10Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 25Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 27Eilers A. Seegert D.

For supershifts, 0.6 μl of anti-STAT antibodies were added to a standard DNA binding reaction (12.5 μl for 20 min at 25 °C) and incubated at 4 °C for an additional hour prior to EMSA. In some studies, cytoplasmic extracts were treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (Buffer 2, New England Biolabs Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C prior to evaluation by EMSA. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (28Azam M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C. Tempst P. Ihle J.N. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates were fractionated by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the following: a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), a Myc epitope-specific antibody (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a Tyk2-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or STAT-specific antibodies. STAT-specific antibodies included those recognizing the amino terminus of Stat1 (N1 (29Schindler C. Fu X.-Y. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7836-7839Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar)), the carboxyl terminus of Stat1 (C1 (29Schindler C. Fu X.-Y. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C. Tempst P. Ihle J.N. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar)). N5 represents an IgG fraction prepared from crude serum (Pierce). Immunoblotted bands were detected by ECL as specified by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For sequential Western blots, filters were stripped in 2% SDS, 65 mm Tris (pH 6.7), and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol for 45 min at 50 °C. Cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 2% formaldehyde/PBS. After two additional PBS rinses, cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100 (in PBS; Sigma) for 2 min and then washed in 0.1% Tween 20 (in PBS; Sigma). Nonspecific protein adsorption was blocked by a 30-min incubation with 2% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Samples were incubated with primary antibody (C1; 1:200 in 2% bovine serum albumin/PBS) for 1 h (22 °C), washed, and then incubated with secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody, 1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 30 min. These samples were washed and examined at a magnification of ×400 under a Zeiss LSM410 laser scanning confocal microscope. 293 cells were selected to evaluate the function of mutant STATs because of their high transfection efficiency. However, as recent studies suggested that the amino-terminal domains of STATs may be required for a productive interaction with an appropriate receptor (30Li X. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we set out to design a generic receptor that would activate wild-type and amino-terminal chimeric STATs with equivalent efficiency. The extracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor was selected as the ligand-binding domain because only one type of receptor subunit is required for ligand binding and because of its limited pattern of tissue expression (e.g. not in 293 cells (21Ziegler S.P. Bird T.A. Morella K.K. Mosley B. Gearing D.P. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2384-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)). The endodomain included the minimal region of the IFN-α receptor α-chain (IFNAR1) implicated in JAK (i.e. Tyk2) binding/activation (20Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2082-2974Google Scholar, 31Colamonici O.R. Uyttendaele H. Domanski P. Yan H. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3518-3522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the 10-amino acid Stat1 recruitment/activation motif from the IFN-γ receptor α-chain (5Greenlund A.L. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). This chimeric receptor is referred to as G/aRα. To test the G/aRα receptor functionally, it was introduced into 293 cells by transient transfection and then stimulated with G-CSF. When the chimeric receptor was collected from transfected cells by virtue of its carboxyl-terminal Myc epitope tag (3Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), it was found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to ligand (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, activated Tyk2 co-immunoprecipitated with the receptor. Activation of Tyk2 was also evaluated directly. Consistent with previous studies (20Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2082-2974Google Scholar, 32Barbieri G.L. Velazquez L. Scrobogna M. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), a basal level of phosphorylated Tyk2 was observed in unstimulated cells, which then increased upon stimulation with G-CSF (Fig. 1 B). Stimulation of transfected cells with IFN-α, which activates the endogenous type I receptor, yielded a similar level of Tyk2 phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that the chimeric receptor and associated Tyk2 are activated in response to G-CSF in 293 cells. As anticipated, this receptor promotes the G-CSF-dependent activation of either endogenous or cotransfected Stat1 (see below). Experiments with control receptors demonstrated that the Stat1 recruitment tyrosine motif is required for STAT activation (data not shown). These results indicate that this chimeric receptor will be a valuable tool for the activation of transfected Stat1 chimeras. To test whether the conserved ∼100 amino acids at the amino terminus of STATs mediate a general or perhaps a more STAT-specific function(s), chimeric STAT molecules were prepared. To generate these chimeras, the amino terminus of Stat1 was carefully replaced by the homologous regions of Stat2 or Stat5 (Fig. 2 A). Amino acid 130 was selected for the site of fusion because it is poorly conserved and appears to form a random coil (6Chen X. Winkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 9Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.W. Science. 1998; 394: 145-151Google Scholar, 17Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L.

Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We predicted that if the function(s) encoded by this domain were conserved, then the chimeric molecules would behave similarly to wild-type Stat1. But, if they encoded STAT-specific functions, then these molecules should be functionally crippled. First, we determined whether these chimeric STATs were activated by the G/aRα receptor. Extracts were prepared from 293 cells cotransfected with both constructs, either before or after stimulation with G-CSF, and then evaluated by EMSA (Fig. 2 B). 293 cells transfected with G/aRα alone exhibited activation of endogenous Stat1α. The level of Stat1 DNA-binding activity increased when Stat1 was cotransfected. Surprisingly, cells cotransfected with the 2/1 or 5/1 chimeras (i.e. CH2/1 and CH5/1) demonstrated a more robust DNA-binding activity than wild-type Stat1 (either endogenous or recombinant). Moreover, the chimeric STATs exhibited a distinct mobility. Immunoblotting these extracts with a Stat1 carboxyl terminus-specific antibody (C1; an epitope that is present in each STAT construct) confirmed that each of these proteins was overexpressed to a similar level (Fig. 2 C). To further characterize these DNA-binding complexes, they were probed with antibodies directed either against the conserved Stat1 carboxyl terminus (C1) or their unique amino termini (N1 for Stat1, N2 for Stat2, and N5 for Stat5 (Fig. 2 D). Each of the chimeric complexes was recognized (i.e. supershifted or blocked) by C1. As anticipated, only the 5/1 chimera (CH5/1) was recognized by N5. Similarly, only the 2/1 chimera (CH2/1) interacted, albeit modestly, with N2. (N2 is a monoclonal antibody and not very effective at supershifting.) These studies demonstrate that chimeric STATs, activated through stimulation of a cotransfected receptor, each give rise to a novel DNA-binding complex. Moreover, although these STATs are all expressed at equivalent levels, the chimeric STATs give rise to more intense shift bands. The initial characterization of chimeric STAT DNA-binding activity was done 30 min after stimulation. To determine whether the observed differences in DNA-binding activity were dependent on the duration of stimulation, a kinetic study was undertaken. Transfected cells were stimulated with G-CSF for 5, 30, and 180 min. Consistent with published studies (33Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 34Shuai K. Schindler C. Prezioso V. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), wild-type Stat1 was maximally phosphorylated by 5 min. Densitometric evaluation indicated that there was a 2.5–3-fold loss of DNA-binding activity by 180 min (Fig. 3 A). Evaluation of the chimeric STATs revealed some notable differences. Early after stimulation, chimeric STATs were phosphorylated to similar level as Stat1. However, their level of phosphorylation continued to increase at 30 min and exhibited little decay at 180 min after stimulation. Analogous results were obtained when phosphorylation was evaluated by a less sensitive immunoblotting assay (Fig. 3 B). As anticipated, the immunoblotting assay found a decrease in the level of Stat1 phosphorylation after 180 min of stimulation. In contrast, the chimeric STATs remained heavily phosphorylated at this time point. However, this assay failed to demonstrate an increase in chimeric STAT phosphorylation at 180 min. Rather, there was a modest decrease. This suggests that changes other than those in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation (e.g. structural; see below) may contribute to the increase in DNA-binding activity. A faster migrating band (Fig. 3 B, left panel, labeled NS) represents a very low abundance, amino-terminally truncated isoform of Stat1 that can be detected only after substantial enrichment by immunoprecipitation from 293 cell extracts (data not shown). The filter was then reprobed with STAT-specific antibodies C1, N2, and N5 to demonstrate that the transfected STATs were immunoprecipitated to the same extent. These results demonstrate equivalent levels of phosphorylation at early times and suggest that wild-type and chimeric STATs are equipotent substrates for the JAK kinases. The relative increase in the amount of activated (i.e. phosphorylated) chimeric STAT is consistent with a process of accumulation (i.e. a defect in deactivation; see below). To determine whether the apparent defect in deactivation was due to either the presence of new amino-terminal sequences (i.e.Stat2 or Stat5) or the loss of Stat1 amino-terminal sequences, an amino-terminal Stat1 deletion mutant (i.e. ΔNStat1 (22Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J. Dighe A.S. Kaplan D.H. Riley J.K. Greenlund A.C. Campbell D. Carver-Moore K. DuBois R.N. Clark R. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 431-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar)) was examined. Evaluation of the kinetics of G-CSF-stimulated ΔNStat1 demonstrated a prolonged pattern of activation (i.e. DNA binding), analogous to what was observed for the chimeric STATs (Fig. 3 C). However, the level of ΔNStat1 activation was even higher and more rapid than observed for the chimeric STATs. Immunoblotting studies confirmed that ΔNStat1 was expressed at levels similar to wild-type and chimeric Stat1 (data not shown). These observations indicate that a loss of Stat1 amino-terminal sequences leads to an increase in the level of phosphorylation. The domain(s) encoded in the amino terminus of Stat2 or Stat5 do not compensate for this loss. Recent studies demonstrating that the duration of ligand-stimulated Stat1 DNA-binding activity is sensitive to kinase inhibitors indicated that prolonged DNA binding is dependent on continuous JAK activity (33Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Since chimeric STATs bind DNA long after JAK activity is likely to have decayed, their prolonged biological activity appears to be independent of kinase activity. To test this, the kinetics of wild-type and chimeric Stat1 DNA-binding activities were evaluated in the presence and absence of staurosporine, a JAK inhibitor (Fig. 4 A). Consistent with published studies, the DNA-binding activity of wild-type Stat1 was lost after 1 h of staurosporine treatment (Fig. 4 A, lane 5). In contrast, the DNA-binding activity of the chimeric STATs was only modestly affected by the addition of staurosporine (Fig. 4 A, lanes 10 and 15), indicating that only a fraction of the prolonged DNA-binding activity can be attributed to persistent kinase activity. Rather, these observations imply that an important cause for the increased amount of phosphorylated chimeric STATs is also due to a defect in deactivation. The preceding studies indicated that chimeric STATs accumulate in a phosphorylated form due to a defect in deactivation. However, they failed to provide any insight into whether this can be attributed to a structural change and/or a failure to localize to an appropriate compartment (e.g. where phosphatases may be active). Recently published studies suggested that a conserved amino-terminal STAT domain may promote interactions with a phosphatase (19Shuai K. Liao J. Song M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), but the crystal structure does not support this notion (18Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell J.E. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Moreover, a swap between two conserved domains would not be expected to affect a general function like the ability of STATs to interact with a phosphatase. Evaluation of the mobility of the chimeric STAT·DNA complexes indicated they differed from that of wild-type Stat1 (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). This suggested that the chimeras have undergone a structural change, at least when bound to DNA. Yet, most STAT functions were unaffected (e.g. the ability to productively interact with the receptor-kinase complex, to dimerize, or to bind DNA), indicating that the structural change was subtle. To crudely probe the structural properties of wild-type and chimeric Stat1, they were treated with three doses of a potent nonspecific phosphatase (Fig. 4 B). The DNA-binding activity of wild-type Stat1 was completely abrogated by 1 unit of phosphatase. In contrast, the 2/1 chimera had only a limited susceptibility to this phosphatase. A residual amount of DNA-binding activity was evident even after exposure to high doses of phosphatase. As anticipated, phosphatase activity was sensitive to sodium orthovanadate. Although these observations do not address the ability of chimeric STATs to potentially interact with native phosphatases, they do suggest that chimeric STATs exhibit a structural change that affects their ability to be nonspecifically dephosphorylated in vitro. Next, we examined the possibility that the accumulation of phosphorylated chimeric STATs might be secondary to failure to localize to an appropriate cellular compartment. Since previous studies had suggested that STATs may be dephosphorylated in the nucleus (35David M. Grimely P.M. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7515-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we considered a defect in nuclear translocation first. A sensitive immunofluorescence assay was selected to evaluate the ability of wild-type and chimeric STATs to translocate to the nucleus (10Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). In an effort to have the nuclear translocation of endogenous Stat1 (i.e. in nontransfe"

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Under most conditions, TFIIH is required for pol II transcription initiation. The need for TFIIH correlates with the well documented pol II requirement for the energetic β-γ phosphoanhydride bond of ATP (13Bunick D. Zandomeni R. Ackerman S. Weinmann R. Cell. 1982; 29: 877-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5321-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Negative supercoiling allows some promoters to initiate transcription without TFIIH in vitro (15Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and concurrently circumvents the energetic requirement for ATP (16Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Templates bearing heteroduplex start sites also eliminate the requirement both for TFIIH and for hydrolysis of the ATP β-γ phosphoanhydride bond (17Tantin D. Carey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17397-17400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Holstege F.C. Tantin D. Carey M. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), suggesting that during pol II initiation, TFIIH uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to promote local DNA unwinding at the transcription initiation site. This melted DNA intermediate is termed an “open complex.” An open complex is also formed during NER in a manner that is dependent on the TFIIH helicases and ATP (20Evans E. Fellows J. Coffer A. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 21Evans E. Moggs J.G. Hwang J.R. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6559-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The NER open complex appears to serve as an substrate for the site-specific endonucleases XPG and XPF. TFIIH is also implicated in post-initiation events, such as promoter escape and pol II elongation (22Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Recent studies have suggested that TFIIH exists in multiple forms (23Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.P.

In a transcriptionally active form, a set of common “core” subunits, consisting of XPB/ERCC3 (yeast SSL2), XPD/ERCC2 (RAD3), p62 (TFB1), p52 (TFB2), p44 (SSL1), and p34 (TFB4) (reviewed in Refs. 25Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholarand 26Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends. Biol. Sci. 1996; 249: 346-350Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar)), associate with a cyclin-Cdk complex that contains Cdk7/MO15 (yeast KIN28), cyclin H (CCL1), and MAT1 (TFB3). This kinase complex was previously equated with an activity, Cdk-activating kinase (known as CAK), that could phosphorylate and activate other Cdk molecules. Although evidence indicates that this complex may not be the physiologically relevant form of Cdk-activating kinase in yeast (27Cismowski M.J. Laff G.M. Solomon M.J. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the Cdk7 complex may nevertheless fulfill this role in metazoans (28Larochelle S. Pandur J. Fisher R.P. Salz H.K. Suter B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Another form of TFIIH is associated with other NER proteins and has been termed the “repairosome” (2Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1136-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).A number of human disorders stem from defects in TFIIH subunits. For example, mutations in several TFIIH subunits can lead to XP, a condition typified by extreme UV sensitivity, a high incidence of cancer, and defective NER. Specific mutations in the TFIIH subunits XPB and XPD, as well as the TFIIH-associated repair factor XPG, cause XP with manifestations of Cockayne's syndrome (CS), a complex disorder characterized by mental retardation, small stature, neurological defects, and UV sensitivity (reviewed in Lehman (31Lehmann A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 402-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). Cells taken from CS patients are sensitive to various DNA-damaging agents, such as UV radiation and the UV-mimetic agentN-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (32Schmickel R.D. Chu E.H.Y. Trosko J.E. Chang C.C. Pediatrics. 1977; 60: 135-139PubMed Google Scholar, 33van Oosterwijk M.F. Versteeg A. Filon R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4436-4444Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and they fail to recover the ability to synthesize RNA after exposure to UV (34Mayne L.V. Lehmann A.R. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1473-1478PubMed Google Scholar, 35van Hoffen A. Natarajan A.T. Mayne L.V. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. Venema J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5890-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). CS cells are also defective in TCR, as transcriptionally active genes do not repair transcriptionally active genes at higher rates than the surrounding DNA (35van Hoffen A. Natarajan A.T. Mayne L.V. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. Venema J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5890-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 36Venema J. Mullenders L.H. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A.

A. 1993; 90: 10499-10503Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the majority of CS patients do not harbor mutations in TFIIH subunits, but rather in two genes termedCSA and CSB/ERCC6 (38Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 39Henning K.A. Li L. Iyer N. McDaniel L.D. Reagan M.S. Legerski R. Schultz R.A. Stefanini M. Lehmann A.R. Mayne L.V. Friedberg E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 555-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Speculation has focused on CSA and CSB as eukaryotic transcription-repair coupling factors (1Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.-M. Vermeulen W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 25Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 40Friedberg E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 15-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In vitro evidence indicates that CSA and CSB interact with one another, that CSA interacts with the TFIIH p44 subunit (39Henning K.A. Li L. Iyer N. McDaniel L.D. Reagan M.S. Legerski R. Schultz R.A. Stefanini M. Lehmann A.R. Mayne L.V. Friedberg E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 555-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and that CSB interacts with the NER damage recognition factor XPA (41Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and the TFIIH-associated factor XPG (42Iyer N. Reagan M.S. Wu K.J. Canagarajah B. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2157-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).TFIIH is itself an important repair protein, as both the yeast and mammalian factors were shown to complement NER-defective cell extracts (11Drapkin R. Reardon J.T. Ansari A. Huang J.C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 43Wang Z. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The yeast TFIIH was shown to complement a rad3extract, whereas the isolated Rad3 protein could not (43Wang Z. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), indicating that Rad3 operated only in the context of the intact complex. These facts indicate that recruitment of TFIIH to sites of DNA damage may be an important step in the repair process. This supposition is substantiated by the finding that TFIIH can be recruited to DNA lesions by the XPA damage recognition protein in the absence of TFIIE, a factor that is important for recruiting TFIIH during formation of a transcription initiation complex (44Park C.-H. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4896-4902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 45Nocetani S. Coin F. Saijo M. Tanaka K. Egly J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22991-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although TFIIH plays a key role in NER, experiments suggest that TFIIH is lost from the pol II complex early in the transcription process and does not associate with the elongating polymerase (46Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). No evidence for re-recruitment of TFIIH to elongating pol II complexes has thus far been presented, and the potential for recruitment of TFIIH in TCR remains unexplored. More specifically, it is not known whether TFIIH recruitment in TCR follows a transcription-like pathway, in which TFIIE would play a role, a repair-like pathway, in which TFIIH is likely recruited by XPA, a combination of both pathways, or a mechanism in which TFIIH is recruited by other proteins.Previous work described an interaction between transcription complexes containing pol II, DNA, RNA, and the purified CSB/ERCC6 protein (47Tantin D. Kansal A. Carey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The complexes that interact with CSB were shown to be engaged in productive transcription. This interaction requires hydrolysis of the ATP β-γ phosphoanhydride bond. In this study, purified recombinant human CSB, an oligo(dC)-tailed template, immunopurified pol II, and partially purified TFIIH are used to explore the potential of the CSB protein to interact simultaneously with transcribing pol II molecules and with TFIIH. The results indicate that a pol II·CSB·DNA·RNA quaternary complex has the ability to recruit TFIIH or a related factor, providing a plausible mechanism for TCR in mammalian cells.DISCUSSIONAlthough pol II does not appear to directly interact with TFIIH in gel mobility-shift assays, the data support a model in which a molecular complex that contains the TFIIH subunits XPB/ERCC3 and p62 can interact with CSB, which can in turn interact with pol II in ternary complexes containing RNA (Figs. 2 and 3 A) and DNA (Fig. 3 B). This model is depicted in Fig. 4 (right). It provides a possible biochemical basis for the phenomenon of facilitated NER in active genes, including the fact that cells derived from patients with mutations in CSB and certain subunits of TFIIH have a defect in this pathway.CSA and CSB are implicated in the facilitated repair of active genes and linked to TFIIH both genetically and biochemically (reviewed in Friedberg (40Friedberg E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 15-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar)). Cells taken from Cockayne's syndrome patients are defective in TCR (35van Hoffen A. Natarajan A.T. Mayne L.V. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. Venema J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5890-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 36Venema J. Mullenders L.H. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A.

A. 1993; 90: 10499-10503Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the XPB and XPD subunits of TFIIH and the TFIIH-associated repair factor XPG can also lead to symptoms of CS, and CSA and CSB have been shown, respectively, to interact with TFIIH and XPG in vitro. A recent report found that a species of TFIIH containing XPB/ERCC3 could be recruited (either directly or indirectly) from a HeLa nuclear extract by a fragment of the CSB protein (41Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seemed reasonable that CSB could recognize DNA damage in active genes indirectly through pol II and recruit TFIIH or a TFIIH-like complex, facilitating DNA repair.The observation that CSA had no effect on its own, and was not absolutely required for the interactions described here may be explained by that fact that CSB, and not CSA, appears to contain important enzymatic activities (41Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 47Tantin D. Kansal A. Carey M. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18314-18317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the finding that WD repeat-containing proteins are frequently regulatory in nature (51Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). TCR of oxidative base damage is only partially defective in CSA mutant cells, but fully defective in CSB and XPG/CS cells (37Leadon S.A. Cooper P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10499-10503Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 52Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarckson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Two other possibilities are that the in vitro assay may be forced by the free addition of recombinant CSB, and the levels of protein foundin vivo may necessitate the presence of CSA, or that the immunopurified pol II or baculovirus-purified CSB may have partially co-purified with endogenous CSA or an insect homologue.The recruitment of TFIIH to stalled pol II complexes is reminiscent of TFIIH recruitment to transcription initiation complexes, and draws an interesting analogy with the pol II general transcription factor TFIIE (Fig. 4, left). CSB can interact with a stalled pol II elongation complex and recruit TFIIH. Similarly, TFIIE interacts with the pol II initiation complex and recruits TFIIH in reconstituted systems (53Flores O. Lu H. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2786-2793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TFIIE is also believed to modulate the enzymatic activities of TFIIH (8Lu H. Zawel L. Fisher L. Egly J.M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1992; 358: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 11Drapkin R. Reardon J.T. Ansari A. Huang J.C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 54Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and help stabilize an open DNA configuration (19Holstege F.C. Tantin D. Carey M. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether or not the analogy can be extended to these phenomena as well.Two studies have found that XPA, the main NER damage recognition protein, has an affinity for TFIIH and recruits it to the site of damaged DNA (44Park C.-H. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4896-4902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 45Nocetani S. Coin F. Saijo M. Tanaka K. Egly J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22991-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, center). XPC also associates with TFIIH and is required for NER (center). One possibility is that in TCR the repair mechanism operates in reverse, that is, first by recruitment of TFIIH to the lesion site indirectly through pol II and CSB. The TFIIH-XPA interaction may then bring XPA proximal to the lesion site and increase the likelihood of XPA damage recognition (Fig. 4, right). This idea is supported by the finding that CSB can also interact with XPA (41Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The subsequent NER mechanism would then follow exactly as normal. Interestingly, XPC is not required for TCR (55Venema J. van Hoffen A. Karcagi V. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). One intriguing possibility is that the CSB interaction surface on TFIIH is the same as or overlaps that for XPC, explaining the somewhat exclusive relationship between XPC and CSB.This facilitated repair system would not replace, but be superimposed upon the normal NER pathway in which XPA recognizes the DNA lesion directly, without a targeting mechanism. Recent results (56Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) indicate that a damaged region of DNA covered by pol II does not undergo reduced rates of repair, but rather is repaired normally. Thus a TFIIH recruitment mechanism would increase the baseline levels of repair that are already in place. In the above study, added purified CSA and CSB had no effect. 2D. Reinberg, personal communication. Perhaps a future system that includes the targeting step developed here may be applied toward recreating the entire coupling process with purified components, or toward the isolation of other components that are necessary for TCR. One advantage of this system is that only pol II need be added, so that the important roles of TFIIH can be addressed without a complicating requirement for transcription initiation.An interesting possibility is that the forms of TFIIH recruited during transcription initiation, NER, and TCR are different. In support of this idea, a highly purified and transcriptionally active 8-subunit TFIIH complex (kindly provided by J. and R. Conanway) cannot be recruited to the CSB-containing complex in labeled RNA-based gel mobility-shift assays. 3D. Tantin, unpublished observations.Although free of other general transcription factors, pol II, and XPG, the most purified TFIIH preparations used in these experiments may still contain auxiliary factors that aid in its recruitment. It should be noted that more highly purified preparations that have lost the XPA protein can also generate a supershift (data not shown).One or more factors not present in our assay system may also serve to further stabilize the aforementioned interactions or may act in later steps not modeled in our system, playing a key role in TCR in vivo. Candidate factors include TFIIE, TFIIF, XPG, and replication protein A. In addition the precise role of CSA remains to be deciphered. Furthermore, patients with manifestations of CS who do not fall into any “classic” complementation groups may harbor mutations in novel or unexpected genes encoding proteins that play an important role in this or related processes (57Itoh T. Ono T. Yamaizumi M. Mutat. Res. 1994; 314: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Finally, because of the complexity of the CS phenotype, including neurological disorders and developmental abnormalities, and the heterogeneity of reports in the literature, it is likely that the CS proteins play important roles other than as recruitment factors for TFIIH. In this respect, it is interesting to note that preferential repair of oxidative damage can also be defective in CS (52Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarckson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and that CSB interacts with the p53 protein in vitro (58Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Freidberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar).3 Recent data further indicate a potential role for the CSB protein in transcription elongation (59Balajee A.S. May A. Dianov G.L.

A. 1997; 94: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Thus, the CS proteins may also be involved in targeting other repair factors, such as those involved in base excision repair, to active genes (62Nouspikel T. Lalle P. Leadon S.A. Cooper P.K. Clarkson S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3116-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), in targeting p53 to respond to damage in active genes (63Yamaizumi M. Sugano T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2775-2784PubMed Google Scholar), and be involved in the transcription process directly.Recently, it has been reported that simultaneous incubation of transcription and DNA repair templates with yeast extracts leads to a partial loss of transcription efficiency. The effect is dependent upon the CSB protein, and can be reversed by the addition of yeast TFIIH (64You Z. Feaver W.J. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2668-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results are fully consistent with those reported here. TFIIH1 is a complex factor capable of multiple functions (for review, see Hoeijmakerset al. (1Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.-M. Vermeulen W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)). It contains approximately nine subunits, although considerable compositional variability has been reported (2Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z.

TFIIH contains multiple enzymatic activities, including two distinct DNA helicase activities encoded by the xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) B/excision repair cross-complementing (ERCC) 3 and XPD/ERCC2 subunits (6Schaeffer L.

Nature. 1992; 358: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In addition to XPD and XPB, several other TFIIH subunits are important NER factors (9Humbert S. van Vuuren H. Lutz Y.

The need for TFIIH correlates with the well documented pol II requirement for the energetic β-γ phosphoanhydride bond of ATP (13Bunick D. Zandomeni R. Ackerman S. Weinmann R.

Current models predict that the stator should be relatively rigid and engaged in contact with F1 at fixed points. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a series of deletion mutations in theuncF(b) gene to remove segments from the middle of the second stalk of the subunit. Mutants with deletions of 7 amino acids were essentially normal, and those with deletions of up to 11 amino acids retained considerable activity. Membranes prepared from these strains had readily detectable levels of F1-ATPase activity and proton pumping activity. Removal of 12 or more amino acids resulted in loss of oxidative phosphorylation. Levels of membrane-associated F1-ATPase dropped precipitously for the longer deletions, and immunoblot analysis indicated that reductions in activity correlated with reduced levels of b subunit in the membranes. Assuming the likely α-helical conformation for this area of the b subunit, the 11-amino acid deletion would result in shortening the subunit by approximately 16 Å. Since these deletions did not prevent the b subunit from participating in productive interactions with F1, we suggest that theb subunit is not a rigid rodlike structure, but has an inherent flexibility compatible with a dynamic role in coupling.

Luria broth supplemented with glucose isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside ampicillin chloramphenicol 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. The proton-translocating adenosine triphosphate (F1F0-ATP) synthases are responsible for the majority of ATP synthesis in most organisms (1Nakamoto R.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 791-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 3Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Enzymes of the F1F0-ATP synthase family are located in the mitochondria, chloroplast, and bacterial membranes. The energy of the electrochemical gradient across these membranes is used to drive ATP production. In the Escherichia coli enzyme, the F1 sector consists of five dissimilar subunits (α3, β3, γ, δ, ε) and houses the catalytic sites for ATP synthesis or ATP hydrolysis, and the F0 sector consists of three integral membrane subunits (a, b 2,c 9–12) and carries out proton conduction. Electron microscopy of E. coliF1F0-ATP synthase revealed that the F1 and F0 sectors are joined by two narrow stalks 40–45 Å in length (4Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Rotation of a central stalk complex comprising the γ and ε subunits, the “rotor,” is essential to the catalytic mechanism of F1F0-ATP synthase (5Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr K.

A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). A thinner peripheral second stalk consisting of the δ and twob subunits is thought to form the “stator,” which holds the catalytic complex stationary while the central stalk rotates. The stator concept was strongly supported by the observation that the δ subunit can be fixed to a specific α subunit without loss of activity (8Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal hydrophobic domain of the b subunit forms a single transmembrane-spanning domain while the bulk of the protein extends toward the F1 sector. More than a decade ago, proteolysis experiments showed that the cytoplasmic domain of theb subunit is required for binding F1 to F0 (9Hermolin J. Gallant J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

In the present study, a collection of deletion mutations in the bsubunit were constructed to investigate restrictions on subunit length. The deletions were positioned within the portion of the bsubunit thought to be the second stalk structure, or stator. In this study, retention of F1F0-ATP synthase activity in the deletion strains, rather than its loss, is the important parameter in testing the hypothesis. We demonstrate the bsubunit can tolerate deletions of up to 11 amino acids while still maintaining coupled enzymatic activity. This suggests that theb subunit is not necessarily a rigid rodlike structure. Molecular biology enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and New England Biolabs.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the DNA synthesis core facility of the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research. The bacterial strains and plasmids used to create the deletion or substitution mutations have been described previously (20Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All strains were grown in Luria broth supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glucose (LBG).1Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) (40 μg/ml), ampicillin (Ap) (100 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (Cm) (30 μg/ml) were added to media as appropriate. All cultures were incubated at 37 °C. Plasmids were purified with the Qiagen Mini-Prep and Maxi-Prep kits (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA). Double-stranded DNA sequence determinations were performed by automated sequencing in the core facility of the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research. Restriction endonuclease reactions, ligation reactions, and transformations were performed according to the recommendations of the suppliers (New England Biolabs and Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using the QIAquick kit (Qiagen Inc.). Plasmids pKAM14 (b) (22McCormick K.A. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24683-24691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or its derivative pTLC11 (b Arg-36→Ile) (20Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were used to construct the deletion mutations in the stalk region of the b subunit. pTLC11 (b Arg-36→Ile) has a restriction site (MunI) conveniently located for making the longer deletions. Many of the deletion plasmids were constructed by ligation of synthetic oligonucleotides into the MunI,PpuMI, PvuII, and XbaI sites in plasmids pKAM14 (b) and pTLC11 (b Arg-36→Ile) (Fig. 1). All synthetic oligonucleotides used in cloning with pTLC11 (b Arg-36→Ile) restoredb Arg-36 to the wild type codon. In addition, several plasmids were constructed without oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Plasmid pAUL5 (Δ11a) was generated by digestion of pKAM14 (b) with PpuMI and PvuII, treatment with DNA polymerase I, large (Klenow) fragment to fill the 5′ overhanging ends and blunt-end ligation. Plasmid pAUL11 (Δ18) was constructed by digestion of pKAM14 (b) with PpuMI and PvuII, treatment with mung bean nuclease and blunt-end ligation. Plasmid pAUL12 (b γ) was generated by replacing nucleotides 118–189 of the uncF(b) gene with nucleotides 676–747 of the uncH(γ) gene. Except for the deletions, the final products of all constructions were identical to the positive control plasmid pKAM14 (b) with theuncF(b) genes under control of the lac promoter. All deletion mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequence determination. Plasmids encoding deletion mutations and control plasmids pKAM14 (b) and pBR322, were transformed intoE. coli strain KM2 (Δb), which has been deleted for uncF(b) in the chromosome (28McCormick K.A. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7240-7248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strains were also transformed with plasmid pKAM16 (lacI q) (22McCormick K.A. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K.

Inverted membrane vesicles were prepared from cultures grown in 500 ml of LB (Ap, Cm) medium containing either no or 40 μm IPTG. Cells were harvested and washed in TM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmMgSO4, pH 7.5), and then suspended in TM buffer containing 10 μg/ml DNase I. Cells were disrupted using a French press at 14,000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells and debris were pelleted by two successive centrifugations (8000 × g, 10 min), and the membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation (150,000 × g, 1.5 h). Membranes were washed in TM buffer, and the final membrane pellet was resuspended in TM buffer and stored at 4 °C. Membrane vesicles stripped of F1 were prepared essentially as described previously (29Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32313-32317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry procedure (30Markwell M.A.K. Hass S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar). Membrane energization was detected by the fluorescence quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) (31Aris J.P. Klionsky D.J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11207-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis activity of membrane fractions was assayed by the acid molybdate method (32Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10043-10050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were assayed in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 9.1) for determinations of linearity with respect to both time and enzyme concentration. Proteins were loaded on a 15% Tris-glycine SDS Bio-Rad Ready Gel and transferred by electroblot onto nitrocellulose. Antibody incubation was performed essentially as described by Tamarappoo et al. (33Tamarappoo B.K. Handlogten M.E. Lane R.O. Serrano M.A. Dugan J. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2370-2374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a 1:25,000 dilution of b subunit-specific antibodies. Secondary antibody incubation was performed with horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:50,000 dilution), and antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence. Signals were visualized on Hyperfilm-HCl using a Kodak X-Omat, and strengths of signals were determined with a Kodak image digitizing system (DC120). In order to investigate restrictions on b subunit length, a collection of deletion mutations within the stalk region were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1). The deletion mutations were designed to model deletions of turns of an α-helix. For example, a deletion of two amino acids approximated a half-turn of an α-helix, while a deletion of seven amino acids approximated two turns of an α-helix. The effects of the deletion mutations were studied by complementation of strain KM2 (Δb) (28McCormick K.A. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7240-7248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous mutational analyzes of theb subunit found that the phenotypes could vary depending upon the level of expression resulting from induction of thelac promoter (22McCormick K.A. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24683-24691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general, induction can in some instances overcome the effects from assembly defects. Therefore, experiments were conducted under conditions of both high and low level expression of the uncF(b) gene. E. coli strains that are defective in ATP synthase cannot derive energy from nonfermentable carbon sources, so growth on succinate minimal medium was used as a qualitative measure of F1F0-ATP synthase activity in vivo. In both the presence and absence of IPTG, strain KM2/pAUL5 (Δ11a) had the largest deletion allowing detectable growth (Table I). No plasmid with a deletion of 12 codons or more was able to support growth even under high induction conditions. The position of the deletion affected the growth phenotypes. For example, KM2/pAUL3 (Δ7a) grew to a much higher yield than strain KM2/pAUL4 (Δ7b) in the absence of IPTG. Both deletions share loss of amino acids 54–56, so one may conclude that deletions of amino acids 50–53 (Δ7b) had a greater effect than loss of amino acids 57–60 (Δ7a). Similarly, the three different 11-amino acid deletion strains all grew under conditions of high induction, but the deletion of amino acids 54–64 (Δ11a) was less detrimental than the deletions extending in either direction.Table IAerobic growth properties of mutants expressing uncF(b) gene deletions and membrane-associated ATP hydrolysis activityStrains and b subunit deletionsAmino acids deletedGrowth1-aE. coli strains were grown aerobically on succinate minimal media with antibiotics.

Open table in a new tab An immunoblot analysis using an anti-b antibody was performed on membrane vesicles to detect production and incorporation of theb deletion subunits into the membrane (Fig. 2). Membranes derived from strain KM2/pAUL3 (Δ7a) approached normal levels, but all other deletion strains had reduced levels of b subunit present. In general, a marked decrease in steady-state levels of b subunit begins with the deletion of 11 amino acids and continues to decline with longer deletions in cells grown in the presence of IPTG. In uninduced cells, KM2/pAUL2 (Δ4) and KM2/pAUL8 (Δ12) yielded similarb subunit incorporation into the membranes, but displayed dramatically different growth phenotypes. Apparently, sufficient F1 bound to protect the Δ12 b subunit from digestion, but the association failed to constitute a functional F1F0-ATP synthase. Total membrane-associated F1-ATPase activity was used as a test of F1F0-ATP synthase complex assembly, since F1 has little affinity for the membrane in the absence of F0. F1-ATPase activity was determined under high pH conditions to remove the influence of F0 (34Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3292-3300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reductions in the levels of b subunit observed in the immunoblot studies were reflected in the amount of total F1-ATPase activity in the membrane (Table I). As expected, the membranes derived from deletion strain KM2/pAUL3 (Δ7a) had the highest level of F1-ATPase activity of the deletion strains, and KM2/pAUL5 (Δ11a) retained substantial amounts of enzyme. Levels of F1-ATPase activity fell precipitously with longer deletions. F1-protection of the recombinant b subunits was studied further in an in vitro trypsin digestion experiment. Immunoblot analyzes of the wild type KM200 (b) and deletion stain KM2/pAUL3 (Δ7a) membranes revealed no apparent digestion of theb subunits (Fig. 3). However, reduced levels of b subunit were observed over an extended incubation of membranes from deletion strains KM2/pAUL5 (Δ11a) and KM2/pAUL7 (Δ11c) with trypsin, suggesting a less stable association with F1. F1F0-ATP synthase-mediated ATP-driven proton pumping activity in membrane vesicles prepared from the deletion mutations was used as an indication of coupled activity. Acidification of inverted membrane vesicles was monitored by fluorescence of ACMA (Fig. 4). The level of NADH-driven fluorescence quenching was strong and comparable in all preparations tested, indicating that the membranes were intact closed vesicles (data not shown). Membranes derived from cells grown under conditions of high induction with deletions of seven or fewer amino acids had activities identical to that of wild type strain KM200 (b), suggesting that these small deletions did not alter the activity of an assembled F1F0-ATP synthase (Fig. 4 B). However, membranes from the same strains grown without IPTG had reduced proton pumping activity commensurate with the reduction in bsubunit assembled into the membranes (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, the amount of activity in membranes from induced cells carrying larger deletions correlated to the steady-state levels of b subunit in the membrane (Fig. 4 B). For instance, membranes from strain KM2/pAUL5 (Δ11a) had proton pumping activity (Fig. 4 B) comparable to the reduced levels of b subunit in the membrane (Fig. 2). The data included one oddity, in that membranes from strain KM2/pAUL8 (Δ12) had somewhat more activity than expected based upon the growth phenotype of this strain. With this one exception, the reductions in activity for the deletion strains reflected the reduced amounts of assembled F1F0-ATP synthase. Although the change in fluorescence in this assay is not strictly linear with respect to activity, it can be inferred that the intact F1F0-ATP synthase complexes containing theb subunits shortened by as many as 11 amino acids possessed coupled activity. The study was extended to investigate F0 function in membranes from deletion mutant strains. Passive proton permeability through F0 in membranes from the deletion mutation strains was studied by removal of F1 and following F0-mediated dissipation of an imposed proton gradient using ACMA fluorescence. Regardless of whether the cells were grown in the presence or absence of IPTG (Fig. 5), membranes prepared from strain KM2/pAUL3 (Δ7a) were virtually identical to the positive control membranes. All other deletion strain membranes had reduced rates of proton leakage. As expected, these data display a good correlation to the amount of F0 present in the membrane as judged from the amount of b subunit. It appeared that the deletions in the second stalk region of theb subunit did not directly affect F0-mediated proton conductance. Two observations led us to consider the possibility that any α-helical segment of an appropriate length would suffice for the second stalk region of theb subunit. First, b subunits with relatively large deletions participated in seemingly normal coupled activity in intact F1F0-ATP synthases, and second, the second stalk segment of the b subunit betweenb Arg-36 and b Ala-79 had only a low degree of primary sequence homology (20Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). If the amino acids in the stalk structure of the b subunit were only important to provide enough reach to position the portion of the subunit contacting F1, then replacement of the second stalk region of the b subunit with an α-helix with appropriate length might result in normal function. Therefore, plasmid pAUL12 (b γ) was constructed replacing amino acids 40–63 with amino acids 226–249 of the γ subunit. This segment of the γ subunit was known to form a long uninterrupted α-helix from x-ray crystallographic data (35Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar), and only a single amino acid,b Glu-49, was identical between the nativeb and the recombinant b γsubunits. In the presence of IPTG, strain KM2/pAUL12 (b γ) sustained growth on a minimal succinate plate. Membranes from these cells had approximately half of the normal levels of b subunit, F1-ATPase and proton pumping activity (Figs. 2 and 4, Table I). F1F0-ATP synthase was not detectable without induction. Like the deletions, the substitution of the segment resulted in decreased levels of F1F0-ATP synthase, but enzyme that assembled with the recombinant b subunit was functional. The evidence indicated that amino acids 40–63 of theb subunit could be replaced with an unrelated α-helical segment. The present work describes the effects of deletion mutations positioned in the area of the second stalk of the b subunit spanning the distance between the F1 and F0sectors. The major effects of all of the deletion mutations were altered assembly and stability of the F1F0-ATP synthase complex. However, removal of as many as 7 amino acids resulted in a virtually normal phenotype, and substantial F1F0-ATP synthase activity was retained with deletion of up to 11 amino acids. Assuming the probable secondary structure of this segment of the b subunit, three full turns of the α-helix amounting to approximately 16 Å of length were eliminated without producing catastrophic effects on the enzyme. We have not rigorously excluded stretching the second stalk region by distortion of the α-helix or conversion to some other extended secondary structure, but it is probable that the deletions result in removal of material which provide flexibility to the second stalk. If the second stalk were rigid and establishing fixed points of interaction with the F1, then reducing the reach of theb subunit by one-third of the length required to span the distance between F1 and F0 would have been expected to result in failure of the stator and loss of F1F0-ATP synthase function. Recent electron microscopy studies by Wilkens and Capaldi (4Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) revealed that the second stalk has a distinctive bend, suggesting that shortening theb subunit might be accomplished with minimal loss of F1F0-ATP synthase function by straightening the second stalk. Of course larger deletions result in defects that cannot be overcome even by overproduction of the recombinant b subunit. Deletion of the fourth turn of the α-helix in strain KM2/pAUL10 (Δ14) prevented assembly of the F1F0-ATP synthase complex. The Δ14 b subunit apparently falls short of the minimum length required for interactions with the δ subunit. The Δ12 and Δ13 b subunit deletions provided some evidence of interaction with F1, but this was not productive for ATP synthesis. Perhaps the loss of function in the apparently assembled F1F0-ATP synthase complexes is related to the orientation of the helices from the twob subunits. A much stronger case for the importance of orientation can be made from the shorter deletions studied under conditions of low expression. The relative efficiency of assembly for three similarly positioned b subunit deletions is Δ7a > Δ4 > Δ2. Reorienting the b subunit hydrophilic domain one-half turn of an α-helix is apparently more detrimental than removing full turns. It should be noted that cysteine replacement and disulfide cross-linking experiments indicate that one area of interaction between the two subunits is atb Ala-59 and b Ser-60 (18McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These amino acids were retained in the Δ4 b subunit but deleted from the Δ7a b subunit. Apparently, other intersubunit interactions important for dimerization are more easily accommodated by elimination of a segment 20° degrees short of two complete turns as opposed to a deletion 40°beyond one full turn. Moving the position of the deletions vertically along the second stalk also affects the phenotype. Although all three 11-amino acid deletions produced functional F1F0-ATP synthases, differences in levels of assembled enzyme were readily apparent. The Δ11c b subunit lacks a segment thought to contribute to dimerization of theb subunits based upon truncation studies using theb sol model system (18McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Δ11b bsubunit deletion is proximal to F0 and may affect the interactions with the a subunit. The evidence presented in these relatively simple experiments seems incompatible with models implying a rigid structure for the stator of F1F0-ATP synthase. This interpretation lends support for the idea that the b subunit interacts with the δ subunit to form a dynamic stator. Junge et al. (36Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) suggested that the role of the b subunit in the catalytic mechanism might be as an elastic element, which could store free energy gained from the translocation of protons. One prediction of this hypothesis is that shortening the b subunit would alter this elasticity, and this has not yet been tested. Flexibility of the b subunit may have importance in establishing the intersubunit interactions involved in the initial assembly of the enzyme complex. However, three observations have led us to propose a different model for the role of the second stalk in F1F0-ATP synthase. First, theb 2δ interaction appears to be remarkably weak for a static structural feature holding the α3β3 hexamer against the rotation of the central stalk subunits (14Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31058-31064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Sawada K. Kuroda N. Watanabe H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Second, theb Arg-36→Glu substitution near the base of the stalk uncouples F1 catalytic activity from F0proton translocation (20Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This phenotype has been associated with thec subunit cytoplasmic loop implicated in the dynamic interactions between F0 and the rotor (37Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the length of the b subunit in the area of the second stalk between amino acids b Arg-36 and b Ala-79 appears to be conserved in all bacterial F1F0-ATP synthases (20Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22McCormick K.A. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24683-24691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the specific length of the second stalk confers a selective advantage even though the shorter b subunit deletions are not growth-limiting. The essential feature of our hypothesis is that the weak interaction between the b 2 dimer and the δ subunit is designed to be broken. As the central stalk rotates relative to the α3β3 hexamer, frictional stress builds to a point in which a release of this stress is necessary for continued rotation and ATP production. Transient dissolution of the second stalk would dissipate this stress. The second stalk is reconstituted by establishing a new interaction betweenb 2 and δ subunits. It is in reforming the second stalk where inherent flexibility of the b subunit would be of importance. Flexibility in the second stalk region of theb subunit could provide freedom of motion favorable for recapturing F1. The ultimate test of the model must involve a direct demonstration of the dissociation of the second stalk with catalytic turnover. It further predicts that a covalent linkage between the b subunit and any F1 subunit will inhibit F1F0-ATP synthase."

Respiratory competence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled by upward of several hundred nuclear genes referred to asPET genes (1Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in PET genes are generally recessive and are recognized by an inability of the mutant to utilize nonfermentable carbon sources. In some instances, loss of mitochondrial functions depends on the genotype of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). For example, lesions in gene products that promote splicing of specific mitochondrial introns elicit a respiratory defect only in strains whose mitochondrial genome contains the cognate intron (2Seraphin B. Boulet A. Simon M. Faye G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6810-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 3Hill J. McGraw P. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3235-3238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another interesting situation has been reported in mss1mutants which become respiratory-deficient only when their mtDNA has a point mutation in the 15 S rRNA conferring resistance to paromomycin (4Decoster E. Vassal A. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the paromomycin-resistant background, mss1 mutants fail to splice the COX1 pre-mRNA for subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase (4Decoster E. Vassal A. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mutant phenotype was interpreted to indicate that Mss1p normally interacts with the 15 S rRNA. This interaction was proposed to be weakened or to not occur in the presence of the paromomycin-resistance allele, resulting in suppression of translation of the intron encoded maturases of the COX1 gene (4Decoster E. Vassal A. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). According to this interpretation, the processing block is secondary to a translational defect. The absence in mss1mutants of an obvious phenotype in the context of a wild type 15 S rRNA gene further suggests that Mss1p may be necessary for optimization of mitochondrial translation but is not essential for this activity (4Decoster E. Vassal A. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The pet phenotype expressed in the presence of the paromomycin-resistance allele is not unique to mss1 mutants. In the present communication, we show that mutations in another gene, here designated as MTO1 (mitochondrial translation optimization), result in properties similar to those described formss1 mutants. Evidence is also presented that Mto1p and Mss1p are complexed to one another and therefore are likely to carry out a common function.

Open table in a new tab MTO1 was cloned by transformation of E39/U1 (α ura3–1 mts1–1) with a yeast genomic plasmid library by the method of Schiestl and Gietz (8Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). The library used for the transformation was made from partialSau3A fragments of nuclear DNA (averaging 7–15 kb)1 cloned into theBamHI site of the shuttle vector YEp24 (9Botstein D. Davis R.W. Srathern J.N Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 607-636Google Scholar). This library was kindly provided by Dr. Marian Carlson, Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University. Approximately 1 × 109 cells were transformed with 50 μg of plasmid DNA. The transformation mixtures were plated on minimal glucose medium to select Ura+ clones. After 3 days, the transformation plates containing 104 colonies were replicated to YEPG medium to identify respiratory-competent transformants. MSS1 was cloned by transformation of E221/L1 (αleu2–3,112 mss1) with a library similar to that described above except that the shuttle vector was YEp13 (10Broach J.R. Strathern J.N. Hicks J.B. Gene. 1979; 8: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Following transformation of the mutant by the method of Beggs (11Beggs J.D. Nature. 1978; 275: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), respiratory-competent clones were selected on minimal glucose. Approximately 5000 Leu+ clones were obtained from the transformation of 108 cells. Of these, one clone was ascertained to be respiratory-competent. This transformant E221/L1/T1 contained plasmid pG121/T1. Wild type and mutant yeast were grown to stationary phase in YPGal (2% galactose, 1% yeast extract, and 2% peptone), and mitochondria were prepared by the procedure of Faye et al. (12Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), except that Glusulase was replaced by Zymolyase 20,000 (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). Mitochondria were assayed for NADH-cytochrome c reductase, succinate-cytochrome-c reductase, and cytochrome oxidase as described previously (13Mashkevich G. Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14356-14364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) A null allele of MTO1 was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 5′ and 3′ sequences adjacent to the gene using the divergent primers 5′-gccgggtaccgtatgtaaccatcaaattcg and 5′-cgccggtaccgttctttggggcgtttagc. The template for the amplification consisted of the 3.5-kb BamHI-SacI fragment cloned in pUC18. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with KpnI and ligated to a 1.1-kb KpnI fragment containing the yeast URA3 gene. The null allele, recovered as a linear BamHI-SacI fragment, was introduced into the diploid strain W303 by the one-step gene replacement procedure (14Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 201-211Google Scholar). Ura+ transformants were sporulated and subjected to tetrad dissections. Four independent Ura+ spores were verified by Southern analysis of their genomic DNA to harbor the null allele. The disrupted allele of MSS1 was obtained by insertion of a 1.8-kb BamHI fragment with HIS3 at the BglII site inside the gene. The linear KpnI-EcoRI fragment containing the disrupted allele was substituted for the wild type gene in the respiratory-competent haploid strain W303–1A. Transformation with the linear fragment yielded seven His+ transformants of which one (aW303ΔMSS1) was respiratory-deficient and was not complemented by a ρo tester, indicating that it lacked or had a deletion in mitochondrial DNA. Antibodies against Mto1p were obtained by immunizing rabbits with a fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene for the fusion protein was made by ligating the 900-base pairPstI-EcoRI fragment coding for residues 154–474 to the amino-terminal half of the E. coli trpE gene in the pATH23 (15Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid expressed a 68-kDa protein consisting of the amino-terminal half of anthranylate synthetase component I fused in-frame to the Mto1p sequence. This protein was recovered in the insoluble fraction of E. coli cells harboring the pATH23 construct. The insoluble protein fraction was dissolved in a 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, buffer containing 2% SDS, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and was further purified on a Bio-Gel A-0.5 column developed with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Fractions enriched for the fusion protein were pooled, concentrated by acetone precipitation, and used to raise antibodies in rabbits. The above method was also used to obtain an antibody against an Mss1p fusion protein. The gene was made by ligating the 1.1-kbBglII-EcoRI fragment containing theMSS1 sequence starting from codon 195 to pATH23 (15Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) linearized with BamHI and EcoRI. The 70-kDa fusion protein expressed in E. coli transformants was partially purified as above and used to immunize rabbits. Standard procedures were used for the preparation and ligation of DNA fragments and for transformation and recovery of plasmid DNA from E. coli (16Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The preparation of yeast nuclear DNA and the conditions for the Southern hybridizations, were as described by Myers et al. (7Myers A.M. Pape K.L. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). DNA probes were labeled by random priming (17Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced either by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (18Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5478) Google Scholar) or Sanger et al. (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) with T7 sequencing kit (United States Biochemical). Proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the buffer system of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and Western blots were treated with antibodies against the fusion proteins followed by a second reaction with125I-protein A (21Schmidt R.J. Myers A.M. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1984; 1: 317-334PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E39 is one of two independent isolates assigned to complementation group G158 of a pet mutant collection (1Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both mutants were derived from the respiratory-competent haploid strain D273–10B/A21 (6Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Foury F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 65: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This strain has a mitochondrial genome with the three drug-resistant markersoli1 R , ery R ,and par R. The respiratory defect of both G158 mutants is complemented by ρo testers, indicating that they have recessive mutations in a nuclear gene. The mutants are genetically unstable and convert readily to ρ− and ρo derivatives. The absorption spectrum of an extract of E39 mitochondria indicates the absence of cytochrome b and cytochromes a, a 3 (Fig. 1). This pleiotropic phenotype is usually found in mutants defective in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Pulse labeling of whole cells with [35S]methionine in the presence of cycloheximide, however, indicated that the mutant is able to synthesize most of the mitochondrial gene products (Fig. 2 A). The exception is subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase that is not detected among the labeled proteins. It is interesting that incorporation of [35S]methionine is more efficient in the mutant than in wild type yeast. The exact increase is difficult to quantitate but must be more than indicated by the autoradiogram in view of the fact that the mutant culture used in the experiment consisted of 50% ρ− and ρo cells which do not contribute to the activity.Figure 2Mitochondrial translation products and transcripts in wild type and a mto1 mutant. A, the wild type parental strain D273–10B/A21 and themto1 mutant E39 were grown in 10 ml of YPD (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose) overnight. The cells were harvested, washed with sterile water, transferred to 25 ml of minimal 0.8% glucose medium (Difco, nitrogen base without amino acids), and incubated with shaking for 1 h. Cycloheximide was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 10 min, 1 mCi of [35S]methionine was added and incorporation allowed to proceed for 1.5 h. Protein synthesis was quenched by addition of 1.2 m sorbitol containing 2 mg/ml chloramphenicol and 1 mm cycloheximide. The cells were collected, washed several times in the same buffer, and digested with Zymolase for 5 min in 2 ml of 1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 140 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mg/ml Zymolyase. The spheroplasts were lysed in 0.5 msorbitol and 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation of the lysate. Total mitochondrial proteins (90 μg) were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The migration of size standards is indicated in theright-hand margin. The known mitochondrial translation products Var1, subunit 1 (Cox1), 2 (Cox2), and 3 (Cox3) of cytchrome oxidase, cytochrome b (Cob), subunits 6 (Atp6), and 9 (Atp9) of ATPase are identified in the left-hand margin.B, total mitochondrial RNA (2 μg) of the parental strain D273–10B/A21 and of the mto1 mutant E39 was separated on a 1% nondenaturing gel and transferred to DBM (diazobenzyloxymethyl) paper. The blot was hybridized to a COB probe consisting of 104 nucleotides of 5′ untranslated and 67 nucleotides from the first exon of the gene. A comparable blot was hybridized to a 350-base pairHinfI fragment from the fourth exon of the COX1gene. The bands corresponding to the precursors and the fully spliced mRNAs are identified in the legend.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The deficit in the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 was consistent with the results of Northern blot analysis of the mitochondrial COX1transcripts for cytochrome oxidase subunit 1. Probes specific for exon regions of these RNAs indicated lower concentrations of the mature mRNAs and accumulation of partially processed precursors (Fig. 2 B). Processing of cytochrome b is also retarded in the mutant. It is not clear from the gel of the radioactively labeled proteins whether synthesis of this protein is affected in the mutant because of its comigration with subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase (Fig. 1 A). A gene capable of complementing the respiratory defect of E39/U1 was cloned by transformation of the mutant with a yeast genomic library based in the episomal plasmid YEp24 (9Botstein D. Davis R.W. Srathern J.N Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 607-636Google Scholar). The transformation yielded five respiratory-competent and uracil-independent clones. The plasmids were isolated from the transformants and amplified in E. coli, and their nuclear DNA inserts were characterized. Restriction mapping indicated that the nuclear DNA inserts of the different plasmids were related. The end points of one of the plasmids (pG158/T1) were sequenced and located in the genomic sequence of chromosome VII. This plasmid was also used to subclone the complementing gene by transferring different regions of the insert to the yeast/E. coli shuttle vector YEp352 (24Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) and testing the ability of the new constructs to confer respiration in E39/U1 (Fig. 3). The results of these transformations indicated that the gene is located between the uniqueBamHI and SacI sites of the pG158/T1 insert. This region encompasses HAP2 (25Pinkham J.L. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3410-3416Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and reading frame YGL236C coding for a 74-kDa protein of unknown function. Neither pG158/ST3 or pG158/ST2 containing the entire HAP2 gene restored respiration, indicating that the complementing gene is YGL23C. We propose MTO1 (mitochondrial translation optimization) as a name for this gene for reasons discussed later in this paper. The sequence of Mto1p is homologous to the gdiA proteins encoded in the genomes of various bacteria (26Messer W. Hartman-Kuehlein H. Langer U. Mahlow E. Roth A. Schaper S. Urmoneit B. Woelker B.

The sequence similarity extends from approximately residue 40 to the very carboxyl terminus of the protein (Fig. 4). The function of this highly conserved protein is not known.Figure 4Dot matrices of Mto1p and a bacterial and eucaryotic homolog. The Compare algorithm of the GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package (University of Wisconsin) was used with a window of 15 residues and a stringency of 9 to obtain the two dot matrices.

This mutant is phenotypically similar to E39/U1. A single respiratory-competent clone was obtained in the transformation. Respiration of the transformant was found to be dependent on a segregating plasmid (pG122/T1) whose nuclear DNA insert was determined to span the region of chromosome XIII from nucleotides 314,900 to 321,400. The smallest subclone (pG122/ST4) capable of complementing E221/L1 contained MSS1 (Fig. 5). To determine whether E39/U1 has a mutation in MTO1, a null mutation (Δmto1::URA3) was introduced in the respiratory-competent diploid strain W303. The construction of the null allele is described under “Materials and Methods” and depicted in Fig. 6. Uracil-independent clones obtained from a transformation of the diploid strain W303 with the null allele on a linear fragment of DNA were subjected to tetrad dissections. The auxotrophic requirement of the meiotic spore progeny indicated a 2:2 segregation of the URA3 disrupter. The Ura+ haploid strains were confirmed by Southern analysis of their genomic DNA to harbor the Δmto1::URA3 null mutation in their chromosomal DNA (Fig. 6). Unlike the original mutant, however, the Ura+ clones (W303ΔMTO1(PS)) were respiratory-competent as judged by growth on glycerol (Fig. 7). The presence of a functional respiratory chain in the null mutant was also evident from the visible absorption spectrum of mitochondria, which indicated the presence of cytochromes b and cytochrome oxidase (Fig. 8). The transformants, however, have a higher concentration of cytochrome b relative to cytochromea. The aberrant ratio of the two cytochromes is also reflected in the increased NADH-cytochrome c reductase and reduced cytochrome oxidase activity of mitochondria from the transformant (Fig. 9). The increased ratio of cytochromes b/a is also seen in anmto1/msss1 double mutant (W303ΔMTO1/MSS1(PS)) (Fig. 7).Figure 7Effect of the paromomycin-resistance marker on growth of mto1 mutants. A respiratory-competent strain (W303–1A), the null mutant in a paromomycin-resistant (aW303ΔMTO1(PR)) and paromomycin-sensitive background (aW303ΔMTO1(PS)), and the point mutant E39/U1 were grown on rich glucose medium and replicated on rich glycerol medium (YEPG).

Mitochondria were prepared from the parental wild type strain W303–1A and W303ΔMTO1(PS) and assayed for NADH-cytochrome c reductase, succinate-cytochromec reductase, and cytochrome oxidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of the mto1 null mutant, W303ΔMTO1(PS), to respire could indicate either thatMTO1 is a suppressor of E39 or that the respiratory defect of mto1 mutants is affected by the mitochondrial genetic background. The mitochondrial genomes of W303 and D279–10B/A21 used to obtain E39 differ in their intron composition and in the presence in the latter of mutations in the OLI1, ERY, and PARloci conferring resistance to these antibiotics (6Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Foury F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 65: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To test the possible influence of mitochondrial genetic background on the phenotype of mto1 mutants, W303ΔMTO1(PS) was cured of mtDNA by treatment with ethidium bromide. The ρoderivative was crossed to D273–10B/A21, whose mtDNA carries the drug-resistance mutations oli1 R,ery R, and par R, and to D273–10B/A1, which has an identical genome except for the absence of the drug-resistant mutations. Diploid cells were sporulated for tetrad analysis. Meiotic progeny issued from the cross to D273–10B/A21 showed a 2:2 segregation of the respiratory-competent phenotype. In all cases, the respiratory-defective phenotype coincided with the uracil-independence. In contrast, all four meiotic progeny from the cross to the drug-sensitive strain D273–10B/A1 were respiratory-competent even though the Ura+ phenotype showed the expected 2:2 segregation patterns. These results excluded an effect of intron composition difference on the phenotype but rather suggested that expression of respiratory deficiency in the mto1 mutant was dependent on one of the drug-resistance mutations (Fig. 5). In a previous study mutations in MSS1 were shown to elicit respiratory deficiency only in strains carrying the paromomycin-resistance allele in mitochondrial DNA (4Decoster E. Vassal A. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To determine whether this was also true of the mto1 mutant, meiotic progeny were analyzed from a cross of the ρo derivative of W303ΔMTO1(PS) to a strain containing only the paromomycin-resistance marker. Tetrad analysis of meiotic products of this cross confirmed that the presence of mtDNA with the paromomycin-resistance allele was sufficient for the expression of respiratory deficiency in the mto1 mutant. In addition to its respiratory deficiency, W303ΔMTO1(PR) containing the paromomycin-resistance marker displayed the same pleiotropic absence of cytochromes b, a, and a 3 as E39 (Fig. 1). The similar phenotypes of W303ΔMTO1(PR) and E39 suggested linkage of the two mutations. This was confirmed genetically. For these allelism tests,MTO1 was transferred to the integrative vector YIp352 (24Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) yielding pG158/ST5. This plasmid was linearized at the uniqueSmaI site of MTO1. The linear plasmid was used to transform E39/U1. Ura+ clones obtained from the transformation of the mutants were respiratory-competent, suggesting that the integration had occurred at the locus of the mutation. This was verified by crosses of a respiratory-competent clone to the wild type haploid strain W303–1B and to W303ΔMTO1(PR) containing the Δmto1::URA3 allele. Diploid cells issued from each cross were sporulated for tetrad analysis. The four meiotic products from the back-cross to the wild type W303 strain were respiratory-competent (nine complete tetrads). Analysis of the tetrads obtained from the cross to the mto1 null mutant showed a 2:2 segregation of the respiratory-competent phenotype (nine complete tetrads). In all cases, respiratory competence cosegregated with uracil independence. These results provide direct evidence of genetic linkage of the E39 and mto1 null allele. To facilitate the localization of Mto1p, part of the gene was fused in-frame to a segment of trpE coding for the amino-terminal half of anthranylate synthase component I. Antibodies raised against the fusion protein were used to test for the presence of Mto1p in the mitochondrial and postmitochondrial supernatant fractions of wild type yeast, a mutant transformant with the gene on a high copy plasmid, and themto1 null mutant. The antibody detected a protein of the expected size (approximately 70 kDa) in mitochondria of wild type and of the transformant but not in mitochondria from the null mutant. The signal was weak in wild type mitochondria and was greatly enhanced in the transformant (Fig. 10). Antibodies were also raised against an Mss1p fusion protein. This antibody was used to probe for Mss1p in the mitochondria and postmitochondrial supernatant fractions from wild type and mutant yeast strains. The results of the Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of a protein of approximately 55 kDa in the mitochondrial but not in the soluble fraction of wild type and the transformant (E221/L1/ST1). The stronger signal seen in the transformant and its absence in the mutant confirmed that this band corresponds to Mss1p (Fig. 10). The similarity in the phenotypes of mto1 and mss1 mutants raised the possibility that the two proteins are functionally related and therefore may exist in a physical complex. This was tested by sedimentation analysis of a yeast transformed with a multicopy plasmid (pG158/ST12) containing a copy of MTO1 and MSS1in a tandem orientation. An extract obtained by sonic disruption of mitochondria was applied to a 5–20% sucrose gradient. Hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase were added to the extract as molecular weight standards. The gradient was analyzed for the distribution of Mto1p, Mss1p, and for the two molecular weight standards, hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase. The sedimentation properties of Mto1p and Mss1p are consistent with their existence in a complex. Mto1p and Mss1p cosediment and peak in a region of the gradient closer to lactate dehydrogenase than to hemoglobin (Fig. 11). Based on its position relative to the two marker proteins, the average molecular weight of the complex was estimated as 124,000. This would suggest a heterodimer consisting of a single copy of each protein. The respiratory deficiency of mto1 mutants is contingent on the presence in mitochondrial DNA of a single base change at nucleotide 1477 of the 15 S ribosomal RNA gene (28Li M. Tzagoloff A. Underbrink-Lyon K. Martin N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5921-5928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sor F. Fukuhara H. Slonimski P. Borst P. Attardi G. Mitochondrial Genes. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 255-262Google Scholar). The mutation, a C → G transposition, confers resistance to paromomycin, an inhibitor of procaryotic protein synthesis. This unusual phenotype has also been reported for mss1 mutants (4Decoster E. Vassal A. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These and other properties shared by mto1 and mss1 mutants prompted us to examine if the products of the two genes might be subunits of a single complex. As expected, immunochemical studies confirmed Mto1p and Mss1p to be constituents of mitochondria. When a mitochondrial extract obtained from a yeast transformant overexpressing Mto1p and Mss1p was centrifuged through a sucrose gradient the two proteins displayed identical sedimentation properties indicative of their presence in a complex. The molecular weight of the complex was estimated to be 121,000 based on its sedimentation relative to the dehydrogenase and 128,000 relative to hemoglobin. These values are 4–11 kDa lower than the 132 kDa expected for a complex consisting of one copy of each subunit. The calculated molecular weight of the heterodimer, however, does not take into account the loss of amino-terminal signal sequences that are likely to be present in both proteins. The phenotype of mss1 and mto1 mutants suggests that the C at nucleotide 1477 is necessary for interaction of the Mto1p·Mss1p complex with the 15 S rRNA. This explanation would require that the interaction is weakened or prevented by the mutation conferring paromomycin resistance. Western blot analysis of wild type mitochondrial ribosomes and of the subunits fractionated on sucrose gradients, however, failed to reveal any association of either protein with the large or small subunit of the ribosomes. Even though this constitutes strong evidence that neither protein is a subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes, it does not exclude a transient interaction of the Mto1p·Mss1p complex with ribosomes during translation. The properties of the mutants are indicative of a role of Mss1p and Mto1p in some aspect of mitochondrial translation. In a paromomycin-resistant background, mutations in MSS1 result in an increase of the steady-state concentration of partially splicedCOX1 transcripts (4Decoster E. Vassal A. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Decoster et al. (4Decoster E. Vassal A. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) concluded that the processing block was a consequence of the failure of the mutant to translate the maturases encoded in some of the intronic regions of the COX1 pre-mRNA, thereby causing accumulation of incompletely spliced transcripts. Another hallmark of mss1 mutants is the complete absence of subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase, the product of COX1. Both of the above properties are also true of mto1 mutants. The results of in vivo labeling of mitochondrial translation products indicate that other translation products including subunits 2, ATP6, and subunit 9 (the status of cytochrome b is difficult to ascertain from the radioautogram because of its comigration with subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase) are more efficiently translated in themto1 mutant. A possible explanation for this observation is that the translation rate in the mutant is less regulated. Although we have not examined mitochondrial translation in mto1 mutants with a paromomycin-sensitive genome, their spectra are also indicative of an unbalanced production of the respiratory chain components. The mutants have more cytochrome b relative to cytochromesa and a 3 and higher NADH- and succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity. The latter is probably a consequence of an increase in coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase, which contains cytochrome b as one of its electron carriers. The absence of subunit 1 in mto1 and mss1mutants, despite 30–50% of mature COX1 mRNA, could be because of a defect in initiation of translation. Although the involvement of the Mto1p·Mss1p complex in translational initiation cannot be excluded, it seems unlikely for the following reasons. With the exception of the COX1, the mutants are able to translate most other mRNAs even more efficiently than the wild type strain. The argument would therefore need to be made that only translational initiation of selected transcripts such COX1 depend on Mto1p·Mss1p. This is difficult to reconcile with the widespread occurrence of homologous proteins in bacteria, which implies general rather than a specialized function of the proteins. A requirement in initiation of translation also fails to explain the almost 2-fold increase in the coenzyme QH2-cytochrome creductase relative to wild type in the context of the paromomycin-sensitive allele. An alternative explanation is that the Mto1p·Mss1p complex has a proofreading function in mitochondrial and perhaps more generally in eucaryotic protein synthesis. According to this interpretation, Mto1p·Mss1p interact with the small ribosomal subunit probably at a site in the 15 S rRNA close to or inclusive of the paromomycin locus. In the presence of the paromomycin-resistance mutation, this interaction is preempted, resulting in a high rate of mutations in mitochondrially translated proteins. As a result, a large percentage of the proteins are no longer functional. The accumulation of partially spliced COX1 and COB intermediates in the mutant according to this interpretation is a consequence not of a defect in translation of the intron-encoded maturases but rather of mutations in proteins of this class that impair their functions. The complete absence of the subunit 1 despite the presence of some COX1mRNA protein may be explained by a more rapid turnover of mutant copies of subunit 1. Although the other proteins are present in higher than normal concentrations, the steady-state levels may give a false impression of the actual amounts synthesized. Thus, depending on their intrinsic stability there may be differences in the rates of degradation. It is interesting to note that there appears to be an inverse relationship between the size of the protein and the apparent increase in its concentration in the mutant. For example, Atp9, the smallest product of mitochondrial protein synthesis shows the largest increase in the mutant. The ability of mto1 and mss1 mutants to respire in paromomycin-sensitive strains, according to this model, implies that translation is more accurate under these circumstances. The fewer mutations in this background may be tolerated in the mutants without grossly affecting respiration. The increase of cytochrome creductase (cytochrome b) relative to cytochrome oxidase (cytochromes a, a 3) may be indicative of some loss of subunit 1 even in the paromomycin-sensitive background. This loss, however, would need to be much less than in the paromomycin-resistant situation where the protein is undetectable. Finally, proofreading by Mto1p·Mss1p may entail a slower overall rate of translation. This would explain the observed higher efficiency of incorporation of radioactive precursor into most of the mitochondrial translation products in the mto1 mutant."
https://openalex.org/W1976259288,"The role of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) in receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)-induced cell growth and transformation was investigated using an inducible epidermal growth factor receptor-Ros chimeric receptor called ER2 and a constitutively activated insulin-like growth factor I receptor called NM1, both of which are able to induce anchorage-independent growth of NIH 3T3 cells. ER2 and NM1 receptor PTKs are able to cause Stat3 activation. Co-expressing the dominant negative Stat3 mutant with ER2 or NM1 in transiently or stable transfected cells resulted in a dramatic inhibition of colonies induced by these receptor PTKs and a moderate inhibition of their mitogenicity in monolayer. Therefore, Stat3 is not only important for initiation of transformation, as demonstrated by inhibition of the epidermal growth factor-inducible colony formation of the ER2 cells by the mutant, but it is also required for the maintenance of transformation, as evidenced by reversion of the NM1 transformed cells. The DNA binding and transcriptional activities of the endogenous Stat3 were greatly inhibited in the ER2 and NM1 cells co-expressing the Stat3 mutants. We conclude that activated function of Stat3 is required for the establishment and maintenance of Ros and insulin-like growth factor I receptor PTK-induced cell transformation.

Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs)1 were originally discovered as transcription factors involved in interferon-induced gene expression (1Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 2Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). The STATs were subsequently shown, also, to be involved in mediating signal transduction of a large number of cytokines that are important for differentiation and maturation of immune cells. Binding of a type I or type II cytokine to its cognate receptor results in its dimerization and recruitment and activation of a specific tyrosine kinase(s) of the Janus kinase (JAK) family. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the cytokine receptor generates sites for the binding of STAT proteins via their SH2 domain. Subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation at the carboxyl domain of STATs catalyzes the dimerization, which is followed by translocation to nucleus, and functions as an activated transcriptional factor. To date, seven STATs (1–6, including 5a and 5b) and four JAKs (1–3 and Tyk2) have been identified in mammalian cells (1Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 2Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). Differential expression and activation of specific cytokine receptors, JAKs, and STATs in different types of cells constitutes the complexity and specificity of the JAK-STAT-mediated signaling and gene regulation in those cells. Recent studies indicate that STATs could also function as effectors for a variety of growth factor receptors, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (3Fu X.-Y. Zhang J.-J.

These observations suggest that STATs may also play a role in receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (RPTK)-mediated functions, including cell growth and differentiation. Moreover, STATs have also been implicated in either promoting or preventing growth arrest and apoptosis (15Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc.

For example, Stat1 is required for EGF-induced expression of cyclin inhibitor p21cip1 and growth arrest of A431 cells (19Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), whereas Stat3 functions in preventing apoptosis of pre-B cells (18Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-tezuka M. Fuijitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGFR) was shown to be able to protect 32D cells from apoptosis upon interleukin 3 withdrawal, and this protection appears to correlate with sustained de novo synthesis of Stat1 and Stat5 (20Zhou-Li F. Xu S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).

Biol. 1997; 17: 3295-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Stat3 is also constitutively activated in v-sisand v-fps-transformed fibroblasts (24Garcia R., Yu, C.-L. Hudnall A. Catlett R. Nelson K.L. Smithgall T. Fujita D.J. Ethier S.P. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1267-1276PubMed Google Scholar). The oncogenic v-abl and Eyk PTKs induce activation of Stats 1, 5, and 6 in pre-B cells (25Danial N.N. Pemis A. Rothman P.B.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), respectively. Furthermore, specific members of STATs were found to be activated in various human tumors and cell lines derived from them (24Garcia R., Yu, C.-L. Hudnall A. Catlett R. Nelson K.L. Smithgall T.

However, direct evidence for the involvement of STATs in oncogene-induced cell transformation has only very recently begun to emerge. Using a dominant negative mutant of Stat1, Zong et al. (31Zong C. Yan R. August A. Darnell Jr., J.E. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) suggested that it plays an important role in EyK-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. This observation, together with previously reported activation of specific STATs by v-src and v-abl, further strengthens the possibility that STATs plays some important role in oncogenic PTK-induced cell transformation. Our laboratory has been interested in exploring the mechanism of cell transformation by oncogenic RPTKs Ros, insulin receptor, and IGFR. v-ros is an oncogenic gag-Ros fusion receptor gene spontaneously transduced by an avian leukosis virus (34Neckameyer W.S. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 879-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have constructed an EGFR-Ros chimeric receptor and shown that it is capable of inducing EGF-dependent transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (35Xiong Q. Chan J.L.-K. Zong C. Wang L.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We have also engineered a constitutively oncogenic gag-IGFR fusion receptor called NM1 and demonstrated its transforming ability in chicken embryo fibroblasts (36Liu D. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 9-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and NIH 3T3 cells. 2W. Li, Y. Jiang, J. Zhang, L. Soon, L. Flechner, V. Kapoor, J. H. Pierce, and L.-H. Wang, submitted for publication.2W. Li, Y. Jiang, J. Zhang, L. Soon, L. Flechner, V. Kapoor, J. H. Pierce, and L.-H. Wang, submitted for publication. Using a temperature-sensitive v-ros mutant, ligand-inducible EGFR-Ros chimeras, and the constitutively activated NM1 gag-IGFR, we have previously observed cell type-specific activation of STAT proteins in chicken embryo fibroblasts and NIH 3T3 cells by Ros and IGFR. 3C. Zong, Y. Jiang, and L.-H. Wang, unpublished data.3C. Zong, Y. Jiang, and L.-H. Wang, unpublished data. To further explore the role of Stat3 in Ros and NM1-induced cell transformation, we have employed dominant negative (dn) mutants of Stat3 to investigate its role in the establishment and maintenance of cell transformation by these oncogenic RPTKs. We report here that both Ros and NM1 activate predominantly Stat3 in NIH 3T3 cells and that Stat3 is required for Ros- and NM1-induced anchorage-independent growth, whereas Stat3 is less critical for the ability of these RPTKs to stimulate cell growth in monolayer. During the course of this study, two reports were published demonstrating that Stat3 plays an essential role in v-src-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. (38Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Overall, these studies provide initial direct evidence for the role of STATs in cell transformation and oncogenesis. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5 or 10% bovine calf serum. Transfection were carried out by standard calcium phosphate method (40Graham F.L. Van Der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (6483) Google Scholar, 41Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 5 × 105/100-mm-diameter dish in DMEM plus 10% calf serum at 18–24 h prior to transfection. Total DNA for transfection was about 10–20 μg of appropriate plasmids per dish plus 20 μg of calf thymus DNA. Transfection was terminated 15 h later by removing the medium and washing twice with fresh medium, and cells were then maintained in the same medium. Stable clones were selected in growth medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.), 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Sigma), or 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), depending on the plasmid used, 48 h after transfection. pECE-ER2 is an EGFR-Ros chimeric receptor construct that induces transformation of NIH 3T3 cells in response to EGF as described previously (35Xiong Q. Chan J.L.-K. Zong C. Wang L.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). phEFER2 and pMV12ER2 were generated by removing the EGFR-Ros insert from the pECE-ER2 construct (35Xiong Q. Chan J.L.-K. Zong C. Wang L.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and it was cloned into the human elongation factor promoter-based neomycin plasmid phEF3 and the Moloney leukemia virus long terminal repeat-driven, hygromycin-resistant plasmid pMV12, separately (42Cacace A.M.

Two reporter plasmids were used: pLucTKS3(38), which contains multimerized Stat3-specific binding sites derived from the human C-reaction protein gene inserted upstream of the TK minimal promoter (kindly given to us by Dr. Richard Jove), and Ly6ELuc (44Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar), which contains three GAS sites from the promoter of the Ly6E gene (kindly given to us by Dr. Curt Horvath). CMV-β-gal plasmid was purchased from Invitrogen. Cell transformation was monitored by anchorage-independent growth in soft agar medium as described previously (45Zong S.C. Poon B. Chan J. Wang L.-H.

If EGF was included in the assay, EGF containing soft agar medium was used for top agar overlay, and DMEM containing EGF was added on top every 5 days. The control dishes were overlaid with regular soft agar medium and subsequently fed with regular DMEM containing 5% calf serum. Protein extraction, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were done according to published procedures (45Zong S.C. Poon B. Chan J. Wang L.-H. J.

Anti-Stat1 (E-23), anti-Stat3 (C-20), anti-Stat5b (C-17), and anti-Flag (D-8) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-P-Tyr (RC20) was purchased from Signal Transduction Laboratories. Cultures of stable transfectants or cells 48 h after transfection were starved for 20 h in serum-free DMEM and then stimulated with EGF for 15 min. Whole cell lysates were prepared from the control and EGF-treated cells. Briefly, after washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were harvested in 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in twice the pellet volume of high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20 mmNaF, 1 mm NaPPi, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 400 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Trasylol, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and were rocked for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations of the clarified lysates were determined by the Bradford assay. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were prepared as described (5Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) oliodeoxynucleotide containing Stat1 and Stat3 binding sites was labeled with [α-32P]dGTP by Klenow end filling and purified by electrophoresis in a 12% nondenaturing gel with a bis:acrylamide ratio of 1:19. The β-CAS oligodeoxynucleotide probe contains the Stat5 binding sequence derived from the rat β-casein gene promoter (50Muli A.L. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). DNA binding was performed by adding 15–20 μg of protein lysate to 18 μl of reaction mixture containing 65 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% Ficoll 400, 4% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Life Science Inc.); the mixture was preincubated on ice for 15 min; and then, approximately 30,000 cpm (1–1.5 ng) of the oligodeoxynucleotide was added to the reaction mixture, which was further incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then analyzed in a 20 × 20-cm 5% polyacrylamide gel with a bis:acrylamide ratio of 1:39 containing 2.5% glycerol and 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris base, 1 mm EDTA). The electrophoresis was carried out at 175 V until the faster migrating bromphenol blue dye was about 4 cm from the bottom edge. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography using Kodak XAR5 film for 1–3 days with intensifying screens at −70 °C. Transcriptional assays were performed by transiently transfecting NIH 3T3 cells with ER2 or NM1 and with either control or dnStat3 together with the reporter plasmid and the pCMV-β-gal plasmid, which served as a control for transfection efficiency. 24 h after transient transfection, the cells were starved for serum overnight, followed by stimulation with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 6 h; the cells were then lysed, and the extract was assayed for luciferase activity with a luminometer according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Promega). Part of the lysate was used for measuring β-galactosidase activity detected by colorimetric assay atA 420 according to the protocol of Sambrooket al. (56Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was normalized to the β-gal activity, serving as an internal control for transfection efficiency. To determine whether STAT proteins are activated by the oncogenic RPTKs Ros and gag-IGFR (NM1), we expressed a ligand-inducible Ros and the constitutively activated NM1 gag-IGFR in NIH 3T3 cells and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of STAT proteins. Activation of the ER2 Ros chimera by EGF led to significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 (Fig. 1 B) This increased tyrosine activation was correlated with increased DNA binding ability of Stat3 (Fig. 1 D). EMSA analysis revealed increase in Stat3 homodimer (SIFA) and Stat3/Stat1 heterodimer (SIFB) binding to the SIE probe upon Ros activation in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions, although the latter was more prominent (Fig. 1 D). There was a basal level of Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation that was largely insensitive to EGF stimulation (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5b was greatly increased upon EGF treatment in control and ER2-expressing cells (Fig. 1 C), implying its activation via endogenous EGFR. This result indicates that activation of Ros does not lead to further activation of Stat5 beyond the level of activation in the control cells. We conclude that Ros is able to specifically activate Stat3 in NIH 3T3 cells. Similar experiments were performed in NM1-expressing NIH 3T3 cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 was most significantly increased by NM1 gag-IGFR (Fig. 2 A). Little effect on Stat1 was observed. Stat5b tyrosine phosphorylation was also increased. DNA binding and mobility shift assay using SIE and β-CAS probes confirmed the activation of Stat3 and Stat5 (Fig. 2 B). Although prominent activation of Stat3 was repeatedly observed, the extent of Stat5 activation was not as significant in other independent experiments (data not shown). Therefore, NM1 is capable of reproducibly activating Stat3 in NIH 3T3 cells. Because both Ros and NM1 PTKs are able to activate Stat3 signaling, we next investigated its potential role in Ros- and NM1-induced cell growth and transformation. For this purpose, we employed the approach of dominant negative mutants to block the endogenous Stat3 function. The Stat3 mutants used here are defective in DNA binding and have been shown to be able to block the wild type Stat3 activity, presumably by forming a nonproductive heterodimer (43Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Dominant negative Stat3 mutants were introduced into the ER2- or NM1-expressing cells. Stable clones co-expressing the oncogenic PTK and a mutant Stat3 were selected using the appropriate drugs. Fig. 3 compares the colony-forming abilities of clones expressing ER2 alone or co-expressing ER2 and the dn mutants. dnStat3-expressing cells formed significantly fewer and smaller colonies compared with the control vector transfected parental ER2 cells. The control and dnStat-expressing lines expressed equivalent amounts of ER2 protein, whereas the dnStat lines expressed about a 2-fold excess of dnStat3 protein (Fig. 3 D) In addition, the ER2 chimeric receptors in all of those clones are equally responsive to EGF stimulation. Upon long-term passages of those stable lines, we observed that some of the clones displayed a reduced expression level of dnStat3 with concurrent loss of inhibition on colony formation (data not shown). Furthermore, the inhibition of Ros-induced colony formation by dnStat3 was also assessed by the transient transfection method (Fig. 4). Three independent experiments were carried out by transiently transfecting the dnStat3 mutant into ER2-expressing cells, which were assayed for colony formation 48 h later. An average of 50% inhibition on colony formation was observed (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 B shows ER2 and dnStat3 protein expression; shown here is a representative one of three experiments. The inhibition by dnStat3 was not due to apoptosis or decreased cell viability, as no reduction in drug-resistant colonies were observed when the transfected cells were subjected to drug selection (data not shown).Figure 4Inhibition of colony-forming ability of the ER2-expressing lines transiently transfected with dnStat3-2.

We found that binding of heterotrimeric fVIIIa (A1·A2·A3-C1-C2) to synthetic vesicles with a physiologic content of 4% phosphatidylserine (PS), 76% phosphatidylcholine, and 20% phosphatidylethanolamine occurs with a 10-fold higher affinity than that of factor VIII (fVIII). The increased affinity of fVIIIa for PS-containing membranes resulted from the reduced rate of fVIIIa dissociation from the vesicles compared with that of fVIII. Similar affinities of A3-C1-C2, A1·A2·A3-C1-C2, and A3-C1-C2·heavy chain for interaction with PS-containing membranes demonstrate that removal of the light chain (LCh) acidic region by thrombin is responsible for these increased affinities of fVIIIa and its derivatives. Similar kinetic parameters of fVIII and its LCh and C2 domain for binding to PS-containing membranes and to activated platelets indicated that the C2 domain is entirely responsible for the interaction of fVIII with membranes. We conclude that the increased fVIIIa affinity for PS-containing membranes is a result of conformational change(s) within the C2 domain upon removal of the acidic region of the LCh. This conclusion is based on the finding that binding of the monoclonal antibody ESH8 to the C2 domain, which is known to prevent this conformational transition, resulted in fVIIIa binding to PS/phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine vesicles (4/76/20) with a lower affinity similar to that of fVIII. In addition, stabilization of the low affinity binding conformation of the C2 domain of fVIIIa by this antibody led to an inhibition of the fVIIIa activity in the factor X activation complex.

The fVIII protein consists of homologous A and C domains and a unique B domain, which are arranged in the order A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 (8Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H. O'Brien D.P. Rotblat F.

The site involved in fVIII binding to synthetic phospholipid vesicles or platelets was localized to the C2 domain residues 2303–2332 (10Arai M. Scandella D. Hoyer L.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The presence of at least 8% phosphatidylserine (PS) is required for fVIII binding to synthetic PS/phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes (11Gilbert G.E. Drinkwater D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9577-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The additional presence of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) induces high affinity binding sites for fVIII on membranes with physiologic (<8%) molar fractions of PS (12Gilbert G.E. Arena A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18500-18505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Expression of fVIII binding sites on platelets occurs only upon their activation by thrombin or other agonists (2Gilbert G.E. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Furie B. Furie B.C. Shattil S.J. J. Biol.

The product, fVIIIa, is a A1·A2·A3-C1-C2 heterotrimer (22Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which domains A1 and A3 retain the metal ion linkage (Fig. 1) and the stable dimer A1·A3-C1-C2 (23Lollar P. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is weakly associated with the A2 subunit mainly through electrostatic forces (22Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spontaneous dissociation of the A2 subunit from the dimer results in nonproteolytic inactivation of fVIIIa. A conformational change(s) occurs within the C2 domain upon removal of the acidic region of the LCh (residues 1649–1689), leading to the loss of the optimal binding conformation of the vWf site within the C2 domain of thrombin-cleaved LCh (A3-C1-C2) (24Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this change(s) could also affect fVIIIa affinity for phospholipid. In this report, we determined the effect of activation of fVIII by thrombin on its binding to synthetic phospholipid PS/PC surfaces with a high content of PS, as well as its binding to phospholipid vesicles containing physiological mole fractions of PS, PE, and PC and to membranes of activated platelets. To elucidate the role of the conformational changes occurring in the C2 domain upon removal of the acidic region of the LCh (24Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we used fragments of fVIII and fVIIIa for measurement of their binding to phospholipids. IgG of monoclonal antibody ESH8 (epitope, C2 residues 2248–2285) was obtained from American Diagnostica. Plasma fVIII was purified from therapeutic concentrates of Method M (American Red Cross) (25Saenko E.L. Shima M. Gilbert G.E. Scandella D. J. Biol.

HCh, LCh, A3-C1-C2 and fVIII HCh·A3-C1-C2 heterodimer were prepared as described previously (24Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol.

The recombinant C2 domain was expressed and purified as described(26). vWf was purified from cryoprecipitate (Cutter Biological) (26Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol.

The concentrations of plasma-derived fVIII, LCh, and HCh were determined by absorbance at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients of 1.2 (28Lollar P. Parker C.G. Tracy R.P.

The molar concentrations of fVIII, HCh, LCh, A3-C1-C2, and A2, were calculated using molecular masses of 300 kDa (8Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H. O'Brien D.P. Rotblat F. Oppermann H.

Molecular masses of HCh·A3-C1-C2 and A1·A2·A3-C1-C2 (Fig. 1) were calculated as the sums of the masses of their components to be 209 and 167 kDa, respectively. Purified fVIIIa, generously provided by Baxter Biotech Group (Duarte, CA), was prepared from recombinant fVIII (31Curtis J.E. Helgerson S.L. Parker E.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6246-6251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated plasma-derived fVIII was prepared by activation of fVIII (2.6 μm) by thrombin (0.1 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl (HEPES-buffered saline) containing 5 mmCaCl2. Activation was stopped by hirudin (0.15 μm), and the pH was adjusted to 6.0 by the addition of 0.2 m MES. Activity of fVIIIa was measured using a chromogenic factor Xase assay (25Saenko E.L. Shima M. Gilbert G.E. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27424-27431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the assay, the limiting concentration of fVIIIa (0.2 nm) (25Saenko E.L. Shima M. Gilbert G.E. Scandella D. J. Biol.

Aliquots were withdrawn after 15, 30, 45, and 60 s, and factor X activation was stopped with 0.05 m EDTA. Factor Xa generation was measured by cleavage of 0.3 mm synthetic substrate S-2765 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using aV max microplate reader (Molecular Devices). A purified factor Xa standard (Enzyme Research Laboratories) was used to convert absorbance (410 nm) into factor Xa concentration. FVIII was iodinated as described (24Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of fVIII was 4 μCi/μg of protein. The activity of 125I-fVIII determined in the one-stage clotting assay (3800 units/μg) was similar to that of unlabeled fVIII. Phospholipids PS, PC, and PE were purchased from Sigma, and biotin-LC-dipalmitoyl-PE was purchased from Pierce. Phospholipid vesicles with various PS, PC, and/or PE content and vesicles containing biotin-LC-dipalmitoyl-PE (0.5%) were prepared as described (32Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The kinetics of protein-phospholipid interaction were determined by surface plasmon resonance using the Biacore biosensor instrument (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) or IAsys biosensor (FISONS, United Kingdom), which measure protein binding and subsequent dissociation in real time (33Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Binding and subsequent dissociation was measured in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 5 mmCaCl2 at 22 °C for all ligands. A supported PS/PC or PC monolayer was formed on the surface of an HPA hydrophobic chip (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by incubation of unilamellar PS/PC (25/75) or 100% PC vesicles at 400 μg/ml in HEPES-buffered saline for 20 min at 22 °C, which produced a signal of 1100 resonance units (RU). The phospholipid-coated chip was blocked by 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 20 min. Binding of fVIII and its derivatives to a supported PS/PC or PC monolayer was measured using the Biacore biosensor instrument, where 1 ng of protein bound per mm2 of the biosensor chip produces a resonance signal of 1000 RU. To regenerate the cuvette, complete dissociation of bound ligands was achieved by the addition of 10 mm NaOH for 30 s. Binding to intact vesicles was measured using the IAsys biosensor, where 1 ng of protein bound per mm2 of the biosensor chip produces a signal of 600 RU. Biotin-coated cuvettes (Affinity Sensors) were incubated with 20 μg/ml streptavidin (Sigma) for 10 min, followed by the addition of biotinylated PS/PC/PE (4/76/20) or PC/PE (80/20) vesicles at 200 μg/ml for 10 min. The resonance response due to binding of biotinylated phospholipid vesicles was 1000 Arc seconds. To regenerate the cuvette, complete dissociation of the biotin-streptavidin complex was achieved by the addition of 5m NaOH for 2 min. The values of the rate constants for the dissociation (k off) of fVIII and its derivatives from monolayers or immobilized intact vesicles were determined by fitting the dissociation kinetics data to the following equation describing a single phase dissociation process,dR/dt=−koffR(Eq. 1) where the surface plasmon resonance signal observed,R, is proportional to the formation of a complex between immobilized component and added ligand.

Aliquots (75 μl) from the samples were loaded onto 20% sucrose (350 μl) and centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 × g. Negative controls contained unactivated platelets and all the other components. The negative control values (≤5% of the maximal binding values) were subtracted from average values of triplicates of all other samples. For heterologous ligand displacement studies, the data were analyzed assuming two distinct equilibria, R +L 1 ⇄ RL 1 and R + L 2 ⇄RL 2, where R is the concentration of fVIII binding sites on activated platelets, L 1is 125I-fVIII, and L 2 is C2, LCh, or A3-C1-C2. These equilibria are described by the equilibrium constantsK d and K i, respectively. The data of homologous and heterologous displacements were fitted to a model assuming a single class of fVIII binding sites on activated platelets using the LIGAND (36Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal.

To determine whether LCh is entirely responsible for the high affinity fVIII interaction with phospholipid membranes, we compared the kinetics of fVIII and LCh binding to and dissociation from immobilized phospholipid monolayers or intact phospholipid vesicles. Values of second order association rate constants (k on) (Table I) were determined from the representative curves (Fig. 2 A) showing the resonance response of fVIII or LCh association with immobilized PS/PC monolayer over time. The half-lives for the dissociation of fVIII or LCh from phospholipid monolayers were approximately 8 min and 7 min, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The k offvalues calculated for fVIII and LCh using the equationk off = ln2/half-life were 1.44 × 10−3 s−1 and 1.65 × 10−3s−1, correspondingly, similar to the respective values calculated for the best fits of the dissociation curves to Equation 1(Table I).Table IKinetic parameters for binding of fVIII and its derivatives to immobilized PS/PC (25/75) monolayerSoluble ligandk onk offK dm−1s−1s−1nmfVIII(6.3 ± 0.6) × 105(1.36 ± 0.04) × 10−32.2 ± 0.21LCh(6.8 ± 0.8) × 105(1.54 ± 0.02) × 10−32.3 ± 0.26C2(7.2 ± 0.04) × 105(2.3 ± 0.09) × 10−33.2 ± 0.25A3-C1-C2(8.8 ± 0.15) × 105(3.5 ± 0.05) × 10−40.4 ± 0.07HCh·A3-C1-C2(7.8 ± 0.12) × 105(2.8 ± 0.04) × 10−40.36 ± 0.06The k on and k off values were derived from individual association (A) and dissociation (B) kinetic curves shown in Figs.

In a control experiment, we examined whether binding characteristics of PS/PC (25/75) monolayers are similar to those of intact vesicles of identical composition. We determined fVIII and LCh parameters for binding to immobilized small unilamellar PS/PC vesicles, containing 0.5% PE-biotin for immobilization to an SA-coated chip via biotin (kinetic data not shown). The k on and k off values for fVIII binding to such vesicles were 6.0 × 105m−1s−1 and 1.22 × 10−3 s−1, while for LCh binding the values were 6.2 × 105m−1 s−1 and 1.38 × 10−3 s−1 and are similar to the corresponding values for fVIII and LCh interaction with the PS/PC monolayer (Table I).

Indeed, LY294002 and wortmannin prevented the effect of PECAM-1/CD31 cross-linking on cell adhesion, at concentrations known to inhibit PI3K without affecting other kinases. Both compounds blocked neutrophil binding to murine fibroblasts transfected with human ICAM-1, to purified ICAM-1 protein, or to fibronectin, suggesting that PECAM-1/CD31-mediated up-regulation of β2 and β1 integrin-mediated adhesion is PI3K-sensitive. We also provide evidence for the association of PECAM-1/CD31 to PI3K, because PI3K was detectable in neutrophil lysates after PECAM-1/CD31 cross-linking and immunoprecipitation. PECAM-1/CD31-dependent recruitment of PI3K was suggested by the finding that the serine/threonine kinase p70 S6 kinase (S6K), a signaling protein downstream of PI3K, is activated in neutrophils upon PECAM-1/CD31 cross-linking, based on the appearance of serine phosphorylation in S6K immunoprecipitates. In turn, S6K is not directly involved in the up-regulation of integrin function because rapamycin, which can inhibit S6K independent of PI3K, did not block PECAM-1/CD31-induced adhesion of neutrophils to β1 and β2 integrin substrates. In conclusion, PECAM-1/CD31 appears to be one of the molecules functionally coupled to PI3K, suggesting that this enzyme may represent a common pathway of integrin and adhesiveness regulation in leukocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1988750935,"Metallothioneins (MT) have been implicated in the protection of cells from oxidative stress. We studied the molecular mechanism of induction of MT-I and MT-II in response to restraint stress using a mouse model system in which the animals were restrained in well ventilated polypropylene tubes for 12 h each day (one cycle). Here, we show that MT-I and MT-II mRNA levels were elevated as much as 10–20-fold after just one cycle of this simple stress. Stress-mediated MT induction occurred at the transcriptional level. The level of MT mRNA correlated with the stress-induced increase, and not with the diurnal variation, in the level of serum glucocorticoid. Treatment of the mice with RU 486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, prior to restraint stress inhibited MT induction by at least 50%. Furthermore, the glucocorticoid responsive element-binding activity in the liver nuclear extracts from the stressed mice was significantly higher than that in the control mice. The complex formations between the transcription factor Sp1, MTF1, or MLTF/ARE and the respective specific oligonucleotides were not altered in the liver from the stressed mouse. The MT mRNA levels returned to the basal level at the end of nine cycles of stress, indicating habituation of the animals to restraint stress. At this stage, exposure of the animals to another type of stress, treatment with heavy metals, resulted in further induction of MT. These data indicate that glucocorticoid is the primary physiological factor responsible for MT induction following restraint stress, and the glucocorticoid receptor is the major transcription factor involved in this process."

The earliest biochemical event following TCR activation is activation of intracellular protein-tyrosine kinases (1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, 2Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation events are regulated by two classes of protein-tyrosine kinases, the Src family (Lck and Fyn) and the Syk/ZAP-70 family. Lck and Fyn phosphorylate tyrosine residues present within a signaling motif in the cytoplasmic regions of the CD3 γ, δ, and ε and TCR ζ chains, called the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. Phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs is followed by the recruitment, tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of ZAP-70 and Syk. This TCR-associated protein-tyrosine kinase activity is coupled to the phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling molecules such as phospholipase Cγ1. Hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids by phospholipase Cγ1 results in the generation of inositol polyphosphates and diacylglycerols, second messengers that lead to activation of protein kinase C family members and to an increased level of intracellular Ca2+. Increased intracellular Ca2+ in turn activates the phosphatase calcineurin, resulting in the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-AT. Another signaling pathway emanating from the TCR involves the small GTP-binding protein Ras and a kinase cascade that it activates (the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway). This pathway results in the activation of the transcription factors Elk1 and subsequently AP-1. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene expression, a common measure of productive T cell activation, cannot be induced by a single signaling pathway: it requires the coordinate action of these and other pathways that integrate at the level of multiple transcription factors, including NF-AT, AP-1, NF-κB, and Oct-1 (3Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Another enzyme that has recently been implicated in TCR signaling is phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase (4Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 5Vanhaesebroeck B. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 249-270PubMed Google Scholar). Class IA PI 3-kinase is a heterodimer composed of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). The regulatory subunit p85 contains an N-terminal SH3 domain, two proline-rich sequences, and two SH2 domains. The SH2 domains bind to phosphorylated tyrosines on receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases and kinase substrates and thus recruit the p85/p110 dimer to activated receptors. The region that separates the two SH2 domains (inter-SH2 domain) mediates the interaction of p85 with the catalytic subunit p110 and is required for PI 3-kinase enzymatic activity. Thus, in activated cells, p110 is targeted to the membrane where its substrates, phosphatidylinositols, reside. In vitro, class IA PI 3-kinase phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the D3 position of the inositol ring, yielding PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, respectively. In eukaryotic cells, PtdIns(3)P is constitutively present, and its levels are largely unaltered upon cellular stimulation. In contrast, PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are nominally absent from resting cells. A wide variety of stimuli induce a rapid appearance of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in intact cells, followed shortly thereafter by PtdIns(3,4)P2 (6Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Thus, the preferred substrate in vivo is likely to be PtdIns(4,5)P2. The rapid appearance of the PI 3-kinase lipid products and their resistance to cleavage by any known phospholipase suggest that they themselves may act as second messengers (7Lips D.L. Majerus P.W. Gorga F.R. Young A.T. Benjamin T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8759-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Serunian L.A. Haber M.T. Fukui T. Kim J.W. Rhee S.G. Lowenstein J.M. Cantley L.C.

Protein kinases Cζ, Cε, Cδ, and Cη are calcium-independent members of the protein kinase family and are activated in vitro by PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (9Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H.

In intact cells, platelet-derived growth factor activates protein kinases Cε and Cλ by a mechanism that requires PI 3-kinase (11Moriya S. Kazlauskas A. Akimoto K. Hirai S. Mizuno K. Takenawa T.

Activation of the serine/threonine kinase p70S6K, which plays an important role in the progression of cells from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, also involves PI 3-kinase (13Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). At this time, the most convincing evidence for a downstream mediator of PI 3-kinase signaling is the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt (14Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,4)P2binds and activates Akt in vitro and in vivo. This requires that Akt have a functional pleckstrin homology domain, leading to the hypothesis that binding of the lipid to the pleckstrin homology domain targets Akt to the membrane where activating phosphorylation events, which are also PI 3-kinase-dependent, take place. Recently, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, a protein kinase that phosphorylates Akt on one of the two sites required for Akt activity, has been purified and cloned (15Alessi D.R. James S.R.

Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 has a pleckstrin homology domain and is activated by PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. One substrate of Akt in vivo is glycogen-synthase kinase-3 (18Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Glycogen-synthase kinase-3 phosphorylates NF-AT, resulting in nuclear exit of NF-AT and thus opposing the effect of calcineurin (19Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of glycogen-synthase kinase-3 by Akt inactivates glycogen-synthase kinase-3, allowing nuclear localization of NF-AT and transcription of NF-AT-dependent genes such as IL-2. The Bcl-2 family member Bad is another in vivo substrate of Akt; phosphorylation of Bad blocks its death-promoting activity and results in cell survival (20del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C.

In T cells, PI 3-kinase associates with the TCR upon activation due to either a direct interaction between p85 and the phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif of the ζ (22Exley M.

Cai Y.C. da Silva A.J. Raab M. Prasad K.V. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Once bound, PI 3-kinase becomes activated, resulting in the accumulation of PI 3-kinase products (26Ward S.G. Ley S.C. MacPhee C. Cantrell D.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). One study with the Jurkat T cell line has suggested that inhibition of PI 3-kinase actually induces IL-2 production in the absence of any other stimulus (27Ueda Y. Levine B.L. Huang M.L. Freeman G.J. Nadler L.M. June C.H. Ward S.G. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas another study found that blocking PI 3-kinase inhibits IL-2 production (28Shi J. Cinek T. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4688-4695PubMed Google Scholar). To address the physiologic role of PI 3-kinase in coupling TCR signaling to transcription of the IL-2 gene, we have used a combination of pharmacological and molecular approaches to characterize its role in primary lymph node T cells. We find that activation of PI 3-kinase is in fact essential for ERK activation and the initiation of IL-2 gene transcription and that this requirement cannot be bypassed by independent activation of Akt. (C57BL/6 × B10.D2)F1mice were intercrossed for 17–19 generations. Animals of either sex were killed at 6–10 weeks of age, and single cell suspensions of lymph nodes were prepared. Cells were assayed in RPMI 1640 medium (Biofluids, Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 150 μg/ml gentamicin, and 5 × 10−5m2-mercaptoethanol. 145-2C11 (2C11) is a hamster monoclonal antibody against mouse CD3-ε and was purified from culture supernatant by affinity chromatography with protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA). The anti-p85 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-ZAP-70 antibody 1213 and the ZAP-70 substrate cytoplasmic fragment of band 3 protein (cfb3) were a kind gift of Dr. Ron Wange (NIA, National Institutes of Health). Anti-ERK-2 and anti-MEK-1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Wortmannin and LY294002 were purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin were purchased from Sigma. The cDNAs encoding murine p85α and p110 were a generous gift of Drs. Lewis Williams and Anke Klippel (Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA). The 5′-IL-2-luciferase reporter plasmid containing the IL-2 minimal promoter and enhancer (nucleotides −353 to +38 of the murine IL-2 gene) upstream of the luciferase gene was kindly provided by Dr. Jack Ragheb (NIAID, National Institutes of Health). The AP-1-luciferase construct contains six copies of the mouse proximal AP-1 site (at nucleotide −150), and the NF-AT-luciferase construct contains three copies of the distal NF-AT-binding site (at nucleotide −280) from the murine IL-2 gene (29Petrak D. Memon S.A. Birrer M.J. Ashwell J.D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2046-2051PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding histidine-tagged kinase-inactive ERK-2 (K52R) was kindly provided by Dr. Melanie Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). The fusion protein was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA). For transfection experiments, the coding sequences for p85α and p110 were subcloned into the expression vector pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI). To generate the deletion mutant Δp85, two polymerase chain reaction fragments were amplified from p85α cDNA: A1 (nucleotides 774–1386; flanked by BsmI and BglII restriction sites) and A2 (nucleotides 1693–2232; flanked by BglII and BamHI restriction sites). These two polymerase chain reaction fragments, together with a fragment of p85α (from 9 nucleotides upstream of ATG to nucleotide 783; flanked by XbaI and BsmI restriction sites), were cloned into pBluescript SK (II)+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate Δp85. Δp85 was then subcloned into pCI-neo (pCI-Δp85). Expression of this mutant results in the deletion of 102 amino acids from residues 466 to 567 of p85α and the insertion of 2 other amino acids (Arg-Ser) in this deleted position due to the cloning procedure. The correct sequence of Δp85 was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. One additional amino acid (Ser) was present at the deletion site. The cDNA encoding v-Akt (30Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), the constitutively active viral homologue of c-Akt, was subcloned into pCI-neo (pCI-v-Akt). 105 lymph node cells/well were plated in 96-well plates. The cells were stimulated as indicated (with or without pretreatment with inhibitor) and then cultured. Aliquots of the supernatant were removed in triplicate at the indicated time and assayed for IL-2 using a mouse IL-2 immunoassay (Quantikine M, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). In vitro translated proteins were prepared using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) using 30 μCi of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol)/sample. Typically, 0.5 μg of circular plasmid DNA was used. After 1.5 h at 30 °C, the in vitro translated proteins were either immediately analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or first immunoprecipitated and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to detect protein-protein interactions. Lymph node cells were cultured in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (2 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μg/ml). After 2 days, the cells were washed, resuspended in fresh medium containing IL-2 (10 units/ml), and cultured for 1 additional day. Prior to transfection, the T cell blasts were washed in medium and resuspended at 50–75 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 mm HEPES and 4 mmglutamine. 0.2 ml of the cell suspension was mixed with the indicated amounts of plasmid DNA in electroporation cuvettes (0.4-cm electrode gap; Bio-Rad). Electroporation was performed at 960 microfarads and 250 V using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. The cells were then transferred into complete medium with 20 mm HEPES. The transfected cells were aliquoted into 24-well plates and cultured at 37 °C for 3–6 h. Then, the cells were transferred to 24-well plates that had been coated with 2C11 (20 μg/ml). After 12–14 h, the cells were harvested from the wells; transferred to microcentrifuge tubes; centrifuged; and lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mmEDTA, and 1% Triton X-100. Samples (20 μl) were then analyzed for luciferase activity. After treatment with soluble 2C11 (10 μg/ml) for the indicated time, cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Lysates were then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads that had been preincubated with polyclonal anti-ZAP-70 antibody. After 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer. The beads were then subjected to a ZAP-70 kinase assay with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 10 mmMnCl2 (ZAP-70 kinase buffer) using 1 μg of Cfb3 as a substrate. After incubating the beads at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After treatment with soluble 2C11 (10 μg/ml) for the indicated time periods, cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Lysates were then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads that had been preincubated with polyclonal anti-ERK-2 antibody. After 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer. The kinase reaction was carried out in 30 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, and 2 mm EGTA (MAPK kinase buffer) containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After treatment with soluble 2C11 (10 μg/ml) for the indicated time periods, cells were lysed in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min. Lysates were then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads that had been preincubated with polyclonal anti-MEK-1 antibody. After 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgAc. The kinase reaction was carried out in 25 μl of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgAc, 40 μm ATP, and 2 mm dithiothreitol containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 80 μg/ml purified kinase-inactive ERK-2 (K52R) at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Filters were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 10% nonfat dried milk. The respective antibodies were added in phosphate-buffered saline at appropriate dilutions. Bound antibody was detected with anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, England) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, washed, and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The effects of wortmannin, a fungal metabolite that irreversibly blocks PI 3-kinase catalytic activity (31Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 32Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol.

Freshly isolated murine lymph node cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody in the presence of increasing concentrations of wortmannin, and IL-2 was measured (Fig. 1 A). Wortmannin inhibited TCR-induced IL-2 production in a dose-dependent fashion, with half-maximal inhibition at a concentration of ∼20 nm and complete inhibition at 100 nm, concentrations of wortmannin that inhibit PI 3-kinase activity (33Wymann M. Arcaro A. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,34Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since wortmannin can inhibit at least two other enzymes, PI 4-kinase (35Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 36Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and phospholipase A2 (37Cross M.J. Stewart A. Hodgkin M.N. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25352-25355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), at nanomolar concentrations, it is possible that the effect of this reagent on T cell activation was independent of its ability to inhibit PI 3-kinase. Therefore, similar experiments were performed with the structurally unrelated PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (38Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). As with wortmannin, LY294002 inhibited IL-2 production at concentrations that completely and specifically abolish PI 3-kinase activity (38Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither wortmannin nor LY294002 was toxic at the concentrations used, as determined by staining with trypan blue (data not shown). These results indicate that PI 3-kinase activity is necessary for IL-2 production in lymph node T cells following activation via the TCR. To further explore the relationship between PI 3-kinase and activation-induced IL-2 production, a dominant-negative form of p85 was used to inhibit the function of endogenous PI 3-kinase (39Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 40Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). We constructed a deletion mutant of p85 (Δp85) lacking 102 amino acids of the inter-SH2 domain that confers binding to p110 (41Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hu Q. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5560-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 42Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To verify the absence of binding of Δp85 to p110, Δp85 and p110 were transcribed and cotranslated in a reticulocyte translation system in the presence of [35S]methionine. Δp85 was immunoprecipitated from the lysate, and the immunoprecipitate was analyzed for the presence of p110 (Fig. 2 A). When wild-type p85 and p110 were cotranslated, anti-p85 antibodies brought down both p85 and p110. In contrast, immunoprecipitation of Δp85 from lysates in which Δp85 and p110 were cotranslated resulted in the appearance of only Δp85. Therefore, the deletion of the inter-SH2 region of p85 did in fact disrupt the interaction between these two molecules. To determine what effect repression of enzymatic function by dominant-negative Δp85 would have on activation-dependent signaling, T cell blasts were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid containing the minimal IL-2 promoter/enhancer upstream of the luciferase gene and either an empty vector or a vector encoding Δp85. The transfected cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody, and induction of luciferase activity was assessed (Fig. 2 B). As expected, the IL-2-luciferase reporter was induced by 2C11. When Δp85 was coexpressed, however, the anti-CD3 antibody-induced IL-2 activity was almost completely inhibited (87% inhibition). Importantly, when the Δp85-transfected T cell blasts were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, reagents that bypass the TCR to induce new gene transcription, IL-2-luciferase induction was not inhibited by Δp85. In addition, treatment of T cell blasts that had been transfected with the IL-2-luciferase reporter construct with wortmannin before stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody also inhibited IL-2 promoter activity (81% inhibition) (Fig. 2 C). As a control, cells were cotransfected with a β-galactosidase expression plasmid, and β-galactosidase activity was measured in the same cell extracts used to analyze luciferase activity. In all samples analyzed, β-galactosidase activity never varied >2-fold. These results indicate that PI 3-kinase is a necessary mediator in TCR signaling for IL-2 gene transcription. The IL-2 promoter contains binding sites for members of the NF-AT and AP-1 families of transcription factors (3Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin.

Once in the nucleus, NF-AT and AP-1 form a functional transcription factor complex (43Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Besides binding to the NF-AT/AP-1 site, AP-1 also binds to the Oct/AP-1 site and to its own site. It thus participates in IL-2 gene transcription by binding to multiple regulatory regions. To explore whether PI 3-kinase activity was required for transcriptional activation of NF-AT or AP-1, we analyzed the effect of Δp85 on the activation of NF-AT- and AP-1-luciferase reporter constructs in transient transfection assays. Δp85 inhibited the anti-CD3 antibody-induced NF-AT and AP-1 activities (98 and 89% inhibition, respectively) (Fig. 3, A and C). In addition, pretreatment with wortmannin inhibited the anti-CD3 antibody-induced NF-AT and AP-1 activation by 83 and 77%, respectively (Fig. 3, B and D). The earliest biochemical response to TCR ligation is the sequential activation of protein-tyrosine kinases: first Src family kinases and then the Syk/ZAP-70 family. Therefore, to determine if inhibition of PI 3-kinase interfered at a very proximal level of signaling, lymph node cells were treated with 100 nm wortmannin prior to stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody. After stimulation, ZAP-70 was immunoprecipitated, and its kinase activity was assessed by measuring the phosphorylation of a 43-kDa substrate (cfb3). Wortmannin, at a concentration that inhibited IL-2 production and transactivation of IL-2, NF-AT, and AP-1 reporters, had no effect on the anti-CD3 antibody-induced activity of ZAP-70 (Fig. 4). A prominent component of the signaling cascade downstream of the activated TCR and leading to IL-2 production is the ERK pathway. ERKs are serine/threonine kinases involved in the activation of AP-1, a transcription factor essential for IL-2 gene transcription. Therefore, the effects of wortmannin and LY294002 on ERK activation following anti-CD3 antibody activation were assessed. Freshly isolated lymph node cells were treated with wortmannin or LY294002 and then activated with anti-CD3 antibody. ERK-2 was immunoprecipitated, and its kinase activity was analyzed using myelin basic protein as a substrate. As expected, ERK-2 was activated by anti-CD3 antibody"
https://openalex.org/W2024360304,"Many growth factors and G protein-coupled receptors activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways. The MAP kinase pathways are involved in the regulation of the ubiquitous process of apoptosis or programmed cell death. Two related MAP kinase kinase kinases, apoptosis-signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and MAP kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), stimulate c-Jun kinase (JNK) activity and induce apoptosis. Transient transfection of dominant negative and constitutively active components of the JNK pathway in COS-7 cells showed that two G protein subunits, Gα12 and Gα13, stimulated the JNK pathway in a ASK1- and MEKK1-dependent manner. Moreover, the mutationally activated Gα12 and Gα13 stimulated the kinase activity of ASK1. Both Gα12 and Gα13 employ small GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac1, to transduce signal to MEKK1 and, subsequently, to JNK. However, activation of JNK by Cdc42 and Rac1 did not require ASK1. Additionally, ASK1 and MEKK1 are involved in the apoptosis induced by Gα12 and Gα13. We conclude that Gα12 and Gα13 can induce apoptosis using two separate MAP kinase pathways; one is initiated by ASK1, and the other is initiated by MEKK1. Furthermore, Bcl-2 can block apoptosis induced by Gα12 and Gα13. This death-sparing function was associated with increased Bcl-2 phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation of Bcl-2 may be a critical mechanism protecting cells from Gα12- and Gα13-induced apoptosis.

Activated MAPK may translocate to the cell nucleus and regulate the activities of transcription factors, thereby controlling gene expression. At least two defined MAP kinase signaling modules function in mammalian cells: the Raf-MEK-ERK, or ERK, pathway (3Davis R.J. Trends Biochem.

Among the important functions of G proteins, their involvement in the regulation of cell growth and mitogenesis contrasts with their signaling of apoptosis. Thus, activating mutations in Gαs and Gαi2 genes are found in specific subsets of human tumors (16Lyons J. Landis C.A. Harsh G. Vallar L. Grünewald K. Feichtinger H. Duh Q.Y. Clark O.H. Kawasaki E.

In this study, we have analyzed the molecular mechanisms of signaling of apoptosis induced by Gα12 and Gα13. We found that both activation of JNK and apoptosis induced by Gα12 and Gα13 are mediated by two MAPKK kinases, MEKK1 and ASK1. We also observed that Bcl-2 inhibited apoptosis induced by Gα12 and Gα13. The results suggest that phosphorylation of Bcl-2 may be involved in the protective effect against apoptosis induced by Gα12 and Gα13. Protein A-agarose was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Antibodies to Bcl-2, Gα12, Gα13, MEKK1, and 9E10 antibody to c-Myc epitope were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).

Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 was a gift from David Ucker (University of Illinois, Chicago). The C terminus of ASK1 was tagged with HA epitope. Briefly, ASK1 was excised from pcDNA3 using XhoI and BstBI restriction enzymes. Next, purified ASK1 DNA fragment was ligated with pcDNA3 in the presence of annealed oligonucleotides encoding the HA epitope. The sequences of the oligonucleotides encoding the HA epitope were as follows: CGAAGTTATGATGTTCCTGATTATGCTTGAT (upper strand) and CTAGATCAAGCATAATCAGGAACATCATAACTT (lower strand). The sequence of the resulting construct was confirmed using restriction and sequencing analysis. COS-7 cells and human kidney embryonic 293 (HEK293) cells were propagated and transfected using the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method, as described previously (23Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M. Ahn N.

To maintain uniform amount of transfected DNA, empty vector was added to the transfection mixture when necessary. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were used in the experiments. JNK activity was determined as described previously (23Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M. Ahn N. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, HA-tagged JNK was transfected in the presence of various cDNA constructs as described under “Results.” Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed, and JNK-HA was immunoprecipitated using 12CA5 antibody and protein A-agarose. The kinase activity of JNK-HA was measured using recombinant c-Jun as a substrate. Recombinant c-Jun was produced in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein expressed from plasmid pGEX-c-Jun (23Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M. Ahn N. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

The kinase reaction was terminated with Laemmli buffer, proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, phosphorylated c-Jun was visualized by autoradiography, and radioactivity was quantitated with a Molecular Imager System (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of whole cell lysates from the same experiments were subjected to immunoblotting analysis to confirm the appropriate expression of transfected proteins as described under “Results.” ASK1-HA was transfected in the presence of various cDNA constructs as described under “Results.” Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μm sodium orthovanadate with 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptine, and 1 μm pepstatin for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 antibody and protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. To measure kinase activity of ASK1-HA, 0.2 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-MKK6 was incubated with the immune complexes for 20 min at 30 °C in buffer containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 50 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Recombinant catalytically inactive MKK6 was produced in E. coli as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein expressed from the plasmid pGEX—MKK6(KN). The kinase reaction was terminated with Laemmli buffer, proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, phosphorylated MKK6 was visualized by autoradiography, and radioactivity was quantitated with a Molecular Imager System (Bio-Rad). The HA epitope did not alter the signaling functions of ASK1 based on the following observations. Titration experiments showed that comparable activation of the endogenous JNK can be achieved after transient transfection of either wild type ASK1 or HA-tagged ASK1 (data not shown). Aliquots of whole cell lysates from the same experiments were subjected to immunoblotting analysis to confirm the appropriate expression of transfected proteins as described under “Results.” Bcl-2 was transfected in the presence of various cDNA constructs as described under “Results,” and each transfection was performed on 2 × 106 cells in a 60-mm dish. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were transferred into two wells of a six-well plate. For each transfection, one well was used for Bcl-2 phosphorylation assay, and the other was used for immunoblotting analysis to confirm the appropriate expression of transfected proteins. Cells were labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid in phosphate-free medium for 16 h. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer, and Bcl-2 protein was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of Bcl-2 antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. The proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and visualized by autoradiography, and radioactivity was quantitated with a Molecular Imager System (Bio-Rad). The same blot was then probed with Bcl-2 antibody and developed using the ECL kit. For apoptosis analysis, cells were co-transfected with cDNA encoding β-galactosidase. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were transferred into two wells of a six-well plate. Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed 48 h after transfection with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Staining for fragmented genomic DNA with the Apoptag Plus kit was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. β-Galactosidase was stained with β-galactosidase antibody (15 μg/ml) for 1 h followed by a rabbit rhodamine-conjugated IgG for 30 min. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize cell nuclei. Cells were counted using a Nikon inverted model 200 microscope; 200–600 cells were counted in each experiment. Aliquots of whole cell lysates from the same transfections were subjected to immunoblotting analysis to confirm the appropriate expression of transfected proteins as described under “Results.” cAMP accumulation was determined as described previously (19Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2559-2565PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, cells were reseeded onto 24-well plates and labeled with [3H]adenine (2 μCi/ml) for 24 h. For measuring cAMP accumulation, cells were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated (37 °C for 30 min) in the same medium containing 1 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. Reactions were terminated by aspiration and the immediate addition of 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic asid. Acid-soluble nucleotides were separated on ion exchange columns as described (19Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R.

In addition, both α-subunits employ small GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac (23Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M. Ahn N. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) to transduce signal to JNK. To examine if, in addition to MEKK1, other members of the MAP kinase family can mediate the regulation of JNK activity by Gα12 and Gα13, we used expression vectors encoding wild type and dominant negative ASK1. The substitution of Lys709 to arginine makes ASK1 dominant negative; this mutant can prevent both activation of JNK and apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α and actinomycin D in lung epithelial cells (14Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K., K., M. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of ASK1 in the signaling pathways regulated by Gα12 and Gα13, JNK-HA activity was measured in COS-7 cells expressing different amounts of wild type ASK1 and dominant negative ASK1(K709R) (Fig. 1). In this model system, transient expression of wild type ASK1 dramatically stimulated JNK activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Titration experiments indicated that a 5-fold stimulation of JNK activity was observed with 100 ng of ASK1 plasmid. JNK activity was not changed with 200 ng of ASK1(K709R) plasmid. A further increase of ASK1(K709R) cDNA resulted in modest activation of JNK (Fig. 1). To dissect the regulation of ASK1 activity, we tested in our subsequent experiments the effect of upstream molecules by cotransfection with 100 ng/transfection of ASK1 cDNA or 200 ng/transfection of ASK1(K709R) cDNA. To evaluate how ASK1 is involved in the activation of JNK by Gα12 and Gα13, we measured JNK-HA activity in cells expressing wild type and constitutively activated Gα12 and Gα13 and wild type and dominant negative ASK1 (Fig. 2). Consistent with previous results showing that Gα12 and Gα13 activate the JNK pathway (23Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M. Ahn N. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Prasad M.V.V.S. Dermott J.M. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol.

Co-expression of the α-subunits with ASK1 resulted in additive increases in JNK activity. In contrast, dominant negative ASK1(K709R) inhibited JNK activation induced by both Gα12 and Gα13 (Fig. 2,graphs). Expression of JNK-HA protein remained unchanged in all experimental conditions as judged by the immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 2, graphs). This result indicates that changes in the JNK-HA activity are not due to changes in JNK-HA expression. Similarly, expression of Gα12, Gα13, ASK1, or ASK1(K709R) proteins remained unchanged after co-expression with indicated cDNA constructs as it was determined by the immunoblotting analysis with polyclonal antibodies to Gα12, Gα13, or ASK1 (Fig. 2, graphs). Thus, in addition to MEKK1 (23Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M. Ahn N. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) Gα12 and Gα13 appear to stimulate JNK via ASK1. To examine how Gα12 and Gα13 affect the kinase activity of ASK1, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with ASK1 tagged with the HA epitope (ASK1-HA) at the C terminus. After immunoprecipitation with 12CA5 antibody and kinase assay with an exogenous substrate, we found that constitutively activated forms of both G proteins stimulated ASK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of MKK6 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In agreement with previous observations (14Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K., K., M. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar), stimulation of the cells with tumor necrosis factor-α for 30 min also resulted in ASK1 activation. Dominant negative ASK1(K709R) inhibited ASK1 activation induced by Gα12, Gα13, and tumor necrosis factor-α (Fig. 3). Control immunoblotting from the same lysates confirmed appropriate expression from transfected plasmids (Fig. 3), indicating that Gα12 and Gα13 stimulate kinase activity of ASK1 in vivo. Small GTPases, Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA regulate the activity of the JNK pathway (27Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Because Gα12 and Gα13 regulate JNK activity via Cdc42 and Rac1 (23Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M. Ahn N. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we investigated if Cdc42 and Rac1 employ the serine/threonine kinase ASK1 to stimulate JNK. Co-expression of constitutively activated Cdc42(V12) with ASK1 resulted in a synergistic increase of JNK activity (Fig. 4 A). In addition, dominant negative ASK1(K709R) did not affect JNK activation induced by Cdc42(V12) (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, co-expression of constitutively activated Rac1(V12) with ASK1 resulted in a synergistic increase of the JNK activity (Fig. 4 A). Finally, dominant negative ASK1(K709R) did not affect the JNK activation induced by Rac1(V12) (Fig. 4 A). The expression of JNK-HA protein remained unchanged in all experimental conditions as it was judged by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 4 A, graph), indicating that observed changes in the JNK-HA activity are not due to changes in JNK-HA expression. Control immunoblotting from the same lysates confirmed appropriate expression of the wild type and mutant ASK1, Cdc42(V12), and Rac(V12) from transfected plasmids (Fig. 4 A, graph), suggesting that small G proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 and serine/threonine kinase ASK1 use different pathways to stimulate JNK. To confirm that ASK1 is not involved in the pathway that leads from Cdc42 and Rac to stimulation of JNK, the ASK1 activity was measured in the cells expressing activated Cdc42 and Rac (Fig. 4 B). Our results showed that co-expression of either Cdc42(V12) or Rac(V12) with ASK1-HA did not result in increased catalytic activity of the tested kinase (Fig. 4 B). At the same time, immunoblotting analysis of the total cell lysates showed the appropriate expression of the proteins from the transfected plasmids (Fig. 4 B, graph). At the same time, dominant negative MEKK1(K432A) inhibited JNK activation induced by both Cdc42(V12) and Rac1(V12) (Fig. 4 C). Finally, expression of Cdc42(V12) or Rac(V12) proteins remained unchanged after co-expression with ASK1 or ASK1(K709R) as determined by the immunoblotting analysis with 910E antibody (Fig. 4 C, graph). Taken together, these results indicate that Cdc42 and Rac1 stimulate JNK via MEKK1 but not via ASK1. To study the apoptosis induced by Gα12 and Gα13, β-galactosidase cDNA was co-transfected with the various α-subunits. Twenty-four and 48 h after transfection, the extent of cell death was estimated measuring the number of cells with fragmented DNA using the Apoptag Plus kit (Fig. 5, A–C). Constitutively activated Gα12 and Gα13 induced apoptosis in 25–30% of the cells (Fig. 5 D). Apoptosis induced by wild type Gα12 and Gα13 was less pronounced. To study the specificity of apoptotic response induced by Gα12 and Gα13, constitutively activated Gαs(Q227L) was used. Gαs(Q227L) did not induce apoptosis when transiently transfected into COS-7 cells (Fig. 5 D). In the same cells, Gαs(Q227L) induced a 6-fold increase in cAMP accumulation (Fig. 5 E), confirming the functional activity of the expressed protein. We next examined if serine/threonine kinases ASK1 and MEKK1 are involved in the apoptosis induced by Gα12 and Gα13. Co-expression of the tested α-subunits with ASK1 resulted in an additive increase in apoptosis (Fig. 6, A and B). Moreover, dominant negative ASK1(K709R) inhibited apoptosis induced by Gα12 and Gα13 by 50–60% (Fig. 6,A and B). Similarly, co-expression of the tested α-subunits with MEKK1 resulted in additive increase in apoptosis (Fig. 6, A and B). Additionally, dominant negative MEKK1(K432A) inhibited apoptosis induced by Gα12 and Gα13 by 50–60% (Fig. 6, A and B). Immunoblotting analysis from the same lysates confirmed appropriate expression of the proteins from transfected plasmids (Fig. 6, A and B, graphs), indicating that apoptosis induced by Gα12 and Gα13 is mediated by both ASK1 and MEKK1. The protooncogene Bcl-2 functions as an apoptosis suppresser in many systems (29Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar), although its mechanism of action is not yet known. Emerging data imply that members of the Bcl-2 gene family are targets for phosphorylation, suggesting one potential mechanism of control (10Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 12Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Magnenat E. Camps M. Muda M. Chabert C. Gillieron C. Boschert U.

Co-expression of Bcl-2 with constitutively activated Gα12 and Gα13 almost completely abolished apoptosis induced by these α-subunits (Fig. 7 A). Immunoblotting analysis revealed endogenously expressed Gα12 and Gα13 in COS-7 cells. The amount of the G protein α-subunits was apparently increased in the cells transfected with cDNAs encoding Gα12 or Gα13. At the same, the commercial antiserum for Bcl-2 failed to detect endogenous Bcl-2 protein; however, the transfected Bcl-2 protein was readily detectable (Fig. 7 A, graph). We investigated if the phosphorylation state of Bcl-2 was affected by Gα12 and Gα13. Following metabolic labeling with inorganic32P, Bcl-2 could be identified as a phosphoprotein (Fig. 7 B). Incorporation of labeled phosphate into Bcl-2 in the cells expressing Gα12 and Gα13 was significantly higher. However, the amount of Bcl-2 protein expressed in the same experimental conditions remained unchanged as tested with Western blotting analysis (Fig. 7 B), indicating a net increase in Bcl-2 phosphorylation. These data show that G protein-induced apoptosis was suppressed by Bcl-2 and that this sparing effect was associated with Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Our results allow us to draw three new conclusions with respect to the effects of Gα12 and Gα13 on downstream signaling pathways. These proteins (a) activate MAPKK kinase ASK1 in a Cdc42- and Rac1-independent manner; (b) induce apoptosis by a mechanism that involves MEKK1 and ASK1; and (c) induce the phosphorylation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. In the present investigation, we characterized a new signaling pathway that is regulated by Gα12 and Gα13. Recently identified MAPKK kinase ASK1 activates MKK4 and MKK6, which in turn activate JNK and p38 MAPK, respectively (14Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K., K., M. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). In addition, ASK1 is activated by tumor necrosis factor-α and induces apoptosis (14Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K., K., M. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). We tested if ASK1 is regulated by α-subunits of heterotrimeric G12 and G13 proteins. Our data show that in transient transfection experiments, constitutively activated mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 proteins stimulate the kinase activity of ASK1 (Figs. 3 and 8). In our previous work, we showed that Gα12 and Gα13 stimulate JNK via MEKK1 (23Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M. Ahn N. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We now show that Gα12 and Gα13 stimulate JNK via ASK1 in addition to MEKK1 (Figs. 2 and 8). The MAP kinase pathways (ERK and JNK) are typically regulated by small G proteins: Ras in the case of the ERK pathway (34Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 35van Aelst L. Barr M. Marcus S. Polverino A. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6213-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and Cdc42, Rac, and Rho (27Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 28Teramoto H. Crespo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) in the case of the JNK pathway. Moreover, regulation of these MAP kinase pathways by heterotrimeric G proteins seems to require activation of the small G proteins mentioned above. Thus, Gi-dependent activation of ERK requires Ras (36Pace A.M. Faure M. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and G12/G13-dependent regulation of JNK requires Cdc42 (23Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M. Ahn N. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or Rac (26Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated if (a) Cdc42 and Rac stimulate JNK via ASK1 and (b) if G12/G13-dependent activation of ASK1 requires Cdc42 or Rac1. Our results show that Gα12 and Gα13 stimulate ASK1 independently of Cdc42 or Rac1 (Fig. 4). Finally, stimulation of the JNK by Cdc42 and Rac1 occurs by a mechanism that requires MEKK1 but not ASK1 (Figs. 4 and 8). Whether small G proteins can regulate ASK1 activity remains to be investigated. Several lines of evidence suggest that heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in the regulation of apoptosis in mammalian cells as follows. (a) G protein-coupled receptors can either prevent or induce apoptosis. Somatostatin receptor type 3 and purinergic receptor P2Y2 induce apoptosis in different cell systems (37Sharma K. Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 38Apasov S.G. Koshiba M. Chused T.M. Sitkovsky M.V. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5095-5105PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors blocks apoptosis of cultured cerebellar neurons (39Yan G.M. Lin S.Z. Irwin R.P. Paul S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 248-257PubMed Google Scholar). (b) Small G proteins, such as Ha-Ras, R-Ras, Rho, and Rac, which are regulated by heterotrimeric G proteins (among other stimuli), induce apoptosis in certain cell systems. For example, two small G proteins, R-Ras and Rho, induce apoptosis in cultured cells via a Bcl-2-suppressible mechanism (40Jimenez B. Arends M. Esteve P. Perona R. Sanchez R. Cajal S.R. Wyllie A. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 811-816PubMed Google Scholar, 41Wang H.G. Millan J.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Rapp U.R. Beck T. Zha H. Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Additionally, in human leukemic Jurkat cells, apoptosis induced by ceramide and Fas ligand was blocked after inhibition of Ras, Rac1, or JNK/p38 MAPK (42Brenner B. Koppenhoefer U. Weinstock C. Linderkamp O. Lang F. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22173-22181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 43Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Brenner B. Schlottmann K. Linderkamp O. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26389-26394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Finally, genetic inhibition of Ras and Rac by dominant negative N17Ras and N17Rac, antisense oligonucleotides to Rac, or cellular treatment with Botulinus C3 exoenzyme prevent Ras stimulation as well as apoptosis after Fas receptor stimulation (43Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Brenner B. Schlottmann K. Linderkamp O. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26389-26394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). (c) The JNK/p38 MAPK pathways, which are regulated by heterotrimeric G proteins (among other stimuli), cause apoptosis in certain cell systems. Thus, persistent activation of JNK is involved in the initiation of the apoptosis (13Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar,44Chen Y.R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). (d) Apoptosis induced by familial Alzheimer's disease-associated mutants of the amyloid precursor protein is mediated by the Go protein (20Yamatsuji T. Matsui T. Okamoto T. Komatsuzaki K. Takeda S. Fukumoto H. Iwatsubo T. Suzuki N. Asami-Okada A. Ireland S. Kinane T.B. Giambarella U. Nishimoto I. Science. 1996; 272: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). A recent report by Althoefer (21Althoefer H. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24380-24386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) shows that Gαq and Gα13 induce apoptosis that is Bcl-2 suppressible and does not require serum deprivation (21Althoefer H. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24380-24386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we found that constitutively activated Gα12 and Gα13 induce apoptosis in COS-7 (Fig. 5) and HEK293 cells (data not shown). In addition, we found that apoptosis induced by Gα12 and Gα13 was executed by a MEKK1- and ASK1-dependent mechanism (Fig. 6). We also found that ASK1 is a more potent inducer of apoptosis than MEKK1 (Fig. 6); to induce an equal amount of apoptotic cells, 10 times more MEKK1 was required than ASK1 (Fig. 6). However, the mechanism by which ASK1 induces apoptosis is unknown. One possibility is that, similarly to MEKK1 (45Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frish S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), ASK1 activation by caspase cleavage will be required for apoptotic response. In the Bcl-2 family of proteins, both repressors and promoters of apoptosis are found (46Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Farrow S.N. Brown R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Mcl-1, and A1 inhibit apoptosis, whereas Bax, Bcl-xs, Bak, and Bad promote apoptosis. These proteins can form homo- and heterodimers that are important in determining sensitivity to apoptotic signals (46Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,48Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5853) Google Scholar). Additionally, phosphorylation of Bcl-2 is required for its antiapoptotic function in some instances (10Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Thus, removal of putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites eliminates the ability of Bcl-2 to protect cells from apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation (10Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that Bcl-2 can be phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro by JNK (12Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Magnenat E. Camps M. Muda M. Chabert C. Gillieron C. Boschert U. Vial-Knecht E. Martinou J.-C. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25238-25242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutationally activated Rac1 induces Bcl-2 phosphorylation (12Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Magnenat E. Camps M. Muda M. Chabert C. Gillieron C. Boschert U. Vial-Knecht E. Martinou J.-C. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25238-25242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In our experiments, Bcl-2 protected cells from apoptosis induced by Gα12 and Gα13 (Figs. 7 and 8). Moreover, Gα subunits induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (Figs. 7 and 8). In conclusion, Gα12 and Gα13 can induce either mitogenesis and neoplastic transformation (18Xu N. Bradlet L. Ambdukar I. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6741-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,19Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2559-2565PubMed Google Scholar) or apoptosis (Ref. 21Althoefer H. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24380-24386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar; this paper), depending on the cell type. However, the mechanisms that allow these two G proteins to regulate such different events are not known. We now know several intracellular molecular steps that connect Gα12 and Gα13 with either mitogenesis or apoptosis (18Xu N. Bradlet L. Ambdukar I. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One possibility is that different composition of signaling components that can be regulated by Gα12 and Gα13 will determine the cellular response initiated by these G proteins.

Specifically, tetrahydrofolate (in bacteria and eukaryotic organisms) and tetrahydromethanopterin (in archaea) mediate the transfer of one-carbon fragments, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)1is implicated in the hydroxylation of aromatic amino acids and the formation of nitric oxide in animals (1Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. J.

The metabolic roles of these cofactors have been reviewed repeatedly (3Brown G.M. Williamson J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. 1.

The formation of pterins by ring expansion of guanosine, including an Amadori rearrangement of the ribose moiety, was first suggested by Weygand et al. (7Weygand F. Simon H. Dahms G. Waldschmidt M.

More specifically, C-8 of GTP (Fig. 1, compound 1) is released as formate, carbon atoms 1′ and 2′ of the ribose moiety are utilized for the formation of the dihydropyrazine ring, and carbon atoms 3′–5′ of GTP afford the position 6 side chain of dihydroneopterin triphosphate (NH2TP) (Fig. 1, compound 2) (for a review, see Ref. 3Brown G.M. Williamson J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 521-538Google Scholar). The product of GTP cyclohydrolase I, NH2TP, is converted to BH4 (compound 4) by the consecutive action of pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PPH4 synthase) and sepiapterin reductase (10Switchenko A.C.

Whereas the details of this complex reaction sequence are incompletely understood, it is immediately obvious that the reaction formally requires the removal of hydrogen from C-2′ of GTP followed by the reintroduction of hydrogen, which becomes ultimately located at C-7 of the product. The experiments reported in this paper were designed in order to determine the details of the hydrogen transfer process and the stereochemical course of the reaction. [U-13C6]Glucose (99% enrichment) and D2O (99.9% enrichment) were purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH) and EurisoTop (Gif-sur-Yvette, France), respectively. d-Neopterin, l-sepiapterin,l-biopterin, and (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin dihydrochloride were obtained from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Alkaline phosphatase and lysozyme were from Boehringer Mannheim. Other enzymes were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of the highest available purity. The reaction mixture contained 100 mmTris hydrochloride, pH 8.0, 300 mm KCl, 60 mmMgCl2, 55.5 mm[U-13C6]glucose, 1 mm DTT, 66 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, 5.5 mm ATP, 225 mm ammonium acetate, 225 mm ketoglutarate, 5.5 mm NADP+, 5 units of hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), 4.3 units of pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), 1.7 units of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.44), 5 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49), and 5 units ofl-glutamatic dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.3.11) in a total volume of 2 ml. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C and was monitored by 13C NMR spectroscopy at intervals. The reaction was terminated when the 13C signals of 6-phosphogluconate had disappeared. The solution was lyophilized, and the residue was dissolved in 2 ml of D2O. The compounds involved were characterized by the following 13C NMR parameters (ppm values; determined in H2O/D2O solution at pH 8.0 at 90.55 MHz).

The mixture was incubated at 37 °C. At intervals, aliquots of 100 mmguanine in 0.5 m NaOD (total volume, 740 μl) and of [U-13C5]ribulose 5-phosphate (see above) (total volume, 1200 μl) in D2O were added. Phosphoenolpyruvate was replenished, and the pH was adjusted by addition of concentrated HCl. The reaction was monitored by ion pair high pressure liquid chromatography using a column of Nucleosil RP18 (5 μm, Macherey & Nagel, Düren, Germany; 4 × 250 mm). The eluent contained 1% triethylammonium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 0.8% isopropanol (20Blau N. Niederwieser A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The effluent was monitored by a Hewlett-Packard HP1504A diode array detector. The reaction was terminated after 17 h. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 4.0 by the addition of concentrated HCl. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was placed on a column of DEAE-cellulose DE 52 (20 × 145 mm) that had been equilibrated with 30 mm LiCl, pH 3.5. The column was developed with a linear gradient of 30–195 mm LiCl at a temperature of 4 °C. The effluent was monitored photometrically at 280 nm. Fractions containing GTP were combined. The pH was adjusted to 6.5 by the addition of ammonium bicarbonate. The solution was lyophilized. The residue was extracted with dry methanol. The lithium salt of GTP was collected by centrifugation. The residue was dried under reduced pressure. The yield of GTP was 12.7 mg (23 μmol, 33% based on glucose) as estimated photometrically (ε252 nm1 cm = 13,700 m−1) (21Dawson R.C.M. Elliot D.C.

The open reading frame specifying human PPH4synthase was amplified by PCR using ATCC clone 79818 (22Thöny B. Leimbacher W. Buergisser D. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as a template. The oligonucleotides PPH4–1F (5′-GAGGAGAAATTAACTATGAGCACGGAAGGTGGTGGCCGTCG-3′) and PPH4S-2Pst (5′-ATTATTCTGCAGTGCTAACCCCAATAGCTATTCTCC-3′) were used as primers. The resulting DNA fragment was reamplified using the oligonucleotides UniEcoRI (5′-CAATTTGAATTCATTAAAGAGGAGAAATTAACTATG-3′) and PPH4–2Pst as primers. After restriction with EcoRI and PstI, the resulting PCR fragment was ligated into the vector pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany) yielding the plasmid pMAL-PPH4S, which specifies a fusion protein comprising the maltose-binding protein of E. coli and human PPH4 synthase. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain XL-1 blue, yielding the recombinant strain E. coli XL-1 blue pMAL-PPH4S. Plasmid pNCO-SR (17Auerbach G. Herrmann A. Gütlich M. Fischer M. Jacob U. Bacher A. Huber R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7219-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI and HindIII. The resulting 0.8-kilobase pair fragment was ligated into the vector pMAL-c2, which had been prepared with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid pMAL-SR specifies a fusion protein comprising maltose-binding protein of E. coli and murine sepiapterin reductase. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain XL-1 blue by electroporation yielding the recombinant strain E. coli XL-1 blue pMAL-SR. The recombinant E. coli strain M15 (pREP4, pECHI) (14Nar H. Huber R. Meining W. Schmid C. Weinkauf S. Bacher A. Structure. 1995; 3: 459-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was grown aerobically as described in LB medium containing 150 mg of ampicillin and 22 mg of kanamycin per liter. At anA 600 of 0.7, isopropylthiogalactoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 18 h of incubation. Wet cell mass (8 g) was suspended in 100 ml of a solution containing 20 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 14 mg of lysozyme. The suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 40 min and was then subjected to ultrasonic treatment and centrifuged. The supernatant was applied to a column of DEAE-cellulose (DE 52, Whatman, 40 × 160 mm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.5. The column was washed with 300 ml of 20 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.5, and was subsequently developed with a gradient of 0–0.25 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.5. Fractions were combined. Alkaline phosphatase (0.14 mg/ml) was added, and the solution was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in order to hydrolyze phosphorylated pteridines. The solution was loaded on a column of DEAE-cellulose (20 × 100 mm) that was developed as described above. Fractions were collected and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The protein showed a single band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specific activity was 96 nmol min−1 mg−1. Fractions were combined and concentrated. The concentration of GTP cyclohydrolase I was monitored photometrically using an absorbance coefficient of ε280 nm1 cm = 0.33 ml mg−1. The enzyme was stored at 4 °C in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmDTT. The recombinant fusion proteins consisting of maltose-binding protein and PPH4synthase or sepiapterin reductase were purified by the following procedure. The respective E. coli strains were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (170 mg per liter). At anA 600 of 0.6, isopropylthiogalactoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm. After 5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were homogenized by ultrasonic treatment in 50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.0. The suspension was centrifuged. The crude extract was applied to an amylose resin column (New England Biolabs; 20 × 30 mm). The column was washed with 50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.0, and was then developed with 50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm maltose. Assay mixtures for the determination of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity contained 100 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm GTP, and protein. The samples were incubated at 37 °C, and absorbance at 330 nm was recorded. The concentration of NH2TP was estimated using an absorption coefficient of ε330 nm1 cm = 6300m−1 (23Pfleiderer W. Blakely R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985: 43-114Google Scholar). Assay mixtures for the determination of PPH4 synthase contained 50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NADPH, an excess of sepiapterin reductase (2 mg per ml), and protein in a total volume of 300 μl. The solutions were incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 1 m hydrochloric acid containing 1% iodine and 2% potassium iodide. Biopterin was determined by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a column of Nucleosil 10-C18 (Macherey & Nagel; 4 × 250 mm). The eluent contained 3% methanol, 2% acetonitrile, 0.4% phosphoric acid, and water in a total volume of 1 liter. The flow rate was 1 ml min−1. The effluent was monitored fluorometrically (excitation, 350 nm; emission, 450 nm). The retention time of biopterin was 8 min (24Kerler F. Hueltner L. Ziegler I. Katzenmaier G. Bacher A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures for the determination of sepiapterin reductase activity contained 50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.0, 100 μm NADPH, 40 μm sepiapterin, and protein in a total volume of 300 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated as described above. Biopterin was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (see above). One unit of each of the enzymes under study catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of product/min at 37 °C. For experiments to be performed in D2O, all reaction components were lyophilized repeatedly and subsequently dissolved in 99.9% D2O. Enzyme reactions were performed as follows. The reaction mixtures were subjected to NMR analysis without further processing. The reaction mixture contained 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm GTP, and 70 units of GTP cyclohydrolase I in a volume of 500 μl. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 4 h in sealed vials under an atmosphere of nitrogen. To a solution of NH2TP prepared as described above, a solution (100 μl) containing 60 mm MgCl2, 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 27 units of PPH4 synthase (fusion protein) was added anaerobically by injection through the rubber septum. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. To a solution of NH2TP obtained as described above, a solution (100 μl) containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 60 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 31 mm NADPH, 76 mm 6-phosphogluconate, 125 milliunits of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, 36 units of sepiapterin reductase (fusion protein), and 27 units of PPH4 synthase (fusion protein) were added anaerobically by injection through the rubber septum. The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. NMR measurements were performed at 27 °C using a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer operating at 500.13 and 125.7 MHz for 1H and 13C NMR experiments, respectively. The spectrometer was equipped with a lock-switch unit for2H-decoupling experiments using the lock channel. D2O (100 μl) was added anaerobically to reaction mixtures containing H2O as solvent. The NMR tubes were flushed with argon for 10 min. The solution was injected into the NMR tube, and the tube was sealed with an Omni-Fit sample tube valve (Wilmad, Buena, NY). One-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR experiments and two-dimensional double-quantum-filtered COSY, NOESY, HMQC, and HMQC-TOCSY experiments were performed with standard Bruker software (XWINNMR). 13C NMR spectra were obtained using a dual13C/1H probehead, and proton-detection experiments were obtained using a1H/13C/15N inverse triple resonance probehead. Simultaneous 1H and 2H decoupling of13C was achieved with a WALTZ16 pulse sequence during relaxation (1H) and acquisition (1H,2H). 2H decoupling was via the lock channel using a lock-switch unit (Bruker). Prior to Fourier transformation, the free induction decay was multiplied with a Gaussian function. NMR spectra were simulated using the NMR-SIM software package from Bruker. Experiments were designed to study the transfer of deuterium in the enzyme reaction. At the outset of the experiments, we assumed tentatively that the putative Amadori rearrangement might proceed by reincorporation of a proton released from C-2′ into the enzyme product. Based on this working hypothesis (which turned out to be incorrect), we decided to conduct the experiments with GTP labeled with deuterium in the 2′ position. In order to increase the selectivity and sensitivity of 13C NMR observations, it also appeared advantageous to label the ribose side chain of substrate GTP with 13C. Consequently, [1′,2′,3′,4′,5′-13C5,2′-2H1]GTP (Fig. 2, compound 1a) was prepared from [U-13C6]glucose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Briefly, [U-13C6]glucose was converted to [U-13C5]ribulose 5-phosphate in a one-pot reaction using hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. NADPH generated by the reaction sequence was dehydrogenated using glutamate dehydrogenase, with α-ketoglutarate serving as hydride acceptor (25Richter G. Krieger C. Volk R. Kis K. Ritz H. Götze E. Bacher A. Methods. Enzymol. 1997; 280: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). [U-13C5]Ribulose phosphate was converted to GTP in a one-pot reaction performed in D2O as solvent. The reaction mixtures contained all enzymes required for generation of GTP. Pentose phosphate isomerase was added in a large excess (26Parkin D.W. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The phosphate donor was phosphoenolpyruvate. Under these experimental conditions, deuterium from solvent was incorporated into the 2′ position of the ribose moiety with an enrichment above 90%. The labeling pattern of the multiply labeled GTP sample was confirmed by multinuclear NMR experiments (Table I). The presence of 2H at the 2′ position was confirmed by the large upfield 13C shift of C-2′ and the smaller upfield shifts of C-1′ and C-3′.

Open table in a new tab An aqueous buffer of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, was used as solvent for NMR spectroscopy The labeled GTP was converted to NH2TP by the catalytic action of GTP cyclohydrolase I in H2O or D2O solution. In the experiment using H2O as solvent, the13C signal of C-7 of NH2TP appears as a doublet of doublets due to 13C13C coupling via one bond (to C-6) and via two bonds (to C-1′) (Fig. 3 A). This signal pattern was not affected by 2H decoupling. It follows that the enzyme product had the structure 2a (Fig. 2). In a similar experiment with D2O as solvent, the {1H}-decoupled 13C signal of C-7 appeared as a broad hump (Fig. 3 B). Simultaneous {1H,2H}-decoupling revealed a double doublet pattern for C-7 that differed from that in Fig. 3 Aby an upfield shift of 0.30 ppm. The signal of C-6 was also offset to high field by 0.06 ppm. The difference between the spectra obtained in the two experiments indicates that, contrary to our initial hypothesis, the reaction in water resulted in the virtually complete loss of the deuterium bound at C-2′ of the GTP substrate, whereas the product obtained in D2O as solvent contained deuterium in the position 7 methylene group of NH2TP. In summary, the structure of the enzyme product obtained in D2O is described by the structure 2b (Fig. 2). It follows that the formation of NH2TP (compound 2) involves the efficacious exchange of a proton released from C-2′ of substrate GTP with solvent water. For the analysis of the stereochemical course of the H addition step, it was therefore in order to conduct experiments in D2O, irrespective of the presence or absence of deuterium in the 2′ position of substrate GTP. The chemical shifts of the diastereotopic H-atoms at C-7 of NH2TP (compound 2) are degenerate, because the effect of the chirality in C-1′ and C-2′ does not extend far enough to cause any significant chiral induction at the C-7 methylene group (data not shown). In order to determine the configuration of the CHD group in position 7 of the pteridine obtained in D2O as solvent, it was therefore necessary to generate a more closely adjacent chiral center. This was achieved by enzymatic conversion of NH2TP to pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (PPH4, compound 3) or BH4 (compound 4). PPH4 was obtained from [1′,2′,3′,4′,5′-13C5, 2′-2H1]GTP in D2O as solvent by the consecutive action of GTP cyclohydrolase and PPH4synthase in D2O as solvent. 13C NMR signals of the product are shown in Fig. 4.

https://openalex.org/W1991958039,"The human ATP1AL1-encoded protein (an α subunit of the human non-gastric H,K-ATPase) has previously been shown to assemble with the gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit (gH,Kβ) to form a functionally active ionic pump in HEK 293 cells. This pump has been found to be sensitive to both SCH 28080 and ouabain. However, the86Rb+-influx mediated by the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ heterodimer in HEK 293 cells is at least 1 order of magnitude larger than the maximum ouabain-sensitive proton efflux detected in the same cells. In this study we find that the intracellular Na+ content in cells expressing ATP1AL1 and gH,Kβ is two times lower than that in control HEK 293 cells in response to incubation for 3 h in the presence of 1 μm ouabain. Moreover, analysis of net Na+efflux in HEK 293 expressing the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ heterodimer reveals the presence of Na+ extrusion activity that is not sensitive to 1 μm ouabain but can be inhibited by 1 mm of this drug. In contrast, ouabain-inhibitable Na+ efflux in control HEK 293 cells is similarly sensitive to either 1 μm or 1 mm ouabain. Finally,86Rb+ influx through the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ complex is comparable to the 1 mm ouabain-sensitive Na+ efflux in the same cells. The data presented here suggest that the enzyme formed by ATP1AL1 and the gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit in HEK 293 cells mediates primarily Na+,K+ rather than H+,K+ exchange.

The human ATP1AL1 gene encodes an α subunit of a non-gastric H,K-ATPase (1Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajerdran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar). The non-gastric H,K-ATPases form a distinctive subset within a larger family of P-type potassium-dependent ion-transporting ATPases (ion pumps) that drive the import of K+ ions in exchange for Na+ ions (Na,K-ATPase) or for protons (H,K-ATPase) (2Doucet A.

Physiol. 1995; 269: F1-F16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these pumps are heterodimers, composed of a large polytopic α subunit (∼110 kDa) predicted to span the membrane 10 times and a heavily glycosylated β subunit (core protein is ∼35 kDa) that crosses the bilayer once in a type II orientation. The cDNAs encoding three non-gastric H,K-ATPase α subunits have been isolated and characterized. These include the colonic H,K-ATPase from rat (5Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These proteins manifest ∼75–85% identity to one another, and each of them is equally distant from both the Na,K- and H,K-ATPase α-polypeptides (∼65% identity). A cDNA encoding a β subunit polypeptide has also been isolated from a library prepared from toad bladder (9Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Pflueger Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 425: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This protein is ∼35% identical to the Na,K-ATPase and the gastric H,K-ATPase β-polypeptides. Although no additional non-gastric H,K-ATPase β subunits have yet been isolated from any mammalian species, it has been clearly demonstrated that the Na,K-ATPase and the gastric H,K-ATPase β-subunits (gH,Kβ)1 can assemble with the non-gastric H,K-ATPase α-polypeptides either when these proteins are co-expressed in heterologous expression systems (1Grishin A.V.

The pump-expressing oocytes could acidify the extracellular milieu in an extracellular K+-dependent fashion. Moreover, this acidification could be inhibited by both ouabain and SCH 28080 in a manner similar to that found in 86Rb+-uptake experiments (7Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. Rossier B.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Modyanov N.N. Mathews P.M. Grishin A.V. Beguin P. Beggah A.T. Rossier B.C. Horisberg J.-D. Geering K. Am. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7277-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, measurements quantitating these proton effluxes were not possible in the oocyte studies. We have previously demonstrated that HEK 293 cells expressing both the ATP1AL1-encoded protein and the gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit exhibit86Rb+ uptake activity which is different from that mediated by the endogenous Na,K-ATPase and which is sensitive to both SCH 28080 and to ouabain (K i values ∼131 and 42 μm, respectively) (1Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajerdran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these cells exhibit acid extrusion activity (during recovery of intracellular pH after acid loading through an NH4+ pulse) that is independent of extracellular sodium and that can be significantly inhibited by 1 mm ouabain. Comparison of the Rb+ and proton fluxes we measure demonstrates that Rb+ influx mediated by this pump is 10 times larger than the proton efflux catalyzed by the same enzyme. Moreover, while the acid extrusion activity mediated by the pump shows a marked pH dependence, the 86Rb+ uptake activity present in the cells expressing the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ complex is not stimulated by the acute lowering of intracellular pH. These data suggest, therefore, that the enzyme formed by the ATP1AL1-encoded protein and the gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit might exchange potassium for another cation. Our recent results provide further support for the concept that ATP1AL1 is not an H,K-ATPase but rather acts as an Na,K-ATPase. In our previous study we found that coexpression of ATP1AL1 and gH,Kβ in HEK 293 cells conferred upon these cells an ability to grow in the presence of 1 μm ouabain. None of the untransfected cells, nor cells singly transfected with only one of the pump subunit cDNAs, could grow in the presence of ouabain. More detailed analysis reveals that the intracellular Na+ content in the cells expressing ATP1AL1 and gH,Kβ is two times lower than that in control HEK 293 cells after incubation for 3 h in medium containing 1 μm ouabain. In contrast, there is no difference between transfected and control cells in media with no or with 1 mmouabain. Further study indicates that a Na+ extrusion activity sensitive to 1 mm but not to 1 μmouabain is present only in HEK 293 cells expressing the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ heterodimer. Moreover, 86Rb+ influx mediated by the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ complex measured under these conditions is comparable to the 1 mm ouabain-sensitive Na+efflux in the same cells. These observations suggest that the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ enzyme expressed in HEK 293 cells mediates primarily Na+,K+ rather than H+,K+ exchange. All plasmid constructions and stably transfected lines of HEK 293 cells have been previously obtained and characterized (1Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajerdran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar). Cell culture procedures were performed as before (1Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajerdran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar). Ouabain dependence of the cell growth was tested as described (15Price E.M. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) with modifications. The cells were seeded on a 24-well plate (5·104 cells per well, to allow the cells to reach almost 100% confluency in 4 days under normal conditions). On the following day, cell media were replaced with the same media containing different concentrations of ouabain (two wells were analyzed for each concentration of ouabain). After an additional 3 days of growth in the presence or absence of ouabain, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) at room temperature and lysed with 1% CHAPS at 4 °C for at least 1 h. The cell protein content was determined using BCA Protein Assay (Pierce) (16Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermason G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18347) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured onto a 6-well plate and grown to ∼80–90% confluency (2–3 days). They were treated with 10 mm sodium butyrate in the media for 16–24 h prior to the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the media were replaced with the same containing 0, 1 μm, or 1 mm ouabain (two wells for each concentration of ouabain) plus or minus 1 mm amiloride or 200 μm bumetanide, and cells were incubated for an additional 3 h in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere (10 mm of sodium butyrate was present throughout the experiment as well). After this period, cells were washed three times with ice-cold Na+-free isotonic solution containing 160 mm N-methyl-d-glucammonium (NMDG) chloride, pH 7.4, and lysed in 2 ml of 1% CHAPS solution as above. Concentrations of sodium and potassium in the cell lysate were measured by means of flame photometry on a 400 Flame Photometer (Corning, New York). The cell lysate protein concentration was determined as in the previous paragraph. Finally, the intracellular sodium and potassium content was expressed as nanomoles per μg of total cell protein. Experiments were performed on the cells prepared in the same manner as for the steady state experiments above. On the day of the experiment, cells were preloaded with sodium by washing three times (5 ml per well) with potassium-free solution (“STD/OK” solution, 145 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 32 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C) plus or minus ouabain, and incubated in the last wash for 1 h at the same temperature (all of the following steps were performed at 37 °C as well). One-hour incubation of these cells in STD/OK solution is enough for the intracellular sodium concentration to reach a plateau at ∼100 mm. 2R. Zahler, personal communication. After the sodium load period, Na+ efflux was initiated by replacing STD/OK solution with 2 ml per well of STD/ONa buffer (which is STD/OK buffer containing 5 mm KCl and with NaCl substituted by an equimolar concentration of NMDGCl). After incubation for different times, sodium efflux was terminated by rinsing cells twice with ice-cold isotonic NMDGCl solution. Cells were lysed in 1% CHAPS, and intracellular sodium content was determined as described above. 86Rb+ uptake was performed as described previously (1Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajerdran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar) except that the cells were preloaded with Na+ by incubating in STD/OK solution at 37 °C with or without ouabain for 1 h. 86Rb+ uptake was initiated by switching the incubation solution from STD/OK to STD/ONa (with 5 mm RbCl instead of KCl). The uptake was terminated after incubation at 10 min at 37 °C by washing 6 times with the ice-cold isotonic NMDGCl solution. Cells were lysed in 2% CHAPS as above and analyzed (1Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajerdran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar). Unless noted, data are reported as the mean ± S.E. We used the unpaired Student t test to assess levels of significance. A p value less than 0.05 is considered significant. The Na+ efflux data were fitted by the Igor graphics and data analysis program (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), which exploits the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (17Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar). The intracellular sodium content at different time points ([Na+i]t) is presented as a fraction of the 0 time point ([Na+i]0) and plotted versus time. Each time course was fitted to a single exponential as ([Na+i]t/ [Na+i]0) = A + B · exp(−kNa ·t), where values of A, B, and kNa are obtained from the fitting and correspond to ([Na+i]∞/[Na+i]0), ([Na+i]t − [Na+i]∞/[Na+i]0), and a rate constant (min−1), respectively ([Na+i]∞− is the intracellular sodium content at time infinity). In our previous studies (1Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajerdran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar), we found that the ouabain-sensitive86Rb+ influx mediated by the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ heterodimer in HEK 293 cells was 10 times larger than the ouabain-sensitive proton efflux in the same cells (∼0.1 mmol H+·l−1·min−1 versus ∼(0.8–1.6) mmol Rb+·l−1·min−1). In addition, whereas the acid extrusion activity was pHi-dependent with the maximum at pHi∼6.3, the 86Rb+ uptake activity appeared not be affected by acute lowering of intracellular pH (1Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajerdran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ complex mediates the exchange of potassium primarily for a cation other than protons. We speculated that Na+ serves as the counter ion for the transport catalyzed by ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ. This possibility is consistent with our finding that this pump can substitute for the Na+,K+-dependent ATPase in maintaining intracellular ionic homeostasis. Stably transfected HEK 293 cell lines expressing both ATP1AL1 and the gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit can grow in media containing 1 μm ouabain, whereas wild type HEK 293 cells, HEK 293 cells transfected with empty expression vector, or cells expressing only one of the subunit proteins are highly sensitive to this concentration (1Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajerdran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar). A more detailed characterization of this difference in ouabain resistance has been obtained from measurements of ouabain-inhibitable cell growth, which are presented in Fig. 1. Wild type HEK 293 cells, HEK 293 transfected with the expression vector alone (HEK NEO) and clone 50 (expressing ATP1AL1 alone) demonstrate growth inhibition by ouabain which exhibits a single low K iof about 200 nm, reflecting the high affinity for ouabain of the endogenous Na,K-ATPase (1Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajerdran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, three cell lines expressing the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ heterodimer (cell lines 119, 152, 114) clearly exhibit a second inhibition constant of about 50 μm, which is in good agreement with the ouabain sensitivity of the 86Rb+ uptake mediated by the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ complex (K i ∼ 42 μm(1Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajerdran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar)). It should be noted that the isolation of ouabain-resistant cells expressing both ATP1AL1 and gH,Kβ is a common event. Four lines of transfected HEK 293 cells expressing both subunits were initially isolated and selected by means of immunofluorescence analysis. Three of these cell lines demonstrate a substantial cell growth at concentrations of ouabain equal to or higher than 1 μm(Fig. 1). In addition, a small fraction of the cells (∼7%) from the fourth cell line (data not shown) expressing the active pump complex can also survive at concentrations of ouabain greater than 1 μm. To elucidate further the mechanism underlying the ouabain resistance in 119 cells, we studied the effect of the selective inhibition of the endogenous Na,K-ATPase and the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ enzyme by 1 μm and 1 mm ouabain, respectively, on the steady state levels of intracellular sodium (Nai) and potassium (Ki) contents (determined by means of flame photometry, see “Experimental Procedures”). As can be seen in Fig. 2 A, the presence of either 1 μm or 1 mm ouabain is sufficient to maximally inhibit the endogenous Na,K-ATPase in HEK 293 cells and both produce a ∼6.7-fold increase in Nai in these cells. In 119 cells, a similar ∼5.5-fold elevation in Nai is obtained with 1 mm ouabain, whereas incubation with 1 μmouabain leads to only a ∼3.0-fold increase. Intracellular potassium content changes in the opposite manner under the same conditions (Fig. 2 B). Neither bumetanide (200 μm) nor amiloride (1 mm) appears to alter the intracellular sodium or potassium contents in response to the different ouabain concentrations in the media. This observation rules out any involvement of either the Na+, K+, Cl− cotransporter or the Na+/H+ exchanger in maintenance of low Nai in 119 cells. Since the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ complex is fully inhibited by 1 mm ouabain and only partially blocked by a 1 μm concentration of the drug, these data suggest that Na+ extrusion directly catalyzed by this pump could account for the observed differences in the intracellular sodium content. We also measured sodium efflux in 119 and HEK 293 cells directly by determining the Nai recovery time course following a sodium load (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Data from one representative experiment (taken from three independent trials) performed on each cell type are depicted in Fig. 3 (A and B). The data are presented as a time course of changes in the ratio [Na+i]t/[Na+i]0(where [Na+i]t and [Na+i]0 represent the intracellular sodium contents at different time points and at the 0 time point, respectively). As can be seen in Fig. 3 A, the rate of the sodium efflux in 119 cells is differentially sensitive to the presence of 1 μm or 1 mm ouabain. In contrast, 1 μm ouabain inhibits Nai recovery rate to the same extent as 1 mm ouabain in untransfected HEK 293 cells (Fig. 3 B). The same conclusion can be drawn from a comparison of the rate constants for Na+ efflux (k Na) obtained from the fitting procedure (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table I). Thus, in 119 cellsk Na in the presence of 1 mm ouabain is ∼1.86 lower than that in the presence of 1 μm of the drug (0.1738 ± 0.0129 min−1 versus0.3239 ± 0.0479 min−1, p < 0.02), which in turn is significantly lower (in ∼1.5 times) than the rate constant in the absence of ouabain (0.3239 ± 0.0479 min−1 versus 0.486 ± 0.0386 min−1, p < 0.05). On the other hand, in HEK 293 cells, k Na in the presence of either 1 μm or 1 mm ouabain is ∼4.2 times less than that in the absence of the drug (Table I, p < 0.005), and there is no statistically significant difference between effect of these two different concentrations of ouabain on the rate constant (Table I, p > 0.4). Therefore, there is a sodium extruding activity in 119 cells that is absent in the control HEK 293 cells and that demonstrates sensitivity to ouabain similar to that of the 86Rb+ uptake activity mediated by the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ heterodimer in the same cells. Finally, we measured the86Rb+ uptake mediated by the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ heterodimer in 119 cells under the sodium pre-loading conditions employed in the Na+ efflux experiment. We find that these two activities are of comparable magnitude, ∼(0.099 ± 0.046) nmol of Na+·μg of cell protein−1·10 min−1 versus ∼(0.195 ± 0.024) nmol Rb+·μg of cell protein−1·10 min−1, for the Na+ efflux and86Rb+ uptake, respectively (Table II). As we noted above, we have previously shown that the rate of proton extrusion is at most 1/10 of the Rb+ uptake driven by ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ expressed in transfected HEK 293 cells (9Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Pflueger Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 425: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, while it is clear that ATP1AL1 can mediate the efflux of protons in exchange for K+, our data demonstrate that Na+,K+ exchange is the predominant transport catalyzed by this pump.Table IRate constants of the Na-efflux time course in 119 and HEK 293 cellsOuabainRate constant,k Na+, min−1119 (ATP1AL1+gH,Kβ)HEK 293None0.4860 ± 0.03860.5793 ± 0.07821 μm0.3239 ± 0.04790.1364 ± 0.04121 mm0.1738 ± 0.02190.1377 ± 0.0216Rate constants (k Na+, min−1) at three different concentrations of ouabain (0, 1 μm, and 1 mm) were obtained from fitting of the data depicted in Fig. 3 to single exponentials as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.

Each value represents mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. We have presented data which suggest that the pump formed by ATP1AL1 and the gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit complex in stably transfected HEK 293 cells is active as an (Na+,H+),K+-transporting membrane ATPase. It should not be surprising, therefore, that expression of this pump confers upon HEK 293 cells resistance to ouabain at concentrations that completely inhibit the growth of the cells expressing only the highly ouabain-sensitive endogenous Na,K-ATPase. The conclusion that ATP1AL1 functions predominantly as an Na,K-ATPase under physiological conditions would also explain the 1 order of magnitude difference between the 86Rb+ uptake mediated by the complex and the proton efflux through the same pump. Similarly, the observation that ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ-catalyzed86Rb+ uptake appears to be insensitive to decreases in intracellular pH whereas the proton extruding activity demonstrates a marked stimulation by lowering pHi (1Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajerdran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with the model. Recently, Cougnon et al. (18Cougnon M. Bouyer P. Planelles G. Jaisser F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. .A. 1998; 95: 6516-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have found that the steady state level of intracellular Na+ is approximately two times lower in Xenopus oocytes expressing a combination of the colonic H,K-ATPase α subunit with the gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit than in oocytes expressing gH,Kβ alone or the gastric H,K-ATPase α and β subunits together. A similar change is noted in oocytes co-expressing the toad Na,K-ATPase α and β subunits. The decrease in intracellular Na+ in Xenopus oocytes expressing colonic H,K-ATPase was also observed when diffusive Na+ influx was elevated by expression of the functional amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel. This effect is dependent on the presence of potassium in the extracellular milieu and could be inhibited by 2 mm ouabain, a concentration known to inhibit the colonic H,K-ATPase (11Cougnon M.

This observation suggests that the colonic H,K-ATPase is also likely to be capable of active outward Na+ transport and lends additional support for our interpretation of the data presented here. Further experiments need to be performed to characterize in detail the (Na+,H+),K+ exchange mediated by the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ pump. Whereas the data presented in this paper demonstrate that the pump-catalyzed Rb+ and Na+fluxes are of similar magnitudes, it will be important to measure the cation stoichiometry directly and to determine its dependence upon intracellular pH. It will also be necessary to measure the ATPase activity of the pump and actual affinity for sodium. We have attempted to measure the ATPase activity of ATP1AL1 expressed in HEK 293 cells. Unfortunately, we have not yet succeeded in detecting K+-dependent ATPase activity in 119 cells that is insensitive to 1 μm ouabain but is inhibited by 1 mm concentration of this drug. Presumably the membrane isolation or permeabilization conditions applied to date have not maintained ATP1AL1 function. Future experiments will involve further efforts to identify assay conditions in which ATP1AL1-driven ATP hydrolysis can be quantitated. The physiological relevance of the Na+,K+exchange mediated by the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ pump and by the colonic H,K-ATPase is not clear at present. Several laboratories have reported that sodium is involved in regulating the activity of pump-driven K+ absorption in the renal distal tubule and colon. Thus, earlier studies demonstrated that an Na,K-ATPase-like activity that appeared not to be aldosterone-regulated is present in the medullary collecting ducts of rats fed a low potassium diet (19Hayshi M. Katz A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: F437-F446PubMed Google Scholar, 20Eiam-Ong S. Kutzman N.A. Sabatini S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2385-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or from rats with furosemide-induced potassium wasting (21Eiam-Ong S. Kutzman N.A. Sabatini S. Kidney Int. 1993; 43: 1015-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This activity was proposed to be located in the apical membrane of medullary collecting duct cells (19Hayshi M. Katz A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: F437-F446PubMed Google Scholar, 20Eiam-Ong S. Kutzman N.A. Sabatini S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2385-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Other investigators have found that Na+ not only reduces K+ absorption through electroneutral, SCH 28080-sensitive H,K-ATPase in the perfused cortical collecting duct of K+-depleted rabbits (22Zhou X. Wingo C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F43-F48PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zhou X. Wingo C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F1134-F1141PubMed Google Scholar) but can apparently be transported from the lumen to bath by the same pump when the lumen K+ concentration was low (23Zhou X. Wingo C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F1134-F1141PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, elegant biochemical experiments have revealed that there are at least three distinguishable K-ATPase activities distinct from that of Na,K-ATPase present at several sites along the rat nephron (24Buffin-Meyer B. Younes-Ibrahim M. Barlet-Bas C. Cheval L. Marsy S. Doucet A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F124-F131PubMed Google Scholar). One of these, referred to as the type III K-ATPase activity, can be equally stimulated by either Na+ or K+. Potassium depletion appears to boost levels of expression of this ATPase activity. K+ depletion also leads to an increase in the expression of the colonic H,K-ATPase α subunit both at the mRNA and protein levels in the cortical and/or outer medullary collecting ducts (25Jaisser F. Escoubet B. Courtois-Coutry N. Eugene E. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C679-C687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sangan P. Rajerdran V.M. Mann S.M. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am.

Physiol. 1996; 432: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, if colonic H,K-ATPase and/or ATP1AL1 could possibly account for type III ATPase activity, since the pharmacological profile of the colonic H,K-ATPase and ATP1AL1 determined in expression studies is dramatically different from that of the type III ATPase. Although the type III ATPase is sensitive to ouabain with K i of ∼20 μm and to SCH 28080 with K i of ∼1 μm (24Buffin-Meyer B. Younes-Ibrahim M. Barlet-Bas C. Cheval L. Marsy S. Doucet A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F124-F131PubMed Google Scholar), ATP1AL1 is inhibited by ouabain and SCH 28080 with K i values of ∼40 and ∼130 μm (1Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajerdran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, and the colonic H,K-ATPase exhibits a K i for ouabain of ∼(0.5–1) mm and no susceptibility to SCH 28080 (11Cougnon M. Planelles G.

Measurements of ATP1AL1-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis will be required to determine whether Na+ can substitute for K+ as it does in the renal type III ATPase activity. The vanadate-sensitive potassium absorption in the rat distal colon appears to include both Na+-sensitive, ouabain-insensitive as well as Na+-insensitive, ouabain-sensitive, components (30Pandiyan V. Rajendran V.M. Binder H.J. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 1846-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Since both the expression of the colonic H,K-ATPase (25Jaisser F. Escoubet B. Courtois-Coutry N. Eugene E. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C679-C687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sangan P. Rajerdran V.M. Mann S.M. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the activity of the sodium-sensitive component of the vanadate-sensitive K+ absorption activity (30Pandiyan V. Rajendran V.M. Binder H.J. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 1846-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are elevated in the sodium-restricted rats, it has been proposed that the colonic H,K-ATPase is responsible for the Na+-sensitive ouabain-insensitive component of colonic K+ restriction (26Sangan P. Rajerdran V.M. Mann S.M. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two types of acid extruding activity, Na+-dependent and Na+-independent, have also been detected at the lumen side of the rat colon (31Ferrone R.D. McBride D. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: G898-G906PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these activities can be significantly inhibited by either ouabain or orthovanadate, but only the Na+-independent component is dependent on the presence of mucosal K+. Sodium depletion has been shown to stimulate the Na+-independent fraction of this acid extruding activity in the rat colon without affecting the Na+-dependent component. The K-ATPase activities detected in the colon, however, do not exhibit a dependence on the presence of Na+ (32Del Castillo Rajendran V.M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G1005-G1011PubMed Google Scholar, 33Watanabe T. Suzuki T. Suzuki Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: G506-G511PubMed Google Scholar, 34Tabuchi Y. Takeguchi M. Asano S. Takeguchi N. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, whether a simple concordance can be drawn to relate the (Na+,H+),K+ exchange mediated by the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ pump and colonic H,K-ATPase to this complex pattern of activities involved in K+ absorption in the nephron and in the colon remains to be seen. Both the Na,K-ATPase and the gastric H,K-ATPase can exhibit mixed ion specificities in certain circumstances but not under normal physiological conditions (35Polvani C. Sachs G. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17854-17859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Polvani C. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16757-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Rabon E.C.

Comparison of the sequences of the Na,K- and gastric H,K-ATPase fourth transmembrane segments (TM4) reveals that they differ at 7 of 28 positions. It is interesting to note that mutagenesis studies performed on the Na,K-ATPase α subunit demonstrate that Asn-331, 3The amino acid numbering is indicated according to the deduced amino acid sequence of the rat Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit (38Shull G.E.

Chem. 1986; 261: 16788-16791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). in the fourth putative transmembrane domain, plays a critical role in determining the sodium affinity of the pump (40Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recent chimera studies in our laboratory 4M. Mense, L. Dunbar, and M. Caplan, unpublished observations.indicate that the TM4 residues play an important role in establishing distinct cation selectivities of these pumps. Substitution of the Na,K-ATPase fourth transmembrane domain residues with their gastric H,K-ATPase counterparts (Leu-324, Asn-331, Thr-345, Phe-333, Tyr-340, and Ser-354, respectively) produces an (H,Na),K-ATPase activity that may preferentially function as an H,K-ATPase at low pH. It is interesting to note that the sequences of the ATP1AL1 and colonic H,K-ATPase TM4s differ from that of the Na,K-ATPase by only one residue. In the positions of the residues that appear to be important for proton transport in the gastric H+,K+ pump, ATP1AL1 and the colonic H,K-ATPase possess the same residues found in the comparable positions of the sodium pump. The conservation of Na,K-ATPase sequence in the TM4s of ATP1AL1 and the colonic H,K-ATPase may account, at least in part, for the Na,K-ATPase-like behavior of these pumps. Mutagenesis and chimera experiments employing ATP1AL1, the gastric H,K-ATPase, and the Na,K-ATPase are under way to define further the structural basis for the cation transport properties of these pumps. In conclusion, the data presented here demonstrate that the ATP1AL1 co-expressed with the gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit in HEK 293 cells functions to mediate predominantly Na+,K+exchange. The kinetic properties of the (Na+,H+),K+ exchange driven by the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ pump as well as it's physiologic role in the maintenance of ionic homeostasis remain to be elucidated.

We also wish to thank Dr. Bliss Forbush III for valuable comments and insightful suggestions as well as the entire Caplan lab for helpful discussions.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2543-2552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have reported that HEK 293 cells expressing a truncated but functionally active form of the rat colonic H,K-ATPase α-subunit and the gastric H,K-ATPase β-subunit can grow in media containing 1 μm ouabain, consistent with the data presented in this study for the ATP1AL1-gH,Kβ pump. This observation suggests that the enzyme composed of the colonic H,K-ATPase α-subunit and gH,Kβ can substitute for the endogenous Na,K-ATPase in maintaining intracellular ionic balance, lending additional support to the interpretation presented in this paper and by Cougnon et al.

https://openalex.org/W2074088249,"Ste20p from Saccharomyces cerevisiaeis a member of the Ste20/p21-activated protein kinase family of protein kinases. The Ste20p kinase is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation in a cell cycle-dependent manner, as judged by the appearance of phosphatase-sensitive species with reduced mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This modification is maximal during S phase, and correlates with the accumulation of Ste20p fused to green fluorescent protein at the site of bud emergence. Overexpression of Cln2p, but not Clb2p or Clb5p, causes a quantitative shift of Ste20p to the reduced mobility form, and this shift is dependent on Cdc28p activity. The post-translational mobility shift can be generated in vitro by incubation of Ste20p with immunoprecipitated Cln2p kinase complexes, but not by immunoprecipitated Clb2p or Clb5p kinase complexes. Ste20p is therefore a substrate for the Cdc28p kinase, and undergoes a Cln2p-Cdc28p mediated mobility shift as cells initiate budding and DNA replication. In cells that express only the Cln2p G1 cyclin, minor overexpression of Ste20p causes aberrant morphology, suggesting a proper coordination of Ste20p and Cln-Cdc28p activity may be required for the control of cell shape.

The Ste20p protein kinase, the founding member of the Ste20/PAK1 family of protein kinases, plays important roles in a number of cellular processes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Ste20p was initially identified because of its role in yeast mating (2Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) Subsequently, the Ste20p kinase was found to be required for pseudohyphal growth in diploid S. cerevisiae cells (3Liu H. Styles C. Fink G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and to be needed for invasive growth in nutrient limited haploid cells (4Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In addition, the kinase has a yet poorly defined essential function it shares with the related kinase Cla4p; although cells deleted for eitherSTE20 or CLA4 are viable, the double mutants are inviable (5Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). One of the potential areas of overlap between the Ste20p and Cla4p kinases is in the regulation of myosin-I function; both kinases can phosphorylate and activate the myosin-I isoform encoded byMYO3 (6Wu C. Lytvyn V. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30623-30626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). MYO3 itself has an overlapping essential function with the related myosin-I MYO5 (7Goodson H.V. Anderson B.L. Warrick H.M. Pon L.A. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1277-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because of the multiple roles of the Ste20 kinase, it is important that regulatory mechanisms exist to target the kinase activity to specific substrates. Overexpression of an N-terminally deleted kinase lacking regulatory domains is lethal (8Ramer S.W. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). One potential targeting mechanism is cellular localization; the Ste20 protein visualized by green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging is localized to the regions of polarized growth (9Leberer E. Wu C. Leeuw T. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Peter M. Neiman A.M. Park H.O. van Lohuizen M. Herskowitz I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7046-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this localization is underscored by the observation that mutations which perturb the localization, but not other aspects of Ste20 function, cause inviability in cla4-defective cells (9Leberer E. Wu C. Leeuw T. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Peter M. Neiman A.M. Park H.O. van Lohuizen M. Herskowitz I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7046-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This localization of Ste20p appears to depend on association with Cdc42p, as deletion of the Cdc42p binding domain of Ste20p is lethal in combination with Cla4p inactivation (9Leberer E. Wu C. Leeuw T. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Peter M. Neiman A.M. Park H.O. van Lohuizen M. Herskowitz I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7046-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Differential associations of Ste20p with other proteins may also influence its function. The Ste5 protein, which serves as a specificity determinant for components of the pheromone response pathway, associates with Ste20 protein (11Leeuw T. Fourest A. Wu C. Chenevert J. Clark K. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Science. 1995; 270: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and so does the Bem1 protein (11Leeuw T. Fourest A. Wu C. Chenevert J. Clark K. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Science. 1995; 270: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The Ste4 protein, which encodes the β-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein, interacts with Ste20p in a mating pheromonedependent manner (12Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Ultimately, processes that localize or activate Ste20p in a cell cycle-dependent manner must be controlled, directly or indirectly, by the cell cycle regulatory machinery. The central regulator of the yeast cell cycle engine consists of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) encoded by theCDC28 gene, and a series of cyclin molecules: the three G1 cyclins encoded by CLN1, CLN2, and CLN3 and six mitotic cyclins encoded by CLB1, CLB2, CLB3, CLB4, CLB5, and CLB6. Through physical association, these cyclins are required for the activation of Cdc28p at different stages of the cell cycle (see Refs. 13Nasmyth K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar and 14Cross F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar for reviews). These cyclins themselves are somewhat specialized; current evidence suggests that CLN3 is important in transcriptional activation of SBF (Swi4p-Swi6p)- and MBF (Mbp1p-Swi6p)-dependent gene expression at Start (13Nasmyth K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 15Stuart D. Wittenberg C.

Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4803-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), while CLN1 and CLN2 are required for bud emergence (18Lew D.J. Marini N.J. Reed S.I. Cell. 1992; 69: 317-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Lew D.J. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20Schwob E. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1160-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Within theCLB family of cyclins, CLB5 and CLB6play a role in DNA replication (20Schwob E. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1160-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 21Epstein C.B. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), CLB3 and CLB4 in the formation of mitotic spindles (22Fitch I. Dahmann C. Surana U. Amon A. Nasmyth K. Goetsch L. Byers B.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2021-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and CLB1 and CLB2 in isometric bud growth and nuclear division (24Lew D.J. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 25Surana U. Robitsch H. Price C. Schuster T. Fitch I. Futcher A.B. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 65: 145-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The yeast pheromone response is tightly integrated with cell cycle regulation. Treatment of responsive cells with mating pheromones ultimately causes cell cycle arrest at Start (1Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 26Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 27Schultz J. Ferguson B. Sprague Jr., G.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This arrest requires Far1p, a G1 CDK inhibitor (28Chang F. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1990; 63: 999-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 29Peter M. Gartner A. Horecka J. Ammerer G. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1993; 73: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), whose expression and stability are normally under control of the cell cycle machinery. Far1p is abundant throughout mitosis and G1, and undetectable from S until the next M phase (30McKinney J.D. Chang F. Heintz N. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The activation of the pheromone pathway leads to increased expression and stability of Far1p (30McKinney J.D. Chang F. Heintz N. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Henchoz S. Chi Y. Catarin B. Herskowitz I. Deshaies R.J. Peter M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3046-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition, the basal activities (in the absence of mating pheromone) of other components such as Fus3 and Ste7 fluctuate in a cell cycle-regulated manner with a regulation profile similar to that of Far1p (32Wassmann K. Ammerer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13180-13188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cell cycle machinery also plays a role in pheromone responsiveness. Only cells that are in the M/G1 phase of the cell cycle are responsive to pheromone, whereas overexpression of the G1 cyclin CLN2, or of CLN1 with the combination of a far1 deletion, creates a nonresponsive phenotype (14Cross F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 33Oehlen L.J. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism for this remains unclear, the repressing effect by G1 cyclins on the regulation of mating pheromone signal transduction has been placed at a level that is upstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, and downstream of the mating pheromone receptor and the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein (14Cross F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Wassmann K. Ammerer G. J. Biol.

Here we show that Ste20p is post-translationally modified in a cell cycle-regulated manner, and this modification requires Cdc28p and Cln2p. Furthermore, Ste20p is an in vitro substrate of Cdc28p-Cln2p kinase complex.

Yeast transformations with circular or linearized plasmid DNA were carried out after treatment of yeast cells with lithium acetate (36Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P.

Plasmids pVTU-STE20, pVTU-STE20K649R, and pVTU-STE20K649A, which contain a wild-type Ste20p or catalytically inactive versions of Ste20p created by changing lysine at position 649 to either arginine or alanine, respectively, were constructed as described (34Wu C. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCWGEX-1 expressing a GST fusion of the catalytically inactive version of Ste20p, Ste20pK649R, was constructed as follows: The mutant version of ste20 was first amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (37Saiki R.J.

The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withBglII-XhoI, and then cloned intoBamHI-XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-3. Plasmids with HA epitope-tagged version of CLN2, CLB5, and CLB2 under the control of GAL1 promoter were kindly provided by Dr. M. Tyers of University Toronto. The integrating plasmid withGAL1::CLN2::LEU2 was kindly provided by Drs. L. J. Oehlen and F. R. Cross of Rockefeller University. Plasmid pRL116, carrying the GFP::STE20 under the control of the STE20 promoter, was described previously (9Leberer E. Wu C. Leeuw T. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To synchronize cells with temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles, cells grown to early log phase at room temperature were filtered out using a sterile filtration apparatus (Nalgene) and resuspended into pre-warmed (37 °C) media and then incubated at restrictive temperature (37 °C) for 2.5 h. The synchronized cells were examined by microscopy and released from restrictive to permissive temperature by being filtered out and resuspended into medium at the permissive temperature. The cells were then incubated at permissive temperature; samples were taken at indicated time intervals and immediately mixed with approximately equal volume of crushed ice to quickly cool the sample to approximately 0–4 °C. Cells were then collected by centrifugation and washed once with ice-cold sterile water, and the cell pellets were then quickly frozen and stored at –80 °C until preparation of total cell extracts. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain UT5600 (New England Biolabs), bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and eluted with glutathione as described previously (34Wu C. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The eluted proteins were then concentrated by centrifigation using the Centricon (Amicon Inc.) and stored at −80 °C. Total cell extract was prepared essentially as described previously (34Wu C. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation at an OD600 of 0.5–1.0 unless otherwise indicated, and resuspended at a concentration approximately 5 × 108cells/ml in lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100 (unless otherwise indicated), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml antipain. Cells were then disrupted using a bead beater (Bio-spec products) for 3 min at 4 °C. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and total protein concentration was determined by the Bradford reaction using the Bio-Rad protein determination kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The supernatant fractions were supplemented with 10% glycerol and stored at –80 °C. For Ste20p immunoprecipitation, aliquots of cell extracts containing approximately 1 mg of total cellular protein were incubated with 3 μl of anti-Ste20p antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 0.5–1 ml of lysis buffer supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The antibody-antigen complexes were then incubated with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads in lysis buffer (50% v/v) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing four times in lysis buffer and then twice in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20 mmmagnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmsodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), or washing twice with protein phosphatase 2A buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm manganese chloride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), the kinase reactions were then started by addition of 30 μl of prewarmed (30 °C) kinase buffer supplemented with 5 μm ATP and 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (4,500 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml). The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with indicated protein as substrate, and then boiled for 5 min after the addition of 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Aliquots (10–30 μl) of the solubilized immune complexes were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Gels were either dried and autoradiographed directly, or the samples were transferred to nitrocellulose, then autoradiographed and subjected to immunoblot analysis when needed. For the phosphatase experiment, the Ste20p immune complexes were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 100 μl of phosphatase buffer containing 0.5 units of protein phosphatase 2A. Control incubations were performed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid at 30 nm to inhibit protein phosphatase 2A, or in the absence of phosphatases. For the immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged protein complexes, cell extracts, prepared as described above except for the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100, were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 2 μl of anti-HA antibody pre-absorbed onto 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads in lysis buffer with 1% bovine serum albumin. The immune complexes were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and twice with kinase buffer. The kinase reactions were started by adding 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μm ATP and 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (4, 500 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml), 2 μg of GST-Ste20pK649R, or 2 μg of histone H1 as substrates, incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, and subjected to SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and immunoblot analyses. Relative phosphorylation levels were determined either by densitometric analyses of the autoradiogram or by scintillation counting the radioactivity, and normalized to the amount of the relevant proteins which were determined by densitometric analyses of immunoblot blots using the ECL system. Cells were grown as indicated, sonicated, fixed with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 3.7% with 150 mm NaCl, and viewed with a microscope equipped with Nomarski optics, and photographs were taken with a 100× objective. GFP fluorescence was visualized with a Leitz photomicroscope equipped with UV light source, and microscopic photographs were acquired with a 100× objective using a Micro Max camera (Princeton Instruments Inc.) and Northern Eclipse imaging software (Empix Imaging Inc.), and processed using Adobe Photoshop for MacIntosh. In response to pheromone treatment, yeast cells arrest as unbudded, G1 phase cells (39Bucking-Throm E. Duntze W. Hartwell L.H. Manney T.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 76: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 40Hartwell L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 76: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We observed that immunoblots of Ste20p isolated from log phase and pheromone-treated cultures revealed differences in the migration pattern of the protein. Ste20p from cells of pheromone-arrested cultures migrated as a relatively compact, fast-migrating band, while Ste20p from log phase cells appeared as a slower-migrating smear (Fig. 1 A). Removal of pheromone resulted in the appearance of slow-migrating Ste20p within 30 min; this change in the modification of Ste20p correlated with the timing of bud emergence. The diminution of the slow-migrating form of Ste20p caused by pheromone treatment could result either from the cells containing an activated pheromone response pathway, or from the cells being blocked in cell cycle progression. Blocking the signal transduction pathway by mutations in either STE4 or STE5 (see Table I for list of strains) prevented the disappearance of the slow-migrating form of Ste20p (Fig. 1,B and D). Mutation in STE11 also prevented the disappearance of the slow-migrating species of Ste20p (data not shown). Most significantly, mutations in FAR1 also eliminated the reduction in the slow-migrating form of Ste20p (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, cell cycle arrest, and not simply activation of the pheromone pathway, is critical for the reduction of the slow-migrating form of Ste20p. Nutritional limitation also causes the arrest of yeast cells in G1 (41Wittenberg C. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 42Pringle J.R. Hartwell L.H. Broach J. Strathern J. Jones E. Molecular Biology of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Life Cycle and Inheritance. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 97-142Google Scholar). Analysis of Ste20p from saturated cultures also showed the diminution of the slow-migrating version of the protein (Fig. 2). Thus cycling cells, even in the presence of an activated pheromone response pathway, contain the modified form of Ste20p, while arrested cells contain the fast-migrating form of the protein.Table IStrainsW303–1AMAT a ade2 ura3 his3 leu2 trp1 can1R.

The mobility status of Ste20p from yeast strains with temperature-sensitiveCDC alleles was checked at both permissive and restrictive temperatures. As shown in Fig. 3, cells blocked at the cdc13–1 and to some extent thecdc20–1 arrest points contained Ste20p predominantly in the fast-moving state. Cdc13p is a telomere DNA-binding protein; lack of Cdc13p blocks at G2/M, after DNA replication, but before mitosis (43Nugent C.I. Hughes T.R. Lue N.F. Lundblad V. Science. 1996; 274: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 44Hartwell L.H. Smith D. Genetics. 1985; 110: 381-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cdc20p is a WD-40 repeat protein and a component of the anaphase-promoting complex that targets Pds1 for degradation, so lack of Cdc20p prevents sister chromatid separation (45Lim H.H. Surana U. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 46Lim H.H. Goh P.Y. Surana U. Curr Biol. 1998; 8: 231-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Sethi N. Monteagudo M.C. Koshland D. Hogan E. Burke D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5592-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutants blocked at the cdc7–1 arrest point contained the slow migrating form of Ste20p. Cdc7p is a protein kinase, and lack of Cdc7p blocks at G1/S boundary, after spindle pole body duplication, but before initiation of chromosomal DNA replication (48Patterson M. Sclafani R.A. Fangman W.L. Rosamond J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 49Yoon H.J. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, the fast-migrating, presumably less modified species of Ste20p was not due simply to nonspecific blockage of cell cycle progression. To monitor Ste20p modification throughout the cell cycle, a yeast strain with cdc28–13, which arrests cells at Start at the restrictive temperature, was used in a block and release experiment. As shown in Fig. 4, Ste20p from cells that had been blocked for 2.5 h at the restrictive temperature (37 °C) migrated as a compact, fast-migrating band. Ste20p remained as a fast-migrating species up to 30 min after release, during which time the cells were unbudded. However, Ste20p from cells released for 60 min appeared as a smeary band with the majority of the protein migrating slowly. This shift in the migration state of Ste20p correlated with the onset of budding, consistent with the trapping of Ste20p in the modified state in the cdc7–1 arrested cells, which are arrested prior to the onset of S-phase at restrictive temperature. This slow-migrating state was maintained until 90 min and then started to disappear at 120 min, at the point of transition from G2/M. The slow-migrating species of Ste20p, however, reappeared at 180 min after the cells were released from the arrest point. Cdc15p is a protein kinase in the Cdc20p-dependent pathway and required for the exit from mitosis; lack of Cdc15p blocks cells at late mitotic phase (51Irniger S. Piatti S. Michaelis C. Nasmyth K.

Application of different proteases yields either a peptide-bound heme (with trypsin and chymotrypsin) or a peptide-free heme (with proteinase K). Both heme l and heme l-peptide species were investigated by paramagnetic 1H NMR spectroscopy, electrospray mass spectrometry, and peptide sequence analysis.

Mammalian secretory fluids maintain antimicrobial activity as part of a nonspecific defense mechanism for the protection of mucosal surfaces against invading bacteria, parasites, and viruses (1Pruitt K.M. Tenovuo J.O. Immunology Series. Vol. 27. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, NY1985Google Scholar). Among the agents that provide antimicrobial protection in these fluids are the products of peroxide-driven oxidation of halide or pseudohalide ions, catalyzed by a family of hemoprotein enzymes collectively known as peroxidases. Lactoperoxidase (LPO)1 is a secretory peroxidase enzyme readily isolated from unpasteurized bovine milk. The enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain of 612 amino acid residues (2Dull T.J. Uyeda C. Strosberg A.D. Nedwin G. Seilhamer J.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Cals M. Mailliart P. Brignon G. Anglade P. Dumas B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), a heme prosthetic group, and four or five carbohydrate chains constituting a total of approximately 10% of the 78,000-dalton mass (4Carlstrom A. Acta Chem. Scand. 1969; 23: 171-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the most readily available enzyme of its class, LPO is often used as the benchmark for studies of mammalian peroxidases that require large quantities of material. The ability of LPO to efficiently catalyze the iodination of tyrosine residues has made it a particularly useful experimental model for the more arduously isolated thyroid peroxidase (5Kohler H. Taurog A. Dunford H.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Likewise, the enzyme provides an effective biocatalytic tool for mild radioiodination (compared with chloramine T) of proteins for clinical diagnostic applications (6Redman L.W. Tustanoff E.R. J. Immunoassy. 1984; 5: 29-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Although heme peroxidases isolated from plant and fungal sources contain the common iron-protoporphyrin IX (heme b, Fig. 1) prosthetic group, the properties of mammalian peroxidases have long implied the presence of a structurally different heme group (7Andersson L.A. Bylkas S.A. Wilson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3406-3412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Goff H.M. Gonzalez-Vergara E. Ales D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Similar chemical and spectroscopic properties among mammalian peroxidases isolated from various secretory fluids, as well as those from the thyroid gland and eosinophil leukocytes, suggest a common heme structure (10Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. Vol. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991Google Scholar). Additional diversity in heme structure is realized by the exceptional spectroscopic and oxidation properties seen for myeloperoxidase (MPO), the antimicrobial enzyme utilized in macrophage cells (11Hurst J.K. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 37-62Google Scholar). Several heme structures have been proposed for LPO. A covalent heme-protein linkage is suggested (12Hultquist D.E. Morrison M. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2843-2846Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) by the fact that the heme is not removed from the protein by simple organic extraction methods (commonly used for extraction of hemes a and b (13Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5008-5013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Proposals for heme alcohol, amine, or thiol functional groups accounted for possible ester, amide, or disulfide heme-protein linkages (12Hultquist D.E. Morrison M. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2843-2846Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 14Morell D.B. Clezy P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 71: 157-164Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Nichol A.W. Angel L.A. Moon T. Clezy P.S. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Yet another proposal concluded that the LPO heme is in fact only a heme b group that is unusually encapsulated by the surrounding protein (16Sievers G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Consensus has recently been reached about the general LPO heme structure and protein linkage. Isolation of the LPO heme species is achieved through proteolytic digestion of LPO followed by reverse-phase HPLC fractionation of the resulting digest mixture (17Rae T.D. Goff H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2103-2104Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18DePillis G.D. Ozaki S. Kuo J.M. Maltby D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8857-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A dialcohol heme l structure (Fig. 1) is consistent with preliminary paramagnetic 1H NMR analysis (17Rae T.D. Goff H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2103-2104Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and mass spectra (17Rae T.D. Goff H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2103-2104Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar,18DePillis G.D. Ozaki S.

Concurrently, this same heme l structure was proposed to explain magnetic circular dichroism data obtained from studies of LPO in comparison with MPO and a simple heme b protein (myoglobin) (7Andersson L.A. Bylkas S.A. Wilson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3406-3412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The conclusions were supported by structural details provided by the x-ray analysis of human MPO (19Fenna R. Zeng J. Davey C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in which an additional unique methionine sulfonium linkage is seen (19Fenna R. Zeng J. Davey C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 20Taylor K.L. Strobel F. Yue K.T. Ram P. Pohl J. Woods A.S. Kinkade J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Infrared vibrational measurements have also demonstrated the presence of ester groups attributed to heme-protein linkages in myeloperoxidase, lactoperoxidase, and eosinophil peroxidase (21Kooter I.M. Pierik A.J. Merkx M. Averill B.A. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. Wever R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11542-11543Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the recent findings are consistent with a heme l structure bearing 1- and 5-position hydroxymethyl side chains esterified to the protein, no direct evidence points to which LPO amino acids may be esterified. Hence, the heme l-protein linkages identified in Fig. 1 are presumptive on the basis of the MPO x-ray structure. This report describes confirmation of the linkage sites through partial proteolytic digestion of LPO to give a series of heme peptide derivatives. Peptide sequences reveal the expected conserved polypeptide regions to which the heme is esterified in MPO. Spectroscopic data for heme l and a series of heme l-peptides also provide information regarding the effects of the hydroxymethyl and ester functionalities on the electronic properties of the unique mammalian prosthetic group. LPO was isolated from fresh, raw bovine (Guernsey) milk by the procedure of Goff and co-workers (8Goff H.M. Gonzalez-Vergara E. Ales D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Concentrations were determined by a 1.14 × 105cm−1m−1 extinction coefficient for the heme Soret band maximum at 412 nm. Proteinase K fromTritirachium album was a commercially supplied enzyme of Amresco. Trypsin (type III, non-TCPK treated) and chymotrypsin (type II) were purchased from Sigma. Two proteolytic schemes were used in order to obtain optimal quantities of either peptide-free LPO heme (trypsin and proteinase K) or peptide-bound LPO heme species (trypsin and chymotrypsin). Prior to the application of proteases in both schemes, LPO in a 100 mm phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8) was concentrated to 50–100 μm in an Amicon stir cell with a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane, followed by deoxygenation of the solution under a N2 flow with stirring for 1 h. Disulfide reducing agents such as mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol were strictly avoided due to the likelihood of heme modification with these thiol reagents. To optimize digestion, the LPO was heat-denatured by immersion of the protein solution in a 90 °C water bath for approximately 5 min or until all LPO appeared to be precipitated. This solution with LPO in suspension was then adjusted to a pH of 8.0 for optimal protease activity. All proteolytic digestions were performed at room temperature. A typical trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion utilized 80 mg of heat-treated LPO suspended in 10 ml of aqueous buffer (pH 8.0). The protein suspension was initially treated with 0.7 mg of trypsin for approximately 3 h until the LPO precipitate cleared. Both trypsin and chymotrypsin (0.7 mg each) were then added and allowed to hydrolyze the LPO protein for 18 h before another 0.7 mg of each was added. Aliquots of digest solution (20 μl) were taken during the digestion and run on reverse-phase HPLC (as described below, although on an analytical scale) to monitor the progression of proteolysis. Digestion was halted after 28 h by the addition of 20% trifluoroacetic acid solution to pH 2.5. The LPO digest solution was then concentrated under vacuum to a volume of 3 ml for separation by semipreparative reverse-phase HPLC. The combined trypsin and proteinase K digestion was performed on 40 mg of heat-treated LPO suspended in 10 ml of aqueous buffer (pH 8.0). The protein suspension was prehydrolyzed with 1.0 mg of trypsin for 1 h until the precipitate cleared, after which 1.0 mg of proteinase K was added. A 28-h proteolysis period was allowed before the addition of another 1.0 mg of proteinase K. Digestion was halted after a total time of 48 h by acidification of the digest solution to pH 2.4 with 20% trifluoroacetic acid. This LPO digest solution was directly fractionated by semipreparative reverse-phase HPLC. Prior to HPLC separation of the LPO digests, larger protein fragments can be separated from the desired smaller fragments by gel permeation chromatography (Sepahadex G-25, H2O mobile phase). The digest is separated into a larger molecular weight red heme fraction and a small molecular weight green heme fraction. Redigestion of the larger molecular weight fraction gives an additional quantity of smaller molecular weight heme species. All high performance liquid chromatographic separations were performed on a Varian Star HPLC system with a 9012 solvent delivery pump and 9050 variable wavelength UV-visible detector. LPO digest mixtures from both schemes were separated on a Vydac 218TP 10 mm × 25 cm semipreparative C18 column with a 0.5–1.0-ml sample injection volume. A two-solvent (A = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O; B = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN) gradient mobile phase of 0–40% solvent B (0–60 min), followed by 40–100% solvent B (60–90 min) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min was applied to elute the proteolytic fragments. Detection of the heme-containing fractions eluting from the column was monitored by absorbance at 400 nm. Five major heme fractions as numbered in Fig. 2 A were collected from the trypsin/chymotrypsin LPO digest. The single major heme fraction obtained from the trypsin/proteinase K-digested LPO was collected along with two minor fractions as labeled in Fig. 2 B. A series of repeated injections were performed as necessary to achieve the separation of the total digest sample volume from each scheme. All fractions collected and combined from repeated injections were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. Additional purification of the isolated heme moieties for peptide analysis and mass spectrometry was accomplished on a Vydac 218TP 4.6 mm × 25 cm analytical C18 column with a two solvent (A = 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O; B = 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 20% H2O, 80% CH3CN) mobile phase gradient of 100% A (0–5 min), 0–50% B (5–30 min), 50–100% B (30–40 min) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Material selected for further purification was subjected to HPLC separation in 50–100-μl injection volumes after being redissolved in a minimal amount (∼0.5 ml) of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid H2O. For some heme fractions, up to 20% CH3CN was needed to completely dissolve the lyophilizate. The detector wavelength was alternatively set at 400 and 215 nm to examine the effective removal of contaminant peptides from the desired heme species. Heme fractions were collected and combined after repeated injections and then lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. The twice-purified fractions designated TC-4 and TC-5 from the trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion of LPO were dissolved in 3.0 ml of 1.0 mm Na2CO3. After pH adjustment to 10.6 with dilute NaOH, the heme-peptide was allowed to hydrolyze for 20 h at room temperature. Hydrolysis was terminated by the addition of 5.0 μl of aqueous 20% trifluoroacetic acid (bringing the solution to pH 2.3) before the solvent was removed under vacuum. The dried residue was dissolved in a minimal volume (∼200 μl) of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O and subjected to the same analytical column HPLC method used to purify the original heme-peptide species. Fractions eluting without 400-nm absorbance but detectable 215-nm absorbance were collected and lyophilized. Fractions were confirmed as peptides by 1H NMR in Me2SO-d 6. Further purification of peptide fractions prior to sequence analysis was accomplished on a Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech with an isocratic mobile phase of 1:3 CH3CN/H2O (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Isolated and lyophilized peptides were dissolved in water and sequenced on a Procise 492 protein sequencer by Applied Biosystems with conversion of amino acids to their stable phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives. Paramagnetic proton NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-600 FT NMR spectrometer. Samples utilized for NMR spectroscopy consisted of semipreparatory HPLC heme fractions that were lyophilized and dissolved in deuterated solvents. No further purification of these samples was necessary to selectively assign paramagnetically influenced proton resonances of the LPO heme. Chemical shift values are referenced to the residual Me2SO signal at 2.5 ppm, calibrated in turn with tetramethylsilane. Proton NMR spectra for the high spin bis(Me2SO)-Fe(III)heme complexes (30–50 μm) in Me2SO-d 6 were obtained over a 120-kHz spectral width with 8000 data points. Scans (500,000–800,000) were acquired at a repetition rate of 20 s−1. Resulting free induction decays were subjected to a 50-Hz exponential multiplication line-broadening factor and transformed with zero filling to 16,000 data points. Resonance assignments for the bis(Me2SO) high spin complex were made through the combination of integrated intensities and relation to assignments made for heme b (22Budd D.L. La Mar G.N. Langry K.C. Smith K.M. Nayyir-Mazhir R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 6091-6096Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Proton NMR experiments for the low spin bis(CN)-Fe(III)heme complex were executed on a peptide-free heme sample obtained from LPO by the trypsin/proteinase K digestion scheme (heme species PK-2). Inversion-recovery, variable temperature, and COSY spectra were collected for a ∼200 μm heme sample in 1:1 Me2SO-d 6/D2O with 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid-d 1. All one-dimensional spectra were acquired over a spectral width of 30 kHz with 32,000 data points, using a 5-Hz exponential multiplication line-broadening factor before Fourier transformation. Nonselective T1 values for heme proton resonances were calculated from a standard inversion-recovery sequence. Curie plots were constructed from spectra acquired with an inversion-recovery sequence (τ = 400 ms) to detect heme proton resonances within the diamagnetic region. Sample temperatures were calibrated with the methanol thermometer technique of Van Geet (23Van Geet A.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 679-680Crossref Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Magnitude COSY data were acquired in 128 blocks over a spectral width of 30 kHz with 2000 data points, and 2048 scans per block were collected at a repetition rate of 1 s−1. Sample temperature for the COSY experiment was 336 K. A 90° shifted sine-bell window function was applied over 1000 points in the t1 dimension to enhance the paramagnetically relaxed resonances. An unshifted sine-bell was applied over all points in the t2 dimension. Steady-state NOE difference experiments on the bis(CN)-Fe(III)heme complex (∼200 μm) were performed under variable solvent and temperature conditions to resolve both the irradiated and observed NOE resonances for each specific experiment. Solvent composition and temperature parameters for individual experiments are listed in Table III. The increased viscosity of the mixed Me2SO-d 6/D2O solvent at low temperatures was required to obtain detectable NOEs. Given that the intensity of an NOE signal (η) is dictated by theT 1 of the detected NOE resonance nucleus (i) as well as the cross-relaxation (ς) between nuclei as follows,ηij=ςij·T1i,(Eq. 1) small T 1 values due to paramagnetic relaxation cause much smaller NOE intensities for heme resonances (24Dugad L.B.

Rev. 1992; 120: 1-28Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Viscous solvent conditions were employed to slow the tumbling time of the heme complex. This served to enhance the cross-relaxation between proton NOE pairs and increase the absolute intensities of the NOE signals (negative). Under nonviscous solvent conditions (such as D2O only), NOEs could not be detected for the heme complex at submillimolar concentrations (∼200 μm in these experiments) due to the fast relaxation and large line width of the heme proton resonances. Saturation of selected resonances was accomplished with a low power pulse during the relaxation delay time of 200–400 ms. Difference spectra were obtained by subtraction of raw free induction decay data of a reference experiment from an identical experiment with the selected resonance saturated. An irradiation frequency for the reference was placed equidistant from any nearby signal to account for off-resonance saturation effects in each NOE difference experiment. In a typical experiment, 25,000–40,000 scans were acquired for both the reference and selected resonance saturation spectra, with 32,000 data points over a 30-kHz spectral width. After semipreparatory reverse-phase HPLC, LPO heme fractions were lyophilized and subsequently chromatographed on a Superex Peptide HR gel permeation column under the same conditions used to further purify peptides for sequence analysis. The desired heme species were taken up in 1:1 CH3OH/H2O with 0.5% CH3COOH to a concentration of 10–40 ng/μl and injected into an Autospec Electrospray mass spectrometer from Micromass. Data were acquired in positive ion mode. The same solvent mixture was used to deliver the sample. Molecular masses were either found for the singly charged heme species or determined for a series of multiply charged species on OPUS (version 3.3) processing software. Verification of the peptide-free heme molecular mass was accomplished by fast atom bombardment ionization (xenon, 8 kV) on a ZAB-HF mass spectrometer from VG Analytical in both glycerol and 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol matrices. Several LPO heme species are recovered from reverse-phase HPLC separation of the digests resulting from application of the two protease combinations. Protein removal by a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin yields a number of major fragments with 400-nm absorbance (Fig. 2 A). Digestion with trypsin followed by proteinase K yields one clearly dominant 400-nm absorbing species (Fig. 2 B), although minor species are also present in the digest. Similar results were reported for proteinase K digestion of MPO (20Taylor K.L. Strobel F. Yue K.T. Ram P. Pohl J. Woods A.S. Kinkade J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), where one clearly dominant heme m species was recovered when proteolysis was applied after an autolytic cleavage of heme-protein bonds by high temperature acidic incubation (27Taylor K.L. Pohl J. Kinkade Jr., J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25282-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same single heme species (PK-2) was obtained from LPO in this study whether or not the acid treatment conditions were applied prior to proteinase K digestion. However, the minor species had different retention times and were of slightly larger relative quantities when trypsin predigestion was used in place of the acid treatment procedure. The major heme species (PK-2) (∼60–70% total heme in digest), along with the two largest of the minor species (PK-1 and -3) (∼5–8% total heme in digest) were collected for structural analysis following HPLC separation of trypsin/proteinase K-digested LPO (40 mg). Five major heme fractions (TC-1 to -5) were collected from the trypsin/chymotrypsin LPO digest (80 mg). These five species were consistently the dominant heme products from trypsin/chymotrypsin proteolysis of LPO with variable digest times and protease concentrations. Relative quantities of the five species varied with digest conditions (TC-1, -2, -3, and -5 were obtained as approximately 3–10% each of the total heme in the digest), although TC-4 (∼15–20% of the total heme in the digest) was in all cases the largest fraction. One of the major heme fractions from the trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion of LPO (TC-2) was found to elute with the same retention time as the major heme fraction resulting from proteinase K digestion (PK-2). The quantity of this second major fraction from the trypsin/chymotrypsin digest (TC-2) was increased significantly relative to the other major species when the digest mixture was briefly exposed to alkaline conditions prior to HPLC separation (data not shown). Electronic spectra for the major isolated heme species show a decrease in absorptivity below 300 nm, thus suggesting loss of much of the native protein content. The R z value (A Soret/A 280 or heme to protein absorbance), was increased severalfold from native LPO in all species. The shift in Soret band position from 412 nm for the native LPO enzyme to 400 nm for the isolated heme species is consistent with the replacement of the protein histidine imidazole ligand with a solvent ligand. As is the case for the trypsin/chymotrypsin whole digest mixture, exposure of the TC-4 isolated heme fraction to alkaline aqueous solutions yields a heme species with retention time equal to that of TC-2 and PK-2 (Fig. 3 D). Base treatment of species TC-5 gave not only an apparent TC-2 species but another 400-nm species with a retention time corresponding to TC-4 (Fig. 3 B). With the interconversion of these heme fractions, additional species without 400-nm absorbance but with significant 215-nm absorbance were produced. TC-4 and TC-5 each produced two species with 215-nm absorbance upon treatment with aqueous solutions of Na2CO3. The earliest eluting species derived from TC-4 and TC-5, designated as TC-4P and TC-5P1 in Fig. 3,A and C, respectively, had identical retention times. 1H NMR spectra of TC-4P and TC-5P1 were also identical and displayed five clearly resolved amide doublet resonances (δ) of 7.85, 8.06, 8.09, 8.17, and 8.56 ppm, which identify them as the same hexapeptide. TC-5P2 likewise gave a spectrum identifying it as a peptide but with several overlapping signals in the amide region (7.5–9 ppm). The second 215-nm absorbing species derived from base treatment of TC-4 (marked with an X in Fig. 3 C) displayed no proton resonance signals to qualify it as a peptide, and is probably a heme degradation product. Amino acid sequences determined for these two isolated peptides were as follows: TC-4P (and TC-5P1), Ala-Ser-Glu-Gln-Ile-Leu; TC-5P2, Gly-Gln-Ile-Val-Asp-His-Asp-Leu-Asp-Phe-Ala-Pro-Glu-Thr-Glu-Leu. Both sequences correspond to regions found in the total amino acid sequence of bovine LPO (2Dull T.J. Uyeda C. Strosberg A.D. Nedwin G. Seilhamer J.J.

Biochem. 1991; 198: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The hexapeptide originates as amino acids Ala273–Leu278, and the 16-amino acid peptide as Gly121–Leu136. Despite the reported similarity in pyridine hemochrome spectra (16Sievers G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the paramagnetic1H NMR spectra of the LPO heme and common heme b reveal clear differences. The most obvious distinction between the hemes in both high spin and low spin iron(III) spectra is the detection of only two methyl signals from the LPO heme (Figs. 4 and 5) in the spectral region where the four methyl resonances are detected for heme b (Fig. 4).

The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has twoRAS genes, RAS1 and RAS2, whose protein products are structurally, functionally, and biochemically similar to mammalian Ras proto-oncoproteins (for reviews, see Refs. 1Broach J.R.

The yeast Ras proteins are essential regulatory elements of adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the production of cAMP, a second messenger vital for cell growth (3Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S.

The Ras-adenylyl cyclase pathway has been implicated in transduction of a signal triggered by glucose to an intracellular environment where a protein phosphorylation cascade is induced by cAMP. Yeast cells bearing the activatedRAS2 gene, RAS2 Val-19, exhibit an elevated level of intracellular cAMP and display abnormal phenotypes, including sensitivity to heat shock, sensitivity to nutritional starvation, and failure to sporulate (3Toda T.

Yeast adenylyl cyclase, encoded by the CYR1 gene, consists of 2026-amino acid residues that comprise at least four domains: the N-terminal, the middle leucine-rich repeat, the catalytic, and the C-terminal domains (6Kataoka T.

Adenylyl cyclase forms a complex with 70-kDa CAP.1 CAP was identified biochemically as the only protein associated tightly with adenylyl cyclase and also by genetic screening of a gene whose mutation abolished the RAS2 Val-19-dependent heat shock sensitivity (10Field J.

It was shown that the N-terminal region, mapped to residues 1–168, is required for acquisition of heat shock sensitivity in theRAS2 Val-19 background while the C-terminal region, mapped to residues 369–526, is required for normal cell morphology and responsiveness to nutrient deprivation and excess (12Gerst J.E. Ferguson K. Vojtek A. Wigler M. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The C-terminal function appears to be related to regulation of the actin cytoskeleton as evidenced by complementation of its defect by overexpression of profilin or SNC1 (13Vojtek A.B. Harrer B.

In addition, CAP possesses two proline-rich sequences in its middle region intervening between the two regions, with which associations of actin-binding protein 1, elongation factor 1α, and ribosomal protein L3 were recently shown (17Freeman L.N.

The N-terminal region of CAP binds to the C-terminal region of adenylyl cyclase (19Wang J. Suzuki N. Nishida Y. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4087-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and this association appears to be required for the proper in vivo response of adenylyl cyclase to Ras, because its loss by mutation of either CAP or adenylyl cyclase resulted in disappearance of theRAS2 Val-19-dependent heat shock sensitivity and in a reduced cAMP response to glucose stimulation (19Wang J. Suzuki N. Nishida Y. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4087-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This function resides solely in the CAP N-terminal region and is separable from the functions of the other regions as reported (12Gerst J.E. Ferguson K. Vojtek A. Wigler M. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have recently shown biochemically that the association of adenylyl cyclase with the CAP N-terminal region is responsible for efficient stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by the posttranslationally modified form of Ras, although the molecular mechanism underlying this process remains to be clarified (20Shima F.

In this report, we have mapped a minimal region of CAP responsible for its N-terminal function and analyzed the molecular mechanism for its association with adenylyl cyclase. The S. cerevisiaestrains used are listed in Table I. Replacement of the chromosomal CAP gene with its N-terminal deletion mutant CAPΔN-1 was carried out as described previously (20Shima F.

The resulting yeast strain expresses only the C-terminal segment of CAP corresponding to residues 369–526 under control of the yeast ADC1 promoter.

Various deletions were introduced into the CAP gene by cleavage of pAD-GST-CAP with suitable pairs of restriction endonucleases and resealing by T4 DNA ligase with a linker oligonucleotide, 5′-CTAGTCTAGACTAG-3′, bearing stop codons in all reading frames, between. The resulting plasmids were designated as pAD-GST-CAP-(x–x)s, where x–x represents the range of the expressed CAP polypeptides in amino acid positions. A 5′-terminal 107-base pair fragment corresponding to residues 1–36 of CAP, CAP-(1–36), was amplified by PCR (23Saiki R.K. Scharf S. Faloona F. Mullis K.B. Horn G.T. Erlich H.A. Arnheim N.

Similarly, DNA fragments encoding various C-terminal polypeptides of adenylyl cyclase were amplified by PCR using suitable primers and cloned into pAD-GST to produce pAD-GST-CYR1-(y–y), where y–y represented the range of the expressed adenylyl cyclase polypeptide in amino acid positions.

The reporter yeast strain YPB2(CAPΔN) was cotransformed with pGAD-CYR1-(y–y) and pGBT-CAP-(x–x), and the resulting Trp+, Leu+-transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by a filter assay as described (25Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). A DNA fragment corresponding to CAP-(1–77), was subjected to an error-prone PCR to introduce random mutations as described before (26Gram H. Marconi L.-A. Barbas III, C.F. Collet T.A. Lerner R.A.

The amplified fragments were cleaved with BamHI and SmaI present in the PCR primers, cloned into matching cleavage sites of pGBT10, and examined for interaction with pGAD-CYR1-(1879–2026) by the yeast two-hybrid assay as described above. The CAP mutants that failed to interact with CYR1(1879–2026) were characterized by DNA sequencing and transferred to pAD-GST for expression as GST-fusion proteins in yeast cells. Yeast FS1 was transformed with a combination of either YEP24-ADC1-CYR1-(1–40, 1769–2026) or YEP24-ADC1-CYR1-(1–40, 606–2026) and one of the pAD-GST-CAP-(x–x) plasmids bearing various mutations. In another series of experiments, SP1 was transformed with pAD-GST-CYR1-(y–y) bearing various mutations.

GST-CAP-(x–x) or GST-CYR1-(y–y) protein was solubilized from the crude membrane fraction with buffer C containing 1% Lubrol PX, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose resin, and eluted with 20 mm glutathione as described (27Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Proteins bound to the GST-fusion proteins, which were co-eluted from the resin, were subjected to Western immunoblot detection of CYR1 or CAP by using specific antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antisera for a 15-amino acid synthetic peptide of the C terminus of adenylyl cyclase (anti-CYR1CT) or for the full-length CAP (anti-CAP), respectively, as described previously (19Wang J. Suzuki N. Nishida Y. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4087-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum for GST (anti-GST) was used for detection of GST fusion proteins. Survival of yeast cells after heat shock treatment at 55 °C for 5 min was examined by a replica plating method as described previously (3Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblot analysis were performed as described (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar, 29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The ECL immunodetection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for signal development. Previous experiments had already mapped the N-terminal function of CAP to residues 1–168 (12Gerst J.E. Ferguson K. Vojtek A. Wigler M. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and the CAP-binding site of adenylyl cyclase to residues 1879–2026 (19Wang J. Suzuki N. Nishida Y. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4087-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To further delineate the binding sites, we introduced various deletion mutations into CAP and adenylyl cyclase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Interactions of the various CAP mutants with CYR1-(1879–2026) and of the various CYR1 C-terminal mutants with CAP were examined by employing the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1 A). As an indicator strain, we used YPB2(CAPΔN), whose chromosomal CAP gene was replaced by its N-terminal deletion mutant CAPΔN-1 in order to exclude the possibility that endogenous CAP complexed with an otherwise negative GAD-fusion CAP mutant may serve as a bridge to yield a positive interaction with the GBT-fusion CYR1. Formation of such a CAP dimer had been reported before (16Zelicof A. Protopopov V. David D. Lin X.-Y. Lustgarten V. Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18243-18252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To our surprise, the shortest CAP construct carrying only the N-terminal 36 residues, CAP-(1–36), as well as the longer CAP-(1–66), CAP-(1–77), and CAP-(1–88) exhibited a positive interaction with the C-terminal region of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, CAP-(78–526) lacking the N-terminal region did not exhibit any interaction. On the other hand, the shortest fragment of CYR1 giving a positive interaction with CAP was 119 residues corresponding to positions 1898–2016 (Fig. 1 A). An N-terminal deletion up to position 1935 destroyed the activity to interact with CAP. Physical associations of the same sets of CAP and CYR1 mutants with their counterparts were also examined biochemically as shown in Fig. 1,B and C. The CAP deletion mutants were expressed as GST fusions from pAD-GST-CAP-(x–x)s in yeast FS1 cells harboring YEP24-ADC1-CYR1-(1–40, 1769–2026). The GST-CAP fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography and examined for the bound CYR1-(1–40, 1769–2026) by immunoblotting with anti-CYR1CT antibody (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, proteins copurified with GST-CYR1-(y–y)s from yeast cells harboring pAD-GST-CYR1-(y–y)s were examined for CAP by anti-CAP antibody (Fig. 1 C). The results were in good agreement with those of the yeast two-hybrid analysis; the shortest CAP and CYR1 fragments that retained the activity to associate with their counterparts were CAP-(1–36) and CYR1-(1898–2016), respectively. These results indicated that residues 1–36 of CAP and residues 1898–2016 of adenylyl cyclase are sufficient for their mutual association. We examined the abilities of the CAP deletion mutants to confer heat shock sensitivity to TK161-R2V(CAPΔN) cells, which carried the CAPΔN-1 gene encoding the protein lacking its N-terminal function and thereby were made resistant to heat shock in the RAS2 Val-19 background. As shown in Fig. 2 A, expression of the shortest fragment, GST-CAP-(1–36), as well as other longer CAP N-terminal fragments was sufficient to restore the heat shock sensitivity in this yeast strain. As observed in the binding assays, both GST-CAP-(77–526) and GST only were found inactive. This result implied that the N-terminal 36 residues are functional in the Ras-adenylyl cyclase pathway. Heat shock sensitivity was also used for examining the CAP binding activity of various CYR1 fragments. It had been shown that overexpression of the CAP-binding region of adenylyl cyclase suppressed the RAS2 Val-19-dependent heat shock sensitivity presumably by competitive sequestration of CAP from the endogenous adenylyl cyclase (19Wang J. Suzuki N. Nishida Y. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4087-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We examined the activity of the CYR1-deletion mutants overexpressed from pAD-GST-CYR1-(y–y) to suppress the heat shock sensitivity of TK161-R2V (Fig. 2B). Again, the result was in good agreement with that of the CAP-binding assays,i.e. CYR1-(1898–2016) was the shortest fragment exhibiting this activity. The mutually interacting regions, CAP-(1–36) and CYR1-(1898–2016), were searched for a peculiar sequence motif hinting at the mechanism of their interaction. The search identified tandem repetitions of a heptad motif αXXαXXX (where α and X represent a hydrophobic amino acid and any amino acid, respectively; for reviews, see Refs. 30Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 245-248Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (301) Google Scholar and 31Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) in both residues 13–30 of CAP and residues 1916–1930 of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 3 A). If the heptad repeat motif is taken as that of a leucine zipper LXXXXXX (32Landschultz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2513) Google Scholar), adenylyl cyclase has one more repeat unit in residues 1931–1937. These heptad repeats enabled us to predict formation of α-helices that are wound around each other to form a superhelix, the coiled-coil structure (30Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 245-248Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 31Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). This was also supported by calculation of the probability of adopting a coiled-coil conformation using the computer program COILS (33Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Residues 11–33 of CAP were predicted to have more than 95% probability of forming a coiled-coil, whereas the probability for the other portion of CAP was almost 0. To further analyze the molecular mechanism for the CAP-adenylyl cyclase interaction, we introduced random mutations into residues 1–77 of CAP by an error-prone PCR and carried out a yeast two-hybrid screening for mutants that became defective in associating with adenylyl cyclase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Out of 208 clones analyzed, 43 showed up negative in interacting with CYR1-(1879–2026) and were subjected to DNA sequencing to identify the nature of mutations. 33 clones carrying a stop codon or more than two mutations within residues 1–36 were discarded, and CAP-(1–77) inserts of the remaining 10 clones, whose mutations are shown in Table II, were transferred to pAD-GST for expression as GST-fusion proteins in the yeast FS-1. GST-CAP-(1–77) proteins derived from all 10 clones were expressed in a similar amount and solubilizable from the membranes by Lubrol PX, but those from five clones (HS92, HS113, HS143, HS155, and HS197) were found to have lost the ability to attach onto glutathione-Sepharose resin (data not shown), suggesting gross alterations in their conformations, and, therefore, were excluded from further analyses. The remaining five clones were examined for physical association with a deletion mutant CYR1 protein that retained the Ras-responsive adenylyl cyclase activity (8Suzuki N. Choe H.-R. Nishida Y. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Ohnishi S. Tamaoki T. Kataoka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8711-8715Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). The results clearly indicated that GST-CAP-(1–77) from the five clones HS10, HS27, HS139, HS205, and HS208 lost the ability to associate with CYR1-(1–40, 606–2026). Concurrently, the same CAP mutants lost the activity to confer heat shock sensitivity to TK161-R2V(CAPΔN) yeast cells (Fig. 5 A). Strikingly, four out of the five clones turned out to carry an amino acid substitution mutation at Leu-20, Leu-27, or Val-30, all of which corresponded to the key hydrophobic residues in the heptad repeats (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, the mutations were introduced in such a way that the hydrophobic residues were converted to neutral or hydrophilic residues (Table II). The other clone HS205 carried two mutations, T31P and Q34L. Although Gln-34 is located at the position in the heptad repeats corresponding to the key hydrophobic residue, it is presently unclear which of the two mutations is responsible for the effect.Table IIAmino acid substitutions found in CAP mutantsMutant CAP clonesMutations in residues 1–36HS10V30DHS27L20P, D29GHS92Q9LHS113T24AHS139L27SHS143T31AHS155Y6L, T7AHS197L16RHS205T31P, Q34LHS208L20P Open table in a new tab Figure 5Heat shock sensitivity of yeast cells expressing the mutated CAP and adenylyl cyclase.

The experiments were repeated three times, yielding identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we examined the importance of hydrophobic residues in the predicted heptad repeats of adenylyl cyclase in association with CAP. The key hydrophobic residues Leu-1916 and Leu-1923 corresponding to the α-position (Fig. 3 A) were converted to Ser and to either Pro or Arg, respectively, by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The CYR1 C-terminal fragments carrying L1916S, L1923P, and L1923R mutations all lost the ability to associate with CAP as assayed by the yeast two-hybrid method (Fig. 4 B) or by the in vivobinding assay (Fig. 4 C). Overexpression of CYR1-(1822–2026) bearing the same mutations could not suppress theRAS2 Val-19-dependent heat shock sensitivity (Fig. 5 B). These results indicated that the hydrophobic residues of both CAP and adenylyl cyclase are indeed critical not only for their mutual association but also for their proper function in the Ras-adenylyl cyclase pathway and further supported the involvement of the coiled-coil mechanism for their interaction. We have shown that the N-terminal 36 residues of CAP are sufficient for association with adenylyl cyclase as well as for itsin vivo function in the Ras-adenylyl cyclase pathway. The CAP-binding site of adenylyl cyclase was mapped to a 119-residue segment near the C terminus. Close inspection of the primary sequences of the two mutual binding sites has identified typical heptad repeat motifs (αXXαXXX)n indicative of a coiled-coil interaction (30Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 245-248Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 31Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, the presence of the coiled-coil in the CAP N terminus was predicted by the computer program COILS (33Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coiled-coils are composed of two, three, or four α-helices wound around each other to form a left-handed superhelix. This structure is found in a wide variety of proteins including cytoskeletal structural proteins, transcription factors, etc. (30Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 245-248Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 31Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Further, a number of proteins whose three-dimensional structures have been determined are found to contain coiled-coil segments, many of them very short. The presence of this structure in a protein can be predicted from an array of the typical heptad motif in its amino acid sequence, which is labeled a-b-c-d-e-f-g, where a and d are primarily hydrophobic, most frequently Leu, residues and form the helix interface, whileb, c, e, f, and g are hydrophilic and form the solvent-exposed surface of the coiled-coil. The association of the helices is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions at the side chains of the hydrophobic residuesa and d, which form an apolar stripe along one side of the helix, and additionally by ionic interactions at the side chains of the nearby charged residues. This is apparent in spinning wheel representations of the two possibly interacting segments CAP-(6–34) and CYR1-(1916–1940) (Fig. 3 B). The assignments of the a- and d-positions were supported by an amino acid sequence homology between CAP-(6–34) and Dirofilaria immitis paramyosin (34Limberger R.J. McReynolds L.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which was found by BLASTP search (35Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) of GenBankTM entries. Residues 16–29 of CAP (Fig. 3 A) shared nine identical residues with residues 213–226 of paramyosin (LAQQLEEARRRLED). This match made it possible to predict positions a–g of each residue of CAP from the proposed α-helical structure of paramyosin (36McLachlan A.D. Karn J. Nature. 1982; 299: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). A further proof for the coiled-coil interaction came from the studies on mutations of CAP and adenylyl cyclase, which abrogated the interaction. Strikingly, the three residues of CAP (Leu-20, Leu-27, and Val-30) and two residues of adenylyl cyclase (Leu-1916 and Leu-1923) that were identified to be essential for the interaction based on these mutational studies are all hydrophobic and located at positiona or d. These results strongly support the notion that the coiled-coil mechanism forms a molecular basis for the CAP-adenylyl cyclase interaction. At present, it is impossible for us to predict from the amino acid sequences how many strands of CAP and adenylyl cyclase contribute to the formation of the coiled-coil superhelix. It is also impossible to predict the relative orientation, parallel or anti-parallel, of the strands of CAP and adenylyl cyclase and how individual pairs of the residues from each strand are formed, both of which are primarily determined by polar and ionic interactions between residues flanking the hydrophobic core (30Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 245-248Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 31Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Elucidation of these structural features awaits determination of the three-dimensional structure of the CAP-adenylyl cyclase complex. The heptad repeat structure is well conserved in CAP homologues identified in other organisms including Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mammals, although the N-terminal function of the budding yeast CAP is not conserved among them (37Kawamukai M. Gerst J. Field J. Riggs M. Rodgers L. Wigler M. Young D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 38Matviw H., Yu, G. Young D. Mol. Cell.

Cooper J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 777-785PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that in those organisms CAP may establish a coiled-coil interaction at its N-terminal short segment with a certain protein to exert a function that is presumably different from that of the Ras-adenylyl cyclase pathway. The identification of such a CAP-interacting protein may reveal a novel function of CAP in addition to its C-terminal cytoskeletal function, which is known to be conserved between yeasts and mammals (37Kawamukai M.

The constitutive MAPK activity and serum-independent proliferation of V12H10 cells are sensitive to the growth factor antagonist, suramin (Hamilton, M., and Wolfman, A. (1998)Oncogene 16, 1417–1428), suggesting that Ha-Ras-mediated regulation of the MAPK cascade is dependent upon the action of an autocrine factor. Serum-free medium conditioned by V12H10 cells contains an activity that stimulates MAPK activity in quiescent fibroblasts. This MAPK stimulatory activity could be specifically blocked by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, PD153035 and PD158780. These inhibitors also blocked the serum-independent proliferation of V12H10 cells. Immunodepletion of conditioned medium with antibodies to transforming growth factor α and EGF significantly inhibited its ability to stimulate MAPK activity. Stable transfection of EGFR-negative NR6 and EGFR-positive Swiss3T3 cells with oncogenic (G12V)Ha-Ras demonstrated that only the Ha-Ras-transfected Swiss 3T3 cells possessed constitutive MAPK activity, and this activity was sensitive to PD153035.

The Ras GTPases are critical transducers of signals that are initiated from plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinases and terminate in the nucleus as changes in gene expression. The c-Ras1 proteins are implicated in the regulation of multiple biological processes as diverse as cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. In most instances, the expression of mutated, oncogenic forms of Ras results in cell transformation. The loss of normal growth control may result in the acquisition of anchorage-independent growth and a diminished requirement for exogenous serum or growth factors (1Pironin M. Clement G. Benzakour O. Barritault D. Lawrence D. Vigier P. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 51: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and are intimately related to the ability of Ras to stimulate the MAPK cascade, a critical component of the proliferative response (2Howe L.R.

Deregulated cell proliferation is thought to be one consequence of activated Ras signaling directly and persistently through the Raf kinases, upstream mediators of the MAPK cascade. Ras transformation can also be accompanied by the synthesis and secretion of various growth factors, including interleukin 1α, interleukin 6 (7Castelli C. Sensi M. Lupetti R. Mortarini R. Panceri P. Anichini A. Parmiani G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4785-4790PubMed Google Scholar), TGF-α (8Filmus J. Shi W. Spencer T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1017-1022PubMed Google Scholar, 9Berkowitz E.A.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The production of autocrine growth factors may therefore be a potentially significant mechanism contributing to the ability of activated Ras proteins to undermine the processes that regulate normal cell proliferation. We recently reported that mouse fibroblasts transformed by the minimal expression of activated (G12V)Ha-Ras (V12H10 cells) were unable to proliferate in serum-free medium in the presence of suramin, a growth factor antagonist (13Betsholtz C.

The constitutive MAPK activity in these cells was completely abrogated by the addition of suramin. N-Ras-transformed fibroblasts (K61N10 cells) were, however, insensitive to suramin. Biochemical analysis revealed that Raf-1 failed to interact with the activated Ha-Ras protein in the V12H10 cells, but instead, Raf-1 was found to be associated with the wild-type endogenous c-N-Ras protein. Suramin treatment disrupted the c-N-Ras·Raf-1 complex in V12H10 cells but did not disrupt the N-Ras·Raf-1 complex detected in the N-Ras-transformed K61N10 cells (15Hamilton M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The failure of oncogenic Ha-Ras to associate with Raf-1 is contrary to current dogma, which suggests that it is the direct association of an oncogenic Ras with Raf-1 that is responsible for regulating the MAPK cascade. These observations imply that the mechanism through which Ha-Ras regulates MAPK activity was through the action of an autocrine growth factor(s) rather than through a direct association with Raf-1. We sought to determine which receptor pathway activity was required to regulate MAPK activity and the serum-independent proliferation of Ha-Ras-transformed mouse fibroblasts.

V12H10 and K61N10 fibroblasts are derived from normal mouse C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts by transfection with activated (G12V)Ha-Ras and (Q61K)N-Ras constructs, respectively and are described elsewhere (15Hamilton M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All cell lines were maintained in DMEM + fetal bovine serum. EGFR-negative NR6 cells were a kind gift from Dr. T. Kung, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH. Swiss 3T3 and NR6 fibroblasts were transfected with 100 ng of pOPRSV plasmid (Stratagene) containing activated (G12V)Ha-Ras or mock transfected using the Lipofectin method (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 16 h the cells were switched to DMEM + 10%fetal bovine serum containing 500 μg/ml G418. After 10–14 days, discrete foci were identified, picked, and propagated for further analysis. Cells were seeded at 2.0–5.0 × 105 cells in 100-mm culture dishes and allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C. Adherent cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and incubated in the presence of 1 μm PD153035 or 1 μm PD158780 in serum-free DMEM for 48 h, after which they were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer. Confluent cultures of V12H10 cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and then incubated in serum-free DMEM for 48–72 h. The conditioned medium (CM) was collected and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove any nonadherent cells. CM was aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. The CM was concentrated 20–30-fold using a Centriprep 3 membrane (Amicon) with a 3000-Da cut-off. Both the CM retentate and flow-through fractions were saved and stored at −20 °C. Conditioned medium was digested for 3 h at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml Streptomyces griseusType XIV protease (Sigma), a nonspecific protease. After 3 h, fresh Type XIV protease was added, and the incubation was allowed to proceed for an additional 2 h. The protease was inactivated by heating at 100 °C for 15 min. Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold TBS, scraped, and pelleted by low speed centrifugation at 800 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200–500 μl of CHAPS lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 20 min. Insoluble cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, and the clarified lysate was transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube. The protein concentration of each sample was determined by the Bradford assay. Western blots were performed according to standard protocols. Briefly, lysates were resolved on 6 or 8% discontinuous SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with TBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (TBS + Nonidet P-40), 5% (w/v) dried skim-milk, and 1% bovine serum. The membranes were washed three times with TBS + Nonidet P-40 and incubated with the appropriate antibody in TBS + Nonidet P-40 containing 10% serum. The membranes were washed extensively with TBS + Nonidet P-40 and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBS + Nonidet P-40 containing 10% serum. The membranes were again washed extensively with TBS + Nonidet P-40, and immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold TBS, scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation at 800 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold CHAPS lysis buffer for 20 min on ice. Lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The clarified lysates were pre-absorbed with 200 μl of protein A-Sepharose (PAS) for 10 min on ice and recentrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge (PAS was prepared as a 1:4 slurry in TBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The protein concentration of the lysates was determined by the Bradford assay. 500 μg of cell lysates were incubated for 3 h with 50 μl of Ras antisera (15Hamilton M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) at 4 °C with constant rotation. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were transferred to clean Eppendorf tubes containing 400 μl of PAS and allowed to precipitate for an additional h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with ice-cold P21 + 0.1% Nonidet P-40 buffer. Laemmli buffer was added, and the immunoprecipitates were heated for 5 min at 100 °C. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted for Raf-1. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL. 400 μl of CM was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of EGFR ligand antibodies (TGF-α, HB-EGF, and EGF) or control antibodies precoupled to Protein G-Sepharose. The immunocomplexes were separated from the CM by centrifugation through a 0.45 μm Ultrafree-MC filter unit (Millipore), and the CM was tested for its ability to activate MAPK in quiescent fibroblasts. Cells were incubated for 48 h in serum-free media in the presence or absence of the following compounds: 200 μm suramin; 1 μm PD153035; 1 μm PD158780; 5 μm PD089828. Cells were stimulated for 10 min with V12H10-conditioned medium, or PDGF-BB, FGF-2, or EGF. The cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold TBS, scraped, and lysed in CHAPS lysis buffer. MAPK was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of cell lysate protein for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation using 0.5 μl of TR10 anti-MAPK serum precoupled to PAS. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with P21 + Nonidet P-40 buffer and twice with P21 buffer. 50 μl of kinase buffer (P21 buffer containing 10 μm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μm phosphatase inhibitors) containing 25 μmMBP was added to each immunoprecipitate and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The kinase reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, and the phosphorylated proteins were resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Phosphorylated MBP was visualized and quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. To determine whether Ha-Ras-transformed V12H10 cells secrete a factor that is responsible for regulating their constitutive MAPK activity, sub-confluent V12H10 cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 72 h. Parallel samples (72 h in serum-free DMEM) were collected from sub-confluent parental C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts. This CM was then tested for its ability to activate MAPK. C3H10T1/2 cells plated in 100-mm culture dishes and made quiescent by serum starvation for 48 h were stimulated with 5 ml of CM for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then scraped and lysed in 1% CHAPS buffer, and equal amounts of clarified cell lysate protein were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and processed for Western blot analysis. V12H10:CM stimulated the activation of p42 and p44 MAPK as indicated by the detection of phosphorylated p42 and p44 MAPK proteins (Fig. 1 A). These observations were supported by specifically immunoprecipitating MAPK from identical cell lysates and measuring the activity of the immunoprecipitated MAPK in a direct kinase assay (data not shown). Medium conditioned by the parental C3H10T1/2 cells did not significantly activate MAPK. Initial characterization of the MAPK-stimulating activity in CM demonstrated that it could be concentrated by centrifugation through a 3000-Da cut-off membrane, with all of the MAPK-stimulating activity remaining in the retentate fraction. The activity in V12H10:CM was titratable and could be diluted 30-fold with no significant effect upon its ability to activate MAPK (data not shown). Further biochemical analysis demonstrated that MAPK-stimulating activity could be absorbed to a heparin-Sepharose CL4B column (data not shown) and was heat-stable (100 °C for 10 min (data not shown)). Polypeptide growth factors and stimulatory lipids such as lysophosphatidic acid (16Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cook S.J. McCormick F. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) can both activate the MAPK cascade. To determine whether the MAPK-stimulating activity in the V12H10:CM was protein in nature, CM was digested for 5 h at 37 °C withS. griseus Type XIV protease followed by inactivation of the protease by heat denaturation. The ability of the protease-digested CM to stimulate MAPK was tested by challenging quiescent C3H10T1/2 cells with either naive DMEM (fresh serum-free DMEM) or protease-digested CM for 10 min at 37 °C. The effect of prolonged incubation of the CM at 37 °C upon its ability to activate MAPK was determined by incubating CM for 5 h with heat-denatured Type XIV protease. Cells were stimulated with control and protease-treated CM, lysates were prepared, and MAPK was immunoprecipitated. The activity of the immunoprecipitated MAPK was measured in a direct kinase assay using MBP as a MAPK substrate (18Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows that CM digested with Type XIV protease (CM + Pr) fails to stimulate MAPK activity, being no better at stimulating MAPK than the naive DMEM control. However, the CM incubated for 5 h with denatured protease (CM + dnPr) still possessed significant, though reduced, activity. The observation that prolonged incubation of the CM at 37 °C had a diminished ability to activate MAPK might indicate that it contains more than one polypeptide growth factor, of which one or more might be sensitive to prolonged incubation at 37 °C. However, we conclude that the MAPK-stimulating activity in V12H10:CM possesses many of the biochemical properties of polypeptide growth factors. The production of several growth factors including members of the EGF family has been associated with the expression of oncogenic Ras and can be implicated in the autocrine regulation of cell growth (8Filmus J. Shi W. Spencer T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1017-1022PubMed Google Scholar, 9Berkowitz E.A. Hissong M.A. Lee D.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1991-2002PubMed Google Scholar, 10Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M.

To investigate whether EGFR ligands may be responsible for the MAPK-stimulating activity in V12H10:CM, 400 μl of V12H10:CM was incubated overnight with antibodies to mouse EGF, HB-EGF, and TGF-α or with a control antibody. The immunocomplexes were separated from the CM by low speed centrifugation through a 0.45-μm filter. The CM was then assayed for its ability to stimulate MAPK activity by the addition of 100 μl of the immunodepleted CM to quiescent fibroblasts in 1.0 ml of serum-free medium (final concentration of CM was 0.1 ×). Cells were stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C, then scraped and lysed. MAPK was immunoprecipitated, and its activity was measured using MBP as a substrate in a direct kinase assay. CM incubated overnight either alone or with a control antibody strongly activated MAPK to an equal degree. In contrast, CM immunoprecipitated with antibodies to either EGF or TGF-α possessed a significantly reduced ability to stimulate MAPK, being slightly better than the naive DMEM control at activating MAPK. In contrast, the antibody to HB-EGF had no effect on the ability of the CM to stimulate MAPK activity (Fig. 1 C). Although these observations strongly support the conclusion that EGF and TGF-α are stimulatory factors present in the V12H10:CM, it does not exclude the possibility that additional polypeptide growth factors, including other members of the EGF family, may also be present in the CM. To determine whether the EGFR ligands present in V12H10:CM were solely responsible for stimulating MAPK activity in quiescent cells, specific pharmacological inhibitors of the EGFR were tested for their ability to block MAPK activation in response to stimulation with V12H10:CM. Confluent C3H10T1/2 cells were incubated for 48 h in 5 ml of serum-free DMEM. In parallel cultures, cells were incubated for 48 h in serum-free medium containing two highly specific inhibitors of the EGFR, PD153035 (19Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMichael A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18926-18931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and the related compound, PD158780 (1 μm each inhibitor). Both PD153035 and PD158780 are competitive inhibitors of ATP binding, effectively blocking receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Cells were then stimulated with naive DMEM, 20 ng/ml EGF, or with 1 ml of V12H10:CM for 10 min. Cell lysates were prepared, MAPK was immunoprecipitated, and its activity was measured in a direct kinase assay. After 48 h in serum-free medium, control C3H10T1/2 cells contained negligible MAPK activity. EGF and CM strongly activated MAPK in control, untreated cells. Naive DMEM did not activate MAPK. In cell cultures treated with the EGFR antagonists, both PD153035 and PD158780 completely blocked the ability of EGF and V12H10:CM to activate MAPK (Fig. 2 A), indicating that CM stimulates the MAPK cascade through its ability to activate EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. Further evidence implicating a critical role for the EGFR in regulating MAPK activity in response to CM stimulation was obtained using the EGFR-negative Swiss 3T3 cell line, NR6, which does not respond to EGF stimulation (21Pruss R.M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3918-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 22Proper J.A. Bjornson C.L. Moses H.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 110: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Quiescent Swiss 3T3 and NR6 fibroblasts stimulated with either CM or EGF were assayed for factor-dependent MAPK activation. Both CM and EGF activated MAPK in EGFR-positive Swiss 3T3 cells but failed to activate MAPK in EGFR-negative NR6 cells (Fig. 2B). Many RTKs bind and/or activate common intermediates and signaling molecules. Receptor activation results in autophosphorylation of the receptor that creates specific docking sites for the SH2 domains of several well characterized signaling molecules, including the recruitment of the RasGEF complex of Shc-Grb2-Sos (23Egan S.E.

Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar and 27van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that there was a global defect in the RTK signaling cascade, resulting in the failure of the CM to activate MAPK in NR6 cultures, NR6 cells were stimulated with either 10 ng/ml PDGF BB or 5 ng/ml FGF2 for 10 min and examined for MAPK activation. Both PDGF and FGF2 treatment resulted in MAPK activity similar to that observed with Swiss 3T3 cells, indicating that the mechanism(s) regulating RTK-dependent activation of the MAPK cascade were intact. The possibility remained that EGFR activation was mediated through unknown nonligand-dependent mechanisms. To this end, we tested the ability of V12H10:CM to stimulate MAPK activity in the presence of an antibody that blocks the ligand binding domain of the human EGFR (Ab1; Oncogene Science). We have previously observed that both mouse EGF and V12H10:CM are able to stimulate MAPK in human foreskin fibroblasts. Therefore, 2 × 105 human foreskin fibroblasts cells in 6-well plates were made quiescent by serum starvation for 48 h and incubated overnight with an excess (2.5 μg/well) of Ab1 or a nonneutralizing EGFR antibody (1005; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were stimulated with EGF or CM for 10 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared, and MAPK activity was measured as prevoiusly described. Fig. 2 C demonstrates that the neutralizing EGFR antibody, Ab1, blocks MAPK activation in response to 0.2–1 ng/ml EGF and severely abrogates MAPK activation in response to stimulation with 2.5 ng/ml EGF. Ab1 almost completely blocked all MAPK activation in response to stimulation with CM, producing a weak activation similar to that observed using control naive DMEM. In contrast, the nonneutralizing control EGFR antibody had no effect. This data suggests that CM stimulates MAPK activation through the activation of the EGFR in a ligand-dependent manner. We can therefore conclude from the data presented in Figs. 1 A through 2 C that the CM prepared from V12H10 cells contains EGFR ligands that stimulate MAPK activity in quiescent cells in a receptor-ligand-dependent manner and that the EGFR and its tyrosine kinase activity is required to activate the MAPK cascade. Furthermore, the ability of the CM to stimulate MAPK is a function of the EGFR ligands present in the CM alone. Our earlier studies using Ras-transformed cells indicated that the serum-independent proliferation of V12H10 cells was sensitive to the actions of suramin (15Hamilton M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a nonspecific growth factor antagonist (13Betsholtz C. Johnsson A. Heldin C-. H. Westermark B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6440-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 14Kehinde E.O. Terry T.R. Mistry N. Horsburgh T. Dandhu D.P. Bell P.R.F. Cancer Surv. 1995; 23: 217-234PubMed Google Scholar). This observation implied that the serum-independent proliferation of V12H10 cells was regulated by an autocrine growth factor(s). Because EGFR ligands are present in V12H10:CM, we sought to determine the importance of the EGFR in the regulation of both the constitutive MAPK activity and the serum-independent proliferation of V12H10 cells. Both Ha-Ras-transformed V12H10 cells and N-Ras-transformed K61N10 cells were incubated in serum-free medium in the presence of 1 μm PD153035 and PD158780. In addition, cells were incubated with 200 μm suramin and 10 μm PD089828 (28Dahring T.K. Lu G.H. Hamby J.M. Batley B.L. Kraker A.J. Panek R.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281: 1446-1456PubMed Google Scholar), a broad-range RTK inhibitor. After 48 h the cells were lysed, and MAPK immunoprecipitates were assayed for activity. Both suramin and PD089828 almost completely abrogated the constitutive MAPK activity in the V12H10 cells, providing strong evidence to suggest that MAPK activity in V12H10 cells is regulated in an autocrine manner. Although the exact mechanism of suramin action is not clear, PD089828 functions as a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to a wide range of receptors (PDGFR, EGFR, and FGFR), demonstrating that RTK activity is required for persistent MAPK signaling in Ha-Ras-transformed V12H10 cells. More specifically, both PD153035 and PD158780 abrogated the MAPK activity, indicating that the EGFR was responsible for regulating the constitutive MAPK activity in V12H10 cells (Fig. 3 A). In con"

The current study examined the expression of FLAP and bcl family proteins and the induction of apoptosis in interleukin-3-dependent control and bcl-x L-overexpressing FL5.12 cell lines after treatment with MK886, a specific FLAP inhibitor. FL5.12 cells contained a substantial amount of FLAP protein and mRNA but surprisingly had no measurable 5-lipoxygenase protein or 5-, 12-, or 15-lipoxygenase activity. The basal level of FLAP protein in cells overexpressingbcl-x L was 70% less than in controls. FLAP disappeared 4 h after withdrawal of interleukin-3 in bcl-x L cells but not in control cells, which underwent apoptosis. A dose- and time-response study revealed that 5 nmol of MK886/106 cells was sufficient to induce apoptosis both in control and bcl-x L cells, respectively, but to different degrees. bcl-xL and bcl-2 proteins, but not bax or FLAP, were decreased by 4 h after 5 nmol of MK886/106 cells in both cell lines, although the higher levels of bcl-xL in overexpressors took longer to disappear. This early loss of bcl-xL and bcl-2 was not attributable to generalized proteolysis, as shown by Coomassie Blue staining and by the maintenance of bax. Caspase-3 was activated 2 h after MK886 treatment in control cells but not in bcl-x L cells. Inhibition of caspase-3 decreased MK886-induced apoptosis by 50% in control cells. Inhibition of this caspase after MK886 treatment was unable to prevent the loss of bcl-xL in control cells but did provide partial protection for the loss of the transfected form, but not the endogenous form, in overexpressing cells. These data indicate that MK886 induces extensive apoptosis that is partially caspase-3 dependent and may be related to a rapid loss of bcl-xL. Although caspase-3 inhibitors had no effect on the loss of bcl-xL, other caspases or protease systems may still be involved. The absence of 5-lipoxygenase in cells containing FLAP, the lower level of FLAP in bcl-xL cells, the apoptosis-inducing activity of MK886, and the rapid loss of bcl-xL and bcl-2 proteins after treatment with MK886 strongly indicate that FLAP has activities unrelated to lipoxygenase and suggest a possible functional or regulatory link between these proteins, which share similar subcellular localizations.

Apoptosis is a highly controlled form of cell death that plays an important role in embryonic development, the maintenance of tissue and organ homeostasis, and various pathologic conditions, including cancer and xenobiotic toxicity. Several molecular entities, e.g.oncogenes, signal transducers, cell cycle proteins, and free radicals, have been associated with the induction of apoptosis (1Vaux D.L. Haecker G. Strasser A.

Free radical species are of particular interest, because they may mediate various biochemical processes leading to altered cell growth, differentiation, and death (3Sen C.K. Packer L.

Furthermore, proteins encoded by some of the bcl-2 family proto-oncogenes (e.g. bcl-2 and bcl-xL) suppress apoptosis induced by various oxidative processes (5Zhong L-T. Sarafin R. Kane D.J. Charles A.C. Mah S.P. Edwards R.H. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4533-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 6Minn A.J. Rudin C.M. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Blood. 1995; 86: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas different antioxidants are capable of preventing apoptosis spurred by a variety of agents (7Lafon C. Mathieu C. Guerrin M. Pierre O. Vidal S. Valette A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1095-1104PubMed Google Scholar, 8Um H-D. Orenstein J.M. Wahl S.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3469-3477PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the morphological and biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis induced by oxidants are not known. Reactive oxygen species and oxidized lipid products are considered crucial elements in both tumor cell proliferation (9Noguchi M. Rose D.P. Earashi M. Miyazaki I. Oncology. 1995; 52: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and apoptosis (10Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X-M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar). Different stimuli, including the activation of CD28 (11Los M. Schenk H. Hexel K. Baeuerle P.A. Dröge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3731-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and CD95 (12Wagenknecht B. Gulbins E. Lang F. Dichgans J. Weller M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) cell surface receptors, and tumor necrosis factor-α-mediated cytotoxicity (13O'Donnell V.B. Spycher S. Azzi A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) are capable of inducing apoptosis while generating reactive oxygen species and/or lipid hydroperoxides. In each case, the involvement of arachidonic acid metabolism mediated by lipoxygenase (LOX)1 was identified, indicating a possible role for LOX in regulating apoptosis and cell survival. Recently, some evidence has shown that both lipid hydroperoxides (14Sandstrom P.A. Pardi D. Tebbey P.W. Dudek R.W. Terrian D.M. Folks T.M. Buttke T.M.

Acta. 1997; 1345: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and LOX inhibitors, specific as well as nonspecific (16Avis I.M. Jett M. Boyle T. Vos M.D. Moody T. Treston A.M. Martinez A. Mulshine J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 806-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Tang D.G. Chen Y.Q. Honn K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 1997; 172: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), are capable of inducing apoptosis in some cell systems. LOX has been further related to apoptosis because of the ability of a LOX antisense oligonucleotide to cause apoptosis in W256 cells (17Tang D.G. Chen Y.Q. Honn K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5241-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In contrast to these proapoptotic effects, some LOX inhibitors blocked apoptosis in systems in which induction of LOX activity by CD95 receptor ligand (12Wagenknecht B. Gulbins E. Lang F. Dichgans J. Weller M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), hydrogen peroxide (19Maccarrone M. Catani M.V. Agrò A.F. Melino G. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), or γ radiation (20Korystov Y.N. Dobrovinskaya O.R. Shaposhnikova V.V. Eidus L.K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) occurred. The conflicting information about the effects of LOX inhibitors in apoptosis indicates that the exact mechanism(s) by which LOX affects this form of cell death is not yet understood. 5-Lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) is considered to be an integral part of the 5-LOX pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism (21Vickers P.J. J. Lipid Mediators. 1995; 12: 185-194Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). FLAP transfers arachidonic acid to 5-LOX protein, thereby enabling this enzyme to efficiently produce oxidized lipid products. Inhibition of this process can be achieved at nanomolar doses of MK886. However, at higher doses, MK886 appears to further disrupt arachidonic acid binding to FLAP, thereby altering metabolism of this fatty acid, reducing cell proliferation, and causing apoptosis (22Anderson K.M. Seed T. Jajeh A. Dudeja P. Byun T. Meng J. Ou D. Bonomi P. Harris J.E. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 2589-2600PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, FLAP is localized to the nuclear membrane (23Woods J.W. Coffey M.J. Brock T.G. Singer I.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2035-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), a site where bcl antiapoptotic proteins are also found (24Chao D.T. Linette G.P. Boise L.H. White L.S. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Alterations in LOX and FLAP expression or activity in connection with apoptosis and the role of the bcl family of oncogenes in this process have not been examined. In the current study, the effects of MK886 (Scheme FS1), a specific FLAP inhibitor, on cell survival, apoptosis, bcl-x L , bcl-2, and FLAP expression, and caspase activity in both control and bcl-x L-overexpressing murine pro-B lymphocytic FL5.12 cell lines have been investigated. The results show a much lower expression of FLAP in bcl-x L-overexpressing cells, a dramatic decrease in bcl-xL and bcl-2 proteins after treatment of cells with MK886, and activation of caspase-3 in the control cells but not bcl-x L cells treated with MK886. In addition, induction of apoptosis by withdrawing interleukin 3 (IL-3), an essential growth factor for these cells, caused the rapid loss of FLAP protein in bcl-x L-overexpressing but not control cells. These changes suggest that some link may exist between FLAP and bcl proteins. Furthermore, the fact that FLAP is present in cells lacking measurable 5-LOX suggests that this protein may have an important role in apoptosis unrelated to its effects on LOX. IL-3-dependent murine pro-B lymphocytic cell lines (FL5.12), stably transfected with either an SFFV-NEO control or an SFFV-FLAG-bcl-x Lconstruct were used in this study (25Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A. Merino R. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22764-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These cell lines were obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Gabriel Nuñez (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Briefly, both cell lines, grown in suspension culture, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Northcross, GA), 1% glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml respectively; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% (v/v) IL-3-conditioned medium in a 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere at 37 °C. IL-3-conditioned medium was obtained from the WEHI-3B cell line, grown in suspension culture under similar conditions (26Lee J.C. Hapel A.J. Ihle J.N. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 2393-2398PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were passaged on alternate days with fresh medium, and cell counts were determined with a Coulter (Miami, FL) T-890 counter. In most of the experiments, cells were treated with either ethanol (0.2% final concentration) as vehicle control or MK886 (Biomol Research, Plymouth Meeting, PA). In some experiments, cells were treated with either zVAD-FMK (50 or 200 μm) or Ac-DEVD-CHO (25 or 50 μm; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 1 h before the treatment with MK886. Cells (2 × 107) were harvested by centrifugation at 600 × g and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold relaxation buffer (27Pouliot M. McDonald P.P. Krump E. Mancini J.A. McColl S.R. Weech P.K. Borgeat P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 2500 ×g for 20 min to obtain nuclei. The remaining supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to recover cytosol. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. DNA fragmentation was measured according to the method described by Ioannou and Chen (28Ioannou Y.A. Chen F.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 992-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (6 × 106) were treated with MK886 (0.1–30 nmol/106 cells) for 2–24 h and then pelleted at 300 × g for 10 min. Cell-enriched pellets were lysed in 500 μl of buffer (pH 8.0) containing Tris-HCl (5 mm), EDTA (20 mm), and Triton X-100 (0.1% v/v). After addition of polyethylene glycol 6000 and NaCl to final concentrations of 2.5% and 1 m, respectively, samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Ice-cold 100% ethanol was added to the supernatants. After storage overnight at −20 °C, fragmented DNA was collected by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in Tris buffer (10 mm, pH 7.8) containing 0.1 mm EDTA, and the DNA was electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.2 μg/ml) at 100 V for 2 h. Apoptosis was quantitated by visualizing distinctive nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence, chromatin condensation, and formation of multiple apoptotic bodies after staining of cells with acridine orange and ethidium bromide (29Duke R.C. Cohen J.J. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeak A.M. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 3.17.1-3.17.16Google Scholar). Treated and control cells were pelleted at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then resuspended in 20 μl of fresh medium containing 4 μl of ethidium bromide/acridine orange mixture (1:1 v/v, stock solution 100 μg/ml each). This suspension (10 μl) was examined under a fluorescent microscope to differentiate early apoptotic cells from late apoptotic, normal, and necrotic cells. The number of apoptotic cells (both early and late) was counted in 10 different fields (magnification × 40) in each case. Cells (107 cells/treatment) were pelleted, lysed in 250 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and anti-protease mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 30 μl/ml aprotinin) by repeated pipetting and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and total protein content in the supernatant was measured (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Far A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatants were run on either 8% (5-LOX) or 15% (FLAP, bax, bcl-2, and bcl-xL) reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels (buffer composition: 0.2 m Tris (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocked for at least 1 h in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then incubated with anti-bcl-xL (rabbit), anti-bcl-2 (rat), or anti-bax (rabbit) monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies (1:1500 dilution each; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; Sigma), FLAP, or 5-LOX rabbit polyclonal antisera (1:1500 dilution each; generous gifts from Dr. Jilly F. Evans, Merck Institute for Therapeutic Research, Quebéc, Canada) for 1 h. The membrane was washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, anti-rabbit, anti-rat, or anti-mouse IgG (1:3000 dilution each; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), for 1 h, and the protein of interest was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The film was scanned, and individual band densities were integrated using NIH Image public domain software. bcl-x L cDNA was purified from the corresponding plasmid (a generous gift from Dr. Gabriel Nuñez) using a Qiagen (Santa Clara, CA) kit. Total cellular RNA (107 cells/treatment) was isolated using Ultraspec RNA isolation reagent (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). Isolated RNA was separated in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Zeta Probe membrane (Bio-Rad) by diffusion. A bcl-x LcDNA probe was labeled with [32P]dCTP (ICN, Irvine, CA) by the random primer method (31Feinburg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 137: 266-267Google Scholar) using a kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The membrane was hybridized in 0.25 mNa2HPO4 (pH 7.2) and 7% (w/v) SDS overnight at 65 °C. The membrane was then washed twice with 20 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 7.2) and 5% (w/v) SDS for 5 min and twice with 20 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2) and 1% (w/v) SDS for 5 min. Autoradiography was performed either electronically with a Packard Instrument Co. Instant Imager or using Eastman Kodak Co. XAR-5 film (Sigma) exposed overnight at −80 °C. Radiomatic quantitation was carried out using Packard Imaging software (version 2.02). Band densities were compared after correction against the constant level of 7 S rRNA expression. Total cellular RNA was isolated using a RNAqueous kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). 3 μg of total RNA were transcribed with 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 300 ng of oligo(dT), 1 mm dNTPs, and 10 units of placental RNase inhibitor (RETROscript kit, Ambion) in reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer, in a total volume of 20 μl at 37 °C for 1 h. PCR was performed using 1 μl of the resulting cDNA, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), reverse and forward primers (250 μm each), and 250 μm dNTP in a final volume of 50 μl. The cDNA sequences used in the amplification of FLAP were as follows: 5′ (5′-ATGGATCAAGAGGCTGTGGGC-3′) and 3′ (5′-CGTCGTGCTTACCGTTCTGAT-3′). The reaction mixture was heated to 94 °C for 3 min, and amplification was performed for 30 sequential cycles at 94 °C for 50 s, 58 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 40 s. After the last cycle, the reactions were incubated at 72 °C for an additional 5 min. 10 μl of PCR products were electrophoretically separated in a 1.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml). Cells (2 × 107) were pelleted, resuspended in 500 μl of 100 mm Tris (pH 7.8) containing 1 mm EDTA, and sonicated on ice using at least three 30-s pulses. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The disrupted cells were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with 100 μm3H-labeled arachidonic acid (10 μCi/ml; DuPont) at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was halted by adding 2 ml of methanol, and cellular protein was removed by centrifugation. The methanol layer was evaporated to dryness under vacuum, reconstituted in 200 μl of methanol, and injected into a C18 reverse-phase column (Whatman). 3H-Labeled arachidonic acid metabolites, particularly the level of different hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, were analyzed to assess cellular LOX activity (32Fair A. Pritchard K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Peaks were identified by comparison with authentic standards (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI). Cells (2 × 106) were pelleted and lysed in 300 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Aliquots (50 μl) of the lysate were incubated with tetrapeptide substrate (Ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin or Ac-YVAD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, 40 μm each), 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol in a final volume of 200 μl for 2 h at 37 °C. The fluorescence of the released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured using an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and emission wavelength of 450 nm (33Mizushima N. Koike R. Kohsaka H. Kushi Y. Hanada S. Yagita H. Miyasaka N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons between the groups were carried out using analysis of variance followed by post hoc analyses using Student-Newman-Keul's test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a nonspecific LOX inhibitor, induced apoptosis in control FL5.12 cells (Fig. 1). This occurred at low (0.5 μm, probably non-antioxidant) concentrations. Apoptotic cells were represented by ∼20% of the total cell population in the control cells 3 and 6 h after 1 μm NDGA treatment, whereas only 10–14% of bcl-x L-transfected cells underwent apoptosis, an amount comparable to untreated controls (Fig. 1). Protection was also evident in bcl-x L cells using 1 μm NDGA. NDGA is an effective nonspecific LOX inhibitor but has numerous other effects. Thus, NDGA could induce apoptosis by other mechanisms, although available data suggest its action on LOX is the critical one (18Tang D.G. Honn K.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because not all cells have LOX activity, FL5.12 cells were examined for the presence of LOX. Immunoblot analysis revealed that FL5.12 cells do not have any measurable 5-LOX protein (Fig. 2 A). The faint bands evident do not match the positive control obtained from mouse white blood cells. Confirmation of this finding was achieved using a LOX activity assay, which indicated there is no measurable 5-, 12-, or 15-LOX activity present in either the control or transfected cell lines. Based on the apparent absence of 5-LOX, the effect of caffeic acid, a specific 5-LOX inhibitor (34Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Gresser M. Young R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 383-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), was also examined. This compound was unable to induce apoptosis in FL5.12 cells, indicating that the effect of NDGA is unrelated to 5-LOX. Despite the absence of 5-LOX, both control and bcl-x L-overexpressing FL5.12 cells expressed FLAP (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, the basal level of FLAP detected in bcl-x L overexpressors was only 30% of that present in the control cells. The growth of FL5.12 cells depends on IL-3, and significant apoptosis (30%) occurs in control but not in bcl-x L cells (13%) 6 h after withdrawal of this growth factor (35Bojes H.K. Datta K. Xu J. Chin A. Simonian P. Nuñez G. Kehrer J.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The expression of FLAP was maintained at basal levels in control cells up to 8 h after withdrawal of IL-3 (Fig. 2 B). However, FLAP completely disappeared at 4 h after IL-3 withdrawal in the bcl-x L-transfected cells (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, bcl-x L expression did not change in either control or bcl-x L cells after IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 2 C). Immunoblot analyses of different subcellular fractions obtained from both control and bcl-x L cell lines indicated that FLAP was mainly present in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 2D), as has been documented previously in different cell lines (23Woods J.W. Coffey M.J. Brock T.G. Singer I.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2035-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The presence of FLAP mRNA in both control and bcl-x L cell lines was identified by RT-PCR (Fig. 2 E). Although quantitative RT-PCR was not performed, it appeared that FLAP mRNA expression in control cells was greater than that in bcl-x Loverexpressors. Mobilization of esterified arachidonic acid from membrane lipid pools has been postulated to contribute to tumorigenesis and to the progression of certain cancers by promoting cell proliferation (36Piomelli D. Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar,37Ondrey F.G. Jhun S.K. Adams G.L. Laryngoscope. 1996; 106: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because FLAP assists in arachidonic acid mobilization through its binding activity, we studied its role in apoptosis using a specific FLAP inhibitor, MK886 (21Vickers P.J. J. Lipid Mediators. 1995; 12: 185-194Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1994; 22: 13-21PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis was not evident in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells that do not contain FLAP (data not shown). However, consistent with the presence of FLAP, a dose of MK886 of as low as 5 nmol/106 cells (∼10 μm) was able to induce significant apoptosis in control FL5.12 cells at 8 h, as assessed by DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3,lanes 1–6). bcl-x L-overexpressing cells showed a degree of resistance against apoptosis at 8 h caused by the same concentration of MK886, although DNA fragmentation was clearly evident using 10 nmol/106 cells (Fig. 3, lanes 7–12). After a time-response study using 5 nmol of MK886/106cells, DNA fragmentation was first evident in control cells at 8 h. bcl-x L overexpression largely prevented DNA ladder formation by this dose of MK886 up to 24 h (data not shown). However, a quantitative analysis of apoptosis using acridine orange/ethidium bromide revealed a time-dependent increase using MK886 treatment at 5 nmol/106 cells in both cell lines, with controls significantly increased by 4 h and bcl-x L cells by 8 h (Fig. 4). Overall, bcl-x Loverexpression reduced the apoptotic cell count by ∼55% over 8–24 h compared with control cells treated with MK886. The induction of apoptosis by MK886 in bcl-x L-overexpressing cells was surprising based on the broad resistance to this form of cell death normally seen in the presence of this protein. Immunoblot data indicated that endogenous bcl-xL protein levels in control cells were reduced 35% (Fig. 5 A, lane 2) relative to untreated cells (lane 1) by 2 h after MK886 treatment (5 nmol/106 cells), decreased further by 4 h (lane 3), and disappeared at 8 h (lane 4). Similar changes in both endogenous and transfected bcl-xLprotein levels in bcl-x L overexpressors were observed after MK886 treatment. The transfected human form of bcl-x L (FLAG-bcl-x L, which is slightly smaller than the murine form and thus runs faster) was decreased 30, 40, and 75% relative to controls by 2, 4, and 8 h, respectively, after MK886 treatment (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5–8). Detectable levels of the transfected form remained even after 8 h, possibly explaining the lesser apoptosis after MK886 treatment in bcl-x L-transfected cells compared with controls. Endogenous murine bcl-xL protein was, however, completely lost by 8 h (Fig. 5 A, lane 8). Similarly, endogenousbcl-2 expression in both the cells was gradually decreased with time after MK886 treatment (Fig. 5 B). It was interesting to note that the expression of bax (Fig. 5 C) and FLAP (Fig. 5 D) proteins was unaltered 8 h after MK886 treatment compared with control in both cell lines. The rapid loss of bcl-xL protein after MK886 appeared to be unrelated to transcription, because bcl-x L mRNA in both of the cell lines was not changed with time compared with controls (data not shown). This information, and the rapidity of the change in proteins, suggested that a proteolytic mechanism might be involved. The rapid and massive induction of apoptosis by MK886 in both control and bcl-x L-transfected cells would be expected to be accompanied by a generalized proteolysis, at least at later time points. However, the early loss of bcl-xL was not attributable to a generalized loss in protein, because up to 4 h (when a significant decrease in bcl-xL protein was already evident; Fig. 5 A) only minimal changes were evident in total protein bands in Coomassie Blue-stained gels (data not shown), and bax and FLAP did not change (Fig. 5, C and D). In addition, there was no loss of bcl-xLafter induct"
https://openalex.org/W2050125437,"The Trifid nebula is a young (10 5 years) galactic HII region where several protostellar sources have been detected with the infrared space observatory. The sources are massive (17 to 60 solar masses) and are associated with molecular gas condensations at the edges or inside the nebula. They appear to be in an early evolutionary stage and may represent the most recent generation of stars in the Trifid. These sources range from dense, apparently still inactive cores to more evolved sources, undergoing violent mass ejection episodes, including a source that powers an optical jet. These observations suggest that the protostellar sources may have evolved by induced star formation in the Trifid nebula."
https://openalex.org/W2091776071,"A 69-base pair (bp) (−581/−513) fragment derived from human transcobalamin II distal promoter constructed upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene demonstrated high bidirectional promoter activity in transfected epithelial Caco-2 cells. DNase I footprinting, gel mobility shift, supershift, and mutagenesis studies with the 69-bp fragment demonstrated that a GC box (−568/−559) and an E box (−523/−528), which interacted with Sp1/Sp3 and USF1/USF2 (where USF is upstream stimulatory factor), respectively, were required for the full transcriptional activity of this fragment. Whereas mutations in the GC box reduced the promoter activity by 50%, mutations in the E box alone or in both the E box and GC box resulted in 90% loss of transcriptional activity. The essential role of the E box in the bidirectional promoter activity was further demonstrated by transient transfection in Caco-2, K-562, and HeLa cells using a 29-bp (−541/−513) fragment that contained only the E box. Based on these results we suggest that 1) the E box is essential for both the GC box-dependent and -independent promoter activity of the 69-bp fragment, 2) cooperative interactions between Sp1/Sp3 and USFs are required for the full activation of the 69-bp promoter activity, and 3) the single E box is able to mediate bidirectional transcription in transfected cells in the absence of an obvious TATA box or a known initiator element. A 69-base pair (bp) (−581/−513) fragment derived from human transcobalamin II distal promoter constructed upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene demonstrated high bidirectional promoter activity in transfected epithelial Caco-2 cells. DNase I footprinting, gel mobility shift, supershift, and mutagenesis studies with the 69-bp fragment demonstrated that a GC box (−568/−559) and an E box (−523/−528), which interacted with Sp1/Sp3 and USF1/USF2 (where USF is upstream stimulatory factor), respectively, were required for the full transcriptional activity of this fragment. Whereas mutations in the GC box reduced the promoter activity by 50%, mutations in the E box alone or in both the E box and GC box resulted in 90% loss of transcriptional activity.

Eukaryotic gene expression is controlled by a combination of effects from various cis-elements present in the promoter and enhancer regions. One such cis-element is the E box (CANNTG), which is recognized by a variety of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 transcription factors. Two types of E box, depending upon the nature of the two central nucleotides, are described (1Dang C.V. Dolde C. Gillison M.L. Kato G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Whereas the E box with the sequence CAGCTG is referred to as class A, the E box with the sequence CACGTG belongs to class B. The functions of the E box are very divergent and to a large extent dependent upon the transcription factors that bind to it. These include neurogenesis, myogenesis, sex determination, T-cell/B-cell, and pancreatic specific gene expression, as well as cell proliferation and differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 2Murre C. Brain G. van Dijk M.A. Engle I. Furnari B.A. Massai M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The selective binding mechanism by which multiple factors bind to the same target site (class A or B) is not clear. It may involve competition among the factors influenced by sequences flanking the consensus CANNTG or interactions with other proteins binding to adjacent sites (3Bendall A.J. Molloy P.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16104-16111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) we have shown that the promoter activity of human transcobalamin II (TC II), a plasma transporter of cobalamin (24Cooper B.A. Rosenblatt D.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 296-320Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar), is relatively weak and controlled positively by a distal GC box and negatively by a proximal GC/GT overlapping box. In the present study, we have identified a 69-bp sequence (−581/−513) from the distal region of the TC II promoter (25Li N. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 280: 756-764Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that did not contain an obvious TATA box or a known Inr element but possessed a high promoter activity in transfected cells in an orientation-independent manner. The bidirectional promoter activity was due to interactions between Sp1/Sp3 and USF1/USF2 that bound to GC box and E box, respectively. Furthermore, a 29-bp sequence (−541/−513) containing only the E box was sufficient by itself to mediate transcription in the absence of other cis-elements. This finding suggests that TATA−/Inr− promoters may use an E box as a core element to direct basal transcription. Promoterless plasmid, pCAT-Basic (pCAT-B) (Promega, Madison, WI), was used for the preparation of the CAT fusion reporter constructs. Various truncated TC II-promoter fragments were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inserted into the pCAT-B vector at a PstI site upstream from the CAT gene. A total of seven promoter fragments were amplified, and the sequences of each pair of primers used for PCR are shown in Table I. The DNA sequence of each of the promoter fragments was confirmed by sequencing prior to transfection. For promoter fragments CI (25-bp) and CII (29-bp), double-stranded (DS) oligonucleotides corresponding to the respective sequences (Table II) were synthesized and ligated at aPstI site in front of the CAT gene in the pCAT-B vector. In addition, fragments F2 and CII were also cloned into the pCAT-Promoter (pCAT-P)(Promega) vector at a site about 2.8 kilobase pairs upstream of the start site of the CAT gene.Table IPCR primers used in generating TCII promoter segments Open table in a new tab Table IIDNA sequence of oligonucleotides used in EMSAaA mismatched nucleotide for consensus sequence of GC box is double underlined.bMutated nucleotides are indicated by asterisks.cThe sequence indicated by the lowercase letters in the oligo-Myb contains a restriction enzyme XbaI site which is not present in the 5′-flanking reign of TCII gene.dThe E box (CACGTG) within the 14-bp palindome is underlined.

The substitution mutagenesis of the GC or E box in the promoter fragment was generated using the QuickChange Site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For each mutagenesis a pair of overlapping oligonucleotides with desired mutations was commercially synthesized, and the sequences are listed in Table II. The mutations generated were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The human colon epithelial cell line Caco-2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish the day before transfection and transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (26Grahm F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). The transfection was performed using 15 μg of promoter-CAT fusion plasmid and 5 μg of an internal control plasmid pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) for monitoring the transfection efficiency. In addition, promoterless vector pCAT-B and promoter-containing plasmid pCAT-P were also transfected in each experiment as a negative and positive control, respectively. Each transfection was carried out at least three times. After 46 h of transfection, cells were harvested, and extracts were prepared for β-galactosidase and CAT assays. β-Galactosidase activity was measured according to Herbomel et al. (27Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), and CAT activity was determined by the method of Gorman et al. (28Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar) using [14C]chloramphenicol as a substrate. The acetylated products were separated from the unacetylated products by either thin layer chromatography or liquid scintillation counting as described by Seed and Sheen (29Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). CAT activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activities for the variations of transfection efficiency. Nuclear extracts were prepared from Caco-2, HeLa, and K-562 cells essentially as described by Dignam et al. (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9154) Google Scholar). All buffers contained protease inhibitors including phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), antipain (10 μm), and benzamidine (1 mm). Protein concentration of the nuclear extract was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 112: 195-203Google Scholar). The promoter fragment C (−581/−513) was labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. DS oligonucleotide CI or CII (Table II) was labeled at the 5′ termini with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled probe (∼2 × 104 cpm) was incubated for 15 min at 22 °C with 2.2 μg of nuclear extract in 10 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC)). For competition experiments the nuclear extract was incubated with the indicated concentrations of DS oligonucleotide competitor (Table II) at 22 °C for 5 min prior to incubation with the probe. For immunosupershift assay, the nuclear extract was preincubated with 1.5 μg of affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against USF1, USF2, or c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) at 22 °C for 30 min prior to incubation with the probe. The reaction mixture was then subjected to 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer (44.5 mm Tris-HCl, 44.5 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 100 V. The protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. The coding strand of the promoter fragment C was 3′-end-labeled by [32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and gel-purified. The end-labeled probe (∼1 × 104 dpm) was incubated for 10 min on ice with 20 μg of nuclear extract in 50 μl of buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). After the incubation, 50 μl of 5 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2 solution was added to the reaction followed by digestion with 0.4–2 units of DNase I (Promega) at 22 °C for 2 min. The digestion was then terminated by adding 90 μl of stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA) and subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction. After precipitation with ethanol, the DNA pellet was resuspended in 4 μl of the loading buffer, heated at 95 °C for 2 min, and subjected to electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. A 69-bp Sequence Derived from the 5′-Region of the TC II Gene Activates Transcription in an Orientation-independent but Position-dependent Manner—Our previous 5′-deletion studies (23Li N. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16104-16111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of the TC II-promoter fragments, including the longest (−1014 to +34), is very weak in Caco-2 cells. To identify regions that may potentially have higher promoter activity, four promoter fragments (F1–F4) generated by PCR were cloned into a promoterless CAT reporter vector, pCAT-B. Upon transient transfection in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1 A), only the fragment F2-(−746/−513) possessed promoter activity above the background activity produced by the promoterless pCAT-B vector. The promoter activity of this fragment (20-fold) was nearly 2.5-fold higher than that obtained using the pCAT-P vector (8.5-fold) that contained the SV40 promoter upstream from the CAT gene. In addition, the promoter activity of the F2 fragment was orientation-independent (Fig. 1 B) as the fragment F2 in a reverse orientation (−513/−746) revealed a similar level (19-fold) of transcriptional activity. In order to identify the elements within the 234-bp fragment that were responsible for its high bidirectional transcriptional activity, this fragment was further dissected into three regions (A, B, and C) (Fig. 1 B). The 5′-terminal region A (58 bp, −746/−689), which contained an inverted CCAAT element and a potential AP2-binding site, led to a 3-fold activation of the CAT activity in both orientations, accounting for about 16% of the activity of the fragment F2. The region B (119 bp, −688/−570) which contained several potential cis-elements, such as two AP2 sites, two Myb sites, and four inverted GA or GT boxes (GGGA/TGGG), did not reveal any promoter activity in either orientation. However, the 3′-terminal region C (69 bp, −581/−513) had a high transcriptional activity (∼15-fold) in both orientations, corresponding to about 75% of promoter activity of the full-length F2 fragment. Although the fragment F2-(−746/−513) or fragment C-(−581/−513) possessed relatively high promoter activities, the activity was masked when a downstream region (−513/+183) was included (23Li N. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16104-16111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The strong reduction of the transcriptional activity could be due to either a distance effect or to the presence of a GC/GT box acting as a negative element in the downstream region (23Li N. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16104-16111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two possibilities, the fragment F2 or C was constructed into a pCAT-P vector containing the SV40 promoter at a remote position, nearly 2.8 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site of the CAT gene. As shown in Fig. 1 B, very little or no activation was observed using either of the two constructs, F2-(−581/−513)-P or C-(−581/−513)-P. These results suggested that the fragment F2 or C functioned in a distance-dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggested that the 69-bp sequence was mainly responsible for the transcriptional activity of the 234-bp fragment and that it functioned in an orientation-independent but a distance-dependent manner. Inspection of the sequence of the 69-bp region revealed a potential Myb site, a GC box with one mismatch, and two types of E box, CAGCTG (class A) and CACGTG (class B). To identify functional cis-elements in the 69-bp region, DNase I footprinting analysis was performed using nuclear extracts from Caco-2 and HeLa cells. Two protected regions, CI and CII, were revealed using both cellular nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 A). Region CI-(−578/−559) included a Myb-binding site and a previously described (23Li N. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16104-16111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) GC box, and region CII-(−532/−519) contained a 14-bp palindromic sequence with an E box (CACGTG) of class B in the center of the palindrome (Fig. 2 B). Nuclear proteins binding to the two protected regions were then examined by EMSA using nuclear extracts from Caco-2 cells and the probes covering the two regions, respectively. Two protein-DNA complexes were revealed when DS oligonucleotide CI was used as a probe (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). Both complexes were eliminated when competition was carried out using unlabeled oligonucleotide Sp1 containing the consensus sequence of the GC box (lane 3) or the wild-type oligonucleotide CI sequence (lane 4). The formation of the two complexes was not affected when the oligonucleotide CI-M which contained point mutations in the GC box (Table II) or the oligonucleotide Myb was used as competitors (lanes 5 and 6). These results indicated that the binding of the nuclear proteins in region CI occurred specifically at the GC box rather than at the Myb site. Supershift analysis using antibody against Sp1 and Sp3 has indicated that the complex I was formed by interaction with both Sp1 and Sp3, and the complex II was formed by interaction with Sp3 alone (23Li N. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16104-16111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Gel shift analysis using oligonucleotide CII as a probe also showed the formation of two complexes (Fig. 3 B). However, one of the complexes was very dominant whereas the other was very faint (lane 2). Both complexes were abolished when competed with excess of unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide CII (lane 3) but not with oligonucleotide CII-M (lane 4) in which the 14-bp palindromic sequence was mutated including the core sequence of the E box (Table II). To evaluate the role of the GC box and the E box on the promoter activity of the 69-bp region, the same mutations that eliminated nuclear protein binding (Fig. 3) were introduced into the plasmid construct C-(−581/−513). Fig. 4 shows the CAT activity of the wild-type or the mutant constructs transfected in Caco-2 cells. Mutations in the GC box resulted in about 50% loss of the CAT activity of the 69-bp fragment, whereas mutations in the E box alone or in both the GC box and the E box diminished the transcriptional activity by about 90%. These results indicated that both the GC box and the E box were required for the full transcriptional activation of the 69-bp fragment. However, the relative contributions of these two cis-elements were different. The presence of the E box was essential for the transcriptional activity contributed by the GC box but not the other way around. On the other hand, the presence of the GC box enhanced the transcriptional activity of the E box by 2-fold, suggesting that there could be functional physical interactions between the nuclear proteins that bind to the two sites. In order to test this possibility, gel-shift analysis was carried our using the 69-bp fragment containing both the GC box and the E box. When the labeled 69-bp promoter fragment was allowed to bind to the nuclear extracts from Caco-2 cells, at least five DNA-protein complexes were revealed (Fig. 5, lane 1). When competed with excess unlabeled oligonucleotide CI (lane 3) or Sp1 (lane 6) which contained the GC box, the complexes I, II, III, and IV were eliminated. When the competition was carried out using unlabeled oligonucleotide CII carrying the E box, the complexes I, II, and V disappeared (lane 4). Competition with oligonucleotide CI-M containing mutations in the GC box (lane 2) or CII-M containing mutations in the E box (lane 5) did not affect the formation of the complexes I–V. These results suggested that the formation of the complexes I and II was the result of physical interactions between nuclear proteins bound to both the GC box and the E box since both the complexes were unable to form in the presence of either unlabeled oligonucleotide CI (lane 3) or CII (lane 4). Since the 69-bp fragment containing the wild-type E box was essential for driving transcription in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 4), additional studies were carried out using a 29-bp fragment, which corresponded to the footprinting region CII containing the E box, to test whether it is able to drive transcription not only in Caco-2 cells but in other cells as well. Initially we tested by EMSA whether the 29-bp fragment is able to bind to nuclear factors in K-562 and HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 6, two DNA-protein complexes were formed when the 32P-CII fragment was incubated with nuclear extracts from either HeLa (Fig. 6 A, lane 1) or K-562 (Fig. 6 B, lane 1) cells. This pattern was similar to that obtained using nuclear extracts from Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3 B). The formation of the two complexes were eliminated when competed with excess unlabeled oligonucleotide CII (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 2–4). In contrast, the oligonucleotide CII-M was unable to compete for the formation of the two complexes (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 5–7). These results suggested that nature of the nuclear proteins binding to the 29-bp was similar or identical in all the three cell lines tested and that the binding was specific to the E box. The ability of the 29-bp fragment to drive transcription was then tested in Caco-2, HeLa, and K-562 cells. As shown in Table III, the 29-bp fragment was able to drive CAT gene transcription in both orientations in all the three cell lines tested (Table III), and the CAT activity noted, 8–11-fold, was similar to that of the SV40 promoter. Since the E box(CACGTG) can interact with multiple transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLH/LZ) family, the identity of the transcription factor binding to the E box motif was further investigated.Table IIIBidirectional promoter activity of the 29-bp DNA fragment in mammalian cellsPlasmid constructsRelative CAT activityCaco-2HeLaK-562-foldCII-S(−541/−513)-P8.5 ± 0.89.2 ± 0.611.0 ± 1.3CII-AS(−513/−541)-P8.9 ± 0.99.5 ± 1.011.6 ± 1.5The plasmid constructs were transiently transfected into cell lines indicated followed by the determination of the CAT activity.

As shown in Fig. 7 similar EMSA pattern was obtained using nuclear extract from both Caco-2 (Fig. 7 A) and HeLa (Fig. 7 B) cells. When the nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-USF1 antibody (Fig. 7, Aand B, lane 2), the complex I was diminished and the complex II was completely abolished, indicating that both complexes contained USF1. When the nuclear extract was incubated with anti-USF2 antibody (Fig. 7, A and B, lane 3), formation of the complex I was mainly interrupted. This result indicated that complex I represented a combination of both USF1 and USF2. Addition of both anti-USF1 and anti-USF2 antibodies to the nuclear extracts resulted in complete abolishment of the complex I and II (Fig. 7, A and B, lane 4). In contrast, antibody against c-Myc did not affect the formation of the two complexes (Fig. 7, A and B, lane 5). The present study has provided some insights into the basal and activator-dependent transcription using a human TC II promoter fragment that lacked both a TATA box and an Inr element. By deletion and transient transfection studies, we have demonstrated that a 69-bp DNA sequence from the human TC II promoter possesses bidirectional promoter activity but not an enhancer activity (Fig. 1 B, fragment C). The 69-bp fragment did not contain an obvious TATA box or a known Inr element but contained a GC box with one mismatch and a 14-bp palindromic sequence (TGCTCACGTGACCA) with an E box (underlined) in its center. These observations raised an interesting issue as to how the 69-bp DNA fragment without a TATA box and Inr element functioned as a promoter. Our EMSA experiment (Fig. 3) has shown that both the GC box and the E box were functional in binding to nuclear factors, and immunosupershift analysis further demonstrated that the GC box interacted with Sp1 and Sp3 (Fig. 3, Ref. 23Li N. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16104-16111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas the E box was recognized by both USF1 and USF2 (Fig. 7). Site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 4) demonstrated that both the GC and the E box were required for the full promoter activity of the 69-bp fragment. However, their individual contribution toward the promoter activity was not equivalent. Mutations in the GC box reduced the promoter activity by 50%, whereas mutations in the E box alone or in both the E box and the GC box resulted in about 90% reduction of the promoter activity. These results implied that the E box was required for both the GC-dependent and -independent promoter activity of the 69-bp fragment, and there was potential cooperative interactions between nuclear factors that bound to these two cis-elements. Direct evidence for physical interactions between Sp1 or Sp3 and USFs was provided by EMSA (Fig. 5). The essential role of the E box in mediating transcription was further demonstrated by transfection of the fusion plasmid containing the DS oligonucleotide II (29-bp) which contained only the E box in three different cell lines (Table III). The observation that a short (29-bp) DNA fragment containing only one recognizable cis-element, an E box, is sufficient to direct bidirectional transcription efficiently is very interesting. In general, a eukaryotic core promoter contains either a TATA box or an Inr element that are recognized by the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a component of the TFIID complex, and Inr-binding protein, respectively. TBP or Inr-binding protein plays a central role in recruiting basal transcription factors and RNA polymerase II forming a preinitiation complex (PIC). However, there are a few reports that have demonstrated that an activator-binding site alone is sufficient for a minimal promoter activity in transfected cells. These include the glucocorticoid response element (34Schatt M.D. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and the Ets motif (35Carter R.S. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4381-4387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bottinger E.P. Shelly C.S. Farokhzad O.C. Arnaout M.A. Mol. Cell.

The mechanism by which the 29-bp sequence functions as a minimal promoter is not known. It is possible that USF bound to the E box stabilized the binding of TFIID to a cryptic TATA element through protein-protein interactions. Alternatively or additionally, USF bound to the E box can recruit TFIID and/or other components of the basal transcription machinery to the promoter and facilitate the assembly of the PIC. Several lines of evidence support this possibility. First, it has been reported (38Singer V.L. Wobbe R. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 39Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13850-13859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) that TBP is capable of binding to a number of sequences that are completely unrelated to the consensus sequence of the TATA element. Second, USF has been shown to be able to interact with TFIID (12Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 40Sawadogo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11994-12001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), increase the rate or stability of TFIID binding (41Bungert J. Kober I. During F. Seifart K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 885-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and stabilize formation of the PIC (42Carcomo J. Lobos S. Merino A. Buckbinder L. Weinmann R. Natarajan V. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7704-7714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, USF is also able to interact with other transcription factors, including TBP associated factor TAFII55 (43Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), transcriptional cofactor PC5 (44Halle J.-P. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Meisterernst M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21307-21311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and TFII-I (45Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar,46Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) which can bind to both the Inr and the E box. Another interesting aspect of this study is the distinct roles of the E box and the GC box in the transcriptional activity of the 69-bp sequence. Although the presence of the E box was essential for the transcriptional activity due to the GC box, the presence of the GC box was not required for the transcriptional activity due to the E box. This observation implied that USF mainly played a role in transcriptional initiation while the Sp1 stimulated the transcription. This observation is somewhat surprising since it has been shown (47Kollmar R. Sukow K.A. Sponagle S.K. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2252-2257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Lu J. Lee W. Jiang C. Keller E.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9296-9301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before that Sp1-binding site could direct transcriptional initiation of several TATA-less promoters. Our finding that USF-binding site was more efficient than that of Sp1-binding site in mediating transcriptional initiation could be a general phenomenon or restricted to a specific context of a promoter or cells. Nevertheless, our finding is in agreement with the hypothesis (50Kirschbaum B. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5094-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that USF1 may not directly be responsible for transactivation but functions via interactions with other proteins. In this regard, it is interesting to note that USF1 does not only bind to the E box but also to the pyrimidine-rich Inr element (45Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 46Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopically expressed USF1 could stimulate transcription initiation through Inr element (46Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the E box functions similarly to that of the Inr element if it is located near the transcriptional start site. Our finding that both the 69-bp (Fig. 1 B) and the 29-bp sequence (data not shown) mediated transcription in a position-dependent manner also supports a recruiting rather than an activating function of the USF bound to the E box. Indeed, USF-binding site near the transcriptional start site has been found being essential for the basal promoter activity of some TATA-less promoters (15Outram S.V. Owen M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26525-26530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ikeda K. Inoue S. Orimo A. Sano M. Watanabe T. Tsutsumi K. Muramatsu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1997; 240: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The functional significance of the role of the E box in TC II transcription is not known. Although the binding of USF to the E box may not affect the basal transcription of TC II in vivo due to its distal location from the start sites of the TC II gene, the potential binding in vivo of other members of bHLH/LZ family cannot be ruled out. Some of these could include Myc/Max, Mad/Max, and Max/Max. Elevation of plasma TC II levels is noted in a variety of cancers (51Jacob E. Baker S.J. Herbert T. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 918-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and our hypothesis at the present time is that the E box by binding to Myc family may increase the transcription of the TC II gene which in turn will result in increased secretion of TC II to the circulation. Future studies with ectopic expression of the proteins belonging to the Myc family will address the role of these transcription factors in the in vivo transcription of the TC II gene. In summary, we have identified a 69-bp DNA fragment containing a GC box and E box that is able to mediate transcription in vivo in an orientation-independent manner. The transcriptional activity was due to interplay between Sp1/Sp3 and USF1/USF2 that bind to these two cis-elements. Moreover, 29-bp fragment localized to the 3′-end of the 69-bp fragment containing only the E box was sufficient by itself to drive transcription, implying that USF bound to an E box can initiate and activate transcription in the absence of TATA box or other known Inr elements."

R., Brugnara, C., Byers, H. R., Gattoni-Celli, S., and Halperin, J. A. (1995) Nature Med. 1, 534–540). The action of CLT is thought to involve depletion of intracellular Ca2+stores but the underlying mechanism has not been defined. The present study utilized membrane vesicles of rabbit cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to determine the mechanism by which CLT depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores. The results revealed a strong, concentration-dependent inhibitory action of CLT on the ATP-energized Ca2+ uptake activity of SR (50% inhibition with ∼35 μm CLT). The inhibition was of rapid onset (manifested in <15 s), and was accompanied by a 7-fold decrease in the apparent affinity of the SR Ca2+-ATPase for Ca2+ and a minor decrement in the enzyme's apparent affinity toward ATP. Exposure of SR to CLT in the absence or presence of Ca2+ resulted in irreversible inhibition of Ca2+ uptake demonstrating that the Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free conformations of the Ca2+-ATPase are CLT-sensitive. Introduction of CLT to the reaction medium subsequent to induction of enzyme turnover with Ca2+ and ATP resulted in instantaneous cessation of Ca2+ transport indicating that an intermediate enzyme species generated during turnover undergoes rapid inactivation by CLT. The inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by CLT was accompanied by inhibition of Ca2+-stimulated ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+-induced phosphoenzyme intermediate formation from ATP in the ATPase catalytic cycle. Phosphorylation of the Ca2+-deprived enzyme with Pi in the reverse direction of catalytic cycle and Ca2+ release from Ca2+-preloaded SR vesicles were unaffected by CLT. It is concluded that CLT depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores by inhibiting Ca2+ sequestration by the Ca2+-ATPase. The mechanism of ATPase inhibition involves a drug-induced alteration in the Ca2+-binding site(s) resulting in paralysis of the enzyme's catalytic and ion transport cycle. CLT (50 μm) caused marked depression of contractile function in isolated perfused, electrically paced rabbit heart preparations. The contractile function recovered gradually following withdrawal of CLT from the perfusate indicating the existence of mechanisms in the intact cell to inactivate, metabolize, or clear CLT from its target site.

Clotrimazole (CLT)1 is an antimycotic imidazole derivative widely used for the treatment of yeast infections and its fungistatic action has been attributed to the inhibition of sterol 14α-demethylase, a microsomal cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme (1Vanden Bossche H. Willemsens G. Cools W. Marichal P. Lauwers W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1983; 11: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 2Yoshida Y. Aoyama Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Imidazole antimycotics have also been shown to be potent inhibitors of many mammalian cytochrome P-450-mediated reactions (3Ayub M. Levell J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 31: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Ballard S.A. Lodola A. Tarbit M.H. Biochem.

Recently, CLT has been shown to have a remarkable ability to inhibit the proliferation of normal and cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo (6Benzaquen L.R. Brugnara C. Byers H.R. Gattoni-Celli S. Halperin J.A. Nature Med. 1995; 1: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the potential of this drug as a new tool in the treatment of proliferative disorders is now being explored. Evidence from mechanistic studies indicates that the growth-blocking property of CLT may arise from its ability to interfere with cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Thus, it has been shown that CLT depletes intracellular Ca2+stores in 3T3 cells (6Benzaquen L.R. Brugnara C. Byers H.R. Gattoni-Celli S. Halperin J.A. Nature Med. 1995; 1: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), inhibits voltage- and ligand- stimulated Ca2+ influx mechanisms in GH3 cells, chromaffin cells, and thymocytes (7Villalobos C. Fonteriz R. Lopez M. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2742-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Alvarez J. Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Biochem.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11789-11793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Brugnara C. Armsby C.C. Sakamoto M. Rifai N. Alper S.L. Platt O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 273: 266-272PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of CLT on Ca2+ influx and Ca2+-activated K+channels may be secondary to the drug-induced depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (6Benzaquen L.R. Brugnara C. Byers H.R. Gattoni-Celli S. Halperin J.A. Nature Med. 1995; 1: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It has not been clarified whether the CLT-induced depletion of intracellular Ca2+stores is due to activation of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores or due to inhibition of reuptake of Ca2+ back into intracellular stores. In muscle cells, the intracellular membrane system of SR plays a central role in the storage and release of Ca2+ during the contraction-relaxation cycle. Upon myocyte excitation, Ca2+is released from the SR through the ryanodine receptor-Ca2+release channel to initiate muscle contraction (11Fleischer S. Inui M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 12Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J.

Subsequent muscle relaxation occurs upon sequestration of Ca2+ back into the SR lumen by an SR-associated Ca2+-pumping ATPase (14Feher J.J. Fabiato A. Langer G.A. Calcium and the Heart. Raven Press Ltd., New York1990: 199-268Google Scholar, 15Inesi G. Submilla C. Kirtley M.E. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Lytton J. MacLennan D.H.

Acta. 1997; 1318: 52-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). During the translocation of Ca2+ across the SR membrane, Ca2+-ATPase serves as an energy transducer and a carrier for Ca2+ (15Inesi G. Submilla C. Kirtley M.E. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Fozzard H.A. Haber E. Jennings R.B. Katz A.M. Morgan H.E. The Heart and Cardiovascular System. 2nd Ed.

The mechanism of Ca2+ transport by the SR Ca2+-ATPase is recognized to involve cyclic transitions between two major conformational states, E 1 and E 2 (15Inesi G. Submilla C. Kirtley M.E. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Fozzard H.A. Haber E. Jennings R.B. Katz A.M. Morgan H.E. The Heart and Cardiovascular System. 2nd Ed.

These two states differ in that the affinity for Ca2+ is high in the E 1conformation and low in the E 2 conformation, and in that the Ca2+-binding sites are exposed to the cytoplasmic side of SR in E 1 but to the luminal side of SR in E 2. The catalytic and ion transport cycle begins with the binding of 2 mol of Ca2+ions followed by 1 mol of Mg2+-ATP to theE 1 form of the ATPase. An aspartic acid residue (Asp351) in the active site is then phosphorylated by the terminal phosphate of ATP forming an acylphosphate. Phosphorylation of the enzyme results in a conformational change in theE 1PCa2+ phosphoenzyme intermediate to the E 2PCa2+ form which has decreased Ca2+ affinity. The Ca2+-binding sites are now everted so that they face the SR lumen to which Ca2+ is subsequently released. The Mg2+-catalyzed hydrolysis of E 2P devoid of bound Ca2+ ions results in the release of Pi into the cytoplasm leaving E 2which isomerizes to E 1 to complete the cycle. The Ca2+-ATPase reaction mechanism is thought to be similar for different isoforms of this enzyme expressed in muscle and non-muscle tissues (18Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given its robust Ca2+ cycling properties, the SR membrane provides an excellent model system to investigate the mechanisms by which CLT depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores. Here we present the results from studies using rabbit cardiac SR demonstrating a strong inhibitory action of CLT on the Ca2+ ion transporting as well as energy transducing functions of the Ca2+-ATPase. On the other hand, CLT was found to have no effect on Ca2+ release from Ca2+-preloaded SR vesicles. In isolated perfused beating rabbit hearts, infusion of CLT resulted in marked depression of contractile function. 45CaCl2 and [32P]Na2PO4 were purchased from New England Nuclear (Montreal, PQ, Canada), and [γ-32P]ATP from Amersham (Oakville, ON, Canada). CLT was from Sigma. All other chemicals were from Sigma or BDH Chemicals (Toronto, ON, Canada). SR membrane vesicles were prepared from heart ventricles of New Zealand White rabbits (body weight 2.5–3 kg) as described previously (19Sulakhe P.V. Narayanan N. Biochem. J. 1978; 261: 171-180Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Following isolation, the SR vesicles were suspended in 10 mm Tris maleate (pH 6.8) containing 100 mm KCl and stored at −80 °C after quick-freezing in liquid N2. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. ATP-dependent, oxalate-facilitated Ca2+ uptake by SR was determined using the Millipore filtration technique as described previously (21Narayanan N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 678: 442-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The standard incubation medium for Ca2+ uptake (total volume 250 μl) contained 50 mm Tris maleate (pH 6.8), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm NaN3, 120 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm potassium oxalate, 5 mm ATP, 0.1 mm45CaCl2 (∼8000 cpm/nmol; free Ca2+, 10.6 μm), and SR (7.5 μg of protein). In experiments where Ca2+ concentration dependence was studied, the EGTA concentration in the assay medium was held constant at 0.1 mm and the amount of total45CaCl2 added was varied in the range 1 to 280 μm to yield the desired free Ca2+. Modifications to the standard incubation medium are specified in figure legends. Unless indicated otherwise, all assays were carried out at 37 °C; the Ca2+ transport reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP after preincubation of the rest of the assay components for 3 min. The initial free Ca2+ concentrations in the assay medium were determined using the computer program of Fabiato (22Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The data on Ca2+ concentration dependence on Ca2+ uptake were analyzed by nonlinear regression curve fitting using SigmaPlot scientific graph program (Jandel Scientific) run on an IBM-PC computer. The data were fitted to the equation,v=VmaxCa2+n/K0.5n+Ca2+n,(Eq. 1) where v is the measured Ca2+ uptake activity at a given Ca2+ concentration,V max is the maximum activity reached,K 0.5 is the Ca2+ concentration giving half of V max, and n is the equivalent to the Hill coefficient. Ca2+-ATPase activity of SR membranes was quantified as described previously (23Narayanan N. Newland M. Neudorf D. Biochim. Biophys.

In one series of experiments, Ca2+-ATPase assays were performed using an incubation medium identical to that used for Ca2+ uptake, except that [γ-32P]ATP was used instead of nonradioactive ATP and nonradioactive CaCl2was used instead of 45CaCl2. Parallel assays were also performed in the absence of Ca2+ (i.e.in the presence of 0.2 mm EGTA with no CaCl2added to the assay medium) and the Ca2+-ATPase activity (designated “Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity” under “Results”) was defined as the difference in ATP hydrolysis (liberation of 32Pi) measured in the absence and presence of Ca2+. In another series of experiments, Ca2+-ATPase assays were performed using an incubation medium similar to that described above but with the exception that potassium oxalate was omitted and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (dissolved in ethanol, final concentration of ethanol in assay = 1%) was added to give a final concentration of 3 μm. These assays were performed in the absence and presence of TG. When present, the concentration of TG in the assay medium was 0.1 μm. 2Under the standard Ca2+ uptake assay conditions employed in this study, 0.1 μm TG was found to produce complete inhibition of Ca2+ sequestration by the SR. In these experiments, the TG-inhibitable ATP hydrolysis was defined as the Ca2+-ATPase activity (designated “TG-sensitive Ca2+-ATPase activity” under “Results”). In both series of experiments, the ATPase reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP after preincubation of the rest of the assay components for 3 min at 37 °C, and was allowed to proceed for 3 min. Unless indicated otherwise, the Ca2+ uptake and ATPase assays in the presence of CLT were performed by adding the drug during preincubation. CLT and TG were dissolved in Me2SO and control tubes contained an equivalent volume of Me2SO vehicle; the final concentration of Me2SO did not exceed 5%. Steady-state levels of Ca2+-induced phosphoenzyme were measured using [γ-32P] ATP as described previously (24Narayanan N. Su N. Bedard P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (total volume 200 μl) contained 50 mm Tris maleate (pH 6.8), 1 mm MgCl2, 120 mm KCl, 25 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and SR (50 μg of protein). The Ca2+ dependence of phosphoenzyme formation was monitored in parallel assays in the absence of Ca2+ and in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP following preincubation of the rest of the assay mixture for 3 min at 23 °C. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 s and was stopped by adding 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm ATP and 2 mm KH2PO4. The phosphoenzyme was quantified by Millipore filtration and liquid scintillation counting (24Narayanan N. Su N. Bedard P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of SR Ca2+-ATPase with Pi was performed as described previously (25Hawkins C. Xu A. Narayanan N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (total volume 200 μl) contained 50 mm Tris maleate (pH 6.8), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% Me2SO, 4 mm[32P]Na2PO4 and SR (50 μg). The reaction, initiated by the addition of [32P]phosphate following preincubation of the rest of the assay mixture at 23 °C for 3 min, was allowed to proceed for 30 s and was quenched with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 4 mmNa2HPO4. The acid-denatured protein was recovered by centrifugation, the pellets were washed with 0.2 mm Na2HPO4, digested in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the 32P radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. 45Ca2+ release rates from SR vesicles passively loaded with 45CaCl2 were determined by Millipore filtration (25Hawkins C. Xu A. Narayanan N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Passive45Ca2+ loading was performed by incubating SR vesicles (1 mg of protein/ml) at 23 °C for 40 min in a medium containing 50 mm Tris maleate (pH 6.8), 120 mmKCl, 1 mm45CaCl2, and 1 mm potassium oxalate. To initiate Ca2+ release, aliquots of the 45Ca2+-loaded vesicles were diluted into a Ca2+ release medium (50 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.8, containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EGTA) that was preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Subsequently aliquots of the incubation mixture were filtered through Millipore filters at 30-s intervals for a period of 5 min. The filters were washed with 3 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Tris maleate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 120 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 10 μm ruthenium red, dried at 60 °C, and 45Ca2+ radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Rabbits were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitol (35 mg/kg, intravenous), the hearts were excised and immediately cannulated for retrograde aortic perfusion of the coronary arteries with mammalian Ringer solution consisting of 154 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 6 mmNaHCO3, and 5.5 mm dextrose. The perfusion buffer was equilibrated with 95% O2,5% CO2, which maintained a pH of 7.4; the perfusion temperature was set at 37 ± 0.2 °C. The hearts were perfused at a constant flow rate of 25 ml/min using a peristaltic pump. After an initial 15–20 min of perfusion, when the spontaneous beating had stabilized, the atria were removed and the hearts were paced electrically at a rate of 120 beats/min with a Grass SD9 stimulator via a platinum wire electrode inserted into the epicardium, at double threshold voltage and a duration of 5 ms. A latex balloon-tipped cannula filled with degassed H2O was inserted into the lumen of the left ventricle for obtaining systolic left ventricular pressure (LVP) development. The cannula was connected via a pressure transducer (COBE, Bramalea, Canada) to a BioPac System Digital Monitor (model MP100) and a personal computer which allowed on-line monitoring of LVP and off-line calculation of developed pressure, rate of pressure development (+dP/dt), and rate of relaxation (−dP/dt). Unless specified otherwise, the experimental values represent the average of at least three independent experiments using separate SR preparations performed in duplicate. The data are presented as mean ± S.E. The ATP-dependent, oxalate-facilitated Ca2+ uptake by SR vesicles is a useful, commonly used parameter to measure the Ca2+-pump (Ca2+-ATPase) function of SR in vitro (15Inesi G. Submilla C. Kirtley M.E. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the time course of ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by cardiac SR vesicles measured in the absence of CLT and in the presence of three selected concentrations of CLT. The rates of Ca2+ uptake by SR was strongly inhibited in the presence of CLT; the degree of inhibition increased with increasing concentration of CLT. In the experiments shown in Fig. 2 A, the ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake was determined in the absence of CLT and in the presence of varying concentrations of CLT (16–120 μm); the amount of SR in the assay medium was constant at 30 μg of protein/ml (i.e. 7.5 μg of protein/250 μl of assay medium, see “Experimental Procedures”). It is seen that CLT inhibited Ca2+ uptake strongly and in a concentration-dependent manner. Under these conditions, 50% inhibition of Ca2+ uptake was observed at ∼35 μm CLT; nearly complete inhibition of Ca2+uptake occurred at CLT concentrations of 80–120 μm. The results presented in Fig. 2 B demonstrate the influence of SR protein concentration in the assay medium on the inhibitory action of CLT on Ca2+ uptake by SR. In these experiments, the SR protein concentration in the assay medium was varied from 0.02 to 0.32 mg/ml and Ca2+ uptake was measured in the absence of CLT and in the presence of two selected concentrations of CLT (32 and 64 μm). It can be seen that at a given concentration of CLT, increasing the concentration of SR in the reaction mixture leads to progressively less inhibition of Ca2+ uptake. This relationship is more pronounced at the low (32 μm) CLT concentration. Thus, the CLT concentration dependence of Ca2+ uptake inhibition is an apparent function of the concentration of SR protein in the reaction mixture. It should be noted, however, that half-maximal inhibition of Ca2+ uptake required a large stoichiometric excess of CLT over Ca2+-ATPase in the assay medium. For example, since the Ca2+-ATPase constituted about 10% of the membrane protein in the cardiac SR preparations used, 3Densitometric scanning of cardiac SR proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the band corresponding to the Ca2+-ATPase accounted for about 10% of the total protein. Analysis of the number of Ca2+-ATPase catalytic units/protein weight unit based on steady state levels of EP (Fig. 7) gave a value of ∼4%. The lower value based on EP measurements is to be expected since only one-half of the total enzyme molecules seem to undergo phosphorylation (Ref. 40Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6232-6237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and reports cited therein). it could be estimated that 32 and 64 μm CLT produced 50% inhibition of Ca2+ uptake in the presence of ∼75 and 200 nmCa2+-ATPase, respectively, in the assay medium (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the CLT concentration dependence of Ca2+ uptake inhibition does not reflect a strict stoichiometric relationship of the inhibitor and Ca2+-ATPase (see “Discussion”). Since CLT inhibited ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by SR, the effect of CLT on Ca2+-ATPase activity (ATP hydrolysis) of SR was investigated. Incubation of SR vesicles with varying concentrations of CLT (16–120 μm) under the assay conditions identical to that used for Ca2+ uptake led to concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity (Fig. 3 A). This inhibition of ATPase activity occurred at the same concentration range of CLT required for inhibition of Ca2+ uptake (cf. Fig. 2 A). Therefore the observed reduction of Ca2+uptake is a consequence of a primary inhibition of ATPase activity by CLT. The Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity of SR measured in the absence of CLT in these experiments (Fig. 3 A), however, exceeded the Ca2+ uptake activity determined under identical assay conditions (Fig. 2 A). This excess ATP hydrolysis is apparently due to uncoupling of ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ transport prevailing in the isolated SR vesicles and/or contribution of other ATPase(s) unrelated to the Ca2+-pumping ATPase. In order to examine the specific effect of CLT on the SR Ca2+-pumping ATPase, additional experiments were performed where TG (0.1 μm)-sensitive Ca2+-ATPase activity of SR was determined in the absence of CLT and in the presence of varying concentrations of CLT. Also, the assays were performed in the absence of oxalate and in the presence of a Ca2+ ionophore (A23187, 3 μm) in the assay medium which permitted linear rates of ATP hydrolysis. The results showed concentration-dependent inhibition of TG-sensitive ATPase activity by CLT (Fig. 3 B). The concentration of CLT required for half-maximal inhibition of TG-sensitive Ca2+-ATPase activity (∼36 μm, Fig. 3 B) and Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity (∼30 μm, Fig. 3 A) was found to be essentially similar. The TG-sensitive ATPase activity measured in the absence of CLT and in the presence of ionophore (Fig. 3 B) was about 4-fold higher than the Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity measured in the absence of ionophore and in the presence of oxalate (Fig. 3 A). Such difference in enzyme activity is likely due to stimulation of the SR Ca2+-ATPase by the ionophore (26Sulakhe S.J. Sulakhe P.V. Gen. Pharmacol. 1979; 10: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,27Narayanan N. Jones D.L. Xu A. Yu J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1032-C1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4Measurement of TG (0.1 μm)-sensitive ATPase activity in the absence of ionophore and presence of oxalate in the assay medium (i.e. under the standard Ca2+ uptake assay conditions employed in this study) gave a value of 720 ± 75 nmol of Pi/mg of protein/3 min which is not significantly different from the Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity measured in the absence of CLT (cf. Fig. 3 A). Therefore, the “Ca2+-stimulated” and “TG-sensitive” ATPase activities measured likely represent the enzymatic function of the same SR Ca2+-ATPase. At a submaximally effective concentration of CLT (32 μm), inhibition of TG-sensitive Ca2+-ATPase activity was observed at varying Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 3 B, inset). The inhibitory effect of CLT on Ca2+-ATPase activity was associated with decrements in maximal velocity (V max (nmol of Pi/mg of protein/3 min): control, 2491 ± 62; +32 μm CLT, 1573 ± 31) as well as the enzyme's apparent affinity for Ca2+(K 0.5 for Ca2+ (μm): control, 0.8 ± 0.06; +32 μm CLT, 2.8 ± 0.10). The results presented in Fig. 4 show the effect of two selected concentrations of CLT (32 or 64 μm) on Ca2+uptake by SR at a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations (9 nm- 71 μm). CLT inhibited Ca2+uptake at all Ca2+ concentrations tested. With a submaximally effective concentration of CLT (32 μm), the inhibitory effect could not be overcome with increasing Ca2+ concentration. The kinetic parameters derived from the data shown in Fig. 4 are summarized in Table I. It can be seen that the inhibitory action of CLT is associated with decrements in the apparent affinity of the Ca2+-ATPase for Ca2+, Hill coefficient (n H) for Ca2+, as well asV max of Ca2+ transport.Table IEffects of CLT on the kinetic parameters of Ca2+ uptake by SRParameterControl32 μm CLT64 μm CLTV max, nmol of Ca2+·mg of protein−1·min−1208 ± 5.7112 ± 6.653 ± 7.7K 0.5for Ca2+ (μm)1.16 ± 0.167.4 ± 1.66.2 ± 2.1Hill coefficient (n H)1.6 ± 0.280.78 ± 0.070.7 ± 0.1The kinetic parameters were derived from the data shown in Fig. 4 using the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab The kinetic parameters were derived from the data shown in Fig. 4 using the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” When Ca2+ uptake assays were performed in the presence of various ATP concentrations, CLT inhibition was found to be independent of ATP concentration (Fig. 5). Approximately 60% decrease in the V max of Ca2+ uptake was observed in the presence of 32 μm CLT (V max (nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein/min): control, 120; +32 μmCLT, 50). This inhibitory action of CLT also appeared to involve a modest decrease in the apparent affinity of the Ca2+-ATPase for ATP (K 0.5 for ATP (mM): control, 0.11; +32 μm CLT, 0.20). To investigate the effect of CLT on Ca2+-ATPase during its turnover, CLT was added to the Ca2+ uptake assay medium 90 s after initiating Ca2+-ATPase tur"

In this study, we determined the amino acid sequence of the S. mansoni SMA2 Ca2+-ATPase. We used a yeast expression system to determine whether Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity was associated with the expression of SMA2. The results indicate that the S. mansoni Ca2+ pump is present in yeast intracellular membranes and shows kinetic properties and inhibitor sensitivities comparable to those of other SERCA isoforms. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the PMR1and PMC1 genes encode for Ca2+-ATPases located in the Golgi system and the vacuole, respectively (16Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol.

An adult worm cDNA library constructed in λgt10 was screened by hybridization to the 0.86-kb PCR product SmII (12de Mendonça R.L. Beck E. Rumjanek F.D. Goffeau A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 72: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Five positive phage plaques were isolated and their cDNA insert subcloned as an EcoRI fragment into the pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) plasmid. The nucleotide sequence of the insert from plasmids 2A1 and 1A1 was determined by the dideoxynucleotide method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52653) Google Scholar), using synthetic oligonucleotides and a set of enzymatically deleted cDNA fragments. Sequence analysis of the encoded polypeptide showed that an approximately 0.6-kb fragment of the complete SMA2 cDNA was lacking from the 5′-terminus. The cDNA library was therefore rescreened using the 1-kbEcoRI-BamHI fragment of the 2A1 clone as a radiolabeled probe. Candidates were analyzed by a PCR-based method (25Hamilton B.A. Palazzolo M.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1951-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using the following oligonucleotides: 5041 (5′-TGGTCGCTTAGTTTTACCGTTTTC-3′), which is complementary to the 3′ end of the λgt10 left arm, 5042 (5′-GAGGTGGCTTATGAGTATTTC-3′), which is complementary to the 5′ end of the λgt10 right arm, and 2A1P (5′-TTTTTAGCAGCCATTCT-3′), which is located 200 bp downstream of the 5′ end of 2A1. Only one selected clone (3B1) contained a 3370-bp cDNA sequence identical to that of the 2A1 and 1A1 clones, except for a missing deoxythymidylic acid nucleotide at position 1606 in 3B1. A full-length SMA2cDNA (cSMA2) was reconstructed by standard cloning techniques. First, the BamHI-BamHI fragment of plasmid 2A1 (the latter site from vector sequence) and theBamHI-EcoRI fragment of plasmid 1A1 were ligated together into pSK(+) as a BamHI-EcoRI fragment, yielding plasmid 2A1ABE. Then, a 1.2-kb fragment containing a 5′-engineered PstI restriction site close to the start AUG codon of SMA2 as well as an deoxyadenylic acid nucleotide at position −3 relative to the AUG codon was PCR-amplified using clone 3B1 as a template and oligonucleotides 5ATGPCR (5′-GCCACTGCAGCAAAATGGAAACAGCATTTTCG-3′) and 2A1OL1 (5′-AAGTGATGCACTTCTGG-3′). The PCR product was cut with PstI and HaeII and added to theHaeII-HindIII fragment of the 2A1ABE plasmid, and both fragments were cloned together intoPstI-plus-HindIII-cut pSK(+), yielding plasmid pSKSMA2. The 3.2-kb PstI-HindIII fragment of pSKSMA2 plasmid that contains cSMA2 was used to replace the plantPMA2 cDNA cloned under the control of the promoter of the PMA1 gene (PPMA1) in the low copy number (Cen)LEU2-marked cp(PMA1)pma2 plasmid (26de Kerkove d'Exaerde A.

The resulting SMA2 expression plasmid was named p315SMA2. Plasmid p426SMA2 is the high copy number (2μ), URA3-marked pRS426 vector (27Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar) containing the PPMA1::cSMA2 insert from p315SMA2. The p315SMA2 and p426SMA2 plasmids lacking cSMA2are referred to as p315C and p426C, respectively. To construct the vcx1::Kan R null allele, the Kan R gene from plasmid pFA6a-kanMX6 (28Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR, using two 60-mer oligonucleotides that correspond to the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the VCX1gene, respectively (positions −49 and +1223) (20Cunningham K.W. Fink R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Yeast genomic DNA preparation and plasmid and phage DNA purification were carried out as described (29Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston E. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Janssen K.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR reactions were performed using the TaqI (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and PwoI (Boehringer Mannheim) DNA polymerases. All PCR products and DNA junctions obtained through successive cloning steps were sequenced to rule out unexpected mutations. Total RNA from yeast cells and S. mansoni adults worms was prepared following the procedures described in Refs. 31Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L.

Total RNA was resolved by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a N+-Hybond (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) nylon membrane by capillary transfer (32Knight M. Simpson A.J.G. Parayes G. Chaudri M. Smithers S.R. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and hybridized to cSMA2 that had been labeled by nick translation as described by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.). Equal amount of total RNA was loaded onto the gel as indicated by methylene blue staining of ribosomal RNAs. The various membrane fractions analyzed in this study were prepared by differential centrifugation as described in Ref. 33Goffeau A. Dufour J.-P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar with some modifications. Yeast cells were grown to the middle exponential (40–50 × 106 cells/ml) phase in 1000 ml of minimal medium at 30 °C. The cells (10 g) were washed twice with cold water and then resuspended in 15 ml of 250 mm sorbitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg/ml protease inhibitors. After cell disruption with glass beads, lysates were centrifuged twice at 1500 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris and then at 5000 × g for 5 min to give the P5/5 pellet. The S5/5 supernatant fraction was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 40 min to obtain a crude membrane fraction, called P15/40, and a supernatant fraction that was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h to yield the high speed membrane fraction P100/60. In some cases, the 15,000 ×g/40-min centrifugation step was skipped to recover all membrane proteins, with only a slight decrease in specific SMA2 ATPase activity. The Ptot pellet fraction, which was obtained after centrifugation of the S5/5 supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h, consisted of intracellular and plasma membranes as well as polysomes. Membrane pellets were resuspended in 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmimidazole, pH 7.5, and stored at −70 °C. For subcellular fractionation experiments, Ptot membranes (10 mg of protein) were loaded onto a linear 20–60% sucrose gradient and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. Gradients were fractionated from the top to bottom, manually, in 1-ml aliquots (fractions 1–15) that were stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or BCA (Sigma procedure, TPRO562) method, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Ptot membranes (16 mg of protein) from the Ptot fraction were solubilized in 4 ml of buffer A (100 mm KCl, 100 μm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.5) containing 0.1% (w/v) asolectin and 0.32% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. After agitation for 30 min at 4 °C, the membrane suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to remove the unsolubilized membranes. The resulting membrane extract was concentrated by filtration through an Amicon membrane with a cutoff of 50,000 Da and applied to a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with buffer B (100 μmCaCl2, 0.032% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 0.01% (w/v) asolectin, 100 mm HEPES, 100 mm PIPES, pH 7.2), and 0.5-ml fractions were collected and stored at −70 °C. Proteins were incubated 15 min at 56 °C in sample buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% dithiothreitol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue) and separated on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. When required, proteins were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10% and centrifuged for 20 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge before resuspension in sample buffer. After electrophoresis, proteins were electrotransferred onto a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using the Bio-Rad blot system filled with 24.6 mm Tris, 1.56 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The filter was saturated in Tris-buffered saline (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 3% (w/v) low fat dried milk and 0.5% (w/v) Tween 80 for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated in Tris-buffered saline containing polyclonal antibodies against rabbit SERCA1a (35Enouf J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2665-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) at 1:5000, 1:6500, and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively. Antigen-antibody complexes were revealed with 125I-labeled protein A or by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Boehringer Mannheim) using secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. Band intensity was quantified using Molecular Analyst®(Bio-Rad) or Image Master (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) softwares. SMA2-dependent ATPase activity was assayed in 10 mm HEPES/PIPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MgATP, 100 μm CaCl2, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 mm KNO3 and 2.5 mmNaN3. Samples were pre-incubated 5 min at 30 °C before the addition of 5 μl of 25 mm MgATP, pH 7.0. After 2, 4, 6, and 8 min at 30 °C, 20-μl aliquots were withdrawn and the reaction was stopped by 0.32% (w/v) NH4-molybdate in 1.14n H2SO4. Inorganic phosphate was measured at 630 nm using the method described in Ref. 38Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar. SMA2-dependent ATPase activity was calculated from the difference between the slopes obtained in the absence or presence of 40 μm thapsigargin. Stock solution of thapsigargin was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide, which at the highest concentrations used (4.8% (v/v) in the assay) had no effect on ATPase activity. For measurements of apparent K m for MgATP and V max, ATPase activity was determined in 50 mm MES/Tris, pH 7.0, using an ATP regenerating system and MgATP concentrations ranging from 0 to 3.5 mm. Free Mg2+ concentrations were kept at 2.5 mm as described (39Wach A. Ahlers J. Gräber P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In experiments involving inhibitors (vanadate, erythrosine B, cyclopiazonic acid), ATP concentration was kept constant at 1 mm MgATP. Measurements of pH optimum were made in 50 mm MES, 50 mm MOPS, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm MgATP, 2.5 mm sodium azide, 50 mm KNO3, adjusted to the indicated pH with HCl or KOH. To determine the effects of calcium concentrations on ATPase activity, the reaction mixture also contained EGTA. Free Ca2+ concentrations was calculated from stability constants for CaEGTA and MgEGTA complexes (40Sillén L.G. Martell A.E. Stability Constants of Metal-Ion Complexes. 2nd Ed. The Chemical Society, 1964Google Scholar, 41Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity was measured at pH 6.0 (33Goffeau A. Dufour J.-P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) after a pre-incubation of 5 min at 30 °C in the absence of ATP. Mitochondrial ATPase activity was assayed in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, 500 μm vanadate, 50 mm KNO3, in the absence or presence of 10 mm sodium azide. The nucleotide sequence was edited using the DNASTAR Software (Lasergene). Homology searches were done using the BLAST program (42Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70635) Google Scholar) implemented at NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Amino acid alignments and identity levels were performed using the Pile Up and Bestfit programs (GCG software version 8.0, Genetics Computer Group) available on the Belgian EMBnet Node (BEN). Triton X-100,n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate kinase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim; Na2ATP, lysolecithin, bovine serum albumin, thapsigargin, cyclosporin A, protease inhibitors and cyclopiazonic acid from Sigma; Tween 80 from Merck; erythrosine B from Janssen Chemica;125I-protein A from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Asolectin (95% purified soy phosphatides) was provided by Associated Concentrates (Woodside, Long Island, NY). All other reagents were of analytical grade. A cDNA library of S. mansoni adult worms was screened by DNA hybridization to the PCR product SmII (12de Mendonça R.L. Beck E. Rumjanek F.D. Goffeau A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 72: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) which codes for an internal sequence of SMA2 (for S . m ansoni ATPase2). DNA sequencing analysis of independently isolated clones (clones 2A1 and 1A1 in Fig. 1 A) revealed a 5′-truncated open reading frame highly homologous to rabbit SERCA isoforms. The 1-kbEcoRI-BamHI fragment of clone 2A1 was then used to reprobe the S. mansoni cDNA library (see “Experimental Procedures”), resulting in the isolation of clone 3B1 that contains the entire SMA2 coding region (Fig. 1 A). The full-lengthSMA2 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 3033 bp. The 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions are 126 and 989 bp long, respectively. No poly(A) addition site could be identified in the 3′-untranslated region. Northen blot analysis of total RNA extracted from S. mansoni adult worms revealed a unique 4.3-kb band (Fig. 1 B, lane 1), consistent with the size predicted from the sequence of the isolated SMA2 cDNA clones. The SMA2 transcript seems not to be subject to alternative splicing control. The SMA2cDNA encodes a 111-kDa polypeptide which shares 70% overall identity with the S. mansoni SMA1 isoform (12de Mendonça R.L. Beck E. Rumjanek F.D. Goffeau A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 72: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Most amino acid differences are located in the N- and C-terminal regions as well as the region flanking the fluorescein isothiocyanate binding site. Regions typically conserved in the P-type family of transport ATPases (8Moller J.V. Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) are found in SMA2 (Fig. 2). These encompass the hydrophilic head protruding into the cytosol and containing the phosphorylation and ATP-binding domains (43Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13038-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the fluorescein isothiocyanate binding site (44Filoteo A.G. Gorski J.P. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6526-6530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the smaller cytosolic loop located in the N-terminal region, the hinge motif (45Brandl C.J. Green N.M., S. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), and the membrane-spanning segments M1–10 (46Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The M4–6 and M8 transmembrane segments contain amino acids crucial for high affinity Ca2+ binding (47Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) (double underlined residues in Fig. 2). A close examination of these regions revealed that SMA2 is more related to Ca2+-ATPases than other P-type ATPases. In particular, the Glu-771 residue in the M5 region of SERCA1a, which is only found in SERCA isoforms, is also conserved in SMA2. The M1 transmembrane segment of SMA2 contains the Lys-Ile-Leu-Leu-Met pentapeptide (residues 63–67), which is identical to the putative sarco/endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (Lys/Arg-Ile-Leu-Leu-Leu) found in SERCA ATPases (48Magyar A. Varadi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This region has been shown to target chimeras of SERCA and plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps to the endoplasmic reticulum of animal Cos cells (49Foletti D. Guerini D. Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 670-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In common with the non-muscle SERCA3 isoform, SMA2 lacks the phospholamban-binding region (50Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2809-2815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C terminus of SMA2 also lacks the calmodulin-binding domain found in plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (51James P. Maeda M. Fischer R. Verma A.K. Krebs J. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2905-2910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When full-length sequences are aligned, SMA2 shows 72–74% identity toArtemia franciscana Ca2+-ATPase (52Palmero I. Sastre L. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and mammalian SERCA isoforms, 52% identity to Trypanosoma brucei endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, TBA1 (53Revelard P. Pays E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and less than 37% to human plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (54Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Stanford D.R.

To obtain further insights into the molecular basis of this inhibition, a number of 2Apro variants were generated and expressed in COS-1 cells. The effect of these variants on cellular translation, on vaccinia virus-specific translation, and on transcription of the reporter gene luciferase was analyzed. The ability of the different 2Apro variants to block cellular translation depends on their capacities to cleave eIF-4G. The blockade exerted by 2Apro on transcription of the luciferase gene reinforces the notion that this protease is a potent inhibitor of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Some of the 2Apro variants tested failed to block luciferase transcription, despite the fact that eIF-4G cleavage and inhibition of translation were observed. Two reconstituted polioviruses mutated in 2Apro were defective in inhibiting luciferase transcription, yet were still able to cleave eIF-4G and block translation. These findings indicate that 2Apro interferes with cellular gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Moreover, these two effects probably reflect the inactivation of different host proteins by poliovirus 2Apro. Transient expression of poliovirus 2Apro in mammalian cells by means of the recombinant vaccinia virus vT7 expression system leads to drastic inhibition of both cellular and vaccinia virus gene expression (Aldabe, R., Feduchi, E., Novoa, I., and Carrasco, L.

Infection of susceptible cells by poliovirus, a representative member of the Picornaviridae family, induces drastic alterations in cellular metabolism and morphology. Thus, RNA synthesis by the three cellular RNA polymerases, as well as mRNA translation, are severely impaired soon after poliovirus infection of cultured fibroblasts (1Crawford N. Fire A. Samuels M.

The availability of the poliovirus genome as cDNA permitted the identification of gene products responsible for these phenomena. A number of studies have focused on the action of two poliovirus proteases, 2Apro and 3Cpro, on cellular macromolecular synthesis. The finding that 2Apro bisected initiation factor eIF-4G1suggested that this protease is responsible for the inhibition of cellular mRNA translation (3Etchison D. Milburn S.C. Edery I. Sonenberg N.

Therefore, it is possible that, in addition to the bisection of eIF-4G, some other event contributes to the complete shut-off of ongoing translation after poliovirus infection (10Bonneau A.M. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Perez L. Carrasco L. Virology. 1992; 189: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Translation of poliovirus RNA escapes this inhibition because picornavirus RNA utilizes the COOH-terminal moiety of eIF-4G bound to eIF-4A, instead of an intact eIF-4F complex (15Lamphear B.J.

Poliovirus 3Cpro has been linked to the inhibition of cellular transcription by RNA polymerases II and III after proteolytic inactivation of several components of the cellular transcriptional machinery. Thus, purified 3Cpro cleaves and inactivates a subunit of transcription factor IID, the TATA-binding protein (TBP), and the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) (18Clark M.E. Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Dasgupta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1232-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Yalamanchili P. Harris K. Wimmer E. Dasgupta A. J.

Likewise, cleavage of transcription factor IIC subunit by poliovirus 3Cpro leading to the shut-off of RNA polymerase III transcription in vitro has been documented (21Clark M. Hämemerle T. Wimmer E. Dasgupta A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2941-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Shen Y.H. Igo M. Yalamanchili P. Berk A.J. Dasgupta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4163-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the relevance of these cleavages for the inhibition of cellular transcription by poliovirus infection remains to be established. In addition to 3Cpro, transient expression of poliovirus 2Apro in COS-1 cells also blocks transcription of a reporter gene by RNA polymerase II (23Sun X.H. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2143-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Davies M.V. Pelletier J. Meerovitch K. Sonenberg N. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14714-14720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, in vitro cleavage of TBP by recombinant poliovirus 2Aprohas been documented, although the functional significance of this event remains obscure (25Yalamanchili P. Banerjee R. Dasgupta A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6881-6886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility that 2Aprointerferes with cellular gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels is an attractive suggestion. Poliovirus 2Apro is a small cysteine protease that exhibits homology to trypsin-like proteases (26Dougherty W.G. Semler B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 781-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2Apro cleaves at two different Tyr-Gly bonds present in the poliovirus polyprotein. The first cleavage occurs in cis, while the polyprotein is still being synthesized on polysomes, separating the precursor of structural protein P1 from 2Apro itself (27Toyoda H. Nicklin M.J. Murray M.G. Anderson C.W. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Wimmer E. Cell. 1986; 45: 761-770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The second 2Apro-mediated cleavage is less efficient and occurs on the 3CDpro precursor to generate two alternative products, 3C′ and 3D′, of still unknown function (28Lee C.K. Wimmer E. Virology. 1988; 166: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Ventoso I. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6280-6288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic triad of 2Apro is formed by His-20, Asp-38, and Cys-109. Some mutations in this catalytic triad, particularly in Cys-109, render the protease fully inactive, while other mutations outside this triad generate a 2Apro still active in cis, but incapable of bisecting eIF-4G (30Hellen C.U.T. Fäcke M. Kräusslich H. Lee C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4226-4231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yu S.F. Lloyd R.E.

In addition to the functioning of 2Apro in poliovirus polyprotein processing and cytotoxicity, 2Apro has been implicated in other steps of the poliovirus replicative cycle, such as enhancement of poliovirus mRNA translation and participation in the RNA replication apparatus, and as a determinant of the mouse neurovirulent phenotype (29Ventoso I. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6280-6288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hambidge S.J. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10272-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 34Macadam A.J. Ferguson G. Fleming T. Stone D.M. Almond J.W. Minor P.D.

It is remarkable that a protein as small as 2Apro (only 149 amino acids) carries out multiple functions during the virus life cycle, perhaps reflecting a common strategy followed by viruses to condense their genetic information. Recently, we reported that transient expression of poliovirus 2Apro in mammalian cells using recombinant vaccinia virus (vT7), efficiently cleaves eIF-4G, leading to a drastic reduction of both cellular and viral translation (37Aldabe R. Feduchi E. Novoa I. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 38Aldabe R. Feduchi E. Novoa I. Carrasco L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 928-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To obtain further insight into the molecular mechanism of this inhibition, a number of 2Apro variants were generated and expressed in COS-1 cells. The proteolytic activities of these mutants on eIF-4G and their effects on cellular and vaccinia virus translation, as well as their action on transcription and translation of a reporter gene, were tested. Our present results indicate that 2Apro blocks gene expression at both transcriptional and translational levels. COS and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum. Stably transfected HeLa cells (clone X1/5) carrying the luciferase gene under the human cytomegalovirus promotor EI(PhCMV) and the tetracycline-controlled operator was generously provided by H. Bujard (Heidelberg, Germany) (39Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). These cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum in the presence of 0.02 μg/ml tetracycline until the induction. To this end, tetracycline was removed and the luciferase activity was measured 6 h later. Recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the T7 RNA polymerase (vT7) was amplified in HeLa cells growing in DMEM supplemented with 2% newborn calf serum. Poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney strain) was obtained and used as described previously (29Ventoso I. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6280-6288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Poliovirus mutants bearing substitutions in 2Apro, named as M3 (SS6F), M6 (D135N), and M7 (V119M) were obtained as described previously (40Barco A. Ventoso I. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12683-12691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All the plasmids were amplified in Escherichia coli DH5α according to standard procedures (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.R. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes, Klenow fragment, mung bean nuclease, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and RNasin were from Promega. pSVL-Luc plasmid was constructed by inserting aBamHI fragment encompassing the entire coding region of the firefly luciferase gene into plasmid pSVL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) digested with the same enzyme. pKS-Luc plasmid was constructed by inserting the BamHI fragment mentioned above into Bluescript KS vector (Stratagene). In this case, the luciferase gene is under the control of T7 RNA polymerase promotor and is induced after infection with vT7 virus. Deletion mutants were obtained from pTM1–2A vector using restriction enzymes that cleave within the 2Apro gene as follows. For pTM12A Δ1–22, pTM1–2A vector was partially digested with MscI and completely digested with SalI. The fragment of 0.385 kb, which results from a single cleavage of MscI at position 3447, was isolated from the agarose gel and ligated with pTM1 vector previously digested with SmaI and SalI. The resulting 2Apro lacks the 22 NH2-terminal amino acids. For pTM12A Δ66–79, pTM1–2A plasmid was fully digested with NdeI enzyme and partially digested with XbaI. The DNA fragment of 5.8 kb was isolated from the agarose gel, treated with Klenow fragment, and religated. The resulting 2Apro gene contains an internal deletion of 30 codons. For pTM1–2A Δ101–146, pTM1–2A vector was partially digested with MscI, and the fragment of 5.8 kb,resulting from a single cleavage of MscI at position 3682, was isolated from the agarose gel. Then, the plasmid was digested withNcoI, incubated with Klenow enzyme, and religated. The resulting 2Apro contains a carboxyl-terminal deletion of 45 amino acids. For pTM1–2A Δ118–147, pTM1–2A plasmid was digested with DraIII enzyme and the resulting 3′ protruding ends were removed by treatment with mung bean nuclease. This plasmid was digested with PstI enzyme and the resulting 0.31-kbp DNA fragment was isolated from the agarose gel. Additionally, pTM1–2A was digested withNcoI and treated with mung bean nuclease to remove its 5′ protruding extreme and digested with PstI enzyme. The resulting vector was isolated and ligated to the 0.31-kbp DNA fragment mentioned above. The resulting 2Apro contains a carboxyl-terminal deletion of 30 amino acids. Mutant 2A-1, which contains a leucine inserted at position 103 of 2Apro, was obtained by subcloning a 0.137-kbp NcoI-fragment obtained from plasmid pHF121pXA (generously given by N. Sonenberg, McGill University, Canada) into plasmid pTM12A previously digested withNcoI. Point mutations Y88S, Y88P, and Y88F in 2Apro have been described previously (29Ventoso I. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6280-6288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants N18K, A22T, L39F, C55Y, G60R, S66F, G100N, G110S, V119M, G121E, A125V, G126D, S134L, and D135N were obtained by random mutagenesis and genetic selection in yeast as indicated (40Barco A. Ventoso I. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12683-12691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells growing in 24-well dishes at 70% confluence were infected with vT7 virus at 5 pfu/cell in DMEM without serum. Twenty minutes later, the cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the indicated plasmid using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (37Aldabe R. Feduchi E. Novoa I. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Depending on cell confluence, the percentage of transfected cells varied from 70% to 90%, as judged by eIF-4G cleavage. At 16 h after transfection, the cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (25 μCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h, recovered in lysis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (29Ventoso I. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6280-6288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses were carried out as described previously using the ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit antisera against eIFG-4G or anti-3Cpro proteins were used at 1:1000 dilutions. To analyze transcription of the luciferase gene, 1.5 × 106 COS cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmids (pSVL-Luc or pKS-Luc) and 3 μg of effector plasmid (pTM12A or its 2Apro variants) using Lipofectin in medium without serum. After 12 h, expression of 2Apro was induced by infection with vT7 at 5 pfu/cell. The cells were also treated with 40 μg/ml AraC to prevent the replication of vaccinia virus DNA. Twenty hours later (32 h after transfection), cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cytoplasmic extracts were collected in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.65% Nonidet P-40). An aliquot of 20 μl was taken to measure luciferase activity of each sample (42Wet J.R. de Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar), and the remainder was used for isolation of cytoplasmic RNA as described (43Favaloro J. Treisman R. Kamen R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 718-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). The RNA pellets were dissolved in buffer P (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 60 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2 and 2 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol) and treated with 20 units of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) for 1 h at 37 °C. The RNA solutions were extracted three times with phenol and once with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The RNA was precipitated with two volumes of ethanol at −20 °C. Finally, RNA concentration was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm and by agarose gel electrophoresis. To detect specific transcripts derived from the luciferase gene, retrotranscription and subsequent PCR amplification were performed (RT-PCR). To this end, 1 μg of total RNA from each sample were heated at 90 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm1,4-dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm spermidine in the presence of 2 μm reverse primer (3′LUC: CCGCAATATTTGGACTTTCCGCCC) and cooled slowly to 42 °C. Ten units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), 0.5 mm dNTPs, and 4 units of RNasin (Promega) were added, and the reactions were incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. One half of the reaction volume was used for amplification of a 0.5-kb fragment by PCR using the 3′ LUC primer, and the internal primer encompassing nucleotides 2811–2830 of luciferase gene (5′ LUC primer:GGCGTTAATCAGAGAGGCGA). Finally, the amplified fragments were separated in a 0.8% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The intensities of the DNA bands were quantified by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics 300A computing densitometer. In some cases, it was not possible to visualize directly the amplified products after agarose gel electrophoresis. In these cases, the nucleic acids were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with a specific biotinylated riboprobe against luciferase gene as described previously (29Ventoso I. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6280-6288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of 2Apro using the vT7 system in COS-1 cells induces a marked inhibition of cellular translation (37Aldabe R. Feduchi E. Novoa I. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To analyze this effect in more detail, the 2Apro variants depicted in Fig. 1 were generated and cloned in pTM1 plasmid as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The pTM1-based expression system provides a high level of expression at only a few hours after transfection and infection of COS-1 cells with VT7. 2Apro mutants with deletions at the amino terminus (Δ1–22), at the carboxyl terminus (Δ101–146; Δ124–146), as well as internally (Δ66–97) were generated. In addition, 17 point mutations in 2Apro were obtained, some of them by site-directed mutagenesis (Y88S, Y88P, and Y88L) and the rest using a recently described genetic system to select cytotoxic-deficient 2Apro mutants in yeast cells (40Barco A. Ventoso I. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12683-12691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mutant 2A-1 contains a leucine insertion at position 103 as described (44Bernstein H.D. Sonenberg N. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2913-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Two questions were addressed with this collection of 2Apro variants. 1) Is there a correlation between eIF-4G cleavage and the blockade of protein synthesis? 2) To what extent are transcription and translation differentially affected, particularly by the 2Apro variants deficient in cleavage of eIF-4G? Infection of COS-1 cells with vaccinia virus (vT7) inhibits the translation of cellular mRNA (45Schnierle B.S. Moss B. Virology. 1992; 188 (-): 931-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, if cells are treated with AraC after infection, the replication of vaccinia virus is blocked and cellular translation continues at substantial levels (60–80% of control) for several hours. Consequently, the use of AraC offers the possibility to test the action of poliovirus 2Apro on cellular protein synthesis in cells infected with vT7 and transfected with pTM1–2Apro. Initially, pTM1 constructs bearing the different 2Aprovariants were transfected, infected with VT7, and treated with 40 μg/ml AraC. After 16 h of incubation, protein synthesis was estimated by [35S]methionine labeling of transfected COS-1 cells. An aliquot of each sample was immunoreacted with anti-eIF-4G antibodies. Expression of wt poliovirus 2Aproreduced cellular protein synthesis by 80% as estimated by densitometric quantitation of actin synthesis (Fig. 2). Analysis of eIF-4G cleavage in these cells shows that most of this factor has been degraded, although 10–20% of eIF-4G remains intact, most probably corresponding to untransfected cells. Notably, the level of expression was very variable for the different 2Apro mutants. In general there is an inverse correlation between 2Apro synthesis and the capacity to block protein synthesis and to cleave eIF-4G. For most of the variants, the major protein synthesized by transfected cells corresponds to 2Apro. The 2Apro deletion mutants tested were devoid of eIF-4G cleavage activity and did not significantly affect protein synthesis. The Δ1–22 and Δ66–97 variants were synthesized at very low levels, and they were detectable only after prolonged gel exposures. At present we do not know the reason for this low expression, but one possibility is that these proteins are very unstable and are rapidly degraded. The 2Apro with point mutations cleaved eIF-4G to varying degrees. Some variants such as A22T, L39F, S66F, Y88S, Y88P, Y88F, G110S, V119M, G126D, and D135N hydrolyzed eIF-4G and blocked protein synthesis at levels comparable to wt 2Apro. However, other variants such as N18K, G60R, and G121E showed weak proteolytic activity on eIF-4G and did not significantly reduce cellular translation. Particularly striking is the G121E variant, which synthesizes 2Apro at very high levels and yet cellular translation is not affected. G121E together with N18K are the least efficient variants as regards eIF-4G cleavage. Interestingly, mutant 2A-1, which was described as devoid of eIF-4G cleavage activity, showed significant proteolytic activity on this factor when assayed by the vT7 transient expression system. This apparent discrepancy may reflect the different systems used to detect eIF-4G cleavage. Poliovirus 2Apro is very toxic for vaccinia virus, such that it was impossible to obtain recombinant vaccinia viruses bearing the 2Apro gene (46Turner P.C. Young D.C. Flanegan J.B. Moyer R.W. Virology. 1989; 173: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar,47Jewell J.E. Ball L.A. Rueckert R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1388-1393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further work analyzing the action of this protease on vaccinia virus gene expression indicated that 2Apro profoundly interferes with vaccinia virus replication, such that no viral protein synthesis is detected at late times of infection (48Feduchi E. Aldabe R. Novoa I. Carrasco L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, the action of the different 2Apro variants described above was tested on vaccinia virus late translation. An aliquot was taken to assay the extent of eIF-4G cleavage in order to estimate the percentage of transfected cells. The experiment was carried out as indicated in Fig. 2, but AraC was omitted. The percentage of transfection achieved was about 95% as judged by eIF-4G cleavage induced by wt 2Apro (Fig. 3 B). This result is consistent with the level of translation inhibition obtained, which was above 90% (Fig. 3, A and C). The higher inhibition of vaccinia virus protein synthesis obtained as compared with the experiment shown in Fig. 2 may correspond in part to a more efficient transfection. The point mutants that showed less inhibitory potency on vaccinia virus translation (Fig. 3 A), such as G60R, N18K, C55Y, and G121E, left more eIF-4G uncleaved (Fig. 3 B). However, with other 2Apro variants there is not an evident correlation between eIF-4G cleavage and inhibition of late viral protein synthesis. For instance, this is the case for the N18K variant, which reduces viral translation by 75–80%, leaving part of eIF-4G uncleaved. This inhibition of translation may be explained by the fact that vaccinia virus late translation requires the synthesis of early and intermediate proteins. Therefore, it may be that even partial cleavage of eIF-4G interferes with viral protein synthesis at earlier times of infection, amplifying the inhibition of late viral translation. Alternatively, it is possible that poliovirus 2Apro blocks an as yet unidentified vaccinia virus function unrelated to eIF-4G cleavage, which may lead to inhibition of late translation. This possibility agrees well with the toxicity of poliovirus 2Apro for vaccinia virus (46Turner P.C. Young D.C. Flanegan J.B. Moyer R.W. Virology. 1989; 173: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 47Jewell J.E. Ball L.A. Rueckert R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1388-1393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pioneering work of Davies et al. (24Davies M.V. Pelletier J. Meerovitch K. Sonenberg N. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14714-14720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the action of poliovirus 2Apro in different steps of gene expression showed that 2Apro inhibited the transcription of a reporter gene more potently than its translation. However, it remains unclear whether this effect of 2Apro on transcription reflects a specific inactivation of a component of the cellular transcriptional machinery or if transcription is affected indirectly by the inhibition of protein synthesis provoked by 2Ap"

Rev. 1996; 9: 148-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, they are also found in the hospital environment, e.g. on the skin of patients and staff (3Seifert H. Dijkshoorn L. Gerner-Smidt P. Pelzer N. Tjernberg I. Vaneechoutte M. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1997; 35: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and some species have been recognized as dangerous nosocomial human pathogens that cause different diseases like pneumonia, meningitis, wound infections, septicemia, or endocarditis (4Levi I. Rubinstein E. Bergogne-Bérézin E. Joly-Guillou M.L. Towner K.J. Acinetobacter: Microbiology, Epidemiology, Infections, Management. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996: 101-115Google Scholar). Hospital strains appear to possess a significant capacity to survive on equipment and human skin for a long time. Moreover, in most cases they are multi-resistant against the major groups of antibiotics (2Bergogne-Bérézin E. Towner K.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 9: 148-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization, Acinetobacter is presently classified into 21 DNA groups (also called genomic species), 7 of which have been named to date, together with a number of un-grouped strains (5Dijkshoorn L. Bergogne-Bérézin E. Joly-Guillou M.L. Towner K.J. Acinetobacter: Microbiology, Epidemiology, Infections, Management. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996: 37-69Google Scholar, 6Ehrenstein B. Bernards A.T. Dijkshoorn L. Gerner-Smidt P. Towner K.J. Bouvet P.J.M. Daschner F. Grundmann H. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1996; 34: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of these 21 DNA groups, Acinetobacter baumannii is the main species associated with nosocomial infections, and most often resistant to antibiotics (2Bergogne-Bérézin E. Towner K.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 9: 148-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In common with other Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacterpossess lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 in the outer membrane of their cell wall; these LPSs represent chemotaxonomical and antigenic markers. In early investigations, it had been shown that this LPS is of the rough type, i.e. does not possess an O-specific polysaccharide (7Kawahara K. Brade H. Rietschel E.T. Zähringer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 8Brade H. Galanos C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our further investigations of LPS from several hundred Acinetobacter strains using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver stain seem to confirm this; however, when these samples were Western blotted using polyclonal rabbit antisera against LPS, most samples gave a banding pattern characteristic for smooth LPS (9Vinogradov E.V. Pantophlet R. Dijkshoorn L. Brade L. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 602-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the meantime, we and others (Ref. 10Haseley S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar and references therein) have determined several structures of O-specific polysaccharides from variousAcinetobacter genomic species, and we have further shown that rabbit antisera raised against a given LPS react highly specifically. It is still not fully understood whyAcinetobacter S-form LPS cannot be stained using silver nitrate in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In general, the core region and lipid A represent a common structural unit occurring in all LPS; thus they are thought to be important for viability and membrane function of Gram-negative bacteria (11Holst O. Endotoxin in Health and Disease.in: Morrison D.C. Brade H. Opal S. Vogel S. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Compared with the O-specific polysaccharide structures, the structural variability is more restricted within LPS from one genus. All core regions that have been investigated so far possess at least one residue of 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid (Kdo) which links the core region to the lipid A. This Kdo residue may be substituted at O-4 by a second α-linked Kdo or an α-2→4-linked Kdo disaccharide (e.g. in LPS from Salmonella orEscherichia coli), and, in most cases that have been analyzed, it is elongated at O-5 with the rest of the core region, either via a manno-configured heptose or (in heptose-deficient cores) a hexose residue. Unique structures were identified in the core region of chlamydial LPS where either the trisaccharide Kdoα2→8Kdo2→4Kdo (in Chlamydia trachomatis) or the tetrasaccharide Kdoα2→8(Kdoα2→4)Kdoα2→4Kdo (in Chlamydia psittaci) is present and no substitution at O-5 of any of the Kdo residues occurs (12Holst O. Brade H. Carbohydrates in Europe. 1998; 21: 30-35Google Scholar). The branched Kdo tetrasaccharide has to date been the largest Kdo oligosaccharide identified. The biosynthesis of lipid A and the inner core region has been investigated in detail in E. coli, and it has been found that the first two Kdo residues are transferred by a single Kdo transferase which is thus bifunctional (13Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9988-9997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for the chlamydial Kdo transferases which transfer either three (in C. trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae) or four (in C. psittaci) Kdo residues (12Holst O. Brade H. Carbohydrates in Europe. 1998; 21: 30-35Google Scholar). Although these Kdo transferases are multifunctional enzymes, their primary structures have little similarity. In a recent investigation, the Kdo transferase genes from different strains of A. baumannii and Acinetobacter haemolyticus have been characterized (14Bode C.E. Brabetz W. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In in vitro assays it was shown that each of these enzymes transfers up to three Kdo residues to a synthetic lipid A precursor from E. coli, establishing their trifunctionality. We have investigated the structure of the carbohydrate backbone of LPS from A. baumannii strain NCTC 10303 (ATCC 17904, formerlyAcinetobacter calcoaceticus NCTC 10303), in which the presence of the trisaccharidel-Rhapα1→3l-Rhapα1→8Kdo had been reported in an earlier investigation (15Brade H. Tacken A. Christian R. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 167: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We now present the complete structure of this carbohydrate backbone, establishing a novel LPS core region comprising a novel branched Kdo tetrasaccharide that will help to extend our knowledge of multifunctional Kdo transferases. A. baumannii strain NCTC 10303 was cultivated as described (8Brade H. Galanos C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The LPS was obtained (yield: 3% of dry mass) from the lyophilized culture supernatant by a modified phenol/chloroform/light petroleum extraction as described (8Brade H. Galanos C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The LPS (80 mg) was hydrolyzed in 5% acetic acid (100 °C, 5 h), and the precipitate was removed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 ×g, 4 h). The supernatant was lyophilized (30 mg, 37.5% of the LPS) and contained a mixture of oligosaccharides which was separated on a column of Dowex 50-X4 (H+). Two fractions were obtained as follows: a neutral fraction, eluting with water, and a basic fraction, eluting with 5% aqueous ammonia. The basic fraction contained oligosaccharides 1 and 2, which were separated by using high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC). The neutral fraction was reduced with NaBH4 and separated using gel permeation chromatography on TSK-40 in water, which yielded as one fraction oligosaccharide 3 and a second, low molecular mass fraction that was not further investigated. For complete deacylation (16Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 214: 703-710Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the LPS (350 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous hydrazine (8 ml), stirred for 30 min at 37 °C, cooled, poured into ice-cold acetone (80 ml), and centrifuged (2,500 ×g, 30 min). The precipitate was washed twice with ice-cold acetone, dried, then dissolved in water, and lyophylized (de-O-acylated LPS, 236 mg, 67.4% of the LPS). An aliquot of this product (150 mg) was dissolved in 4 m KOH (2 ml), flushed with nitrogen for 1 h, and hydrolyzed in a sealed tube (100 °C, 16 h). After cooling and bringing to pH 6–7 with 2m HCl, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation (2,500 × g, 30 min.), and the supernatant was desalted using gel permeation chromatography on TSK-40 in water. From this fraction, oligosaccharides 4–6 were isolated by HPAEC (3, 5, and 5 mg; 0.86, 1.43, and 1.43% of the LPS, respectively). In a third experiment, the LPS (80 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous hydrazine (3 ml), kept at 60 °C for 120 h, and evaporated to dryness. Water was added to this sample, and the insoluble fatty acids were removed by centrifugation (2,500 × g, 30 min), the supernatant of which was injected onto a reversed-phase HPLC Delta-Pak C18 (Waters) column (2 × 30 cm) that was eluted using water and from which oligosaccharide 7 was isolated (8 mg, 10% of the LPS). Deamination of oligosaccharide 1 was performed with NaNO2 in 30% AcOH (1 h, 20 °C). Paper chromatography was carried out using pyridine/butanol/acetic acid/water (1:1:1:1, by volume). The conditions for gel permeation chromatography on TSK HW40(S) and determination of the absolute configurations of monosaccharide residues were as reported (17Vinogradov E.V. Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Broady K.W. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), as were the analytical methods used for the determination of phosphates, GlcN, Kdo, neutral monosaccharide residues, and fatty acids (18Kaca W. de Jongh-Leuvenink J. Zähringer U. Rietschel E.Th. Brade H. Verhoef J. Sinnwell V. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 179: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Analytical and semi-preparative HPAEC was performed as described (19Vinogradov E.V. Thomas-Oates J.E. Brade H. Holst O. J. Endotoxin. Res. 1994; 1: 199-206Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with the modification that the semi-preparative HPAEC column was eluted using gradient programs of 1–60% (oligosaccharides 1–3) or 30–80% (oligosaccharides 4–6) 1 m sodium acetate in 0.1m NaOH in 80 min. Gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry were performed as described (17Vinogradov E.V. Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Broady K.W. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Positive ion fast atom bombardment(FAB)-mass spectra were obtained using MS1 of a JEOL JMS-SX/SX102A tandem mass spectrometer operated at + or −10 kV accelerating voltage. The FAB gun was operated at 6 kV accelerating voltage with an emission current of 10 mA and using xenon as the bombarding gas. Spectra were scanned at a speed of 30 s for the full mass range specified by the accelerating voltage used and were recorded and averaged on a Hewlett-Packard HP9000 data system running JEOL COMPLEMENT software. Collision induced dissociation mass spectra were recorded using the same machine, with helium as the collision gas in the third field free region collision cell, at a pressure sufficient to reduce the parent ion to one-third of its original intensity. The oligosaccharide was dissolved in 50 μl of water, and 1-μl aliquots of sample solution were loaded into a matrix of mono-thioglycerol, to which 1 μl of trifluoroacetic acid was added for the analysis of the untreated oligosaccharide. Negative ion mode electrospray mass spectrometry was performed on a VG Platform II single quadrupole mass spectrometer. Five μl of the oligosaccharide solution made for the FAB mass spectrometric analysis were diluted by addition of 50 μl of water, and 10 μl of this solution was infused into a mobile phase of acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v) and introduced into the electrospray source at a flow rate of 5 μl min−1. Spectra were scanned at a speed of 10 s for m/z 700–1700, with a cone voltage of 60 V and recorded and processed using the MassLynx software, version 2.0. Structural assignments were made from sample solutions in 2H2O at 27 or 37 °C. For compounds 1–6, 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 600.13 MHz for 1H and 150.90 MHz for13C with a Bruker AMX 600 spectrometer, and chemical shifts were reported relative to internal acetone (2.225 ppm for1H and 31.5 ppm for 13C). The1H,31P COSY spectrum was recorded at 101.25 MHz on a Bruker DRX 250 instrument at ambient temperature. Correlation spectroscopy (COSY), total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy (NOESY), and heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) spectra were assigned using the computer program PRONTO (20Kjaer M. Andersen K.V. Poulsen F.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 288-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For compound 7, spectra were recorded on a solution of 5 mg in 2H2O with a Varian INOVA 750 spectrometer at 750.04 MHz for 1H and at 188.6 MHz for 13C at 27 °C. The double quantum-filtered phase-sensitive COSY experiment was performed using the Varian standard program TNDQCOSY (21Piatini U. Sørensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1888) Google Scholar, 22Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar), with 0.34 s acquisition time and 4 K data points. F1 was zero-filled to give a matrix of 4 × 2K points and was resolution-enhanced in both dimensions by a shifted sine bell. NOESY was performed using the Varian standard program TNNOESY (23States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 200 ms. TOCSY was performed using the Varian standard program TNTOCSY (24Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar, 25Levitt M. Freeman R. Frenkiel T. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 47: 328-330Google Scholar), with a spin-lock time of 120 ms. The heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy was performed using the pulse field gradient standard Varian program GHSQC (26Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2435) Google Scholar), with a gradient strength of 4, 4, and 2 G/cm and gradient time of respectively 2, 2, and 0.5 ms, respectively. Conformational analysis was performed using the hard sphere exoanomeric-based GEGOP program (27Peters T. Meyer B. Stuike-Prill R. Somorjai R. Brisson J.-R. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 238: 49-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,28Stuike-Prill R. Meyer B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) at 800 and 1200 K with Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations with up to 3 × 106 steps. The α- and β-d-Kdo coordinates were taken from a published x-ray structure (29Birnbaum G.I. Roy R. Brisson J.-R. Jennings H.J. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1987; 6: 17-39Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For a semi-quantitative comparison with the observed NOE proton-proton distances, <r −6> were monitored. Furthermore, minimization and molecular dynamics were carried out for some oligosaccharides fragments using the computer program DISCOVER with the consistent valence force field (30Hagler A.T. Lifson S. Dauber R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 5122-5130Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 31Asensio J.L. Martin-Pastor M. Jimenez-Barbero J. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1995; 17: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Most of the LPS from A. baumannii NCTC 10303 was released from the bacteria into the culture supernatant, from which it could be isolated using a modification of the phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether method (8Brade H. Galanos C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The additional extraction of dried bacteria gave less than 0.1% of the total LPS yield. Monosaccharide analysis of the LPS and determination of the absolute configurations of monosaccharides revealed the presence of l-Rha, d-Kdo, and d-GlcN. The configuration of Kdo was determined by measuring the optical rotation of its methyl ester, α-methylketoside derivative, isolated after mild methanolysis of the LPS. Further compositional analyses of the LPS identified phosphorus, dodecanoic acid, 2-hydroxydodecanoic acid, and 3-hydroxydodecanoic acid, the last of which was the only amide-bound fatty acid in the lipid A, as revealed by fatty acid analysis of de-O-acylated LPS. In an earlier investigation (15Brade H. Tacken A. Christian R. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 167: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the trisaccharidel-Rhapα1→3l-Rhapα1→8Kdo had been obtained from one LPS of A. baumannii NCTC 10303 after mild acidic hydrolysis, dialysis, and separation of the dialysate on Bio-Gel P2. However, a second fraction possessing a higher molecular mass had additionally been isolated which contained Rha, Kdo, and phosphate but had not been investigated further. Consequently, the first step of the current investigation comprised hydrolysis of the LPS with 5% acetic acid in order to characterize the complete spectrum of products. Separation of the hydrolysate using ion exchange chromatography gave a basic fraction that was separated further using HPAEC that yielded oligosaccharides 1 and 2 and a neutral fraction that contained oligosaccharide mixture 3. The structures of oligosaccharides 1 and 2 were established using NMR spectroscopy (Tables I and II). The 1H assignments are based on two-dimensional phase-sensitive COSY and TOCSY and that of 13C on HMQC experiments. Anomeric configurations are assigned on the basis of the chemical shifts observed, and J 1,2 values were determined from the COSY experiment (Table I). Oligosaccharide 1 consists of one residue each of 2,7-anhydro-3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulofuranosidic acid (2,7-anh-Kdof), a hexosaminuronic acid (13C NMR data, C-6 at 174.1 ppm in oligosaccharide 1) and a hexosamine. 2,7-anh-Kdof represents an artifact originating from acid hydrolysis of Kdo (32McNicholas P.A. Batley M. Redmond J.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 165: 17-22Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is identified by its1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts and J H, H coupling constants that are in full agreement with those published (32McNicholas P.A. Batley M. Redmond J.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 165: 17-22Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The hexosamine possesses thegluco-configuration, as revealed by its coupling constantsJ 2,3 and J 3,4 (∼10 Hz). The coupling constants of the hexosaminuronic acid could not be determined from this sample due to signal overlapping; however, this was possible with oligosaccharide 2 which was identified as a partial structure of oligosaccharide 1, namely the reducing disaccharide hexosamine-hexosaminuronic acid. Thus, the hexosaminuronic acid also possesses the gluco-configuration (J 2,3, 10 Hz; J 3,4, 9 Hz). In both amino sugars, the amino group is located at C-2 as follows from the chemical shifts for C-2 at 54–59 ppm. Both, oligosaccharides 1 and 2 possess one N-acetyl group. As revealed by the chemical shifts of H-2, the amino group of the glucosamine is acetylated (3.814 ppm in oligosaccharide 1 and 3.822 ppm in 2), whereas that of the glucosaminuronic acid is free (2.71 ppm in oligosaccharide 1, 2.74 (α) and 3.02 (β) ppm in 2). The absolute configuration of glucosaminuronic acid could be determined as D using conformational analysis (see below); thus, the amino sugars in oligosaccharides 1 and 2 are 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose (d-GlcpNAc) and 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosuronic acid (d-GlcpNA). The sequence of monosaccharides in oligosaccharides 1 and 2 was determined by NOE measurements that gave NOE contacts between G1 and F4, and betweenF1 and E4 and E5. 2,7-anh-Kdof cannot be substituted at O-5 and hence must be glycosylated at O-4.

Chemical shifts are expressed relative to acetone (34.5 ppm at 27 °C): monosaccharides A–L are as shown in Fig. 1. Since the Kdo residue E is substituted by GlcpNA, the amino group that stabilizes the glycosidic bond, it cannot be liberated under conventional hydrolysis or methanolysis conditions. Consequently, its absolute configuration was determined by measuring the optical rotation of 2,7-anh-Kdof, obtained after deamination of oligosaccharide 1 and paper chromatography. The optical rotation of the product was αD +63° which is close to that of the reference compound prepared from authentic Kdo (αD +68°) and allowed assignment of thed-configuration. The presence of both oligosaccharides 1 and 2 can be explained by the finding that mild acid hydrolysis of Kdo yields 5-(d-erythro-1,2,3-trihydroxypropyl)-2-furoic acid and 2,7-anh-Kdof (32McNicholas P.A. Batley M. Redmond J.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 165: 17-22Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The formation of the first product eliminates the substituent at O-4, resulting in compound 2, whereas the formation of 2,7-anhydro-Kdof yields trisaccharide 1. The neutral fraction obtained on ion exchange chromatography of the LPS hydrolysate contained a mixture of several oligosaccharides with similar compositions. It was reduced with NaBH4 to give mixture 3, the NMR spectra of which contained signals for terminal and 3-substituted α-Rhap, and various signals of lower intensity, originating from Kdo derivatives (data not shown). Monosaccharide analysis of mixture 3 identified Rha and polyols and anhydropolyols of Kdo. Methylation analysis identified terminal and 3-substituted Rha in the molar ratio of ∼1:2.5. The ratio Rha:Kdo could not be determined because of the presence of multiple forms of Kdo. However, it may be concluded that mixture 3 consists of several oligosacharides (predominantly tri- and tetrasaccharides) with structures similar to that of the previously identified trisaccharidel-Rhapα1→3l-Rhapα1→8Kdo (15Brade H.

Although HSactconstitutes only 1–10% of HStotal, the relative abundance of this polysaccharide is greater by at least 10-fold than would be predicted by completely random assembly of disaccharide constituents (14Casu B. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1985; 43: 51-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that production of the AT-binding site sequence requires the coordinated action of several biosynthetic enzymes. A cellular regulatory mechanism must direct the biosynthetic enzymes to carry out the appropriate sequence of epimerization/sulfation reactions to generate the AT-binding domain. To define the components that regulate HSact biosynthesis, our laboratory has purified as well as molecularly cloned the critical limiting factor, 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 (12Liu J. Shworak N.W.

The approach described in this article is to investigate cell biologic systems exhibiting a dramatic increase in HSact biosynthesis and then determine the components involved in the HSact production.The parietal yolk sac of mice is the outermost of extraembryonic membranes. It consists of trophoblast cells, parietal endoderm, and Reichert's membrane. Reichert's membrane is a thick layer of extracellular matrix secreted by parietal endoderm. The parietal yolk sac is permeable to macromolecules in the maternal circulation and allows macromolecules to reach the embryo within the maternal circulation. Natural anticoagulants, e.g. thrombomodulin and tissue-type plasminogen activator, are expressed high level at this interface between fetal and maternal tissue which indicates the need to counter the activation of maternally derived coagulation protease in proximity to the embryo (15Weiler-Guettler H., Yu, K.

It has been reported that heparan sulfate isolated from murine Reichert's membrane bound almost quantitatively and with high affinity to AT (19Pejler G. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Paulsson M.

All the evidence above suggest that parietal endoderm would be an ideal system for anticoagulant heparan sulfate biosynthesis studies. Upon RACT treatment, F9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells differentiate into parietal endoderm and turn on the biosynthesis of both thrombomodulin and tissue-type plasminogen activator (15Weiler-Guettler H., Yu, K.

In this report, we will demonstrate that: (i) HSact biosynthesis is up-regulated by 170-fold in RACT F9 cells due to a 100-fold increase in 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 mRNA and enzymatic activity; (ii) 30% of RACT F9 and control F9 HStotal could be converted to HSact (HSact precursor pool) with a constant 30% of 3-O-sulfation occuring in HSact and 70% of 3-O-sulfation in HSinact. RACT F9 cells convert about 70% of the HSact precursor pool to HSact whereas the control F9 cells convert only about 3% of the HSact precursor pool to HSact. This study suggests that HSact synthesis in the F9 system is predominantly determined by the abundance of 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 and the size of the HSactprecursor pool.DISCUSSIONThis report is the first study of up-regulation of the placental anticoagulant heparan sulfate biosynthesis mechanism. It describes a cell biologic system that exhibited minimal concentrations of 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 which can be dramatically up-regulated with a 2–4-fold changes in the levels of N-ST, 2-O-ST, or 6-O-ST. The results described suggest that HSact generation in the F9 cell system is predominantly determined by the abundance of 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 and the size of the HSact precursor pool.Previous reports from our laboratory showed that the amount of 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 in LTA cells limits HSactproduction. This enzyme acts upon HSact precursor to generate HSact and HSinact precursor to produce HSinact. 3-O-Sulfotransferase-1 modifies precursors to only a limited extent, so the great bulk of the HSact precursor and HSinact precursor exits the Golgi and appears in an unmodified form on the cell surface (12Liu J.

In RACT-induced F9 cells, 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 no longer appears to limit the HSact production. The size of HSact precursor pool defines the proportion of HSact generation. Thus, the RACT-induced F9 cell is similar to the mast cell, which contains a large proportion of molecules with the AT binding property (30%) (2Lam L.H. Silbert J.E. Rosenberg R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical analysis also indicates that the precursor of anticoagulant heparin in mast cells might be present in only small amounts (28Linhardt R.J. Wang H. Loganathan D. Bae J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2380-2387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kusche M. Torri G. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7292-7300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast, CHO cells lack any detectable 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 activity and do not produce any HSact. However, these cells generate significant amount of HSactprecursors. 3L. Zhang and R. D. Rosenberg, unpublished observation. This observation suggests that the HSact precursor formation is predetermined by other epimerase and sulfotransferases other than 3-O-sulfotransferase-1. Disaccharide analysis results in Table III suggest HSact precursor must be structurally distinct from HSinact precursor since: 1) the disaccharide composition is different in HSact and HSinact; 2) the HSact precursor, but not the HSinactprecursor, can be converted to HSact. The structurally different precursors imply that biosynthetic enzymes prior to addition of 3-O-sulfate must regulate the generation of the two populations. The identification of this control mechanism would constitute an important regulatory element in the delineation of the biosynthetic pathway of HSact generation and is under active examination in our laboratory.3-O-Sulfated disaccharides (GlcA-anManR3S and GlcA-anManR3S6S) accounted for about 18% of O-sulfated disaccharides in HSact, which consists of either 1 or 20% of HStotal in F9 or RACT F9 (Table III). The high percentage of 3-O-sulfated disaccharides in HSact chain suggests that there are multiple 3-O-sulfation sites per HS chain 4Six pmol of [35S]sulfates from PAP35S are transferred to 3-O-sulfate positions in 1 pmol of F9 HS. It suggests that there are six 3-O-sulfation sites per HS chain. L. Zhang (K. Yoshida, J. Liu, and R. D. Rosenberg), unpublished result. and that 3-O-sulfates are either added to all the sites or none of the sites during biosynthesis. Furthermore, 3-O-sulfated disaccharides (GlcA-anManR3S and GlcA-anManR3S6S) accounted for 10% of O-sulfated disaccharides in 80% RACT F9 HSinact. This is the highest percentage of GlcA-anManR3S and GlcA-anManR3S6S in HSinact ever being reported. The potential biological functions of the 3-O-sulfated HSinact especially in parietal yolk sac is an interesting area to explore.Usually, mammalian cell lines possess excess enzymatic activity for HS production which can be used to produce another 3–4-fold excess HS if HS primer (26Fritz T.A. Lugemwa F.N. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 300-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or HS core protein (27Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27127-27135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) are introduced into the cells. A 9-fold increase in HS production and 2–4-fold increase in N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfotransferase activities suggest that F9 cells have excessive sulfotransferase activities that allow RACT-induced F9 cells to make more HS.Our current data shows that 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 can be dramatically up-regulated without significant changes in the levels of N-ST, 2-O-ST, or 6-O-ST in RACT-induced F9 cells. This result suggests that the transcriptional mechanism that regulates 3-O-ST-1 expression is different from those of N-ST, 2-O-ST, or 6-O-ST in this cell system. Our preliminary nuclear run-off data indicate that RACT-dependent up-regulation in 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 activity and mRNA levels in F9 cells are due to the up-regulation of 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 gene transcriptional activity (data not shown). The up-regulation of 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 activity provides a simple mechanism for up-regulation HSact production in cell line that produce HSact precursors. However, RACT fails to induce an elevation in 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 activity in CHO cells (Fig. 1). Thus, other factors in F9 cells are critical for such an induction. The up-regulation of 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 transcription by RACT may resemble the RACT-dependent synergistic mechanism of thrombomodulin gene transcription. It has been speculated that this RACT-dependent synergism results from RA-dependent alterations in cAMP-dependent signaling pathways, changes in the effective levels of cAMP-dependent transcription factors, or the occurrence of cooperative interactions between RA receptors and cAMP transcription factors (15Weiler-Guettler H., Yu, K. Soff G. Gudas L.J. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 89: 2155-2159Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to identify the precise factors that permit the RACT induced increase in 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 gene transcription in F9 cells. The knowledge obtained should pinpoint critical molecular interactions that initiate development of the natural anticoagulant mechanisms of parietal yolk sac.We have previously demonstrated that the knockout of thrombomodulin lead to embryonic lethality via an anticoagulant independent mechanism (18Healy A.M. Rayburn H.B. Rosenberg R.D. Weiler-Guettler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Based on this result, it is possible in an analogous fashion that 3-O-sulfated HSinact may play a critical role in placental function. The knockout of 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 may provide information concern this potential non-anticoagulant function of 3-O-sulfated HSinact. Heparin and heparan sulfate are synthesized as the repeat unit, (GlcNAcα1–4GlcAβ1–4)n (where n = 20–100) along with a series of modification reactions include GlcNAcN-deacetylation, GlcN N-sulfation, GlcNAc/GlcN 6-O-sulfation, GlcA epimerization to l-IdA, GlcA/IdA 2-O-sulfation, and 3-O-sulfation of GlcN residues (1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). This multienzyme pathway generates a subpopulation of heparin/heparan sulfate exhibiting anticoagulant properties (HSact).1 These regions of defined structures contain antithrombin (AT)-binding domain sequence found in anticoagulant heparin/heparan sulfate: uronic acid → glucosamine (N-acetyl/N-sulfate) 6-O-sulfate → glucuronic acid → glucosamineN-sulfate 3-O-sulfate (6-O-sulfate) → iduronic acid 2-O-sulfate → glucosamineN-sulfate 6-O-sulfate (2Lam L.H.

The 6-O-sulfate on residue 2 and the 3-O-sulfate on residue 4 function in a thermodynamically linked fashion to supply half of the binding energy for the interaction with AT, and trigger a conformational change that accelerates neutralization of specific coagulation proteases (9Atha D.H.

These reactions also produce HSinact that lacks the primary AT-binding domain but contains all the other monosaccharide sequences including 3-O-sulfated residues (12Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S.

Although HSactconstitutes only 1–10% of HStotal, the relative abundance of this polysaccharide is greater by at least 10-fold than would be predicted by completely random assembly of disaccharide constituents (14Casu B. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1985; 43: 51-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that production of the AT-binding site sequence requires the coordinated action of several biosynthetic enzymes. A cellular regulatory mechanism must direct the biosynthetic enzymes to carry out the appropriate sequence of epimerization/sulfation reactions to generate the AT-binding domain. To define the components that regulate HSact biosynthesis, our laboratory has purified as well as molecularly cloned the critical limiting factor, 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 (12Liu J. Shworak N.W.

The approach described in this article is to investigate cell biologic systems exhibiting a dramatic increase in HSact biosynthesis and then determine the components involved in the HSact production. The parietal yolk sac of mice is the outermost of extraembryonic membranes. It consists of trophoblast cells, parietal endoderm, and Reichert's membrane. Reichert's membrane is a thick layer of extracellular matrix secreted by parietal endoderm. The parietal yolk sac is permeable to macromolecules in the maternal circulation and allows macromolecules to reach the embryo within the maternal circulation. Natural anticoagulants, e.g. thrombomodulin and tissue-type plasminogen activator, are expressed high level at this interface between fetal and maternal tissue which indicates the need to counter the activation of maternally derived coagulation protease in proximity to the embryo (15Weiler-Guettler H., Yu, K.

Weiler-Guettler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It has been reported that heparan sulfate isolated from murine Reichert's membrane bound almost quantitatively and with high affinity to AT (19Pejler G. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Paulsson M. Dziadek M. Fujiwara S. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the evidence above suggest that parietal endoderm would be an ideal system for anticoagulant heparan sulfate biosynthesis studies. Upon RACT treatment, F9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells differentiate into parietal endoderm and turn on the biosynthesis of both thrombomodulin and tissue-type plasminogen activator (15Weiler-Guettler H., Yu, K.

In this report, we will demonstrate that: (i) HSact biosynthesis is up-regulated by 170-fold in RACT F9 cells due to a 100-fold increase in 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 mRNA and enzymatic activity; (ii) 30% of RACT F9 and control F9 HStotal could be converted to HSact (HSact precursor pool) with a constant 30% of 3-O-sulfation occuring in HSact and 70% of 3-O-sulfation in HSinact. RACT F9 cells convert about 70% of the HSact precursor pool to HSact whereas the control F9 cells convert only about 3% of the HSact precursor pool to HSact. This study suggests that HSact synthesis in the F9 system is predominantly determined by the abundance of 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 and the size of the HSactprecursor pool. DISCUSSIONThis report is the first study of up-regulation of the placental anticoagulant heparan sulfate biosynthesis mechanism. It describes a cell biologic system that exhibited minimal concentrations of 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 which can be dramatically up-regulated with a 2–4-fold changes in the levels of N-ST, 2-O-ST, or 6-O-ST. The results described suggest that HSact generation in the F9 cell system is predominantly determined by the abundance of 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 and the size of the HSact precursor pool.Previous reports from our laboratory showed that the amount of 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 in LTA cells limits HSactproduction. This enzyme acts upon HSact precursor to generate HSact and HSinact precursor to produce HSinact. 3-O-Sulfotransferase-1 modifies precursors to only a limited extent, so the great bulk of the HSact precursor and HSinact precursor exits the Golgi and appears in an unmodified form on the cell surface (12Liu J.

In RACT-induced F9 cells, 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 no longer appears to limit the HSact production. The size of HSact precursor pool defines the proportion of HSact generation. Thus, the RACT-induced F9 cell is similar to the mast cell, which contains a large proportion of molecules with the AT binding property (30%) (2Lam L.H. Silbert J.E. Rosenberg R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical analysis also indicates that the precursor of anticoagulant heparin in mast cells might be present in only small amounts (28Linhardt R.J. Wang H. Loganathan D. Bae J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2380-2387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kusche M. Torri G. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7292-7300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast, CHO cells lack any detectable 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 activity and do not produce any HSact. However, these cells generate significant amount of HSactprecursors. 3L. Zhang and R. D. Rosenberg, unpublished observation. This observation suggests that the HSact precursor formation is predetermined by other epimerase and sulfotransferases other than 3-O-sulfotransferase-1.

The small Rho family GTPases, Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, play a key role in controlling cell motility and morphology in many types of eukaryotic cells. In cultured fibroblasts, active GTP-Cdc42 and GTP-Rac promote the extension of actin filament-containing filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively, whereas in budding yeast, Cdc42 is involved in the control of cell polarity (reviewed in Refs. 1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar and 2Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). At least some of the effects of Cdc42 and Rac are mediated through the direct activation of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that includes the mammalian p21-activated kinases (PAKs)1 and the budding yeast Ste20p kinase (for reviews, see Refs. 3Lim L.

Recently, studies using the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum and the soil amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii have forged an important link between members of the PAK family and the regulation of myosin I. Myosin I is a small, single-headed myosin consisting of a heavy chain and one or more light chains (reviewed in Refs. 6Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar and 7Pollard T.D. Doberstein S.K. Zot H.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 653-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino terminus of the heavy chain forms a conserved motor domain that exhibits actin-activated MgATPase activity, whereas the carboxyl terminus forms a nonhelical tail that contains a positively charged acidic phospholipid-binding domain and, in some isoforms, an SH3 domain and an actin filament-binding domain. Gene disruption studies in Dictyostelium and yeast indicate that myosin I plays an important role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton and participates in motile processes at the plasma membrane, such as phagocytosis, endocytosis, and pseudopod extension (8Novak K.D.

The Dictyostelium, Acanthamoeba, and yeast myosins I are inactive unless a specific serine or threonine residue in the heavy chain motor domain is phosphorylated (11Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S.

Myosin I heavy chain kinases (MIHCKs) have been purified from Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium and found by sequence analysis to have catalytic domains with a high degree of sequence identity to those of the PAK family kinases (15Brzeska H.

In addition, theDictyostelium MIHCK contains a Cdc42/Rac binding site similar to that present in PAK (16Lee S.-F. Egelhoff T.T. Mahasneh A. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27044-27048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The close relationship between MIHCK and other members of the PAK family is highlighted by the finding that Ste20p, Cla4p, and PAK efficiently phosphorylate and activateAcanthamoeba and Dictyostelium myosin I isoforms (17Wu C.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30623-30626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Dictyostelium MIHCK, like PAK, interacts specifically with the active, GTP-bound state of Cdc42 and Rac1 (16Lee S.-F. Egelhoff T.T. Mahasneh A. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27044-27048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Whereas the autophosphorylation and kinase activity of PAK is highly dependent on GTP-Cdc42 or GTP-Rac1 (19Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), Dictyostelium MIHCK readily incorporates 1 mol of phosphate/mol, with a concomitant ∼40-fold increase in kinase activity, in the absence of activators (14Lee S.-F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). GTP-Cdc42 and GTP-Rac1 do, however, stimulate the autophosphorylation of Dictyostelium MIHCK to ∼10 mol of phosphate/mol and increase kinase activity a further 10–15-fold (16Lee S.-F. Egelhoff T.T. Mahasneh A. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27044-27048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Acanthamoeba MIHCK, in contrast, fully autophosphorylates and displays a maximal level of activity without any requirement for regulatory molecules, although the rate of autophosphorylation is accelerated ∼20-fold by acidic phospholipids and plasma membranes (20Brzeska H. Lynch T.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3591-3594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Brzeska H. Lynch T.J. Martin B. Corigliano-Murphy A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16138-16144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of Acanthamoeba MIHCK with acidic phospholipids is inhibited by calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner (22Brzeska H. Kulesza-Lipka D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23870-23875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present, the available information suggests that the regulatory properties of the Dictyostelium and AcanthamoebaMIHCKs are quite different, raising the issue of whether the upstream signaling pathways controlling myosin I are conserved from one organism to another. In this paper, we demonstrate that theDictyostelium MIHCK is regulated by acidic phospholipids and Ca2+-calmodulin in a manner similar to theAcanthamoeba MIHCK and identify the key autophosphorylation site responsible for the initial activation of DictyosteliumMIHCK as Ser-8. ATP (grade I), GTPγS, Tes, bovine serum albumin, bovine brain calmodulin, grade VI apyrase, sphingosine (S-6879), and phosphoamino acid standards were obtained from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products, and phospholipids were from Serdary Research Laboratories (London, Ontario, Canada). Dictyostelium myosin ID and MIHCK were prepared as described (14Lee S.-F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Lee S.-F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20923-20929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human Rac1 was expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein (kindly provided by Dr. Alan Hall, MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, London, United Kingdom) and was purified over glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rac1 was loaded with GTPγS as described (24Manser E. Leung T. Lim L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). MIHCK activity was assayed in Buffer A (25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tes, pH 7.0, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 0.25 mm[γ-32P]ATP (500 Ci/mol). The concentrations of MIHCK, substrates, inhibitors, and activators for individual experiments are provided in the figure legends. Assays were initiated by the addition of MIHCK. To quantify the incorporation of 32P into proteins, aliquots of 10–20 μl were removed from the reaction, added to one-fifth volume of boiling SDS sample buffer (5% SDS, 30% sucrose, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol), and subjected to SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The appropriate protein band was then excised from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel and counted in scintillation fluid in a liquid scintillation counter. Incorporation of 32P into peptides was determined by spotting aliquots onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman) (14Lee S.-F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Conditions were chosen so that the incorporation of32P into the substrate was linear over the time course of the experiment and proportional to the amount of MIHCK. MIHCK was incubated at a concentration of 30 μg/ml in Buffer A containing 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1000 Ci/mol) at 25 °C in the presence or absence of 0.5 mmphosphatidylserine (PS) and/or 0.2 mg/ml GTPγS-Rac1. After 1 h, the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the MIHCK was electrophoresed on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) (26Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). A narrow strip of Immobilon-P containing MIHCK (visualized with amido black) was excised, blocked for 20 min with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidine (BDH Chemicals) in 0.1 m acetic acid, washed extensively with water, cut into small pieces, and incubated with trypsin (2 μg) in 50 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, at 37 °C for 2 days, with the addition of a second aliquot of trypsin after 1 day (27Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Following lyophilization, the sample was spotted onto a cellulose thin layer plate (Eastman Kodak) and subjected to electrophoresis in a Camag thin layer electrophoresis cell at pH 1.9 (acetic acid:formic acid:water, 8:2:90, v/v) for 1.5 h at 1000 V. Separation in the second dimension was by ascending chromatography in 1-butanol:pyridine:acetic acid:water (50:33:10:40) (27Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on MIHCK electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P (28Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).32P-Labeled peptides and phosphoamino acids were visualized by exposing the plates at −80 °C to Kodak X-AR film with an intensifying screen (NEN Life Science Products). To isolate sufficient material for sequence analysis, 200 μg of MIHCK was incubated in Buffer A containing 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (600 Ci/mol) at 25 °C for 1 h. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P, and digested as described above, except that the digestion volume was 1 ml, and a total of 20 μg of trypsin was added. After lyophilization, the digest was redissolved in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and chromatographed over a Pep S reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a gradient of increasing acetonitrile concentration. Sequence analysis of the 32P-labeled peptides was performed by the Biotechnology Service Center, Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Toronto. Phospholipid vesicles were prepared essentially as described in (29Brzeska H. Martin B. Kulesza-Lipka D. Baines I. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vesicles were stored in 10% sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmTes, pH 7.0, and phospholipid concentrations were determined by measurement of total phosphate (30Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3000) Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed by mixing MIHCK with phospholipid vesicles (0.5 mm total lipid) in Buffer A at room temperature and centrifuging the mixture at 200,000 × g for 20 min in a Beckman TL100 centrifuge. The resulting pellets were washed once with Buffer A, resuspended to the same volume as the supernatants, and subjected, along with the supernatants, to SDS-PAGE. The calmodulin binding assay was performed by mixing 20 μl of bovine brain calmodulin-agarose beads (Sigma) with MIHCK in Buffer A containing 0.005% Tween 80 and either 25 μm CaCl2 or 0.1 mm EGTA. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged for 2 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 2500 rpm. The resulting pellets were washed twice with Buffer A plus 0.005% Tween 80, resuspended to the original volume, and analyzed, with the supernatants, by SDS-PAGE. The relative amount of MIHCK in each fraction was quantified by scanning the Coomassie Blue-stained gel at 596 nm with an LKB 2202 Ultro laser densitometer. Extracts for immunoblotting were prepared by homogenizing D. discoideum AX-3 cells in 2 volumes of extraction buffer (14Lee S.-F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) containing either 20 or 100 mm KCl. Extracts were centrifuged at 200,000 ×g for 30 min in a Beckman TL100 centrifuge to obtain supernatant and particulate fractions. Immunoblot analysis of proteins transferred to Immobilon-P with affinity purified anti-Dictyostelium MIHCK and anti-Dictyosteliummyosin ID rabbit polyclonal antibodies were performed as described (16Lee S.-F. Egelhoff T.T. Mahasneh A. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27044-27048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,23Lee S.-F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20923-20929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the colorimetric assay of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Library screening and DNA manipulations were done according to standard procedures as described previously (16Lee S.-F. Egelhoff T.T. Mahasneh A. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27044-27048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To construct a fusion of GST with residues 1–42 of Dictyostelium MIHCK, the portion of the MIHCK cDNA coding for this fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the full length MIHCK cDNA using the sense primer GAATTCATGGAGCAATCAAAAAGAG and the antisense primer TGGTACCATTGGTTTGTACCC. The resulting 126-base pair product was cloned into pCR®2.1 (Invitrogen) and then cut withEcoRI and ligated into pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant fusion protein, designated GST-MIHCK1–42, was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α and purified over a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two-dimensional peptide maps of MIHCK phosphorylated to 1 mol/mol and digested with trypsin revealed the presence of a single major phosphopeptide (Fig. 1, None, 1). Chromatography of the tryptic digest over a reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography column yielded two major peaks of radioactivity, both of which electrophoresed on thin layer plates with a mobility identical to the major phosphopeptide in Fig. 1 (data not shown). Amino acid sequence analysis of the first peak indicated the presence of a major peptide (GQNYDR) and a minor peptide (RVSMMR), whereas the second peak yielded RVSMMR as a unique sequence. The peptide GQNYDR lacks Ser and Thr residues and so must represent an unphosphorylated peptide that co-eluted with the phosphopeptide. It is not clear why the RVSMMR peptide was recovered in two distinct peaks from the reverse-phase column, although a possible explanation could be oxidation of one of the methionines to methionine sulfoxide (32Linde S. Nielsen J.H. Hansen B. Welinder B.S. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 530: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A peptide sequence corresponding to RVSMMR is not present in the published MIHCK sequence (16Lee S.-F. Egelhoff T.T. Mahasneh A. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27044-27048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Isolation of additional cDNAs from a DictyosteliumcDNA library revealed that the amino-terminal 53 amino acids originally reported for Dictyostelium MIHCK are incorrect and must have arisen from a cloning artifact in which an irrelevant cDNA was ligated to a cDNA encoding the 5′-end of MIHCK. The corrected sequence replaces these 53 residues with the 9 residues MEQSKRVSM. The rest of the MIHCK sequence, starting at residue Met-10 (formerly Met-54) remains unchanged. The amino-terminal sequence has been confirmed by PCR analysis and has also been independently reported by M. Strom (GenBankTM accession number Y10158). The revised sequence of Dictyostelium MIHCK predicts an 851-residue enzyme with a molecular mass of 93,015. Importantly, the phosphorylated peptide RVSMMR can now be identified as residues 6–10 in MIHCK, placing the phosphorylated serine required for activation of MIHCK at position 8. Previous studies have suggested that the initial activation of MIHCK depends on an intermolecular autophosphorylation event (14Lee S.-F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A fragment encompassing residues 1–42 of MIHCK, expressed as a GST fusion protein, was readily phosphorylated by MIHCK (Fig. 2 A). Tryptic peptide maps of the phosphorylated GST-MIHCK1–42 fusion protein revealed the presence of a single phosphopeptide with a mobility identical to that of the RVSMMR phosphopeptide (data not shown). A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 4–11 of MIHCK (but with Ser-4 replaced with Ala) was phosphorylated by MIHCK with a k catsimilar to that for a peptide based on the Dictyosteliummyosin ID heavy chain phosphorylation site and a K mabout 6-fold higher (Table I). These results identify Ser-8 as a potential substrate for MIHCK.Table IActivity assays of Dictyostelium MIHCKActivatorPeptide substratek catK ms−1μmRac1MIHCK4–11598PSMIHCK4–115.4116NonemyoD0.316Rac1myoD4.617PSmyoD4.719MIHCK (30 μg/ml) was preincubated for 30 min at 25 °C in Buffer A with 0.25 mm ATP either in the absence of activators (None), with 0.5 mm phosphatidylserine vesicles (PS), or with 0.2 mg/ml GTPγS-Rac1 (Rac1). The MIHCK was then diluted 20-fold into Buffer A containing 0.25 mm [γ-32P]ATP (500 Ci/mol) and a synthetic peptide corresponding either to residues 4–11 of MIHCK (MIHCK4–11) (AKRVSMMR; note that Ser-4 is replaced by Ala) or to the consensus site of phosphorylation in the Dictyostelium myosin ID heavy chain (myoD) (GRSARVSTYA; the phosphorylated serine is underlined) (14Lee S.-F.

The binding of MIHCK to vesicles composed of the electrically neutral phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) or the negatively charged phospholipids PS or phosphatidylinositol (PI) was investigated using co-sedimentation experiments. MIHCK did not pellet in the absence of phospholipids or in the presence of PC but pelleted with PS and PI (Fig. 2 B).Dictyostelium myosin ID, the best characterized substrate for MIHCK, also co-sedimented with vesicles composed of PS and PI (Fig. 2 B). Western blot analysis showed that a significant amount of MIHCK and myosin ID were present in membranes isolated fromDictyostelium by ultracentrifugation, but only at low ionic strength (Fig. 2 C). The presence of 100 mm KCl in the extraction buffer was sufficient to release the majority of MIHCK and myosin ID into the cytosol (Fig. 2 C). PS vesicles dramatically enhanced the amount of phosphate incorporated into MIHCK, resulting in a lower electrophoretic mobility of the kinase on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3). The initial rate of autophosphorylation of MIHCK was also significantly accelerated by PS (Fig. 3). Quantification of the linear portion of the MIHCK phosphorylation time course showed that PS enhanced the initial rate of MIHCK phosphorylation 35-fold, compared with a 20-fold acceleration by GTPγS-Rac1 (Fig. 4 A). The presence of 60 mm KCl completely inhibited the stimulatory effects of PS, indicating that the interaction of MIHCK with the acidic lipid is primarily electrostatic (Fig. 4 A). Two other acidic phospholipids, PI and phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PIP2), also greatly enhanced the rate of MIHCK phosphorylation, whereas PC did not. The positively charged lipid sphingosine, which recently has been shown to potently activate PAK autophosphorylation (33Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), had little effect on MIHCK (Fig. 4 A). Vesicles had to contain at least 70% PS to stimulate the rate of MIHCK phosphorylation and exceed 60% PS to bind MIHCK (Fig. 4 B). PI and PIP2 had to comprise about 50% of total vesicle lipid to bind and activate MIHCK (data not shown).Figure 4Acidic phospholipids and GTPγS-Rac stimulate the initial rate of MIHCK autophosphorylation. A, MIHCK (30 μg/ml) was incubated in Buffer A containing 0.25 mm [γ-32P]ATP (500 Ci/mol) with no additions (None), with 0.2 mg/ml GTPγS-GST-Rac (Rac), or with 0.5 mm of PS, PI, PIP2, PC, or sphingosine (Sph). In the assay designated PS+KCl, KCl was added to a final concentration of 60 mm. To obtain linear rates of 32P incorporation, aliquots of 10 μl were taken from the reaction labeledNone at 2, 4, and 6 min and from reactions containing GTPγS-GST-Rac and acidic lipids at 20, 40, and 60 s. The rate of32P incorporation into MIHCK with no additions was 0.7 nmol/min·mg. The incorporation of 32P into MIHCK was determined following SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The result shown are the means of two independent experiments. B, phospholipid vesicles containing the indicated percentage of PS mixed with PC were examined for their ability to bind MIHCK and to activate the initial rate of MIHCK autophosphorylation. MIHCK phosphorylation rates were determined as described above in A, and the phospholipid co-sedimentation binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Conditions for the two assays were identical, except that the autophosphorylation assays contained 0.25 mm[γ- 32P]ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stimulation of Dictyostelium MIHCK with a combination of PS and GTPγS-Rac1 resulted in the same level of phosphate incorporation (9–10 mol of phosphate/mol) as was obtained with PS or GTPγS-Rac1 separately. The lack of additive phosphorylation suggests that GTPγS-Rac1 and PS promote the phosphorylation of a similar set of sites. Consistent with this view, tryptic digests of MIHCK autophosphorylated in the presence of PS, GTPγS-Rac1, or a combination of PS and GTPγS-Rac1 yielded qualitatively similar two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps (Fig. 1). The pattern of the major phosphorylated peptides, including the phosphopeptide representing RVSMMR (Fig. 1, 1) were indistinguishable, except for two phosphopeptides (Fig. 1, 2 and 3) that were detected with GTPγS-Rac1 activation but not with PS activation. These two peptides were also apparent when MIHCK was autophosphorylated in the presence of PS and GTPγS-Rac1 (Fig. 1). Phosphorylation assays with peptide substrates showed that PS and GTPγS-Rac1 were independently able to fully stimulate the kin"

We demonstrate that exogenous β2-microglobulin (β2m) stabilizes human cell surface MHC I molecules and facilitates their loading with exogenous peptides. Additionally, using three-dimensional crystal structures and known interaction sites between MHC I heavy chains and β2m, we engineered variants of human β2m (hβ2m) with a single serine substitution at residue 55. This alteration was predicted to promote hydrophobic interactions at the MHC I heavy chain/β2m interface and displace an ordered water molecule. Compared with hβ2m, the serine to valine substitution at residue 55 had improved ability to bind to cell surface HLA-A1, HLA-A2, and HLA-A3 molecules, facilitate exogenous peptide loading, and promote recognition by peptide-specific T cells. The inclusion of hβ2m or higher affinity variants when pulsing cells with MHC-restricted peptides increases the efficiency of peptide loading 50–80-fold. Therefore, the inclusion of hβ2m in peptide-based vaccines may increase cell surface antigen densities above thresholds that allow recognition of peptide antigens by the immune system, particularly for cryptic, subdominant, or marginally antigenic peptides.

In the field of vaccine development, it has been relatively simple to induce humoral responses to injected antigens. However, one of the major challenges in the treatment of tumors and viral infections is the generation of vaccines that stimulate cell-mediated immune responses to these pathogens. Specific cytolytic responses are generally mediated by CD8+ T cell recognition of antigenic peptides in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)1 class I molecules.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 4458-4467PubMed Google Scholar) will undoubtedly have a significant impact on realizing these goals. However, beyond defining appropriate antigenic peptides, a second challenge lies in establishing effective methods with which to deliver these antigens to the MHC I loading pathway. Typically, MHC I molecules acquire peptides generated by the degradation of endogenous proteins by the proteasome. These peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum, where they are bound by MHC I·β2-microglobulin (β2m) complexes and finally transit to the cell surface (10Germain R.N. Margulies D.H. Paul W.P. Fathman C.G. Metzger H. Annual Review of Immunology. 11. Annual Reviews Inc., Palo Alto, CA1993: 402-450Google Scholar, 11Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Adv.

Although this pathway is the dominant means of loading MHC I molecules, other methods of delivering antigenic peptides to MHC I have been described including direct incorporation of DNA into cells (13Montgomery D.L.

Immunol. 1995; 42: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All of these approaches attempt to introduce peptide into the endogenous loading pathway. Alternatively, direct cell surface loading of MHC I moleculesin vitro has also been demonstrated but is inefficient in the absence of serum (22Vitiello A. Potter T.A. Sherman L.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1423-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23Kozlowski S. Takeshita T. Boehncke W.H. Takahashi H. Boyd L.F. Germain R.N. Berzofsky J.A. Margulies D.H. Nature. 1991; 349: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, peptide antigens can be bound to MHC I molecules, but they must either be introduced into the endogenous pathway or be loaded exogenously. Some active and approved clinical trials involve the direct injection of free peptide (usually in an oil-based adjuvant) into patients to induce cell-mediated immunity (e.g. Protocol ID numbers NCI-95-C-0145D, NCI-T95-0031N, NCI-95-C-0143B, NCI-T95-0039N, MSKCC-95052, NCI-H95-0769, LAC-USC-10M954, NCI-T95-0069D, NCI-97-C-0141, NCI-T96-0078, NCI-98-C-0023, NCI-98-C-0022, 94-C-0159). 2Available on the World Wide Web athttp://cancernet.nci.nih.gov/ prot/menu/dx01302.html.2Available on the World Wide Web athttp://cancernet.nci.nih.gov/ prot/menu/dx01302.html. The most likely mechanism for the formation of peptide-MHC I complexes in these cases is the exogenous binding of free peptide to cell surface MHC I molecules. Successful exogenous loading requires that added peptides bind to cell surface MHC I molecules by exchange of their endogenously derived peptides. Since MHC I molecules that have lost their endogenously loaded peptides are inherently unstable (24Ljunggren H.G. Stam N.J. Ohlen C. Neefjes J.J. Hoglund P. Heemels M.T. Bastin J. Schumacher T.N. Townsend A. Karre K. Plough H. Nature. 1990; 346: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), efficient loading of exogenous peptide presents a significant challenge. We, as well as others, have demonstrated that empty MHC I molecules can be stabilized with exogenous human β2m (hβ2m) (23Kozlowski S. Takeshita T. Boehncke W.H. Takahashi H. Boyd L.F. Germain R.N. Berzofsky J.A. Margulies D.H. Nature. 1991; 349: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Otten G.R. Bikoff E. Ribaudo R.K. Kozlowski S. Margulies D.H. Germain R.N. J.

Thus, the generation of higher affinity variants of β2m could both quantitatively and qualitatively affect the efficiency of exogenous peptide loading by increasing both the amount of peptide loaded as well as the length of time that the peptide remains bound. These qualitative and quantitative effects may allow the immune system to generate cellular responses to lower affinity peptides. Responses to lower affinity antigens may in turn lead to recognition and destruction of neoplastic or virally infected cells that would otherwise be below the threshold of recognition by the immune system. Site-directed mutagenesis of MHC I heavy chains has identified residues that affect peptide association, T cell recognition, and stability with β2m (27Abastado J.P. Casrouge A. Kourilsky P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3569-3575PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jaulin C. Romero P. Luescher I.F. Casanova J.L. Prochnicka-Chalufour A. Langlade-Demoyen P. Maryanski J.L. Kourilsky P. Int.

Additionally, a great deal of work has been done identifying, analyzing, and modifying peptides bound to MHC molecules. In contrast, however, much less work has been done engineering and comparing different β2m molecules, with a few notable exceptions comparing murine with human β2m and mutagenizing hβ2m (26Shields M.J.

Achilles S. Zeff R. Wei T. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Further, comparisons of hβ2m and murine β2m (mβ2m) reveal that hβ2m binds with higher affinity to murine MHC I heavy chains than mβ2m (31Pedersen L.O. Stryhn A. Holter T.L. Etzerodt M. Gerwien J. Nissen M.H. Thogersen H.C. Buus S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1609-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and we have identified a region of hβ2m (the S5 strand) responsible in part for this effect (26Shields M.J. Assefi N.P. Hodgson W. Kim E.J. Ribaudo R.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2297-2307PubMed Google Scholar). Using this information and the available three-dimensional crystal structures of MHC I molecules, we engineered a variant of hβ2m to create an ionic bond that stabilized interactions with the murine MHC I heavy chain H-2Dd to a greater extent than wild-type hβ2m (26Shields M.J. Assefi N.P. Hodgson W. Kim E.J. Ribaudo R.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2297-2307PubMed Google Scholar). We have now extended this work to human MHC I molecules. In this report we have utilized four independent means to compare variant hβ2m molecules: 1) an assay in which exogenous β2m and peptide stabilize cell surface MHC molecules that have been stripped of their endogenous β2m and peptide (36Bremers A.J. van der Burg S.H.

Benckhuijsen W.E. Bremers A.J. Melief C.J. Kast W.M. Hum. Immunol. 1995; 44: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); 2) an inhibition assay we have developed that directly compares the ability of different β2m species to bind to cell surface MHC molecules; 3) direct peptide binding to MHC I molecules using a FITC-labeled peptide; and 4) a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lysis assay, which indirectly measures the loading of antigenic peptides onto target cells based on the lysis of those target cells by CTL clones. We have engineered a higher affinity variant of hβ2m that, by the above criteria, stabilizes human MHC I molecules to a greater extent than wild-type hβ2m, enhances peptide binding, and enhances the ability of CTL to recognize peptide-loaded target cells. Further, this stabilizing activity was observed with all three HLA alleles examined: HLA-A1, HLA-A2, and HLA-A3. hβ2m cDNA in Bluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was mutated using the ExSite mutagenesis system (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol and subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET-21d(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) using engineered NcoI and BamHI sites at the 5′- and 3′-end of the mature protein sequence, respectively. The D53 variants were described previously (26Shields M.J. Assefi N.P. Hodgson W. Kim E.J. Ribaudo R.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2297-2307PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for the S55 mutagenesis were as follows: sense S55I, 5′-ATT TTC AGC AAG GAC TGG TCT TTC-3′; sense S55V, 5′-GTG TTC AGC AAG GAC TGG TCT TTC-3′; common antisense, 5′-TAA GTC TGA ATG CTC CAC TTT TTC-3′. The oligonucleotides used for the insertion of the 9E10 epitope (amino acid sequence EQKLISEEDLN) at the amino terminus of wild-type β2m to create the myc-β2m were as follows: sense myc, 5′-TCC GAG GAG GAC CTG AAC ATC CAG CGT ACT CCA AAG ATT CAG G-3′; Antisense myc, 5′-AAT AAG CTT CTG CTC CAT GGC CTC GAG GCC AGA AAG AGA GAG-3′. Mutagenized or added regions are underlined. Constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis using standard techniques. Recombinant β2m expression and purification has been described previously (26Shields M.J. Assefi N.P. Hodgson W. Kim E.J. Ribaudo R.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2297-2307PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, β2m constructs in pET-21d(+) were transformed into the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli. At an A 600 of 0.6, cultures were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, and inclusion bodies were isolated by centrifugation after sonication of bacteria in 200 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 10% Triton X-100, pH 7.6, and washing in 200 mm Tris, 2 mmEDTA, pH 7.6. Inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 mguanidine HCl containing 0.3 m dithiothreitol, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1% aprotinin). Following overnight dialysis in 6 m guanidine, pH 2.0, recombinant protein was refolded over 72 h in 0.4 m arginine, 5 mm oxidized glutathione, 100 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA at 10 °C. Following refolding, preparations were dialyzed exhaustively against 0.4 m arginine, 100 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and then PBS at 4 °C. Preparations were purified as a single peak by preparative fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superdex 75pg gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), concentrated using Centriprep-3 concentrating units (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and sterile-filtered, and concentrations were calculated based on A 280 readings. Recombinant β2m was judged to be ≥95% pure based on analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analytical fast protein liquid chromatography. Independent preparations have been compared for specific activity and shown to be identical at a molar level with no loss in activity when stored at −70 °C for >6 months and at 4 °C for >2 months. Recombinant hβ2m was also shown to be identical in activity to native hβ2m purified from urine (Sigma) (38Shields M.J. Ribaudo R.K.

Hmy2.C1R cells transfected with HLA-A2 or HLA-A3 were resuspended to 4 × 106 cells/ml in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 μm BATD (which forms a fluorescent chelate with Europium; Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD) and incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of serum-free (SF) CTL medium (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine, 1.25 mm sulfinpyrazone (Sigma), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin), centrifuged, and washed once more with SF CTL medium. Cells were then pulsed with peptide with or without β2m in SF CTL medium for 60–90 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice in SF CTL medium, resuspended in CTL medium (5% fetal calf serum in lieu of BSA), and combined at the designated effector:target ratio with CTL clones in round bottom microtiter plates. Plates were gently centrifuged at 100 × g for 2 min and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Finally, plates were centrifuged at 300 × g, and 20 μl/well was transferred to 200 μl of 0.3 m acetic acid, 60 mm sodium acetate, 7.5 μg/ml Europium (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI), and the plate was read on a Wallac 1234 DELFIA fluorometer. The percentage of specific lysis was calculated with the following equation: 100 × ((experimental − blank) − (spontaneous − blank))/((maximum − blank) − (spontaneous − blank)). Triplicate samples were used, and error bars indicate S.D. values. Hmy2.C1R-A2 cells were resuspended in SF IMDM (IMDM supplemented with 2.5 mg/ml BSA, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.04 mg/ml Gentamicin sulfate) with the indicated concentrations of peptide with or without recombinant β2m and incubated at 37 °C for 17 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS plus 2 mg/ml BSA (PBSA) and resuspended in PBSA followed by flow cytometric analysis on a FACS analyzer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). 8000–20,000 live (propidium iodide-excluding) events were collected per sample, and values are expressed as mean fluorescence intensity. ED50 values were calculated using a sigmoid logistic fit. The MHC stabilization was done essentially as described previously (36Bremers A.J. van der Burg S.H. Kuppen P.J. Kast W.M. van de Velde C.J.

Briefly, Hmy2.C1R-A1, -A2, and -A3 cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 0.13m citric acid, 66 mmNa2HPO4, pH 2.9 (pH 3.2 for A2 cells), for 90 s at 4 °C, washed with two 50-ml changes of IMDM, and resuspended in SF IMDM. 105 cells/well were added to a 96-well microtiter plate containing hybridoma supernatants, peptide, and β2m dilutions in a total volume of 150 μl. After a 4-h incubation at 23 °C, cells were washed twice with PBS, 2 mg/ml BSA, 0.02% NaN3 (FACS buffer) and stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) F(ab′)2fragment (Cappel/Organon Teknika, Durham, NC) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and fixed in 1% formaldehyde in PBS followed by flow cytometric analysis on a FACScan II (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Values are expressed as mean fluorescence intensity. Hmy2.C1R transfectant cells at 2.5 × 105 cells/tube in a 500-μl volume were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h in SF IMDM with different concentrations of myc-β2m with or without peptide. Cells were washed three times in plain IMDM followed by incubation with 9E10 (anti-myc) hybridoma supernatant at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing with IMDM, cells were stained for 1 h with FITC anti-mouse IgG at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed a final time in FACS buffer, and live cells (propidium iodide-excluding) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The inhibition assay is identical to the binding assay with the following modifications: 2.5 μm myc-β2m was used in all cases, and different concentrations of non-myc-labeled recombinant β2m were included to inhibit myc-β2m binding to cell surface MHC molecules. The percentage of inhibition was calculated by the following equation: (1 − ((experimental − background)/(no inhibitor − background))) × 100. 10,000–20,000 gated events/sample were counted, and all experiments were repeated at least twice. ID50 values were calculated using a sigmoid logistic fit. The effectiveness of β2m in facilitating exogenous peptide loading of MHC I molecules was measured using a CTL lysis assay. Target cell lysis not only correlates with the loading of a specific peptide antigen, but it also demonstrates that the peptide is bound in an immunologically relevant manner. Hmy2.C1R-A2 target cells (a human lymphoblastoid cell essentially null for HLA molecules except for the transfected HLA-A2.1) (40Winter C.C. Carreno B.M. Turner R.V. Koenig S. Biddison W.E. J.

The presence of hβ2m dramatically increased the specific lysis by the TAX-specific CTL clone in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1). Lysis at the maximal amount of hβ2m in the presence of an irrelevant A2-binding peptide was at background levels. Using this suboptimal concentration of peptide, there was 20% lysis in the absence of β2m. The addition of 8 μm β2m increased the lysis to the maximum observed at this effector:target ratio. In the absence of β2m, a 50–100-fold higher concentration of peptide would be required to achieve comparable levels of lysis. 3M. J. Shields, unpublished observations. To directly demonstrate the effectiveness of hβ2m to enhance peptide loading of MHC I molecules, we measured the binding of a FITC-labeled, HLA-A2-restricted peptide (HIV RT 195–207) to Hmy2.C1R-A2 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the presence of hβ2m shifted the peptide titration curve approximately 50-fold compared with peptide loading in the absence of hβ2m, consistent with the magnitude of shift observed for the augmentation of CTL lysis. Based on previous work, the region of hβ2m including the S5 strand was found to play an important role in the higher affinity of hβ2m for murine MHC I heavy chains (26Shields M.J. Assefi N.P. Hodgson W. Kim E.J. Ribaudo R.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2297-2307PubMed Google Scholar) and was the focus of our structural search for mutations to increase the affinity of hβ2m. Using the HLA-A2 crystal structure (52Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C.

This residue was substituted with hydrophobic residues of increasing mass (valine and isoleucine) in order to promote hydrophobic interactions and exclude the ordered water. The valine side chain was chosen, since it is approximately the volume of a serine side chain hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule. Serine 55 was also changed to isoleucine, since it was unclear if and how the hydrophobic residues would pack in relation to other side chains at the hβ2m/heavy chain interface. We initially used an HLA stabilization assay (36Bremers A.J. van der Burg S.H. Kuppen P.J. Kast W.M. van de Velde C.J. Melief C.J. J. Immunother.

Since there can be significant allele-specific differences in the ability of hβ2m point mutants to stabilize murine heavy chains3 (26Shields M.J. Assefi N.P. Hodgson W. Kim E.J. Ribaudo R.K. J.

Fig. 3 demonstrates the ability of the S55 substituted β2ms to stabilize HLA-A1 (Fig. 3 a), HLA-A2 (Fig. 3 b), and HLA-A3 (Fig. 3,c and d) in the presence of a specific binding peptide and an appropriate HLA-specific antibody.

S., Freyzon, Y., and Trybus, K. M. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 30260–30263). The present study determined whether this loss of regulation is due to the greater positive charge density (5versus 3 clustered lysine residues) or lesser length (14versus 26 residues) of the mutant ABL. Charge augmentation had little effect on regulation of expressed mutants, but elimination of the 12 N-terminal amino acids from the wild-type ABL significantly increased actin-activated ATPase activity of the dephosphorylated relative to the phosphorylated molecule while conferring the ability to move actin filaments in vitro on the former. Addition of the same 12 residues to the SABL mutant increased the ratio of phosphorylated to dephosphorylated ATPase activity while imparting wild type-like regulation to motility. However, full actin activation of dephosphorylated ATPase activity required both the shorter length and greater positive charge density found in the SABL loop. These results demonstrate that, compared with skeletal, both the greater length and lesser positive charge density of the smooth muscle myosin ABL are required for proper phosphorylation-mediated regulation of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2132251153,"It is unknown whether the endocytosis-independent transfer of phospholipids from lipoproteins to platelets is regulated by platelet agonists such as thrombin. The movements of the choline phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin (labeled with either 14C or the fluorescent pyrenedecanoic acid) between low density lipoproteins and platelets were unaffected by thrombin (0.5 unit/ml). In contrast, thrombin accelerated the import of diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and alkenylacyl phosphatidylethanolamine into platelets by about 4-fold. Similarly, thrombin receptor-activating peptide (15 microM), collagen (10 microgram/ml), and ADP (10 microM) enhanced PE uptake. High density lipoprotein particles and egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles were also donors for stimulation of platelet PE import. Part of the [14C]arachidonic acid-labeled PE transferred from low density lipoprotein to platelets activated by thrombin and collagen was metabolized to 14C-eicosanoids. Inhibitors of protein kinase C partially prevented thrombin-induced [14C]PE uptake, while direct activators of protein kinase C increased incorporation of [14C]PE into platelets. Proteinaceous factor(s) recovered in the extracellular medium from ADP- and thrombin-activated platelet suspensions were found to accelerate the transfer of pyrenedecanoic acid-labeled PE between donor and acceptor lipid vesicles. The stimulation of import of ethanolamine phospholipids led to a 2-fold enhancement of the prothrombinase activity of thrombin-activated platelets. Our study demonstrates that physiological platelet stimuli increase specifically the transfer of ethanolamine phospholipids from lipoproteins to platelets through a secretion-dependent mechanism. This might contribute to the increase of procoagulant activity of stimulated platelets."

We have defined a novel cytoplasmic motif in human CD22 that controls its unusually rapid turnover at the plasma membrane. Chimeric and mutated CD22α cDNA vectors were constructed and stably transfected in CD22-negative Jurkat T-lymphocytic cells. Two assays were employed to measure CD22α internalization: first, cytoplasmic uptake of radioiodinated anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody; and second, lethal targeting of a toxin, saporin, into cells via CD22 using bispecific F(ab′)2([anti-CD22 × anti-saporin]) antibody. Results showed that CD22α lacking a cytoplasmic tail was not internalized and that replacement of the cytoplasmic tail of CD19 with that of CD22α resulted in a chimeric molecule that behaved like CD22α and internalized rapidly. Step-wise deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of CD22α located the internalization motif to a polar region of 11 residues (QRRWKRTQSQQ) proximal to the plasma membrane, a part of the molecule predicted to form a coil or turn structure. Interestingly, additional CD22 mutants showed that the two glutamine residues sandwiching the serine are critical to internalization but that the serine itself is not.

Although the nature of the CD22 ligand(s) is not fully defined, it is known to bind sialoglycoconjugate NeuAcα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAc, which is widely distributed onN-linked carbohydrates (3Powell L.D.

The principal function of CD22 is to regulate B-cell responses, which is probably achieved by recruiting key signaling molecules to the antigen receptor complex (5Pezzutto A. Rabinovitch P.S. Dorken B. Moldenhauer G. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1791-1795PubMed Google Scholar,6Peaker C.J.G. Neuberger M.S. Eur. J.

The cytoplasmic domain is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated upon ligation of the B-cell antigen receptor and associates with a range of intracellular signaling molecules that includes tyrosine phosphatase SH2-domain containing tyrosine phosphatase-1, tyrosine kinases Lck and Syk, phospholipase C-γ1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (1Tedder T.F.

The importance of CD22 in modulating B-cell responses has recently been confirmed in knockout mice, which show augmented antibody responses, expanded peritoneal B-1 cell populations, and increased levels of circulating autoantibodies (8O'Keefe T.L.

Nature. 1990; 344: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 12Wilson G.L. Fox C.H. Fauci A.S. Kehrl J. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A larger species, CD22β, which has seven extracellular Ig-like domains and a cytoplasmic domain containing 141 amino acids, and a smaller isoform, CD22α, which has five extracellular Ig-like domains (domains 3 and 4 are deleted) and a cytoplasmic region that is 23 amino acids shorter than that of CD22β. Although CD22β is by far the predominant species, and the only form identified in mouse, a smaller immunoprecipitate has been found that may correspond to the CD22α in human (13Schwartz-Albiez R. Dorken B. Monner D.A. Moldenhauer G. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both isoforms contain tyrosine residues in their cytoplasmic tails, 3 residues in the α form and 6 in the β form. Most of these tyrosine residues are arranged to form immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIM), consisting of a 6-amino acid stretch with the consensus sequence (I/L/V)XYXX(L/V), and/or potential immunoreceptor tyrosine-base activation motifs (ITAM) (12Wilson G.L.

In addition, CD22 contains a YXXM sequence recognized by the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Thus, CD22 has the capacity to modulate B-cell behavior via a wide range of intracellular, tyrosine-dependant signaling molecules. In addition to any signaling role, CD22 shows an unusual and unexplained capability to internalize rapidly from the cell surface to the cytoplasm. Recent studies have shown that CD22 internalizes constitutively on unstimulated B-cell lines, and this is followed by degradation without detectable recycling (17Shan D. Press O.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4466-4475PubMed Google Scholar). This internalization probably explains, at least in part, the success achieved when CD22 has been employed as a target molecule for delivering toxins into neoplastic B-cells using antibody immunotoxins (18Ghetie M.A. May R.D.

In the present study, we have investigated the molecular structure of the cytoplasmic domain of CD22 and identified a new motif that controls its internalization from the cell surface and may account for its unusual immunotherapeutic properties. The Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Daudi and the acute T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat were used in these studies. Both lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/ml benzyl penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cells were maintained continuously in the logarithmic phase of growth by passage at regular intervals. The mAbs used in this study include anti-CD19 (RFB9) (20Bonardi M.A. French R.R. Amlot P.

Hybridoma cells were expanded in stationary culture using 5% supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and IgG purified using protein A affinity chromatography as described previously (26Glennie M.J. Tutt A.L. Greenman J. Gallagher G. Rees R.C. Reynolds C.W. Tumour Immunobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 225-244Google Scholar). Bispecific F(ab′)2 heterodimers were constructed using well established procedures in which Fab′ fragments from two different mAbs are cross-linked via their hinge region SH groups using the bis-maleimide linker o-phenylenedimaleimide (26Glennie M.J. Tutt A.L. Greenman J. Gallagher G. Rees R.C. Reynolds C.W. Tumour Immunobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 225-244Google Scholar). cDNA clones of human CD19 and CD22α were kind gifts from Dr. Brian Seed. The CD19 clone provided, which will be called CD19BS throughout this paper, is not the full-length, wild type transcript, but a truncated version that has its cytoplasmic domain reduced from the normal 242 to 148 amino acids long (27Tedder T.F. Isaacs C.M. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 712-717PubMed Google Scholar). Fortunately, for the present study we were only interested in CD19BS as a control surface protein that could be engineered into a chimeric protein containing the extracellular and transmembrane region of CD19BS and the cytoplasmic tail of CD22α. As discussed above, the CD22α molecule is a minor isoform of CD22 that may not be expressed in normal B-cells. Because of its truncated cytoplasmic domain and reduced number of tyrosines, it is likely to have a number of signaling properties that are different from those of the predominant CD22β isoform. For the purposes of this study, the membrane proximal regions of the molecule that control internalization (see under “Results”) are identical in CD22α and CD22β. Both CD19BS and CD22α cDNA clones were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) using theHindIII-NotI sites for CD19BS and theXhoI site for CD22α. Deletion of the CD22α cytoplasmic tail was accomplished by PCR using primer pairs 22αF (TTGAATCTCGAGACGCGGAAACAGGCTTGCAC) and 22αΔcytR (TCGCTAGAT CTAGAGCCCACAGATTGCCAGGA). To delete the whole cytoplasmic tail, a stop codon (TAG) was introduced after Leu510 in the transmembrane region. PCR was performed in a Protocol Thermal Cycler (AMS Biotechnology Ltd.) using CD22α full-length cDNA as template. All reagents were from the Repli-Pack kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The PCR construct generated contained both the extracellular and transmembrane domains and was then subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) for sequencing and into expression vector pcDNA3 for transfection. To replace the cytoplasmic region of CD19BS with that of CD22α, a two-step recombinant PCR strategy was used (28Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Geffand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar). In this method, a pair of chimeric PCR primers was designed to span the chimeric junctions. The 5′-half of one chimeric primer, 19/22αF (CAACGTCGCTGGAGCTTAAGATGAAGAATGCCCA), bound to the 3′-end of the transmembrane region of the antisense strand of CD19BScDNA between base pairs 939 and 954, whereas the 3′-half of the primer bound to the 5′-end of the cytoplasmic region of the antisense strand of CD22α cDNA (base pairs 1622–1638). A second chimeric primer, 19/22αR (TGGGCATTCTTCATCTTAAGCTCCAGCGACGTTG), the complimentary oligonucleotide to 19/22αF, was made so that its 5′-end bound to the sense strand of CD22α between base pairs 1622 and 1638 and the 3′-end recognized the sense strand of CD19BS between base pairs 939 and 954. Appropriate end primers, 19F (TCATCAAGCTTGGAGAGTCTGACCACCATGC) and 22αR (TCGGAGATCTCCCTGGCCCCCGCTGCCCCAG) were also designed to hybridize with the 5′-end of the antisense strand of the full-length CD19BS cDNA (base pairs 1–30) and the 3′-end of the sense strand of CD22α cDNA (base pairs 2072–2093), respectively. In the first PCR, 2 separate products corresponding to the CD19BS extracellular region and transmembrane domain (CD19BSΔcyt) and the CD22α cytoplasmic domain (CD22αcyt) were generated using the respective primer pairs of [19F + 19/22αR] and [19/22αF + 22αR]. These PCR fragments were extracted from agarose gels using Qiaex gel extraction kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), and then 100 ng of each was used in a second PCR. Initially, this reaction was carried out for 10 cycles without end primers (19F and 22αR) or DNA template. End primers were then added, and a further 10 cycles were completed to give a full-length chimeric CD19 construct with CD22 cytoplasmic region. The chimeric construct (CD19Δcyt/22αcyt) was then cloned into pGEM-T vector viaHindIII and BamHI sites for sequencing and further subcloned into eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 viaHindIII and NotI. To delete individual tyrosine residues Tyr556, Tyr566, and Tyr600, 3′ primers containing stop codons were used to amplify CD22α template with the 5′ primer 22F via PCR. This yielded deletion mutants (CD22αYΔ556, CD22αYΔ566, and CD22αYΔ600) in which stop codons replaced the respective tyrosine residues. Deletion mutants CD22αΔQ513, CD22αΔG524, and CD22αΔE527 were constructed in a similar manner using 3′ primer to respectively replace the corresponding amino acid residues with stop codons. Mutations of Ser521 to Ala521 and Gln520/Gln522 to Leu520/Leu522 were carried out using 3′ primers containing the corresponding changes in the codons. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing (Sequenase, version 2.0, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All constructs were then subcloned into pCINEO mammalian expression vector (Promega) for transfection. Jurkat cells were transfected with cDNA constructs by electroporation based on the procedure described by Andreason and Evans (29Andreason G.L. Evans G.A. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 650-660PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 106 cells were pelleted, resuspended in a total volume of 0.8 ml with RPMI, and loaded into a 4-mm electroporation cuvette together with 50 μg of DNA. After standing for 5 min on ice, cells were electroporated at 300 V, 960 microfarads using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad), and then the cuvette was returned to an ice bath for a further 10 min without mixing. The cells were then left at room temperature for 10 min before adding 30 ml of complete RPMI medium. For the next 48–72 h, the cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks under standard conditions at 37 °C in a moist atmosphere of 5% CO2 before being transferred to 96-well plates in complete medium containing 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Emerging colonies were tested for surface expression by flow cytometry (described previously; Ref. 24Ellis J.H. Barber K.A. Tutt A. Hale C. Lewis A.P. Glennie M.J. Stevenson G.T. Crowe J.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 925-937PubMed Google Scholar) after 3–4 weeks, and positive cells were cloned by limiting dilution. Anti-CD19 and -CD22 mAbs were trace radiolabeled using carrier free 125I (Radiochemical Center, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and IODO-BEADS (Pierce) as oxidizing reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. The radioimmunoassays for evaluating surface binding and internalization of the 125I-labeled mAbs were carried out by a method based on that described by Pelchen-Mattews et al. (30Pelchen-Mattews A. Armes J.E. Griffiths G. Marsh M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 578-587Google Scholar). Cells (107/ml) were incubated with 125I-labeled mAb (2 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h to allow binding and then warmed to 37 °C to allow internalization. Aliquots were taken at various intervals, washed twice in 10% supplemented RPMI medium before centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 45 s through a cold solution of 5% bovine serum albumin (in phosphate-buffered saline) and counting the radioactivity bound to the pellet. For the internalized count, the medium in the second wash was replaced by a HCl-titrated buffered RPMI medium (pH2.0), which removes surface bound activity and thus allows the internalized125I-antibodies to be measured and surface binding estimated by subtraction of the internalization counts from the total counts. We have established that a BsAb that is designed to recognize a toxin, such as saporin, and a suitable cell surface molecule will target the toxin to the cells and allow efficient internalization so that the cells are killed. Protein synthesis levels in target cells exposed to BsAb·saporin complexes were assessed by measuring incorporation of [3H]leucine uptake according to methods described previously (20Bonardi M.A. French R.R. Amlot P. Gromo G. Modena D. Glennie M.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3015-3021PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected Jurkat cells (1 × 105/well) were cultured for 24 h in 96-well, flat-bottomed plates with 200 μl of leucine-free RPMI medium containing 1 μg/ml BsAb and the required concentration of saporin. Each well was then pulsed with [3H]leucine (1 μCi/well) for 16 h, and the incorporation of radioactivity into protein was assessed by harvesting the cells onto glass fibers, washing, and counting. Throughout the work, a mixture of two BsAbs was used as described previously (25French R.R. Courtenay A.E. Ingamells S. Stevenson G.T. Glennie M.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2353-2361PubMed Google Scholar). Each pair of reagents was selected to bind to the cell via a single epitope on CD19, CD22, or CD38 and to the saporin via two different epitopes. This maneuver allows the BsAb·saporin complexes to be captured bivalently and, due to their increased avidity, bind 20 times more avidly to the target cells than with a single BsAb (25French R.R. Courtenay A.E. Ingamells S. Stevenson G.T. Glennie M.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2353-2361PubMed Google Scholar). We decided to investigate the molecular basis of CD22α internalization and in particular the structural features of the cytoplasmic tail that control delivery into the cell. Our strategy was to construct a panel of CD22α cDNA containing vectors in which the cytoplasmic tail of CD22α had been selectively altered. These vectors were used to make stable tranfectants of CD22-negative Jurkat cells, which were then investigated, after cloning, for their ability to internalize the newly expressed CD22α. Details of all the constructs in this investigation are shown in Fig. 1. A total of 12 cDNA constructs were made, including molecules in which the cytoplasmic tail of CD22α was spliced onto the extracellular and transmembrane region of CD19 (CD19Δcyt/22αcyt), together with a range of CD22α mutants containing truncated cytoplasmic tails and molecules in which certain amino acids were changed. The Jurkat T-cell leukemia line was chosen as a suitable CD22-negative lymphoid cell line in which to express these molecules. Jurkat cells were stably transfected and then screened by flow cytometry to isolate clones that expressed the various mutated CD22α molecules. As shown in Fig. 2, both wild type CD19BS (Fig. 2 A) and CD22α (Fig. 2 C) were expressed at easily detectable levels, showing that neither surface B-cell marker required associated B-cell restricted molecules for their expression. The CD22α clone was employed as a positive control for assessing CD22α internalization throughout the remainder of this investigation, whereas CD19BS Jurkat cells provided our negative controls (see below). Fig. 2 also shows the levels of mutated CD22α expression for the other transfectants. With the exception of one clone, CD22αΔcyt (Fig. 2 J), which gave only weak immunofluorescence staining, relative to other transfectants, all cells expressed levels of surface CD22α that were as high as or even higher than that of CD22β generally expressed on normal B-cells and B-cell lines (data not shown). The expression of all the constructs was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation of Nonidet P-40 lysates of the radioiodinated transfectants (results not shown). To investigate whether the cytoplasmic tail of CD22α controlled its internalization, we compared the uptake of 125I-labeled mAbs by Daudi cells and by Jurkat cells transfected with CD22α, CD22αΔcyt, CD19BS, and CD19Δcyt/22αcyt (Fig. 3). Cells were incubated with radiolabeled anti-CD22 or anti-CD19 mAb for 1 h at 4 °C and then warmed to 37 °C for various intervals. The cells were then acid-washed to remove surface bound mAb, and therefore, any increase in the cell-associated radioactivity must be due to the endocytosis of the antigen-antibody complex. The results show that both Daudi cells (CD22β+) and CD22α-expressing Jurkat cells accumulated125I-labeled anti-CD22 mAb at a similar rate (Fig. 3 A). There was a sharp initial uptake of mAb in the first 2 h, after which the level remained quite steady. The accumulation of intracellular 125I-labeled mAb by these cells was accompanied by a corresponding loss of surface-associated mAb. In contrast, the Jurkat cells expressing the CD22αΔcyt, in which the cytoplasmic region of the molecule had been removed (Fig. 1), were unable to accumulate significant levels of intracelluar radiolabel, and the mAb remained on the surface of the cells. This result is consistent with the cytoplasmic tail playing a central role in CD22α turnover at the cell surface and with immunoelectron microscopy data that showed that CD22α is strongly clustered around coated pits in transfected Jurkat cells but that following removal of the cytoplasmic tail the truncated molecules are evenly distributed along the plasma membrane (data not shown). The importance of the CD22α cytoplasmic tail in mediating internalization was confirmed using cells expressing the chimeric CD19Δcyt/22αcyt molecule in which the CD22α cytoplasmic tail had been grafted onto the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD19BS (Fig. 3 B). Whereas CD19 (endogenous expression on Daudi cells) and CD19BS (transfected Jurkat) were relatively poor at taking up radioiodinated anti-CD19 mAb, once the cytoplasmic tail of CD19BS was replaced by that of CD22α, it behaved like the intact CD22α and internalized mAb very effectively. In fact, for reasons that are not understood, uptake of125I-labeled mAb by this chimeric molecule was quicker and more extensive than by the transfected CD22α. These results suggest that there is an internalization signal within the cytoplasmic region of CD22α. For the next stage of this investigation we used the Jurkat transfectants as target cells in an assay which measures the cytotoxicity of a toxin, saporin, when delivered to the cells via CD19BS or CD22α. In the assay, cells are exposed to a BsAb ([anti-CD22 × anti-saporin] or [anti-CD19 × anti-saporin]) at 1 μg/ml together with saporin at various concentrations for 24 h at 37 °C, during which period the BsAb·saporin complexes are taken up by the transfectants according to the readiness of the target antigen (CD22α or CD19BS) to internalize. The cultures were then pulsed for a further 12 h with [3H]leucine to establish the level of protein synthesis in any surviving cells. As a positive control to show that all Jurkat cells, transfected or not, were sensitive to killing with BsAb·saporin complexes, we used a BsAb directed at CD38 ([anti-CD38 × anti-saporin]), which is expressed constitutively by these T-cells. Fig. 4 shows a typical set of results with transfected Jurkat cells. The CD22α molecule is highly effective at delivering BsAb·saporin complexes, giving an IC50 for saporin of approximately 2 × 10−10m, a value close to that achieved with the anti-CD38 BsAb. This showed that saporin delivered by both anti-CD22 and anti-CD38 BsAbs was approximately 2500-fold more toxic than saporin alone (5 × 10−7m). The increase in the toxicity of CD22-specific BsAbs on the CD22α-transfected Jurkat cells was similar to that observed when B-cell lines were treated with this reagent (20Bonardi M.A. French R.R. Amlot P. Gromo G. Modena D. Glennie M.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3015-3021PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the transfected CD22α molecules behave similarly to native CD22β on B-cells. In contrast, when the tail of CD22α was removed and the truncated molecule expressed in the CD22αΔcyt-transfected cells, then the same anti-CD22 BsAb was completely unable to increase saporin toxicity. This result is important because it is consistent with the internalization data shown in Fig. 3 and shows that the rate at which a molecule is internalized from the cell surface is a key feature in determining whether it will make an effective target for antibody delivery of toxins. In Fig. 4, we also see that the cytoplasmic tail of CD22 will transform CD19BS, a molecule that is unable to deliver saporin with BsAb (20Bonardi M.A. French R.R. Amlot P. Gromo G. Modena D. Glennie M.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3015-3021PubMed Google Scholar) into a useful vehicle for delivering BsAb·saporin complexes for cytotoxicity. Thus, whereas Jurkat cells expressing CD19BS were not susceptible to anti-CD19-specific BsAb·saporin complexes, those carrying CD19Δcyt/22αcyt were hypersensitive, with an IC50 for saporin that was below 10−11m. To investigate whether the cytoplasmic tail tyrosine residues of CD22α are involved in the internalization, CD22α-mutants were constructed in which the cytoplasmic tail was truncated fractionally by introducing a stop codon at the tyrosine residues (CD22αΔY556, CD22αΔY566, and CD22αΔY600) using PCR-directed mutagenesis. The three constructs were expressed at a high level in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2). Cytotoxicity assays showed that these truncated CD22α molecules were all equally as good as the unmutated CD22α at delivering BsAb·saporin complexes into the cells (Fig. 1), showing that the carboxyl-terminal end of the cytoplasmic tail is not directly involved in the internalization motif. The results using tyrosine mutants described above suggested that the region of cytoplasmic tail nearer to the cell membrane might be critical in the endocytosis process. Crystallographic work (31Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A.

Cell. 1991; 67: 1203-1209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) suggest that a tight-turn structural motif is involved in the clustering signals for surface molecules, and individual specificity is conferred by side-chain differences. It is thus interesting to note that two tight-turn structures are predicted near to the membrane within the CD22α cytoplasmic tail (Gln513–Gln523 and As"

The results indicate that the first 11 residues are nonessential for folding to the active conformation, but they are necessary for attaining an active, stable structure when expressed in Escherichia coli. Rhodanese species with up to 9 residues deleted were expressed and purified. Kinetic parameters for the mutants were similar to those of the full-length enzyme. Compared with shorter truncations, mutants missing 7 or 9 residues were (a) increasingly inactivated by urea denaturation, (b) more susceptible to inactivation by dithiothreitol, (c) less able to be reactivated, and (d) less rapidly inactivated by incubation at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitation showed that mutants lacking 10–23 NH2-terminal amino acids were expressed as inactive species of the expected size but were rapidly eliminated. Cell-free transcription/translation at 37 °C showed mutants deleted through residue 9 were enzymatically active, but they were inactive when deleted further, just as in vivo. However, at 30 °Cin vitro, both Δ1–10 and Δ1–11 showed considerable activity. Truncations in the NH2 terminus affect the chemical stability of the distantly located active site.

The enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase, EC2.8.1.1) catalyzes in vitro the transfer of sulfur from thiosulfate to a number of acceptors including cyanide, lipoic acid, or dithiothreitol (1Ploegman J.H.

The protein is imported into the matrix of the mitochondrion from its site of translation in the cytosol without proteolytic processing of its NH2 terminus (2Boggaram V. Horowitz P. Waterman M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Rhodanese has become an important model for studying issues related to the problems of protein folding (3Horowitz P.M. Himmel M.E.A.G., G. Biocatalyst Design for Stability and Specificity. 5th Ed. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1993: 167-172Google Scholar, 4Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13587-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This monomeric protein is folded into two similar independent, equal-sized domains. The NH2-terminal sequence of rhodanese is located primarily on the surface of the NH2-terminal domain of the protein (1Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L.

Residues Val-1 to Gln-3 appear to be flexible, since they are poorly resolved in the x-ray structure. Residues Val-4 to Arg-7 are fixed to the surface of the NH2 domain. Residues Ala-8 to Val-10 contribute one of five strands of a β-sheet that runs into the interior of the NH2 domain, and residues Ser-11 to Gly-22 form one of five α-helices that surround the β-sheet. The residue Lys-23 starts a turn into the interior of the NH2 domain. All of the residues required for catalysis, including the essential Cys-247, are on the C-terminal domain. In one view then, the C-terminal domain may be active alone. This has never been observed, and it has not been possible to produce stable COOH-terminal domains either proteolytically or recombinantly. Rhodanese offers a unique opportunity to investigate the influence of the NH2-terminal portion on the activity of the enzyme.The majority of proteins imported into mitochondria have their NH2-terminal sequences removed proteolytically (7Hartl F.U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 8Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Rhodanese purified from bovine liver has the same NH2-terminal sequence as that predicted from the mRNA except it is missing the initiating methionine. This lack of proteolytic processing is unusual but not unique, however, as other mitochondrial proteins share this property, e.g., 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase and cytochrome oxidase VIc. It is unclear why certain proteins retain their NH2-terminal leader sequences. When the first 23 amino acid residues of rhodanese were fused to the NH2 terminus of dihydrofolate reductase, which is not normally found in mitochondria, the enzyme was imported (9Waltner M. Hammen P.K. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21226-21230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal sequence could be cleaved only when a mitochondrial processing peptidase cleavage site was introduced (10Waltner M. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26311-26317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the α-helical structure contained in the NH2-terminal sequence confers the structure necessary for import (11Hammen P.K. Gorenstein D.G. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8610-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Retention of the NH2-terminal sequence of rhodanese in the mature protein suggests it serves functions in addition to import.A role for the NH2-terminal sequence in stabilizing the protein has been suggested by studies with rhodanese that contained a site-directed mutation that replaced glutamic acid at position 17 with proline. The purified protein showed increased susceptibility to denaturation by urea and a decreased efficiency of refolding in vitro (12Luo G.X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10246-10251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mutant protein was stable, active, and purifiable from Escherichia coli. The E17P mutant does not directly address the role of the NH2-terminal segment in folding to a stable conformation during heterologous expression.We expressed NH2-terminal truncations of rhodanese in E. coli and in an E. coli-based, cell-free transcription/translation system to investigate contributions of the NH2-terminal segment to folding, stability, and resistance to degradation during heterologous expression. E. coli is considered particularly appropriate for rhodanese, since the bacterial cytosol provides a folding environment similar to the mitochondrial matrix (13Margulis L. Origin of Eukaryotic Cells. Yale University Press, New Haven1970: 178-207Google Scholar, 14Baltcheffsky H. Baltcheffsky M. Lee C.P. Schatz G. Dallner G. Mitochondria and Microsomes. Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Reading, MA1981: 519-540Google Scholar), and many useful recombinant proteins are produced in E. coli host cells. Full-length rhodanese is stable and active when expressed in E. coli (15Miller D.M. Delgado R. Chirgwin J.M. Hardies S.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4686-4691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that the first 9 residues of the NH2 terminus of rhodanese are nonessential for the activity or resistance to elimination of the protein expressed in E. coli. Deletions of 7 or 9 NH2-terminal residues alter the chemical stability of the isolated protein. Deletions of residues 10 and beyond resulted in loss of activity when the protein was expressed in E. coli at 37 °C. These same mutant proteins were not degraded in the cell-free system, and they were synthesized in similar quantities without degradation at either 30 or 37 °C. At 37 °C, the synthesized rhodanese was inactive when 10 or more NH2-terminal residues were removed. Expression at 30 °C, however, resulted in active protein even when 11 residues were deleted, showing that under conducive conditions rhodanese can fold to an active conformation even when the truncation extends into the first α-helix. In sum, the interactions involving the NH2-terminal sequence of rhodanese can have global effects on the protein altering the reactivity of the active site.DISCUSSIONIt has been speculated that the amino-terminal 23 residues of mitochondrial rhodanese contribute to the global stability of the folded protein. In one study, for example, an E17P mutant was active but less stable than wild-type rhodanese, a result that was suggested to be due to destabilization of the α-helix proximal to the amino terminus (12Luo G.X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10246-10251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another study, limited tryptic digestion could produce an active rhodanese in which the peptide composed of the NH2-terminal 45 residues was non-covalently bound. After denaturation, this form of the enzyme was not able to refold under conditions appropriate for reactivation of the native enzyme. These results were taken to indicate that portions of the NH2terminus are important for the folding of the enzyme to an active form (43Merrill G.A. Butler M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15611-15620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies used site-directed deletions to extend these earlier suggestions and to investigate effects including (a) the role of the NH2-terminal region of rhodanese in the expression of active enzyme, i.e., its resistance to elimination in vivo; (b) the effect on the enzyme kinetic parameters of active mutants; and (c) the stabilities of mutants that could be purified.Active rhodanese was expressed with deletions of up to the first nine residues. The crystal structure of wild-type rhodanese shows that these residues are situated parallel to, and form part of, the bi-domain interface, and they are the only residues out of the first 23 that interact hydrophobically with the carboxyl domain. These residues participate in a hydrophobic cluster that includes the following interactions: His-2 with Pro-266 and Asp-267; Leu-5 with Tyr-261, Leu-262, Gly-264, and Pro-266; Tyr-6 with Tyr-261; Ala-8 with Leu-258, Tyr-261, and Leu-262; and Leu-9 with Glu-222, Leu-258, and Leu-262. Hydrogen bonding of the first 9 residues is primarily with other residues of the NH2 domain. Tyr-6 is the only one of these that H-bonds to the carboxyl domain, and it makes two H bonds to Tyr-261. Thus, it could be expected that these residues may be important for acquisition or maintenance of the active enzyme. Interestingly, the present results show that these residues are non-essential for the enzymatically active conformation during heterologous expression in E. coli or for the development of the kinetic parameters that characterize the wild-type enzyme. However, the results do indicate that deletions through residue 9 may have pronounced effects on global stability of rhodanese.The crystal structure shows that residues 11–22 form an amphipathic α-helix that interacts hydrophobically solely with the NH2-terminal domain. In our experiments, truncations through Val-10 and beyond to Lys-23 resulted in mutant proteins that were rapidly degraded when expressed in E. coli. Deletion of the residues immediately preceding the start of the helix at S11 may destabilize the N-capping sequence region of the α-helix, which is oriented perpendicular to the bi-domain interface with the N-cap region closest to, and forming part of, the interface. Other interactions made by the α-helix are with residues in the region spanning from Ser-124 to His-138, which are also located predominately at the bi-domain interface region. Thus, it is likely that changes in the NH2-terminal sequence can perturb the global structure not only through effects on the NH2-terminal domain but also through effects on the bi-domain interface. That these effects cannot occur by direct interaction is suggested by the fact that Val-10 is >18 Å from the active site sulfhydryl group.All mutant proteins with deletions through Lys-23 were detected by immunoprecipitation as proteins of the predicted sizes (e.g., Fig. 2), indicating that removal of these residues did not result in cotranslational degradation in E. coli at 37 °C. Further, the protocol included solubilizing conditions so that it was clear that the mutants were degraded and not transferred into inclusion bodies. When degradation occurred, no discrete intermediates were observed. At 37 °C, deletions beyond residue 9 produced inactive enzyme both in vitro and in vivo, which was rapidly degraded in host cells. On the other hand, in the cell-free system, similar amounts of translated rhodanese, including Δ1–15, were observed in all experiments, indicating that lack of activity is a consequence of failure to fold completely and not due to degradation. Expression in the cell-free system at 30 °C showed that at least two more NH2-terminal residues, Val-10 and to a lesser extent Ser-11, could be removed and still permit synthesis of active enzyme. These two mutants were inactive when expressed at 37 °C in the cell-free system; yet, when they were expressed at 30 °C and then brought to 37 °C for 45 min, the proteins retained activity. This implies that truncation influences folding to the active conformation rather than stability of the native state. A late step in the folding pathway may require prior formation of the Ser-11–Gly-22 helix. Residues Val-10 and Ser-11 could be essential for stabilization of this helix at 37 °C but not at 30 °C, thus conferring the temperature-sensitive folding phenotype that was observed.The NH2-terminal sequence can modulate the unassisted and the chaperonin-assisted refolding of rhodanese in vitro(44Mendoza J.A. Horowitz P.M. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the NH2-terminal sequence binds to the body of the NH2-terminal domain late in folding, when the protein has adopted a near-native conformation (12Luo G.X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10246-10251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study suggests that if there is insufficient NH2-terminal sequence left after truncation to aid in stabilization, and if the first α-helix is perturbed, then the final step from near-native to native conformation may be blocked. The NH2-terminal sequence through its ability to bind to the chaperonin GroEL may be involved in the signal that E. coliuses in degrading rhodanese (45Kandror O. Sherman M. Rhode M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6021-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 46Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).The active site sulfhydryl group on Cys-247 is very reactive in part due to the conformation and side chain interactions in this region of the protein. Thus, Cys-247 can participate in complex reactions with other sulfhydryl groups (especially Cys-254 and Cys-263) in the protein and with reactive oxygen species (47Miller-Martini D.M. Chirgwin J.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3423-3428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Miller-Martini D.M. Hua S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

Berni R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All sulfhydryl groups are reduced in the active enzyme. The sensitivity of rhodanese to inactivation and its subsequent reactivation reflect the conformation and flexibility at the active site. This behavior is clear in the loss of activity observed at 37 °C in which the greater the truncation, the less inactivation is observed, e.g., the rates of inactivation are in the order WT>Δ1–3>Δ1–7>Δ1–9. The inactivation with the sulfur acceptor substrate, DTT, although incompletely understood, has been shown also to reflect specific interactions at the active site. The results here demonstrate that DTT inactivation is clearly influenced by the degree of truncation near the NH2 terminus. These inactivations are particularly noteworthy since activity differences are difficult to discern in the folded proteins with these truncations. Thus, events at the active site Cys-247, which is on the C-terminal domain of this 296-residue protein, are influenced by the state of the first 9 residues of the protein, thus suggesting that the effect of a local structural perturbation in the NH2-terminal domain can be transmitted to the active site.The present work supports several conclusions. Although residues Val-1—Leu-9 may be essential for mitochondrial import of rhodanese, they are not required for correct folding to the native state when the protein is expressed in E. coli, although they do affect the stability of the purified protein. The amino-proximal α-helix in bovine rhodanese contributes to folding, global stability, and resistance to degradation in addition to any function in import. The ability of the NH2-terminal sequence of rhodanese to perform these multiple functions may help to explain why it is not removed after mitochondrial import. The enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase, EC2.8.1.1) catalyzes in vitro the transfer of sulfur from thiosulfate to a number of acceptors including cyanide, lipoic acid, or dithiothreitol (1Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russell J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The protein is imported into the matrix of the mitochondrion from its site of translation in the cytosol without proteolytic processing of its NH2 terminus (2Boggaram V. Horowitz P. Waterman M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Rhodanese has become an important model for studying issues related to the problems of protein folding (3Horowitz P.M. Himmel M.E.A.G., G. Biocatalyst Design for Stability and Specificity. 5th Ed. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1993: 167-172Google Scholar, 4Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13587-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This monomeric protein is folded into two similar independent, equal-sized domains. The NH2-terminal sequence of rhodanese is located primarily on the surface of the NH2-terminal domain of the protein (1Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russell J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar,5Hol W.G. Lijk L.J. Kalk K.H. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1983; 3: 370-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gliubich F. Gazerro M. Zanotti G. Delbono S. Bombieri G. Berni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21054-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Residues Val-1 to Gln-3 appear to be flexible, since they are poorly resolved in the x-ray structure. Residues Val-4 to Arg-7 are fixed to the surface of the NH2 domain. Residues Ala-8 to Val-10 contribute one of five strands of a β-sheet that runs into the interior of the NH2 domain, and residues Ser-11 to Gly-22 form one of five α-helices that surround the β-sheet. The residue Lys-23 starts a turn into the interior of the NH2 domain. All of the residues required for catalysis, including the essential Cys-247, are on the C-terminal domain. In one view then, the C-terminal domain may be active alone. This has never been observed, and it has not been possible to produce stable COOH-terminal domains either proteolytically or recombinantly. Rhodanese offers a unique opportunity to investigate the influence of the NH2-terminal portion on the activity of the enzyme. The majority of proteins imported into mitochondria have their NH2-terminal sequences removed proteolytically (7Hartl F.U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 8Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Rhodanese purified from bovine liver has the same NH2-terminal sequence as that predicted from the mRNA except it is missing the initiating methionine. This lack of proteolytic processing is unusual but not unique, however, as other mitochondrial proteins share this property, e.g., 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase and cytochrome oxidase VIc. It is unclear why certain proteins retain their NH2-terminal leader sequences. When the first 23 amino acid residues of rhodanese were fused to the NH2 terminus of dihydrofolate reductase, which is not normally found in mitochondria, the enzyme was imported (9Waltner M. Hammen P.K. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21226-21230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal sequence could be cleaved only when a mitochondrial processing peptidase cleavage site was introduced (10Waltner M. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26311-26317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the α-helical structure contained in the NH2-terminal sequence confers the structure necessary for import (11Hammen P.K. Gorenstein D.G. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8610-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Retention of the NH2-terminal sequence of rhodanese in the mature protein suggests it serves functions in addition to import. A role for the NH2-terminal sequence in stabilizing the protein has been suggested by studies with rhodanese that contained a site-directed mutation that replaced glutamic acid at position 17 with proline. The purified protein showed increased susceptibility to denaturation by urea and a decreased efficiency of refolding in vitro (12Luo G.X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10246-10251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mutant protein was stable, active, and purifiable from Escherichia coli. The E17P mutant does not directly address the role of the NH2-terminal segment in folding to a stable conformation during heterologous expression. We expressed NH2-terminal truncations of rhodanese in E. coli and in an E. coli-based, cell-free transcription/translation system to investigate contributions of the NH2-terminal segment to folding, stability, and resistance to degradation during heterologous expression. E. coli is considered particularly appropriate for rhodanese, since the bacterial cytosol provides a folding environment similar to the mitochondrial matrix (13Margulis L. Origin of Eukaryotic Cells. Yale University Press, New Haven1970: 178-207Google Scholar, 14Baltcheffsky H. Baltcheffsky M. Lee C.P. Schatz G. Dallner G. Mitochondria and Microsomes. Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Reading, MA1981: 519-540Google Scholar), and many useful recombinant proteins are produced in E. coli host cells. Full-length rhodanese is stable and active when expressed in E. coli (15Miller D.M. Delgado R. Chirgwin J.M. Hardies S.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4686-4691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that the first 9 residues of the NH2 terminus of rhodanese are nonessential for the activity or resistance to elimination of the protein expressed in E. coli. Deletions of 7 or 9 NH2-terminal residues alter the chemical stability of the isolated protein. Deletions of residues 10 and beyond resulted in loss of activity when the protein was expressed in E. coli at 37 °C. These same mutant proteins were not degraded in the cell-free system, and they were synthesized in similar quantities without degradation at either 30 or 37 °C. At 37 °C, the synthesized rhodanese was inactive when 10 or more NH2-terminal residues were removed. Expression at 30 °C, however, resulted in active protein even when 11 residues were deleted, showing that under conducive conditions rhodanese can fold to an active conformation even when the truncation extends into the first α-helix. In sum, the interactions involving the NH2-terminal sequence of rhodanese can have global effects on the protein altering the reactivity of the active site. DISCUSSIONIt has been speculated that the amino-terminal 23 residues of mitochondrial rhodanese contribute to the global stability of the folded protein. In one study, for example, an E17P mutant was active but less stable than wild-type rhodanese, a result that was suggested to be due to destabilization of the α-helix proximal to the amino terminus (12Luo G.X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10246-10251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another study, limited tryptic digestion could produce an active rhodanese in which the peptide composed of the NH2-terminal 45 residues was non-covalently bound. After denaturation, this form of the enzyme was not able to refold under conditions appropriate for reactivation of the native enzyme. These results were taken to indicate that portions of the NH2terminus are important for the folding of the enzyme to an active form (43Merrill G.A. Butler M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15611-15620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies used site-directed deletions to extend these earlier suggestions and to investigate effects including (a) the role of the NH2-terminal region of rhodanese in the expression of active enzyme, i.e., its resistance to elimination in vivo; (b) the effect on the enzyme kinetic parameters of active mutants; and (c) the stabilities of mutants that could be purified.Active rhodanese was expressed with deletions of up to the first nine residues. The crystal structure of wild-type rhodanese shows that these residues are situated parallel to, and form part of, the bi-domain interface, and they are the only residues out of the first 23 that interact hydrophobically with the carboxyl domain. These residues participate in a hydrophobic cluster that includes the following interactions: His-2 with Pro-266 and Asp-267; Leu-5 with Tyr-261, Leu-262, Gly-264, and Pro-266; Tyr-6 with Tyr-261; Ala-8 with Leu-258, Tyr-261, and Leu-262; and Leu-9 with Glu-222, Leu-258, and Leu-262. Hydrogen bonding of the first 9 residues is primarily with other residues of the NH2 domain. Tyr-6 is the only one of these that H-bonds to the carboxyl domain, and it makes two H bonds to Tyr-261. Thus, it could be expected that these residues may be important for acquisition or maintenance of the active enzyme. Interestingly, the present results show that these residues are non-essential for the enzymatically active conformation during heterologous expression in E. coli or for the development of the kinetic parameters that characterize the wild-type enzyme. However, the results do indicate that deletions through residue 9 may have pronounced effects on global stability of rhodanese.The crystal structure shows that residues 11–22 form an amphipathic α-helix that interacts hydrophobically solely with the NH2-terminal domain. In our experiments, truncations through Val-10 and beyond to Lys-23 resulted in mutant proteins that were rapidly degraded when expressed in E. coli. Deletion of the residues immediately preceding the start of the helix at S11 may destabilize the N-capping sequence region of the α-helix, which is oriented perpendicular to the bi-domain interface with the N-cap region closest to, and forming part of, the interface. Other interactions made by the α-helix are with residues in the region spanning from Ser-124 to His-138, which are also located predominately at the bi-domain interface region. Thus, it is likely that changes in the NH2-terminal sequence can perturb the global structure not only through effects on the NH2-terminal domain but also through effects on the bi-domain interface. That these effects cannot occur by direct interaction is suggested by the fact that Val-10 is >18 Å from the active site sulfhydryl group.All mutant proteins with deletions through Lys-23 were detected by immunoprecipitation as proteins of the predicted sizes (e.g., Fig. 2), indicating that removal of these residues did not result in cotranslational degradation in E. coli at 37 °C. Further, the protocol included solubilizing conditions so that it was clear that the mutants were degraded and not transferred into inclusion bodies. When degradation occurred, no discrete intermediates were observed. At 37 °C, deletions beyond residue 9 produced inactive enzyme both in vitro and in vivo, which was rapidly degraded in host cells. On the other hand, in the cell-free system, similar amounts of translated rhodanese, including Δ1–15, were observed in all experiments, indicating that lack of activity is a consequence of failure to fold completely and not due to degradation. Expression in the cell-free system at 30 °C showed that at least two more NH2-terminal residues, Val-10 and to a lesser extent Ser-11, could be removed and still permit synthesis of active enzyme. These two mutants were inactive when expressed at 37 °C in the cell-free system; yet, when they were expressed at 30 °C and then brought to 37 °C for 45 min, the proteins retained activity. This implies that truncation influences folding to the active conformation rather than stability of the native state. A late step in the folding pathway may require prior formation of the Ser-11–Gly-22 helix.

The present work supports several conclusions. Although residues Val-1—Leu-9 may be essential for mitochondrial import of rhodanese, they are not required for correct folding to the native state when the protein is expressed in E. coli, although they do affect the stability of the purified protein. The amino-proximal α-helix in bovine rhodanese contributes to folding, global stability, and resistance to degradation in addition to any function in import. The ability of the NH2-terminal sequence of rhodanese to perform these multiple functions may help to explain why it is not removed after mitochondrial import.

https://openalex.org/W2067134671,"To assess helical parameters that dictate fast or slow removal of carcinogen-DNA adducts, we probed human nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity with DNA containingl-deoxyriboses. Unlike natural lesions such as pyrimidine dimers or base adducts, l-deoxyribonucleosides (the mirror images of normal d-deoxyribonucleosides) involve neither the addition nor the loss of covalent bonds or functional groups and hence exclude modulation of repair efficiency by adduct chemistry and size. Previous studies showed that singlel-deoxyribonucleosides distort DNA backbones but are accommodated in the double helix with intact hydrogen bonding between complementary strands. Here, we found that such singlel-enantiomers are rejected as excision repair substrates in a NER-proficient cell extract. However, the samel-deoxyribose moiety stimulates NER activity upon incorporation into a nonhybridizing site of one or, more effectively, two base mismatches. In contrast to single l-deoxyriboses, multiple consecutive l-deoxyriboses interfere with normal hybridization; in this case, the intrinsic derangement of base pairing was sufficient to promote the excision of a cluster of three adjacentl-deoxyribonucleosides without any requirement for mismatches. Thus, using stereoselective substrates, we demonstrate the participation of a recognition subunit that guides human NER activity to sites of defective Watson-Crick strand pairing.

Mammalian nucleotide excision repair (NER)1 eliminates DNA damage with several overlapping levels of heterogeneity. Active genes are processed faster than inactive loci, and the template strand of RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes is repaired faster than the coding strand (1Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Okumoto D.S. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1985; 40: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 2Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C.

Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). However, excision efficiencies may also vary in a damage-specific manner. For example, UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are processed at lower rates than the less frequently occurring pyrimidine(6–4)pyrimidone lesions (6Mitchell D.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 7Mitchell D.L. Nairn R.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 805-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 8Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Additionally, a sequence-dependent variability occurs between closely related genomic sites. Along the p53 or phosphoglycerate kinase 1 gene of UV-irradiated human fibroblasts, repair rates of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers differ substantially with nucleotide position (9Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 10Gao S. Drouin R. Holmquist G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1438-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the nontranscribed strand of these genes, some sites are less than 5% repaired within 24 h after irradiation, whereas other neighboring positions are repaired with up to 90% efficiency during the same period. Similarly, an analysis of repair kinetics along the nontranscribed strand of the human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene shows that excision repair in response to guanine adducts of benzo[a]pyrene diol-epoxide varies by more than 1 order of magnitude (11Wei D. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2204-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The excision of 1-nitrosopyrene-induced guanine adducts in the same region of the HPRT gene is equally variable but displays a distinctly different repair pattern (12Wei D. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3714-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In some cases, sites that are slowly repaired coincide with critical mutation hotspots in human cancer cells (9Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 13Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, a consequence of excision repair heterogeneity is that mutations are generated in a biased manner, i.e. at positions of longer-persisting DNA lesions. Despite this important clinical implication, differential repair in mammalian genomes is not completely understood; in particular, the mechanistic basis of damage-specific and sequence-dependent hierarchies of excision remains obscure. Undoubtedly, DNA repair is influenced by local chromatin compaction (14Lan S.Y. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7771-7783Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Wellinger R.E. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5046-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); however, at least in the human p53 gene, no clear correlation between the pattern of DNase I or micrococcal nuclease cleavage and the repair efficiency of UV-induced lesions could be detected (16Tornaletti S. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 17: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In view of these findings, we elaborated on the hypothesis that site-specific changes in DNA conformation may contribute significantly to the observed excision repair variability (17Gunz D. Hess M.T. Naegeli H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25089-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 18Hess M.T. Gunz D. Luneva N. Geacintov N.E. Naegeli H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the mirror image of natural d-deoxyribonucleosides was introduced into DNA to generate excision repair substrates without adding new chemical bonds (such as in pyrimidine dimers) or new functional groups (such as in carcinogen-DNA adducts) and without removing normal DNA components (such as in abasic sites, urea residues, formamidopyrimidines, or other base fragmentation products). This strategy was prompted by the expectation that the repairability of a model lesion that differs from normal DNA constituents only in its inverted stereochemistry might be particularly susceptible to manipulation by altering the local double helical conformation. As a source of human NER factors, we used a standard soluble extract from HeLa cells that performs excision repair of DNA lesions in the absence of concurrent RNA polymerase II activity and is therefore thought to exhibit the same substrate selectivity as global genome repair operating on nontranscribed strands (19Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 20Sibghat-Ullah Husain I. Carlton W. Sancar A.

A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Nuclear magnetic resonance studies showed that singlel-deoxyribonucleosides are accommodated into the DNA double helix, where they establish regular hydrogen bonds with complementary partners. This intrahelical insertion coupled to correct base pairing is achieved by extensive rotation of the backbone torsion angles not only on either side of the l-deoxyribose residue in the modified strand, but also in the same region of the opposite strand (22Damha M.J. Giannaris P. Marfey P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7877-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Blommers M.J.J. Tondelli L. Garbesi A.

Soc. 1993; 115: 9852-9853Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Despite such substantially distorted DNA backbones, we found that single replacements of l-deoxyribose ford-deoxyribose are not detectably processed by the human NER system. However, exactly the same modification was a substrate of NER enzymes when combined with one or two base mismatches, implying that the site-specific loss of complementary hydrogen bonding is absolutely necessary to recruit human NER activity to l-deoxyribose residues. In support of this conclusion, we observed that three consecutive l-deoxyriboses, which disturb proper hydrogen bonding on their own, were excised even when located in a sequence of matching bases. This study, which was conducted in the complete absence of base adducts or base degradation, indicates that repair heterogeneity is determined by the involvement of a NER subunit that senses improper base pairing at sites of DNA damage. T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Creatine phosphokinase, ribonuclease A, and proteinase K were from Boehringer Mannheim. Heterochiral oligonucleotides containing single or triple l-deoxyriboses in the 19-mer sequence 5′-ACCACCCTTCGAACCACAC-3′ were synthesized using the cyanoethylphosphoramidite methodology as described previously (23Blommers M.J.J. Tondelli L. Garbesi A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7886-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After deprotection with NH4OH, each product was purified by dissolving the crude compound in 1 ml of H2O followed by extraction with 10 ml of butanol. A site-directed acetylaminofluorene-C8-guanine (AAF-C8-dG) adduct was produced by incubating the 19-mer oligonucleotide 5′-ACCACCCTTCGAACCACAC-3′ or its analogs containing a singlel-deoxyribose withN-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (purchased from the National Cancer Institute Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository) as described previously (25Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M. Giese B. Naegeli H. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a site-specific AAF-C8-dG was generated at the single guanine in the 11-mer sequence 5′-CCATCGCTACC-3′ (18Hess M.T. Gunz D. Luneva N. Geacintov N.E. Naegeli H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The resulting AAF-modified oligonucleotides migrated on a 20% polyacrylamide gel markedly slower than the undamaged controls. The melting temperature of unmodified or modified 19-mer duplexes (2.7 mm) was determined in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 0.1 mNaCl using a Perkin-Elmer 554 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a MGW Lauda RC5 temperature controller and a MGW Lauda R40/2 digital thermometer. Shortly before each melting experiment, the sample cuvettes were heated to 80 °C and then slowly cooled (for 2 h) to 6 °C to allow for reannealing. An electronic device generated a temperature gradient of 0.5 °C/min from 10 °C to 80 °C, and UV absorbance was recorded at 260 nm. Moisture condensation at low temperatures was prevented by flushing the cell holder with nitrogen. Under these conditions, unmodified 19-mer duplexes yielded a melting temperature of 70.2 °C. Internally radiolabeled DNA duplexes of 147 base pairs were obtained by ligating unmodified or modified 19-mer oligonucleotide (5′-ACCACCCTTCGAACCACAC-3′) with five other partially overlapping oligonucleotides (Fig. 2 A) as described previously (25Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M. Giese B. Naegeli H. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Huang J.-C. Hsu D.S. Kazantsev A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12213-12217Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The sequence of the complementary 27-mer oligonucleotide was 5′-GCTCGTGTGGTTCGAAGGGTGGTTCAG-3′. Alternatively, this 27-mer sequence was replaced by 5′-GCTCGTGTGGTTTGAAGGGTGGTTCAG-3′ or 5′-GCTCGTGTGGTTTTAAGGGTGGTTCAG-3′ to obtain substrates containing one or two mismatches. The four flanking oligonucleotides of 59–64 residues had exactly the same sequence as that described in Matsunagaet al. (27Matsunaga T. Mu D. Park C.-H. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20862-20869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For the construction of linear double-stranded substrates, the central 19-mer oligonucleotide (70 pmol) was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (7,000 Ci/mmol; ICN Pharmaceuticals) and mixed with 100 pmol of each of the other five oligonucleotides that were phosphorylated with cold ATP. The mixture was annealed and ligated in the presence of T4 DNA ligase, followed by electrophoretic purification of the full-length fragments of 147 base pairs as described previously (21Huang J.-C.

U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12213-12217Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the experiment described in Fig. 5, we also employed a duplex substrate of 139 base pairs that was constructed using exactly the same method but starting with the acetylaminofluorene-modified 11-mer 5′-CCATCGCTACC-3′ and the complementary 19-mer sequence 5′-GCTCGGTAGCGATGGTCAG-3′ (18Hess M.T. Gunz D. Luneva N. Geacintov N.E. Naegeli H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Full-length substrates were stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Circular M13 DNA molecules containing site-directed modifications between the SmaI and PstI restriction sites were obtained by ligating unmodified or modified 19-mer oligonucleotides into a gapped M13 intermediate (25Hess M.T.

Double-stranded covalently closed M13 substrates were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C.Figure 5Excision of triplel-deoxyriboses. Internally radiolabeled linear substrates (5 fmol; 75,000 dpm/reaction) carrying three consecutivel-deoxyribonucleosides (shown in bold letters) were incubated in HeLa cell extract at 30 °C. Lane 5 shows the excision of an AAF-C8-dG adduct located in a slightly different sequence context. Lanes 1, 2, 6, and 7contain undamaged control substrate. The incubations of lanes 1–8 were stopped after 40 min. Lanes 9–11 show a time course of oligonucleotide excision.

After the indicated incubation times at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS to 0.3% (w/v) and proteinase K to 200 μg/ml, followed by proteinase K digestion for 15 min at 37 °C. DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and resolved by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide denaturing gels, after which oligonucleotide excision products were visualized by autoradiography. The relative levels of excision were quantified by densitometric analysis of oligonucleotides in the 24–32-mer size range on appropriately exposed x-ray films. The linearity of this densitometric quantification was confirmed by counting Cerenkov radiations of representative gel slices. Repair synthesis was measured on site-specifically modified M13 DNA by a method that was modified from that of Hansson et al. (30Hansson J. Munn M. Rupp W.D. Kahn R. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21788-21792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions of 50 μl contained HeLa cell extract (80 μg of proteins); 100 ng of double-stranded M13 DNA substrate; 45 mm HEPES, pH 7.8; 70 mm KCl; 7.4 mm MgCl2; 0.9 mm dithiothreitol; 0.4 mm EDTA; 3.4% (v/v) glycerol; 2 mm ATP; 20 μm each of dATP, dGTP, and TTP; 8 μm dCTP; 2.0 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol); 40 mmphosphocreatine; 2.5 μg of creatine phosphokinase; and 18 μg of bovine serum albumin. After 3 h at 30 °C, repair reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 20 mm. The samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with ribonuclease A (80 μg/ml). SDS to 0.5% (w/v) and proteinase K to 190 μg/ml were added, and the mixtures were incubated for another 45 min at 37 °C. M13 DNA was extracted; digested with AvaII, SmaI, and PstI; and analyzed by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The treatment with restriction enzymes produces SmaI-PstI fragments of 37 base pairs that contain the radiolabeled repair patches. NER activity was determined using the oligonucleotide excision assay devised by Huang et al. (21Huang J.-C. Svoboda D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar,26Huang J.-C. Hsu D.S. Kazantsev A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12213-12217Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This cell-free assay provides high levels of sensitivity and specificity because it exploits the unique dual DNA incision pattern of human NER. Appropriate DNA substrates of 147 base pairs with a site-directed modification in the sequence 5′-TCGA-3′ were constructed from six different oligomers as illustrated in Fig. 2 A. Before ligation, the central 19-mer oligonucleotide was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP at its 5′ end such that the resulting 147-mer duplex contained an internal radiolabel in the vicinity of the modified residue (Fig. 2 B). After purification, the double-stranded fragments were incubated for 40 min at 30 °C in reaction mixtures that contained a standard NER-proficient HeLa cell extract (19Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 20Sibghat-Ullah Husain I. Carlton W. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4471-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), ATP, and all four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Dual DNA incision by human NER generates radioactive oligonucleotides (Fig. 2 B) that were separated from substrate DNA by denaturing gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography.In vitro repair reactions performed with linear 147-mer substrate containing a single AAF-C8-dG adduct in the sequence 5′-TCGA-3′ yielded characteristic excision products that migrated on polyacrylamide gels as an oligomeric ladder with lengths ranging from 24 to 30 nucleotides (Fig. 3 A, lane 6; Fig. 3 B, lane 1). No excision products were released from undamaged control DNA (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 7), although intact 147-mer substrate as well as the radioactive bands generated by nonspecific nuclease activity can be observed at similar levels at the top of the gel. We then introduced a single l-deoxyribose at the thymine, guanine, or adenine position of the sequence 5′-TCGA-3′, but none of the tested deoxyribose replacements were able to elicit detectable NER activity in HeLa cell extract. In fact, incubation of linear substrate containing a single l-dG paired with dC yielded no oligomeric excision products (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). Similarly,l-dA paired with dT (Fig. 3 B, lane 2) orl-dT paired with dA (Fig. 3 B, lane 3) failed to stimulate oligonucleotide excision. To rule out the possibility that the presence of a single l-deoxyribonucleoside may not be compatible with productive binding of NER proteins to DNA, we also tested substrate molecules containing both l-deoxyribose and a unique AAF-C8-dG adduct in close proximity. For that purpose, 19-mer oligonucleotides comprising either a singlel-dA or a single l-dT residue in the 5′-TCGA-3′ sequence were exposed to N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene to generate an AAF-C8-dG lesion near thel-deoxyribose site (see “Materials and Methods”). After purification, the resulting oligonucleotides were incorporated into internally radiolabeled double-stranded fragments and incubated in HeLa cell extract for 40 min. As shown in Fig. 3 B, these double modifications resulted in about 2-fold higher levels of oligonucleotide excision relative to the substrate containing the AAF-C8-dG adduct alone (compare lane 1 with lanes 4 and 5). The changing size pattern of excision products may indicate that in some cases either the AAF adduct or thel-deoxyribose residue is repaired, leading to mixed reaction products. Thus, l-deoxyribose substitutions exert stimulatory rather than inhibitory effects on the excision of adjacent AAF-C8-dG lesions. On the other hand, the complete lack of human NER activity in response to single l-deoxyriboses (in the absence of concurrent AAF modifications) was confirmed by measurements of DNA repair synthesis in HeLa cell extract (Fig. 4). To that end, 19-mer oligonucleotides containing AAF-C8-dG,l-dA, or l-dT within the same sequence context 5′-TCGA-3′ were incorporated into gapped M13 DNA. The lesion site in the resulting circular duplex was flanked by restriction sites forSmaI and PstI, as illustrated in Fig. 4 A. Control DNA was obtained by ligating unmodified 19-mers into the SmaI-PstI region of the M13 substrate. Covalently closed M13 DNA was then incubated with HeLa cell extract in the presence of ATP, an ATP regenerating system, and all four deoxyribonucleosides triphosphates including [32P]dCTP. After 3-h reactions at 30 °C, M13 molecules were recovered, and DNA repair synthesis was monitored by visualizing the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the 37-base pairSmaI-PstI region of modified or unmodified M13 substrates (Fig. 4 B). Consistent with the absence of oligonucleotide excision (Fig. 3 B), we found that neitherl-dA (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3) norl-dT (lanes 6 and 7) stimulated DNA repair synthesis over the background value detected in theSmaI-PstI site of undamaged control substrate (lane 1). However, M13 DNA containing an AAF-C8-dG adduct near l-dA (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and 5) or near l-dT (lanes 8 and 9) was subject to higher levels of NER activity than the corresponding substrate containing the AAF adduct alone (lane 10). These results support the notion that a singlel-deoxyribose component does not interfere with proper interactions between human NER factors and damaged DNA. Previous studies demonstrating that singlel-deoxyribonucleosides preserve normal Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding within complementary sequences (22Damha M.J. Giannaris P. Marfey P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7877-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Blommers M.J.J. Tondelli L. Garbesi A.

Soc. 1993; 115: 9852-9853Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) prompted us to test the same l-residues in combination with mismatched bases. We found that HeLa cell extract catalyzed oligomeric excision when a single l-deoxyribose was incorporated into an altered sequence containing two base mismatches (Fig. 3 A, lane 5). A direct comparison with appropriate markers indicated that the excised oligonucleotides range from 24 to about 30 residues in length and hence constitute characteristic products of human NER activity. Considerably lower but nevertheless detectable amounts of excised oligomers were also found when the linear substrate with a single l-deoxyribose was combined with only one mismatch (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). Importantly, no measurable oligonucleotide excision occurred in control reactions performed with substrate containing two mismatches (Fig. 3 A, lane 2) or one mismatch (data not shown), but in the absence ofl-deoxyribose replacements. In each case, we used laser scanning densitometry of appropriately exposed x-ray films to determine the relative level of specific 24–32-nucleotide-long excision products. The quantification of three to four independent experiments shows that human NER activity in response to a singlel-deoxyribose was stimulated weakly by the concomitant presence of one mismatch, but the reaction was stimulated strongly upon combination with two mismatches. In contrast, essentially no NER activity was detected in response to one or two mismatches alone (Fig. 3 C). Because we introducedl-deoxyribonucleosides as artificial model substrates for studying NER enzymes, the question of whether they could also serve as substrates for mismatch repair or base excision repair systems has not been investigated. Our results indicate that l-deoxyribose substitutions are processed by human NER only when their presence in DNA is accompanied by the disruption of normal base pairing interactions. To confirm this conclusion, we tested the repairability of a triple l-deoxyribose modification. In contrast to single l-residues, multiple consecutivel-deoxyribonucleosides have been shown to reject hybridization with complementary d-oligonucleotides (31Garbesi A. Capobianco M.L. Colonna F.P. Tondelli L. Arcamone F. Manzini G. Hilbers C.W. Aelen J.M.E. Blommers M.J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4159-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here, we estimated the double helical stability of DNA molecules containing a site of three consecutive l-deoxyriboses by assessing the melting temperature of complementary 19-mer duplexes carrying this modification (see “Materials and Methods”). We found that the introduction of a triple l-deoxyribose substitution decreases the melting temperature to a similar extent (∼15 °C) as three consecutive mismatches in a central position of the same 19-mer duplex (32Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M. Giese B. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6664-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, a sequence of threel-deoxyriboses is not compatible with normal hydrogen bonding between complementary base pairs, raising the expectation that such a cluster of three consecutive l-deoxyriboses may constitute a NER substrate. We therefore incubated complementary DNA duplexes containing the three l-deoxyribose residues in HeLa cell extract and found that the triple l-deoxyribose site was removed with the formation of specific oligomeric excision products ranging in length from about 22 to 30 nucleotides (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). The major oligonucleotides resulting from this repair activity are comparable in size to the excision products elicited by an AAF-C8-dG adduct in the same sequence 5′-TCGA-3′ (compare with Fig. 3 A, lane 6). We also noted that the triplel-deoxyribose lesion generates excision products that have a broader distribution but are nevertheless centered around the same size range as the corresponding products resulting from an AAF-C8-dG adduct in the different sequence 5′-TCGC-3′ (Fig.5, lanes 5 and 8). Finally, time course experiments indicate that the smaller excision products (<24 residues in length) generated in response to the triplel-deoxyribose site result from progressive oligonucleotide degradation during incubations of 20 min or longer (Fig. 5, lanes 9–11). Human NER is a multisubunit DNA damage-processing system that cleaves damaged strands on either side of the targeted lesion and generates oligonucleotide excision products of 24–32 residues in length (33Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 34Sancar A. Annu. Rev.

Landes, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). This dual DNA incision and excision reaction is followed by DNA repair synthesis (to reconstitute the correct nucleotide sequence) and DNA ligation (to reestablish double helical integrity). The present study is concerned with the question of how the conformational properties of damaged DNA molecules may cause extremely heterogeneous excision activities in response to carcinogen-DNA adducts. Recent comparisons of substrate selectivity led us to suggest the existence of a conformational sensor that attracts the human NER system to lesion sites that interfere with Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding. In fact, we observed that critical NER factors are recruited up to 3 orders of magnitude more efficiently to helix destabilizing adducts than to helix stabilizing adducts (17Gunz D. Hess M.T. Naegeli H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25089-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The involvement of a protein sensor that detects improper base pairing is consistent with another study in which we established that fast excision of (+)- or (−)-cis-benzo[a]pyrene diol-epoxide-N 2-dG lesions is associated with complete disruption of local Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding interactions, whereas slow excision of (+)- or (−)-trans-benzo[a]pyrene diol-epoxide-N 2-dG adducts correlates with the presence of partially normal hydrogen bonds between the modified guanine and its cytosine partner (18Hess M.T. Gunz D. Luneva N. Geacintov N.E. Naegeli H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). One may argue, however, that the substrate selectivity observed in these previous studies may result from the different chemical structure of the tested adducts or, alternatively, from the distinct geometry of carcinogen-DNA bonding, rather than from their diverging effects on local base pairing interactions. To further dissect this problem, we have introduced the mirror image of natural d-deoxyribose constituents of DNA and obtained artificial model lesions that involve neither the addition nor the loss of covalent bonds or functional groups (Fig. 1). Earlier studies on l-deoxyribonucleosides have focused on the observation that l-dT and several l-nucleoside analogs are phosphorylated by the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase and inhibit viral proliferation in infected cells (38Spadari S. Ciarrocchi G. Focher F. Verri A. Maga G. Arcamone F. Iafrate E. Manzini S. Garbesi A. Tondelli L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1231-1238PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have incorporated l-deoxyribonucleoside derivatives into DNA to analyze the mechanism of substrate discrimination by excision repair enzymes, thereby confirming that human NER activity is strictly dependent on the loss of hydrogen bonds at lesion sites. Although there is considerable distortion of both backbones in the double helix, single l-deoxyribonucleosides maintain intact Watson-Crick pairing with complementary residues, and we observed that this stereochemical variant was processed in HeLa cell extract only upon combination with at least one base mismatch. In contrast to a single l-deoxyribose, multiple consecutivel-nucleosides are not compatible with proper Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding (31Garbesi A. Capobianco M.L. Colonna F.P. Tondelli L. Arcamone F. Manzini G. Hilbers C.W. Aelen J.M.E. Blommers M.J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4159-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); in fact, we observed that a triplel-deoxyribose modification reduces the melting temperature of duplex DNA to a similar extent as three consecutive base mismatches within the same sequence. Molecular modeling using the Hyperchem program predicts that this local instability results from abnormal pairing geometries between the three l-nucleosides and their complementary d-residues such that the three atoms participating in each hydrogen bond (the donor, the hydrogen atom, and the acceptor) lose their straight alignment. 2M. Capobianco, unpublished results. As expected from the experiments with single l-deoxyriboses, a cluster of three l-deoxyribose residues was excised even in the absence of concomitant changes in base complementarity. Thus, the inherent instability of Watson-Crick interactions at the triplel-deoxyribose site obviates the need for mismatched sequences. Enhanced excision at sites of reduced hydrogen bonding capability was also found in recent studies in which cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or cisplatin intrastrand cross-links were combined with base mismatches (39Mu D. Tursun M. Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 40Moggs J.G. Szymkowski D.E. Yamada M. Karran P. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Conversely, we observed that conformational distortions induced solely by one, two, or three adjacent mismatches were unable to elicit detectable oligonucleotide excision on their own (this study and Refs. 18Hess M.T. Gunz D. Luneva N. Geacintov N.E. Naegeli H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar and 32Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M. Giese B. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6664-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The lack of NER activity in response to mismatched bases is consistent with the recently proposed bipartite mechanism of damage recognition in which disruptions of base pairing are absolutely necessary but are not sufficient by themselves to promote NER activity. In addition to base pair disruption, DNA incision requires changes in the normal deoxyribonucleotide structure (32Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M. Giese B. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6664-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In summary, our analysis of substrate discrimination between normald-deoxyribose and abnormal l-deoxyribose variants demonstrates that human NER activity is exquisitely sensitive to local base pairing interactions. In particular, efficient excision depends on reduced Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding at the lesion site and, as a consequence, varies with different adducts and different nucleotide sequences (8Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 9Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P.

This study provides additional evidence for the existence of a conformational sensor that monitors the thermodynamic stability of complementary hydrogen bonds and recruits the human NER system to sites of improper base pairing. Current research is aimed at the identification of this unique conformational sensor through systematic characterization of xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein, replication protein A, and other human NER factors.

In addition to identifying residues important for lactose transport function, the analysis revealed that numerous mutations made lac permease highly toxic to cells. In the most extreme cases, production of such proteins at very low steady-state levels reduced cell viability greater than 104-fold. Both frameshift and missense mutations led to toxicity, with the frameshift mutations having the strongest effects observed. The toxic missense mutations corresponded to changes in TM12 expected to interfere with membrane insertion or folding, such as the introduction of charged residues or prolines in the putative helix. The results suggest that cellular toxicity may be a relatively common consequence of mutations altering integral membrane protein folding. An analogous toxicity might contribute to the pathogenesis of several degenerative diseases caused by mutant membrane proteins, such as retinitis pigmentosa, Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease.

Several diseases caused by mutant integral membrane proteins show dominant inheritance and are associated with tissue degeneration. These diseases include autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (1Humphries P. Kenna P. Farrarr G.J. Science. 1992; 256: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Al-Maghteth M. Gregory C. Inglehearn C. Hardcastle A. Bhattacharya S. Hum.

A simple hypothesis to help account for the pathogenesis of such diseases is that they reflect a general phenomenon in which mutations render membrane proteins directly toxic to cells (4Manoil C. Traxler B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 131-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This report describes a mutational analysis of the 12th transmembrane segment (TM12)1 of Escherichia coli lac permease (5Kaback H.R. Konings W. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J. Handbook of Biological Physics: Transport Processes in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Organisms. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 203-207Google Scholar, 6Varela M. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our studies identify a set of TM12 residues that tolerate a variety of substitutions without loss of transport activity. These residues show an α-helical periodicity and may correspond to a side of the TM12 helix which faces the lipid bilayer. A number of missense and frameshift mutations were also identified which render lac permease toxic to cells. The toxic missense changes did not cluster on either the tolerant or sensitive face of TM12 and corresponded to changes expected to cause misfolding of the mutant proteins. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Plasmid pCS112 is a pBR322- based plasmid derived from pCM472 (7Calamia J. Manoil C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) which carries a modified lacY with a UGA nonsense codon corresponding to codon 386 and a StyI restriction site at the NH2-terminal end of the sequence encoding TM12 (Table I). To construct pCS112, a SspI-SspI fragment that included phoA was first deleted from pCM472. Second, theStyI site in the tet gene was removed byStyI cleavage, followed by DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment and T4 DNA ligase treatments. Third, a StyI cleavage site was introduced at a position corresponding to the NH2-terminal end of TM12, and a UGA termination codon (codon 386) and SpeI cleavage site were introduced within the sequence corresponding to TM12 by site-directed mutagenesis. The new StyI and SspI restriction sites are unique in pCS112, and the lacY it carries is inactive because of the termination codon. Plasmid pCS111 is identical to pCS112 except that it encodes active lac permease, with a glycine codon at position 386.Table IBacteriaStrainGenotypeCC815ΔlacY4700∷catΔ(ara, leu)7697 phoA20 galE galK thi rpsE rpoBargE(am) pcnB cysC3152∷Tn10dkanCC819F′lacI + Δ(lacZ-lacY)4784∷cat/ Δ(lac)X74 Δ(ara, leu)7697 phoA20galEgalK thi rpsE rpoB argE(am)pcnB zad∷Tn10CC1006F128lacI + lacZ +ΔlacY4700∷cat / Δ(lac)U169araD139 rpsL thi pcnBpcnBzad∷Tn10CC1351F128lacI q lacZ +ΔlacY4700∷cat / Δ(lac)U169araD139 rpsL thiPlasmidDescriptionpCM701pBR322-derived plasmid encoding LacY with a 31-codon insert corresponding to residue 38 (11)pCS311pBR322-derived plasmid encoding wild-type LacYpCS112pBR322-derived plasmid encoding LacY with a nonsense codon (UGA) corresponding to amino acid 386 Open table in a new tab Cells were cultured on TYE agar (per liter: 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 8 g of NaCl, and 15 g of Bacto-agar (Difco)), MacConkey lactose agar (Difco), or M63 minimal medium (8Miller J. Experiments in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) containing 0.2% glucose, glycerol, or lactose. A degenerate mixture of 80-nucleotide oligomers corresponding to LacY TM12 was synthesized (5′-ggt ttc caa ggc GCt TAT CTg GTg CTg GGt CTg GTg GCg CTg GGc TTC ACc TTA ATT TCc GTg TTC ACg ctt agc ggc cc-3′, with 2.5% contamination of an equimolar mixture of all 4 bases at the positions shown in capital letters). This oligomer spans two restriction sites in pCS112: the engineeredStyI site (CCAAGG), corresponding to the NH2-terminal end of TM12, and a naturally occurringBlpI site (GCTTAGC), corresponding to the COOH-terminal end of TM12. A double-stranded DNA cassette corresponding to the 80-mer mixture was synthesized essentially as described by Lim and Sauer (9Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The resulting DNA was purified by elution from an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and digested with StyI (15 units) and Bpu1102 (7.5 units) or BlpI (30 units). This fragment was mixed with pCS112 that had also been digested withStyI and BlpI and treated with T4 DNA ligase. The mixture was then digested with SpeI to render uncut parental pCS112 linear (and therefore poorly transformable), and the DNA was then precipitated and transformed by electroporation into CC815. Transformants were selected by growth on TYE agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.2% glucose. (The glucose is included to minimize expression of lacY.) Colonies were replica printed onto MacConkey lactose agar containing ampicillin to assess LacY activity and the efficiency of mutagenesis (cells receiving parental plasmids formed white colonies, whereas cells receiving active mutant plasmids formed red colonies) and onto TYE agar containing ampicillin and 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) to detect toxic phenotypes associated with induction of LacY synthesis. Sequence changes in TM12 were identified by the dideoxynucleotide termination DNA sequencing of plasmid DNA using a primer (5′-TAA GCA ACT GGC GAT GA-3′) hybridizing at the 5′-side of the sequence encoding TM12. Radioactive lactose uptake assays were carried out using the Δ(lacZ-lacY) strain CC819 carrying mutant plasmids. The lacZ mutation prevents metabolism of transported lactose. CC819 maintains the lacY plasmids at reduced copy number because of a pcnB mutation, leading to a level of lac permease production such that uptake of [14C]lactose under assay conditions is linear with respect to the amount of protein/cell (10Lee M.H. Manoil C. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). 2J. Bailey and C. Stewart, unpublished results. Uptake of [14C]lactose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was assayed as described (10Lee M.H. Manoil C. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown overnight at room temperature, diluted toA 600 ∼0.1 and grown at 37 °C toA 600 ∼0.9. IPTG was then added (2 mm final), and the cells were harvested after a 45-min incubation at 37 °C. Cells were then rinsed twice in buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mmMgSO4), resuspended at A 600 ∼5.8, and [14C]lactose uptake into 50-μl cell aliquots measured as a function of time at room temperature. Cells were harvested from cultures grown as described above for [14C]lactose uptake assays. Whole-cell protein was prepared by centrifuging 1.5 ml of culture (5 min at 5,000 × g) followed by resuspension of the cell pellet in 0.25 ml of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS) and heating to 55 °C for 10 min. Protein samples were diluted 1/20 in distilled water and quantified by Lowry assay (Sigma). Immediately before loading samples for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, β-mercaptoethanol was added to 5%, and the samples were again heated at 55 °C for 10 min. Equal amounts of total protein from each sample (usually 50 μg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9–12% gel with 3.5% stacking gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose or Westran polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were incubated in 5% Carnation dry milk in TBST (100 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h and then exposed to an antibody recognizing the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic sequence of lac permease. This antibody can detect protein levels that are approximately 2% that of wild-type. 3C. Stewart, unpublished results. Frameshift mutations were subcloned into pCM701, which encodes LacY with a 31-codon insert at a position corresponding to amino acid 38 (11Manoil C. Bailey J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To do this, the 1.4-kilobase BstXI-PstI fragment of the pCS112-derived mutants was joined to the 3.7-kilobaseBstXI-PstI fragment of pCM701 (not shown). The production of LacY frameshift products was then analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody recognizing the 31-residue inserted sequence (11Manoil C. Bailey J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The anti-insert antibody can detect protein levels that are approximately 4% that of wild-type.3 A secondary antibody (anti-rabbit) complexed to alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) was used with both primary antibodies. In some cases, Western blotting was carried out as above except that blots were incubated in TNT (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100), the secondary antibody was linked to horseradish peroxidase, and the blot was developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two assays of toxicity to cells were used: one based on the relative efficiency of colony formation under conditions of lac permease expression, and the other based on the segregation of lacY − cells during growth on indicator agar-inducing lac expression. The assay of colony-forming efficiency under inducing conditions was carried out by plating dilutions of cells (grown to stationary phase in LB containing ampicillin) after centrifugation and resuspension in buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2) on M63-glycerol supplemented with IPTG (1 mm) and cAMP (2.5 mm) (for plasmids in CC1006) or IPTG alone (1 mm) (for plasmids in CC1351) and unsupplemented M63-glycerol. Colonies were counted after a 2-day incubation at 42 °C. The second assay depended on the fact that cells expressing toxic plasmid-borne mutant lacY genes segregate faster growing plasmid-free cells. Such cells are LacY− and can be distinguished from LacY+ cells on media containing X-gal. For the tests, cells were streaked on TYE containing IPTG and X-gal and scored after a 2-day incubation at 37 °C for the presence of light blue sectors and papillae that had arisen from dark blue primary colonies. The sequence corresponding to the TM12 of lac permease (Fig. 1 A) was mutagenized using an efficient “cassette” method (Fig. 1 B) (9Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thelac permease gene (lacY) gene was present in a small plasmid (pCS112) and carried a mutation creating a termination codon (UGA) corresponding to a site within TM12 (codon 386). The nonsense codon inactivates the lac permease, and pCS112 transformants of a lacZ + lacY − strain therefore produce white (LacY−) colonies on MacConkey lactose indicator agar. To generate mutations, double-stranded oligonucleotide fragments corresponding to TM12 and derived from a degenerate mixture were inserted into pCS112 plasmids, replacing the pCS112 sequence. The mixture was transformed into CC815, a lacZ+Δ(lacY) strain that maintains pCS112 at reduced copy number because of a pcnB − mutation (12Lopilato J. Bortner S. Beckwith J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). CC815 produces about three times as much lac permease as a strain containing a single chromosomal copy of lacY(10Lee M.H. Manoil C. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).3 Transformant cells that formed LacY+(red) colonies on indicator agar (MacConkey lactose) had acquired plasmids in which the inactive pCS112 TM12 sequence had been replaced by functional sequences. Transformant cells that formed LacY− (white) colonies on the indicator agar carried either mutagenized plasmids encoding nonfunctional TM12 sequences or pCS112 parent plasmid that escaped mutagenesis. The parent plasmid DNA could be distinguished from mutant by the presence of a restriction site (SpeI), and cleavage by SpeI before transformation reduced the amount of parent plasmid in the mixture (Fig. 1 B). Using these procedures, 35 different LacY+ and 28 different LacY− mutant plasmids were identified for analysis (Tables IIand III).Table IIActive lac permease substitution mutantsTM12[14C]Lactose uptake2-a[14C]Lactose uptake was determined for mutant plasmids in strain CC819 as described under “Materials and Methods.” An isogenic Δ(lacY) mutant showed 1% the lactose transport activity of the lacY + strain. +++, estimated to correspond to >54% wild-type activity based on the behavior of mutants on MacConkey lactose and M63 lactose media.

Transformants resulting from the cassette mutagenesis of pCS112 were also screened for toxicity associated with mutant lacpermease synthesis (see “Materials and Methods”). Transformant colonies (on MacConkey lactose or TYE agar) were replica printed onto TYE agar supplemented with IPTG and X-gal to induce high levellac expression. This medium allows the detection of LacY− cells that arise during further growth because such cells do not hydrolyze X-gal as efficiently as do LacY+cells and therefore form light blue sectors and papillae. Toxicity was detected as decreased growth accompanied by abundant papillation of LacY− cells. 18 mutants exhibiting growth inhibition associated with lac induction were identified (Table IV).Table IVToxic lac permease mutationsTM12Protein recovery4-aAs determined by Western blot analysis using antibody directed against the COOH-terminal region of lac permease (see “Materials and Methods”).[14C]Lactose uptake4-b[14C]Lactose uptake was determined for mutant plasmids in strain CC819 as described under “Materials and Methods.” An isogenic Δ(lacY) mutant showed 1% the lactose transport activity of the lacY + strain.Survival4-cDetermined as the ratio of colony-forming units on minimal glycerol agar containing cAMP +IPTG/−IPTG (see “Materials and Methods”).

Dots correspond to positions with wild-type residues. Open table in a new tab The sequence changes in different mutants are indicated. The wild-type TM12 sequence is shown, with residues that appear relatively intolerant of substitution shown in boldface type. Plasmid DNAs were sequenced to identify TM12 changes, and representatives of all mutant classes were assayed to determine rates of [14C]lactose uptake (Tables Table II, Table III, Table IV). The TM12 sequences of the mutants exhibiting significant lac permease activity are listed in Table II. 25 of these mutants carry single amino acid substitutions, and 10 carry changes at two sites. Most of the changes are relatively conservative. These mutants formed red colonies on MacConkey lactose agar, grew significantly better than a Δ(lacY) strain on minimal lactose agar, and (when assayed) exhibited at least 54% of the wild-type rate of [14C]lactose transport. These mutants thus carry sequence changes that are tolerated without major effects on the membrane insertion, folding, or transport activities of the proteins. From the collection of active substitutions identified, it appears that some sites in TM12 tolerate a greater variety of substitutions than do others (Table II). When TM12 is diagrammed as a helical wheel, the residues tolerating the greatest variety of substitutions cluster on one face (centered on Ile-395) (Fig. 2). Opposite this face is a cluster of 10 residues (centered on Thr-393) for which either no active substitutions or only relatively conservative active substitutions were identified. (The only exception was Y382C.) The angle of the net variation moment for the helical wheel sequences corresponds approximately to the angle of the net hydrophobic moment (Fig. 2) (13Rees D.C. DeAntonio L. Eisenberg D. Science. 1989; 245: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). By analogy to studies of theRhodobacter photosynthetic reaction center (see “Discussion”), we suspect that the substitution-tolerant, hydrophobic side of TM12 faces membrane phospholipids in foldedlac permease. The TM12 sequences of substitution mutants exhibiting reduced lacpermease activity are shown in Table III. Although the majority of mutants that lacked all detectable lactose transport activity carried frameshift or deletion mutations, such mutants were not studied in detail. 4M. Jurica and C. Stewart, unpublished data. The substitution mutants ranged from those that appeared to be completely inactive (i.e. indistinguishable from a ΔlacY strain in lactose utilization on different media and in lactose uptake activity) to those exhibiting considerable activity (e.g. up to 19% of the rate of [14C]lactose uptake of wild-type control cells). Nearly all of the missense mutants that expressed greatly reduced activity had suffered changes that either altered intolerant residues or introduced charged residues (Table III). The TM12 sequences of the mutants that were toxic to cells are shown in Table IV. To quantify the growth defects of different mutants, the efficiencies of colony formation underlac-inducing conditions were measured. The tests were carried out using strains maintaining plasmids at normal (PcnB+) or reduced (PcnB−) copy number. (ThepcnB mutation reduces the pBR322-based plasmid copy number approximately 10-fold (12Lopilato J. Bortner S. Beckwith J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).) Both LacY+ and LacY− toxic mutations were identified (Table IV). Again, most of the completely inactive mutants carried frameshift mutations. The recovery of frameshift mutants was a surprise because the cassette mutagenesis was designed to yield missense mutants (Fig. 1 B). We assume that the frameshift mutations were generated by contaminating oligonucleotides present in the mixture used for cassette mutagenesis. Three classes of toxic mutants could be distinguished based on the degree of toxicity (Table IV). The most toxic class (all of the frameshift mutants except FS12) reduced the efficiency of colony formation dramatically (101 to >104-fold) under inducing conditions when expressed at low copy number in PcnB− strains. The second class of mutants (G386A V388E, L390P F392Y, MQD, YREMVQ, FS12) showed greatly reduced efficiency of plating (101 to 105-fold) when the corresponding plasmids were carried in PcnB+ strains but not in PcnB− strains. The third and weakest class of mutants (L383R, L385P, G391V I395S, L394P T399F, LEF, PEP) formed small colonies and/or showed increased papillation and sectoring of faster growing cells on X-gal indicator agar containing IPTG in PcnB+ strains but did not show greatly decreased efficiencies of colony formation. The steady-state cellular levels of missense mutant proteins were measured by Western blotting using an antibody recognizing a COOH-terminal epitope of lac permease (Fig. 3 A; Tables III and IV) (see “Materials and Methods”). The amounts of protein detected from toxic missense mutants varied from being comparable to wild-type to undetectable (i.e. less than approximately 2% of wild-type) (Fig. 3 A and Table IV). The results imply that the COOH-terminal epitope is susceptible to cellular degradation in some of the mutants; it is possible that the rest of the protein is degraded in such mutants as well. Because the antisera used to detect missense proteins could not recognize frameshift mutant proteins due to the altered COOH-terminal sequence, toxic frameshift mutations were subcloned into a plasmid (pCM701) that encodes an epitope-taggedlac permease (11Manoil C. Bailey J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The tag is a 31-amino acid insertion in the most NH2-terminal periplasmic segment of the protein, and the insert does not significantly reduce lactose transport or the steady-state cellular level of the protein (11Manoil C. Bailey J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Using antisera recognizing the epitope, we observed that all of the toxic frameshift products were either undetectable or were detected at a greatly reduced level relative to the parent (Fig. 3 B and Table IV). Nontoxic frameshift mutant proteins were also undetectable in analogous tests (not shown). Earlier studies of COOH-terminal truncation mutants using a method that did not involve antibody binding showed that loss of TM12 residues resulted in cellular proteolysis of the mutant proteins (14McKenna E. Hardy D. Pastore J.C. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2969-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15McKenna E. Hardy D. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6471-6474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This report describes an extensive mutational analysis of the most COOH-terminal transmembrane sequence (TM12) of E. coli lacpermease. There were two principal findings of the study. First, about half of the sites in TM12 tolerated a variety of residues without loss of transport activity. These tolerant sites were arranged with a helical periodicity and may make up part of the lipid-facing surface of the protein. Second, a number of mutations made the alteredlac permeases highly toxic to cells. The frameshift and missense changes leading to toxicity are expected to cause protein folding defects, a result suggesting that integral membrane protein misfolding may, in many cases, inhibit growth. A number of TM12 substitutions had small effects on lacpermease transport activity. When TM12 is represented as an α-helix, the sites most tolerant of substitutions cluster on one face, which is also the most hydrophobic face of the helix (Fig. 2). Studies of sequence polymorphisms of the Rhodobacter photosynthetic reaction center have shown that residues facing the lipid bilayer are less conserved and more hydrophobic than residues internal to the folded protein (13Rees D.C. DeAntonio L. Eisenberg D. Science. 1989; 245: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). By analogy, we assume that the substitution-tolerant, hydrophobic side of TM12 faces the surface in folded lac permease. Studies of lac permease TM8 (16Hinkle P.C. Hinkle P.V. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10989-10994Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and TM10 (17Goswitz V.C. Matzke E.A. Taylor M.R. Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21927-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) also identified substitution-tolerant sites showing helical periodicity which were proposed to face the surface of the protein. Substitutions in TM12 which reduced lactose transport activity affected both tolerant and intolerant sites in the putative helix (Table III). The substitutions affecting tolerant sites were generally highly nonconservative (such as the introduction of charged residues in V384E and G391D) and are expected to cause generalized defects in membrane insertion and/or folding. Most of the inactivating substitutions markedly decreased the steady-state recovery of protein (Table III), suggesting that defective folding frequently leads to cellular proteolysis. Few inactivating changes altering TM12 have been identified previously (18Bailey J. Manoil C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 19Jung K. Jung H. Colacurcio P. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20He M.M. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12909-12914Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The earlier studies found that L385R, G386C, and L400C inactivated lac permease, whereas all of the other residues of TM12 could be converted individually into cysteine without decreasing transport greatly (19Jung K. Jung H. Colacurcio P. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20He M.M. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12909-12914Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The most surprising finding of this study was the number and variety of mutations affecting TM12 which made lac permease toxic to cells. The toxic effects were in some cases quite dramatic, reducing plating efficiencies of cells carrying mutant plasmids at low copy number greater than 104-fold. In addition, many of the toxic mutant proteins were present in cells at very low levels (undetectable in Western blotting), implying very high toxicity per molecule. The most toxic changes were frameshift mutations at sites corresponding to the sixth periplasmic domain (P6) of lacpermease. Because nonsense mutations (and some frameshift mutations) corresponding to P6 did not cause dramatic growth inhibition (Table IVand data not shown), it appears that the frameshift sequence synthesized in place of TM12 contributes to whether the resulting mutant protein is toxic or not. The substitution mutations that were toxic corresponded to changes expected to favor unfolding of the protein: the introduction of charged residues or proline, changes of glycine, or substitutions at “intolerant” sites (Table IV). Many of the toxic substitution mutant proteins retained significant transport activity (Table IV), suggesting that in some cases, toxicity is a more sensitive measure of misfolding than is loss of transport activity. Several previous studies have documented instances of mutant membrane protein toxicity. For example, it was observed that a number of hybridlac permease-alkaline phosphatase proteins inhibited growth, with toxicity increasing with the length of the hybrid (7Calamia J. Manoil C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Substitution and in-frame insertion mutations of lacpermease and the E. coli serine chemoreceptor have also been observed previously to inhibit growth (11Manoil C. Bailey J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Bailey J. Manoil C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 21Seligman L. Bailey J. Manoil C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2315-2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as have overproduced substitution mutants of yeast proton ATPase (22Harris S.L. Na S. Zhu X. Seto-Young D. Perlin D.S. Teem J.H. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10531-10535Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A simple model for mutant membrane protein toxicity is that it results from disruption of the lipid bilayer by polypeptides that insert into the bilayer but are unable to fold correctly. The resulting breakdown of the permeability barrier would kill cells or slow their growth. The effect might be analogous to that observed when cells are exposed to natural or synthetic amphipathic peptides that disrupt membranes (4Manoil C. Traxler B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 131-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,23Blondelle S. Houghton R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12688-12694Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 24Saberwal G. Nagaria R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Several degenerative diseases in humans are known to be caused by mutant integral membrane proteins, including retinitis pigmentosa and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (1Humphries P. Kenna P. Farrarr G.J. Science. 1992; 256: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Al-Maghteth M. Gregory C. Inglehearn C. Hardcastle A. Bhattacharya S. Hum.

Many of the mutations associated with these diseases are analogous to those that make lacpermease toxic. For example, mutations in the rhodopsin gene which introduce charged residues or prolines in transmembrane segments or cause frameshifts may lead to retinitis pigmentosa (1Humphries P. Kenna P. Farrarr G.J. Science. 1992; 256: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Al-Maghteth M. Gregory C. Inglehearn C. Hardcastle A. Bhattacharya S. Hum. Mutat. 1993; 2: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also suggested that frameshift derivatives of β-amyloid protein may contribute to Alzheimer's disease (25van Leeuwen F. de Kleijn D.P.V. van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Koycu S. Ramdjielal R.D.J. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). These similarities suggest that the pathogenesis of such degenerative diseases could include toxic effects analogous to those observed with mutantlac permeases.
