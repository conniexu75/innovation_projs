https://openalex.org/W2026250491,"Problems of statistical and conceptual design of experiments are exacerberated by ethical issues in many, if not most, clinical trials. Statutory requirements of demonstrated effectiveness are far from being clearly resolved--either qualitatively or quantitatively. Ethics, bolstered by informed consent, are likely to keep us from ever learning the answer to many questions. Unbalanced boundaries, focusing-down designs, historical controls, and not-very-sequential designs are among the possible consequences."

https://openalex.org/W2055020223,"Site-specific recombination is an important genetic pathway in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The range of phenomena associated with this genomic transaction in prokaryotes includes the generation and integration of episomal factors, the highly mobile antibiotic resistance elements, the influence on gene expression by small DNA insertion sequences (IS-elements), and the transition between cytoplasmic vegetative phage genomes and host-integrated prophage. Although less is known about eukaryotic systems, recent biochemical experiments and a renewed appreciation of older genetic experiments are beginning to suggest that site-specific recombination, in addition to being important in the integration of viral genomes, may also be relevant in cellular regulation or developmental pathways (or both) (1). An up-to-date collection of recent work in this area is presented in (2). One of the most thoroughly characterized examples of site-specific recombination, and also the subject of this article, is the integration and excision reaction of bacteriophage lambda (λ) (3).

According to the now well-documented model proposed by Campbell for λ integration, the infecting phage genome is first circularized by means of its cohesive termini and then undergoes a single reciprocal recombination event at specific loci (att sites) on the bacterial and viral chromosomes (4) (Fig. 1). The product of the phage gene int, which maps immediately to the right of att, is required for both integration and excision of the λ prophage (5). The excision reaction, in addition, requires the product of a second phage gene, xis, which maps immediately to the right of the int gene (6). Although no other phage-specific proteins are required (7), there are at least one or more host-specified proteins that are also involved in the integration-excision pathway (8). The enzymology of the integration-excision reaction has only recently yielded to direct biochemical analysis (9, 10), and information crucial to the formulation of a complete model will undoubtedly be forthcoming in the near future. Not included within the 1400 base-pair att-int-xis cluster are the regulatory genes cII and c-III, whose products greatly enhance the expression of the int gene, but not of xis, by mechanisms which remain to be established (11, 12).

In current nomenclature the phage (attP) and bacterial (attB) att sites are designated POP’ and BOB’, respectively, and the prophage att sites are designated BOP’ (attL) and POB’ (attR) (Fig. 1). Transducing phage carrying attL (λgal) or attR (λbio) are generated from a prophage which has excised from the host chromosome by a rare int-independent recombination which deletes phage DNA from one end of the prophage and adds bacterial DNA to the other (4). A phage carrying the bacterial att site, BOB’, is obtained as a product of int-promoted recombination between a gal (BOP’) and a bio (POB’) transducing phage which is capable of transducing gal and bio together (13).

The analysis of int-dependent recombination between phage bearing different att sites lead to the proposal by Guerrini (14) that the arms of the att sites, P, P’, B, and B’, differ from each other in nucleotide sequence, and that the extent of int-dependent recombination between different att sites does not depend on the degree of homology between them. Furthermore, all four arms of a given pair of att sites are somehow important together in determining the results of a cross (13, 15), as are the temperature and the activity of xis protein (16). Electron microscopy of appropriate heteroduplex molecules has yielded estimates for the maximum size of the postulated recognition elements, for example, less than 20 base pairs for element B (17); however, such conclusions are necessarily qualified because of the number of possible models for att site structure (18).

In addition to the unique character of each att site, the genetic results of Shulman and Gottesman (19) suggested that there is a common region, O, which is shared by all of the λ att sites. Mutants defective in att function can be crossed from one att site into another; and, since some of the progeny of a mutant by wild-type cross are heterozygous, they have postulated that the actual crossover might be made by staggered nicks in the two strands of the common core region (19, 20). Failure to find evidence of this type of homology by electron microscope heteroduplex analysis yields an upper limit of 20 to 50 base pairs for a common core region (17, 21).

When Escherichia coli carries a deletion of the gal-bio region, that is, of the primary bacterial att site BOB’, int-dependent integration of λ can be detected at numerous loci (secondary bacterial att sites) on the E. coli chromosome (22). This integration always involves the phage att site (POP’) (23) and is thus very similar to the behavior of IS-elements (24, 25). The secondary prophage att sites are given the general designation ΔOP’ and POΔ’ and they differ from BOP’ and POB’ and from each other in their biological properties as determined by int- and xis -dependent recombination frequencies with various att sites (26).

We have undertaken a study of the structures involved in site-specific integrative and excisive recombination in bacteriophage λ. In this article, we report the DNA sequences for each of the four primary att sites, POP’, POB’, BOP’, and BOB’. Our results show that the phage att site and bacterial att site have in common a sequence 15 nucleotide pairs in length. The crossover event of integrative recombination must be within the limits (or at the boundaries) of this “common core” sequence since it occurs unaltered in both the leftward and rightward prophage att sites. The four sets of sequences, adjacent to the common core region, are different from one another and hereafter will be referred to as “arms” (P arm, B’ arm, and so forth) without any implication as to their functional significance. Several features of the att site structures are discussed in terms of possible models for the site-specific recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1540815504,"DNA polymerase III holoenzyme has been purified from Escherichia coli HMS-83, using, as an assay, the conversion of coliphage G4 single-stranded DNA to the duplex replicative form. The holoenzyme consists of at least four different subunits: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta of 140,000, 40,000, 52,000, and 32,000 daltons, respectively. The alpha subunit is DNA polymerase III, the dnaE gene product. The holoenzyme has been resolved by phosphocellulose chromatography into an alpha - gamma - delta complex and a subunit beta (copolymerase III*); neither possesses detectable activity in the G4 system but together reconstitute holoenzyme-like activity. The alpha - gamma - delta complex has been further resolved to yield a gamma - delta complex which reconstitutes alpha - gamma - delta activity when added to DNA polymerase III. The gamma - delta complex contains a product of the dnaZ gene and has been purified from a strain which contains a ColE1-dnaZ hybrid plasmid."

https://openalex.org/W2096527932,"Phagokinetic tracks were used to determine the current direction of migration in 3T3 cells. Comparing this direction with the orientation of actin or tubulin-containing cellular structures by indirect immunofluorescence, the following results were obtained. First, the main actin-containing bundles were located at the bottom and tail end of 3T3 cells and ran parallel to the current or preceding direction of migration. Second, the 3 micrometer long rod-like structure (primary cilium), which contains tubulin and which has been observed by other investigators in transmission electron microscopy (Barnes, 1961; Sorokin, 1962; Wheatley, 1969) and in indirect immunofluorescence (Osborn and Weber, 1976), was oriented predominantly parallel to the substrate and to the current movement direction. It seems possible that the primary cilium has a role in the directional control of a migrating 3T3 cell, and that the main actin containing bundles act as substrate-attached rails along which the nucleus and bulk cytoplasm slide during displacement of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2043110326,"Ethical issues raised by human experimentation, especially in medicine, have been of increasing concern in the last half of the 20th century. Except for issues of consent and capacity to consent, ethical concerns raised by controlled trials center about the fact that individuals are being subjected, randomly, to different treatments. Two arguments are raised, and in each the patients are seen to be the losers. The first argument is an expression of the fear that the trial, by withholding a favorable new therapy, imposes a sacrifice on the part of some of the patients (the control group). The second argument raises the opposite concern that, by getting an untested new therapy, some patients (those in the experimental group) are exposed to additional risk. To a large extent, both arguments imply that investigators know in advance which is the favorable treatment. Some empirical evidence on these issues can be obtained by examining how potential new therapies are evaluated and what the findings are. How often do new therapies turn out to be superior when they are tested, and how much better or worse is a new therapy likely to be than the standard treatment? We have investigated such questions for surgery and anesthesia."

Results of (i) genetic experiments involving conjugal transfer and phage P1-mediated transduction and (ii) physical experiments involving electron microscopic examination of plasmid DNA and heteroduplex analysis show that a single conjugative plasmid carries the genes for drug resistance and production of enterotoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1580981982,"The reversibility and specificity of phospholipid translocation between the inner and outer membrane of Salmonella typhimurium has been investigated by incorporating exogenous lipids from phospholipid vesicles into the outer membrane of intact cells. Translocation of newly incorporated phospholipids to the inner membrane was demonstrated by decarboxylation of vesicle-derived phosphatidylserine and by recovery of vesicle constituents in both inner and outer membrane fractions. All Salmonella phospholipids tested, as well as phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl oleate were effectively translocated to the inner membrane. However, no translocation of vesicle-derived lipopolysaccharide or an incomplete biosynthetic precursor of lipid A could be detected. Translocation of phospholipids and cholesteryl ester was rapid and extensive, and appeared to lead to equilibration of the lipids between the two membranes. The mechanism of intermembrane translocation has not been established, but the results are suggestive of diffusional flow across zones of adhesion between the inner and outer membranes."

Radioimmunoassays of acidified milk indicate concentrations of GnRH ranging between 0.1 and 3 nanograms per milliliter. Multistep extractions, followed by electrophoresis, reveal gonadotropin-releasing activity in the fraction that comigrates with the GnRH-marker. A second hypothalamic hormone, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, is present in milk at a much lower concentration. ""Milk -GnRH"" may influence the secretion of the gonadotropic hormones in neonates."

Acceptance of allografts was observed for tissue exchanged between some F2 and F3 inbred animals. The percentage of acceptances reflected the degree of inbreeding. Accelerated second set rejection was also found. These grafts were rejected in one-third of the time compared to first sets.
https://openalex.org/W1544188722,"The Cro protein specified by bacteriophage lambda is a of the genes expressed early in phage development and is required for a normal late stage of lytic growth. We have purified Cro protein to virtual homogeneity and analyzed its structure and properties as a DNA-binding protein and of RNA synthesis. To confirm that the protein is the product of the cro gene, we have also shown that a missense mutation in the cro gene leads to a product that is more temperature- and salt-sensitive in its DNA-binding property. As purified, Cro protein is a dimer of identical subunits of molecular weight 8600. The purified protein binds to lambda-DNA carrying the specific binding sites (operators oL and oR) with an estimated dissociation constant of 10(-10) M to 10(-11) M; there is also weaker binding to other sites on DNA, as found for other DNA-binding regulatory proteins. In a purified transcription system, the Cro protein is an effective and specific of RNA synthesis from the N and cro genes; thus Cro is an autorepressor which regulates its own synthesis. A comparison of the properties of the two lambda proteins, cI and Cro, indicates that cI is a strong repressor specialized for complete turnoff of lytic functions needed for the maintenance of lysogeny, whereas Cro is a weak repressor specialized for a gradual turnoff of early viral genes that potentiates the late stage of lytic development."
https://openalex.org/W1513676712,"We describe the isolation of lambdafus2, which carries bacterial DNA from the str-spc region of the Escherichia coli chromosome. Genes for 27 ribosomal proteins were found on the genome of this transducing phage by identifying the ribosomal proteins whose synthesis was stimulated after infection of UV-irradiated bacteria. These were genes for S3, S4, S5, S7, S8, S10, S11, S12, S13, S14, S17, S19, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L14, L15, L16, L17, L18, L22 L23, L24, L29, and L30. Subsets of these genes were identified on the genomes of the phages lambdaspc1, lambdaspc2-delta 9, and lambdaspc2-delta16, all of which carry parts of the bacterial DNA present on lambdafus2. From the known structures of these phage genomes, it has been possible to determine the relative order of many of these genes on the lambdafus2 genome and thus on the E. coli chromosome. Our evidence also suggests that the genes for S3, S17, S19, L2, L4, L16, L22, L23, and L29 are part of a single transcription unit. These results, along with the observations described in the previous and accompanying papers, indicate that the ribosomal protein genes on lambdafus2 are organized into at least four transcription units."
https://openalex.org/W1511256877,"The four isomers of hydroxycitrate have been tested as substrates and inhibitors for citrate synthase, citrate lyase, and ATP citrate lyase. None of the isomers served as a substrate for citrate synthase and they were moderate to weak inhibitors of this reaction. Of the four isomers, only (pncit)-(2S)-2-hydroxycitrate did not serve as a substrate for citrate lyase while (pncit)-(4S)-4-hydroxycitrate was the only isomer which did not serve as a substrate for ATP citrate lyase. No consistent pattern of reactivity or inhibitor potency was seen with the different isomeric hydroxycitrates. It is proposed that more than one mode of binding is possible between the isomers and the three different active sites."
https://openalex.org/W1540675654,"A scheme is described for the large scale purification of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and glutathione reductase. The scheme is based on an initial separation of thioredoxin from the two reductases by affinity chromatography on agarose-bound N6-(6-aminohexyl)-adenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate (agarose-2',5'-ADP). The two reductases were then separated by hydrophobic chromatography and purified separately to homogeneity. Thioredoxin was purified to homogeneity by immunoadsorption to agarose containing immobilized goat anti-thioredoxin. Overall yields for thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and glutathione reductase exceeded 80% in each case. Both reductases exhibit an absorption band at approximately 320 nm which appears due to a residual amount of tightly bound NADP. Presence of this absorption band has no apparent effect on the specific activity of either enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1578918666,"Incubation of intact cells of Salmonella typhimurium with bilayer phospholipid vesicles results in significant transfer of vesicle lipids to the cells. The transfer requires Ca2+ or spermine, and is dependent on time, temperature, the concentration and composition of the vesicles, and the nature of the cellular lipopolysaccharide. The process results in bulk transfer of vesicle lipids to the cells rather than reciprocal molecular exchange between vesicles and the outer membrane. All components of mixed lipid vesicles, including cholesteryl oleate and lipopolysaccharide, are transferred to the cells in a ratio similar to that of the donor vesicles. The properties of the transfer process are consistent with direct fusion of vesicles with the outer membrane of the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1526228480,"The dG residues within the EcoRI recognition sequence of ColE1 DNA have been selectively replaced with dI. Methylation of the altered sequence by the EcoRI modification enzyme is extremely slow as compared with methyl transfer to the natural recognition site. Since the affinity of the modification enzyme for the dI-containing sequence is considerably less than that for the natural sequence, we have concluded that the 2-amino group of dG has an important role in DNA site recognition by this enzyme. In contrast, the altered site is subject to cleavage by EcoRI endonuclease at rates essentially identical with those observed with the natural sequence. These results strongly suggest that the two enzymes utilize different contacts within the EcoRI site and are consisted with our conclusion (Rubin, R. A., and Modrich, P. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 7265-7272) that the two proteins interact with their common recognition sequence in different ways."
https://openalex.org/W120073566,"A simple procedure for purifying polynucleotide phosphorylase from Escherichia coli cells by means of affinity chromatography on an RNA-Sepharose column is described. The purified enzyme preparation has a specific activity 3500-fold that of the crude extract and is essentially homogeneous, as determined by ultracentrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, isoelectric focusing and serological assays. It is virtually free of nuclease contamination, a property which permits its use in the synchronous phosphorolysis of RNA chains. The enzyme molecule is composed of three identical subunits of Mr = 84,000. Each subunit contains three cysteine residues, one of which reacts with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) whereas the two other groups are only exposed on denaturation of the protein. All three enzyme subunits participate in the processive phosphorolysis of the poly(A) tail of each globin mRNA chain. An advantageous method was developed for synchronous phosphorolysis of RNA molecules using a molar excess of polynucleotide phosphorylase immobilized onto Sepharose."
https://openalex.org/W1480237460,"The restriction endonuclease EcoR1 cleaves Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA, which codes for ribosomal RNA (rRNA), into seven fragments, A second restriction endonuclease, HindIII, cleaves the same yeast ribosomal DNA into two fragments. These two restriction enzymes each yield DNA segments that total about 5.9 megadaltons. The repeat unit of the yeast genes coding for rRNA is thus about 5.9 megadaltons or about 9000 base pairs long. The two HindIII-cleaved DNA fragments as well as one of the EcoR1-cleaved DNA fragments were purified and amplified by cloning in Escherichia coli. Three of the seven EcoR1-generated DNA fragments could then be ordered by treating the two cloned HindIII DNA fragments with EcoR1. This led the assignment of the two HindIII restriction sites. The various restriction DNA fragments were hybridized directly from the gel utilizing 32P-labeled 5 S, 5.8 S, 18 S, and 25 S rRNA. Identification of the various DNA restriction segments then led to the final ordering of the DNA fragments. The gene coding for the 5 S RNA is adjacent to the gene coding for the 35 S precursor rRNA. These two groups of genes thus occur as a cluster in the following sequence: [5 S-spacer]-[spacer-18 S-5.8 S-25 S-spacer]-[spacer-5 S]. The actual map of the DNA restriction fragments is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1996201633,"Patterns of cytoplasmic microtubules in somatic cell hybrids between transformed mouse cells and nontransformed human skin fibroblasts were examined using antitubulin antibodies as an immunofluorescent probe. Nontransformed cells have been shown to exhibit an extensive cytoplasmic microtubule complex (CMTC), while in transformed cells, this complex is greatly diminished. The hybrid populations contained both types of cells. In addition, they contained cells with previously undescribed intermediate CMTC phenotypes. The percentage of each phenotype present in hybrid populations was determined for sixteen hybrid clones. Seven clones were found which appeared transformed on the basis of their CMTC pattern. The others were comprised of various proportions of all the cell types described. Repeated quantitation of the proportions of these types in the hybrid populations showed them to be stable with time in culture. Growth in vitro of the hybrid clones was assayed by determining their saturation densities, their plating efficiencies on plastic and their colony-forming abilities in soft agar. In vitro growth of a cell population was found to be directly proportional to the percentage of cells in the population which showed the greatly diminished CMTC pattern which has been described for transformed cells. This is strong evidence that a greatly reduced CMTC is associated with transformed behavior, especially the increased capacity of transformed cells for in vitro growth."

Apo- and holoenzyme are inactivated at the same rate, and inactivation of both is correlated with modification of 2 arginine residues/tryptophanase monomer. Substrate analogs having a carboxyl group protect the holoenzyme against both inactivation and arginine modification but have no effect on the inactivation or modification of the apoenzyme. Phenylglyoxal-modified apotryptophanase retains the capacity to bind the coenzyme, pyridoxal-P, but the spectrum of this reconstituted species differs from that of native holotryptophanase. Neither this reconstituted species nor the phenyglyoxal-modified holoenzyme shows the 500 nm absorption characteristic of the native enzyme when substrates are added.

Studies with mutant strains defective in the synthesis of various nucleoside diphosphate sugars have now revealed that UDP-glucose is an essential intermediate in the biosynthesis of these oligosaccharides. Mutants unable to synthesize UDP-glucose do not contain significant amounts of the membrane-derived oligosaccharides. In contrast, a strain unable to synthesize ADP-glucose, the glucosyl donor for glycogen synthesis in E. coli, contained normal amounts of the membrane-derived oligosaccharides, although with a somewhat different pattern of distribution of the various subspecies. In confirmation of these genetic studies, pulse-label isotope tracer studies have been carried out with glucose of high specific activity, under conditions in which UDP-glucose comprises a large fraction of the total radioactivity in the low molecular weight pool.

https://openalex.org/W1486725850,"Removal of interstrand cross-linked from DNA was examined in Escherichia coli permeabilized by treatment with toluene. Under these conditions, the reaction requires ATP and Mg2+, and the mechanism appears to be similar to that occurring in whole cells. Under optimum conditions, the rate constant was 0.06 min-1. Genetical, physical, and biochemical analysis of the repair process suggest the following mechanism. In an ATP-dependent reaction, the uvrA and uvrB gene products cleave a phosphodiester bond on the 5' side of one arm of the cross-link, producing a 3'-OH terminus. Subsequently, DNA polymerase I (5'-3' exonuclease activity) makes a second strand cut on the 3' side of the cross-link in the same DNA strand, completing removal of the covalent link between complementary strands. The second reaction did not occur in a uvrD- strain, which had normal levels of DNA polymerizing activity.

The sizes and locations of the insertions on the phage genomes were determined by heteroduplex analysis. They were found to be located at different positions in the Spc transcription unit. The effect of these insertions on the expression of the ribosomal protein genes carried by these phages in ultraviolet light-irradiated bacteria was investigated. The insertions at intermediate positions in the transcription unit reduced the expression of some of the genes in the unit but not others. Assuming that the genes whose expressions were reduced are distal to the insertion, it was possible to determine the relative position of most of the genes in the unit. The results indicate the order of genes in the Spc transcription unit is: promoter, L14, L24, L5, S14, S8, L6, L18, (S5, L15, L30)."
https://openalex.org/W1484224579,"The regulation of uracil uptake in bacteria was studied in bacteriophage T4-infected cells, where host-specific, stable RNA synthesis is completely shut-off by phage, and where phage-specific RNA synthesis, which is not stringently regulated, could be followed by a continuous incorporation of uracil. This incorporation into phage RNA was found to be dependent on the allelic state of the rel gene and it was thus severely restricted under stringent conditions. This was not the case with adenine, which was incorported into RNA to almost the same extent under stringent and relaxed conditions, respectively. The inhibition of uracil uptake under proceeding RNA formation, which was furthermore found to be reversed by addition of chloramphenicol, indicated a specific mechanism governing the cellular entry of uracil. This is suggested to involve the allosteric regulation of uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.9.). The enzyme was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel chromatography. The dependence on GDP and GTP as positive effectors was demonstrated. The stimulatory effect of GTP was abolished in vitro by the addition of guanosine 5'-diphosphate 3-diphosphate, which is known to accumulate during amino acid starvation in stringent bacteria. The reversible inactivation of the enzyme by dilution suggested a subunit structure of uracil phosphoribosyltransferase."

Methylation of these sites proceeded stepwise, progressing to a stable ratio of 0.93:1.0:0.17 for N epsilon-mono-, N epsilon-di-, and N epsilon-trimethyllysine in histone H3 and 0.19:1.0 for N epsilon-mono- and N epsilon-dimethyllysine in histone H4. The Km values of the enzyme for S-adenosyl-L-methionine were 11.5 +/- 1.1 micron and 12.5 +/- 1.3 micron with histones H3 and H4 as methyl acceptors, respectively. The Vmax values were 11.1 and 5.3 pmol of 3H-methyl incorporated/min/mg of histone H3 and H4, respectively. Since histone H3 contains 2 mol of N epsilon-methyllysine/mol and histone H4 contains 1 mol/mol, no difference in the overall rates of methylation can be deduced from the data. S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine, one of the products of the reaction, was a competitive inhibitor with respect to S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The Ki values for S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine were 5.5 +/- 0.4 micron and 5.9 +/- 0.5 micron with histones H3 and H4 as methyl acceptors, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2088272106,"Scientific medical ethics are founded on the moral principles and stan? dards of reason that are a part of ethics generally, and on the cumulative wisdom and experience of scientific knowledge and practice (/). Scien? tists of every persuasion, ethicists, philosophers, lawyers, sociologists, economists, and representatives from all walks of life play a role in the shaping of these ethics (7). Ethics is that branch of philosophy relating to human conduct, to the lightness and wrongness of certain actions, and to the good and bad of the motives and ends of such actions. Silverman, in his article on retrolental fibroplasia (2) points out that this epidemic of blindness in infants has a moral, not only for medical experimentation on human beings [(see (3, 4)], but also for self-experimentation by the public such as that with laetrile (amygda lin), and with megavitamin therapy, with increased reports of toxicity (5, 6). As Silverman points out (2), it is an irony of medicine that the retrolental fibroplasia stemmed from the efforts of physicians to in? crease the premature baby's chances of survival in good health. After about 12 years of intensive investigation of this epidemic of blindness, the cause was found, and the disease was virtually eradicated. The entire episode sharply presents the painful questions that surround experimentation with human beings, and particularly with newborn infants. When this epidemic appeared, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was tried because of its effect on fibrous tissue formation, since the formation of such tissue behind the lens of the eye appeared to be the proximate cause of the blindness in these infants. It seemed curative in three-quarters of the infants on whom it was tried, and was hailed as a therapy for this epidemic. We now know that this disease relates to the oxygen-rich environment that was then standard treat? ment for premature infants, and that approximately three-fourths of the infants with early eye changes will return spontaneously to normal,"

https://openalex.org/W1499802278,"Transfer RNAs isolated from Escherichia coli B grown in the presence of 2-thiouracil are deficient in pseudouridine. Much of this deficiency is from the T psi C region, which has only about 50% of its normal pseudouridine content. The other modified nucleoside from this region, ribothymidine, is reduced by only about 10%. Studies showed that 2-thiouracil is incoproated into the RNA of E. coli during growth in the presence of the analog. This incorporation appears to result from the replacement of uracil, occur in a random manner, and involve all RNA species. The extent of incorporation varies from 1 to 3 mol %, depending upon the preparation and RNA species examined. Electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels and chromatography on Sephadex G-75 and reverse phase (Systen 5) columns of normal and 2-thiouracil-containing tRNAs revealed no profile differences. No accumulation of any precursor tRNA in the thiopyrimidine-treated cells is found. A partial recovery of the pseudouridine content of 2-thiouracil-containing tRNAs can be achieved in vivo by removal of the 2-thiouracil from the culture media. These transfer RNAs have also been used as substrates to study the properties of a partially purified preparation of pseudouridine synthetase II invitro and should be useful as substrates in the further purification of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1501777141,"Ornithine transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli, strain W, exhibits negative cooperativity with respect to ornithine, and the enzymatic activity is further regulated by orotate. The effect of orotate on ornithine transcarbamylase is dependent not only upon the carbamylphosphate concentration, but also upon the concentration of ornithine. At high concentrations of carbamylphosphate (10 mM), a conversion from negative cooperativity to positive cooperativity is observed with 10 mM orotate. At 1 mM carbamylphosphate, however, 10 mM orotate activates the enzyme at low ornithine concentrations, but as the ornithine concentration is increased above 5 mM, inhibition is observed. Thus, a regulatory link has been established between the pathways of arginine biosynthesis and pyrimidine biosynthesis, each of which utilizes carbamylphosphate."

https://openalex.org/W22642432,"The new form of valyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.9) that appears immediately after infection of Escherichia coli with bacteriophage T4 was purified and subjected to mild proteolysis using five different proteases. The inactivation of aminoacylation activity was both more extensive and rapid than that obtained with valyl-tRNA synthetase purified from uninfected E. coli. The addition of bulk tRNA from E. coli B protected the phage-specific form of valyl-tRNA synthetase from proteolysis, but ATP and valine did not exhibit a similar protective effect. The characteristic property of phage-modified valyl-tRNA synthetase, resistance to denaturation by 4 M urea, remained unaffected during treatment with trypsin. This suggested that the phage-specific factor tau, known to be associated with the synthetase in phage-infected cells, was protected from proteolysis in the synthetase-tau complex. Comparison by isoelectric focusing of normal valyl-tRNA synthetase, the phage-specific form of this enzyme, and phage enzyme from which tau had been removed, revealed no differences in the isoelectric points of these three molecules. Based on these results a model was drawn for the structural changes occurring in valyl-tRNA synthetase after association with the phage factor tau."
