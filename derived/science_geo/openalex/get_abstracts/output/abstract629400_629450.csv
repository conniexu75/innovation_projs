https://openalex.org/W2921061344,"How do large-mammal communities reassemble after being pushed to the brink of extinction? Few data are available to answer this question, as it is rarely possible to document both the decline and recovery of wildlife populations. Here we present the first in-depth quantitative account of war-induced collapse and postwar recovery in a diverse assemblage of large herbivores. In Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park, we assembled data from 15 aerial wildlife counts conducted before (1968-1972) and after (1994-2018) the Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992). Pre-war total biomass density exceeded 9,000 kg km-2, but populations declined by >90% during the war. Since 1994, total biomass has substantially recovered, but species composition has shifted dramatically. Formerly dominant large herbivores-including elephant (Loxodonta africana), hippo (Hippopotamus amphibius), buffalo (Syncerus caffer), zebra (Equus quagga), and wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus)-are now outnumbered by waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) and other small to mid-sized antelopes. Waterbuck abundance has increased by an order of magnitude, with >55,000 individuals accounting for >74% of large-herbivore biomass in 2018. By contrast, elephant, hippo, and buffalo, which totaled 89% of pre-war biomass, now comprise just 23%. These trends mostly reflect natural population growth following the resumption of protection under the Gorongosa Restoration Project; reintroductions (465 animals of 7 species) accounted for a comparatively small fraction of the total numerical increase. Waterbuck are growing logistically, apparently as-yet unchecked by interspecific competition or predation (apex-carnivore abundance has been low throughout the post-war interval), suggesting a community still in flux. Most other herbivore populations have increased post-war, albeit at differing rates. Armed conflict remains a poorly understood driver of ecological change; our results demonstrate the potential for rapid post-war recovery of large-herbivore biomass, given sound protected-area management, but also suggest that restoration of community structure takes longer and may require active intervention."

Volumetric imaging approaches, such as multiphoton microscopy, are able to generate detailed 3D images of blood vessels that could contribute to our understanding of the role of vascular structure in normal physiology and in disease mechanisms. The segmentation of vessels, a core image analysis problem, is a bottleneck that has prevented the systematic comparison of 3D vascular architecture across experimental populations. We explored the use of convolutional neural networks to segment 3D vessels within volumetric in vivo images acquired by multiphoton microscopy. We evaluated different network architectures and machine learning techniques in the context of this segmentation problem. We show that our optimized convolutional neural network architecture with a customized loss function, which we call DeepVess, yielded a segmentation accuracy that was better than state-of-the-art methods, while also being orders of magnitude faster than the manual annotation. To explore the effects of aging and Alzheimer’s disease on capillaries, we applied DeepVess to 3D images of cortical blood vessels in young and old mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease and wild type littermates. We found little difference in the distribution of capillary diameter or tortuosity between these groups, but did note a decrease in the number of longer capillary segments (>75μm) in aged animals as compared to young, in both wild type and Alzheimer’s disease mouse models."
https://openalex.org/W2922416496,"The objective of the study was to evaluate role of zeolite and Enterobacter sp. MN17 on Cd uptake, growth, physiological and biochemical responses of Brassica napus on Cd-contaminated soil. A sandy clay loam soil in plastic pots was spiked with Cd (0 and 80 mg kg-1) and amended with zeolite (0 and 10 g kg-1). Seeds of B. napus were inoculated with Enterobacter sp. MN17. Both inoculated and non-inoculated seeds of B. napus were sown and plants were harvested after 60 days of growth and data were collected. Although sole application of zeolite and seed inoculation reverted adverse effects of Cd in B. napus plants, the combined use resulted in even higher growth and physiological responses compared to control plants. The combined use under Cd stress increased plant height, root length, dry biomass of shoot and root up to 32%, 57%, 42% and 64%, respectively compared to control. The different physiological attributes (photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance) of B. napus were improved from 6% to 137%. Moreover, combined use of zeolite and seed inoculation on Cd-contaminated soil reduced the stress to plants as antioxidant activities decreased up to 25-64%, however enzyme activities were still higher than plants grown on normal soil. Root and shoot analysis of B. napus for Cd content depicted that zeolite and bacterium decreased Cd uptake from soil. It is concluded that combined use of zeolite and strain MN17 reduces Cd uptake from soil and improves physiological and biochemical responses of B. napus which is helpful to alleviate Cd toxicity to plants."
https://openalex.org/W2921137266,"Aims Numerous healthcare decisions are faced by persons with advanced cancer from diagnosis to end-of-life. The family caregiver role in these decisions has focused on being a surrogate decision-maker, however, little is known about the caregiver’s role in supporting upstream patient decision-making. We aimed to describe the roles of family caregivers in assisting community-dwelling advanced cancer patients with healthcare decision-making across settings and contexts. Methods Qualitative study using one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with community-dwelling persons with metastatic cancer (n = 18) and their family caregivers (n = 20) recruited from outpatient oncology clinics of a large tertiary care academic medical center, between October 2016 and October 2017. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Findings Caregivers averaged 56 years and were mostly female (95%), white (85%), and the patient’s partner/spouse (70%). Patients averaged 58 years and were mostly male (67%) in self-reported “fair” or “poor” health (50%) with genitourinary (33%), lung (17%), and hematologic (17%) cancers. Themes describing family member roles in supporting patients’ upstream healthcare decision-making were: 1) seeking information about the cancer, its trajectory, and treatments options; 2) ensuring family and healthcare clinicians have a common understanding of the patient’s treatment plan and condition; 3) facilitating discussions with patients about their values and the framing of their illness; 5) posing “what if” scenarios about current and potential future health states and treatments; 6) addressing collateral decisions (e.g., work arrangements) resulting from medical treatment choices; 6) originating healthcare-related decision points, including decisions about seeking emergency care; and 7) making healthcare decisions for patients who preferred to delegate healthcare decisions to their family caregivers. Conclusions These findings highlight a previously unreported and understudied set of critical decision partnering roles that cancer family caregivers play in patient healthcare decision-making. Optimizing these roles may represent novel targets for early decision support interventions for family caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W2921479043,"Gentrification is multidimensional and complex, but there is general agreement that visible changes to neighbourhoods are a clear manifestation of the process. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning provide a unique opportunity to support automated mapping or ‘deep mapping’ of perceptual environmental attributes. We present a Siamese convolutional neural network (SCNN) that automatically detects gentrification-like visual changes in temporal sequences of Google Street View (GSV) images. Our SCNN achieves 95.6% test accuracy and is subsequently applied to GSV sequences at 86110 individual properties over a 9-year period in Ottawa, Canada. We use Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to produce maps that illustrate where the spatial concentration of visual property improvements was highest within the study area at different times from 2007–2016. We find strong concordance between the mapped SCNN results and the spatial distribution of building permits in the City of Ottawa from 2011 to 2016. Our mapped results confirm those urban areas that are known to be undergoing gentrification as well as revealing areas undergoing gentrification that were previously unknown. Our approach differs from previous works because we examine the atomic unit of gentrification, namely, the individual property, for visual property improvements over time and we rely on KDE to describe regions of high spatial intensity that are indicative of gentrification processes."
https://openalex.org/W2921186291,"Systematic monitoring of pasture quantity and quality is important to match the herd forage demand (pasture removal by grazing or harvest) to the supply of forage with adequate nutritive value. The aim of this research was to monitor, assess and manage changes in pasture growth, morphology and digestibility by integrating information from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and two process-based models. The first model, Systems Approach to Land Use Sustainability (SALUS), is a process-based crop growth model used to predict pasture regrowth based on soil, climate, and management data. The second model, Morphogenetic and Digestibility of Pasture (MDP), uses paddock-scale values of herbage mass as input to predict leaf morphogenesis and forage nutritive value. Two field experiments were carried out on tall fescue- and ryegrass-based pastures under rotational grazing with lactating dairy cattle. The first experiment was conducted at plot scale and was used to calibrate the UAV and to test models. The second experiment was conducted at field scale and was used to test the UAV's ability to predict pasture biomass under grazing rotation. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from the UAV's multispectral reflectance (n = 72) was strongly correlated (p < 0.001) to plot measurements of pasture biomass (R2 = 0.80) within the range of ~226 and 4208 kg DM ha-1. Moreover, there was no difference (root mean square error, RMSE < 500 kg DM ha-1) between biomass estimations by the UAV (1971±350 kg ha-1) and two conventional methods used as control, the C-Dax proximal sensor (2073±636 kg ha-1) and ruler (2017±530 kg ha-1). The UAV approach was capable of mapping at high resolution (6 cm) the spatial variability of pasture (16 ha). The integrated UAV-modeling approach properly predicted spatial and temporal changes in pasture biomass (RMSE = 509 kg DM ha-1, CCC = 0.94), leaf length (RMSE = 6.2 cm, CCC = 0.62), leaf stage (RMSE = 0.7 leaves, CCC = 0.65), neutral detergent fiber (RMSE = 3%, CCC = 0.71), digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (RMSE = 8%, CCC = 0.92) and digestibility of dry matter (RMSE = 5%, CCC = 0.93) with reasonable precision and accuracy. These findings therefore suggest potential for the present UAV-modeling approach for use as decision support tool to allocate animals based on spatially and temporally explicit predictions of pasture biomass and nutritive value."
https://openalex.org/W2921826057,"Corn gluten meal (CGM) is an important alternative protein source in aquafeed production. However, in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), CGM could not be effectively utilized because of its low digestibility, the reason for which is still unclear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate and elucidate the cause for the poor utilization of CGM by turbot from the view of gut health. An 8-week feeding trial was conducted with turbot individuals (initial body weight 11.4 ± 0.2 g), which were fed with one of four isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets formulated to include 0%, 21.2%, 31.8%, and 42.6% CGM to progressively replace 0%, 33%, 50%, and 67% fish meal (FM) protein in a FM-based diet, respectively. The results showed that CGM caused dose-dependent decreases in (1) growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and feed utilization; (2) activities of brush-border membrane enzymes; (3) intestinal antioxidant indices of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase activities, and reduced glutathione level; (4) intestinal immune parameters of acid phosphatase activity, complement 3, complement 4, and IgM concentrations. Dose-dependent increases in the severity of the inflammation, with concomitant alterations on microvilli structure and increasing expression of inflammatory cytokine genes of Il-1β, Il-8, and Tnf-α were observed but without a change in the intracellular junctions and the epithelial permeability established by the plasma diamine oxidase activity and D-lactate level examinations. In conclusion, the present work proved that CGM negatively affected the gut health of turbot by inducing enteritis and by decreasing intestinal immunity and antioxidant capacity, which could be one of the reasons for the reduced utilization of CGM by turbot."

Noisy data and non-stationarity information are the two key factors in financial time series prediction. This paper proposes twin support vector regression for financial time series prediction to deal with noisy data and nonstationary information. Various interesting financial time series datasets across a wide range of industries, such as information technology, the stock market, the banking sector, and the oil and petroleum sector, are used for numerical experiments. Further, to test the accuracy of the prediction of the time series, the root mean squared error and the standard deviation are computed, which clearly indicate the usefulness and applicability of the proposed method. The twin support vector regression is computationally faster than other standard support vector regression on the given 44 datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2920832268,"Regenerative medicine has received a lot of attention as a novel strategy for injuries and diseases that are difficult to cure using current techniques. Cell production, which is vital for regenerative medicine, has undergone remarkable progress via breakthroughs in developmental biology and tissue engineering; currently, cell production requires numerous experimental operators performing manual, small-scale cell cultures. Other major obstacles for cell production and regenerative medicine include the variable quality of products based on the experimental procedure, the skills of operators, the level of labor required for production, and costs. Technological developments are required to overcome this, including automation instead of manual culture. Age-related macular regeneration (AMD) is a refractory ocular disease that causes severe deterioration in central vision due to senescence in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Recently, we performed an autologous transplantation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived RPE cell sheets and started clinical research on allografts from RPE cell suspensions differentiated from iPS cells. The use of regenerative therapies for AMD using iPS cell-derived RPE is expected to become more widespread. In the present study, human iPS cell-derived RPE cells were cultured to form RPE cell sheets using equipment with a closed culture module. The quality of the automated cultured RPE cell sheets was confirmed by comparing their morphological and biological properties with those of manually generated RPE cell sheets. As a result, machine-cultured RPE sheets displayed the same quality as manually cultured RPE sheets, showing that iPS cell-derived RPE cell sheets were successfully cultured by an automated process."
https://openalex.org/W2921414695,"Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment. The aim of this study was to elucidate the long-term outcomes of adult patients with AKI who receive ECMO. Materials and methods The study analyzed encrypted datasets from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. The data of 3251 patients who received first-time ECMO treatment between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2013, were analyzed. Characteristics and outcomes were compared between patients who required dialysis for AKI (D-AKI) and those who did not in order to evaluate the impact of D-AKI on long-term mortality and major adverse kidney events. Results Of the 3251 patients, 54.1% had D-AKI. Compared with the patients without D-AKI, those with D-AKI had higher rates of all-cause mortality (52.3% vs. 33.3%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53–2.17), chronic kidney disease (13.7% vs. 8.1%; adjusted subdistribution HR [aSHR] 1.66, 95% CI 1.16–2.38), and end-stage renal disease (5.2% vs. 0.5%; aSHR 14.28, 95% CI 4.67–43.62). The long-term mortality of patients who survived more than 90 days after discharge was 22.0% (153/695), 32.3% (91/282), and 50.0% (10/20) in the patients without D-AKI, with recovery D-AKI, and with nonrecovery D-AKI who required long-term dialysis, respectively, demonstrating a significant trend (Pfor trend <0.001). Conclusion AKI is associated with an increased risk of long-term mortality and major adverse kidney events in adult patients who receive ECMO."
https://openalex.org/W2922271730,"Background Psychological distress including depression and anxiety are among the most serious causes of morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh. There has been no study in the rural area to report the prevalence of and risk factors for psychological distress. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of and risk factors for psychological distress in a rural district in Bangladesh. Methods A total of 2425 adults (1249 women) aged 18–90 years were selected from the Narail upazilla using multi-level cluster random sampling for a cross-sectional study. Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler 10 items questionnaire. Participants’ socio-demographic status, life style factors and health conditions were also collected. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for binary outcomes and mean changes for continuous outcomes of psychological distress score were computed. Logistic regression and generalized linear model techniques were used for analytical purpose. Results The overall prevalence of psychological distress was 52.5%. This proportion included 22.7% people rated as having mild psychological distress, 20.8% moderate and 9.0% severe. The prevalence of moderate (24.7% vs. 17.5%, p<0.001) and severe (16.2% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001) psychological distress was significantly higher in older adults of age 60–90 years than that in younger adults of age 18–59 years. The prevalence of severe psychological distress was higher in females than males and the difference increased with age (vs. (females vs males: 1.9% vs. 1.1% at age of <30 years, 12.2% vs. 10.1% at age between 60–69 years, and 45.5% vs. 25.4% at age of 80 years or older). After multivariate adjustment, compared to degree or equivalent level of education, no education (odds ratio (OR), 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03–2.82) was associated with higher prevalence of any psychological distress in the total sample. Compared to married, psychological distress among widowed older adults was almost five times higher prevalence (OR, 4.89, 95% CI, 2.51–9.55). Socio-economic status showed a U-shaped relationship with the prevalence of psychological distress; being very poor or wealthy was associated with higher prevalence of psychological distress compared to those of moderate socio-economic status. People living in pourashava (semi-urban areas) reported significantly higher prevalence of psychological distress compared to people living in typical rural unions. Conclusions In this rural Bangladeshi community, the prevalence of psychological distress was high, especially among older women. Factors including lower level of education, inability to work, and living in semi-urban areas were associated with higher prevalence of psychological distress. Public health programmes should target people in high risk groups to reduce their psychological distress in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W2922428802,"Light driven primary production by plants is the main source of biomass in terrestrial ecosystems. But also in subsurface habitats like aquifers, life is fueled largely by this plant-derived biomass. Here, we investigate the degradation of plant-derived polysaccharides in a groundwater microbiome to identify the microbial key players involved, and compare them to those from soil of the groundwater recharge area. We quantified the activities of enzymes degrading the abundant plant polymers starch, cellulose and hemicellulose in oligotrophic groundwater samples, despite the low cell numbers present. Normalized to 16S rRNA gene copy numbers, these activities were only one order of magnitude lower than in soil. Stimulation of the groundwater microbiome with either starch or cellulose and hemicellulose led to changes of the enzymatic activity ratios, indicating autochthonous production of enzymes in response to the plant polymers. Furthermore, DNA stable isotope probing with 13C labelled plant polymers allowed us to identify microbes involved in the degradation of these compounds. In (hemi)cellulose microcosms, Bacteroidia and Candidatus Parcubacteria were active, while the active community in starch microcosms mostly comprised Candidatus Saccharibacteria, Cytophagia, and Actinobacteria. Not a single one of the active OTUs was also found to be labelled in soil microcosms. This indicates that the degradation of plant-derived polysaccharides in groundwater is driven by organisms completely distinct from those active in soil. The involvement of members of the candidate phyla Cand. Parcubacteria and Cand. Saccharibacteria, organisms known to be abundant in groundwater, in plant-derived organic matter degradation might strongly impact subsurface carbon cycling."

The introduction of DSM-5 necessitated revision of existing INDT-ASD tool to incorporate the DSM-5 related changes. This study was undertaken to develop and validate the DSM-5 based All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)-Modified-INDT-ASD Tool. The modifications were done using Delphi method and included: (a) rearrangement of questions from the previous tool; and (b) addition of new questions on sensory symptoms. The modified tool was validated against DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the cut-off for total score as compared to Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score to grade the severity of ASD. Two-hundred-twenty-five children (159 boys, median age = 47months) were enrolled. The modified tool demonstrated sensitivity of 98.4% and specificity of 91.7% to diagnose ASD. A score ≥14 on the tool was suggestive of severe ASD (CARS>36.5) with a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 80.7% respectively [Area under the curve = 0.89]. AIIMS-Modified-INDT-ASD Tool is a simple and structured instrument based on DSM-5 criteria which can facilitate diagnosis of ASD with acceptable diagnostic accuracy."

Whether higher RDW or the related parameter standard deviation of the red blood cell distribution (SD-RBC) can predict a broader range of outcomes in the general population is unknown.To evaluate the association of RDW and SD-RBC with the risk of adverse outcomes in people from the general population.Population-based retrospective cohort study.Health care system in a Canadian province (Alberta).All 3,156,863 adults living in Alberta, Canada with at least one measure of RDW and SD-RBC between 2003 and 2016. Data were analyzed in September 2018.RDW and SD-RBC, classified into percentiles (<1, 1-5, 5-25, 25-75, 75-95, 95-99, >99).All-cause death, first myocardial infarction, first stroke or transient ischemic attack, placement into long-term care (LTC), progression to renal replacement therapy (initiation of chronic dialysis or pre-emptive kidney transplantation), incident solid malignancy, and first hospitalization during follow-up.Over median follow-up of 6.8 years, 209,991 of 3,156,863 participants (6.7%) died. The risk of death increased with increasing RDW percentile. After adjustment, and compared to RDW in the 25th to 75th percentiles, the risk of death was lower for participants in the <25th percentiles but higher for participants in the 75th-95th percentiles (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.40,1.43), the 95th-99th percentiles (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.83,1.89) and the >99th percentile (HR 2.18, 95% CI 2.12,2.23). Similar results were observed for MI, stroke/TIA, incident cancer, hospitalization and LTC placement, but no association was found between RDW and ESRD. Findings were generally similar for SD-RBC, except that all associations tended to be stronger than for RDW, and both lower and higher values of SD-RBC were independently associated with ESRD.RDW and SD-RBC may be useful as prognostic markers for people in the general population, especially for outcomes related to chronic illness. SD-RBC may be superior to RDW."
https://openalex.org/W2922170633,"The fundamental test for male infertility, semen analysis, is mostly a manually performed subjective and time-consuming process and the use of automated systems has been cost prohibitive. We have previously developed an inexpensive smartphone-based system for at-home male infertility screening through automatic and rapid measurement of sperm concentration and motility. Here, we assessed the feasibility of using a similar smartphone-based system for laboratory use in measuring: a) Hyaluronan Binding Assay (HBA) score, a quantitative score describing the sperm maturity and fertilization potential in a semen sample, b) sperm viability, which assesses sperm membrane integrity, and c) sperm DNA fragmentation that assesses the degree of DNA damage. There was good correlation between the manual analysis and smartphone-based analysis for the HBA score when the device was tested with 31 fresh, unprocessed human semen samples. The smartphone-based approach performed with an accuracy of 87% in sperm classification when the HBA score was set at manufacturer's threshold of 80. Similarly, the sperm viability and DNA fragmentation tests were also shown to be compatible with the smartphone-based system when tested with 102 and 47 human semen samples, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2920893482,"Recent findings established a link between DNA sequence composition and interphase chromatin architecture and explained the evolutionary conservation of TADs (Topologically Associated Domains) and LADs (Lamina Associated Domains) in mammals. This prompted us to analyse conformation capture and recombination rate data to study the relationship between chromatin architecture and recombination landscape of human and mouse genomes. The results reveal that: (1) low recombination domains and blocks of elevated linkage disequilibrium tend to coincide with TADs and isochores, indicating co-evolving regulatory elements and genes in insulated neighbourhoods; (2) double strand break (DSB) and recombination frequencies increase in the short loops of GC-rich TADs, whereas recombination cold spots are typical of LADs and (3) the binding and loading of proteins, which are critical for DSB and meiotic recombination (SPO11, DMC1, H3K4me3 and PRMD9) are higher in GC-rich TADs. One explanation for these observations is that the occurrence of DSB and recombination in meiotic cells are associated with compositional and epigenetic features (genomic code) that influence DNA stiffness/flexibility and appear to be similar to those guiding the chromatin architecture in the interphase nucleus of pre-leptotene cells."

https://openalex.org/W2921718458,"Objective To enhance the understanding of long-term participation in working-aged people 7–8 years after stroke. Methods This study had a qualitative design, using a thematic analysis methodology. Eleven individuals took part in an in depth interview 7–8 years after a first time stroke. They had received care at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, and were recruited as a heterogenic sample with respect to age, gender, stroke severity and subtype. Results From the participants’ experiences four themes emerged: “Returning to work after stroke”; “Working life 7–8 years after stroke”; “Social life 7–8 years after stroke”; and “A state of reorientation in life”. Quotes about experienced participation in everyday life were summarized and presented as “Participation after stroke narratives”. Participants chose to emphasize on work- and social life when describing situations of successful participation. Being included in the wider community and having a sense of purpose, when interacting with others, were factors that these narratives had in common. Participants had gradually become accustomed to a somewhat altered life situation. Some consequences after stroke were still considered frustrating in social or work situations. However, the importance of these issues had reduced and were no longer problematized. Conclusions Participants felt content with their everyday life in general, which was a principal and positive result of this study. Reaching a stage of acceptance seemed to be a complex and continuous struggle, and an individual approach in long-term rehabilitation would be valuable to support this personal process. More knowledge about what factors that facilitate participation in people of working-age many years after stroke is needed, so that more people can reach a state of positive identity and participation."
https://openalex.org/W2921923911,"Shark meat is consumed as a food source worldwide, especially in Asian countries. However, since sharks are apex predators in the ocean food chain, they are prone to bioaccumulation of heavy metals. More than 100 million sharks are caught annually for human consumption, and the safety of shark meat cannot be overemphasized. Here, we examined heavy metal concentration in the muscle tissue of 6 shark species including 3 migratory species (Carcharhinus brachyurus, Carcharhinus obscurus, and Isurus oxyrinchus) and 3 local species (Triakis scyllium, Mustelus manazo, and Cephaloscyllium umbratile) from fish markets in Jeju Island, Republic of Korea. The concentrations of 11 heavy metals (Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Sn, Sb, Pb, and Hg) and MeHg were analyzed. The result showed that the average concentrations of all metals, except for that of As, were below the regulatory maximum limits of many organizations, including the Codex standard. Hg and MeHg were significantly correlated with body length, body weight, and age, and the concentration of Hg was expected to exceed the limit in C. brachyurus with a body length or weight of over 130 cm or 25 kg, respectively. Our results indicate that shark meat can expose consumers to a high level of As and that copper sharks bigger than the predicted size should be avoided for excessive Hg. Considering these findings, a detailed guideline on consumption of meat of different shark species should be suggested based on further investigation."

We compared bird density and time spent foraging in two similar bays with contrasting disturbance levels: human presence (mostly seaweed harvesters accompanied by dogs) was on average 0.9±0.4 people per 10 ha in the disturbed bay, whereas it was negligible (95% days absent) in the non-disturbed bay. Although overall abundances were similar between bays, godwit density was higher in the non-disturbed bay throughout the low tide period. Both days after the start of the non-breeding season and tidal height significantly affected godwit density, with different effects in either bay. Time spent foraging was significantly higher in the non-disturbed bay (86.5±1.1%) than in the disturbed one (81.3±1.4%). As expected, godwit density significantly decreased with the number of people and accompanying dogs in the disturbed bay. Our results indicate that even a low density of people and dogs can significantly reduce the foraging opportunities of shorebirds. These constraints, coupled with additional flushing costs, may negatively affect godwits' pre-migratory fattening. Hence, as a first step we suggest limiting human presence within bays on Chiloé to 1 person per 10 ha and banning the presence of accompanying dogs in sensitive conservation areas."
https://openalex.org/W2921097625,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs highly relevant as biomarkers for disease. A seminal study that explored the role of miRNAs in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) demonstrated their usefulness in clinical management. Nevertheless, the miRNAs that may act as endogenous controls (ECs) have not yet been established. The identification of ECs would contribute to the standardization of these biomarkers in OSA. The objective of the study is to identify miRNAs that can be used as ECs in OSA. We evaluated 100 patients divided into two different cohorts: a learning cohort of 10 non-OSA and 30 OSA patients, and a validation cohort (20 non-OSA and 40 OSA patients). In the learning cohort, a profile of 188 miRNAs was determined in plasma by TaqMan Low Density Array. The best EC candidates were identified by mean center+SD normalization and concordance correlation restricted normalization. The results were validated using NormFinder and geNorm to assess the stability of those ECs. Eight miRNAs were identified as EC candidates. The combination miRNA-106a/miRNA-186 was identified as the most stable among all candidates. We identified a set of ECs to be used in the determination of circulating miRNA in OSA that may contribute to the homogeneity of results."
https://openalex.org/W2899354026,"Due to low labeling efficiency and structural heterogeneity in fluorescence-based single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), image alignment and quantitative analysis is often required to make accurate conclusions on the spatial relationships between proteins. Cryo-electron microscopy (EM) image alignment procedures have been applied to average structures taken with super-resolution microscopy. However, unlike cryo-EM, the much larger cellular structures analyzed by super-resolution microscopy are often heterogeneous, resulting in misalignment. And the light-microscopy image library is much smaller, which makes classification challenging. To overcome these two challenges, we developed a method to deform semi-flexible ring-shaped structures and then align the 3D structures without classification. These algorithms can register semi-flexible structures with an accuracy of several nanometers in short computation time and with greatly reduced memory requirements. We demonstrated our methods by aligning experimental Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) images of ciliary distal appendages and simulated structures. Symmetries, dimensions, and locations of protein complexes in 3D are revealed by the alignment and averaging for heterogeneous, tilted, and under-labeled structures."
https://openalex.org/W2920888651,"This study examines the prevalence and correlates of stroke among older adults in Ghana. This cross-sectional study retrieved data from Wave 1 of the World Health Organization (WHO) Survey on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) conducted between 2007 and 2008. The sample, comprising 4,279 respondents aged 50 years and above, was analysed using descriptive statistics, cross tabulations and Chi-Square tests, and a multivariable binary logistic regression. Respondents ranged in age from 50 to 114 years, with a median age of 62 years. Stroke prevalence was 2.6%, with the correlates being marital status, level of education, employment status, and living with hypertension or diabetes. The results showed that being separated/divorced, having primary and secondary education, being unemployed and living with hypertension and diabetes, significantly increased the odds of stroke prevalence in this population. The results suggest that interventions to reduce stroke prevalence and impact must be developed alongside interventions for hypertension, diabetes and sociodemographic/economic factors such as marital status, level of education, and employment status."
https://openalex.org/W2922067529,"Elevated plasma concentrations of the uremic toxin asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) and low plasma concentrations of L-homoarginine are independently associated with cardiovascular events and total mortality. Enzymes degrading ADMA [dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1)] and synthesizing L-homoarginine [L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT)] are expressed in human proximal tubule cells. So far, it is not known which transport protein in the basolateral membrane of proximal tubule cells is mediating the uptake of ADMA into the cells for subsequent degradation or the export of intracellularly synthesized L-homoarginine. One study suggested that the uptake transporter OATP4C1 (gene symbol SLCO4C1) may be involved in the transport of ADMA and other uremic toxins. OATP4C1 is a member of the SLCO/SLC21 family of solute carriers, localized in the basolateral membrane of human proximal tubule cells. By using stably-transfected HEK cells overexpressing human OATP4C1, we demonstrate that ADMA and L-homoarginine are substrates of OATP4C1 with Km values of 232.1 μM and 49.9 μM, respectively. ADMA and the structurally related uremic toxin SDMA (100 μM) inhibited OATP4C1-mediated L-homoarginine uptake (P < 0.01), whereas other tested uremic toxins such as urea and p-cresyl sulfate have no effect on OATP4C1-mediated transport. Preloading experiments (300 μM for 60 min) with subsequent efflux studies revealed that OATP4C1 also facilitates efflux e.g. of L-homoarginine. Both ADMA and L-homoarginine are substrates of human OATP4C1. Because proximal tubule cells are one site of ADMA metabolism and L-homoarginine synthesis, we postulate a protective role of OATP4C1 by mediating uptake of ADMA from and export of L-homoarginine into the systemic circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2921765432,"Background Given the gap between patients in need of a renal transplantation (RTx) and organs available, transplantation centers increasingly accept organs of suboptimal quality, e.g. from donors with acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods To determine the outcome of kidney transplants from deceased donors with AKI (defined as ≥ AKIN stage 1), all 107 patients who received a RTx from donors with AKI between August 2004 and July 2014 at our center were compared to their respective consecutively transplanted patients receiving kidneys from donors without AKI. 5-year patient and graft survival, frequencies of delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejections and glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, CKD-EPI) were assessed. Results Patient survival was similar in both groups, whereas death-censored and overall graft survival were decreased in AKI kidney recipients. AKI kidney recipients showed higher frequencies of DGF and had a reduced eGFR at 7 days, three months and one and three years after RTx. However, mortality was noticeably lower compared to waiting list candidates. Rejection-free survival was similar between groups. Conclusions In our cohort, both short-term and long-term renal function was inferior in recipients of AKI kidneys, while patient survival was similar. Our data indicates that recipients of donor AKI kidneys should be carefully selected and additional factors impairing short- and long-term outcome should be minimized to prevent further deterioration of graft function."
https://openalex.org/W2921024589,"Background Enhancing evidence-based practice and improving locally driven research begins with fostering the research skills of undergraduate students in the medical and health sciences. Research as a core component of undergraduate curricula can be facilitated or constrained by various programmatic and institutional factors, including that of choice. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) provides a framework for understanding the influence of choice on student motivation to engage in research. Aim This study aimed to document the enablers and constraints of undergraduate research at a South African Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences (FMHS) and to explore how the presence or absence of choice influenced students’ engagement with research in this context. Methods An exploratory descriptive design was adopted. Undergraduate students who had conducted research and undergraduate programme staff were recruited through purposive sampling. Semi-structured interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed. Findings were interpreted using SDT, focusing on how choice at various levels affects motivation and influences research experiences. Results Many of the programmatic and institutional enablers and constraints–such as time and supervisory availability–were consistent with those previously identified in the literature, regardless of whether research was compulsory or elective. Choice itself seemed to operate as both an enabler and a constraint, highlighting the complexity of choice as an influence on student motivation. SDT provided insight into how programmatic and institutional factors–and in particular choice–supported or suppressed students’ needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, thereby influencing their motivation to engage in research. Conclusion While programmatic and institutional factors may enable or constrain undergraduate research, individual-level factors such as the influence of choice on students’ motivation play a critical role. The implication for curriculum development is that research engagement might be enhanced if levels of choice are structured into the curriculum such that students’ needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are met."
https://openalex.org/W2921127967,"After being the standard plant propagation protocol for decades, cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana sealed with Parafilm remain common today out of practicality, habit, or necessity (as in co-cultures with microorganisms). Regardless of concerns over the aeration of these cultures, no investigation has explored the CO2 transport inside these cultures and its effect on the plants. Thereby, it was impossible to assess whether Parafilm-seals used today or in thousands of older papers in the literature constitute a treatment, and whether this treatment could potentially affect the study of other treatments.For the first time we report the CO2 concentrations in Parafilm-sealed cultures of A. thaliana with a 1 minute temporal resolution, and the transcriptome comparison with aerated cultures. The data show significant CO2 deprivation to the plants, a drastic suppression of photosynthesis, respiration, starch accumulation, chlorophyll biosynthesis, and an increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Most importantly, CO2 deprivation occurs as soon as the cotyledons emerge. Gene expression analysis indicates a significant alteration of 35% of the pathways when compared to aerated cultures, especially in stress response and secondary metabolism processes. On the other hand, the observed increase in the production of glucosinolates and flavonoids suggests intriguing possibilities for CO2 deprivation as an organic biofortification treatment in high-value crops."
https://openalex.org/W2921459324,"Research into sports team performance has shown that across many sports and league competitions, teams that change their coaches after a decline in performance do rebound, but fare no better on average than teams that have not changed their coach in a similar situation. A similar lack of succession benefits has been reported in studies of manager and CEO succession: it has not been established that changing a team’s leader improves a declining team’s performance. We study the effect of a change of coach on the performance of a professional soccer team. Based on rarely obtained access to a whole season (one year) of daily close observation of the team and coaching staff in practice and matches, this study uses quantitative and qualitative data to go beyond the “average” pattern reported in the literature. We document in detail how, in a single team case study over an entire season, the processes in leadership behavior changed with a change of coach, the effect this had on the state of mind of the team, how the match behaviors of the players changed, and how these changes translated into improved performance. The process effects of a leadership change on the performance of a sports team may hold insights for leader succession in management: in addition to the aggregate organizational and experience fit of the new team leader, the specific leadership processes introduced by the new leader are critical for performance effects."
https://openalex.org/W2921691797,"We report a systematic analysis of chloroplast high-molecular mass protein complexes using a combination of native gel electrophoresis and absolute protein quantification by MSE. With this experimental setup, we characterized the effect of the tic56-3 mutation in the 1-MDa inner envelope translocase (TIC) on the assembly of the chloroplast proteome. We show that the tic56-3 mutation results in a reduction of the 1-MDa TIC complex to approximately 10% of wildtype levels. Hierarchical clustering confirmed the association of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) with an envelope-associated FtsH/FtsHi complex and suggested the association of a glycine-rich protein with the 1-MDa TIC complex. Depletion of this complex leads to a reduction of chloroplast ATPase to approx. 75% of wildtype levels, while the abundance of the FtsH/FtsHi complex is increased to approx. 140% of wildtype. The accumulation of the major photosynthetic complexes is not affected by the mutation, suggesting that tic56-3 plants can sustain a functional photosynthetic machinery despite a significant reduction of the 1-MDa TIC complex. Together our analysis expands recent efforts to catalogue the native molecular masses of chloroplast proteins and provides information on the consequences of impaired accumulation of the 1-MDa TIC translocase for chloroplast proteome assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2921741410,"Background Amputation for longstanding therapy resistant complex regional pain syndrome type-I (CRPS-I) is controversial. Reported results are inconsistent. It is assumed that psychological factors play a role in CRPS-I. Objective To explore which psychological factors prior to amputation are associated with poor outcomes after amputation in the case of longstanding therapy resistant CRPS-I. Methods Between May 2008 and August 2015, 31 patients with longstanding therapy resistant CRPS-I were amputated. Before the amputation 11 psychological factors were assessed. In 2016, participants had a structured interview by telephone and filled out questionnaires to assess their outcome. In case of a perceived recurrence of CRPS-I a physician visited the patient to examine the symptoms. Associations between psychological factors and poor outcomes were analysed. Results Four of the 11 psychological factors were associated with poor outcomes. Regression analyses showed that change in the worst pain in the past week was associated with poor social support (B = 0.3, 95% confidence interval: 0.1;0.6) and intensity of pain before amputation (B = 2.0, 95% confidence interval 0.9;3.0). Patients who reported important improvements in mobility (n = 23) had significantly higher baseline resilience (median 79) compared to those (n = 8) who did not report it (median 69)(Mann-Whitney U, Z = -2.398, p = 0.015). Being involved in a lawsuit prior to amputation was associated with a recurrence in the residual limb (Bruehl criteria). A psychiatric history was associated with recurrence somewhere else (Bruehl criteria). Conclusion Poor outcomes of amputation in longstanding therapy resistant CPRS-1 are associated with psychological factors. Outstanding life events are not associated with poor outcome although half of the participants had experienced outstanding life events."
https://openalex.org/W2921764982,"The highest burden of disease from hepatitis C virus (HCV) is found in Southeast Asia, but our understanding of the epidemiology of infection in many heavily burdened countries is still limited. In particular, there is relatively little data on acute HCV infection, the outcome of which can be influenced by both viral and host genetics which differ within the region. We studied HCV genotype and IL28B gene polymorphism in a cohort of acute HCV-infected patients in Southern Vietnam alongside two other cohorts of chronic HCV-infected patients to better understand the epidemiology of HCV infection locally and inform the development of programs for therapy with the increasing availability of directly acting antiviral therapy (DAAs).We analysed plasma samples from patients with acute and chronic HCV infection, including chronic HCV mono-infection and chronic Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-HCV coinfection, who enrolled in four epidemiological or clinical research studies. HCV infection was confirmed with RNA testing. The 5' UTR, core and NSB5 regions of HCV RNA positive samples were sequenced, and the genotype and subtype of the viral strains were determined. Host DNA from all HCV positive patients and age- and sex-matched non-HCV-infected control individuals were analysed for IL28B single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs12979860 and rs8099917). Geolocation of the patients were mapped using QGIS.355 HCV antibody positive patients were analysed; 54.6% (194/355) and 46.4% (161/355) were acute and chronic infections, respectively. 50.4% (81/161) and 49.6.4% (80/161) of chronic infections had HCV mono-infection and HIV-HCV coinfection, respectively. 88.7% (315/355) and 10.1% (36/355) of the patients were from southern and central regions of Vietnam, respectively. 92.4% (328/355) of patients were HCV RNA positive, including 86.1% (167/194) acute and 100% (161/161) chronic infections. Genotype could be determined in 98.4% (322/328) patients. Genotypes 1 (56.5%; 182/322) and 6 (33.9%; 109/322) predominated. Genotype 1 including genotype 1a was significantly higher in HIV-HCV coinfected patients compared to acute HCV patients [43.8% (35/80) versus 20.5% (33/167)], (p = <0.001), while genotype 6 was significantly higher in chronic HCV mono-infected patients [(44.4% (36/81) versus 20.0% (16/80)] (p = < 0.004) compared to HIV-HCV coinfected patients. The prevalence of IL28B SNP (rs12979860) homozygous CC was 86.46% (83/96) in control individuals and was significantly higher in acutely-infected compared to chronically-infected patients [93.2 (82/88) versus 76.1% (35/46)] (p = < 0.005).HCV genotype 6 is highly prevalent in Vietnam and the high prevalence in treatment naïve chronic HCV patients may results from poor spontaneous clearance of acute HCV infection with genotype 6."
https://openalex.org/W2922330317,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas are a common form of highly mutated keratinocyte skin cancers that are of particular concern in immunocompromised patients. Here we report on the efficacy of topically applied MS-275, a clinically used histone deacetylase inhibitor, for the treatment and management of this disease. At 2 mg/kg, MS-275 significantly decreased tumor burden in an SKH-1 hairless mouse model of UVB radiation-induced skin carcinogenesis. MS-275 was cell permeable as a topical formulation and induced histone acetylation changes in mouse tumor tissue. MS-275 was also effective at inhibiting the proliferation of patient derived cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma lines and was particularly potent toward cells isolated from a regional metastasis on an immunocompromised individual. Our findings support the use of alternative routes of administration for histone deacetylase inhibitors in the treatment of high-risk squamous cell carcinoma which may ultimately lead to more precise delivery and reduced systemic toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2952317005,"A growing body of literature has demonstrated the potential for ketamine in the treatment of major depression. Sub-anesthetic doses produce rapid and sustained changes in depressive behavior, both in patients and rodent models, associated with reorganization of glutamatergic synapses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). While ketamine is known to regulate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -type glutamate receptors (NMDARs), the full complement of downstream cellular consequences for ketamine administration are not well understood. Here, we combine electrophysiology with 2-photon imaging and glutamate uncaging in acute slices of mouse PFC to further examine how ketamine alters glutamatergic synaptic transmission. We find that four hours after ketamine treatment, glutamatergic synapses themselves are not significantly affected. However, levels of the neuromodulatory Regulator of G-protein Signaling (RGS4) are dramatically reduced. This loss of RGS4 activity is associated with disruption of the normal compartmentalization of synaptic neuromodulation. Thus, under control conditions, α2 adrenergic receptors and type B γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAB) receptors selectively inhibit α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) -type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) and NMDARs, respectively. After ketamine administration and reduction in RGS4 activity, this selectivity is lost, with both modulatory systems broadly inhibiting glutamatergic transmission. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which ketamine may influence synaptic signaling and provide new avenues for the exploration of therapeutics directed at treating neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression."

In this study we use small flux chambers to examine ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) cycling across the sediment-water interface. Paired restored and unrestored study sites in 5 urban tributaries of the River Thames in Greater London were used to examine N dynamics following physical disturbances (0-3 min exposures) and subsequent biogeochemical activity (3-10 min exposures). Average ambient NH4+ concentrations were significantly different amongst all sites and ranged from 28.0 to 731.7 μg L-1, with the highest concentrations measured at restored sites. Average NO3- concentrations ranged from 9.6 to 26.4 mg L-1, but did not significantly differ between restored and unrestored sites. Average NH4+ fluxes at restored sites ranged from -8.9 to 5.0 μg N m-2 sec-1, however restoration did not significantly influence NH4+ uptake or regeneration (i.e., a measure of release to surface water) between 0-3 minutes and 3-10 minutes. Further, average NO3- fluxes amongst sites responded significantly between 0-3 minutes ranging from -33.6 to 97.7 μg N m-2 sec-1. Neither NH4+ nor NO3- fluxes correlated to sediment chlorophyll-a, total organic matter, or grain size. We attributed variations in overall N fluxes to N-specific sediment storage capacity, biogeochemical transformations, potential legacy effects associated with urban pollution, and variations in river-specific restoration actions."
https://openalex.org/W2922067080,"Baphicacanthus cusia (Nees) Bremek (B. cusia) is an effective herb for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia and psoriasis in traditional Chinese medicine. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is a well-known signaling phytohormone that triggers gene expression in secondary metabolism. Currently, MeJA-mediated biosynthesis of indigo and indirubin in B. cusia is not well understood. In this study, we analyzed the content of indigo and indirubin in leaf and root tissues of B. cusia with high-performance liquid chromatography and measured photosynthetic characteristics of leaves treated by MeJA using FluorCam6 Fluorometer and chlorophyll fluorescence using the portable photosynthesis system CIRAS-2. We performed de novo RNA-seq of B. cusia leaf and root transcriptional profiles to investigate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to exogenous MeJA application. The amount of indigo in MeJA-treated leaves were higher than that in controled leaves (p = 0.004), and the amounts of indigo in treated roots was higher than that in controlled roots (p = 0.048); Chlorophyll fluorescence of leaves treated with MeJA were significantly decreased. Leaves treated with MeJA showed lower photosynthetic rate compared to the control in the absence of MeJA. Functional annotation of DEGs showed the DEGs related to growth and development processes were down-regulated in the treated leaves, while most of the unigenes involved in the defense response were up-regulated in treated roots. This coincided with the effects of MeJA on photosynthetic characteristics and chlorophyll fluorescence. The qRT-PCR results showed that MeJA appears to down-regulate the gene expression of tryptophan synthase β-subunits (trpA-β) in leaves but increased the gene expression of anthranilate synthase (trp 3) in roots responsible for increased indigo content. The results showed that MeJA suppressed leaf photosynthesis for B. cusia and this growth-defense trade-off may contribute to the improved adaptability of B. cusia in changing environments."
https://openalex.org/W2887932455,"There is evidence to suggest that abnormal angiogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis drive diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, there is no specific treatment to counteract these processes. We aimed to determine whether DIAVIT, a natural Vaccinium myrtillus (blueberry) and Hippophae Rhamnoides (sea buckthorn) extract, is protective in a model of type II DN. Diabetic db/db mice were administered DIAVIT in their drinking water for 14 weeks. We assessed the functional, structural, and ultra-structural phenotype of three experimental groups (lean+vehicle, db/db+vehicle, db/db+DIAVIT). We also investigated the angiogenic and fibrotic pathways involved in the mechanism of action of DIAVIT. Diabetic db/db mice developed hyperglycaemia, albuminuria, and an increased glomerular water permeability; the latter two were prevented by DIAVIT. db/db mice developed fibrotic glomeruli, endothelial insult, and glomerular ultra-structural changes, which were not present in DIAVIT-treated mice. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) splicing was altered in the db/db kidney cortex, increasing the pro-angiogenic VEGF-A165 relative to the anti-angiogenic VEGF-A165b. This was partially prevented with DIAVIT treatment. Delphinidin, an anthocyanin abundant in DIAVIT, increased the VEGF-A165b expression relative to total VEGF-A165 in cultured podocytes through phosphorylation of the splice factor SRSF6. DIAVIT, in particular delphinidin, alters VEGF-A splicing in type II DN, rescuing the DN phenotype. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of natural drugs in DN through the manipulation of gene splicing and expression."
https://openalex.org/W2921112288,"Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is an abnormality arising from gastroesophageal reflux disease that can progressively evolve into a sequence of dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. Progression of Barrett’s esophagus into dysplasia is monitored with endoscopic surveillance. The current surveillance standard requests random biopsies plus targeted biopsies of suspicious lesions under white-light endoscopy, known as the Seattle protocol. Recently, published evidence has shown that narrow-band imaging (NBI) can guide targeted biopsies to identify dysplasia and reduce the need for random biopsies. We aimed to assess the health economic implications of adopting NBI-guided targeted biopsy vs. the Seattle protocol from a National Health Service England perspective. A decision tree model was developed to undertake a cost-consequence analysis. The model estimated total costs (i.e. staff and overheads; histopathology; adverse events; capital equipment) and clinical implications of monitoring a cohort of patients with known/suspected BE, on an annual basis. In the simulation, BE patients (N = 161,657 at Year 1; estimated annual increase: +20%) entered the model every year and underwent esophageal endoscopy. After 7 years, the adoption of NBI with targeted biopsies resulted in cost reduction of £458.0 mln vs. HD-WLE with random biopsies (overall costs: £1,966.2 mln and £2,424.2 mln, respectively). The incremental investment on capital equipment to upgrade hospitals with NBI (+£68.3 mln) was offset by savings due to the reduction of histological examinations (-£505.2 mln). Reduction of biopsies also determined savings for avoided adverse events (-£21.1 mln). In the base-case analysis, the two techniques had the same accuracy (number of correctly identified cases: 1.934 mln), but NBI was safer than HD-WLE. Budget impact analysis and cost-effectiveness analyses confirmed the findings of the cost-consequence analysis. In conclusion, NBI-guided targeted biopsies was a cost-saving strategy for NHS England, compared to current practice for detection of dysplasia in patients with BE, whilst maintaining at least comparable health outcomes for patients."
https://openalex.org/W2922142946,"Eukaryotic DNA binding proteins must access genomic DNA that is packaged into chromatin in vivo. During a productive infection, retroviral integrases (IN) must similarly interact with chromatin to integrate the viral cDNA genome. Here we examine the role of nucleosome DNA unwrapping in the retroviral integrase search for a target site. These studies utilized PFV intasomes that are comprised of a tetramer of PFV IN with two oligomers mimicking the viral cDNA ends. Modified recombinant human histones were used to generate nucleosomes with increased unwrapping rates at different DNA regions. These modifications included the acetylmimetic H3(K56Q) and the chemically engineered H4(K77ac, K79ac). While transcription factors and DNA damage sensors may search nucleosome bound DNA during transient unwrapping, PFV intasome mediated integration appears to be unaffected by increased nucleosome unwrapping. These studies suggest PFV intasomes do not utilize nucleosome unwrapping to search nucleosome targets."

In this study, we investigated CD4+CD8α+ dp T cells in secondary lymphatic organs (i.e. mesenteric and tracheobronchial lymph nodes, spleen, Peyer’s patches) and non-lymphatic tissues (i.e. lung and epithelium of the small intestine) within a homogeneous group of healthy Beagle dogs by multi-color flow cytometry. The aim of this systematic analysis was to identify the tissue-specific localization and characteristics of this distinct T cell subpopulation. Our results revealed a mature extrathymic CD1a-CD4+CD8α+ dp T cell population in all analyzed organs, with highest frequencies within Peyer’s patches. Constitutive expression of the activation marker CD25 is a feature of many CD4+CD8α+ dp T cells independent of their localization and points to an effector phenotype. A proportion of lymph node CD4+CD8α+ dp T cells is FoxP3+ indicating regulatory potential. Within the intestinal environment, the cytotoxic marker granzyme B is expressed by CD4+CD8α+ dp intraepithelial lymphocytes. In addition, a fraction of CD4+CD8α+ dp intraepithelial lymphocytes and of mesenteric lymph node CD4+CD8α+ dp T cells is TCRγδ+. However, the main T cell receptor of all tissue-associated CD4+CD8α+ dp T cells could be identified as TCRαβ. Interestingly, the majority of the CD4+CD8α+ dp T cell subpopulation expresses the unconventional CD8αα homodimer, in contrast to CD8α+ sp T cells, and CD4+CD8α+ dp thymocytes which are mainly CD8αβ+. The presented data provide the basis for a functional analysis of tissue-specific CD4+CD8α+ dp T cells to elucidate their role in health and disease of dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2922031899,"The wording negotiators use shapes the emotions of their counterparts. These emotions, in turn, influence their counterparts' economic decisions. Building on this rationale, we examined how the language used during negotiation affects discount rate and willingness to engage in future deals. In three studies, participants assumed the role of retailers. Alleged counterparts (actually a computerized program) asked for a discount under three conditions: request, want, and demand. Results show that less extreme language (request/want) resulted in better outcomes than demanding a discount. Moreover, while the language used by the customer had an effect on experienced emotions, the positive emotions (sympathy and empathy) participants felt toward the customer mediated the relationship between the linguistic cue and the negotiation outcome. Our results inform both psycholinguistic research and negotiation research by demonstrating the causal role of linguistic cues in activating concept-knowledge relevant to different emotional experiences, and point to the down-the-line impact on shaping negotiation preferences."

However, there is a perception that scientific information about the health impact of radiation exposure has not been adequately shared among the local government staffs, including schoolteachers. We contacted schoolteachers at all 120 schools within the Urgent Protective Action Planning Zone of the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant, Kagoshima prefecture, in 2017. We invited them to take part in a written survey to clarify their concerns and risk perceptions regarding the effects of radiation exposure on health. Five hundred and fifty schoolteachers' replies were included in the analysis. The results revealed that 355 schoolteachers had concerns about the health effects of radiation exposure due to working within the Urgent Protective Action Planning Zone. A logistic regression analysis revealed that sex (OR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.49-3.45, p < 0.001), age (OR = 3.39, 95% CI: 2.10-5.47, p < 0.001), reluctance to undergo a radiological examination at a hospital (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.23-2.88, p = 0.004), place of work (OR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.46-3.27, p < 0.001), and anxiety about having to address questions about radiation from students (OR = 4.66, 95% CI: 2.83-7.67, p < 0.001) were independently associated with schoolteachers' concerns about the health effects of radiation exposure due to working in the area around the nuclear power plant. Therefore, it is important to respond to these concerns in order to establish a meaningful education program for school children on radiation and its health effects."
https://openalex.org/W2922498000,"The obligate mutualism and exquisite specificity of many plant-pollinator interactions lead to the expectation that flower phenotypes (e.g., corolla tube length) and corresponding pollinator traits (e.g., hawkmoth proboscis length) are congruent as a result of coevolution by natural selection. However, the effect of variation in flower morphology on the fitness of plants and their pollinators has not been quantified systematically. In this study, we employed the theoretical morphospace paradigm using a combination of 3D printing, electronic sensing, and machine vision technologies to determine the influence of two flower morphological features (corolla curvature and nectary diameter) on the fitness of both parties: the artificial flower and its hawkmoth pollinator. Contrary to the expectation that the same flower morphology maximizes the fitness of both plant and pollinator, we found that the two parties have divergent optima for corolla curvature, with non-overlapping fitness peaks in flower morphospace. The divergent fitness optima between plants and pollinators could lead to evolutionary diversification in both groups."
https://openalex.org/W2921068344,"Tobacco use and oral sex (OS) are important risk factors for oral and oropharyngeal Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Little is known about the prevalence of OS practice in South Africa. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of OS practice and tobacco use in a South African patient population. This cross-sectional study used a structured questionnaire to collect socio-demographic characteristics, tobacco use, betel nut use and OS practice data from consenting adults (≥18 years; n = 850). Oral sex practices were recorded for patients 18-45 years-old (n = 514). Data analysis included chi-square and multiple logistic regression analyses. Of the study population, 55.2% (n = 468) were female, 88% (n = 748) self-identified as black Africans and 45.1% (n = 383) were unemployed. Furthermore, 19.7% (n = 167), 6.4% (n = 54) and 2.1% (n = 18) were current smokers, snuff users and betel nut users, respectively. Out of the 514 who answered the questionnaire in relation to OS, 22.8% (n = 115) reported to practice it. Oral sex practice in the age group 18-45 years was most common among the self-identified white participants (41.9%); and among tobacco users than among non-tobacco users (30.9% vs. 20.5%; p = 0.022). A multivariable-adjusted regression model showed that white South Africans were more likely to use tobacco than black Africans (OR = 5.25; 95% CI = 2.21-12.47). The practice of OS was more likely among those 18-35 years-old (OR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.01-2.74), but had no significant association with tobacco use (OR = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.62-1.83). The observed age and ethnic differences in both risk behaviours suggest a need for targeted population intervention in order to reduce the risk for oral HPV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2921468144,"African American men are disproportionately affected by, not only HIV/AIDS, but also chronic non-communicable diseases. Despite the known benefits of physical activity for reducing chronic non-communicable diseases, scant research has identified factors that may influence physical activity in this population. A growing literature centers on the syndemic theory, the notion that multiple adverse conditions interact synergistically, contributing to excess morbidity. This secondary data analysis examined two primary questions: whether syndemic conditions prospectively predicted physical activity, and whether, consistent with the syndemic theory, syndemic conditions interacted to predict physical activity. Participants were 595 African American men who have sex with men (MSM), a population underrepresented in health research, enrolled in a health-promotion intervention trial from 2008-2011. We used generalized-estimating-equations models to test the associations of syndemic conditions and resilience factors measured pre-intervention to self-reported physical activity 6 and 12 months post-intervention. As hypothesized, reporting more syndemic conditions pre-intervention predicted reporting less physical activity 6 and 12 months post-intervention, adjusting for the intervention. However, contrary to the syndemic theory, we did not find evidence for the interaction effects of syndemic conditions in predicting physical activity. Receiving high school education and having greater social network diversity predicted more physical activity whereas older age predicted less physical activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the syndemic theory in relation to physical activity. Although reporting a greater number of syndemic conditions was related to reduced physical activity, there was no evidence for synergy among syndemic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2921506513,"The Cre-mediated genetic switch combines the ability of Cre recombinase to stably invert or excise a DNA fragment depending upon the orientation of flanking mutant loxP sites. In this work, we have tested this strategy in vivo with the aim to generate two conditional knock-in mice for missense mutations in the Impad1 and Clcn7 genes causing two different skeletal dysplasias. Targeting constructs were generated in which the Impad1 exon 2 and an inverted exon 2* and the Clcn7 exon 7 and an inverted exon 7* containing the point mutations were flanked by mutant loxP sites in a head-to-head orientation. When the Cre recombinase is present, the DNA flanked by the mutant loxP sites is expected to be stably inverted leading to the activation of the mutated exon. The targeting vectors were used to generate heterozygous floxed mice in which inversion of the wild-type with the mutant exon has not occurred yet. To generate knock-in mice, floxed animals were mated to a global Cre-deleter mouse strain for stable inversion and activation of the mutation. Unexpectedly the phenotype of homozygous Impad1 knock-in animals overlaps with the lethal phenotype described previously in Impad1 knock-out mice. Similarly, the phenotype of homozygous Clcn7 floxed mice overlaps with Clcn7 knock-out mice. Expression studies by qPCR and RT-PCR demonstrated that mutant mRNA underwent abnormal splicing leading to the synthesis of non-functional proteins. Thus, the skeletal phenotypes in both murine strains were not caused by the missense mutations, but by aberrant splicing. Our data demonstrate that the Cre mediated genetic switch strategy should be considered cautiously for the generation of conditional knock-in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2921381235,"Mexican tropical dry forests are remarkably extensive and floristically diverse despite manifesting alarming rates of deforestation. Riparian habitats within dry forests provide critical ecological benefits that may mitigate negative impacts, but processes underlying riparian functions are still not well understood. We identified physical environmental conditions affecting the composition and abundance of standing vegetation assemblages and woody and herbaceous components in soil seedbank assemblages of riparian corridors in central Mexico using mainly NMDS ordination techniques, permuted analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), permuted analysis of multivariate dispersions and constrained ordination (CAP). We then determined representative species associated with particular environmental conditions using an indicator species analysis and assessed the effects of physical environmental variables/factors on total seed abundances by fitting a mixed-effect model. For the standing vegetation study, we assessed the effects of the type of the river condition (differing in surface flow permanence), location, and height above river level on the community composition based on three species importance criteria (abundance, coverage and DBH). For the soil seedbank study, we assessed the effects of these variables/factors plus season and land use. Spatial heterogeneity was a prevailing feature in riparian vegetation, in the standing vegetation and soil seedbank of both woody and herbaceous components. Height above river level had a significant effect on the three species importance criteria of standing vegetation and so did the interaction between surface flow permanence and height on coverage. The soil seedbank of woody and herbaceous plants showed significant differences between seasons; Taxodium mucronatum was an indicator tree species in dry seasons. Land use, height, surface flow permanence and the interaction between land use and surface flow permanence had significant effects on the soil seedbank of herbaceous plants. Total seed abundances in the soil varied between years and were higher at lower height values, during the dry seasons, and when rivers were permanent. Tree communities, commonly the most important elements in riparian ecosystems, were preserved in the soil seedbank of cultivated areas for >30 years. Seeds of herbaceous communities were predominant and ecologically relevant as indicator species because of their high sensitivity to several key environmental factors, constituting a critical component of Mexican tropical dry forests riparian corridors."
https://openalex.org/W2921746839,"Soil is the medium that balances the soil and water pressure on the excavation surface of an earth pressure balance (EPB) shield machine, and the soil flow plasticity directly affects the working performance of the shield machine. The spiral shear stress is the main determinant of the soil flow plasticity. During the progress of the EPB shield screw conveyor normal operation, the shear effects between the muck in the spiral tube and the screw shaft, as well as the flight, are different from the shear action, such as the direct shear or the vane shear. The direct or vane shear test is now widely used to evaluate soil flow plasticity. To better investigate the shear properties between the soil and the shield conveyor casing, a model screw conveyor was developed. Based on the analysis of the stress conditions and the movement of the conditioned soil plug, the theoretical calculation model of the equivalent helical shear stress of the EPB shield screw conveyor was deduced based on the steady-state equilibrium conditions of moment of momentum. The conditioned standard sand was used in the indoor tests. The results of the indoor test of the model machine verified the rationality and effectiveness of the theoretical model. The model provides an important theoretical basis and references for the design and optimization of soil conditioning during shield tunneling."
https://openalex.org/W2921809012,"Based on the Markowitz mean variance model, this paper discusses the portfolio selection problem in an uncertain environment. To construct a more realistic and optimized model, in this paper, a new general interval quadratic programming model for portfolio selection is established by introducing the linear transaction costs and liquidity of the securities market. Regarding the estimation for the new model, we propose an effective numerical solution method based on the Lagrange theorem and duality theory, which can obtain the effective upper and lower bounds of the objective function of the model. In addition, the proposed method is illustrated with two examples, and the results show that the proposed method is better and more feasible than the commonly used portfolio selection method."
https://openalex.org/W2921841278,"Self-rated health (SRH) is a subjective health measurement that predicts mortality and morbidity and reflects mental health and socioeconomic status. Since a couple's relationship can influence the health status of the individuals involved, poor family communication can negatively influence the health status of its members. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting SRH among married couples in primary care and evaluated the effect of family communication on SRH.In this cross-sectional analysis of Family Cohort Study in Primary Care, 469 couples (938 participants) were analyzed to evaluate the relationship between SRH and family communication. Participants answered questionnaires on demographic characteristics and lifestyle factors. The Korean version of the Family Communication Scale of Family Adaptation and Cohesion Evaluation Scale-IV was used to assess family communication, and a 5-point scale of SRH questions was used to assess the SRH status. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed in order to evaluate the relationship between family communication and SRH and identify associated factors for good SRH.Wives with a high family communication level had higher OR for good SRH. When the husband and wife both reported high family communication levels, the OR for good SRH increased in wives; however, the relationship between family communication and SRH was not significant in husbands. In the multi-adjusted model, the OR for good SRH of husbands increased in those with >12 years of education, moderate drinkers and decreased in current smokers. The OR for good SRH of wives increased in those with age of 60 to 69, those with >12 years of education, and those who participated in vigorous physical activity, and decreased in those with diabetes and depressive mood.Our results indicate that improvement in family communication may contribute to better SRH."
https://openalex.org/W2922390544,"It is imperative to address the health problems faced by immigrants in their destination countries in light of the current magnitude of migration processes worldwide. We aimed to evaluate the socioeconomic determinants of healthcare utilization in immigrants with depression.A population-based cohort comprising all immigrants who were eligible for National Health Insurance coverage (permanent residents, marriage immigrants, and naturalized citizens) using the National Health Insurance Claims Database in 2011-2013 was established. Cases were defined as immigrants with new-onset depression. Controls were new-onset Korean patients with depression matched by age, sex, and Charlson comorbidity index in a 1:2 ratio. Appropriateness of care (AOC) was defined as visiting a clinic for depression management at least 3 times in the first 12 weeks and 4 times thereafter until 12 months post-cohort entry.A total of 2,378 immigrants and 4,756 matched Korean patients were identified. Of the immigrants, 30.0% achieved AOC, in contrast to 38.7% of Koreans (p < .0001). Adjusting for possible covariates, AOC was less likely for immigrants (adjusted OR (aOR), 0.760; 95% CI: 0.670-0.863). Medical Aid (aOR, 2.309; 95% CI, 1.479-3.610), rural residence (aOR, 1.536; 95% CI, 1.054-2.237), the presence of a psychiatric comorbidity (aOR, 1.912; 95% CI, 1.484-2.463), and visiting a psychiatrist (aOR, 2.387; 95% CI, 1.821-3.125) were associated with an increased likelihood of AOC in immigrants.Socioeconomic determinants included insurance type (Medical Aid and National Health Insurance), place of residence, psychiatric comorbid status, doctor specialty, easy access to medical services (clinic-based), and a SSRI-based treatment regimen. Those predictors should be taken into account when developing healthcare strategies for immigrants."
