While the lack of sterol synthesis seems to be a metabolic defect common to all insects, the requirements for specific sterols vary widely among insect species. Cholesterol has been generally used as the dietary supplement and it supports growth and development equally well in all the insects examined. However most insects can be reared on sterols other than cholesterol as long as the sterols contain a fl-hydroxyl group at C-3 in the normal steroid ring system and a hydrocarbon side chain. Substituents at C-24 (as in plant and fungal sterols), double bonds in the side chain (stigmasterol and ergosterol), or even the lack of a nuclear double bond (cholestanol and tetrahydrostigmasterol) do not abolish biological activity, though they render the sterols less active in some cases. This generalization, however, holds only for insects which are omnivorous, herbivorous, or feed on plant products. For carnivorous insects such as the hide beetle D. vulpinus and the related Attugenus piceus only cholesterol and the closely similar ‘I-dehydrocholesterol and 24-dehydrocholesterol are satisfactory sterol sources. The results cited are the contribu- tions of many investigators and are summarized in several recent review articles (2-4). The objective of the present study was to ascertain whether the requirement for a cholesterol-type sterol by Dermestes is absolute. To this end various sterols which do not support the growth of Dermestes by themselves were tested for cholesterol- sparing activity. Underlying this approach was the hypothesis that the function of sterols in insects is 2-fold: (a) to provide the precursors for one or more metabolites which are themselves physiologically active (metabolic role), and (b) to serve as an essential cellular component without undergoing any metabolic alterations (structural role). Cholesterol, according to this hypothesis, can perform both of these functions. On the other hand, sterols capable of only partially replacing cholesterol for Dermestes might be able to perform one of these essential func- tions and thereby spare cholesterol. To test this possibility was the purpose of the experiments to be described. Support for the hypothesis of a dual function will be presented and it will * Supported by grants-in-aid from the United States Public Health Service, and Life Insurance Medical Research Fund, the National Science Foundation, and the Eugene Higgins Trust Fund of Harvard University.

The metabolic role of cholesterol in was further examined by testing various steroids, known to be physiologically active in higher animals, for their ability to replace or spare cholesterol."

https://openalex.org/W195820083,"The incorporation of labeled precursors into ribonucleic acid with cell-free preparations of animal tissues has been observed in a number of laboratories (l-lo). Further studies with partially purified preparations indicate that the proximate precursors are nucleoside trirather than diphosphates (24). These enzyme preparations, unlike deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase (11-13) or polynucleotide phosphorylase (14)) incorporate adenine nucleotide into RNA almost exclusively at the terminal position of the polyribonucleotide chain adjacent to a cytosine monophosphate residue (2). The final product, adenosineCMP-CMP-RNA is the amino acid acceptor required for the transfer of aminoacyl residues to the site of their ultimate incorporation into proteins (15-18). Edmonds and Abrams (3), however, have provided some evidence for a separate enzyme, responsible for the incorporation of the adenine nucleotide moiety of ATP into internucleotide linkages in RNA. Herbert (10) has reported that this type of reaction is enhanced if cytoplasmic enzyme preparations are supplemented by nuclei.’ In the course of studies on the possible occurrence of polynucleotide phosphorylase in extracts of tissues of chick embryos, we investigated the exchange of labeled inorganic phosphate and pyrophosphate with ribonucleoside diand triphosphates. Although the rate of incorporation of phosphate into ribonucleoside diphosphates was rather low, that of inorganic pyrophosphate into ribonucleoside triphosphates appeared relatively high and independent of the presence of amino acids, but dependent on the presence of polynucleotide (19-21). The present communication examines the reactions involved in more detail. When the soluble fraction of homogenates of 14-day-old chick embryonic livers or hearts was purified by means of ammonium sulfate and calcium phosphate gel, an enzyme preparation was obtained which catalyzed the incorporation of the AMP moiety of ATP into RNA. The incorporated adenine nucleotide was found almost entirely at the terminal position of the polynucleotide chain. The reaction did not take place when ADP was substituted for ATP. The incorporation of adenine nucleotide into the interior of the polynucleotide chain could be shown to take place in the presence of a cruder enzyme preparation. This system required ATP as a substrate and was dependent on the presence of Mg++. Addi-"

https://openalex.org/W2025396697,"The theory of the weak visible radiation produced in a solvent by the action of gamma rays is discussed. It is shown why this phenomenon cannot be interpreted as luminescence. The radiation exhibited a property of extremely pronounced spatial asymmetry which lead to the theory that the radiation is produced by electrons which move uniformly in the substance with a velocity which exceeds the phase velocity of light in this medium. Angular distributions of the radiation intensity were determined for four liquids. The value of the angle was found to increase with increase in the index of refraction of the solvent. The measurement oi the intensity of the radiation by the proper electronic circuit is discussed. Applications of the radiation in particle detectors, in the study of broad cosmic showers, and in the measurement of energy are discussed. (C.J.G.)"

Metanephrine is as potent as epinephrine on rabbit aortic strips. The same compounds demonstrate a lesser potency on rabbit duodenum preparation, while 3-methoxy-dopamine produces a slight contraction of the duodenum. Both metanephrine and 3-methoxy-dopamine have 15 to 25 percent of the pressor activity of the original nonmethylated catecholamines. Normetanephrine is 1/600 as active as norepinephrine on the blood pressure of the cat."

https://openalex.org/W2055246488,"SINCE Hirsch's1 theory of the Golgi presubstance, according to which there exist homogeneous granular mass as a precursor of the ‘Golgi’ system, there has been very little attempt to investigate the origin of these inclusions in the cell. Nath and Chopra2 reported the origin of ‘Golgi dictyosomes’ from mitochondria in the spermatocytes of the slug, Anadenus altivagus. However, such a conclusion was arrived at on the basis of morphological study inasmuch as the ‘Golgi dictyosomes’ disappear at the metaphase and anaphase stages of meiosis I and II, probably merging into the mitochondria ; they again appear in the respective telophase stages by the alignment of lipid granules, which seemed to take their origin from the mitochondria. These observations were later confirmed by Nath and Gupta3 in the living spermatocytes of Anadenus and Euaustenia under phase-contrast microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2061675890,IT is known that adrenalin inhibits milk ejection1. In an attempt to determine whether this inhibition is central or peripheral a series of experiments were performed on rats. The effect of prior administration of ergotamine on the adrenalin-induced black was studied. In the course of this investigation it appeared that ergotamine and ergometrine also had a milk-ejecting action of their own. This property of ergot causing milk ejection does not appear to have been described before.
