https://openalex.org/W2085767196,"The physical linkage between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton of a cell is made by structures known as focal adhesions, acting through integrin receptors. They are of fundamental importance in human physiology because they mediate cell adhesion, mechanosensing and signalling for the control of cell growth and differentiation. The molecular architecture of focal adhesions has now been determined using three-dimensional super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to map protein organization at the nanoscale level. They are revealed as well-organized ultrastructures in which integrins and actin are separated by a 40-nanometre-long core consisting of partially overlapping protein-specific layers, spanned by talin tethers. The multilaminar architecture creates three or more separate compartments that mediate the interdependent functions of focal adhesions. Focal adhesions link the extracellular matrix by integrin receptors to cytoplasmic actin filaments and are fundamental to human physiology. These authors determine the molecular architecture of focal adhesions by mapping protein organization at the nanoscale level. The results demonstrate that focal adhesions possess a well-organized ultrastructure made up of at least three spatial and functional compartments that mediate their interdependent functions. Cell adhesions to the extracellular matrix (ECM) are necessary for morphogenesis, immunity and wound healing1,2. Focal adhesions are multifunctional organelles that mediate cell–ECM adhesion, force transmission, cytoskeletal regulation and signalling1,2,3. Focal adhesions consist of a complex network4 of trans-plasma-membrane integrins and cytoplasmic proteins that form a <200-nm plaque5,6 linking the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton. The complexity of focal adhesion composition and dynamics implicate an intricate molecular machine7,8. However, focal adhesion molecular architecture remains unknown. Here we used three-dimensional super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (interferometric photoactivated localization microscopy)9 to map nanoscale protein organization in focal adhesions. Our results reveal that integrins and actin are vertically separated by a ∼40-nm focal adhesion core region consisting of multiple protein-specific strata: a membrane-apposed integrin signalling layer containing integrin cytoplasmic tails, focal adhesion kinase and paxillin; an intermediate force-transduction layer containing talin and vinculin; and an uppermost actin-regulatory layer containing zyxin, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and α-actinin. By localizing amino- and carboxy-terminally tagged talins, we reveal talin’s polarized orientation, indicative of a role in organizing the focal adhesion strata. The composite multilaminar protein architecture provides a molecular blueprint for understanding focal adhesion functions."

Currently, though, the primary hurdle for incorporating plant-derived material into existing process feeds is the high proportion of oxygen in its molecular frameworks. Rapid heating of the biomass followed by high-temperature treatment with zeolite catalysts can yield tractable quantities of useful commodity compounds such as ethylene and benzene, but much of the carbon is wasted in the process—diverted either toward gaseous CO and CO 2 , or solid coke. Vispute et al. (p. 1222 ) show that an intermediate step, in which hydrogen is catalytically incorporated into the heated material prior to zeolite treatment, can substantially raise the yield of useful products by reducing susceptibility to coking."

The current study tested the effectiveness of a psychological intervention, called values affirmation, in reducing the gender achievement gap in a college-level introductory physics class. In this randomized double-blind study, 399 students either wrote about their most important values or not, twice at the beginning of the 15-week course. Values affirmation reduced the male-female performance and learning difference substantially and elevated women's modal grades from the C to B range. Benefits were strongest for women who tended to endorse the stereotype that men do better than women in physics. A brief psychological intervention may be a promising way to address the gender gap in science performance and learning."

Glycans, sequences of carbohydrates conjugated to proteins and lipids, are arguably the most abundant and structurally diverse class of molecules in nature. Recent advances in glycomics reveal the scope and scale of their functional roles and their impact on human disease. Cells run on carbohydrates. Glycans, sequences of carbohydrates conjugated to proteins and lipids, are arguably the most abundant and structurally diverse class of molecules in nature. Recent advances in glycomics reveal the scope and scale of their functional roles and their impact on human disease. By analogy to the genome, transcriptome, or proteome, the “glycome” is the complete set of glycans and glycoconjugates that are made by a cell or organism under specific conditions. Therefore, “glycomics” refers to studies that attempt to define or quantify the glycome of a cell, tissue, or organism (Bertozzi and Sasisekharan, 2009Bertozzi C.R. Sasisekharan R. Glycomics.in: Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Stanley P. Bertozzi C.R. Hart G.W. Etzler M.E. Essentials of Glycobiology. Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, protein glycosylation generally involves the covalent attachment of glycans to serine, threonine, or asparagine residues. Glycoproteins occur in all cellular compartments. Glycans are also attached to lipids, often ceramide, which is comprised of sphingosine, a hydrocarbon amino alcohol and a fatty acid. Complex glycans are mainly attached to secreted or cell surface proteins, and they do not cycle on and off of the polypeptide. In contrast, the monosaccharide O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) cycles rapidly on serine or threonine residues of many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Identifying the number, structure, and function of glycans in cellular biology is a daunting task but one that has been made easier in recent years by advances in technology and by our growing appreciation of how integral glycans are to biology (Varki et al., 2009Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Stanley P. Bertozzi C.R. Hart G.W. Etzler M.E. Essentials of Glycobiology.Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009Google Scholar). The scope of the glycomics challenge is immense. The covalent addition of glycans to proteins and lipids represents not only the most abundant posttranslational modification (PTM), but also by far the most structurally diverse. Although it is commonly stated that more than 50% of all polypeptides are covalently modified by glycans (Apweiler et al., 1999Apweiler R. Hermjakob H. Sharon N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar), even this estimate is far too low because it fails to include that myriad nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins are modified by O-GlcNAc (Hart et al., 2007Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Even though the generic term “glycosylation” is often used to categorize and lump all glycan modifications of proteins into one bin, side by side with other posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, or methylation, such a view is not only inaccurate, but also is completely misleading. If one only considers the linkage of the first glycan to the polypeptide in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, there are at least 13 different monosaccharides and 8 different amino acids involved in glycoprotein linkages, with a total of at least 41 different chemical bonds known to be linking the glycan to the protein (Spiro, 2002Spiro R.G. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 43R-56RCrossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Importantly, each one of these unique glycan:protein linkages is surely as different in both structure and function as protein methylation is from acetylation. Of course, this modification is not only about a single linkage. When structural diversity of the additional oligosaccharide branches of glycans and the added diversity of complex terminal saccharides on glycans, such as fucose or sialic acids (about 50 different sialic acids are known [Schauer, 2009Schauer R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar]), are taken into account, the molecular diversity and varied functions of protein-bound glycans rapidly increase exponentially. Just the “sialome” (Cohen and Varki, 2010Cohen M. Varki A. OMICS. 2010; 14: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) rivals or exceeds many other posttranslational modifications in abundance and structural/functional diversity. In addition, chemical modifications, such as phosphorylation, sulfation, and acetylation, increase the glycan structural/functional diversity even more. Thus, categorizing glycosylation as a single type of posttranslational modification is neither useful nor at all reflective of reality. Glycoconjugates provide dynamic structural diversity to proteins and lipids that is responsive to cellular phenotype, to metabolic state, and to the developmental stage of cells. Complex glycans play critical roles in intercellular and intracellular processes, which are fundamentally important to the development of multicellularity (Figure 1). Unlike nucleic acids and proteins, glycan structures are not hardwired into the genome, depending upon a template for their synthesis. Rather, the glycan structures that end up on a polypeptide or lipid result from the concerted actions of highly specific glycosyltransferases (Lairson et al., 2008Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), which in turn are dependent upon the concentrations and localization of high-energy nucleotide sugar donors, such as UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, the endpoint of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, the glycoforms of a glycoprotein depend upon many factors directly tied to both gene expression and cellular metabolism. There are at-least 250 glycosyltransferases in the human genome, and it has been estimated that about 2% of the human genome encodes proteins involved in glycan biosynthesis, degradation, or transport (Schachter and Freeze, 2009Schachter H. Freeze H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of the nucleotide sugar donors is directly regulated by nucleic acid, glucose, and energy metabolism, and the compartmentalization of these nucleotide sugar donors is highly regulated by specific transporters. Protein glycosylation is therefore controlled by rates of polypeptide translation and protein folding, localization of and competition between glycosyltransferases, cellular concentration and localization of nucleotide sugars, the localization of glycosidases, and membrane trafficking. Thus, individual glycosylation sites on the same polypeptide can contain different glycan structures that reflect both the type and status of the cell in which they are synthesized. For example, the glycoforms of the membrane protein Thy-1 are very different in lymphocytes than they are in brain, despite having the same polypeptide sequence (Rudd and Dwek, 1997Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 1-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Conversely, even small changes in polypeptide sequence or structure will alter the types of glycan structures attached to a polypeptide. For example, histocompatibility antigen polypeptides with more than 90% sequence homology contain different N-linked glycan profiles at individual sites, reflective of their allelic type, even when they are synthesized within the same cells (Swiedler et al., 1985Swiedler S.J. Freed J.H. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4046-4054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, site-specific protein glycosylation is highly regulated by gene expression of glycan-processing enzymes, by polypeptide structure at all levels, and by cellular metabolism. A detailed understanding of cellular processes will require a detailed appreciation of the glycans modulating proteins and pathways. Although this ultimate goal of glycomics is laudable, we are a very long way from having the technology to completely characterize the glycome of even a simple cell or tissue. Not only is the glycome much more complex than the genome, transcriptome, or proteome, as noted above, it is also much more dynamic, varying considerably not only with cell type, but also with the developmental stage and metabolic state of a cell. Even very conservative estimates indicate that there are well over a million different glycan structures in a mammalian cell's glycome. However, upon considering “functional glycomics,” it is estimated that the binding sites of glycan-binding proteins (GBPs), such as antibodies, lectins, receptors, toxins, microbial adhesions, or enzymes (Figure 1), can accommodate only up to two to six monosaccharides within a glycan structure (Cummings, 2009Cummings R.D. Mol. Biosyst. 2009; 5: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Therefore, the number of specific glycan substructures that bind to biologically important GBPs in a cell may be fewer than 10,000, a number that is within the realm of current analytical and, if targeted, chemical or enzymatic synthetic capabilities. Until recently, the lack of tools and the inherent complexity of glycans have been major barriers preventing most biologists from embracing the importance of glycans in biology. Recent technological advances have significantly lowered these barriers. Indeed, the tools of glycomics and the subfields of glycoproteomics, glycolipidomics, and proteoglycomics have all progressed substantially in recent years (Krishnamoorthy and Mahal, 2009Krishnamoorthy L. Mahal L.K. ACS Chem. Biol. 2009; 4: 715-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, Laremore et al., 2010Laremore T.N. Leach III, F.E. Solakyildirim K. Amster I.J. Linhardt R.J. Methods Enzymol. 2010; 478: 79-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Major technological advances, many of which are shared with proteomics, have recently allowed semiquantitative profiling of glycans and glycoproteins (Krishnamoorthy and Mahal, 2009Krishnamoorthy L. Mahal L.K. ACS Chem. Biol. 2009; 4: 715-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, Vanderschaeghe et al., 2010Vanderschaeghe D. Festjens N. Delanghe J. Callewaert N. Biol. Chem. 2010; 391: 149-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these advances are the result of the National Institute of General Medical Science's (NIGMS) support of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG), which has served to focus and assist more than 500 researchers on issues related to glycomics (Paulson et al., 2006Paulson J.C. Blixt O. Collins B.E. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, Raman et al., 2006Raman R. Venkataraman M. Ramakrishnan S. Lang W. Raguram S. Sasisekharan R. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 82R-90RCrossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Kobata and colleagues were among the first to profile N-glycans, well before the current concepts of glycomics were conceived. Despite the lack of many modern methods, their pioneering work was characterized by a high level of rigor in defining the arrays of N-glycan structures present in cells and tissues and on specific proteins (Endo, 2010Endo T. J. Biochem. 2010; 147: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Currently, a wide variety of high-resolution and highly sensitive methods are available, including capillary electrophoresis (CE), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and lectin microarrays. Glycans are often profiled after their release from polypeptides, which results in the loss of any information about proteins and sites to which they were attached. Even though it is much more difficult, it is also much preferable to perform glycopeptide profiling (glycoproteomics) to first identify attachment sites prior to detailed profiling or structural analysis of the glycans present on a polypeptide. The ultimate goal of glycoproteomics, which is to define all of the molecular species (glycoforms) of glycoproteins in a cell or tissue, has not yet been realized for any glycoprotein with more than one glycan attachment site. N-glycans are generally released from proteins by peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), which cleaves most, but not all, N-glycans. Unfortunately, no such broadly specific enzyme exists for O-glycans, which are generally released by chemical methods, such as alkali-induced β elimination, or by hydrazinolysis. However, for relatively pure glycoproteins, so called “top-down” mass spectrometric methods, which do not involve prior release of the glycans, may eventually prove useful, as instrumentation and methods improve (Reid et al., 2002Reid G.E. Stephenson Jr., J.L. McLuckey S.A. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Due to the small sample sizes involved, most CE or HPLC separation methods require chemical modification of released glycans with fluorescent compounds. CE and HPLC methods provide high-resolution separation of glycans, and when combined with laser-induced fluorescent detection (LIF), tagged glycans can be detected in the low femtomole range. High pH anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed-amperometric detection separates glycans with high resolution and detects them with high sensitivity without chemical modification, but the high alkalinity employed can be problematic for some labile structures. Lectins, which are defined as carbohydrate-binding proteins that are neither antibodies nor enzymes, have a wide range of glycan binding specificities, suitable for partial characterization of a glycome. Lectin microarrays use methods and equipment similar to that employed for nucleic acid arrays. Given the large number of different lectins available, lectin microarrays can provide information about the glycome in a high-throughput fashion, which is particularly useful in profiling glycans produced by infectious organisms (Hsu et al., 2006Hsu K.L. Pilobello K.T. Mahal L.K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the future, it is highly likely that glycomics will play a central role in combating infectious disease. However, many technical issues remain to be resolved, such as standardization required for clinical use, the development of purified recombinant lectins, and better definition of the specificities of many lectins (Gupta et al., 2010Gupta G. Surolia A. Sampathkumar S.G. OMICS. 2010; 14: 419-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Both matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and electrospray mass spectrometry have played a key role in glycan profiling and in glycoproteomics (An et al., 2009An H.J. Froehlich J.W. Lebrilla C.B. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2009; 13: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, North et al., 2010North S.J. Jang-Lee J. Harrison R. Canis K. Ismail M.N. Trollope A. Antonopoulos A. Pang P.C. Grassi P. Al-Chalabi S. et al.Methods Enzymol. 2010; 478: 27-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Zaia, 2010Zaia J. OMICS. 2010; 14: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For biomarker discovery, affinity enrichment approaches, based upon chemical modification and solid-phase extraction of N-linked glycoproteins, have proven useful in profiling N-linked glycoprotein sites from serum- or even from paraffin-embedded tissues (Tian et al., 2009Tian Y. Gurley K. Meany D.L. Kemp C.J. Zhang H. J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 1657-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, using lectin binding combined with advanced mass spectrometric methods, thousands of N-glycan attachment sites have been mapped, a prerequisite for understanding their functions (Zielinska et al., 2010Zielinska D.F. Gnad F. Wiśniewski J.R. Mann M. Cell. 2010; 141: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Given the structural diversity of glycans, all of these glycomic approaches generate vast amounts of data. Glycan bioinformatics has made great strides within recent years with major efforts from several laboratories (Aoki-Kinoshita, 2008Aoki-Kinoshita K.F. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: e1000075Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At least four major publicly available carbohydrate databases (Glycosciences.de, KEGG GLYCAN, EurocarbDB, and CFG) are now maintained, and efforts to structure them in a uniform format have been in progress for quite some time. In addition, the Carbohydrate-Active EnZyme database (CAZy) has played a key role in providing a global understanding of carbohydrate active enzymes, documenting their evolutionary relationships, providing a framework for elucidating common mechanisms, and establishing the relationship between glycogenomics and glycomes expressed by cells (Cantarel et al., 2009Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (3694) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent advances in bioinformatic analysis tools for complex glycomic mass spectrometry data sets have allowed complex data to be presented in formats useful to nonexperts in all fields of biology (Ceroni et al., 2008Ceroni A. Maass K. Geyer H. Geyer R. Dell A. Haslam S.M. J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 1650-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, Goldberg et al., 2005Goldberg D. Sutton-Smith M. Paulson J. Dell A. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Perhaps one of the most important contributions to the field of functional glycomics has been the development of well-defined glycan microarrays, which currently display more than 500 different glycan structures (Smith et al., 2010Smith D.F. Song X. Cummings R.D. Methods Enzymol. 2010; 480: 417-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The NIGMS-supported Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) has generated and made publicly available custom-made DNA microarrays that represent glycosyltransferases and glycan-binding proteins. The CFG also has developed databases that present phenotypic and biochemical data on glycosyltransferase knockout mice. Even though knocking out a single glycosyltransferase gene often affects hundreds of glycoconjugates and myriad biological processes, these mutant mice have proven valuable in revealing the fundamental biological importance of glycans. The microarrays and the databases produced by the CFG member community at large are publically available on the CFG website (http://www.functionalglycomics.org) and have resulted in a profound increase in our understanding of the binding specificities of GBPs, including lectins key to inflammation and immunity, and on infectious microbes or viruses. However, a major barrier preventing glycan biology from being incorporated more into the mainstream is the continued failure by the community to adopt a universally standard glycan structural format and database that are easily accessed worldwide. Most importantly, glycan databases must eventually be incorporated into standard interactive databases that are supported by public agencies (such as NCBI or EMBL) before glycan biology can be fully integrated into the wider research community. Glycans are directly involved in almost every biological process and certainly play a major role in nearly every human disease (Figure 1). Genetic studies in tissue culture cells indicate that specific complex glycan structures are generally not essential to a cell growing in culture, indicating that most of the functions of complex glycans are at the multicellular level. In contrast, the cycling monosaccharide, O-GlcNAc, on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, is essential even at the single cell level in mammals (Hart et al., 2007Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The critical roles of glycans in mammals are now well established not only by the dearth of mutations in glycan biosynthetic enzymes that survive development, but also by the severe phenotypes generated when such mutations are not lethal. These severe phenotypes are clearly illustrated by the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) (Schachter and Freeze, 2009Schachter H. Freeze H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which are associated with severe mental and developmental abnormalities. Also, the severe muscular dystrophy that results from defective O-glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2010Yoshida-Moriguchi T. Yu L. Stalnaker S.H. Davis S. Kunz S. Madson M. Oldstone M.B. Schachter H. Wells L. Campbell K.P. Science. 2010; 327: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) further illustrates how a mutation in a glycan biosynthetic enzyme results in a devastating disease. The interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins plays a key role in the etiology of diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and cancer (Hart et al., 2007Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, Zeidan and Hart, 2010Zeidan Q. Hart G.W. J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It has long been appreciated that alterations in cell surface glycans contribute to the metastatic and neoplastic properties of tumor cells (Taniguchi, 2008Taniguchi N. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 626-627PubMed Google Scholar). The functions of many receptors are modulated by their glycans, such as modulation of Notch receptors by the action of specific glycosyltransferases (Moloney et al., 2000Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), which regulate Notch's activation by its ligands, affecting many developmental events. Selectins, which specifically bind to a subset of fucosylated and sialylated glycans, play a critical role in leukocyte homing to sites of inflammation. Indeed, a selectin inhibitor is currently in phase two clinical trials for vaso-occlusive sickle cell disease (Chang et al., 2010Chang J. Patton J.T. Sarkar A. Ernst B. Magnani J.L. Frenette P.S. Blood. 2010; 116: 1779-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Siglecs, which are a family of cell surface sialic acid-binding lectins, play a fundamental role in regulating lymphocyte functions and activation. Recent studies on galectins, a family of β-galactoside-binding lectins, have shown that they play a critical role in the organization of receptors on the cell surface and play important roles in immunity, infections, development, and inflammation (Lajoie et al., 2009Lajoie P. Goetz J.G. Dennis J.W. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans play a key role in the regulation of growth factors, in microbial binding, in tissue morphogenesis, and in the etiology of cardiovascular disease. Proteoglycans are perhaps the most complicated and information-rich molecules in biology, and progress in proteoglycomics has begun to accelerate (Ly et al., 2010Ly M. Laremore T.N. Linhardt R.J. OMICS. 2010; 14: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nearly all microbes and viruses that infect humans bind to cells by attaching to specific cell surface glycans. Glycomics and glycan arrays will have a substantial impact upon future research toward both diagnosing and preventing infectious disease. Some of the most important drugs on the market are already the result of glycomics. The anti-flu virus drugs Relenza and Tamiflu are structural analogs of sialic acids that inhibit the flu virus neuraminidase and the transmission of the virus. Natural heparin, a sulfated glycosaminoglycan, and chemically defined synthetic heparin oligosaccharides have long been widely used in the clinic as anticoagulants and for many other clinical uses. Hyaluronic acid, a nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan, is used in the treatment of arthritis. Many recombinant pharmaceuticals, including therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, are glycoproteins, and their specific glycoforms are key to their bioactivity and half lives in circulation and to their possible induction of deleterious immune responses when they do not contain the correct glycans. Given this landscape, the pharmaceutical industry and the US Food and Drug Administration are rapidly realizing the critical importance, in terms of both bioactivity and safety, of carefully defining the glycoforms of any therapeutics derived from glycoconjugates. Clinical cancer diagnostic markers are often glycoproteins, but most current diagnostic tests only measure the expression of the polypeptide. Clearly, given the long known alterations in glycans associated with cancer, it is highly likely that cancer markers that detect specific glycoforms of a protein will have much higher sensitivity and specificity for early detection of cancer (Packer et al., 2008Packer N.H. von der Lieth C.W. Aoki-Kinoshita K.F. Lebrilla C.B. Paulson J.C. Raman R. Rudd P. Sasisekharan R. Taniguchi N. York W.S. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Taniguchi, 2008Taniguchi N. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 626-627PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the convergence of glycomics and glycoproteomics is key to the discovery of biomarkers for the early detection of cancer (Taylor et al., 2009Taylor A.D. Hancock W.S. Hincapie M. Taniguchi N. Hanash S.M. Genome Med. 2009; 1: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently, the Food and Drug Administration has approved fucosylated α-fetoprotein as a diagnostic marker of primary hepatocarcinoma. In addition, fucosylated haptoglobin may be a much better marker of pancreatic cancer than simply monitoring the expression of the haptoglobin polypeptide. Indeed, The National Cancer Institute has begun an initiative to discover, develop, and clinically validate glycan biomarkers for cancer (http://glycomics.cancer.gov/). System biology analyses of the glycome to identify biomarkers of human disease will, by necessity, also employ many of the same methods used by genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics (Figure 2) (Packer et al., 2008Packer N.H. von der Lieth C.W. Aoki-Kinoshita K.F. Lebrilla C.B. Paulson J.C. Raman R. Rudd P. Sasisekharan R. Taniguchi N. York W.S. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Due to the critical roles of glycans in cardiovascular disease and lung disease and in the functions of blood cells, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has recognized an acute need to train more researchers in the area of glycosciences by creating a “Program of Excellence in Glycosciences,” which will not only support collaborative research, but will also provide hands-on laboratory training in the methods of glycosciences to fellows. Thus, though our knowledge about the biology of glycans and glycomics continues to lag behind more mainstream fields of genomics and proteomics, technological advances in glycomics in the last 5 years have begun to accelerate the integration of glycobiology into the other major fields of biomedical research. A complete mechanistic understanding of the etiology of almost any disease will depend upon the elucidation of the functions of all posttranslational modifications but will especially depend upon our understanding the many roles of glycans, the most abundant and structurally diverse type of posttranslational modification.

https://openalex.org/W1972597570,"The progressive loss of muscle strength during aging is a common degenerative event of unclear pathogenesis. Although muscle functional decline precedes age-related changes in other tissues, its contribution to systemic aging is unknown. Here, we show that muscle aging is characterized in Drosophila by the progressive accumulation of protein aggregates that associate with impaired muscle function. The transcription factor FOXO and its target 4E-BP remove damaged proteins at least in part via the autophagy/lysosome system, whereas foxo mutants have dysfunctional proteostasis. Both FOXO and 4E-BP delay muscle functional decay and extend life span. Moreover, FOXO/4E-BP signaling in muscles decreases feeding behavior and the release of insulin from producing cells, which in turn delays the age-related accumulation of protein aggregates in other tissues. These findings reveal an organism-wide regulation of proteostasis in response to muscle aging and a key role of FOXO/4E-BP signaling in the coordination of organismal and tissue aging."

The tubules are shaped by the curvature-stabilizing proteins reticulons and DP1/Yop1p, but how the sheets are formed is unclear. Here, we identify several sheet-enriched membrane proteins in the mammalian ER, including proteins that translocate and modify newly synthesized polypeptides, as well as coiled-coil membrane proteins that are highly upregulated in cells with proliferated ER sheets, all of which are localized by membrane-bound polysomes. These results indicate that sheets and tubules correspond to rough and smooth ER, respectively. One of the coiled-coil proteins, Climp63, serves as a “luminal ER spacer” and forms sheets when overexpressed. More universally, however, sheet formation appears to involve the reticulons and DP1/Yop1p, which localize to sheet edges and whose abundance determines the ratio of sheets to tubules.

We have started to address this question for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), an organelle that has a particularly intriguing morphology. It is a continuous membrane system that is comprised of the nuclear envelope as well as of a peripheral network of tubules and sheets (Baumann and Walz, 2001Baumann O. Walz B.

Both the tubules and sheets are dynamic, i.e., they are continuously forming and collapsing. Previous work has identified proteins that are responsible for shaping the tubular ER network (Hu et al., 2008Hu J. Shibata Y. Voss C. Shemesh T. Li Z. Coughlin M. Kozlov M.M. Rapoport T.A.

A class of membrane proteins shaping the tubular endoplasmic reticulum.Cell. 2006; 124: 573-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), but essentially nothing is known about how ER sheets are generated. In addition, it is unknown whether proteins specifically segregate into ER sheets and whether there is a functional significance to the existence of different ER morphologies. ER tubules are characterized by high membrane curvature in cross-section and are shaped by two families of curvature-stabilizing proteins, the reticulons and DP1/Yop1p (Voeltz et al., 2006Voeltz G.K. Prinz W.A. Shibata Y. Rist J.M. Rapoport T.A. A class of membrane proteins shaping the tubular endoplasmic reticulum.Cell. 2006; 124: 573-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Members of both families are ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotic cells. These proteins localize to the ER tubules, and their depletion leads to the loss of tubules. Conversely, the overexpression of certain isoforms results in long, unbranched tubules. Purified members of the two families deform reconstituted proteoliposomes into tubules (Hu et al., 2008Hu J. Shibata Y. Voss C. Shemesh T. Li Z. Coughlin M. Kozlov M.M. Rapoport T.A. Prinz W.A. Membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum induce high-curvature tubules.Science. 2008; 319: 1247-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that the reticulons and DP1/Yop1p are both necessary and sufficient for ER tubule formation. These two protein families do not share sequence homology, but both have a conserved domain containing two long hydrophobic segments that sit in the membrane as hairpins (Voeltz et al., 2006Voeltz G.K. Prinz W.A. Shibata Y. Rist J.M. Rapoport T.A. A class of membrane proteins shaping the tubular endoplasmic reticulum.Cell. 2006; 124: 573-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). These hairpins may stabilize the high curvature of tubules in cross-section by forming a wedge in the lipid bilayer. In addition, oligomerization of these proteins may generate arc-like scaffolds around the tubules (Shibata et al., 2008Shibata Y. Voss C. Rist J.M. Hu J. Rapoport T.A. Prinz W.A. Voeltz G.K. The reticulon and DP1/Yop1p proteins form immobile oligomers in the tubular endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18892-18904Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The peripheral ER sheets vary in size but always consist of two closely apposed membranes whose distance is approximately the same as the diameter of the tubules (∼30 nm in yeast [Bernales et al., 2006Bernales S. McDonald K.L. Walter P. Autophagy counterbalances endoplasmic reticulum expansion during the unfolded protein response.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e423Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar] and ∼50 nm in mammals). Consequently, the edges of sheets have a similarly high curvature as the cross-section of tubules. In “professional” secretory cells, such as plasma B cells or pancreatic cells, the ER sheets extend throughout the entire cell and are studded with membrane-bound ribosomes. They are stacked tightly with regular distances between the membranes on both the cytoplasmic and luminal sides (Fawcett, 1981Fawcett D.W. The Cell. W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia1981Google Scholar). By contrast, cells that do not secrete many proteins contain mostly tubular ER. These observations have led to the idea that ER sheets correspond to rough ER (Shibata et al., 2006Shibata Y. Voeltz G.K. Rapoport T.A. Rough sheets and smooth tubules.Cell. 2006; 126: 435-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), the region of the ER that contains membrane-bound ribosomes, i.e., ribosomes associated with the translocons, the sites of translocation and modification of newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins. On the other hand, ER tubules would correspond to smooth ER (Shibata et al., 2006Shibata Y. Voeltz G.K. Rapoport T.A. Rough sheets and smooth tubules.Cell. 2006; 126: 435-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), the ER region devoid of ribosomes, which may be specialized in lipid metabolism or Ca2+ signaling. While these ideas are attractive, the tubular ER clearly contains membrane-bound ribosomes, and a segregation of rough ER proteins into sheets has not yet been demonstrated. Several mechanisms of ER sheet formation have been considered. One possibility is that integral membrane proteins would form bridges across the luminal space of the ER (Senda and Yoshinaga-Hirabayashi, 1998Senda T. Yoshinaga-Hirabayashi T. Intermembrane bridges within membrane organelles revealed by quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy.Anat. Rec. 1998; 251: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, Shibata et al., 2009Shibata Y. Hu J. Kozlov M.M. Rapoport T.A. Mechanisms shaping the membranes of cellular organelles.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 329-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that proteins form flat cytoplasmic or luminal scaffolds, as suggested for the formation of flat Golgi cisternae (Short et al., 2005Short B. Haas A. Barr F.A. Golgins and GTPases, giving identity and structure to the Golgi apparatus.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that the membrane association of ribosomes could directly be responsible for the generation of ER sheets (Puhka et al., 2007Puhka M. Vihinen H. Joensuu M. Jokitalo E. Endoplasmic reticulum remains continuous and undergoes sheet-to-tubule transformation during cell division in mammalian cells.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Finally, given that the reticulons and DP1/Yop1p generate high curvature membranes, one might imagine that they generate sheets by stabilizing the sheet edges, bringing the apposing membranes in close proximity (Shibata et al., 2009Shibata Y. Hu J. Kozlov M.M. Rapoport T.A. Mechanisms shaping the membranes of cellular organelles.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 329-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Here, we show that rough ER proteins partition into ER sheets. This includes both proteins involved in translocation and modification of newly synthesized polypeptides, as well as coiled-coil membrane proteins that are highly upregulated in cells containing proliferated ER sheets. Membrane-bound polysomes are required for the segregation of these rough ER proteins into sheets, and one of the coiled-coil proteins, Climp63, serves as a luminal ER spacer. However, neither the polysomes nor the coiled-coil proteins are essential for sheet formation per se. Instead, a major mechanism of sheet formation appears to involve the reticulons and DP1/Yop1p proteins, which can stabilize the high membrane curvature at sheet edges. Our results suggest that, in many cells, their abundance is the major determinant of ER morphology. The different morphologies of the ER imply that, despite the continuity of the membrane system, some proteins are likely enriched in certain domains. So far, the only proteins known with a specific localization are the tubule-preferring reticulons, DP1/Yop1p, and atlastins/Sey1p (Hu et al., 2009Hu J. Shibata Y. Zhu P.P. Voss C. Rismanchi N.

Chem. 2008; 283: 18892-18904Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, Voeltz et al., 2006Voeltz G.K. Prinz W.A. Shibata Y. Rist J.M. Rapoport T.A. A class of membrane proteins shaping the tubular endoplasmic reticulum.Cell. 2006; 124: 573-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). These proteins localize to tubules even when highly overexpressed. By contrast, other overexpressed ER proteins distribute indiscriminately throughout the entire ER, making it impossible to draw conclusions about their endogenous localizations. We therefore first tested whether several endogenous ER proteins segregate into different ER domains using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy in BSC1 cells. As expected, the luminal ER protein calreticulin, which is involved in the folding of glycoproteins, was found in peripheral ER sheets, which are mostly located close to the nucleus, as well as in the tubular ER network and the nuclear envelope (Figure 1A ). Calreticulin almost perfectly colocalized with GFP-tagged Sec61β, stably overexpressed in the same cell. Endogenous Sec61β is part of the Sec61 complex, the component forming the protein-conducting channel in the ER, but due to its tagging with GFP and overexpression, GFP-Sec61β is not associated with the translocon and distributes throughout the ER (Shibata et al., 2008Shibata Y. Voss C. Rist J.M. Hu J. Rapoport T.A. Prinz W.A. Voeltz G.K. The reticulon and DP1/Yop1p proteins form immobile oligomers in the tubular endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18892-18904Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Antibodies recognizing the luminal chaperones BiP and Grp94 (anti-KDEL) also stained the entire ER (Figure 1C, middle). The integral membrane proteins calnexin and Bap31 showed a similar ubiquitous localization as overexpressed GFP-Sec61β (Figure 1B and Figure S1 available online). These results suggest that many luminal and membrane ER proteins do not localize to a specific ER domain, consistent with the continuity of the membrane system.Figure S1The Membrane Protein Bap31 Localizes to all ER Domains, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) The localization of endogenous Bap31 is compared with that of the stably overexpressed membrane protein GFP-Sec61β using confocal microscopy in BSC1 cells.

(B) The localization of endogenous Bap31 is compared with that of endogenous TRAPα using confocal microscopy in COS7 cells. Note that the localization of Bap31 does not change whether or not Sec61β is overexpressed. Scale bar, 10 μm. Next, we tested the endogenous localization of components of the translocon. In contrast to overexpressed GFP-Sec61β, endogenous Sec61β was found concentrated in ER sheets when compared to the localization of the luminal ER proteins BiP and GRP94 (Figure 1C), although some weak staining of the tubular network and nonspecific staining of the cytoplasm were also seen. Because endogenous Sec61β is contained in the Sec61 complex, these data suggest that translocons are enriched in ER sheets. This is supported by the localization of endogenous TRAPα, a component tightly associated with the ribosome-bound Sec61 complex (Ménétret et al., 2008Ménétret J.F. Hegde R.S. Aguiar M. Gygi S.P. Park E. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Single copies of Sec61 and TRAP associate with a nontranslating mammalian ribosome.Structure. 2008; 16: 1126-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); TRAPα was strongly enriched in the peripheral ER sheets (Figure 1D). Finally, Dad1, a component of the translocon-associated oligosaccharyl transferase complex that glycosylates nascent secretory and membrane proteins, also showed a similar localization; GFP-tagged Dad1 that was stably expressed in Dad1-deficient cells at a level just sufficient to sustain viability (Nikonov et al., 2002Nikonov A.V. Snapp E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Kreibich G. Active translocon complexes labeled with GFP-Dad1 diffuse slowly as large polysome arrays in the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed a clear preference for ER sheets, in contrast to calreticulin in the same cell (Figure 1E). Together, these data indicate that translocon components are enriched in ER sheets. To identify additional sheet-segregating proteins that could potentially be required for sheet formation, we reasoned that such proteins would be abundant in highly secretory cells that contain proliferated ER sheets. We therefore identified by mass spectrometry the most abundant, integral ER membrane proteins in dog pancreatic rough microsomes. The 25 most abundant proteins include translocon components, such as subunits of the oligosaccharyl transferase complex, signal peptidase, SRP receptor, components of the TRAP complex, and the Sec61 complex (Table S1). Of interest, the list also includes p180 and Climp63. Kinectin, which is sequence related to p180, is somewhat less abundant. All of these proteins have a single transmembrane segment and an extended coiled-coil domain, which is located on the luminal side of the ER membrane in the case of Climp63 and on the cytoplasmic side in the case of p180 and kinectin (Figure S2A ). The molecular function of these coiled-coil proteins is not well understood. Climp63 has been implicated in the interaction of ER membranes with microtubules (Klopfenstein et al., 1998Klopfenstein D.R. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. A novel direct interaction of endoplasmic reticulum with microtubules.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6168-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). P180 was originally proposed to be a ribosome receptor (Savitz and Meyer, 1990Savitz A.J. Meyer D.I. Identification of a ribosome receptor in the rough endoplasmic reticulum.Nature. 1990; 346: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); it also interacts with microtubules (Ogawa-Goto et al., 2007Ogawa-Goto K. Tanaka K. Ueno T. Tanaka K. Kurata T. Sata T. Irie S. p180 is involved in the interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules through a novel microtubule-binding and bundling domain.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and is now thought to play a role in the differentiation of certain monocytic cells (Benyamini et al., 2009Benyamini P. Webster P. Meyer D.I. Knockdown of p180 eliminates the terminal differentiation of a secretory cell line.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 732-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Kinectin was initially identified as a receptor for the molecular motor kinesin (Toyoshima et al., 1992Toyoshima I. Yu H. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. Kinectin, a major kinesin-binding protein on ER.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Another way to identify potential sheet-segregating proteins is to analyze components that are upregulated during the differentiation of immature B cells to IgG-secreting plasma cells, which involves massive ER sheet proliferation. To identify mRNAs whose abundance is greatly increased, we sorted through published microarray data (Luckey et al., 2006Luckey C.J. Bhattacharya D. Goldrath A.W. Weissman I.L. Benoist C. Mathis D. Memory T and memory B cells share a transcriptional program of self-renewal with long-term hematopoietic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The list of the 25 most upregulated mRNAs coding for ER membrane proteins (Table S2) includes components of the translocon, of the unfolded protein response, and of the ER protein degradation machinery. It also includes Climp63 and p180 (their mRNAs are upregulated by a factor of 19–26; kinectin mRNA was not analyzed). Together with the mass spectrometry data, these results raise the possibility that the coiled-coil membrane proteins Climp63, p180, and kinectin localize to ER sheets. Because these proteins have no known function in protein translocation or modification, they are also candidates for being involved in sheet formation. Next, we tested whether the coiled-coil proteins are enriched in ER sheets, using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. At endogenous levels, all three proteins indeed segregated to ER sheets, whereas in the same cells, calreticulin distributed throughout the entire ER (Figures 2A–2C ). P180-GFP overexpressed at moderate levels was also enriched in ER sheets (Figure S2B). Thus, in addition to the translocon proteins, at least three other abundant integral membrane proteins are enriched in ER sheets. All three proteins were noticeably depleted from the nuclear envelope (Figure 2 and Figure S2), as reported previously for Climp63 (Klopfenstein et al., 1998Klopfenstein D.R. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. A novel direct interaction of endoplasmic reticulum with microtubules.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6168-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because translocon-associated proteins were found enriched in ER sheets and are also generally associated with ribosomes, we tested whether the sheet-preferring proteins are localized by their association with membrane-bound translating ribosomes. We treated tissue culture cells with puromycin, a drug that releases nascent polypeptide chains from ribosomes and disassembles polysomes; the localization of endogenous sheet-preferring proteins was subsequently analyzed by immunofluorescence. TRAPα moved into the tubular network (Figure 3A ). Quantification shows that, in untreated cells, TRAPα is enriched in sheets, as compared to the general ER marker GFP-Sec61β, but 15 min after puromycin addition, TRAPα was almost equally abundant in sheets and tubules (Figure 3E). The disassembly of the polysomes did not abolish the ER sheets, which in fact occupied a larger surface in many cells (Figure S3A ). To rule out the possibility that inhibition of translation causes the redistribution of TRAPα, we performed control experiments with cycloheximide, a drug that inhibits the elongation of polypeptide chains but leaves polysomes intact. Cycloheximide inhibited protein synthesis as effectively as puromycin (Figure S4), but TRAPα stayed in ER sheets (Figures 3B and 3E). All of the other tested ER sheet-preferring proteins behaved in the same way as TRAPα (Figures 3C–3E). On the other hand, the localization of calnexin and Bap31, membrane proteins that did not segregate into ER sheets, remained unchanged after treatment with either puromycin or cycloheximide, as was also the case for the luminal protein calreticulin (Figure 3E and Figures S3B and S3C). Pactamycin, an inhibitor of translation initiation, which allows ribosomes to run off the mRNAs, had a similar effect as puromycin on sheet-segregating proteins, i.e., they were no longer concentrated in sheets (Figure S3D). Again, the sheets did not disappear but often occupied a larger area of the cell (Figure S3E). These results indicate that polysomes concentrate sheet domains and localize certain membrane proteins to ER sheets, likely because these proteins have a direct or indirect affinity for membrane-bound polysomes.Figure S3ER Morphology Changes and Protein Redistribution upon Disassembly of Polysomes, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) The localization of the translocon component TRAPα and of Climp63 was visualized after 15 min of treatment with puromycin.

Total protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To test for a possible role of the coiled-coil membrane proteins in ER morphology, we performed RNAi experiments. The depletion of Climp63, p180, and kinectin (Figure S5A ) either individually or together did not abolish the existence of ER sheets (Figure 2D versus 2E). Nevertheless, these proteins have an effect on ER morphology, as the sheets in depleted cells spread throughout the cytoplasm (Figures S5B and S5C), similarly to what is observed when cells are treated with puromycin or pactamycin (Figure S3). It thus seems that the coiled-coil membrane proteins are not required for sheet formation per se may but function in segregating sheet domains close to the cell nucleus. Thin-section electron microscopy of COS7 cells confirmed that peripheral ER sheets persist after puromycin treatment or depletion of Climp63, p180, and kinectin (compare Figures 4B and 4C with 4A ). No bulging of the two membrane sheets was observed, but of interest, the luminal width was significantly reduced in triple knockdown cells (from 45–50 nm to 25–30 nm; Figure 4E). A similar effect was seen when Climp63 alone was depleted (Figures 4D and 4E), whereas single or double knockdown of p180 and kinectin had no obvious phenotype (Figure 4E and data not shown). These results indicate that Climp63 serves to maintain the normal luminal width of peripheral ER sheets, likely by forming bridges through their luminal coiled-coil domains (Klopfenstein et al., 2001Klopfenstein D.R.

https://openalex.org/W2091174536,"The mechanism by which CD4 T cells are depleted in HIV-infected hosts remains poorly understood. In ex vivo cultures of human tonsil tissue, CD4 T cells undergo a pronounced cytopathic response following HIV infection. Strikingly, >95% of these dying cells are not productively infected but instead correspond to bystander cells. We now show that the death of these ""bystander"" cells involves abortive HIV infection. Inhibitors blocking HIV entry or early steps of reverse transcription prevent CD4 T cell death while inhibition of later events in the viral life cycle does not. We demonstrate that the nonpermissive state exhibited by the majority of resting CD4 tonsil T cells leads to accumulation of incomplete reverse transcripts. These cytoplasmic nucleic acids activate a host defense program that elicits a coordinated proapoptotic and proinflammatory response involving caspase-3 and caspase-1 activation. While this response likely evolved to protect the host, it centrally contributes to the immunopathogenic effects of HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2093705507,"Crystal structures of prokaryotic ribosomes have described in detail the universally conserved core of the translation mechanism. However, many facets of the translation process in eukaryotes are not shared with prokaryotes. The crystal structure of the yeast 80S ribosome determined at 4.15 angstrom resolution reveals the higher complexity of eukaryotic ribosomes, which are 40% larger than their bacterial counterparts. Our model shows how eukaryote-specific elements considerably expand the network of interactions within the ribosome and provides insights into eukaryote-specific features of protein synthesis. Our crystals capture the ribosome in the ratcheted state, which is essential for translocation of mRNA and transfer RNA (tRNA), and in which the small ribosomal subunit has rotated with respect to the large subunit. We describe the conformational changes in both ribosomal subunits that are involved in ratcheting and their implications in coordination between the two associated subunits and in mRNA and tRNA translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2057815562,"Amyloid-β oligomers may cause cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease by impairing neuronal NMDA-type glutamate receptors, whose function is regulated by the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2. Here we show that amyloid-β oligomers bind to the fibronectin repeats domain of EphB2 and trigger EphB2 degradation in the proteasome. To determine the pathogenic importance of EphB2 depletions in Alzheimer's disease and related models, we used lentiviral constructs to reduce or increase neuronal expression of EphB2 in memory centres of the mouse brain. In nontransgenic mice, knockdown of EphB2 mediated by short hairpin RNA reduced NMDA receptor currents and impaired long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus, which are important for memory formation. Increasing EphB2 expression in the dentate gyrus of human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice reversed deficits in NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation and memory impairments. Thus, depletion of EphB2 is critical in amyloid-β-induced neuronal dysfunction. Increasing EphB2 levels or function could be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2028824678,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) originates from self-renewing leukemic stem cells (LSCs), an ultimate therapeutic target for AML. Here we identified T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) as a surface molecule expressed on LSCs in most types of AML except for acute promyelocytic leukemia, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). TIM-3(+) but not TIM-3⁻ AML cells reconstituted human AML in immunodeficient mice, suggesting that the TIM-3(+) population contains most, if not all, of functional LSCs. We established an anti-human TIM-3 mouse IgG2a antibody having complement-dependent and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic activities. This antibody did not harm reconstitution of normal human HSCs, but blocked engraftment of AML after xenotransplantation. Furthermore, when it is administered into mice grafted with human AML, this treatment dramatically diminished their leukemic burden and eliminated LSCs capable of reconstituting human AML in secondary recipients. These data suggest that TIM-3 is one of the promising targets to eradicate AML LSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2084284022,"A novel paradigm in tumor biology suggests that cancer growth is driven by stem-like cells within a tumor, called tumor-initiating cells (TICs) or cancer stem cells (CSCs). Here we describe the identification and characterization of such cells from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using the marker CD133. CD133 accounts for approximately 1.3%–13.6% of the cells in the bulk tumor of human primary HCC samples. When compared with their CD133− counterparts, CD133+ cells not only possess the preferential ability to form undifferentiated tumor spheroids in vitro but also express an enhanced level of stem cell-associated genes, have a greater ability to form tumors when implanted orthotopically in immunodeficient mice, and can be serially passaged into secondary animal recipients. Xenografts resemble the original human tumor and maintain a similar percentage of tumorigenic CD133+ cells. Quantitative PCR analysis of 41 separate HCC tissue specimens with follow-up data found that CD133+ tumor cells were frequently detected at low quantities in HCC, and their presence was also associated with worse overall survival and higher recurrence rates. Subsequent differential microRNA expression profiling of CD133+ and CD133− cells from human HCC clinical specimens and cell lines identified an overexpression of miR-130b in CD133+ TICs. Functional studies on miR-130b lentiviral-transduced CD133− cells demonstrated superior resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, enhanced tumorigenicity in vivo, and a greater potential for self renewal. Conversely, antagonizing miR-130b in CD133+ TICs yielded an opposing effect. The increased miR-130b paralleled the reduced TP53INP1, a known miR-130b target.

The tumor-initiating cell (TIC) or cancer stem cell (CSC) concept suggests that tumors are organized in a hierarchy of mixed tumor cells and that sitting at the apex is a subset of cancer cells that are biologically distinct from the others and bear stem cell-like features, which are indispensable for a tumor. These TICs possess both self renewal and differentiation capabilities and are believed to give rise to tumor heterogeneity (Visvader and Lindeman, 2008Visvader J.E. Lindeman G.J.

Thus, TIC eradication may be critical to achieving stable remission of, and even curing, aggressive malignancies. To date, the perpetuations of many cancer types, including leukemia, breast cancer, brain cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been suggested to stem from TICs. HCC ranks as the fifth most prevalent cancer worldwide, affecting 1 million individuals annually (Jemal et al., 2009Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Hao Y. Xu J. Thun M.J. Cancer statistics, 2009.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2009; 59: 225-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9696) Google Scholar). Surgical resection and liver transplantation are available for early-stage HCC, but because most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, only 25% of patients with this cancer are amenable to surgery. Chemotherapy is one of the main treatments given to the remaining patients with inoperable HCC and is also administered as a pre-/postsurgical adjuvant therapy, yet the overall response rate to this treatment is low due to the highly chemotherapy-resistant nature of the disease (Aravalli et al., 2008Aravalli R.N. Steer C.J. Cressman E.N. Molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma.Hepatology. 2008; 48: 2047-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the mechanism underlying hepatocarcinogenesis is essential for managing HCC. Recently, we have identified a TIC population from HCC cells and xenograft tumors that is marked by a CD133 surface phenotype and bears features that include the abilities to self renew; differentiate into non-hepatocyte-like, angiomyogenic-like lineages; initiate tumors in vivo and resist standard chemotherapy via the Akt/PKB and Bcl-2 pathways (Ma et al., 2007Ma S.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by inhibiting ribosome function, decapping the 5′cap structure, deadenylating the poly(A) tail, and degrading the target mRNA (He and Hannon, 2004He L.

MicroRNA control of signal transduction.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 252-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). One of the best-studied miRNAs, let-7 in C. elegans, was initially identified in mutants with defects in developmental timing (Reinhart et al., 2000Reinhart B.J. Slack F.J. Basson M. Pasquinelli A.E. Bettinger J.C. Rougvie A.E. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. The 21-nucleotide let-7 RNA regulates developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2000; 403: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar). The loss of dicer1, an important endonuclease for the synthesis of mature miRNAs, also induces embryonic lethality and depletion of stem cells (Bernstein et al., 2003Bernstein E. Kim S.Y. Carmell M.A. Murchison E.P. Alcorn H. Li M.Z. Mills A.A. Elledge S.J. Anderson K.V. Hannon G.J. Dicer is essential for mouse development.Nat.

In addition, tissue-specific deletion of dicer affects the self renewal of embryonic stem cells, the development of B lymphocyte lineage cells, and tissue morphogenesis (Chen et al., 2008Chen J.F.

The deletion of DGCR8, another key enzyme for miRNA processing, alters the silencing of self-renewal genes in embryonic stem cells (Wang et al., 2007Wang Y. Medvid R. Melton C. Jaenisch R. Blelloch R. DGCR8 is essential for microRNA biogenesis and silencing of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Moreover, a distinct miRNA subset is specifically expressed in pluripotent embryonic stem cells but not in adult tissues (Suh et al., 2004Suh M.R. Lee Y. Kim J.Y. Kim S.K. Moon S.H. Lee J.Y. Cha K.Y. Chung H.M. Yoon H.S. Moon S.Y. et al.Human embryonic stem cells express a unique set of microRNAs.Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating cell-fate decisions, some miRNAs can also function as tumor promoters or suppressors, regulating the maintenance and progression of cancers and TICs (DeSano and Xu, 2009DeSano J.T. Xu L. MicroRNA regulation of cancer stem cells and therapeutic implications.AAPS J. 2009; 11: 682-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, Esquela-Kerscher and Slack, 2006Esquela-Kerscher A.

The expression of let-7 prevents tumor sphere formation in breast cancer cell lines and inhibits tumorigenicity in an in vivo xenograft tumor assay (Yu et al., 2007Yu F. Yao H. Zhu P. Zhang X. Pan Q.

Elevated miR-181 family members were identified as critical players in regulating EpCAM+ hepatic TICs (Ji et al., 2009Ji J. Yamashita T. Budhu A. Forgues M. Jia H.L. Li C. Deng C. Wauthier E. Reid L.M. Ye Q.H. et al.Identification of microRNA-181 by genome-wide screening as a critical player in EpCAM-positive hepatic cancer stem cells.Hepatology. 2009; 50: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and the downregulation of miR-200 family miRNAs suggests that normal stem cells and breast cancer stem cells share common molecular mechanisms that regulate stem cell functions, such as self renewal, proliferation, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Shimono et al., 2009Shimono Y. Zabala M. Cho R.W. Lobo N. Dalerba P. Qian D. Diehn M. Liu H. Panula S.P.

Finally, miRNA expression profiles have been correlated with the tumor stage, progression, and prognosis of cancer patients (Jiang et al., 2008Jiang J. Gusev Y. Aderca I. Mettler T.A. Nagorney D.M.

These findings demonstrate that miRNAs are critical regulators of self renewal, differentiation, and carcinogenesis. To date, CD133 has only been used to identify liver TICs in cell-line-based models. The characterization of this specific population of cells is also very limited. In this study, we first validated CD133 as a marker for liver TICs in freshly resected HCC clinical specimens and identified a prognostic role of CD133 in HCC. Subsequently, we elucidated the underlying molecular mechanism by which this specific population of cells mediates tumor formation and growth by a systematic comparison of the miRNA profiles in CD133+ liver TICs and their differentiated progeny. Our findings suggest that HCC maintenance and growth is dictated, at least in part, by a CD133+-expressing subpopulation and that miR-130b regulates the growth and self renewal of CD133+ liver TICs via the direct targeting of TP53INP1. Previous work from our laboratory identified a TIC population marked by the CD133 surface phenotype in HCC xenograft tumors and cell lines. CD133+ cells were found capable of extensive proliferation, exhibited an increased potential to self renew and differentiate, expressed stem cell-associated markers and were maintained at a low frequency in the bulk of the tumor mass (Ma et al., 2007Ma S. Chan K.W. Hu L. Lee T.K. Wo J.Y. Ng I.O. Zheng B.J. Guan X.Y. Identification and characterization of tumorigenic liver cancer stem/progenitor cells.Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 2542-2556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). CD133+ cells also contribute to HCC chemoresistance through Akt/PKB and Bcl-2 pathway activations (Ma et al., 2008Ma S. Lee T.K. Zheng B.J. Chan K.W. Guan X.Y. CD133+ HCC cancer stem cells confer chemoresistance by preferential expression of the Akt/PKB survival pathway.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1749-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The identification and characterization of a CD133+ TIC population in HCC xenograft tumors and cell lines suggested that CD133 may also represent a TIC marker in primary human HCC specimens. Therefore, as a first step, we examined the expression of CD133 in fresh tissue samples derived from patients with HCC using both flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC). In total, 35 individual patients were analyzed. Flow cytometry demonstrated the presence of a rare CD133 population in HCC specimens, with expression ranging from 1.3% to 13.6% (Figure 1A ). A potential contamination of the CD133+ cell population by hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors was excluded by flow cytometry using CD45 and CD31, respectively. CD133+ cells were negative for the panhematopoietic marker CD45, and less than 1.3% of the CD133+ subpopulation was putative CD31+ endothelial progenitors (Figure 2A ). Consistently, histological analysis revealed that similar percentages of CD133+ cells were localized in the bulk tumor (Figure 1B). All HCC samples reproducibly demonstrated the presence of only a rare CD133+ population, while, in contrast, CD133 expression in nontumor (NT) liver tissues was almost nonexistent (Figures 1A and 1B). Due to the short follow-up period after the fresh clinical specimens were collected, the association between CD133 expression and disease-free survival or overall survival could not be calculated. However, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis of 41 HCC tissue specimens that we had collected earlier and for which we have follow-up data showed that increased CD133 expression in HCC not only correlated with advanced disease stage but also was associated with higher recurrence rates and worse overall survival. Increased CD133 expression in HCC was more associated with higher tumor stages (T stages III or IV) than with lower tumor stages (T stages I or II) (χ2 test, p = 0.008; Figure 1C and Table S1). Furthermore, an association study showed the CD133 ΔCt value to be inversely correlated with tumor stage in these 41 HCC patients (n = 38, Pearson correlation, r = −0.428, χ2 test, p = 0.007). In a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with CD133+ primary tumors displayed worse disease-free survival (estimated mean = 13.75 months) when compared to those patients with CD133-/low primary tumors (estimated mean = 61.49 months) (log-rank test, p = 0.001; Figure 1D). In addition, CD133 expression was also associated with long-term overall survival. Patients with CD133+ primary tumors had a mean overall survival of 27.11 months, as compared with 78.51 months for patients with CD133−/low primary tumors (log-rank test, p < 0.001). Univariate Cox regression analysis also identified that the tumor stage was significantly associated with disease-free survival and that the CD133 expression was correlated with both disease-free and overall survival (Table S2). CD133 expression was, however, not significantly associated with age, gender, α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, or tumor size (Table S1).Figure 2Tumorigenic and Stem Cell-like Potential of CD133+ Cells in Patient-Derived HCC SamplesShow full caption(A) A flow cytometry dot plot shows the distribution of CD133+ cells in unsorted and sorted freshly resected human HCC specimens.

(C) CD133+ TICs were able to generate an increased number of primary and serially passaged spheroids as compared with CD133− cells in freshly isolated tumors. (D–F) A flow cytometry histogram analysis shows the enrichment of CD133 expression in mechanically dissociated CD133+ spheroids (purple; “spheroid”) as compared to the differentiated adherent counterpart (dotted green; “differentiated”). qPCR analysis was performed for stem cell-associated and multiple-drug-resistant transporter genes in (E) mechanically dissociated cancer spheroids (“S”) versus primary adherent HCC cells (“D”) and (F) CD133+ TICs versus CD133− cells isolated from freshly resected tumors. Differentiated adherent cells and CD133− were defined as 1 (calibrator), and the relative expression of each gene was expressed as the fold difference over this baseline. β-actin was used as an internal control. Next, we evaluated the tumorigenic potential and stem cell-like properties of isolated CD133+ TICs from freshly resected HCC. Preliminary data demonstrated that following tumor dissociation into single cells, cells must be at least 70% viable in order for experiments like in vivo tumorigenicity assays and in vitro spheroid formation assays to be successful. Among the 83 matched NT and HCC specimens collected, cells isolated from only one-fourth (n = 21) of the tumor specimens showed >70% cell viability. Thus, only these 21 samples were used for further downstream studies, following initial screening for CD133 expression by flow cytometry (n = 35). Following the removal of dead cells, CD133+ TICs were isolated by magnetic bead sorting, which resulted in a considerable enrichment of CD133+ cells (purity 82%–92%) and, more importantly, a higher negative selection (purity >98%) of CD133− cells. Again, potential contamination of the CD133+ cell population by hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors was excluded by flow cytometry using CD45 and CD31, respectively (Figure 2A; bottom). Following sorting, we investigated the ability of tumor-derived CD133+ and CD133− cells to orthotopically engraft and give rise to tumors in SCID/Beige mice. As many as 5 × 105 patient-derived CD133− HCC cells resuspended in Matrigel were needed to initiate occasional tumor formation, while, in contrast, as few as 2 × 104 CD133+ cells resuspended in Matrigel generated visible tumors 8 weeks postinjection (Figure 2B and Table S3; data representative of eight tumors tested). These data indicate that cells capable of initiating HCC are highly enriched within a CD133+ cell population. Additionally, histological analysis revealed that tumor xenografts derived from CD133+ cells consistently reproduced the primary tumor at the histological level (data not shown). To investigate whether CD133+ HCC cells display long-term tumorigenic potential, we evaluated their ability to generate tumors in serial transplantations. Sorted CD133+ and CD133− cells from primary tumor xenografts were transplanted into secondary mouse recipients. Only CD133+ tumor cells successfully engrafted. Secondary tumors grew better, as evident by the number of tumor-bearing mice (83% in secondary xenografts versus 65% in primary xenografts), and they grew more rapidly than those tumors in the primary xenografts (Figure 2B). Tumor morphologies were indistinguishable from either tumors generated from primary animal recipients or original tumors. Thus, the CD133+ cell population resident in the HCC tumor mass could generate serial xenografts, suggesting an in vivo self-renewing capacity. Next, we examined the ability of CD133+ TICs and CD133− cells to grow as spheroids in nonadherent, serum-free, growth factor-supplemented conditions that favor the proliferation of undifferentiated cells. Within 3 weeks of culture, we obtained HCC spheres of growing undifferentiated CD133+ cells. CD133− tumor cells invariably died in such serum-free conditions (Figure 2C; data representative of seven tumors tested). More importantly, single cells obtained from these CD133+ dissociated spheres could be clonally expanded in subsequent serial propagations, showing virtually unlimited growth potential. When CD133+ cells were grown as HCC spheres, these cells remained CD133+. To determine the differentiation potential of these CD133+ cells, tumor spheres were cultivated without EGF and FGF2 in the presence of 10% serum. After several days of culture, the spheres differentiated, attached onto the flasks, and grew as adherent cells. As compared with undifferentiated spheres, adherent counterparts expressed less CD133 expression following induced in vitro differentiation (Figure 2D; data representative of seven tumors tested). The ability of CD133+ cells to form spheres and be serially propagated suggests an in vitro self-renewing capacity. Similarly, the proportions of stem cell-associated genes, including Bmi-1, Notch 1, Sox2, Oct-4, nanog, β-catenin, Smo, and nestin, and multidrug resistance transporters ABCG2 and ABCB1 were reduced following in vitro differentiation of CD133+ TIC spheres (Figure 2E; data representative of three tumors tested). In addition, patient-derived CD133+ TICs also expressed an enhanced level of stem cell-associated genes, including nanog, Oct-4, ABCB1, and Sox2, when compared with their CD133− tumor counterparts (Figure 2F; data representative of three tumors tested). Collectively, these data demonstrate the existence of a TIC population in HCC marked by a CD133 surface phenotype and bearing cancer and stem cell-like features including the ability to self renew, differentiate, and initiate tumors in vivo. Following the identification of CD133+ liver TICs, we furthered our study to characterize the underlying mechanism that drives this population of cells and their role in tumor progression. miRNAs are recognized as important regulators of posttranscriptional gene expression, regulating both cellular differentiation and embry"
https://openalex.org/W2008675991,"Histone variant H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes are incorporated at most eukaryotic promoters. This incorporation is mediated by the conserved SWR1 complex, which replaces histone H2A in canonical nucleosomes with H2A.Z in an ATP-dependent manner. Here, we show that promoter-proximal nucleosomes are highly heterogeneous for H2A.Z in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with substantial representation of nucleosomes containing one, two, or zero H2A.Z molecules. SWR1-catalyzed H2A.Z replacement in vitro occurs in a stepwise and unidirectional fashion, one H2A.Z-H2B dimer at a time, producing heterotypic nucleosomes as intermediates and homotypic H2A.Z nucleosomes as end products. The ATPase activity of SWR1 is specifically stimulated by H2A-containing nucleosomes without ensuing histone H2A eviction. Remarkably, further addition of free H2A.Z-H2B dimer leads to hyperstimulation of ATPase activity, eviction of nucleosomal H2A-H2B, and deposition of H2A.Z-H2B. These results suggest that the combination of H2A-containing nucleosome and free H2A.Z-H2B dimer acting as both effector and substrate for SWR1 governs the specificity and outcome of the replacement reaction."

DNA replication and Smc3 acetylation promote binding of Sororin to cohesin Sororin displaces Wapl from Pds5 and thereby stabilizes cohesin on DNA The stabilization of cohesin on DNA is required for sister chromatid cohesion Dalmatian is a Drosophila ortholog of Sororin In eukaryotic cells, sister chromatids remain physically connected from the time of their synthesis during DNA replication until their separation during mitosis or meiosis. This sister chromatid cohesion is essential for biorientation of chromosomes on the spindle and for DNA-damage repair (reviewed in Nasmyth and Haering, 2009Nasmyth K. Haering C.H.

Schmitz J. The cohesin complex and its roles in chromosome biology.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3089-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Cohesion is mediated by cohesin complexes. Three cohesin subunits, the ATPases Smc1 and Smc3 and the kleisin Scc1/Rad21/Mcd1, form triangular structures that have been proposed to mediate cohesion by embracing sister chromatids (Gruber et al., 2003Gruber S. Haering C.H. Nasmyth K. Chromosomal cohesin forms a ring.Cell. 2003; 112: 765-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar; for an illustration of this “ring model,” see Figure 6C below). Scc1 binds to a fourth core subunit, called Scc3 in yeast and stromal antigen (SA) in vertebrates, where somatic cells contain two SA paralogs (SA1 and SA2). Scc1 and SA proteins are further associated with a heterodimer of two proteins, called Wapl and Pds5, the latter of which also exists in two isoforms in vertebrates (Pds5A and Pds5B; Gandhi et al., 2006Gandhi R. Gillespie P.J. Hirano T. Human Wapl is a cohesin-binding protein that promotes sister-chromatid resolution in mitotic prophase.Curr.

Cohesin complexes are loaded onto DNA before replication (in animal cells already in telophase) and establish cohesion during replication. In the subsequent mitosis, cohesion is dissolved by removal of cohesin from chromosomes. In vertebrate cells, this process occurs in two steps (Waizenegger et al., 2000Waizenegger I.C. Hauf S. Meinke A. Peters J.M. Two distinct pathways remove mammalian cohesin from chromosome arms in prophase and from centromeres in anaphase.Cell. 2000; 103: 399-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar): the bulk of cohesin is removed from chromosomes in prophase by a mechanism that depends on Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1/Plx1) and Wapl (Gandhi et al., 2006Gandhi R.

Wapl controls the dynamic association of cohesin with chromatin.Cell. 2006; 127: 955-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). At centromeres, small amounts of cohesin are protected from the prophase pathway by Shugoshin, and these complexes can only be removed from chromosomes by the protease separase (reviewed in Sakuno and Watanabe, 2009Sakuno T. Watanabe Y. Studies of meiosis disclose distinct roles of cohesion in the core centromere and pericentromeric regions.Chromosome Res. 2009; 17: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This process occurs only in metaphase because a surveillance mechanism called the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents separase activation until all chromosomes have been bioriented. The SAC inhibits APC/CCdc20 (anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome associated with Cdc20), a complex whose ubiquitin ligase activity is required for separase activation (reviewed in Peters, 2006Peters J.M. The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome: a machine designed to destroy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). How cohesion is established and maintained is poorly understood. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments in mammalian cells revealed that cohesin binds to DNA much more stably after than before DNA replication, suggesting that cohesion depends on an unidentified event during DNA replication that stabilizes cohesin on DNA (Gerlich et al., 2006Gerlich D. Koch B. Dupeux F. Peters J.M. Ellenberg J. Live-cell imaging reveals a stable cohesin-chromatin interaction after but not before DNA replication.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1571-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The dynamic mode of cohesin binding to DNA might depend on Wapl because depletion of this protein from mammalian cells does not only interfere with the prophase pathway but also increases the residence time of cohesin on chromatin during interphase (Kueng et al., 2006Kueng S. Hegemann B. Peters B.H. Lipp J.J. Schleiffer A. Mechtler K. Peters J.M. Wapl controls the dynamic association of cohesin with chromatin.Cell. 2006; 127: 955-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The only molecular event during DNA replication that is known to be essential for cohesion establishment is acetylation of cohesin (Ben-Shahar et al., 2008Ben-Shahar T. Heeger S. Lehane C. East P.

This modification occurs on two lysine residues in the ATPase domain of Smc3 (K112/113 in budding yeast) and is catalyzed by the acetyltransferase Eco1. The lethality of yeast that is caused by deletion of the ECO1 gene can be suppressed by changing K112/113 to residues that might functionally mimic acetylated lysine but also by deletion of the WPL1/RAD61 gene, which encodes a Wapl ortholog, and by mutations in Pds5 (Ben-Shahar et al., 2008Ben-Shahar T.

Cohesin is also acetylated in mammalian cells on Smc3 residues K105/106 (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang J. Shi X. Li Y. Kim B.J. Jia J. Huang Z. Yang T. Fu X. Jung S.Y. Wang Y. et al.Acetylation of Smc3 by Eco1 is required for S phase sister chromatid cohesion in both human and yeast.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), where two Eco1 orthologs exist, called Esco1 and Esco2 (Hou and Zou, 2005Hou F. Zou H. Two human orthologues of Eco1/Ctf7 acetyltransferases are both required for proper sister-chromatid cohesion.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3908-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In vertebrate cells, cohesin-DNA interactions are also regulated by Sororin. This protein was identified as a substrate of APC/CCdh1, a form of the APC/C that is active during mitotic exit and G1 phase, and Soronin was found to be essential for cohesion in mammalian cells (Rankin et al., 2005Rankin S. Ayad N.G. Kirschner M.W. Sororin, a substrate of the anaphase-promoting complex, is required for sister chromatid cohesion in vertebrates.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 185-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Sororin depletion also reduces the number of cohesin complexes that bind stably to DNA during G2 phase, indicating that Sororin is required for the formation of stable cohesin-DNA interactions (Schmitz et al., 2007Schmitz J. Watrin E. Lenart P. Mechtler K. Peters J.M. Sororin is required for stable binding of cohesin to chromatin and for sister chromatid cohesion in interphase.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 630-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown how Sororin performs this function, and whether the role of Sororin is related to the function of cohesin acetylation. Furthermore, it is unknown how widespread the role of Sororin is because Sororin has only been identified in vertebrates. Here we provide evidence that Sororin is recruited to chromatin-bound cohesin complexes in a manner that depends on DNA replication and Smc3 acetylation, that Sororin causes a conformational rearrangement within cohesin by displacing Wapl from Pds5, and that these molecular events stabilize cohesin on DNA by antagonizing Wapl's ability to dissociate cohesin from DNA. Furthermore, we show that distant orthologs of Sororin exist in many metazoan species, and that one of these proteins, Dalmatian, is required for cohesion in Drosophila. We therefore propose that sister chromatid cohesion depends on stabilization of cohesin on DNA by Sororin-related proteins. We had previously shown that Sororin is required for cohesion in G2 phase (Schmitz et al., 2007Schmitz J. Watrin E. Lenart P. Mechtler K. Peters J.M. Sororin is required for stable binding of cohesin to chromatin and for sister chromatid cohesion in interphase.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 630-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To address whether Sororin's function is already needed during S phase, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to deplete Sororin from HeLa cells that had been synchronized in the cell cycle and pulse-labeled these cells with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Cells in S phase were identified by immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) using BrdU antibodies, and the distance between sister chromatids was measured by DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a probe for an arm region on chromosome 21. On average, FISH signals were twice as far separated in BrdU-positive, Sororin-depleted cells than in control cells (Figures 1A and 1B ), indicating that Sororin is already required for cohesion during S phase. At variance with these results, it has been reported that Sororin-depleted cells only lose cohesion during metaphase and that Sororin is therefore not required for cohesion in early mitosis (Diaz-Martinez et al., 2007Diaz-Martinez L.A. Gimenez-Abian J.F. Clarke D.J. Regulation of centromeric cohesion by sororin independently of the APC/C.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, in time-lapse microscopy experiments we observed that most Sororin-depleted cells failed to congress chromosomes, consistent with the existence of cohesion defects before metaphase (Figures S1A–S1D available online). The function of Sororin is therefore not restricted to mitosis and is instead already needed during or shortly after DNA replication.Figure S1Sororin Is Required for Cohesion in S Phase, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A–D) Sororin is required for proper chromosome congression to the metaphase plate.

(M) Fractionation of chromatin-bound and soluble Sororin-LAP. Sororin-LAP cells were synchronized in late interphase by thymidine arrest-release (interphase) or in prometaphase by overnight nocodazole treatment (mitosis). Chromatin (chr) and soluble (sol) cell fractions were prepared, and equal numbers of cell equivalents were loaded for each fraction. Sororin-LAP was detected with a GFP antibody. As markers for fractionation, a subunit of the proteasome was immunoblotted, and histones were detected by Coomassie staining. We next analyzed the intracellular distribution of Sororin. Previous IFM and fractionation experiments had shown that Sororin associates with chromatin in interphase, but Sororin could not be detected on mitotic chromosomes (Rankin et al., 2005Rankin S. Ayad N.G. Kirschner M.W. Sororin, a substrate of the anaphase-promoting complex, is required for sister chromatid cohesion in vertebrates.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 185-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because our antibodies could not detect Sororin in IFM experiments, we tagged Sororin at its carboxy-terminus with a localization-affinity purification (LAP) tag that contains green fluorescent protein (GFP; Figure S1E). We modified the Sororin gene on a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), enabling gene expression from the endogenous promoter (Poser et al., 2008Poser I. Sarov M. Hutchins J.R. Heriche J.K. Toyoda Y. Pozniakovsky A. Weigl D. Nitzsche A. Hegemann B. Bird A.W. et al.BAC TransgeneOmics: a high-throughput method for exploration of protein function in mammals.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We used a mouse BAC for these experiments to enable RNAi “rescue” experiments and generated clonal HeLa cell lines that had stably integrated this BAC. The LAP-tagged version of mouse Sororin could substitute for the cohesion function of endogenous human Sororin when this was depleted by RNAi (Figures S1F and S1G), and in tandem affinity purification experiments mouse Sororin-LAP was found associated with human cohesin (Figures S1H and S1I), indicating that this tagged version of Sororin behaves similarly to endogenous Sororin. We therefore analyzed by IFM the intracellular distribution of Sororin-LAP, using antibodies to GFP. We stained proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Aurora B in the same cells as markers for S and G2 phases, respectively. Cellular Sororin-LAP levels were low in G1, accumulated between early S and G2 phases in the nucleus, and became dispersed in the cytoplasm following nuclear envelope breakdown (Figures S1J–S1L). When we analyzed cells from which soluble proteins had been extracted before fixation, we observed that Sororin-LAP accumulated on chromatin between early S phase and G2 phase, whereas most Sororin-LAP disappeared from chromosomes in prophase (Figures 1C–1E). At this stage, the cellular levels of Sororin were still high (Figure S1L), indicating that the removal of Sororin from prophase chromosomes is caused by dissociation, not degradation. Biochemical fractionation experiments confirmed this notion (Figure S1M). Importantly, however, small amounts of Sororin-LAP could still be detected by IFM on chromosomes in prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase, but not in anaphase or telophase (Figure 1E). Like cohesin (Waizenegger et al., 2000Waizenegger I.C. Hauf S. Meinke A. Peters J.M. Two distinct pathways remove mammalian cohesin from chromosome arms in prophase and from centromeres in anaphase.Cell. 2000; 103: 399-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), Sororin-LAP was enriched at centromeres in prometa/metaphase (Figure 1F). Sororin therefore associates with chromatin from S phase until metaphase, i.e., as long as cohesion exists. Because Sororin binds to cohesin and, like cohesin, is removed from mitotic chromosomes in two steps, during prophase and at the metaphase-anaphase transition, we tested whether the association of Sororin with chromatin depends on cohesin. Scc1 depletion reduced the intensity of Sororin-LAP staining on chromatin without affecting the cellular levels of Sororin-LAP (Figures 2A–2D ), indicating that Sororin can only efficiently associate with chromatin in the presence of cohesin. Biochemical experiments in Xenopus egg extracts confirmed this notion (see Figure 2F below). The presence of Sororin on mitotic chromosomes also depends on cohesin, as depletion of either Scc1 or Shugoshin-like 1 (Sgo1) reduced chromosomal Sororin-LAP staining, whereas depletion of Wapl or inhibition of Plk1 increased the amounts of Sororin on chromosome arms (Figure S2A ).Figure S2The Association of Sororin with Chromatin Depends on Cohesin and DNA Replication, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Sororin-LAP localization in mitosis.

However, in the real world, this may not always be so neatly arranged. Matyas et al. (p. 1240 ) have found that sensory and motor fields are specialized for different types of movement, such that in mice the motor cortex controlled the forward movement (protraction) of their whiskers and the sensory cortex controlled backwards movements (retraction) of whiskers. So if a whisker hits an object, then a reasonable first reaction might be a motor command for retraction. Similarly, the motor cortex stimulates protraction for more active exploration. Hence, the sensory cortex is also motor and the motor cortex is also sensory. In an ecological context, these combined reactions offer a repertoire useful for a mouse seeking food and shelter in a complex environment."

However, progress in the field has been hampered by the limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms governing the unique properties of aNSCs as the source of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain. Global molecular analysis of this important cell type was not yet possible because aNSCs could not be prospectively isolated. So far, aNSCs are enriched as neurospheres in vitro (Reynolds et al., 1992Reynolds B.A. Tetzlaff W. Weiss S.

However, neurosphere cells expanded in high concentrations of EGF and FGF2 differ profoundly from their in vivo counterparts, in regard to their fast proliferation (aNSCs in vivo proliferate slowly), their predominant generation of glial cells (aNSCs in vivo generate mostly neurons), and their expression of key fate determinants (Gabay et al., 2003Gabay L.

To gain access to acutely isolated aNSCs, various attempts have been used to enrich this population by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), but purification was either below 35% (Basak and Taylor, 2007Basak O.

To overcome these limitations, we aimed to improve the prospective isolation of aNSCs by utilizing the knowledge about their glial identity and ciliated nature (Chojnacki et al., 2009Chojnacki A.K.

Cells expressing GFAP and GLAST are the source of adult neurogenesis; they are able to self-renew in vivo (Ninkovic et al., 2007Ninkovic J. Mori T. Götz M. Distinct modes of neuron addition in adult mouse neurogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10906-10911Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and give rise to multipotent neurospheres in vitro (Garcia et al., 2004Garcia A.D. Doan N.B. Imura T. Bush T.G. Sofroniew M.V. GFAP-expressing progenitors are the principal source of constitutive neurogenesis in adult mouse forebrain.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed that these cells possess a radial glial-like morphology, are partially embedded within the ependymal layer, and possess a cilium (Mirzadeh et al., 2008Mirzadeh Z. Merkle F.T. Soriano-Navarro M. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A.

Neurosci. 2009; 10: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Conversely, multiciliated ependymal cells have been found to be largely quiescent and rarely form self-renewing neurospheres (Capela and Temple, 2002Capela A. Temple S.

However, the delineation between radial glia, tanycytes, and other ependymal cells is rather difficult (Chojnacki et al., 2009Chojnacki A.K. Mak G.K. Weiss S. Identity crisis for adult periventricular neural stem cells: Subventricular zone astrocytes, ependymal cells or both?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) because it relies on a few markers that are in fact nonexclusive, such as the Ca-binding protein S100β, which is often used to identify ependymal cells (Coskun et al., 2008Coskun V. Wu H. Blanchi B. Tsao S. Kim K. Zhao J. Biancotti J.C. Hutnick L. Krueger Jr., R.C. Fan G. et al.CD133+ neural stem cells in the ependyma of mammalian postnatal forebrain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) but is also present in astrocytes (see Figure S1 available online; Buffo et al., 2008Buffo A. Rite I. Tripathi P. Lepier A. Colak D. Horn A.P. Mori T. Götz M. Origin and progeny of reactive gliosis: A source of multipotent cells in the injured brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). For the same reason, discrimination between radial glia-like stem cells and other niche astrocytes was so far not possible. To overcome the limitation of single markers to define a distinct neural cell type, we followed a new dual-labeling strategy, which allowed us to reliably discriminate between aNSCs, niche astrocytes, and ependymal cells and thereby purify these cells for transcriptome analysis. We hypothesized that aNSCs may be identified and sorted by GFP driven by the GFAP promoter (hGFAP-GFP mice) (Nolte et al., 2001Nolte C. Matyash M. Pivneva T. Schipke C.G. Ohlemeyer C.

Mader M.T. Irmler M. Gentilini M. Santoni F. Drechsel D. Blum R. Stahl R. Bulfone A.

Prominin, a novel microvilli-specific polytopic membrane protein of the apical surface of epithelial cells, is targeted to plasmalemmal protrusions of non-epithelial cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 12425-12430Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In adult hGFAP-GFP mouse brains, all GFP-labeled cells in the diencephalon are colocalizing with astroglial markers like GFAP and S100β (Figures S1A and S1F). In the SEZ, most of the GFP+ cells were located beneath the layer of ependymal cells and were immunoreactive for GFAP (Figures S1A–S1A″, arrow). We also noticed that some weakly GFP+ cells were neuroblasts as revealed by double labeling with doublecortin (DCX) (about 20%; see Figures S1C–S1C″′). Analyzing for prominin1 immunoreactivity, we found that most of the GFP-expressing cells were not immunoreactive for prominin1 (Figures 1A–1A ″, arrowheads; hereinafter called hGFAP-GFP+only cells). Interestingly, we observed some GFP-labeled processes intercalating into the ependymal layer (arrow in Figure 1A′) in a characteristic pinwheel-like organization (Figures 1B–1B″; Movie S1). These cells never expressed DCX and the apical processes often bore a single acetylated tubulin-positive cilium showing prominin1 immunoreactivity especially at its tip (Figures 1C–1C″′, large arrow), whereas the basal processes were often in contact with blood vessels. Notably, these cells expressing both GFP and prominin1 (referred to as hGFAP-GFP+/prominin1+) were few in number, whereas the majority of prominin1-immunopositive cells lining the ventricle were multiciliated and GFP negative (Figures 1A and 1C), thereby resembling ependymal cells (Coskun et al., 2008Coskun V. Wu H. Blanchi B. Tsao S. Kim K. Zhao J. Biancotti J.C. Hutnick L. Krueger Jr., R.C. Fan G. et al.CD133+ neural stem cells in the ependyma of mammalian postnatal forebrain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neural stem cells confer unique pinwheel architecture to the ventricular surface in neurogenic regions of the adult brain.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 265-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Moreover, these prominin1+/GFP− cells (hereinafter called prominin1+only cells) expressed commonly used ependymal markers like S100β and Wdr16. However, these proteins were also expressed in other SEZ cell types as well as in parenchymal astrocytes (Figures S1D–S1F), illustrating the difficulty of distinguishing ependymal cells, aNSCs, and astrocytes by immunohistochemical “markers.” Consistent with this, we also observed weak expression of GFAP in multiciliated prominin1+only ependymal cells (Figures S1B–S1B″; see also Platel et al., 2009Platel J.C. Gordon V. Heintz T. Bordey A. GFAP-GFP neural progenitors are antigenically homogeneous and anchored in their enclosed mosaic niche.Glia. 2009; 57: 66-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These results suggest that cells with radial glia characteristics integrating partially into the ependymal layer can be detected by combined expression of hGFAP-GFP and prominin1. To further examine whether the double-positive cells possess the hallmarks of aNSCs, we first examined whether they are slow dividing and hence retain S-phase DNA label (such as BrdU) as previously described for aNSCs (Doetsch et al., 1999Doetsch F. Caillé I. Lim D.A. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A. Subventricular zone astrocytes are neural stem cells in the adult mammalian brain.Cell. 1999; 97: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3098) Google Scholar). Among the BrdU-label-retaining cells (BrdU for 2 weeks, followed by a 3 week BrdU-free “chase” period, n = 112), 70% ± 2% were hGFAP-GFP+/prominin1+ and these cells also exhibited the characteristic radial glia morphology integrated into the ependymal layer (Figures 2A–2B ″′, arrowheads indicate radial glial process and arrows prominin1+ cilia), demonstrating that this double-positive population is indeed slow dividing in vivo. Functionally, a key characteristic of aNSCs is their neurogenic nature. To examine whether the hGFAP-GFP+/prominin1+ cells contribute to adult neurogenesis, we took advantage of a recently developed fate mapping technique to follow exclusively the progeny of cells coexpressing two markers (“split-Cre”) (Hirrlinger et al., 2009Hirrlinger J. Scheller A. Hirrlinger P.G. Kellert B. Tang W. Wehr M.C. Goebbels S. Reichenbach A. Sprengel R. Rossner M.J. Kirchhoff F. Split-cre complementation indicates coincident activity of different genes in vivo.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This has been achieved by splitting the Cre-recombinase into two fragments and fusing them to the dimerizing GCN4-coiled coil domain yielding the N-terminal NCre and the C-terminal CCre fragment (Figure 2C). Because two different promoters control the expression of the two Cre fragments, only cells coexpressing the two markers have functional Cre-recombinase, and will therefore undergo the genomic recombination and permanently express the reporter gene (Hirrlinger et al., 2009Hirrlinger J. Scheller A. Hirrlinger P.G. Kellert B. Tang W. Wehr M.C. Goebbels S. Reichenbach A. Sprengel R. Rossner M.J. Kirchhoff F. Split-cre complementation indicates coincident activity of different genes in vivo.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We adapted this system to label GFP+/prominin1+ cells by cloning CCre behind the P2 element of the human prominin1 promoter (hP2-CCre) (Coskun et al., 2008Coskun V. Wu H. Blanchi B. Tsao S. Kim K. Zhao J. Biancotti J.C. Hutnick L. Krueger Jr., R.C. Fan G. et al.CD133+ neural stem cells in the ependyma of mammalian postnatal forebrain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and NCre behind the human GFAP promoter (hGFAP-NCre) into a FUGW lentiviral backbone (Lois et al., 2002Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Germline transmission and tissue-specific expression of transgenes delivered by lentiviral vectors.Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar) to achieve expression of functional CCre::NCre dimers only in cells expressing from both promoters hGFAP and P2. We first tested the lack of recombination mediated by each of the Cre fragments alone and observed no GFP reporter+ cells (Nakamura et al., 2006Nakamura T. Kurokawa K. Kiyokawa E. Matsuda M. Analysis of the spatiotemporal activation of rho GTPases using Raichu probes.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 315-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in neurospheres transduced with either construct (Figures S2B, S2C, S2E, and S2F), whereas successful recombination and many GFP reporter+ cells were detected upon cotransduction with both N- and C-terminal fragments driven by the hGFAP or P2 promoter in neurosphere cultures (Figures S2D and S2G). To examine these cells and their progeny in vivo, we injected lentiviruses expressing the two Cre fragments into the SEZ of reporter mice. Recombined GFP+ cells were observed already 3 dpi (days postinjection) in the SEZ (Figure 2J), but only when both viral vectors were coinjected. At 3 dpi, the majority of reporter+ cells (96%) were restricted to the SEZ and expressed GFAP (70%). Interestingly, some reporter-positive SEZ cells had radial glia morphology, consistent with previous suggestions of aNSCs having long radial processes (Figure 2D; Chojnacki et al., 2009Chojnacki A.K.

Although we observed more transit-amplifying cells (TAPs) than neuroblasts at short times after injection, the proportion of labeled neuroblasts increased in the SEZ (from 5% at 3 dpi to 30% at 10 dpi) (Figures 2E–2E″′) and extended into the rostral migratory stream (RMS) (Figures 2F–2F″), indicating that hGFAP-GFP+/prominin1+ cells indeed contribute to neurogenesis in vivo. To test the labeled cells for the ability to self-renew and generate neurons over a long period of time, we assessed the identity of labeled cells 3 months after injection of the split-Cre viral vectors. A small population of reporter-positive cells expressing GFAP (3%) was still present in the SEZ, indicating that they did not transform into a more differentiated cell type. Most importantly, these fate-mapped cells still gave rise to new neuroblasts, as shown by the fact that the majority (about 75%) of GFP+ cells in the SEZ and rostral migratory stream (RMS) expressed doublecortin (DCX) and migrated into the olfactory bulb (OB). These data suggest that there was ongoing neurogenesis from the labeled cells even 3 months after injection. By then many GFP reporter-positive cells were also found in the OB (73% of all reporter-positive cells) and most of them were mature (NeuN-positive, 45%) or immature (DCX-positive, 55%) neurons (Figures 2G–2H″). Notably, labeled cells populated both glomerular and granular cell layers (Figure 2I), suggesting that hGFAP and prominin1 promoter activities do not mark a specific, lineage-restricted population of neural stem cells, but rather a heterogeneous population capable of generating different subpopulations of the OB interneurons. Notably, the long-term neurogenesis of these cells also rules out any reaction to the injection of the virus that has long ceased by this time. Taken together, the fate mapping analysis reveals the stem cell hallmarks of the GFAP- and prominin1-coexpressing cells and also provides an ideal tool that can be combined with any LoxP-flanked genes for conditional gene targeting selectively in the stem cell lineage with minimal effects on other niche cells. Given that hGFAP-GFP+/prominin1+ cells exhibit features previously ascribed to aNSCs in vivo, we then proceeded to isolate them by FACS and examined whether this fraction would generate multipotent, self-renewing neurospheres. Toward this end, the SEZ tissue along the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle (Figure 3A ) was dissected from 8-week-old hGFAP-GFP mice, dissociated into single cells, and stained with prominin1 antibodies coupled to PE. FACS analysis (Figures 3B–3E) was performed by setting the gates with negative control cells, either from wild-type mice not expressing GFP or stained with isotype controls (Figure 3B). Among live SEZ cells (dead cells were excluded by PI staining) from hGFAP-GFP mice, 20% were GFP+ and 9% were prominin1 labeled (Figure 3C; for further details see Figure S3). Consistent with the observations in whole mounts and sections, we observed a small population of hGFAP-GFP+/prominin1+ cells (2.5%; Figure 3C). Importantly, when cells were dissociated from the brain parenchyma at some distance from any neurogenic site, such as the diencephalon (Figure 3A), no hGFAP-GFP+/prominin1+ cells could be detected, suggesting that this population is indeed different from the parenchymal astrocyte population (Figures 3D and 3E). Next we sorted the above described populations by FACS at the single cell mode with <2000 events/s. Resorting of the sorted cells showed 93% purity (Figure S3J), and immunocytochemical analysis of cells plated immediately after FACS confirmed their expected identities (Figure S4). For example, proteins known to be enriched in astrocytes such as GFAP, GLAST, and GLT-1 were detected in most of the hGFAP-GFP+ cells sorted from the diencephalon (96%) or the SEZ (85%–90%) as well as in most of the hGFAP-GFP+/prominin1+ stem cell population (78%). Conversely, the latter as well as the astrocytes from the diencephalon did not contain any neuroblasts (DCX+ cells) nor transient amplifying cells (TAPs) detected by Mash1 immunostaining and were hence pure glial cells. In contrast, the hGFAP-GFP+only cells sorted from the SEZ also contained some neuroblasts and TAPs (16% and 3%, respectively; see Figure S4U). Most of the cells sorted for their prominin1 positivity (but not for GFP) contained proteins expressed in ependymal cells, such as S100β as well as the cilia protein acetylated tubulin (89% and 90%, respectively; data not shown). However, astrocytes also show partially weaker immunoreactivity for these proteins, although at much lower levels (33% of hGFAP-GFP+only cells from the SEZ; 82% of hGFAP-GFP+ cells from the diencephalon; see Figure S1). This further supports the coexpression of many of the so-called marker proteins in both astrocyte and ependymal cell populations. Importantly, the prominin1-only cells were also purely ependymoglial cells and did not contain any neuroblasts or TAPs. To examine which of these populations would give rise to self-renewing, multipotent neurospheres, single cells of each sorted cell population were plated in single wells to ensure clonality of the spheres (Buffo et al., 2008Buffo A. Rite I. Tripathi P. Lepier A. Colak D. Horn A.P. Mori T. Götz M. Origin and progeny of reactive gliosis: A source of multipotent cells in the injured brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) and the number of neurospheres (defined as cell clusters exceeding 50 μm in diameter, i.e., containing at least 10–15 cells) was quantified 7–10 days after plating. Sorted cells negative for the markers (hGFAP-GFP, prominin1) did not generate any neurospheres (Figure 3F). Cells positive only for prominin1 generated very few neurospheres (9%; Figure 3F), consistent with previous work (Capela and Temple, 2002Capela A. Temple S.

USA. 2008; 105: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Remarkably, 72% of the hGFAP-GFP+/prominin1+ cells formed neurospheres, consistent with the aNSC hallmarks of the double-positive cells in vivo. Some neurospheres were also generated by hGFAP-GFP+only cells (Figure 3F). Because neurosphere formation by itself can not be used as reliable indication of multipotency and self-renewal (Buffo et al., 2008Buffo A. Rite I. Tripathi P. Lepier A. Colak D. Horn A.P. Mori T. Götz M. Origin and progeny of reactive gliosis: A source of multipotent cells in the injured brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), we first examined multipotency by culturing the primary neurospheres adherent and in the absence of mitogens (5–7 days), followed by staining for the neuron-specific protein βIII-tubulin or O4 and GFAP detecting glia. Notably, neurospheres of cells sorted for prominin1+only generated exclusively glial cells and hence were not multipotent (data not shown). Conversely, most neurospheres (79%, n = 28) derived from hGFAP-GFP+/prominin1+ cells gave rise to all three cell types (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons), indicating their multipotent nature (Figures 3G–3I). Neurospheres derived from the hGFAP-GFP+only cell fraction also gave rise to all three cell types (48%, n = 35). To examine self-renewal, primary neurospheres were individually transferred into separate wells, dissociated into single cells, and cultured for 7 days. Strikingly, none of the neurospheres formed by cells sorted for prominin1+only or hGFAP-GFP+only could be passaged and formed secondary neurospheres (Figure 3F; n = 60 and 100). Thus, none of these populations contained any self-renewing stem cells. Conversely, the neurospheres sorted for both GFP+ and prominin1+ were self-renewing (59%, n = 90; Figure 3F) and could further self-renew for more than six passages (data not shown). Thus, our dual-labeling protocol combining GFP expression from the human GFAP promoter and prominin1 expression resulted in an enrichment of multipotent, self-renewing neural stem cells above 70%, and additionally this fraction also comprised all SEZ stem cells, as none of the other cell populations formed self-renewing, multipotent neurospheres. This, together with the in vivo data, further corroborates the stem cell hallmarks of the hGFAP-GFP/prominin1 double-positive cells and their considerable enrichment by FACS. Notably, the hGFAP-GFP+only SEZ cells lacking prominin1 were composed predominantly of astrocytes (85%–90%) that lacked neurosphere-forming capacity, suggesting that this astrocyte population in the SEZ is functionally different and rather corresponds to niche astrocytes. Thus our approach allowed us to separate aNSCs from other astrocytes in and outside of the SEZ. These highly enriched aNSCs (hGFAP-GFP+/prominin1+ cells) were then examined by whole-genome Affymetrix MOE430 2.0 arrays. Their transcriptome was compared to the transcriptome of parenchymal astrocytes that are not neurogenic (hGFAP-GFP+ cells from the diencephalon), as well as to other cell types in the SEZ, such as the multiciliated ependymal cells (SEZ prominin1+only) and the SEZ hGFAP-GFP+only cells comprising niche astrocytes and some of the stem cell progeny. Hierarchical clustering of the expression data from all biological replicates grouped the samples according to their cellular identity, indicating high reproducibility of the sortings and the RNA amplification protocol (Figure 4A ). Interestingly, rather than the two astroglial populations clustering with each other (the aNSCs and the diencephalic astrocytes), the promini"

B2AR is sorted into a specialized subset of tubules in the endosome and recycled A highly localized actin-based machinery stabilizes this subset of tubular domains This allows selective sequence-dependent entry of B2AR by regulated diffusion Actin binding via PDZ domains concentrates B2AR in these recycling domains Cells constantly internalize a large fraction of proteins from their surface and the extracellular environment. The fates of these internalized proteins in the endosome have a direct impact on several critical functions of the cell, including its response to environmental signals (Lefkowitz et al., 1998Lefkowitz R.J.

Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Internalized proteins have three main fates in the endosome. First, many membrane proteins, such as the transferrin receptor (TfR), are sorted away from soluble proteins, largely by bulk membrane flow back to the cell surface. This occurs via the formation and fission of narrow tubules that have a high ratio of membrane surface area (and therefore membrane proteins) to volume (soluble contents) (Mayor et al., 1993Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. Sorting of membrane components from endosomes and subsequent recycling to the cell surface occurs by a bulk flow process.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Several proteins have been implicated in the formation of these tubules (Shinozaki-Narikawa et al., 2006Shinozaki-Narikawa N. Kodama T. Shibasaki Y.

Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Second, many membrane proteins are transported to the lysosome to be degraded. This involves a process called involution, where proteins are packaged into vesicles that bud off to the interior of the endosome and, in essence, converts these proteins into being a part of the soluble contents (Piper and Katzmann, 2007Piper R.C. Katzmann D.J. Biogenesis and function of multivesicular bodies.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 519-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Involution has also been studied extensively, and the machinery responsible, termed ESCRT complex, identified (Hurley, 2008Hurley J.H.

Third, several other membrane proteins, such as many signaling receptors, escape the bulk recycling and degradation pathways, and are instead recycled in a regulated manner (Hanyaloglu and von Zastrow, 2008Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. Regulation of GPCRs by endocytic membrane trafficking and its potential implications.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Cargo-mediated regulation of a rapid Rab4-dependent recycling pathway.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This requires a specific cis-acting sorting sequence present on the receptor's cytoplasmic surface (Cao et al., 1999Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. A kinase-regulated PDZ-domain interaction controls endocytic sorting of the β2-adrenergic receptor.Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, Hanyaloglu and von Zastrow, 2008Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. Regulation of GPCRs by endocytic membrane trafficking and its potential implications.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 537-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). How receptors use these sequences to escape the involution pathway and recycle, though they are excluded from the default recycling pathway (Maxfield and McGraw, 2004Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Endocytic recycling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, Hanyaloglu et al., 2005Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. Essential role of Hrs in a recycling mechanism mediating functional resensitization of cell signaling.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), is a fundamental cell biological question that is still unanswered. Although it is clear that different recycling cargo can travel through discrete endosomal populations (Maxfield and McGraw, 2004Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Endocytic recycling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling from a single endosome is generally thought to occur via a uniform population of tubules. Contrary to this traditional view, we identify specialized endosomal tubular domains mediating sequence-dependent recycling that are kinetically and biochemically distinct from the domains that mediate bulk recycling. These domains are stabilized by a local actin cytoskeleton that is required and sufficient for receptor recycling. We propose that such specialized actin-stabilized domains provide the physical basis for overcoming a kinetic barrier for receptor entry into endosomal tubules and for affinity-based concentration of proteins in the sequence-dependent recycling pathway. The beta 2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR) and the delta opioid receptor (DOR) provide excellent models for physiologically relevant proteins that are sorted from each other in the endosome. Although they share endocytic pathways, B2AR is recycled efficiently in a sequence-dependent manner while DOR is selectively degraded in the lysosome (Cao et al., 1999Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. A kinase-regulated PDZ-domain interaction controls endocytic sorting of the β2-adrenergic receptor.Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, Whistler et al., 2002Whistler J.L.

Modulation of postendocytic sorting of G protein-coupled receptors.Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To study the endosomal sorting of these cargo molecules, we started by testing whether tubulation was involved in this process. Because such sorting has not been observed in vivo, we first attempted to visualize the dynamics of receptor sorting in live HEK293 cells expressing fluorescently labeled B2AR or DOR receptors, using high-resolution confocal microscopy. Both receptors were observed mostly on the cell surface before isoproterenol or DADLE, their respective agonists, were added. After agonist addition, both B2AR (Figure 1A ) and DOR (data not shown) were robustly internalized, and appeared in endosomes within 5 min (Figure 1A and Movie S1 available online). As a control, receptors did not internalize in cells not treated with agonists, but imaged for the same period of time (Figure S1A). The B2AR-containing endosomes colocalized with the early endosome markers Rab5 (Figure S1B) and EEA1 (data not shown), consistent with previous data.Figure S1Related to Figure 1 and Figure 2Show full caption(A) Cells not exposed to agonist do not show internalization over the imaging timeframe.

B2AR-expressing cells were transfected with Rab5Q79L-GFP (A), Rab 4-GFP (B), or Rab 11-GFP (C) and imaged 72 hr later after exposure to isoproterenol. Colocalization of the receptor with the three Rab proteins is readily apparent in a few minutes after agonist-treatment. Internalized B2AR (Figure 1B), but not DOR (Figure 1C), also labeled tubules that extended from the main body of the receptor. When receptor fluorescence was quantified across multiple B2AR-containing tubules, we saw that receptors were enriched in these tubules compared to the rest of the endosomal limiting membrane (Figure 1D). The bulk recycling protein TfR, in contrast, was not enriched in endosomal tubules (Figure 1D). This suggests that sequence-dependent recycling receptors are enriched by an active mechanism in these endosomal tubules. These endosomal tubules were preferentially enriched for B2AR over DOR on the same endosome. In cells coexpressing FLAG-tagged B2AR and GFP-tagged DOR, we observed endosomes that contained both receptors within 5 min after coapplying isoproterenol and DADLE. Notably, these endosomes extruded tubules that contained B2AR but not detectable DOR (e.g., in Figure 1E and in Movie S2). Fluorescence traces across the endosome and the tubule confirmed that DOR was not detectable in these B2AR tubules, suggesting that B2AR was specifically sorted into these tubular domains (e.g., in Figure 1F). When linear pixel values from multiple sorting events were quantified, B2AR was enriched ∼50% in the endosomal domains from which tubules originate, compared to the endosomal membrane outside these domains (Figure 1G). Thus, these experiments resolve, for the first time, individual events that mediate sorting of two signaling receptors in the endosomes of live cells. To test whether these tubules mediated recycling of B2AR, we visualized direct delivery of receptors from these tubules to the cell surface. In endosomes containing internalized B2AR and DOR, these tubular domains pinched off vesicles that contained B2AR but not detectable levels of DOR (Figure 2A and Movie S3). To reliably assess if these vesicles traveled to the surface and fused with the plasma membrane, we combined our current imaging with a method that we have used previously to visualize individual vesicle fusion events mediating surface receptor delivery (Yudowski et al., 2006Yudowski G.A. Puthenveedu M.A. von Zastrow M. Distinct modes of regulated receptor insertion to the somatodendritic plasma membrane.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, we attached the pH-sensitive GFP variant superecliptic pHluorin to the extracellular domain of B2AR (SpH-B2AR) (Miesenböck et al., 1998Miesenböck G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Visualizing secretion and synaptic transmission with pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins.Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). SpH-B2AR is highly fluorescent when exposed to the neutral pH at the cell surface, but is quenched in the acidic environments of endosomes and intracellular vesicles. This allows the detection of individual fusion events of vesicles containing B2AR at the cell surface (Yudowski et al., 2009Yudowski G.A. Puthenveedu M.A. Henry A.G. von Zastrow M. Cargo-mediated regulation of a rapid Rab4-dependent recycling pathway.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In cells coexpressing SpH-B2AR and B2AR labeled with a pH-insensitive fluorescent dye (Alexa-555), vesicles derived from the endosomal tubules trafficked to the cell surface and fused, as seen by a sudden increase in SpH fluorescence followed by loss of fluorescence due to diffusion (Figure 2B, and Movie S4). A fluorescence trace from movie S4 confirmed the fusion and loss of B2AR fluorescence (Figure 2C). Also, Rab4 and Rab11, which function in endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling (Zerial and McBride, 2001Zerial M. McBride H. Rab proteins as membrane organizers.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar, Maxfield and McGraw, 2004Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Endocytic recycling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), were localized to the domains containing B2AR (Figure S1). Together, this indicates that the B2AR-containing endosomal tubules mediate delivery of B2AR to the cell surface. We next examined whether the B2AR-containing microdomains were biochemically distinct from the rest of the endosomal membrane. We first focused on actin, as the actin cytoskeleton is required for efficient recycling of B2AR but not of TfR (Cao et al., 1999Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M.

Strikingly, in cells coexpressing B2AR and actin-GFP, actin was concentrated on the endosome specifically on the tubular domains containing B2AR (Figure 3A ). Virtually every B2AR tubule observed showed this specific actin concentration on the tubule (n = 350). As with actin, coronin-GFP (Uetrecht and Bear, 2006Uetrecht A.C. Bear J.E. Coronins: the return of the crown.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 421-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), an F-actin binding protein, also localized specifically to the B2AR-containing tubules on endosomes (Figure 3B), confirming that this was a polymerized actin cytoskeleton. Coronin was also observed on the B2AR-containing vesicle that was generated by dynamic scission of the B2AR tubule (Figure 3B and Movie S5). Fluorescence traces of the linear pixels across the tubule and the vesicle confirmed that coronin pinched off with the B2AR vesicle (Figure 3C). We also used two separate techniques to characterize actin localization on these tubules beyond the ∼250 nm resolution offered by conventional microscopy. First, we first imaged the localization of coronin on endosomes containing B2AR tubules using structured illumination microscopy (Gustafsson et al., 2008Gustafsson M.G. Shao L. Carlton P.M. Wang C.J. Golubovskaya I.N. Cande W.Z. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Three-dimensional resolution doubling in wide-field fluorescence microscopy by structured illumination.Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 4957-4970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), which resolves structures at ∼100 nm spatial resolution. 3D stacks obtained using this high-resolution technique confirmed that coronin was specifically localized on the endosomal tubule that contained B2AR (Figure 3D and Movie S6). Second, we examined the morphology of actin on endosomal tubules at the ultrastructural level by pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy. Actin was clearly labeled as filaments lying along tubules extruded from endosomal structures (Figure 3E). We then tested whether the actin filaments on these tubules were a stable structure or were dynamically turned over. When cells expressing actin-GFP were exposed to latrunculin, a drug that prevents actin polymerization, endosomal actin fluorescence became indistinguishable from the “background” cytoplasmic fluorescence within 16–18 s after drug exposure (e.g., in Figure 4A ). When quantified across multiple cells, endosomal actin fluorescence showed an exponential loss after latrunculin exposure, with a t1/2 of 3.5 s (99% Confidence Interval = 3.0 to 4.1 s) (Figure 4B), indicating that endosomal actin turned over quite rapidly. As a control, stress fibers, which are composed of relatively stable capped actin filaments, were turned over more slowly in these same cells (e.g., in Figure S2A ). Endosomal actin was lost in >98% of cells within 30 s after latrunculin, in contrast to stress fibers, which persisted for over 2 min in >98% of cells (Figure S2B). Rapid turnover of endosomal actin was also independently confirmed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies. When a single endosomal actin spot was bleached, the fluorescence recovered rapidly within 20 s (Figure 4C). As a control for more stable actin filaments, stress fibers showed little recovery of fluorescence after bleaching in this interval (Figure 4C). Exponential curve fits yielding a t1/2 of 8.26 s (99% CI = 7.65 to 8.97 s), consistent with rapid actin turnover (Figure 4D). In contrast, only part of the fluorescence (∼30%) was recovered in stress fibers in the same cells by 20 s, with curve fits yielding a t1/2 of 50.35 s (99% CI = 46.05 to 55.54 s). These results indicate that actin is dynamically assembled on the B2AR recycling tubules.Figure S2Actin on Endosomes Is More Rapidly Turned over Than in Stress Fibers, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Confocal section at two different planes showing endosomal actin and stress fibers in the same cell over time after latrunculin.

Considering the rapid turnover of actin, we next explored the machinery responsible for localizing actin at the tubule. The Arp2/3 complex is a major nucleator of dynamic actin polymerization that has been implicated in polymerization-based endosome motility (Stamnes, 2002Stamnes M. Regulating the actin cytoskeleton during vesicular transport.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, Girao et al., 2008Girao H. Geli M.I. Idrissi F.Z.

Regulation of actin filament assembly by Arp2/3 complex and formins.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2007; 36: 451-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Arp3, an integral part of the Arp2/3 complex useful for visualizing this complex in intact cells (Merrifield et al., 2004Merrifield C.J. Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Almers W. Neural Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (N-WASP) and the Arp2/3 complex are recruited to sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in cultured fibroblasts.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), was specifically concentrated at the base of the B2AR tubules on the endosome (e.g., in Figure 4E and fluorescence trace in Figure 4F, Movie S7). Every B2AR tubule observed had a corresponding Arp3 spot at its base (n = 200). Surprisingly, however, we did not see N-WASP and WAVE-2, canonical members of the two main families of Arp2/3 activators (Millard et al., 2004Millard T.H. Sharp S.J. Machesky L.M. Signalling to actin assembly via the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein)-family proteins and the Arp2/3 complex.Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), on the endosome (Figure 4G). Similarly, we did not see endosomal recruitment of activated Cdc42, as assessed by a previously characterized GFP-fusion reporter consisting of the GTPase binding domain of N-WASP (Benink and Bement, 2005Benink H.A. Bement W.M. Concentric zones of active RhoA and Cdc42 around single cell wounds.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) (data not shown). All three proteins were readily detected at lamellipodia and filopodia as expected, indicating that the proteins were functional in these cells. While we cannot rule out a weak or transitory interaction of these activators with Arp2/3 at the endosome, the lack of enrichment prompted us to test for alternate Arp2/3 activators. Cortactin, an Arp- and actin- binding protein present on endosomes, has been proposed to be such an activator (Kaksonen et al., 2000Kaksonen M. Peng H.B. Rauvala H.

J. 2004; 382: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Cortactin-GFP was clearly concentrated at the base of the B2AR tubule on the endosome (Figure 4G), in a pattern identical to Arp2/3. When quantified (>200 endosomes each), every B2AR tubule was marked by cortactin, while none of the endosomes showed detectable N-WASP, WAVE-2, or Cdc42. Similarly, the WASH protein complex, which has been recently implicated in trafficking from the endosome (Derivery et al., 2009Derivery E. Sousa C. Gautier J.J. Lombard B. Loew D. Gautreau A.

Welch M.D. WASH and the Arp2/3 complex regulate endosome shape and trafficking.Cytoskeleton (Hoboken). 2010; 67: 193-206PubMed Google Scholar), was also clearly localized to B2AR tubules (Figure 4G). Together, these data suggest that an Arp2/3-, cortactin- and WASH-based machinery mediates dynamic actin assembly on the endosome. Since the traditional view is that the endosomal tubules that mediate direct recycling to the plasma membrane are a uniform population, we next tested whether these tubules were the same as those that recycle bulk cargo. When B2AR recycling was visualized along with bulk recycling of TfR, endosomes containing both cargo typically extruded three to four tubules containing TfR. Strikingly, however, only one of these contained detectable amounts of B2AR (Example in Figure 5A , quantified in Figure 5B). This was consistent with fast 3D confocal live cell imaging of B2AR in endosomes, which showed that"

Using human embryonic stem cells directed toward mesendodermal differentiation, we show that mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) originate from a population of mesodermal cells identified by expression of apelin receptor. In semisolid medium, these precursors form FGF2-dependent compact spheroid colonies containing mesenchymal cells with a transcriptional profile representative of mesoderm-derived embryonic mesenchyme. When transferred to adherent cultures, individual colonies give rise to MSC lines with chondro-, osteo-, and adipogenic differentiation potentials. Although the MSC lines lacked endothelial potential, endothelial cells could be derived from the mesenchymal colonies, suggesting that, similar to hematopoietic cells, MSCs arise from precursors with angiogenic potential. Together, these studies identified a common precursor of mesenchymal and endothelial cells, mesenchymoangioblast, as the source of mesoderm-derived MSCs.

In addition, MSCs give rise to hematopoiesis-supportive stroma and contribute to the formation of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche (Blazsek et al., 2000Blazsek I. Chagraoui J. Péault B.

Although MSCs are widely used for cellular therapies and tissue engineering, their precursors remain largely unknown. Thus, there is a need to define developmentally distinct MSC subsets and the hierarchy of their progenitors to advance our understanding of heterogeneity within MSCs and its implications for the developmental and therapeutic potential of these cells. Studies in mouse embryo demonstrated the origin of MSCs from neural crest (Morikawa et al., 2009Morikawa S. Mabuchi Y. Niibe K. Suzuki S. Nagoshi N. Sunabori T. Shimmura S. Nagai Y. Nakagawa T.

Self-renewal capacity is a widespread property of various types of neural crest precursor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4495-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, Sox1+ neuroepithelial cells were identified as progenitors that give rise to MSCs through a neural crest intermediate stage (Takashima et al., 2007Takashima Y. Era T. Nakao K. Kondo S. Kasuga M. Smith A.G. Nishikawa S. Neuroepithelial cells supply an initial transient wave of MSC differentiation.Cell. 2007; 129: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Recently, the MSC potential of neural crest stem cells generated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) was shown (Lee et al., 2007Lee G. Kim H. Elkabetz Y. Al Shamy G. Panagiotakos G. Barberi T. Tabar V. Studer L. Isolation and directed differentiation of neural crest stem cells derived from human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1468-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The mesoderm is considered to be another and major source of mesenchymal cells giving rise to skeletal and connective tissues (Dennis and Charbord, 2002Dennis J.E. Charbord P. Origin and differentiation of human and murine stroma.Stem Cells. 2002; 20: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). An early Flk1+ mesodermal precursor, with the potential to differentiate into endothelial cells, blood, muscle, and mesenchymal lineage cells (bone and cartilage), was identified in the E9.5 mouse dorsal aorta (Minasi et al., 2002Minasi M.G. Riminucci M. De Angelis L. Borello U. Berarducci B. Innocenzi A. Caprioli A. Sirabella D. Baiocchi M. De Maria R. et al.The meso-angioblast: A multipotent, self-renewing cell that originates from the dorsal aorta and differentiates into most mesodermal tissues.Development. 2002; 129: 2773-2783PubMed Google Scholar). Evaluation of osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic potential of cells isolated from different anatomical sites in the E11 mouse embryos revealed itraembryonic hematopoietic tissues (aorta-gonad-mesonephros) as a site of origin for cells with mesenchymal differentiation potential (Mendes et al., 2005Mendes S.C. Robin C. Dzierzak E. Mesenchymal progenitor cells localize within hematopoietic sites throughout ontogeny.Development. 2005; 132: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, immediate mesodermal precursors that give rise to expandable multipotential MSC lines are not identified and characterized. To identify MSC precursors of mesodermal origin, we employed an hESC differentiation system that reproduces many aspects of early embryonic development and provides access to cells otherwise inaccessible in humans that represent the earliest stages of mesodermal commitment (Gadue et al., 2005Gadue P.

Mesenchymal “precursors” identified in these studies were isolated using typical MSC markers such as CD73 or CD105 and were defined as cells with osteo-, chondro-, and adipogenic potential (i.e., representing de facto MSCs rather than cells predetermined to MSC fate or true MSC precursors). Here, using hESCs directed to mesendodermal differentiation through coculture with OP9, we show that mesoderm-derived MSCs arise from a common endothelial and mesenchymal cell precursor, mesenchymoangioblast, a transient population of cells within APLNR+ mesodermal subset that can be identified using FGF2-dependent mesenchymal colony-forming cell (MS-CFC) assay in serum-free semisolid suspension culture. To identify human mesenchymal precursors of mesodermal origin, we employed hESC coculture with OP9, which is known as an efficient differentiation system for cells of mesodermal lineages, including hematopoietic, vascular, and cardiac cells (Nakano et al., 1994Nakano T.

Molecular profiling of OP9-depleted hESC-derived cells differentiated throughout days 1–7 demonstrated selective commitment toward mesodermal and endodermal lineages with no detectable ectoderm (tropho-, neuro-, or surface ectoderm; see Figure S1 available online). Kinetically, the T, MIXL1, and EOMES transcription factors involved in induction of mesendoderm were upregulated synchronously and peaked on day 2 of differentiation. This was followed by expression of mesoderm- and endoderm-specific genes and coincided with a maximal cell proliferation on day 3 of differentiation. This stage was also accompanied by sustained expression of SNAI1 and SNAI2 genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Among the mesodermal subsets, only genes representing lateral plate/extraembryonic mesoderm (FOXF1, HAND1, GATA2) were upregulated, whereas no substantial expression of axial (CHRD, SHH), paraxial/myogenic (MEOX1, TCF15, MYOD1, MYF5, PAX3, PAX7), or intermediate (PAX2, PAX8, OSR1) mesoderm genes was noticed. Following 4–5 days of differentiation, specification of endodermal and mesodermal lineages was observed. Because fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is involved in specification, migration, and patterning of mesoderm during embryonic development (Ciruna and Rossant, 2001Ciruna B. Rossant J. FGF signaling regulates mesoderm cell fate specification and morphogenetic movement at the primitive streak.Dev.

Commun. 2001; 288: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) and because of our observation that FGF2 selectively increased the mesenchymal subpopulation of hESC-derived CD34+ cells (Figure S2), we tested whether any hESC-derived cells with colony-forming mesenchymal potential could be detected in FGF2-supplemented semisolid media. In accordance with upregulation of genes marking mesodermal commitment on days 2–3 of hESC differentiation in coculture, we observed FGF2-dependent colony-forming activity when hESC-derived cells were plated in serum-free semisolid medium. Day 2 cells generated compact, sharply circumscribed spheroid colonies formed by tightly packed cells, whereas day 3 cells mostly produced disperse colonies with a morphology similar to the previously described blast (BL) or hemangioblast colonies (Figure 1A ), which are known derivatives of angiohematopoietic mesoderm (Choi et al., 1998Choi K.

Both colony types were generated at relatively high frequency, comprising up to 2%–3% of the total hESC-derived cells (Figure 1B). Similar to BL colonies (D'Souza et al., 2005D'Souza S.L. Elefanty A.G. Keller G. SCL/Tal-1 is essential for hematopoietic commitment of the hemangioblast but not for its development.Blood. 2005; 105: 3862-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), compact colonies were formed through establishment of tightly packed single-cell-derived structures (cores), which expand into spheroid colonies (Figure 1A and Movies S1–S3). Both compact and BL colony formation were solely dependent on the presence of FGF2, but not other tested factors (VEGF, SCF, IGF1, EGF, and HGF; Figure 1C and data not shown), and required serum-free medium. Although previous studies reported the VEGF dependence of BL colonies generated using embryoid body method (Kennedy et al., 2007Kennedy M. D'Souza S.L. Lynch-Kattman M. Schwantz S. Keller G.

A common precursor for primitive erythropoiesis and definitive haematopoiesis.Nature. 1997; 386: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), we could not detect any colonies when VEGF used alone and its addition to FGF2 had no significant effect on the number of BL colonies from hESCs differentiated on OP9. It is possible that this discrepancy could be attributed to the differences in differentiation systems, for example, a high level of autocrine VEGF production by hESCs differentiated on OP9 or the presence of inhibitors and/or modulators of VEGF signaling in embryoid body system. The formation of compact and BL colonies was completely abrogated by adding transforming growth factor β1 or activin A (1 ng/ml) to clonogenic cultures (Figure 1C) or in presence of serum. Although PDGF-BB alone lacked colony-forming activity, its addition to FGF2 significantly increased the frequency and size of compact colonies. In contrast, the addition of VEGF to FGF2 cultures essentially abrogated formation of compact colonies at the core stage (Figure 1C). It is important to notice that both types of colonies represent a transient population of cells that could not be detected beyond 4 days of differentiation when the first hematopoietic colonies arise (Figure 1B). Phenotypic analysis of fully developed spheroid colonies (day 12 of clonogenic culture) demonstrated that they consist of a uniform population of CD140a+CD90+CD56+CD166+CD31−CD43−CD45− cells, with the majority of cells expressing MSC and perivascular cell marker CD146 (Crisan et al., 2008Crisan M.

Thus, we designated these colonies as mesenchymal (MS) colonies, and we designated cells forming these colonies as MS-CFCs. It is noteworthy that cells within colonies expressed endomucin, endothelial tyrosine kinase (TEK or TIE2), and VEGFR1 (FLT1, Figures 2B and 2C), molecules typically associated with endothelial cells. Transcriptional profiling of MS and BL colonies clearly demonstrated that MS colonies were enriched in genes representative of embryonic mesenchyme originating from lateral plate/extraembryonic mesoderm (FOXF1, HAND1, NKX2-5, SNAI2, CDH11, RUNX2, SOX9), whereas BL colonies were enriched in genes signifying hematopoietic commitment (GATA1, NFE2, TAL1, SPI1, VAV1; Figure 2D). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of individual MS colonies revealed that essentially all colonies lacked expression of ESC (POU5F1, SOX2), neuroectoderm (SOX2), mesendoderm (T), and endoderm (FOXA2)-specific genes but showed a high expression of lateral plate/extraembryonic mesoderm-specific marker FOXF1 and genes essential for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (SNAI2) and bone and cartilage development (RUNX2, SOX9). However, expression of genes involved in adipogenesis (PPARG) and myogenesis (MYF5) was not detected (Figure 2E). Similar to hESCs, MS-CFCs were also generated from iPSCs, although we noted that MS colonies with typical morphology could be obtained only from transgene-free iPSCs. Lentivirally reprogrammed cells generated colonies with aberrant morphology, indicating that background expression of transgenes could affect the spatial organization of colonies (Figure S3A). As observed by time-lapse photography, MS colonies developed from single cells (Movie S1). To confirm single-cell origin using alternative assays, we prepared a chimeric hESC (H1) line containing equal proportions of randomly mixed EGFP- and mOrange-marked H1 hESCs and assayed it for MS-CFCs. By prediction, if colonies are derived from single cells, no mixed colonies should be observed. However, if at least two or more cells are required, half or more of the colonies should be mixed. When the MS-CFC assay was performed with a differentiated chimeric cell population, almost all of the MS colonies were single colored, either EGFP or mOrange positive. A minority of mixed colonies (<5%) was observed only in cultures with high cell-plating density. At the density of 104 cells/ml, all counted colonies (n = 189) were of a single color (Figure 3A ), thus demonstrating that MS colonies arise from single cells, but not from cell aggregates. As additional proof of clonality, we performed a single-cell deposition assay that revealed that singly deposited cells generated MS colonies with a frequency similar to bulk cultures (∼1%; Figure 3B). To elucidate the differentiation potential, we collected MS colonies and transferred them back onto OP9 for an additional four days of culture. As shown in Figure 4A , the majority of cells differentiated from compact colonies expressed CD146+CD31−CD43−CD45− MSC phenotype (Sacchetti et al., 2007Sacchetti B. Funari A. Michienzi S. Di Cesare S. Piersanti S. Saggio I. Tagliafico E. Ferrari S. Robey P.G. Riminucci M. Bianco P. Self-renewing osteoprogenitors in bone marrow sinusoids can organize a hematopoietic microenvironment.Cell. 2007; 131: 324-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). However, we also noticed a readily identifiable population of CD31+/CD144+CD43− endothelial cells comprising up to 7% of the total hESC-derived cells. When MS colonies were plated on Matrigel matrix, endothelial cells migrated out of colonies and organized into a network of typical vascular tubes (Figure 4C). The endothelial potential of MS colonies could be significantly enhanced with the addition of bone morphogenic protein 4 to colony-forming medium (BMP4; Figure 4D). Despite readily detectable endothelial differentiation, CD43+ (Vodyanik et al., 2006Vodyanik M.A. Thomson J.A. Slukvin I.I. Leukosialin (CD43) defines hematopoietic progenitors in human embryonic stem cell differentiation cultures.Blood. 2006; 108: 2095-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) or CD45+ hematopoietic cells were never detected in these cultures, even from colonies generated in presence of BMP4 (Figures 4A and 4D and Figure S4A). When individual compact spheroid colonies were transferred onto OP9, about 70% of the colonies generated CD144 (VE-cadherin)+ endothelial cells in addition to the mesenchymal cells identified by expression of calponin (Figure 4B). By contrast, BL colonies generated predominantly CD43+ hematopoietic cells with some CD31+/CD144+CD43− endothelial cells and CD146+CD31− mesenchymal cells (Figures 4A and 4B). Kinetic analysis of the angiogenic potential of MS colonies at different stages of maturation revealed that the formation of mesenchymoendothelial clusters was the most prominent from colonies collected on day 6 of clonogenic culture. Three-day-old (core stage) and 12-day-old (mature stage) colonies formed predominantly endothelial and mesenchymal clusters, respectively (Figures S4B and S4C). Based on specific morphology, differentiation potential, and contrasting VEGF response, we concluded that the compact spheroid colonies represent common precursor for mesenchymal and endothelial lineages distinct from the already-described BL-CFC (Choi et al., 1998Choi K.

A common precursor for hematopoietic and endothelial cells.Development. 1998; 125: 725-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Kennedy et al., 2007Kennedy M. D'Souza S.L. Lynch-Kattman M. Schwantz S.

A common precursor for primitive erythropoiesis and definitive haematopoiesis.Nature. 1997; 386: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). By analogy with hemangioblast, we designated this novel mesenchymal and endothelial precursor as mesenchymoangioblast. When individual MS colonies were plated on the collagen- and fibronectin-coated plastic, immediate attachment and vigorous outgrowth of fibroblast-like cells were observed (Figure 2A). Following expansion, cells grew intensively during the first 10 passages (doubling time [dT] = 18–23 hr), growth rate was attenuated at 10–15 passages (dT = 30–35 hr), and gradual senescence was observed during 15–25 passages (Figure 2F). Cultures derived from single MS-CFC accumulated up to 1022 total cells (Figure 2G). Assuming a single-cell origin of colonies, this number corresponds to the expansion potential of a single hESC-derived mesenchymal precursor. Although the cells composing the MS colonies were lacking CD73 and expressed CD105 weakly, colony-derived cell lines upregulated their expression, displayed CD146+CD73+CD105+CD31−CD43−CD45− phenotype, typical of adult bone marrow MSCs, and maintained normal karyotype (Figures 2B and 2C; Figure S3B). Generated MSC lines could be differentiated in the chondro-, osteo-, and adipogenic conditions, with triple potential detected in the majority of single colony-derived lines (Figure 5). This finding provides functional confirmation of the MSC nature of the colony-derived cell lines and proves MSC origin from mesenchymoangioblasts. Neither endothelial nor hematopoietic cells could be detected after coculture of MSC lines with OP9 cells (Figure 4E). The same was true in the feeder-free culture with hematoendothelial growth factors (VEGF, FGF2, SCF, TPO, IL3, IL6; data not shown), indicating the restricted differentiation potential of expanded MSCs. Demonstration of endothelial potential of MS colonies strongly indicates the mesodermal origin of MS-CFCs. However, neural crest origin of these cells could not be completely excluded, because the potential of neural crest cells to form corneal endothelium is recognized (Noden, 1978Noden D.M. The control of avian cephalic neural crest cytodifferentiation. I. Skeletal and connective tissues.Dev. Biol. 1978; 67: 296-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To more precisely define the source of mesenchymoangioblasts, we decided to identify a cell population enriched in MS-CFCs. Although VEGFR2 (Flk1 or KDR) and PDGFRα in mouse are well-defined markers of mesoderm with the potential to generate hematovascular and mural cells (Orr-Urtreger et al., 1992Orr-Urtreger A.

Protein phosphorylation and protein ubiquitination regulate most aspects of cell life, and defects in these control mechanisms cause cancer and many other diseases. In the past decade, protein kinases have become one of the most important classes of drug targets for the pharmaceutical industry. In contrast, drug discovery programs that target components of the ubiquitin system have lagged behind. In this Perspective, we discuss the reasons for the delay in this pipeline, the drugs targeting the ubiquitin system that have been developed, and new approaches that may popularize this area of drug discovery in the future. It can take years, even decades, before a field of research reaches the stage of maturity at which its discoveries can obviously be exploited for the improvement of health. An excellent example of this paradigm is the regulation of protein function by reversible phosphorylation. Phosphorylation was identified in the mid 1950s as a mechanism for controlling glycogenolysis. Twenty-five years later, it was still largely thought of simply as a control switch for metabolism. Indeed, researchers finally realized that protein phosphorylation regulates most aspects of cell life only after many advances made throughout the 1980s and early 1990s (Cohen, 2002aCohen P. The origins of protein phosphorylation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E127-E130Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the idea that it would be possible to treat diseases with drugs targeting protein kinases was even slower to take root. Indeed, as late as 1998, the Head of Research and Development at one major pharmaceutical company (which no longer exists) told one of the authors that “there was absolutely no future in kinase drug discovery.” Later that same year, researchers revealed the remarkable clinical efficacy of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, called Gleevec, for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia. Quite quickly, protein kinases then became one of the most popular classes of drug targets for the pharmaceutical industry, especially in the field of cancer treatment. Over the past decade, 16 drugs targeting one or more protein kinases have been approved for clinical use in cancer, 12 taken orally as pills and 4 that are injected. As of 2009, 153 other protein kinase inhibitors were undergoing clinical trials, and 23 of these drugs were in the most advanced stage of development, termed Phase III (Table 1) (Lawler, 2009Lawler B. Kinase inhibitors.Global Markets BCC Market Research Report. 2009; BIO053BGoogle Scholar). The current global market for kinase therapies is about US$15 billion per annum, and this value is forecasted to double by 2020. Research on protein kinases currently accounts for ∼30% of the drug discovery programs in the pharmaceutical industry and over 50% of cancer research and development. The kinase inhibitors undergoing Phase III clinical trials include Pfizer's JAK3 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis (CP-690550) and Incyte Pharmaceutical's JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor (INCB18424) for treating inflammatory diseases. If these drugs are approved, it will likely spark a new wave of interest in developing kinase inhibitors for the treatment of diseases other than cancer.Table 1Phosphorylation, Ubiquitination, and Drug DiscoveryPhosphorylationUbiquitinationFirst publication 1955aFischer and Krebs, 1955.First publication 1978bCiechanover et al., 1978.>500 protein kinasescEncoded by the human genome.10 E1sfIncludes the E1s and E2s for ubiquitin-related modifiers such as Nedd8, SUMO, FAT10, and ISG15., ∼40 E2sfIncludes the E1s and E2s for ubiquitin-related modifiers such as Nedd8, SUMO, FAT10, and ISG15., >600 E3 ligasesfIncludes the E1s and E2s for ubiquitin-related modifiers such as Nedd8, SUMO, FAT10, and ISG15.140 protein phosphatasescEncoded by the human genome.∼90 deubiquitinasescEncoded by the human genome.Nobel Prize awarded 1992dNobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine awarded to Edmond Fischer and Edwin Krebs.Nobel Prize awarded 2004eNobel Prize for Chemistry awarded to Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko, and Irwin Rose.First drug approved in 2001 (Gleevec)First drug approved in 2003 (Bortezomib)16 drugs approved, over 150 undergoing clinical trialsOne drug approved, 16 undergoing clinical trialsCurrent sales ∼US$15 billion per yearCurrent sales ∼US$1.4 billion per year∼30% of pharmaceutical research and development<1% of pharmaceutical research and developmenta Fischer and Krebs, 1955Fischer E.H.

Open table in a new tab Even by the late 1970s and early 1980s researchers had shown that oncogenes, such as Src (sarcoma), are protein kinases; phorbol esters, which promote tumors, are kinase activators; and, growth factor receptors, which have kinase domains, are overexpressed or mutated in human cancer (reviewed in Cohen, 2002bCohen P. Protein kinases—the major drug targets of the twenty-first century?.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). So why did it take so long for most pharmaceutical companies to capitalize on the therapeutic potential of kinase inhibitors? In retrospect, one realizes that many researchers believed that kinase inhibitors were bad drug targets because they thought that it would be difficult to achieve the requisite specificity and potency. Most protein kinase inhibitors target the ATP-binding pockets of these enzymes, and the structural similarities of this site among many different kinases raised the suspicion that it would be impossible to develop drugs that inhibited only one type of protein kinase. Furthermore, the concentration of ATP in the cell is extremely high (i.e., millimolar), leading researchers to doubt whether compounds could be developed with the potency needed to compete successfully with intracellular ATP. These were, and indeed still are, challenging problems for many developing kinase inhibitors, but they have proven to be quite surmountable. Indeed, considerable potency and specificity have been achieved by developing compounds that target not only the ATP-binding site but also small hydrophobic pockets located proximal to the ATP-binding site. Moreover, researchers are identifying an increasing number of “allosteric” inhibitors that bind to other regions of a kinase. These compounds induce conformational changes in the kinase, which either suppress the enzyme's activity directly or block its activation by another kinase in the same signaling cascade. Furthermore, far from being a disadvantage, lack of specificity can actually be an advantage. For example, Gleevec was developed as an Abelson kinase inhibitor for the treatment of a specific type of leukemia. However, it is also an effective treatment for gastrointestinal stromal cancers because it inhibits the c-Kit receptor and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinases, which are overexpressed or mutated in gastrointestinal cancers (Demetri et al., 2006Demetri G.D. van Oosterom A.T. Garrett C.R. Blackstein M.E. Shah M.H. Verweij J. McArthur G. Judson I.R. Heinrich M.C. Morgan J.A. et al.Efficacy and safety of sunitinib in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour after failure of imatinib: a randomised controlled trial.Lancet. 2006; 368: 1329-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). In addition, the efficacy of several anticancer drugs depends on their combined inhibition of several different kinases, and these drugs may be less prone to the development of drug resistance than ones that act on only one specific kinase. Thus, some of the original prejudices against protein kinases as drug targets have subsequently turned out to have little substance. The beauty of targeting protein kinases for therapeutics and the basis for their popularity is that the same technologies and small-molecule libraries can be used to develop inhibitors of many types of protein kinases in almost every therapeutic area. However, the vast amount of medicinal chemistry that has been carried out in recent years has meant that novel patent space is becoming quite difficult to find. Plus, there is a growing, but probably unfounded, concern that the most important drug targets in this area have been fully exploited. Therefore, the pharmaceutical industry has begun to wonder where they may find the next large set of drug targets that can be tackled in a manner analogous to protein kinases. In this Perspective, we discuss the premise that components of the ubiquitin system are prime candidates for these new targets. Ubiquitination is the covalent attachment of a small protein, ubiquitin (∼8.5 kDa), to other proteins. In the first step, a thioester bond is formed between the C-terminal carboxylate group of ubiquitin and the thiol or sulfhydryl group of a cysteine residue on an E1-activating enzyme. Next, the ubiquitin is transferred to a cysteine on an E2-conjugating enzyme. In the third step, the E2 interacts with an E3 ligase, and the ubiquitin is then transferred from the E2 enzyme to substrates, which also interact with the E3 ligase. This last step can occur directly, as in the RING E3 ligases, or it can occur indirectly with the ubiquitin first transferred to a cysteine residue on the E3 ligase before being linked to the substrate, as in the HECT family of E3 ligases. Chains of ubiquitin are created by the same enzymatic process. Similar to phosphorylation, ubiquitin can be linked covalently to only one or several amino acid residues on the same protein (Figure 1). However, in contrast to protein phosphorylation, ubiquitin can also form polyubiquitin chains. Ubiquitin has seven lysine residues and an α-amino group; thus eight different types of polyubiquitin chains can form (and probably more because chains with “mixed” linkages are also present in cells). Even greater versatility is provided by ubiquitin-like proteins, such as Nedd8, SUMO (1, 2, and 3), FAT10, and ISG15, which are also attached covalently to proteins in processes called neddylation, SUMOylation, tenylation, and ISGylation, respectively. The formation of polyubiquitin chains and the existence of these “ubiquitin-like modifiers” make the ubiquitin system a more complex and potentially more versatile control mechanism than phosphorylation. Like phosphorylation, ubiquitination is reversible. Isopeptidases, called deubiquitinases or DUBs, catalyze the cleavage of the ubiquitin from proteins or “deubiquitination” (Figure 1). Interestingly, the number of deubiquitinases is comparable to the number of protein phosphatases, but taken together, the number of E1-activating enzymes, E2-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ligases encoded by the human genome exceeds the number of protein kinases. For many years, the sole function of the ubiquitin system was thought to be the regulation of protein turnover inside the cell. Attaching a chain of ubiquitins linked at lysine 48 (K48-linked polyubiquitination) to a protein directs it to the 26S proteasome for destruction, and indeed, this is one of the key functions of the ubiquitin system. However, other types of ubiquitination play distinct roles in the cell and regulate diverse areas of biology, as discussed in another article in this issue (Ikeda et al., 2010Ikeda F. Crosetto N. Dikic I. What determines the specificity and outcomes of ubiquitin signaling?.Cell. 2010; 143 (this issue): 677-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For example, K63-linked polyubiquitination (Bhoj and Chen, 2009Bhoj V.G. Chen Z.J.

Zagorska A. Chapman L. Deak M. Peggie M. Alessi D.R. Control of AMPK-related kinases by USP9X and atypical Lys(29)/Lys(33)-linked polyubiquitin chains.Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Like phosphorylation, ubiquitination can also induce conformational changes that alter biological function. For example, the response to the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) generates K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that interact with a component of the TAK1 complex, inducing a conformational change that allows this protein kinase to autoactivate (Xia et al., 2009Xia Z.P.

Similarly, monoubiquitination of the deubiquitinase Ataxin 3 (Todi et al., 2009Todi S.V. Winborn B.J. Scaglione K.M. Blount J.R. Travis S.M. Paulson H.L.

In contrast, monoubiquitination of the tumor suppressor p53 induces a conformational change that exposes a nuclear export signal. This leads to the translocation of p53 to the cytosol where it may promote apoptotic events (Carter et al., 2007Carter S. Bischof O. Dejean A. Vousden K.H. C-terminal modifications regulate MDM2 dissociation and nuclear export of p53.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Neddylation of the Cullin RING E3 ligases (CRLs) also induces conformational changes that bring the E2 active site adjacent to the substrate, permitting the efficient ubiquitination of the substrate by CRLs (Saha and Deshaies, 2008Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Multimodal activation of the ubiquitin ligase SCF by Nedd8 conjugation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Like phosphorylation, many effects of ubiquitination are mediated by interactions with ubiquitin-binding proteins. Different polyubiquitin chains adopt distinct three-dimensional structures and hence interact with different polyubiquitin-binding proteins to regulate distinct processes. For example, proteins tagged with K48-linked polyubiquitin chains are targeted for destruction because these ubiquitin chains bind to particular components of the 26S proteasome. More than 20 different families of polyubiquitin-binding proteins have been identified, and this area has become a large topic of research in its own right. Interactions through ubiquitin are also critical for DNA-damage signaling and for certain DNA-repair pathways. For example, the monoubiquitinated form of FANCD2, a component of the Fanconi Anemia Complex, interacts with the UBZ domain of the DNA nuclease FAN1, and this interaction through ubiquitin is essential for repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (MacKay et al., 2010MacKay C. Déclais A.C. Lundin C. Agostinho A. Deans A.J. MacArtney T.J. Hofmann K. Gartner A. West S.C. Helleday T. et al.Identification of KIAA1018/FAN1, a DNA repair nuclease recruited to DNA damage by monoubiquitinated FANCD2.Cell. 2010; 142: 65-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). K63-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to histone 2A and histone 2AX by the E3 ligase RNF8 and the E2 -conjugating enzyme Ubc13 (Kolas et al., 2007Kolas N.K. Chapman J.R. Nakada S. Ylanko J. Chahwan R. Sweeney F.D. Panier S. Mendez M. Wildenhain J. Thomson T.M. et al.Orchestration of the DNA-damage response by the RNF8 ubiquitin ligase.Science. 2007; 318: 1637-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) recruit and assemble factors that are essential for DNA repair, such as BRCA1 (breast cancer 1), RAP80, and other proteins (Bennett and Harper, 2008Bennett E.J. Harper J.W. DNA damage: ubiquitin marks the spot.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 20-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is important to emphasize that protein phosphorylation and protein ubiquitination are not distinct and separate control mechanisms because the interplay between them is critical for the regulation of many cellular processes. For example, phosphorylation regulates a number of E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases. Further, the E3 ligase Skp1-Cullin-F box (SCF) and some other E3 ligases contain an additional component βTRCP (β-transducin repeat-containing protein), which recognizes particular phosphorylated sequence motifs that direct the SCFβTRCP complex to ubiquitinate these substrates. Finally, a number of kinases can be activated or inhibited by interactions with polyubiquitin chains or by polyubiquitination. Given the omnipresence of protein phosphorylation and ubiquitination inside the cell, understanding the interplay between these two systems is likely to become increasingly more important over the next decade. The protease inhibitor Bortezomib, originally called PS341 and then Velcade (Adams, 2002Adams J. Development of the proteasome inhibitor PS-341.Oncologist. 2002; 7: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), was the first drug that targets a component of the ubiquitin system to be approved for clinical use in the United States. Developed by ProScript Inc in 1995, Bortezomib entered clinical trials in 1997 and was approved by the Federal Drug Administration in 2003. In 1999 ProScript was acquired by Leukosite, which in turn was acquired by Millenium Pharmaceuticals later that same year. Bortezomib has been quite successful, with worldwide sales in 2009 of US$1.4 billion, and this achievement led Takeda to acquire Millenium in 2008. Bortezomib was approved as a front-line treatment for B cell lymphoma found primarily in the bone marrow. It is also used for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma in patients who have already received other treatments. It is in Phase III clinical trials for follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Phase II trials for diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and a great many other clinical trials (reviewed in Tcherpakov, 2010Tcherpakov M. Ubiquitin proteasome drug discovery (cancer and other markets).BCC Research Report. 2010; PHM066AGoogle Scholar). Bortezomib, which is given by intravenous injection, has remarkable efficacy against multiple myeloma, but the molecular mechanism underlying its effect is still unclear. Nevertheless, the multiple myeloma cells that are particularly sensitive to proteasome inhibitors express lower levels of proteasome particles and have a higher proteasome workload than multiple myeloma cells that are relatively resistant to these drugs. Thus, the balance between proteasome workload and degradative capacity may be an important determinant of the sensitivity of a cancer cell to Bortezomib and other proteasome inhibitors (Bianchi et al., 2009Bianchi G. Oliva L. Cascio P. Pengo N. Fontana F. Cerruti F. Orsi A. Pasqualetto E. Mezghrani A. Calbi V. et al.The proteasome load versus capacity balance determines apoptotic sensitivity of multiple myeloma cells to proteasome inhibition.Blood. 2009; 113: 3040-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A dipeptidyl boronic acid, Bortezomib binds noncovalently to the 20S proteasome and primarily inhibits its chymotrypsin-like activity (Kisselev et al., 2006Kisselev A.F. Callard A. Goldberg A.L. Importance of the different proteolytic sites of the proteasome and the efficacy of inhibitors varies with the protein substrate.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8582-8590Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Its success has led to considerable interest in developing improved “second generation” inhibitors, and Millenium/Takeda has another proteasome inhibitor, MLN9708, which can be taken orally, in Phase 1 clinical trials. Onyx Pharmaceuticals also has several orally active proteasome inhibitors in clinical trials, which they obtained through the acquisition of Proteolix. These inhibitors include Carfilzomib, which has recently entered Phase III trials according to the website http://clinicaltrials.gov. Other proteasome inhibitors that are currently undergoing clinical development are listed in Table 2. The Nedd8 protein shares ∼60% sequence identity with ubiquitin, and it is conjugated to its target proteins in a similar manner to ubiquitin, with a specific E1-activating enzyme (NAE-E1) and the E2-conjugating enzymes Ube2M and/or Ube2F. The primary target for neddylation appears to be the Cullin components of Cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligases. The Cullin RING ligases are the largest family of E3 ligases in the human genome with more than 100 members (Rabut and Peter, 2008Rabut G. Peter M. Function and regulation of protein neddylation. ‘Protein modifications: beyond the usual suspects’ review series.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Neddylation permits efficient ubiquitination by Cullin RING ligases; neddylation induces a conformational change in the Cullin component to bring the E2 active site adjacent to the lysine residue of its protein target substrates (Duda et al., 2008Duda D.M. Borg L.A. Scott D.C. Hunt H.W. Hammel M.

Deshaies R.J. Multimodal activation of the ubiquitin ligase SCF by Nedd8 conjugation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Millenium/Takeda has developed a relatively specific inhibitor of the NAE-E1 enzyme (Table 3). This compound, MLN4924, showed promise in mouse models of cancer and has entered Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. MLN4924 seems to exert its effect on these cancers by deregulating DNA synthesis during the S phase of the cell division cycle. MLN4924 appears to stabilize Cdt1, a DNA replication licensing factor normally ubiquitinated by a Cullin RING E3 ligase and then degraded by the proteasome (Soucy et al., 2009Soucy T.A. Smith P.G. Milhollen M.A. Berger A.J. Gavin J.M. Adhikari S. Brownell J.E. Burke K.E. Cardin D.P. Critchley S. et al.An inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme as a new approach to treat cancer.Nature. 2009; 458: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Deubiquitinases comprise five separate gene families. Four families are cysteine proteinases (the USP, OTU, UCH, and MJD deubiquitinases), and the other one consists of metallo-proteinases (the JAMM/MPN domain family). The E3 ligase HDM2 targets the tumor suppressor p53 for degradation. One of the cysteine protease deubiquitinases, USP7 (ubiquitin-specific protease 7), deubiquitinates HDM2, leading to increased levels of HDM2 and decreased levels of p53. Therefore, two companies, Progenra and Hybrigenics, have developed inhibitors of USP7 (i.e., P5091 and HBX 41108, respectively) (Colland et al., 2009Colland F. Formstecher E. Jacq X. Reverdy C. Planquette C. Conrath S. Trouplin V. Bianchi J. Aushev V.N. Camonis J. et al.Small-molecule inhibitor of USP7/HAUSP ubiquitin protease stabilizes and activates p53 in cells.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2009; 8: 2286-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), with the hope of promoting the proteasomal degradation of HDM2 by enhancing its polyubiquitination. Reduced expression of HDM2 would then be expected to increase the level of p53. Progenra is also developing inhibitors targeting USP20, and they are showing interest in agents for USP2a, USP33, and AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM) (http://www.progenra.com/scientist.html, 2009). USP20, also called VDU2 (von Hippel-Lindau deubiquitinating enzyme 2), deubiquitinates and stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) (Li et al., 2005Li Z. Wang D. Messing E.M. Wu G. VHL protein-interacting deubiquitinating enzyme 2 deubiquitinates and stabilizes HIF-1alpha.EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). HIF-1α is expressed at high levels in many human cancers because it is stabilized at the low concentration of dissolved oxygen inside the tumor by high cytokine levels and by specific genetic alterations. For example, in von Hippel-Lindau disease, in which individuals develop a variety of tumors, mutations in the VHL gene compromise the ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α, leading to the accumulation and overexpression of HIF-1α and its target genes. Therefore, inhibitors of USP20 (VDU2) and/or USP33 (VDU1) may reduce levels of HIF-1α by enhancing its polyubiquitination. Novartis has patented compounds that inhibit the deubiquitinases USP2 and UCH-L3 (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase). USP2 is another deubiquitinase reported to target MDM2, the mouse ortholog of HDM2 (Stevenson et al., 2007Stevenson L.F. Sparks A. Allende-Vega N. Xirodimas D.P. Lane D.P. Saville M.K. The deubiquitinating enzyme USP2a regulates the p53 pathway by targeting Mdm2.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whereas UCH-L3 probably plays a role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. Recently, researchers identified a small-molecule inhibitor of USP14, called IU1, which did not inhibit eight other deubiquitylases tested, demonstrating the feasibility of developing relatively specific inhibitors of these enzymes (Lee et al., 2010Lee B.H. Lee M.J. Park S. Oh D.C. Elsasser S. Chen P.C. Gartner C. Dimova N. Hanna J. Gygi S.P. et al.Enhancement of proteasome activity by a small-molecule inhibitor of USP14.Nature. 2010; 467: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). USP14 is associated with the proteasome, and treating cells with IU1 enhanced the degradation of several proteasomal substrates that have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Tau. Drugs that target USP14 could, therefore, have a potential use in reducing or eliminating misfolded and aggregated proteins that accumulate in neurodegenerative and other diseases. Developing pharmaceutical agents that target deubiquitinases is still in its infancy, and to our knowledge, no deubiquitinase inhibitor has yet entered clinical trials. However, as this field progresses, it is clearly going to be essential to assess the specificities of these inhibitors. Therefore, assembling comprehensive panels of deubiquitinases for testing specificity will be critical, similar to how large panels of protein kinases have been of immense value in assessing the selectivity of kinase inhibitors. As with kinases, there are certainly going to be deubiquitinases for which inhibition needs to be avoided. For example, mutating or deleting the A20 deubiquitinase causes or predisposes individuals to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (Musone et al., 2008Musone S.L. Taylor K.E. Lu T.T. Nititham J. Ferreira R.C. Ortmann W. Shifrin N. Petri M.A. Kamboh M.I. Manzi S. et al.Multiple polymorphisms in the TNFAIP3 region are independently associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.Nat.

Loss- and gain-of-function analysis in a prostate sphere assay indicates that Bmi-1 expression is required for self-renewal activity and maintenance of p63(+) stem cells. Loss of Bmi-1 blocks the self-renewal activity induced by heightened β-catenin signaling, suggesting that Bmi-1 is required for full activity of another self-renewal pathway. In vivo, Bmi-1 expression is necessary for normal prostate tubule regeneration. Altered self-renewal and proliferation through Bmi-1 modulation diminishes the susceptibility of prostate cells to transformation. In an in vivo prostate regeneration system, Bmi-1 inhibition protects prostate cells from FGF10-driven hyperplasia and slows the growth of aggressive Pten-deletion-induced prostate cancer. We conclude that Bmi-1 is a crucial regulator of self-renewal in adult prostate cells and plays important roles in prostate cancer initiation and progression."

https://openalex.org/W2008441088,"The Reelin ligand regulates a Dab1-dependent signaling pathway required for brain lamination and normal dendritogenesis, but the specific mechanisms underlying these actions remain unclear. We find that Stk25, a modifier of Reelin-Dab1 signaling, regulates Golgi morphology and neuronal polarization as part of an LKB1-Stk25-Golgi matrix protein 130 (GM130) signaling pathway. Overexpression of Stk25 induces Golgi condensation and multiple axons, both of which are rescued by Reelin treatment. Reelin stimulation of cultured neurons induces the extension of the Golgi into dendrites, which is suppressed by Stk25 overexpression. In vivo, Reelin and Dab1 are required for the normal extension of the Golgi apparatus into the apical dendrites of hippocampal and neocortical pyramidal neurons. This demonstrates that the balance between Reelin-Dab1 signaling and LKB1-Stk25-GM130 regulates Golgi dispersion, axon specification, and dendrite growth and provides insights into the importance of the Golgi apparatus for cell polarization."

The crystal structure of a complex between the 40-nucleotide ENE core and oligo(A)(9) RNA at 2.5 angstrom resolution reveals that unlike snoRNAs, the U-rich loop of the ENE engages its target through formation of a major-groove triple helix. A-minor interactions extend the binding interface. Deadenylation assays confirm the functional importance of the triple helix. Thus, the ENE acts as an intramolecular RNA clamp, sequestering the PAN poly(A) tail and preventing the initiation of RNA decay."

We found that the resulting miRNA profiles divided the iPSCs and hESCs examined into two distinct categories irrespective of the cell line origin. The miRNAs that defined these two pluripotency categories also distinguished cancer cells from differentiated cells. Transcriptome analysis suggested that several gene sets related to p53 distinguished these categories, and overexpression of the p53-targeting miRNAs miR-92 and miR-141 in iPSCs was sufficient to change their classification status. Thus, our results suggest a subdivision of pluripotent stem cell states that is independent of their origin but related to p53 network status."

In response to a lesion, astrocytes give rise to ependymal cells and ependymal cells give rise to niche astrocytes. We identify EphB2 forward signaling as a key pathway regulating niche cell plasticity.

We studied the pattern of cell division in the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta and found that both the rate of cell division and the duration of growth of the wing imaginal disks depend on the size of the body in which they develop.

https://openalex.org/W2091238879,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) respond to agonists to activate downstream enzymatic pathways or to gate ion channel function. Turning off GPCR signaling is known to involve phosphorylation of the GPCR by GPCR kinases (GRKs) to initiate their internalization. The process, however, is relatively slow and cannot account for the faster desensitization responses required to regulate channel gating. Here, we show that GRKs enable rapid desensitization of the G protein-coupled potassium channel (GIRK/Kir3.x) through a mechanism independent of their kinase activity. On GPCR activation, GRKs translocate to the membrane and quench channel activation by competitively binding and titrating G protein βγ subunits away from the channel. Of interest, the ability of GRKs to effect this rapid desensitization depends on the receptor type. The findings thus reveal a stimulus-specific, phosphorylation-independent mechanism for rapidly downregulating GPCR activity at the effector level."

Despite limited sequence similarity, SUMO and ubiquitin have highly homologous structures (i.e., with a root-mean-square deviation [rmsd] difference of 2.1 A). Like ubiquitin, SUMO is covalently attached to other proteins (SUMOylation) and thus functions as a posttranslational modifier. Although a major function of ubiquitination is to promote protein degradation, SUMOylation does not usually trigger proteolyis of the conjugated protein. Instead, a main function of SUMOylation is to foster—and occasionally disrupt—protein-protein interactions.Although less frequent than ubiquitination, SUMOylation regulates numerous processes and has many substrates in the cytosol and the nucleus. Lower eukaryotes possess only one SUMO form, but higher eukaryotes express several, perhaps functionally distinct, SUMO variants. In most organisms, SUMO is essential for viability.

Moreover, the data reveal that the α3-β5 region of Gα(s) is a functionally important motif in the Gα(s)-mediated microtubule destabilization. Indeed, peptides corresponding to that region of Gα(s) mimic Gα(s) protein in activating tubulin GTPase and increase microtubule dynamic instability.

The data allow for a model of the Gα(s)/tubulin interface in which Gα(s) binds to the microtubule plus-end and activates the intrinsic tubulin GTPase. This model illuminates both the role of tubulin as an ""effector"" (e.g. adenylyl cyclase) for Gα(s) and the role of Gα(s) as a GTPase activator for tubulin.

Intriguingly, this quaternary complex has the same apparent hydrodynamic volume as the unliganded PDZ region, suggesting that a conformational change occurs in the PDZ region upon binding, a conclusion supported by kinetic experiments. Using NMR, we discovered a new mode of interaction between E6 and PDZ: a subset of residues distal to the canonical binding pocket in the PDZ(2) domain exhibited noncanonical interactions with the E6 protein. This is consistent with a larger proportion of the protein surface defining binding specificity, as compared with that reported previously."
https://openalex.org/W2090746741,"Recent studies highlight the existence of a nuclear lipid metabolism related to cellular proliferation. However, the importance of nuclear phosphatidylcholine (PC) metabolism is poorly understood. Therefore, we were interested in nuclear PC as a source of second messengers and, particularly, nuclear localization of PC-specific phospholipase D (PLD). In the present study we have identified the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of PLD1 whose mutation abolished its nuclear import. Recently, we reported that caspase-mediated cleavage of PLD1 generates the N-terminal fragment (NF-PLD1) and C-terminal fragment (CF-PLD1). Here we show that CF-PLD1 but not NF-PLD1, is exclusively imported into the nucleus via its functional NLS, whereas only some portions of intact PLD1 were localized into the nucleus. The NLS of intact PLD1 or CF-PLD1 is required for interaction with importin-β, which is known to mediate nuclear import. The amount of intact PLD1 or CF-PLD1 translocated into nucleus is correlated with its binding affinity with importin-β. Ultimately, nuclear localization of intact PLD1 but not CF-PLD1 mediates the activation of nuclear protein kinase Cα and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways. Taken together, we propose that nuclear localization of PLD1 via the NLS and its interaction with importin-β may provide new insights on the functional role of nuclear PLD1 signaling.

It is becoming increasingly evident that stimulation of nuclear lipid metabolism plays a central role in many signal transduction pathways that ultimately result in various cell responses including proliferation and differentiation. An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated that the nucleus is a site of active lipid metabolism for both synthesis and hydrolysis (1Martelli A.M. Falà F. Faenza I. Billi A.M. Cappellini A.

Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Nuclear lipid metabolism is regulated independently from that of the plasma membrane because there are extracellular stimuli that cause the generation of lipid signaling molecules only in the nucleus and not in the plasma membrane (3Maraldi N.M. Zini N. Santi S. Manzoli F.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Nuclear lipid second messengers are likely involved in the control of cell proliferation and gene expression (4Martelli A.M. Capitani S. Neri L.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 273-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Tamiya-Koizumi K. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nuclear phosphoinositides have received a considerable degree of attention. Nevertheless, there are many reports that have dealt with metabolism and signaling activities of nuclear phosphatidylcholine (PC) 2The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PLD1, phospholipase D1; NLS, nuclear localization sequences; LMB, leptomycin B; FL, full-length; MDM2, murine double minute 2; NLM, NLS mutant; DG, diacylglycerol; CF, C-terminal fragment; NF, N-terminal fragment. and sphingolipids (5Tamiya-Koizumi K.

Like its extranuclear counterpart, nuclear PC comprises the major phospholipid class within that compartment (6Hunt A.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PLD is a signal-activated enzyme that catalyzes phosphatidylcholine, producing phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline (7Rudge S.A. Wakelam M.J. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2009; 1791: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two distinct isoforms of mammalian PLD, PLD1 and PLD2, have been identified (7Rudge S.A. Wakelam M.J. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2009; 1791: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although most research on PLD-mediated PC metabolism focused on cellular membrane, PC also has been associated with the nuclear envelope, chromatin, and the nuclear matrix (8Albi E. Mersel M. Leray C. Tomassoni M.L. Viola-Magni M.P. Lipids. 1994; 29: 715-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Neitcheva T. Peeva D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies from several laboratories have demonstrated the presence of a PC-specific PLD activity associated with nuclei. G protein-dependent and oleate-dependent PLD activity has been identified in nuclei from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (10Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29843-29847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), IIC9 fibroblasts (11Baldassare J.J. Jarpe M.B. Alferes L. Raben D.M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 541: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and vascular smooth muscle cells (13Gayral S. Déléris P. Laulagnier K. Laffargue M. Salles J.P. Perret B. Record M. Breton-Douillon M. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the isoform responsible and regulation of its nuclear localization have yet to be established. Changes in nucleocytoplasmic localization might represent a mode of PLD regulation in nuclear PC metabolism. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate nuclear translocation of PLD remain unknown. Depending on the size of the protein, nuclear import through the nuclear pore complex can occur through either passive diffusion (for small molecules of less than 40–50 kDa) or by an active process facilitated by the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) present in nuclear protein (14Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). NLSs are usually recognized by the heterodimeric receptor proteins importin-β and importin-α (15Görlich D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Here, we have defined a functional NLS of PLD1. Recently, we have reported that caspase-mediated cleavage of PLD1 during apoptosis generates the N-terminal fragment (NF-PLD1) and the C-terminal fragment (CF-PLD1) (16Jang Y.H. Namkoong S. Kim Y.M. Lee S.J. Park B.J. Min D.S. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1782-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that CF-PLD1 but not NF-PLD1 is exclusively imported into the nucleus via its functional NLS, whereas a portion of intact PLD1 was localized into nucleus. The NLS of intact PLD1 or CF-PLD1 associates with importin-β and mediates its nuclear import. The nuclear localization of intact PLD1 but not CF-PLD1 mediates the activation of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the nucleus. Taken together, our current study sheds light on yet not understood molecular mechanisms regulating nuclear localization of PLD, a timely topic with important implications in nuclear signaling of PLD. HEK293, U87MG, U251MG, U373MG, and T98G cells were cultured at 37 °C in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic. Cells were grown to 60% confluence for transient transfection using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Leptomycin B (LMB), phorbol myristate acetate and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were from Calbiochem. PLD1 inhibitor (VU0155069) was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann. Arbor, MI). The siRNA of 21-nucleotide sequences corresponding to human PLD1 sequences (nucleotides 1571–1591, AAGGUGGGACGACAAUGAGCA) was purchased from Dharmacon Research Inc (Lafayette, CO). PLD1 inhibitor (VU0155069) was from Cayman Chemical. Cloning of GFP-tagged full-length (FL)-, NF-, and CF-PLD1 has been previously described (16Jang Y.H. Namkoong S. Kim Y.M. Lee S.J. Park B.J. Min D.S. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1782-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). GST-PLD1 fragments were kindly provided by Dr. Sung Ho Ryu (Pohang University of Science and Technology, Korea). GST-importin-β was kindly provided by Dr. Hoyun Lee (Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Canada). Site-directed mutagenesis of the NLS (K553A/R555A/K556A/K559A/K564A) of PLD1 was generated by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutation was then confirmed by DNA sequencing. Primers for generation of the NLS mutant PLD1 are as follows: NLM1 (K553A/R555A/K556A) (5′-forward (CTGAAAGGAATAGGAGCCCCAGCAGCCTTCTCCA-AATTTAG) and 3′-reverse (CTAAATTTGGAGAAGGCTGCTGGGGCTCCTATTCCTTTCAG); NLM (K553A/R555A/K556A/K559A/K564A) (5′-forward GCAGCCTTCTCCGCATTTAGTCTCTACGCGCAGCTCCAC) and 3′-reverse (GTGGAGCTGCGCGTAGAG ACTAAATGCGGAGAAGGCTGC). Mutagenesis for generation of NLM-CF- or NLM-FL-PLD1 was performed using NLM1-CF-PLD1 or NLM1-FL-PLD1 as a template. For measurement of PLD activity, cells were labeled with [3H]myristic acid, and PLD activity was assessed by measurement of formation of [3H]phosphatidylbutanol, the product of PLD-mediated transphosphatidylation, in the presence of 1-butanol, as previously described (17Kim J. Lee Y.H. Kwon T.K. Chang J.S. Chung K.C. Min D.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The lysates of HEK293 cells were incubated with 3 μg of GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in a final volume of 500 μl of lysis buffer for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed 4 times with washing buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Associated protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoreactivity was detected using the indicated antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro transcription and translation of FL-PLD and CF-PLD1 were carried out using the TnT Quick Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Freshly synthesized proteins were added to bead-bound GST fusion proteins and allowed to bind at 4 °C, and then associated protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoreactivity was detected using the same methods with the above in vitro binding experiment. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot and/or immunoprecipitation as previously described (18Ahn B.H. Kim S.Y. Kim E.H. Choi K.S. Kwon T.K. Lee Y.H. Chang J.S. Kim M.S. Jo Y.H. Min D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3103-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for signal detection. The following antibodies were used: anti-α-tubulin (Sigma), anti-GFP (Santa Cruz), anti-murine double minute 2 (Santa Cruz), anti-importin-β (Santa Cruz), anti-caspase3 (Cell Signaling), anti-lamin B (Santa Cruz), anti-phospho PKCα (Cell Signaling), anti-PKCα (Santa Cruz), anti-phospho ERK (Cell Signaling), anti-ERK (Cell Signaling). Rabbit polyclonal anti-PLD antibody that recognizes both PLD1 and PLD2 was generated as previously described (19Min D.S. Ahn B.H. Rhie D.J. Yoon S.H. Hahn S.J. Kim M.S. Jo Y.H. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with various PLD1 constructs and incubated with media containing 1 mg/ml Hoechst (Molecular Probes, CA) for 20 min. Cells were visualized, and images were collected using a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200 m, Zwiss, Germany) and a confocal fluorescence microscopy (LXM510, Zeiss, Germany). For immunocytochemistry, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde, PBS for 10 min followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS, blocked for 2 h in 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and then incubated with primary antibody, BSA for 2 h. Cells were washed four times with PBS and then incubated with anti-rabbit Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody or anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) containing 1 mg/ml Hoechst for 1 h. Cells were washed again four times with PBS and mounted with antifading mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Cells were visualized, and images were collected using a fluorescence microscope. Using a commercially available kit, nuclear and cytosolic fractions were separated according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Purity of the nuclear and cytosolic fraction was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibody to lamin B and α-tubulin, respectively. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of the number of determinations indicated. Statistical significance of differences was determined by analysis of variance. Significance was accepted when p < 0.01. Evidence is being accumulated on the importance of internal nuclear lipid metabolism. Nuclear lipid metabolism gives rise to several lipid second messengers that function within the nucleus. Thus, we examined the presence of nuclear PLD hydrolyzing nuclear PC. As shown in Fig. 1A, PLD1 was detected not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus in HEK293 cells as analyzed by Western blot using antibody to PLD that recognizes both PLD1 and PLD2 (Fig. 1A). PLD1 is predominantly expressed in HEK293 cells. Purity of the nuclear and cytosolic fraction was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibody to nuclear marker, lamin B, or the cytosolic marker, α-tubulin. The relative percentage of cytosolic and nuclear PLD1 fraction from the total cellular PLD pool, was examined. Each sample represents the fraction from the same number of total cell equivalents. As shown in Fig. 1A, cytosolic PLD1 accounts for about 38% of the total cellular PLD pool, and nuclear PLD1 accounts for 13% of the total PLD pool. To further confirm the nuclear localization of PLD1, HEK293 cells were immunostained with anti-PLD antibody and analyzed by confocal scanning laser microscopy. The localization of PLD1 was comparable with that of the immunoblot, and PLD1 was detected in the nucleus as well as cytosol (Fig. 1B). No red labeling was observed when the primary antibody was omitted (data not shown). Moreover, we examined whether PLD is localized in the nucleus from various human glioma cells, which show highly invasive characteristics and elevated expression of PLD in comparison with that of normal glial cells (20Park M.H. Ahn B.H. Hong Y.K. Min do S. Carcinogenesis. 2009; 30: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PLD1 and PLD2 were detected in the nucleus as well as cytosol in four kinds of glioma cells (Fig. 1C). These data suggest the presence of the PC-PLD protein in the nucleus. Nuclear localization of PLD1 could result from either import into the nucleus or the inhibition of nuclear export. To address this latter possibility, HEK293 cells expressing endogenous PLD1 were treated with an inhibitor of the CRM-1 exportin pathway, LMB, and the localization of PLD1 was examined (Fig. 2A). As a positive control, murine double minute 2 (MDM2), which is exported from the nucleus by CRM-1 exportin pathway, was predominantly localized in cytoplasm in untreated cells. Treatment with LMB resulted in the nuclear accumulation of MDM2, whereas localization of PLD1 was not affected by LMB treatment. To further confirm that nuclear PLD1 is not due to suppressed nuclear export, we performed Western blot analysis of the nuclear versus cytoplasmic fractions from control versus LMB-treated cells. LMB treatment induced nuclear accumulation of MDM2 but not of PLD1 (Fig. 2B). This result is comparable with that of Fig. 2A. The level of MDM2 and PLD1 was quantitated using densitometer analysis. The purity of the nuclear and cytosolic fraction was examined by immunoblotting with antibody to nuclear marker, lamin B, or the cytosolic marker, α-tubulin (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the presence of PLD1 in the nucleus does not result from inhibition of nuclear export. Next, we investigated the amino acid sequences involved in the nuclear import using the PSORTII program (21Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). We have identified a series of basic amino acids (553KPRK556) in the loop region, as seen in many classical NLSs (22Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In addition, we noticed two additional basic amino acids (Lys-559 and Lys-564) located in the near of 553KRPK556 (Fig. 3A). These sequences are highly conserved in mammalian PLD1 from different species. We could not find the putative NLS of PLD2. To determine whether or not the putative NLS is functional for nuclear import of PLD1, an intact PLD1 construct was generated by mutation of lysine and arginine residues within the putative NLS. The NLS mutant (NLM)-PLD1 harbors mutations in five lysine residues, which were changed to alanine (K553A/R555A/K556A/K559A/K564A) (Fig. 3A). Wild type or the mutant form of PLD1 was transfected into HEK293 cells and fractionated into nuclear and cytosolic fraction, then analyzed by immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 3B, an intact GFP-PLD1 was detected in both cytosolic and nuclear fraction, whereas GFP-NLM-PLD1 was localized exclusively in the cytosol but not in the nucleus. These data demonstrate that the NLS of PLD1 is required for its nuclear import. To compare relative levels and localization of the endogenous versus heterologously expressed PLD1, Western blot was performed using anit-PLD1 antibody (Fig. 3B). Exogenous GFP-PLD1 and endogenous PLD1 showed similar localization pattern in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions. Exogenous GFP-PLD1 did not affect the localization of the endogenous PLD1. The endogenous PLD1 expression level was quantitated. Ectopic expression of PLD1 increased the protein level of the endogenous PLD1. This result is correlated with our recent report that PLD activity is coupled to selective induction of PLD1 expression (23Kang D.W. Park M.H. Lee Y.J. Kim H.S. Lindsley C.W. Brown H.A. Min D.S. Int. J. Cancer. 2011; 128: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To examine whether nuclear localization of PLD1 affects its enzymatic activity, PLD activity was measured. We observed that basal and phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated PLD activity was independent of NLS (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the mutated residues are required for localization but not activity. Recently, we reported that caspase-mediated cleavage of PLD1 during apoptosis results in the production of NF-PLD1 and CF-PLD1 (16Jang Y.H. Namkoong S. Kim Y.M. Lee S.J. Park B.J. Min D.S. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1782-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Whereas NF-PLD1 lacks the NLS, CF-PLD1 contains the NLS. Thus, we examined the localization of PLD1 cleavage products using fluorescence microscopy and Western blot. To further define the functional NLS motif, two kinds of putative NLS mutants were generated using GFP-tagged CF-PLD1. NLM-CF-PLD1 contains both mutation of adjacent lysine residues (K559A, K564A) as well as one stretch of basic amino acids (553KPRK556), and NLM1-CF-PLD1 contains mutation of one stretch of basic amino acids (Fig. 4A). NF-PLD1 (1–545 amino acids) was exclusively localized in the cytoplasm as a diffuse distribution, whereas CF-PLD1 (546–1036 amino acids) was predominantly localized in the nucleus (Fig. 4B) as shown by fluorescence microscopy. To rule out any effect on localization of CF-PLD1 resulting from the GFP fusion, we examined the localization using FLAG-tagged CF-PLD1. FLAG-tagged CF-PLD1 was also localized exclusively in the nucleus (data not shown). As shown in fluorescence microscopy, NLM-CF-PLD1 exclusively shows cytosolic distribution but not nuclear localization, whereas NLM1-CF-PLD1 is evenly distributed in both the cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 4B). To further confirm the localization pattern of these proteins, HEK293 cells were transfected with these constructs, and the lysates were fractionated into cytosol and nucleus. As shown in Fig. 4C, NF-PLD1 and CF-PLD1 were exclusively localized in the cytosol and nucleus, respectively. NLM1-CF-PLD1 was detected evenly in cytosol and nucleus, whereas NLM-CF-PLD1 was predominantly detected in the cytosol but not in the nucleus. Thus, it is suggested that NLM but not NLM1 is sufficient for nuclear import of CF-PLD1. These results are consistent with those obtained from fluorescence microscopy. Exogenous CF-PLD1 detected by anti-GFP and anti-PLD antibodies showed similar localization patterns (Fig. 4C). When GFP-tagged NF- or CF-PLD1 was transfected, exogenous PLD1 did not affect localization of endogenous PLD1. Taken together, these data demonstrate that nuclear import of CF-PLD1 involves the functional NLS (553KPRK556/K559/K564) motif. To determine whether or not nuclear translocation of PLD1 involves the importin-β pathway, we examined the endogenous interaction between PLD1 and importin-β in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, PLD1 displayed specific binding to importin-β, as analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot. Their interaction was not observed by preimmune IgG. Then we investigated which region of PLD1 is associated with importin-β. Importin-β interacted with F3 fragment of PLD1 (499–604 amino acids), which contains NLS motif (553–564 amino acids) as analyzed by a glutathione S-transferase-PLD pull down assay (Fig. 5B). We then investigated the question of whether or not the association between PLD1 and importin-β is mediated through the NLS. As shown in Fig. 5C, wild type of FL-PLD1 was associated with importin-β, whereas NLM-PLD1 did not interact with importin-β. Moreover, NF-PLD1 not localized into nucleus did not interact with importin-β, whereas CF-PLD1 very strongly interacted with importin-β. Interestingly, importin-β showed more strong interaction with CF-PLD1 compared with that of FL-PLD1. Considering that only some portion of FL-PLD1 is localized in nucleus and CF-PLD1 is exclusively localized in nucleus, it is suggested that the amount of PLD1 imported into the nucleus is correlated with binding affinity with importin-β. Additionally, NLM-CF-PLD1 did not interact with importin-β, whereas NLM1-CF-PLD1 exhibited weak binding to importin-β compared with that of CF-PLD1 (Fig. 5D). Therefore, the binding affinity of NLM- or NLM1-CF-PLD1 with importin-β is also correlated with the amount of CF-PLD1 imported into nucleus. We have normalized and quantified the binding of CF-PLD1 or FL-PLD1 with importin-β relative to the level of ectopically expressed CF-PLD, FL-PLD1, or endogenous importin-β using densitometer analysis (Fig. 5, C and D). Furthermore, we also examined whether this interaction is direct using GST-importin-β and in vitro translated FL-PLD1 or CF-PLD1. Αs shown in Fig. 5E, importin-β directly interacted with FL-PLD1 or CF-PLD1. Especially, importin-β showed more strong binding with CF-PLD1 compared with FL-PLD1. These data are comparable to the result from immunoprecipitation. Taken together, these results suggest that the NLS motif of PLD1 associates with importin-β and, thus, mediates its nuclear translocation. There is general consensus over the fact that activation of nuclear PLD leads to increased levels of diacylglycerol (DG) in the nucleus, which stimulate classical protein kinase C (1Martelli A.M. Falà F. Faenza I. Billi A.M. Cappellini A. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether nuclear localization of PLD1 may affect nuclear PKC or ERK signaling. As shown Fig. 6A, ectopic expression of wild type of FL-PLD1 in HEK293 cells increased the phosphorylation of both cytosolic and nuclear PKCα compared with that of vector-transfected cells. The phosphorylation of nuclear PKCα in ΝLΜ-PLD1-tranfected cells was suppressed compared with that of wild type PLD1-transfected cells PLD1, whereas NLM-PLD1 increased the phosphorylation of cytosolic PKCα, comparable to that of wild type PLD1. Moreover, wild type of PLD1 enhanced the phosphorylation of both cytosolic and nuclear ERK, whereas NLM-PLD1 induced the activation of only cytosolic ERK but not nuclear ERK. On the contrary, CF-PLD1 and NLM-CF-PLD1 did not affect phosphorylation of PKCα and ERK in both the cytosol and nucleus compared with those of vector-transfected cells (Fig. 6B). Because NLM-PLD1 has enzymatic activity similar to that of wild type PLD1 but is not present in the nucleus and CF-PLD1 has no PLD activity, it is suggested that enzymatic activity of PLD1 is responsible for the activation of PKCα and ERK in the nucleus and cytosol. To further confirm whether nuclear PLD1 is required for the activation of nuclear PKCα and ERK, we examined the effect of knockdown of PLD1 on PDGF-induced phosphorylation of PKCα and ERK. As shown in Fig. 7A, PDGF increased the phosphorylation of PKCα and ERK in both the cytosol and nucleus in control siRNA-transfected HEK293 cells, whereas depletion of PLD1 suppressed PDGF-induced activation of PKCα and ERK in the nucleus as well as the cytosol. Furthermore, PLD1 inhibitor (VU0155069) abolished PDGF-induced phosphorylation of PKCα and ERK in both the cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 7B), suggesting that PLD activity is required for the activation of nuclear and cytosolic PKCα or ERK. We further tried to confirm that enzymatic activity of PLD1 is responsible for the activation of PKCα and ERK. As shown in Fig. 7C, the catalytically inactive form of PLD1 (KRM-PLD1; mutation of lysine to arginine in the catalytic region of PLD1) suppressed the activation of these kinases. Taken together, these data indicate that nuclear PLD1 mediates nuclear signaling of PKCα and ERK. To our knowledge this study is the first demonstration that nuclear localization of PLD1 mediates the activation of nuclear PKCα and ERK signaling pathways. In the literature there are reports of the presence and suggested functions of most of the phospholipid constituents of the cell nucleus. The PC cycle is an important signaling pathway for cell proliferation and differentiation. Despite the existence of nuclear PC metabolism and PC-PLD enzymatic activity in nucleus, mechanisms of the nuclear translocation of PC-PLD have not been clarified. Moreover, in most studies nuclear PLD has been identified only indirectly through overexpression of enzyme that could lead to a distribution of the PLD significantly different from endogenous enzyme. Using immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling, PLD1 has been localized to the nucleus of mammalian cells (GH3 cells), and upon Golgi apparatus collapse in response to brefeldin A, intranuclear staining of PLD1 increased significantly (24Freyberg Z. Sweeney D. Siddhanta A. Bourgoin S. Frohman M. Shields D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The same group has reported that when the Golgi apparatus was disrupted by treatment with brefeldin A, PLD2 translocated to the nucleus, similarly to PLD1 (25Freyberg Z. Bourgoin S. Shields D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3930-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, we could not observe any nuclear translocation of PLD1 by treatment with brefeldin A in HEK293 cells. These discrepancies might be attributable to differences in cell types and/or agonist-activated signaling pathway. The significance of the translocation of PLD isoform from the Golgi apparatus to the nucleus is at present unclear. Others have reported the intranuclear presence of PLD2 in renal carcinoma cells and have suggested this isoform might somehow be involved in tumorigenesis because its amount was very low in the nucleus of normal renal cells (26Zhao Y. Ehara H. Akao Y. Shamoto M. Nakagawa Y. Banno Y. Deguchi T. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although we observed the presence of PLD2 in the nucleus from glioma cells, we could not find the putative NLS motif of PLD2 using the bioinformatic approach. It could be possible that PLD2 might contain nonclassical nuclear localization motif. We have been unable to identify conditions (e.g. growth factors, apoptosis, normal versus transformed phenotype) that might alter the relative distribution of endogenous PLD1 between the cytosolic and nuclear compartments. Although we have disclosed the importance of NLS and its interaction with β-importin in the nuclear localization of PLD1, further study for ligand or condition-induced nuclear translocation of endogenous PLD1 will strengthen the molecular mechanism of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of PLD1 under physiological condition. We have identified a functional and highly conserved NLS required for nuclear import of PLD1. We have recently reported that caspase-mediated cleavage of PLD1 during apoptosis results in production of NF-PLD1 and CF-PLD1. The NLS of PLD1 is located near the caspase cleavage site (Asp-545) (16Jang Y.H. Namkoong S. Kim Y.M. Lee S.J. Park B.J. Min D.S. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1782-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CF-PLD1 containing the functional NLS, but not NF-PLD1 lacking the NLS, is exclusively imported into the nucleus, whereas FL-PLD1 is partially imported into the nucleus. The extent of nuclear localization of CF-PLD1 and FL-PLD1 is different even though these two proteins have the same NLS motif. The amount of FL- or CF-PLD1 translocated into nucleus was correlated with its binding affinity with importin-β. Although we examined relative binding affinity of CF- or FL-PLD1 with importin-β using immunoprecipitation and an GST pulldown assay, future study using purified proteins is required for quantification or kinetics of these binding affinities. Thus, it is possible that CF-PLD1 may easily be exposed to NLS machinery such as importin-β compared with FL-PLD1 and, thus, exclusively localized in the nucleus. In addition, the NLS motif of PLD1 is required for its binding to importin-β. It seems that CF-PLD1 showing no PLD activity may have a function in the nucleus regardless of the enzymatic activity of PLD. Although it is speculated that CF-PLD1 in the nucleus might play a role such as modulation of gene expression, at present we don't know the function for CF-PLD1 in the nucleus. In the future study we will investigate its function deeply using experiments such as microarray. Recent findings showing that nuclear PLD1 in vascular smooth muscle cells is specifically stimulated by heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors but not by receptor tyrosine kinases favor a very specific role for nuclear phospholipid mediators generated by this enzyme, suggesting the emerging role of nuclear localization in PLD1 function, and more importantly, in pathological processes (13Gayral S. Déléris P. Laulagnier K. Laffargue M. Salles J.P. Perret B. Record M. Breton-Douillon M. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that a nuclear PLD1 might regulate specific nuclear signaling pathways. An increase in PLD-generated nuclear DG mass has been reported in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (10Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29843-29847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells (28Martelli A. Bortul R. Bareggi R. Tabellini G. Grill V. Baldini G. Narducci P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3961-3967PubMed Google Scholar), and IIC9 fibroblasts (11Baldassare J.J. Jarpe M.B. Alferes L. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4911-4914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The profiles of the nuclear DG resembled the species profiles of PC but not of inositol lipid species (29Jarpe M.B. Leach K.L. Raben D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our finding that nuclear intact PLD1 mediates the activation of nuclear PKCα and ERK signaling pathways and suppression of its nuclear import abolished the activation of PKCα and ERK in the nucleus is in favor of specific role of nuclear PLD1 signaling pathway. Although CF-PLD1 is exclusively localized in the nucleus, it is not responsible for the activation of PKCα and ERK in the nucleus as well as cytosol, in which PLD activity is involved. Nuclear PKC isozymes are involved in the regulation of biological processes as important as cell proliferation and differentiation, gene expression, neoplastic transformation, and apoptosis (30Martelli A.M. Evangelisti C. Nyakern M. Manzoli F.A. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2006; 1761: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). There is evidence for nuclear translocation of classical PKC isotypes that was mediated by DG produced along PLD pathway (31Neri L.M. Bortul R. Borgatti P. Tabellini G. Baldini G. Capitani S. Martelli A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 947-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that nuclear DG is the attracting force that drives to the nucleus classical PKCs. Activated nuclear PKC has been shown to phosphorylate a number of proteins involved in cell division and appears to be critical for progression through the G1/S (32Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and G2/M checkpoints of the cell cycle (33Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The relocalization of ERK to the nucleus appears to be an important regulatory step for mitogen-induced gene expression and cell cycle reentry. Regulating the accessibility of ERK to the nucleus is a key signaling event by which cells may control the intensity and temporal activation of genes during cell growth and differentiation (34Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouysségur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Downstream signaling in the nucleus is another facet that requires in-depth investigation, because we know very little of the physiological targets of some nuclear lipid second messengers. At present there are little data regarding a possible role played by PA produced by PLD in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm PA has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by inducing actin polymerization and formation of stress fibers. Moreover, PA can activate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, increasing the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (35Cockcroft S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, actin may be one of the most important constituents of the nuclear matrix (36Pederson T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), whereas phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase is present in the speckle domains of the nucleus (11Baldassare J.J. Jarpe M.B. Alferes L. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4911-4914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 37Tabellini G. Bortul R. Santi S. Riccio M. Baldini G. Cappellini A. Billi A.M. Berezney R. Ruggeri A. Cocco L. Martelli A.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 287: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which have been implicated in pre-mRNA processing (27Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3547-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Because type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase activity is stimulated by PA (35Cockcroft S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is suggested that nuclear PLD1 might function in mRNA processing via regulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate synthesis. Additionally, because periodic S phase accumulation of DG from either PC-derived PA or phosphatidylinositol is essential for continued cell growth/division, nuclear PLD1-derived-PA might regulate the cell cycle (6Hunt A.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, in the future it will be of fundamental importance to investigate the role of PA generated within the nucleus. NLS of PLD1 and its interaction with importin-β provide new insights into nuclear localization of PLD1 and its nuclear signaling. Further clarification and extension of our proposal will come from the study of signal-dependent nuclear translocation of PLD1. In addition, future identification of the physiological roles of nuclear PLD1 or CF-PLD1 will shed light on nuclear PLD1-mediated signaling function."

Here, we show that L-PGDS and arrestin-3 (Arr3) interact directly and can be co-immunoprecipitated endogenously from MG-63 osteoblasts. Perinuclear L-PGDS/Arr3 co-localization is observed in PGD(2)-producing MG-63 cells and is induced by the addition of the L-PGDS substrate or co-expression of COX-2 in HEK293 cells. Inhibition of L-PGDS activity in MG-63 cells triggers redistribution of Arr3 and L-PGDS to the cytoplasm. Perinuclear localization of L-PGDS is detected in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) but is more diffused in MEFs-arr-2(-/-)-arr-3(-/-). Arrestin-3 promotes PGD(2) production by L-PGDS in vitro. IL-1β-induced PGD(2) production is significantly lower in MEFs-arr-2(-/-)-arr-3(-/-) than in wild-type MEFs but can be rescued by expressing Arr2 or Arr3. A peptide corresponding to amino acids 86-100 of arrestin-3 derived from its L-PGDS binding domain stimulates L-PGDS-mediated PGD(2) production in vitro and in MG-63 cells. We report the first characterization of an interactor/modulator of a PGD(2) synthase and the identification of a new function for arrestin, which may open new opportunities for improving therapies for the treatment of inflammatory diseases."
