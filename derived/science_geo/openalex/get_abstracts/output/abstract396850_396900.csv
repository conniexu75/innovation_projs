https://openalex.org/W2046013132,"Transcription factor-based cellular reprogramming has opened the way to converting somatic cells to a pluripotent state, but has faced limitations resulting from the requirement for transcription factors and the relative inefficiency of the process. We show here that expression of the miR302/367 cluster rapidly and efficiently reprograms mouse and human somatic cells to an iPSC state without a requirement for exogenous transcription factors. This miRNA-based reprogramming approach is two orders of magnitude more efficient than standard Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/Myc-mediated methods. Mouse and human miR302/367 iPSCs display similar characteristics to Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/Myc-iPSCs, including pluripotency marker expression, teratoma formation, and, for mouse cells, chimera contribution and germline contribution. We found that miR367 expression is required for miR302/367-mediated reprogramming and activates Oct4 gene expression, and that suppression of Hdac2 is also required. Thus, our data show that miRNA and Hdac-mediated pathways can cooperate in a powerful way to reprogram somatic cells to pluripotency.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI4ZjQ2OTBmMDY1YTBjOGVlYjdkOTI0NWZlNGVkYzA5MCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3OTc3ODkxfQ.dbKbsGf3Tt9wpqwsR2YK4MVriDUBB0Fy9_GheRxv7pJ0rKbu39d7cVr_lHP_Wbj8xMOOs20MeWQXDfoZabA9zX7HHB88NBkCLZXICckJx43j3Wa7a78lmwk446cKLHR1otWsHddTold7WzmDh8ISMNFL7b67z3RrrrLYOnXxivRw0SBv9YtdSGEAilINYED8PU4_ycTg6Sag7Gq92rsqvXqFUWB8SWVJgRWZzbgzyQ5T5h6TT23b6XFQvLOPMNiu_NuqoFwgRwKByUHudZ6RlWYKS2u2E8p1ZHqG7S21C9jv5D3kURFecyEL12lmv4c4x6ZtLY8e8Vaccs2eQsnStg(mp4, (10.95 MB) Download video"

https://openalex.org/W2146040216,"Despite the high prevalence and poor outcome of patients with metastatic lung cancer the mechanisms of tumour progression and metastasis remain largely uncharacterized. Here we modelled human lung adenocarcinoma, which frequently harbours activating point mutations in KRAS and inactivation of the p53 pathway, using conditional alleles in mice. Lentiviral-mediated somatic activation of oncogenic Kras and deletion of p53 in the lung epithelial cells of Kras(LSL-G12D/+);p53(flox/flox) mice initiates lung adenocarcinoma development. Although tumours are initiated synchronously by defined genetic alterations, only a subset becomes malignant, indicating that disease progression requires additional alterations. Identification of the lentiviral integration sites allowed us to distinguish metastatic from non-metastatic tumours and determine the gene expression alterations that distinguish these tumour types. Cross-species analysis identified the NK2-related homeobox transcription factor Nkx2-1 (also called Ttf-1 or Titf1) as a candidate suppressor of malignant progression. In this mouse model, Nkx2-1 negativity is pathognomonic of high-grade poorly differentiated tumours. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in cells derived from metastatic and non-metastatic tumours demonstrated that Nkx2-1 controls tumour differentiation and limits metastatic potential in vivo. Interrogation of Nkx2-1-regulated genes, analysis of tumours at defined developmental stages, and functional complementation experiments indicate that Nkx2-1 constrains tumours in part by repressing the embryonically restricted chromatin regulator Hmga2. Whereas focal amplification of NKX2-1 in a fraction of human lung adenocarcinomas has focused attention on its oncogenic function, our data specifically link Nkx2-1 downregulation to loss of differentiation, enhanced tumour seeding ability and increased metastatic proclivity. Thus, the oncogenic and suppressive functions of Nkx2-1 in the same tumour type substantiate its role as a dual function lineage factor."
https://openalex.org/W1983517713,"Cell therapy can improve cardiac function in animals and humans after injury, but the mechanism is unclear. We performed cell therapy experiments in genetically engineered mice that permanently express green fluorescent protein (GFP) only in cardiomyocytes after a pulse of 4-OH-tamoxifen. Myocardial infarction diluted the GFP(+) cardiomyocyte pool, indicating refreshment by non-GFP(+) progenitors. Cell therapy with bone marrow-derived c-kit(+) cells, but not mesenchymal stem cells, further diluted the GFP(+) pool, consistent with c-kit(+) cell-mediated augmentation of cardiomyocyte progenitor activity. This effect could not be explained by transdifferentiation to cardiomyocytes by exogenously delivered c-kit(+) cells or by cell fusion. Therapy with c-kit(+) cells but not mesenchymal stem cells improved cardiac function. These findings suggest that stimulation of endogenous cardiogenic progenitor activity is a critical mechanism of cardiac cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2165805414,"Molecular targeting of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has therapeutic potential for efficient treatment of cancer, although relatively few specific targets have been identified so far. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) was recently shown to regulate the tumorigenic capacity of glioma stem cells under hypoxic conditions. Surprisingly, we found that, under normoxia, HIF1α signaling was selectively activated in the stem cells of mouse lymphoma and human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). HIF1a shRNA and HIF inhibitors abrogated the colony-forming unit (cfu) activity of mouse lymphoma and human AML CSCs. Importantly, the HIF-inhibitor echinomycin efficiently eradicated mouse lymphoma and serially transplantable human AML in xenogeneic models by preferential elimination of CSCs. Hif1α maintains mouse lymphoma CSCs by repressing a negative feedback loop in the Notch pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrate an essential function of Hif1α-Notch interaction in maintaining CSCs and provide an effective approach to target CSCs for therapy of hematological malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2028164935,"During the past few decades, several new classes of superconductors have been discovered. Most of these do not appear to be related to traditional superconductors. As a consequence, it is felt by many that for these materials, superconductivity arises from a different source than the electron-ion interactions that are at the heart of conventional superconductivity. Developing a rigorous theory for any of these classes of materials has proven to be a difficult challenge, and will continue to be one of the major problems in physics in the decades to come."

Human cord blood (hCB) transplantation has emerged as an attractive alternative treatment option when traditional HSC sources are unavailable; however, the absolute number of hCB HSCs transplanted is significantly lower than bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (MPBSCs). We previously demonstrated that dimethyl-prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2) increased HSCs in vertebrate models. Here, we describe preclinical analyses of the therapeutic potential of dmPGE2 treatment by using human and nonhuman primate HSCs. dmPGE2 significantly increased total human hematopoietic colony formation in vitro and enhanced engraftment of unfractionated and CD34(+) hCB after xenotransplantation. In nonhuman primate autologous transplantation, dmPGE2-treated CD34(+) MPBSCs showed stable multilineage engraftment over 1 year postinfusion. Together, our analyses indicated that dmPGE2 mediates conserved responses in HSCs from human and nonhuman primates and provided sufficient preclinical information to support proceeding to an FDA-approved phase 1 clinical trial."

Trailing behind the cuprates, these iron-based compounds are the second–highest-temperature superconducting material family known to date. Despite the marked differences in the chemical composition, these materials share many properties with the cuprates and offer the hope of finally unveiling the secret of high-temperature superconductivity. The main theme of this review is the electron-pairing mechanism responsible for their superconductivity. We discuss the progress in this young field and point out the open issues."
https://openalex.org/W1964076580,"Understanding the basis of the unrestricted multilineage differentiation potential of pluripotent cells will be of developmental and translational consequence. We propose that pluripotency transcription factors are lineage specifiers that direct commitment to specific fetal lineages. Individual factors bestow the ability to differentiate into particular cell types, and concomitant expression of multiple lineage specifiers within pluripotent cells enables differentiation into every fetal lineage. Moreover, we speculate that, rather than being an intrinsically stable ""ground state,"" pluripotency is an inherently precarious condition in which rival lineage specifiers continually compete to specify differentiation along mutually exclusive lineages."

https://openalex.org/W2128979893,"Regulatory mechanisms governing the sequence from progenitor cell proliferation to neuronal migration during corticogenesis are poorly understood. Here we report that phosphorylation of DISC1, a major susceptibility factor for several mental disorders, acts as a molecular switch from maintaining proliferation of mitotic progenitor cells to activating migration of postmitotic neurons in mice. Unphosphorylated DISC1 regulates canonical Wnt signalling via an interaction with GSK3β, whereas specific phosphorylation at serine 710 (S710) triggers the recruitment of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) proteins to the centrosome. In support of this model, loss of BBS1 leads to defects in migration, but not proliferation, whereas DISC1 knockdown leads to deficits in both. A phospho-dead mutant can only rescue proliferation, whereas a phospho-mimic mutant rescues exclusively migration defects. These data highlight a dual role for DISC1 in corticogenesis and indicate that phosphorylation of this protein at S710 activates a key developmental switch."

In the present study, we sought to evaluate the role of SMO-G(i) coupling in fibroblast migration induced by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh). Our results demonstrate an absolute requirement for G(i) in Shh-induced fibroblast migration. We found that Shh acutely stimulates the small Rho GTPases Rac1 and RhoA via SMO through a G(i) protein- and PI3K-dependent mechanism, and that these are required for cell migration. These responses were independent of transcription by Gli and of the C-terminal domain of SMO, as we show using a combination of molecular and genetic tools. Our findings provide a mechanistic model for fibroblast migration in response to Shh and underscore the role of SMO-G(i) coupling in non-canonical Hh signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1983151538,"Variations in the light environment require higher plants to regulate the light harvesting process. Under high light a mechanism known as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is triggered to dissipate excess absorbed light energy within the photosystem II (PSII) antenna as heat, preventing photodamage to the reaction center. The major component of NPQ, known as qE, is rapidly reversible in the dark and dependent upon the transmembrane proton gradient (ΔpH), formed as a result of photosynthetic electron transport. Using diaminodurene and phenazine metasulfate, mediators of cyclic electron flow around photosystem I, to enhance ΔpH, it is demonstrated that rapidly reversible qE-type quenching can be observed in intact chloroplasts from Arabidopsis plants lacking the PsbS protein, previously believed to be indispensible for the process. The qE in chloroplasts lacking PsbS significantly quenched the level of fluorescence when all PSII reaction centers were in the open state (Fo state), protected PSII reaction centers from photoinhibition, was modulated by zeaxanthin and was accompanied by the qE-typical absorption spectral changes, known as ΔA535. Titrations of the ΔpH dependence of qE in the absence of PsbS reveal that this protein affects the cooperativity and sensitivity of the photoprotective process to protons. The roles of PsbS and zeaxanthin are discussed in light of their involvement in the control of the proton-antenna association constant, pK, via regulation of the interconnected phenomena of PSII antenna reorganization/aggregation and hydrophobicity.

The Sabatier principle of maximizing catalytic activity by optimizing the adsorption energy of the substrate molecule could offer pivotal guidance to otherwise random screenings. Here we show that the chemical shift value of an adsorbate (formic acid) on metal colloid catalysts measured by (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in aqueous suspension constitutes a simple experimental descriptor for adsorption strength. Avoiding direct contact between the (13)C atom and the metal surface eliminates peak broadening that has confounded prior efforts to establish such correlations. The data can guide rational design of improved catalysts, as demonstrated here for the cases of formic acid decomposition and formic acid electro-oxidation reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2103886186,"During the early development of the nervous system, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor (GABA(A)R)-mediated signaling parallels the neurotrophin/tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk)-dependent signaling in controlling a number of processes from cell proliferation and migration, via dendritic and axonal outgrowth, to synapse formation and plasticity. Here we present the first evidence that these two signaling systems regulate each other through a complex positive feedback mechanism. We first demonstrate that GABA(A)R activation leads to an increase in the cell surface expression of these receptors in cultured embryonic cerebrocortical neurons, specifically at the stage when this activity causes depolarization of the plasma membrane and Ca(2+) influx through L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. We further demonstrate that GABA(A)R activity triggers release of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which, in turn by activating TrkB receptors, mediates the observed increase in cell surface expression of GABA(A)Rs. This BDNF/TrkB-dependent increase in surface levels of GABA(A)Rs requires the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase C (PKC) and does not involve the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activity. The increase in GABA(A)R surface levels occurs due to an inhibition of the receptor endocytosis by BDNF, whereas the receptor reinsertion into the plasma membrane remains unaltered. Thus, GABA(A)R activity is a potent regulator of the BDNF release during neuronal development, and at the same time, it is strongly enhanced by the activity of the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/PKC signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2010808387,"Modification of the membrane lipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) of Staphylococcus aureus by enzymatic transfer of a l-lysine residue leading to lysyl-PG converts the net charge of PG from −1 to +1 and is thought to confer resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Lysyl-PG synthesis and translocation to the outer leaflet of the bacterial membrane are achieved by the membrane protein MprF. Consequently, mutants lacking a functional mprF gene are in particular vulnerable to the action of AMPs. Hence, we aim at elucidating whether and to which extent lysyl-PG modulates membrane binding, insertion, and permeabilization by various AMPs. Lysyl-PG was incorporated into artificial lipid bilayers, mimicking the cytoplasmic membrane of S. aureus. Moreover, we determined the activity of the peptides against a clinical isolate of S. aureus strain SA113 and two mutants lacking a functional mprF gene and visualized peptide-induced ultrastructural changes of bacteria by transmission electron microscopy. The studied peptides were: (i) NK-2, an α-helical fragment of mammalian NK-lysin, (ii) arenicin-1, a lugworm β-sheet peptide, and (iii) bee venom melittin. Biophysical data obtained by FRET spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and electrical measurements with planar lipid bilayers were correlated with the biological activities of the peptides. They strongly support the hypothesis that peptide-membrane interactions are a prerequisite for eradication of S. aureus. However, degree and mode of modulation of membrane properties such as fluidity, capacitance, and conductivity were unique for each of the peptides.

Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6852) Google Scholar). They have a positive net charge, are 20–40 amino acid residues in length, and exhibit an amphipathic secondary structure. These features enable the interaction and permeabilization of bacterial membranes. The disturbance of the bacterial membrane may be the lethal hit itself or may allow the entrance of the peptides to reach secondary intracellular targets (2Brogden K.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4462) Google Scholar). Due to their unique mode of action, AMPs have gained high interest as new drugs to overcome bacterial resistance to classical antibiotics (3Hancock R.E. Sahl H.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (3154) Google Scholar). The primary target of AMPs is the cell membrane of bacteria. It is widely accepted that the negatively charged bacterial surface plays a major role in the attraction of the cationic peptides. Biophysical studies demonstrated explicitly that model membranes consisting of anionic lipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG), are particularly vulnerable to AMPs, whereas membranes of the eukaryotic zwitterionic phospholipid lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) are refractory to the peptides (4Matsuzaki K.

The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is among the bacteria that are difficult to treat, particularly by cationic antibiotics and AMPs (14Peschel A. Jack R.W. Otto M. Collins L.V. Staubitz P. Nicholson G. Kalbacher H. Nieuwenhuizen W.F. Jung G. Tarkowski A. van Kessel K.P. van Strijp J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 15Nishi H. Komatsuzawa H. Fujiwara T. McCallum N. Sugai M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4800-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This has been attributed partially to the modification of PG in the cytoplasmic membrane of S. aureus by the addition of a l-lysine residue, leading to lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (lysyl-PG) (14Peschel A. Jack R.W. Otto M. Collins L.V. Staubitz P. Nicholson G. Kalbacher H. Nieuwenhuizen W.F. Jung G. Tarkowski A. van Kessel K.P. van Strijp J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). This reaction modifies the net charge of PG from −1 to +1 and hence should impair the initial electrostatic interaction of the cationic peptides with the bacterial membrane. The lipid portion of the cytoplasmic membrane of S. aureus is composed of PG and cardiolipin (16Ward J.B. Perkins H.R. Biochem. J. 1968; 106: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Short S.A. White D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 219-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been estimated that one-third of PG in the membrane is modified by lysine. PG lysinylation is achieved by the membrane protein multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF), which consists of a lysyl-PG synthase domain (18Staubitz P. Neumann H. Schneider T. Wiedemann I. Peschel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 231: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) transferring lysine from lysyl-tRNA to PG and a lysyl-PG translocase, which facilitates flipping of lysyl-PG to the outer membrane leaflet (19Ernst C.M.

S. aureus strains with deletion or mutations in the mprF gene exhibited an attenuated virulence and were more sensitive to the action of various antimicrobial peptides such as human α-defensin HNP-1, protegrins, tachyplesin 1, nisin, magainin-2-amide (14Peschel A. Jack R.W. Otto M. Collins L.V. Staubitz P. Nicholson G. Kalbacher H. Nieuwenhuizen W.F. Jung G. Tarkowski A. van Kessel K.P. van Strijp J.A. J. Exp.

Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4800-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) but also to positively charged antibiotics such as gentamicin (15Nishi H. Komatsuzawa H. Fujiwara T. McCallum N. Sugai M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4800-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mprF also plays a significant role in the induction of clinically relevant daptomycin resistance of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (20Mishra N.N. Yang S.J. Sawa A. Rubio A. Nast C.C. Yeaman M.R. Bayer A.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 2312-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The same mechanism has also been found in other bacterial pathogens. A mutant strain of Bacillus anthracis with the deletion of a homologue gene to mprF was rendered highly susceptible to the cationic peptides protamine, LL-37, and HNP-1 (21Samant S. Hsu F.F. Neyfakh A.A. Lee H. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1311-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Despite the significance of MprF-mediated resistance of S. aureus to AMPs and the fact that its mechanism involves the modification of a membrane lipid, up to now, information about artificial membranes containing lysyl-PG (or a chemically related substitute) and their interaction with AMPs is very scarce. Danner et al. (22Danner S. Pabst G. Lohner K. Hickel A. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 2150-2159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) described the physico-chemical properties of the pure lipid lysyl-DPPG. To study the interaction of AMPs with membranes, octadecylamine has been used as a mimetic for lysyl-PG (23Xiong Y.Q. Mukhopadhyay K. Yeaman M.R. Adler-Moore J. Bayer A.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 3114-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and very recently, surface association and membrane permeabilization by a synthetic peptide modeled on the basis of mammalian platelet factor 4 with liposomes comprising lysyl-PG have been investigated (24Kilelee E.

Here we aim at elucidating the significance and effects of a partial substitution of PG by lysyl-PG in model membranes, to mimic the cytoplasmic membrane of bacterial strains expressing or lacking the functional MprF protein, on the interaction with representative AMPs. The studied peptides were well characterized and exhibit profound activities against a clinical isolate of S. aureus (see Table 1). They represent three different classes of AMPs regarding structure and target selectivity. (i) Peptide NK-2 is an internal fragment of mammalian NK-lysin. It is active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but rather non-toxic to human cells (25Andrä J. Leippe M. Med. Microbiol.

NK11 is an almost inactive shortened variant of NK-2 and serves as an inactive control peptide (26Andrä J. Monreal D. Martinez de Tejada G. Olak C. Brezesinski G. Sanchez Gomez S. Goldmann T.

Substitution of the non-functional cysteine residue of NK-2 at position 7 by a serine (C7S, NK27) or alanine residue (C7A) was performed to reduce sensitivity of the peptide to oxidation while maintaining its overall structural and physico-chemical properties. Peptide C7S was formerly referred to as NK27 (26Andrä J. Monreal D. Martinez de Tejada G. Olak C. Brezesinski G. Sanchez Gomez S. Goldmann T. Bartels R. Brandenburg K. Moriyon I. J. Biol.

(ii) Arenicin-1 is a β-sheet peptide that has been isolated from immune cells of the lugworm (27Ovchinnikova T.V. Aleshina G.M. Balandin S.V. Krasnosdembskaya A.D. Markelov M.L. Frolova E.I.

Its N and C termini are linked via an intramolecular disulfide bond. Arenicin-1 exhibits outstanding activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It is non-hemolytic and very stable against tryptic digest. Moreover, it is particularly insensitive toward high salt concentration (10Andrä J. Jakovkin I. Grötzinger J. Hecht O.

In addition to the natural peptide, we used a linear form where two terminal cysteine residues have been replaced by serine (C/S-Ar-1) (28Andrä J. Hammer M.U. Grötzinger J. Jakovkin I. Lindner B. Vollmer E. Fedders H. Leippe M. Gutsmann T. Biol. Chem. 2009; 390: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). (iii) Melittin is an α-helical hemolytic peptide from bee venom (29Habermann E. Jentsch J. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1967; 348: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar).

Biophysical data were then correlated with the capability of the peptides to affect the viability and structural integrity of a clinical isolate of S. aureus (35Leippe M. Andrä J. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 2602-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and of wild type SA113 as well as of two SA113-derived strains lacking a functional mprF gene (19Ernst C.M. Staubitz P.

Peptides were synthesized either with a free carboxyl group or with an amidated C terminus by the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase peptide synthesis technique on an automatic peptide synthesizer (model 433 A; Applied Biosystems) as described previously (28Andrä J.

Disulfide linkage of terminal cysteine residues was performed in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as described (28Andrä J. Hammer M.U. Grötzinger J. Jakovkin I. Lindner B. Vollmer E. Fedders H. Leippe M. Gutsmann T. Biol. Chem. 2009; 390: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Peptide stocks (1 mm) in 0.01% TFA were stored at −20 °C. Synthetic phospholipids 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (DPPG), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(3-lysyl(1-glycerol))] (lysyl-DPPG), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (DOPG), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(3-lysyl(1-glycerol))] (lysyl-DOPG), as well as natural l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and l-α-phosphatidylglycerol (PG), both from Escherichia coli were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Fluorescently labeled phospholipids N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4yl)-phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE) and N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine (rhodamine-PE) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Lipid stock solutions were prepared in chloroform. All lysyl-PG solutions were used immediately. We used a clinical isolate of S. aureus (35Leippe M. Andrä J. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 2602-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), as well as wild type SA113 (ATCC 35556), a SA113-derived strain lacking the complete mprF gene (ΔmprF), and one ΔmprF-derived strain expressing only the synthase domain of MprF but lacking the translocase domain (ΔmprFpRBsyn) (19Ernst C.M.

Bacteria were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) composed of 1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl under constant shaking at 37 °C and subsequently inoculated in the same medium to reach the mid-exponential phase. Peptides were diluted from stock solutions at the desired concentration in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, with or without an additional 150 mm NaCl), and 180 μl of these solutions were filled into the wells of the first row of a microtiter plate. For a 2-fold serial dilution, 90 μl of each peptide solution were transferred to the well in the next row, which was filled with 90 μl of buffer before. Subsequently, a suspension of exponential phase bacteria in LB was added (10 μl, containing 104 cfu) to the peptide solution (90 μl). The constantly shaken plates were incubated in a wet chamber overnight at 37 °C. Bacterial growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 620 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Rainbow, Tecan, Crailsham, Germany). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest peptide concentration at which no bacterial growth was measurable. Portions of each well (10 μl) were diluted with buffer and plated out in duplicates on LB-agar plates. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, bacterial colonies were counted. The minimal bactericidal concentration was defined as the lowest peptide concentration at which no colony growth was observed. Transmission electron microscopy was performed as described previously in detail (26Andrä J. Monreal D. Martinez de Tejada G. Olak C. Brezesinski G. Sanchez Gomez S. Goldmann T. Bartels R. Brandenburg K. Moriyon I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14719-14728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Bacteria (5 × 108 cfu/ml) were incubated with indicated concentrations of peptides in buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) supplemented with 10% LB medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Images shown are representative for the respective sample. Lipids dissolved in chloroform were dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The resulting lipid film was dispersed in buffer (see under “FRET and FTIR Spectroscopy”), sonicated for 30 min, and subjected to 3–4 temperature cycles from 4 to 60 °C with an incubation period of 30 min at each step. Lipid dispersions were stored at 4 °C overnight before use. Intercalation of peptides into liposome membranes was determined in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C by FRET spectroscopy applied as a probe dilution assay (37Schromm A.B. Brandenburg K. Rietschel E.T. Flad H.D. Carroll S.F. Seydel U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Peptides were added to liposomes, which were labeled with 1% of the donor NBD-PE and 1% of the acceptor rhodamine-PE. NBD excitation wavelength was 470 nm. Intercalation was monitored as the increase of the ratio of the donor fluorescence intensity IDonor at 531 nm to that of the acceptor intensity IAcceptor at 593 nm in dependence on time. This ratio depends on the Förster efficiency; therefore, a rising value means that the mean distance separation of donor and acceptor dyes is rising. The infrared spectroscopic measurements were performed on an IFS-55 spectrometer (Bruker). Pure lipids dispersed in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, as well as lipids mixed with peptides solubilized in the same buffer in a molar ratio of 1:0.3, were placed in a CaF2 cuvette with a 12.5-μm Teflon spacer. Consecutive heating and cooling scans were performed automatically between 10 and 70 °C with a heating rate of 0.6 °C/min. Every 3 °C, 50 interferograms were accumulated, apodized, Fourier transformed, and converted to absorbance spectra. The peak position of the asymmetric methylene stretching vibration was plotted versus temperature. Phase transition temperatures were derived by determination of the maximum (minimum) of the first derivative of the heating (cooling) scans. Planar bilayers were prepared according to the Montal-Mueller technique (38Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) as described earlier (39Wiese A. Seydel U. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 145: 355-370PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, symmetric and asymmetric bilayers were formed by opposing two lipid monolayers, prepared in separated compartments on aqueous subphases from chloroformic solutions of the lipids, at a small aperture (∼150 μm) in a thin Teflon septum (thickness 25 μm). The inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane of S. aureus was reconstituted by a phospholipid mixture consisting of an equimolar ratio of PE and PG. For electrical measurements, planar membranes were voltage-clamped via a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes (type IVM E-255, Science Products, Hofheim, Germany) connected to the headstage of an L/M-PCA patch clamp amplifier (List-Medical, Darmstadt, Germany). In all experiments, the compartment to which peptide was added is indicated first, and the compartment opposite to the addition was grounded. In comparison with the natural system, a positive clamp voltage represents a membrane with negative potential on the inside. All measurements were performed at a temperature of 37 °C in 5 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0. Two electrical parameters were determined: (i) peptide-induced changes of the membrane capacitance and (ii) current through peptide-induced lesions. Assuming a plate capacitor model, the membrane capacitance yields information about the area, thickness, and composition of the bilayer. Using small positive and negative jumps of the clamp voltage, the maximum voltage required to determine membrane capacitance is <1 mV. Therefore, peptide membrane interaction can be investigated without the influence of a significant external voltage. This method allows the determination of changes in membrane capacitance with a precision of <1 picofarad. The diameter (d, nm) of pores or lesions induced by the AMPs was calculated under the assumption of a membrane of 6-nm thickness and a cylindrical pore structure using the following formula: d = 2*√(L*(6/πσ), with L = measured conductivity and σ = buffer conductivity. We determined the capability of synthetic cationic peptides (Table 1) to inhibit the growth (MIC) and to kill various strains of S. aureus (minimal bactericidal concentration). Strains with a functional mprF gene, i.e. wild type SA113 and a clinical isolate, were considerably less sensitive to the action of the peptides. Deletion of the mprF gene (ΔmprF) rendered SA113 into a highly susceptible strain. A strain with a rescued synthase activity but still lacking the translocase domain (ΔmprFpRBsyn) was undistinguishable from strain ΔmprF, providing strong evidence that exposure of lysyl-PG to the environment is essential for conferring resistance to antimicrobial peptides. The activity of melittin was only marginally affected by the lysine modification of PG. Among the other peptides tested, arenicin was the most effective. Moreover, the activity of arenicin-1 was most strongly modulated by the expression of lysyl-PG. NK-2 was of moderate activity against strains with a functional mprF gene. NK11 was almost completely inactive. To elucidate the structure/function relationship of peptide NK-2 for an anti-S. aureus activity, we tested derivatives with the sole cysteine residue substituted by serine (C7S/NK27) or alanine (C7A) residues as well as three peptides with deletions of four adjacent residues close to the N terminus (NK23a), in the center of the molecule (NK23b), and close to the C terminus of NK-2 (NK23c). Substitution of the cysteine residue improved the activity in particular against the clinical isolate. Deletion of the central residues considerably reduced the antibacterial activity, whereas deletion of C-terminal residues led to an enhancement of activity. The direct influence of peptides on the structural integrity of S. aureus (clinical isolate) was visualized by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1). Moreover, aliquots of peptide-treated bacteria were plated out on LB-agar plates, and colonies grown overnight were counted. Upon a 30-min incubation of S. aureus with peptides at the indicated concentrations, 80–100% of bacteria were killed, with the exception of NK11, where all bacteria survived. Peptide concentrations were chosen based on their MIC data (Table 1) to obtain a comparable killing rate. It is apparent that all peptides (except NK11, Fig. 1D) elicited morphological changes of S. aureus; however, the characteristics of structural changes were unique for each family of peptides. NK-2- and C7S-treated bacteria exhibited higher electron density in the cytoplasm than control bacteria with areas of very low electron density attached to the membrane, suggesting peptide-induced release of cytoplasmic material (Fig. 1, B and C). Bacteria incubated with melittin showed a heterogeneous electron density in the cytoplasm, and also, extracellular material emerging from the cell membrane. S. aureus incubated with arenicin peptides had a frayed surface (Fig. 1, F and H), an effect that was not observed for the linear derivative C/S-Ar-1 lacking the disulfide bond (Fig. 1G). It appeared just as if these peptides dissolve membrane components from the bacteria or promote the release of intracellular material. NK-2, melittin, Ar-1, and the most interesting derivatives were selected for an in-depth biophysical investigation with artificial membrane systems. The lipid compositions of these model systems mirrored the cytoplasmic membrane lipid composition of the various S. aureus strains. The membrane mimetic of wild type SA113 strain was composed of a mixture of negatively charged PG and positively charged lysyl-PG. The artificial membrane mimicking the mutant strain lacking the mprF gene, and thus lacking lysyl-PG in the membrane, was composed of PG alone. For the formation of planar lipid bilayers, it was necessary to dilute PG and lysyl-PG into 50% of zwitterionic PE. The fatty acid comp"

Whereas several saccharide uptake systems are shared between the different phylogenetic kingdoms, the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system exists almost exclusively in bacteria. This multi-component system includes an integral membrane protein EIIC that transports saccharides and assists in their phosphorylation. Here we present the crystal structure of an EIIC from Bacillus cereus that transports diacetylchitobiose. The EIIC is a homodimer, with an expansive interface formed between the amino-terminal halves of the two protomers. The carboxy-terminal half of each protomer has a large binding pocket that contains a diacetylchitobiose, which is occluded from both sides of the membrane with its site of phosphorylation near the conserved His250 and Glu334 residues. The structure shows the architecture of this important class of transporters, identifies the determinants of substrate binding and phosphorylation, and provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of sugar translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1973349931,"Appropriate termination of regenerative processes is critical for producing the correct number of cells in tissues. Here we provide evidence for an end-product inhibition of dopamine neuron regeneration that is mediated by dopamine. Ablation of midbrain dopamine neurons leads to complete regeneration in salamanders. Regeneration involves extensive neurogenesis and requires activation of quiescent ependymoglia cells, which express dopamine receptors. Pharmacological compensation for dopamine loss by L-dopa inhibits ependymoglia proliferation and regeneration in a dopamine receptor-signaling-dependent manner, specifically after ablation of dopamine neurons. Systemic administration of the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol alone causes ependymoglia proliferation and the appearance of excessive number of neurons. Our data show that stem cell quiescence is under dopamine control and provide a model for termination once normal homeostasis is restored. The findings establish a role for dopamine in the reversible suppression of neurogenesis in the midbrain and have implications for regenerative strategies in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2010522614,"Wilms’ tumor (WT), the most frequent renal solid tumor in children, has been linked to aberrant Wnt signaling. Herein, we demonstrate that different WTs can be grouped according to either sensitivity or resistance to an antibody (Ab) specific to frizzled7 (FZD7), a Wnt receptor. In the FZD7-sensitive WT phenotype, the Ab induced cell death of the FZD7+ fraction, which in turn depleted primary WT cultures of their clonogenic and sphere-forming cells and decreased in vivo proliferation and survival on xenografting to the chick chorio-allantoic-membrane. In contrast, FZD7-resistant WT in which no cell death was induced showed a different intra-cellular route of the Ab-FZD7 complex compared with sensitive tumors and accumulation of β-catenin. This coincided with a low sFRP1 and DKK1 (Wnt inhibitors) expression pattern, restored epigenetically with de-methylating agents, and lack of β-catenin or WTX mutations. The addition of exogenous DKK1 and sFRP1 to the tumor cells enabled the sensitization of FZD7-resistant WT to the FZD7 Ab. Finally, although extremely difficult to achieve because of dynamic cellular localization of FZD7, sorting of FZD7+ cells from resistant WT, showed them to be highly clonogenic/proliferative, overexpressing WT ‘stemness’ genes, emphasizing the importance of targeting this fraction. FZD7 Ab therapy alone or in combination with Wnt pathway antagonists may have a significant role in the treatment of WT via targeting of a tumor progenitor population."

https://openalex.org/W2088147070,"The IκB kinase (IKK) complex regulates activation of NF-κB, a critical transcription factor in mediating inflammatory and immune responses. Not surprisingly, therefore, many viruses seek to inhibit NF-κB activation. The vaccinia virus B14 protein contributes to virus virulence by binding to the IKKβ subunit of the IKK complex and preventing NF-κB activation in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Previous crystallographic studies showed that the B14 protein has a Bcl-2-like fold and forms homodimers in the crystal. However, multi-angle light scattering indicated that B14 is in monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution. This transient self-association suggested that the hydrophobic dimerization interface of B14 might also mediate its interaction with IKKβ, and this was investigated by introducing amino acid substitutions on the dimer interface. One mutant (Y35E) was entirely monomeric but still co-immunoprecipitated with IKKβ and blocked both NF-κB nuclear translocation and NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Therefore, B14 homodimerization is nonessential for binding and inhibition of IKKβ. In contrast, a second monomeric mutant (F130K) neither bound IKKβ nor inhibited NF-κB-dependent gene expression, demonstrating that this residue is required for the B14-IKKβ interaction. Thus, the dimerization and IKKβ-binding interfaces overlap and lie on a surface used for protein-protein interactions in many viral and cellular Bcl-2-like proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1971391221,"Potassium channels encoded by the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) contribute to cardiac repolarization as a result of their characteristic gating properties. The hERG channel N terminus acts as a crucial determinant in gating. It is also known that the S4-S5 linker couples the voltage-sensing machinery to the channel gate. Moreover, this linker has been repeatedly proposed as an interaction site for the distal portion of the N terminus controlling channel gating, but direct evidence for such an interaction is still lacking. In this study, we used disulfide bond formation between pairs of engineered cysteines to demonstrate the close proximity between the beginning of the N terminus and the S4-S5 linker. Currents from channels with introduced cysteines were rapidly and strongly attenuated by an oxidizing agent, this effect being maximal for cysteine pairs located around amino acids 3 and 542 of the hERG sequence. The state-dependent modification of the double-mutant channels, but not the single-cysteine mutants, and the ability to readily reverse modification with the reducing agent dithiothreitol indicate that a disulfide bond is formed under oxidizing conditions, locking the channels in a non-conducting state. We conclude that physical interactions between the N-terminal-most segment of the N terminus and the S4-S5 linker constitute an essential component of the hERG gating machinery, thus providing a molecular basis for previous data and indicating an important contribution of these cytoplasmic domains in controlling its unusual gating and hence determining its physiological role in setting the electrical behavior of cardiac and other cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2008506448,"Three distinct editosomes, typified by mutually exclusive KREN1, KREN2, or KREN3 endonucleases, are essential for mitochondrial RNA editing in Trypanosoma brucei. The three editosomes differ in substrate endoribonucleolytic cleavage specificity, which may reflect the vast number of editing sites that need insertion or deletion of uridine nucleotides (Us). Each editosome requires the single RNase III domain in each endonuclease for catalysis. Studies reported here show that the editing endonucleases do not form homodimeric domains, and may therefore function as intermolecular heterodimers, perhaps with KREPB4 and/or KREPB5. Editosomes isolated via TAP tag fused to KREPB6, KREPB7, or KREPB8 have a common set of 12 proteins. In addition, KREN3 is only found in KREPB6 editosomes, KREN2 is only found in KREPB7 editosomes, and KREN1 is only found in KREPB8 editosomes. These are the same associations previously found in editosomes isolated via the TAP-tagged endonucleases KREN1, KREN2, or KREN3. Furthermore, TAP-tagged KREPB6, KREPB7, and KREPB8 complexes isolated from cells in which expression of their respective endonuclease were knocked down were disrupted and lacked the heterotrimeric insertion subcomplex (KRET2, KREPA1, and KREL2). These results and published data suggest that KREPB6, KREPB7, and KREPB8 associate with the deletion subcomplex, whereas the KREN1, KREN2, and KREN3 endonucleases associate with the insertion subcomplex."

We investigated the role of liganded and unliganded glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in IL-6 and IL-8 gene regulation in response to TNFα in the End1/E6E7 immortalized human endocervical epithelial cell line. In the absence of glucocorticoids, both decreasing GR protein levels by an siRNA strategy and results with the GR antagonist RU486 suggest a role for the unliganded GR in reduction of TNFα-induced IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels in End1/E6E7 cells. Moreover, GR-dependent repression of endogenous IL-6 mRNA as well as a minimal IL-6 promoter-reporter gene is also demonstrated in COS-1 cells in the absence of GR ligand, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism that is not cell-specific. TNFα induced recruitment of both the unliganded GR and GR-interacting protein type 1 (GRIP-1) to the IL-6 promoter. This, together with GRIP-1 overexpression studies, suggests a function for GRIP-1 as a GR co-repressor in this context. TNFα was shown to induce phosphorylation of the unliganded human GR at Ser-226 but not Ser-211, unlike dexamethasone, which induced hyperphosphorylation at both serine residues. Ser-226 is shown to be required for the ligand-independent GR-mediated repression of IL-6 in response to TNFα. Taken together, these results support a model whereby the unliganded GR attenuates TNFα-stimulated IL-6 transcription by a mechanism involving selective phosphorylation and recruitment of the unliganded GR and GRIP-1 to the IL-6 promoter. These findings suggest the presence of a novel autoregulatory mechanism that may prevent overproduction of IL-6 in the endocervix, possibly protecting against negative effects of excessive inflammation.

Immunology. 1992; 77: 330-337PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine with potent pro-inflammatory properties. It is responsible for T-cell and lymphocyte activation, B-cell differentiation, leukocytosis, and acute phase protein synthesis (3Kishimoto T. Blood. 1989; 74: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 plays an important role in the host defense against pathogen infections, as well as in cell proliferation and cell differentiation (4Iglesias M. Plowman G.D. Woodworth C.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 944-952PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 has also been associated with various autoimmune diseases and the progression of cervical cancer in the cervix in response to pathogen infections (5Rasmussen S.J. Eckmann L. Quayle A.J. Shen L.

Epithelial cells lining the female reproductive tract serve as a physical barrier against microbial infection (6Wira C.R. Fahey J.V. Sentman C.L. Pioli P.A. Shen L. Immunol.

In the cervix, IL-6 gene expression can be induced by pathogen infection (14Malejczyk J. Malejczyk M. Urbanski A. Köck A. Jablonska S. Orth G. Luger T.A.

Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 3818-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). IL-6 activates T-cells, causing them to differentiate, and also plays a role in cervical dilation and tumor angiogenesis (18Hirano T. Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Immunol.

Reprod. 2005; 20: 2724-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the cervix, TNFα signaling and IL-6 and IL-8 levels are relevant to viral infections such as HIV, where pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines play bidirectional roles in HIV-1 pathogenesis, transmission, susceptibility, and resistance (20Fichorova R.N. Bajpai M. Chandra N. Hsiu J.G. Spangler M. Ratnam V. Doncel G.F. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, HIV infection has been proposed to be a TNFα-driven disease (21Herbein G. Khan K.A. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 61-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). HIV-1 decreases cervical epithelial cell barrier function, most likely because of the increased production of inflammatory cytokines produced directly by the epithelial cells, including TNFα and IL-6 (8Nazli A.

The IL-6 promoter contains numerous regulatory elements within the region 300 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. These include a NFκB-binding element between positions −73 and −63, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ)-binding sites at positions −173 and −145, and an AP-1-binding site located between −283 and −277 relative to the transcriptional start site (1Vanden Berghe W.

Like TNFα, glucocorticoid levels are increased by inflammatory stress through the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (28Newton R. Thorax. 2000; 55: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Lipophilic glucocorticoids elicit a biological response via binding to their cognate receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The GR belongs to the steroid hormone receptor subfamily, part of the broader nuclear receptor superfamily. As an inducible transcription factor, it is found predominately in its inactive state in the cytoplasm of target cells (29Picard D. Kumar V. Chambon P. Yamamoto K.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, the GR is bound to a protein complex, which consists of heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70, immunophilins, and other factors (30Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). The classical mechanism of glucocorticoid action entails binding of the ligand to the ligand-binding domain of the GR, resulting in a conformational change of the receptor followed by the dissociation of the GR from the chaperone protein complex (31Griekspoor A. Zwart W. Neefjes J. Michalides R. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2007; 5: e003Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The ligand-bound GR translocates rapidly to the nucleus, where it recognizes specific palindromic DNA sequences known as glucocorticoid response elements in the promoters of target genes to positively regulate transcription (32Zhou J. Cidlowski J.A. Steroids. 2005; 70: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids can also negatively regulate gene expression via direct binding of the liganded GR to so-called negative glucocorticoid response element sequences or regulate transcription positively or negatively by interacting with other transcription factors (33Scheinman R.I.

Ligand-activated GR has been shown to interact with NFκB, AP-1, and C/EBP transcription factors, thereby repressing a variety of immune function genes (33Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M.

Rev. 2009; 30: 830-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition to activation by steroidal ligands, the GR has also been reported to be activated by various stimuli in the absence of glucocorticoid ligands (43Tanaka H. Makino Y. Miura T. Hirano F. Okamoto K. Komura K. Sato Y. Makino I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1601-1608PubMed Google Scholar, 44Eickelberg O. Roth M. Lörx R. Bruce V. Rüdiger J. Johnson M. Block L.H. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1726-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Ursodeoxycholic acid and the β-adrenergic receptor agonists salmeterol and salbutamol were shown to induce GR-dependent transcriptional activity (43Tanaka H. Makino Y. Miura T. Hirano F. Okamoto K. Komura K. Sato Y. Makino I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1601-1608PubMed Google Scholar, 44Eickelberg O. Roth M. Lörx R. Bruce V. Rüdiger J. Johnson M. Block L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1005-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) results in a selective glucocorticoid-independent increase of mGR phosphorylation and transcriptional activity on an endogenous promoter (45Kotitschke A. Sadie-Van Gijsen H. Avenant C. Fernandes S. Hapgood J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1726-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that GnRH-induced activation of the GR is dependent on the presence of the GnRH receptor and involves MAPKs (45Kotitschke A. Sadie-Van Gijsen H. Avenant C. Fernandes S. Hapgood J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1726-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). From the above-mentioned studies, it is clear that the unliganded GR can be activated by the GnRH receptor and possibly by other plasma membrane receptors. Whether the unliganded GR can be activated by TNFα has not been previously investigated. The present study explores the roles of liganded and unliganded GR in the response to TNFα on the IL-6 promoter in the human End1/E6E7 cell line, a model for the endocervix. End1/E6E7 cells (human endocervical cells immortalized with the human papillomavirus 16/E6E7) (46Fichorova R.N. Rheinwald J.G. Anderson D.J. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and COS-1 cells (monkey kidney cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The End1/E6E7 cells have been validated as a model for vaginal epithelial immune function by comparisons with primary cell cultures, tissues, animal models, and clinical findings and show similar toll-like receptor and cytokine profiles to primary cells (11Fichorova R.N. Anderson D.J. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 47Fichorova R.N. Desai P.J. Gibson 3rd, F.C. Genco C.A. Infect.

Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 1490-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). End1/E6E7 cells were grown in 175-cm2 culture flasks (Greiner Bio-One International) in keratinocyte serum-free medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with CaCl2 (final concentration, 0.4 mm), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, the provided bovine pituitary extract, and 0.1 ng/ml recombinant EGF. End1/E6E7 cells were subcultured at 60% confluency. The cells were passaged with prewarmed 0.25% trypsin, 0.1% EDTA in calcium- and magnesium-free PBS (Highveld Biologicals). For End1/E6E7 only, trypsinization was terminated by adding 10 ml of neutralization medium (DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Delta Bioproducts)). COS-1 cells were cultured in 175-cm2 culture flasks (Greiner Bio-One International) in DMEM from Sigma-Aldrich, supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS from Delta Bioproducts and a penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 μl/ml) mixture (penicillin-streptomycin) from Invitrogen. All of the cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. The cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma infection by means of Hoechst staining, and only mycoplasma-negative cell lines were used in experiments. 11β,16α-9-Fluoro-11,17,21-trihydroxy-16-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione (dexamethasone; DEX), 11β-(4-dimethylamino)phenyl-17β-hydroxy-17-(1-propynyl)estra-4,9-dien-3-one (mifepristone; RU486), and recombinant mouse TNFα (T7539) (at least 95% pure) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The anti-GR (H-300, sc-8992) and anti-GR-interacting protein 1 (GRIP-1) (M-343, sc-8996) antibodies, used in ChIP assays, were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-GRIP-1 antibody (G8970-10) used in Western blotting was from Abcam (US Biological). Anti-GAPDH (14C10) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling. The anti-histone H3 antibody (ab1791) and anti-rabbit HRP conjugate (NA934VS) were purchased from Abcam and AEC Amersham Biosciences, respectively. The wild type HA-tagged human GR (pCMV-HA-human GR) as well as the Ser-226 (pCMV-HA-S226A) phosphorylation-deficient hGR mutant were a kind gift from M. J. Garabedian ((New York University School of Medicine). The synthetic reporter promoter construct (IL-6NFκB)3-luc has been described elsewhere (49Plaisance S. Vanden Berghe W. Boone E. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 3733-3743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, it contains the proximal 50-bp minimal IL-6 promoter with a concatenated trimer of the wild type NFκB sequence and was kindly provided by G. Haegeman (University of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium). The pGL2-basic empty vector was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). HA-GRIP was a gift from M. R. Stallcup (University of Southern California). RNA was isolated from End1/E6E7 cells using TRI® reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) as per the manufacture's protocol. Briefly, End1/E6E7 cells were plated in 12-well culture plates (Nunc) at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. At 70–80% confluency, the cells were treated with test compounds and incubated as described in the figure legends. Induction medium was removed, and 400 μl of TRI® reagent was added to cells and incubated for 5 min at room temperature to allow lysis. RNA (0.5 μg) was reverse transcribed using the Transcriptor first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science), primed with anchored 2.5 μm oligo(dT)18 as per the manufacturer's instructions in a total reaction volume of 10 μl. Equal volumes of synthesized cDNA were used for semi-quantitative real time PCR using the SensiMix dT kit (Quantace Ltd.) and the Corbett real time PCR machine. IL-6 mRNA levels were measured using the following primer set: IL-6 forward, 5′-TCTCCACAAGCGCCTTCG-3′ and IL-6 reverse, 5′-CTCAGGGCTGAGATGCCG-3′. IL-8 mRNA levels were measured using the following primer set: IL-8 forward, 5′-TGCCAAGGAGTGCTAAAG-3′ and IL-8 reverse, 5′-CTCCACAACCCTCTGCAC-3′. GAPDH served as an internal control using the following primer set: GAPDH forward, 5′-TGAACGGGAAGCTCACTGG-3′ and GAPDH reverse, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. PCR conditions for all of the primer sets were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. Melting curve analysis was performed to confirm amplification of a single product in each sample. Relative transcript levels were calculated using the method described by Pfaffl (50Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (25424) Google Scholar) and were normalized to the relative GAPDH transcript levels. End1/E6E7 cells plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well culture plate were transfected with 10 nm validated GR HS_NR3C1_5 (catalog number SI02654757) siRNA directed against the human GR or validated scrambled nonsilencing sequence control (NSC) siRNA (catalog number 1027310) (Qiagen) using HiPerfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, specific or NSC siRNA was diluted in prewarmed Optimem medium with GlutaMAXTM (Invitrogen), to which 3.5 μl of transfection reagent was added. The transfection mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then added dropwise to the cells to a final concentration of 10 nm. The cells were incubated for 24 h before being treated for 24 h with compounds. RNA was then harvested, and IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels were analyzed by quantitative real time PCR, as described above. The cells that were transfected in parallel were analyzed by Western blotting as described below to verify the protein knockdown. For GRIP-1 co-factor overexpression studies, 12-well plates were used. End1/E6E7 cell were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well, and 24 h after seeding, the cells were transfected with 500 ng of pHA-GRIP-1 or pGL2-basic empty vector. Transfected cells were incubated overnight in culture medium at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. The cells were treated 24 h after transfection and incubated for 24 h with various compounds, as described in the figure legends. RNA was isolated as described elsewhere. For investigation of endogenous IL-6 mRNA expression in the absence and presence of overexpressed GR, COS-1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. Twenty-four hours after seeding, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pCMV-HA-human wild type GR. The cells were treated with compounds 24 h after transfection as described in the figure legends. RNA was isolated as described elsewhere. For investigation of IL-6 promoter-reporter activity in the absence and presence of overexpressed GR, COS-1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. The following day cells were transfected with 125 ng of pCMV-HA-hGR or pGL2-basic and 250 ng of (IL-6NFκB)3-luc plasmids. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated as described in the figure legends. To investigate the involvement of phosphorylation at Ser-226 of the unliganded GR in regulating endogenous IL-6 mRNA levels in response to TNFα, the following protocol was followed. COS-1 cells in 12-well plates were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. Twenty-four hours after seeding, COS-1 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pCMV-HA-S226A mutant GR, pCMV-HA-hGR, or pGL2-basic (empty vector). Transfected cells were treated 24 h after transfection as described in the figure legends. RNA was isolated as described elsewhere. Luciferase assay reagent (Promega Corp.) was used to quantify luciferase activity in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 μl of cell lysate was allowed to react with 50 μl of luciferase assay reagent. The relative light units were measured using the Veritas luminometer (Turner Biosystems). A further 5 μl of cell lysate for each sample was used to measure protein concentration in each well using the Bradford protein determination method. Luciferase relative light units were normalized to protein concentration, and the results were expressed as fold induction compared with vehicle EtOH control (0.1% EtOH) set as 1. End1/E6E7 cells, plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well culture dish (Nunc, Denmark), were grown to 80% confluency, after which culture medium was aspirated and replaced with keratinocyte serum-free medium not supplemented with bovine pituitary extract, EGF, and CaCl2, followed by incubation for 24 h. The cells were pretreated with steroid or vehicle (EtOH) for 1 h before TNFα stimulation (20 ng/ml) and further incubated for 2 h, after which they were washed with ice-cold PBS. Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 proteinase minitablet (Roche Applied Science)) was added to cells (100 μl/well), and cell lysates were harvested by scraping. Lysates were placed in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and tubes were placed on ice for 10 min. The lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C (Eppendorf 5417R). The nuclear pellet was washed with 1 ml of PBS and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 80 μl of DNase I buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 10 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2), and 5 μl of DNase I enzyme was added, followed by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C. To 80-μl nuclear fractions, 20 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue) (51Sambrook J. Maniatus T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was added. For SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, samples were incubated at 100 °C for 10 min followed by SDS-PAGE as described below. For Western blotting, hybridization was performed with antibodies raised against GR and H3. H3 served as a control for nuclear fractions, as well as loading control. For Western blot analysis, protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE at 200 V in running buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 250 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS) (51Sambrook J. Maniatus T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Mini Protean® II electrophoresis cell. The proteins were electroblotted onto HybondTM ECLTM nitrocellulose membrane (AEC Amersham Biosciences) for 90 min at 180 mA with Bio-Rad Mini Trans-blot® cell in ice-cold transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, 10% (v/v) methanol). The membranes were blocked in 10% (w/v) fat-free milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween (TBS-T), unless otherwise stated, for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with primary antibody, the membranes were washed for 15 min and twice for 5 min in TBS-T at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were subsequently washed as before. To evaluate the association of the GR and the co-factor, GRIP-1, with the IL-6 promoter, the protocol described by Ma et al. (52Ma H. Shang Y. Lee D.Y. Stallcup M.R. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 364: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was followed with a few modifications. Briefly, End1/E6E7 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 106 cells/15-cm2 culture dish and allowed to reach 80% confluency, after which culture medium was replaced with keratinocyte serum-free medium not supplemented with bovine pituitary extract, EGF, CaCl2, and PenStrep, followed by incubation for 24 h. The cells were treated with steroid for 1 h prior to the addition of 20 ng/ml TNFα and then incubated at 37 °C for a further 2 h. The proteins were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 0.125 m glycine, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature, while shaking. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Thereafter, the cells were scaped and harvested in PBS containing protease inhibitors tablet (Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 1200 × g. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 500 μl of nuclear lysis buffer (1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA plus 1 tablet 1× Complete"

https://openalex.org/W1979233014,"The low success rate of somatic nuclear transfer (NT) is hypothesized to be mainly due to functional defects in the trophoblast cell lineage rather than the inner cell mass (ICM); this hypothesis, however, remains to be tested directly. Here we separated the ICMs from cloned blastocysts and aggregated the cloned ICM with two fertilization-derived (FD) tetraploid (4N) embryos. We found that the full-term development of cloned ICMs was dramatically improved after the trophoblast cells in the cloned blastocysts were replaced by cells from tetraploid embryos, thus providing direct evidence that defects in trophoblast cell lineage underlie the low success rate of somatic NT."
https://openalex.org/W2070533388,"Emerging evidence suggests that the tumor suppressor p53 is also a crucial regulator for many physiological processes. Previous observations indicate that p53 suppresses inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory antigen-presenting cells. To investigate the potential role of p53 in autoimmune effector T cells, we generated p53null CD45.1 mice by crossing p53null CD45.2 and CD45.1 mice. We demonstrate that p53null CD45.1 mice spontaneously developed autoimmunity, with a significant increase in IL-17-producing Th17 effectors in their lymph nodes (4.7±1.0%) compared to the age-matched counterparts (1.9±0.8% for p53null CD45.2, 1.1 ±0.2% for CD45.1, and 0.5±0.1% for CD45.2mice). Likewise, p53null CD45.1 mice possess highly elevated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines IL17 and IL6. This enhanced Th17 response results largely from an increased sensitivity of p53null CD45.1 T cells to IL6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Administration of STAT3 inhibitor S31-201 (IC50 of 38.0±7.2 μM for IL6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation), but not PBS control, to p53null CD45.1 mice suppressed Th17 effectors and alleviated autoimmune pathology. This is the first report revealing that p53 activity in T cells suppresses autoimmunity by controlling Th17 effectors. This study suggests that p53 serves as a guardian of immunological functions and that the p53-STAT3-Th17 axis might be a therapeutic target for autoimmunity.—Zhang, S., Zheng, M., Kibe, R., Huang, Y., Marrero, L., Warren, S., Zieske, A.

https://openalex.org/W2038811633,"Fungi that can reduce elemental sulfur to sulfide are widely distributed, but the mechanism and physiological significance of the reaction have been poorly characterized. Here, we purified elemental sulfur-reductase (SR) and cloned its gene from the elemental sulfur-reducing fungus Fusarium oxysporum. We found that NADPH-glutathione reductase (GR) reduces elemental sulfur via glutathione as an intermediate. A loss-of-function mutant of the SR/GR gene generated less sulfide from elemental sulfur than the wild-type strain. Its growth was hypersensitive to elemental sulfur, and it accumulated higher levels of oxidized glutathione, indicating that the GR/glutathione system confers tolerance to cytotoxic elemental sulfur by reducing it to less harmful sulfide. The SR/GR reduced polysulfide as efficiently as elemental sulfur, which implies that soluble polysulfide shuttles reducing equivalents to exocellular insoluble elemental sulfur and generates sulfide. The ubiquitous distribution of the GR/glutathione system together with our findings that GR-deficient mutants derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus nidulans reduced less sulfur and that their growth was hypersensitive to elemental sulfur indicated a wide distribution of the system among fungi. These results indicate a novel biological function of the GR/glutathione system in elemental sulfur reduction, which is distinguishable from bacterial and archaeal mechanisms of glutathione- independent sulfur reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1988109049,"Crosstalk between transcription factors and cytokines precisely regulates tissue homeostasis. Transcriptional intermediary factor 1γ (TIF1γ) regulates vertebrate hematopoietic development, can control transcription elongation, and is a component of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Here we show that deletion of TIF1γ in adult hematopoiesis is compatible with life and long-term maintenance of essential blood cell lineages. However, loss of TIF1γ results in deficient long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) transplantation activity, deficient short-term HSC (ST-HSC) bone marrow retention, and priming ST-HSCs to myelomonocytic lineage. These defects are hematopoietic cell-autonomous, and priming of TIF1γ-deficient ST-HSCs can be partially rescued by wild-type hematopoietic cells. TIF1γ can form complexes with TAL1 or PU.1—two essential DNA-binding proteins in hematopoiesis—occupy specific subsets of their DNA binding sites in vivo, and repress their transcriptional activity. These results suggest a regulation of adult hematopoiesis through TIF1γ-mediated transcriptional repression of TAL1 and PU.1 target genes."

https://openalex.org/W2049345468,"Excitotoxicity mediated by overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) has been implicated in a variety of neuropathological conditions in the central nervous system (CNS). It has been suggested that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) neurotoxicity is developmentally regulated, but the definite pattern of the regulation has been controversial, and the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we show that NMDA treatment leads to significant cell death in mature (9 and 12 days in vitro) hippocampal neurons or hippocampi of young postnatal day 12 and adult rats but not in immature (3 and 6 days in vitro) neurons or embryonic day 18 and neonatal rat hippocampi. In contrast, NMDA promotes survival of immature neurons against tropic deprivation. Interestingly, it is found that NMDA preferentially activates p38 MAPK in mature neuron and adult rat hippocampus, but it favors ERK1/2 activation in immature neuron and postnatal day 0 rat hippocampus. Moreover, it is shown that NMDA neurotoxicity in mature neuron is mediated via p38 MAPK activation, and neuroprotection in immature neuron is mediated via ERK1/2 activation, whereas all these effects are NR2B-containing NMDAR-dependent, as well as Ca(2+)-dependent. We also revealed that mature and immature neurons showed no difference in the amplitude of NMDA-induced intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) increase. However, the basal level of [Ca(2+)](i) is shown to elevate with the maturation of neuron, and this elevation is attributable to the changes in NMDA neurotoxicity but not to the switch of the NMDAR signaling pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that a switch of NMDA receptor-favorite intracellular signal pathways from ERK1/2 to p38 MAPK and the elevated basal level of [Ca(2+)](i) with age might be critical for the developmental changes in NMDA neurotoxicity in the hippocampal neuron."

PC2 has been found to form oligomers in native tissues, suggesting that similar to other TRP channels, it may form functional homo- or heterotetramers with other TRP subunits. We have recently demonstrated that the homodimerization of PC2 is mediated by both N-terminal and C-terminal domains, and it is known that PC2 can heterodimerize with PC1, TRPC1, and TRPV4.

It is the most common inherited human renal disease and results from germ line mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2 (1Calvet J.P. Grantham J.J. Semin. Nephrol. 2001; 21: 107-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The cardinal feature of the ADPKD kidney is the presence of multiple fluid-filled cysts. However, cysts can arise in other epithelial structures such as the liver and pancreas. Variable expression of noncystic manifestations such as cardiac valve abnormalities, diverticular disease, and intracranial aneurysms have been described in this condition (2Wilson P.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar).Mutations in PKD2 account for 15% of all patients with ADPKD. The PKD2 protein, polycystin-2 (PC2), is a type II membrane protein with the properties of a high conductance nonselective Ca2+-permeable cation channel (3Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T.

The physiological significance of these ciliary and/or plasma membrane complexes in kidney function is not yet clear. Mice deficient in TRPC1 and TRPV4 do not develop kidney cysts.Functional interactions between PC2 and other major ER Ca2+ release channels such as the inositol trisphosphate receptor and the type II ryanodine receptor (in cardiac tissue) have also been reported (11Li Y.

PC2 binds via its C terminus to both receptors, although possibly to the ryanodine receptor in its open state (Fig. 4). An additional N-terminal binding site for PC2 to the ryanodine receptor has been described (12Anyatonwu G.I. Estrada M. Tian X. Somlo S. Ehrlich B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6454-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Again, the functional significance of these ER complexes is uncertain. In addition, the precise stoichiometry of the various PC2 complexes has not been resolved.In this paper, we report that PC2 homodimerization is regulated by a third dimerization domain. In recent studies, we reported the existence of a new N-terminal dimerization domain (18Feng S. Okenka G.M. Bai C.X. Streets A.J. Newby L.J. DeChant B.T. Tsiokas L. Obara T. Ong A.C. J. Biol.

Although there is disagreement as to whether the latter leads to dimerization or trimerization of the PC2 C terminus, oligomerization of PC2 appears to be an absolute requirement for PC1 binding (19Giamarchi A. Feng S. Rodat-Despoix L. Xu Y. Bubenshchikova E. Newby L.J. Hao J. Gaudioso C. Crest M. Lupas A.N. Honoré E. Williamson M.P. Obara T. Ong A.C. Delmas P.

The specificity of CC2 in mediating PC2 dimerization for PC1 recognition is confirmed by the lack of effect of the Cys632 mutants in this study.Previously, we showed that PC2 mutants unable to undergo C-terminal dimerization (PC2–4M) were still able to form ER-based Ca2+ release channels and could partially rescue the LR defect seen in zebrafish embryos though not the cystic pronephric kidney (19Giamarchi A. Feng S. Rodat-Despoix L. Xu Y. Bubenshchikova E. Newby L.J. Hao J. Gaudioso C. Crest M. Lupas A.N. Honoré E. Williamson M.P. Obara T. Ong A.C. Delmas P. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1176-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results indicated that although C-terminal dimerization is specific to the formation of PC1-PC2 heteromers, other upstream dimerization regions (including the N-terminal domain) are critical to the formation of homomeric PC2 complexes. Our results demonstrate that PC2-C632A mutants have reduced ER PC2-mediated Ca2+ release similar to the PC2–4M mutants and predict that they will be similarly functionally effective in rescuing the laterality defect.In conclusion, we demonstrate that PC2 homodimerization is regulated by three distinct domains and that these events regulate formation of the tetrameric PC2 channel (Fig. 5). Our results define a single cysteine residue, Cys632, known to be mutated in a PKD2 pedigree, as a key functional residue regulating PC2 channel activity (25Magistroni R. He N. Wang K. Andrew R. Johnson A. Gabow P. Dicks E. Parfrey P. Torra R. San-Millan J.L. Coto E. Van Dijk M. Breuning M. Peters D. Bogdanova N. Ligabue G. Albertazzi A. Hateboer N. Demetriou K. Pierides A. Deltas C. St. George-Hyslop P. Ravine D. Pei Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1164-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cys632 lies in a putative third extracellular loop (for plasma membrane channel) or third intraluminal loop (for the ER channel) which constitutes part of the predicted channel pore region for PC2. Our studies indicate that it mediates disulfide bonding between PC2 monomers to form homodimers critical for the formation of tetrameric channels (Fig. 5). Co-expression of a C632A mutant suppressed the effect of wild-type PC2 in ER Ca2+ release assays, proving the functional importance of this interaction. Of interest, a combined mutant (C632A+4M) retaining the N-terminal domain had almost absent ATP-sensitive PC2-dependent Ca2+ release. In a previous study, we found that expression of the N-terminal dimerization domain as a surface-anchored protein in mammalian cells could inhibit plasma membrane PC2 channel activity in mIMCD3 cells (18Feng S. Okenka G.M. Bai C.X. Streets A.J. Newby L.J. DeChant B.T. Tsiokas L. Obara T. Ong A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28471-28479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results imply that the N-terminal dimerization domain is not critical for the function of ER PC2 channels but is required for the function of surface PC2 channels. In LLCPK-1 cells, surface PC2 can be activated via membrane depolarization or EGF stimulation. This effect appears to be mediated by the unblocking of PC2 by mDia-1 through its activation by RhoA (32Bai C.X. Kim S. Li W.P. Streets A.J. Ong A.C. Tsiokas L. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It seems likely that distinct regulatory pathways, possibly through altering key protein-protein interactions, regulate the function of the ER and surface PC2 channels.FIGURE 5Model of PC2 in a lipid bilayer showing the three dimerization domains.

It is the most common inherited human renal disease and results from germ line mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2 (1Calvet J.P. Grantham J.J. Semin. Nephrol. 2001; 21: 107-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The cardinal feature of the ADPKD kidney is the presence of multiple fluid-filled cysts. However, cysts can arise in other epithelial structures such as the liver and pancreas. Variable expression of noncystic manifestations such as cardiac valve abnormalities, diverticular disease, and intracranial aneurysms have been described in this condition (2Wilson P.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar).Mutations in PKD2 account for 15% of all patients with ADPKD. The PKD2 protein, polycystin-2 (PC2), is a type II membrane protein with the properties of a high conductance nonselective Ca2+-permeable cation channel (3Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. Deltas C.C. Peters D.J. Somlo S. Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). PC2 (or TRPP2) has been included in the TRP (transient receptor potential) superfamily of channels due to its sequence homology to other TRP channels (4Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V.

In primary cilia, PC2 forms a flow-activated mechanosensitive channel complex in association with PC1 and/or TRPV4 (6Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E. Lu W.

At the basolateral membrane, PC2 (with PC1) could be implicated in cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion, including possibly in mechanotransduction (8Newby L.J. Streets A.J. Zhao Y. Harris P.C. Ward C.J.

PC2 has also been shown to function as an ER Ca2+ release channel, in association with inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors in different studies (10Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y.

Interactions between the two proteins may regulate their trafficking, and there is evidence for reciprocal activation or inhibition of activity in different experimental systems (13Hanaoka K. Qian F.

The physiological function of PC2-TRPC1 channels is unknown, although it has distinct properties from homomeric PC2 and TRPC1 channels (17Bai C.X. Giamarchi A. Rodat-Despoix L. Padilla F. Downs T.

https://openalex.org/W2081106008,"The evolutionary diversity of the HSP70 gene family at the genetic level has generated complex structural variations leading to altered functional specificity and mode of regulation in different cellular compartments. By utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system for better understanding the global functional cooperativity between Hsp70 paralogs, we have dissected the differences in functional properties at the biochemical level between mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mtHsp70) Ssc1 and an uncharacterized Ssc3 paralog. Based on the evolutionary origin of Ssc3 and a high degree of sequence homology with Ssc1, it has been proposed that both have a close functional overlap in the mitochondrial matrix. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that there is no functional cross-talk between Ssc1 and Ssc3 paralogs. The lack of in vivo functional overlap is due to altered conformation and significant lower stability associated with Ssc3. The substrate-binding domain of Ssc3 showed poor affinity toward mitochondrial client proteins and Tim44 due to the open conformation in ADP-bound state. In addition to that, the nucleotide-binding domain of Ssc3 showed an altered regulation by the Mge1 co-chaperone due to a high degree of conformational plasticity, which strongly promotes aggregation. Besides, Ssc3 possesses a dysfunctional inter-domain interface thus rendering it unable to perform functions similar to generic Hsp70s. Moreover, we have identified the critical amino acid sequence of Ssc1 and Ssc3 that can ""make or break"" mtHsp70 chaperone function. Together, our analysis provides the first evidence to show that the nucleotide-binding domain of mtHsp70s plays a critical role in determining the functional specificity among paralogs and orthologs across kingdoms."

NVL2UD contains three α helices with an organization resembling that of a winged helix motif, whereas a pair of β-strands is missing. The structure is unique and distinct from those of other known type II AAA-ATPases, such as VCP. Consequently, we identified nucleolin from a HeLa cell extract as a binding partner of this domain.

The AAA-ATPases are characterized by the presence of one (type I) or two (type II) copies of a well conserved catalytic ATPase domain comprising 220–250 amino acids. NVL is classified as a type II AAA-ATPase with two tandem AAA domains. In fact, NVL has two alternatively spliced isoforms, a short form, NVL1, and a long form, NVL2, which are produced from different methionines as the translation initiation sites (Fig. 1) (5Germain-Lee E.L.

Despite the sequence similarity between VCP/p97 and NVL in their AAA regions, the N-terminal regions of NVL2 (NVL2UD) and VCP/p97 are different. The two proteins reside in different subcellular locations; VCP/p97 is in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum membrane, whereas NVL is exclusively localized in the nucleolus (5Germain-Lee E.L.

The amino acid sequences of the N-terminal regions are variable, in contrast to the high sequence conservation of the AAA domains. The N-terminal regions of the AAA-ATPases are generally considered to contain a domain that is responsible for the specific role of the enzymes, such as adaptor binding, substrate specificity, or localization. The NVL2UD has a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) that is responsible for nucleolar targeting. Nagahama et al. (6Nagahama M. Hara Y. Seki A. Yamazoe T. Kawate Y. Shinohara T. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K.

Two of them exist in NVL2UD. A stretch of basic amino acids, such as arginine and lysine, reportedly contributes to the nucleolar accumulation of proteins (12Siomi H. Shida H. Nam S.H. Nosaka T.

The nucleolus comprises a high density complex of ribosomal DNA, ribosomal RNA, and its precursors, as well as many proteins. The primary physiological function of the nucleolus is ribosome biogenesis (14Cmarko D. Smigova J. Minichova L. Popov A. Histol. Histopathol. 2008; 23: 1291-1298PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies revealed that the nucleolus plays other important roles in maintaining cellular viability, including RNA processing, specific mRNA stabilization, cell cycle control, and assembly of RNA viruses; for these reasons, it is implicated in cancer and other diseases (15Montanaro L. Treré D. Derenzini M. Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 173: 301-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 16Greco A. Rev. Med.

The nucleolus is organized and/or maintained using a network of protein-protein and protein-RNA/DNA interactions (21Emmott E. Hiscox J.A. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Among the nucleolus interactome, two proteins, nucleolin and nucleophosmin, are considered as the key hub molecules. When each protein was knocked out or knocked down, the function as well as the structure of the nucleolus collapsed (22Ugrinova I. Monier K. Ivaldi C. Thiry M. Storck S. Mongelard F. Bouvet P. BMC Mol. Biol. 2007; 8: 66Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Ma N. Matsunaga S. Takata H. Ono-Maniwa R. Uchiyama S. Fukui K. J.

Interactions with these hub proteins through the NoLS might direct the proteins to the nucleolus. Nevertheless, recently, the definition of the NoLS has become more complex, because many sequences that do not match the classic NoLS motif have been reported (reviewed in Ref. 21Emmott E. Hiscox J.A. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The divergent NoLS sequences are considered to use a variety of pathways to target proteins to the nucleolus. It is proposed that the key action of the NoLS is to be recognized by one or more of the nucleolar resident proteins (21Emmott E. Hiscox J.A. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Consequently, the mechanism-based classification of the NoLS has become important in this field. The purpose of this study is to clarify the mechanism of the subcellular localization of NVL2 by a structural analysis of the N-terminal region of NVL2. Using a bioinformatics approach combined with a high throughput protein expression study, we isolated an “NMR-ready” domain (NVL2UD, residues 1–74) from the N-terminal unique region of NVL2 (Fig. 1A) (25Iwaya N. Goda N. Unzai S. Fujiwara K. Tanaka T. Tomii K. Tochio H. Shirakawa M. Hiroaki H. J. Biomol. NMR. 2007; 37: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and determined its three-dimensional structure using NMR. The solution NMR study revealed that the structure of NVL2UD adopted part of the winged helix motif. The nucleolar localization signal is exposed on the molecular surface. We also confirmed that the domain solely exhibits the nucleolar localizing activity. Additionally, we identified the nucleolin C-terminal fragment as a binding target of NVL2UD from HeLa cell extracts. The key residues responsible for nucleolar localization were identical to those for nucleolin binding. Finally, based on the “reversed” structural proteomics approach, we propose a physiological function for NVL2 in the nucleolus. DNA oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Hokkaido System Science Co. Ltd. (Sapporo, Japan). The anti-nucleolin antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Other chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). The expression and purification of the N-terminal unique domains from mice were described previously (25Iwaya N. Goda N. Unzai S. Fujiwara K. Tanaka T. Tomii K. Tochio H. Shirakawa M. Hiroaki H. J. Biomol. NMR. 2007; 37: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We used the GST fusion forms of NVL2UD for biochemical assays. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose followed by glutathione-Sepharose affinity resin (GE Healthcare), and then dialyzed. We constructed plasmids for expressing GFP-tagged NVL2UD(1–74) and NVL2UD(1–74)AA in mammalian cells using the pcDNA-GFP-PRESAT vector, a pcDNA3.1-based vector containing the enhanced GFP gene with the PRESAT vector cloning site, 3N. Goda, T. Tenno, and H. Hiroaki, manuscript in preparation. according to the modified protocol (26Goda N. Tenno T. Takasu H. Hiroaki H. Shirakawa M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We also constructed plasmids for expressing His6-tagged human nucleolin fragments, R1234G (containing RRM domains 1–4 and the GAR domain (residues 286–710)), R123 (residues 286–560), R12 (residues 286–468), R23 (residues 391–560), R34 (residues 478–652), R34G (residues 478–710), R4G (residues 565–710), and R1 (residues 286–390), using the pET-His6-PRESAT vector according to the reported method (27Tenno T. Goda N. Tateishi Y. Tochio H. Mishima M. Hayashi H. Shirakawa M. Hiroaki H. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The preparation of isotopically labeled NMR samples of NVL2UD was described previously (25Iwaya N. Goda N. Unzai S. Fujiwara K. Tanaka T. Tomii K. Tochio H. Shirakawa M. Hiroaki H. J. Biomol. NMR. 2007; 37: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The NMR experiments and following structural determination are described in the supplemental material. We used HeLa and HEK293 cells in all experiments. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin, and were incubated in humidified CO2 containing (5%) air at 37 °C. Roughly 107 cells were collected, washed with PBS, and suspended in 200 μl of buffer containing 17.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 55 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.25 mm PMSF, 0.05% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (0.2 μg/ml antipain, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.08 μg/ml pepstatin). After incubation on ice, the cells were disrupted by sonication. The whole cell extract was incubated with 180 pmol of either GST-NVL2UD(1–93) or GST alone. Protein complexes were captured by glutathione-Sepharose. After washing three times, the resin was mixed with an equal volume of SDS loading dye. Protein complexes were resolved using SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In-gel proteolytic digestion followed by electrospray ionization tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) analysis was done at the Integrated Center for Mass Spectrometry (Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe University) using a mass spectrometer (Q-TOF 2; Micromass, Manchester, UK). Protein identification was performed using Mascot (Matrix Science). The HeLa cells were collected, washed with PBS, and suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors. The cell extract was incubated with GST-NVL2UD(1–74) or GST alone. Protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. We detected the nucleolin fragments using the anti-nucleolin antibody (catalog no. sc-17826, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) followed by an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. The bands were visualized using a kit (ECL-Plus, GE Healthcare). An LAS-1000 detector (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) was used for detection. To assess the protein-protein interaction properties of NVL2UD and nucleolin C-terminal fragments, a GST pull-down assay was conducted. GST or GST-NVL2UD (140 pmol) was incubated with the E. coli cell lysate-expressed His6-tagged nucleolin fragments in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors for 2 h at 4 °C and then immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h. After three washes, an equal volume of SDS loading dye was added, and the proteins were fractionated by 12 or 15% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The signal intensities were quantified by the ImageJ 1.40g program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cells were grown either on chamber slides (Matsunami Glass Ind. Ltd., Osaka, Japan), in normal 35-mm dishes, or on glass bottom 35-mm dishes (MatTek Corp.) to about 30% confluence. GFP-tagged-NVL2UD or enhanced GFP alone was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h of incubation, living cells were observed. For immunological staining, we washed the cells twice with PBS and fixed them with methanol for 20 min at −20 °C, washed them twice with PBS for 5 min, and then incubated them with the anti-nucleolin antibody in PBS supplemented with 5% skim milk overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then washed and incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody (Cy3TM-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, C2181 (Sigma)) in PBS supplemented with 5% skim milk for 60 min. The cells were washed and then incubated with DAPI (final concentration, 100 ng/ml) in PBS at 5 min. The cells were then mounted in Prolong Antifade mounting medium (Invitrogen). All images were obtained using fluorescence microscopy with a microscope equipped with a color CCD camera system (IX71 and DP-70, respectively; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The final ensemble of the 20 lowest energy structures of NVL2UD(1–74) was generated from a total of 994 experimental constraints derived by NMR. A representative image is presented in Fig. 2B. Supplemental Table S1 and supplemental Fig. S1 show that the resulting structures satisfy the experimental constraints well. The stereochemical quality of the ensemble is good, with >91% of the backbone ϕ-ψ angles occupying the most favored or allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot (supplemental Table S1 and supplemental Fig. S1). Excluding the disordered regions that are the N- and C-terminal residues and parts of internal loops (residues 1–10 plus the extra four residues from the vector, residues 28, 49–51, and 71–74), the root mean square deviation values are 0.418 Å for the backbone heavy atoms and 1.035 Å for all heavy atoms. Based on the refined structure of NVL2UD, we conducted a multiple sequence alignment of the domains among the NVL orthologs, using a secondary structure-based penalty (Fig. 1B). Although the amino acid identities among these NVL homologs are not high (19–86%), the residues forming the hydrophobic core as well as the second loop connecting helices 2 and 3 are well conserved. Consequently, the N-terminal regions of the NVL2 homologs are novel structural domains with similar folds. NVL2UD(1–74) adopts an orthogonal three-helix fold, which consists of helix 1 (residues 11–23), helix 2 (residues 32–42), and helix 3 (residues 52–70) (Fig. 2A). A structural comparison of NVL2UD, using the DaliLite server (28Holm L. Rosenström P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (2997) Google Scholar), identified many proteins containing a winged helix domain with Z-scores higher than 4.5. For example, the structures of the DNA binding domain of a transcription factor, DP2 (PDB code 1cf7, Z-score 5.2), and the Zα domain of a double-stranded RNA deaminase I, ADAR1 (PDB code 1qgp, Z-score 4.5) and that of the 34L protein (PDB code 1sfu, Z-score 4.5) resembled the NVL2UD structure. In addition, the partial structures of cullin-1 (PDB code 1ldj, Z-score 4.8), FurB (PDB code 2o03, Z-score 4.7), replication terminator protein (PDB code 1f4k, Z-score 4.7), and NEDD8 (PDB code 3dqv, Z-score 4.6) were retrieved. The presence of this fold was not predicted by several structure prediction methods, including FUGUE (29Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) and FORTE (30Tomii K. Akiyama Y. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 594-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As described below, NVL2UD contains the NoLS. This motif resides in the second loop region, which is exposed to the solvent. To identify new NVL2UD-associated proteins, we performed an in vitro protein-binding experiment followed by an electrospray ionization-MS/MS analysis. We used HeLa whole cell extracts to identify the partner proteins associated with NVL2UD(1–93). The Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the affinity-captured proteins revealed several polypeptides that specifically co-purified with GST-NVL2UD (Fig. 3A). In comparison with the proteins associated with GST alone, we carefully examined a specifically enriched protein band at 30 kDa. The MS analysis revealed that most NVL2UD-binding proteins were related to RNA processing or the nucleolus (Table 1 and supplemental Table S2). It is particularly interesting that some potential NVL2UD-binding proteins harbor RRM domains, although none of these binding proteins has previously been reported to interact with NVL2. As shown in Table 1, nucleolin is the second candidate of the NVL2UD-binding partners. Nucleolin is an abundant protein in the nucleolus and is the putative NoLS receptor. Therefore, we further addressed this link between nucleolin and NVL2. A question remained as to the difference between the theoretical molecular mass of full-length nucleolin (Mr76,614) and that of the analyzed band (30 kDa). We confirmed the existence of full-length nucleolin in both the NVL2UD(1–74) and NVL2UD(1–93)-associated proteins, using a Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S2). We detected full-length nucleolin by two distinct antibodies, sc-17826 (epitope: 271–520) and ab22758 (epitope: 1–100). The full-length nucleolin showed a band at 95 kDa, probably because of phosphorylation. We detected several shorter nucleolin fragments with the sc-17826 antibody. The shorter fragments are attributed to the degradation of its unstructured N-terminal region during sample preparation. The N-terminal region contains proteolytic sites (31Pasternack M.S. Bleier K.J. McInerney T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14703-14708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The association of nucleolin with NVL2UD(1–74) and NVL2UD(1–93) was also detected using HEK293 cells, although the full-length nucleolin in the cell extract was more rapidly degraded than that in the HeLa cell extract, despite the use of increased amounts of the protease inhibitors (supplemental Fig. S2).TABLE 1List of protein candidates identified from mass spectrometric analysisProteinMolecular massScoreaScore determined as −10 Log (P), where P is the probability that the observed match is a random event, calculated by the program MASCOT.

A score >54 indicates extensive homology, p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Human nucleolin contains 710 amino acids. It is divided roughly into three regions: N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain is rich in acidic residues and is predicted as natively disordered. The central domain contains four repeats of RRM domains. The C-terminal GAR domain is rich in glycine and arginine. Both the RRM and GAR domains are RNA binding domains (32Ghisolfi L. Kharrat A. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because the peptide sequence detected by the MS/MS analysis corresponded to the C terminus of the fourth RRM domain (Fig. 3C), we prepared the recombinant nucleolin, R1234G (residues 286–710, containing the four RRM and the C-terminal GAR domains), and examined its interaction with NVL2UD. The R1234G interacted with NVL2UD specifically, thus suggesting that this region of nucleolin was sufficient for NVL2UD binding (Fig. 4, A and B). To define the minimum region responsible for NVL2UD binding by nucleolin, we expressed several fragments of nucleolin in E. coli and examined their NVL2UD binding ability. Almost all of the fragments (R123, R34G, R12, R23, R34, and R4G) except for R1 retained affinity for NVL2UD (Fig. 4, B and C). In detail, R123 and R34G showed higher affinity than the others, and R34 showed the lowest affinity. Because the sequence identity among the four RRMs is not high (20–38%), it is unlikely that NVL2UD recognizes a certain common motif or surface among the four RRM domains (supplemental Fig. S3). We propose another mechanism, in which two or more successive RNA binding domains (RRM and GAR) are responsible for NVL2UD binding with promiscuous recognition. Additionally, we expected that the interaction between NVL2UD and nucleolin is not accomplished by simple protein-protein binding. We examined whether the purified R12 interacted with NVL2UD, using NMR titration experiments with R12 and 15N-labeled NVL2UD (supplemental Fig. S4). No significant chemical shift perturbations were observed, suggesting the involvement of additional factors for their interaction. According to the unusual observation described above, we examined the effect of RNA on the nucleolin-NVL interaction. The nucleolus contains highly condensed RNAs, especially preribosomal RNA, and thus RNA could affect the interaction between NVL2UD and nucleolin. To test this possibility, we added RNase A to the pull-down assay, and the specific interaction disappeared (Fig. 4D). This result revealed that RNA is necessary for the NVL2-nucleolin interaction. Therefore, NVL2UD might bind to the nucleolin-RNA complex in which more than two successive RNA binding domains hold the RNA. In fact, NVL2UD contains the classic NoLS consensus, (R/K)(R/K)X(R/K), at residues 49–52. When the RRKR motif was substituted to RRAA, the nucleolar accumulation of NVL2 was lost (6Nagahama M. Hara Y. Seki A. Yamazoe T. Kawate Y. Shinohara T. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5712-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To examine whether these residues contribute to the RNA-mediated NVL2-nucleolin interaction, we used the NVL2UD RRAA mutant (NVL2UDAA) (Fig. 4D). The NVL2UDAA could not interact with nucleolin, irrespective of the presence of RNA. Next, to examine the relationship between the nucleolin-NVL2UD interaction and the nucleolar localization of NVL2UD, we compared the cellular localizations of NVL2UD and NVL2UDAA. Whereas NVL2UD accumulated in the nucleus and mainly in nucleoli, almost all of the NVL2UDAA remained in the cytoplasm and did not localize to the nucleolus (Fig. 5). These results demonstrated that NVL2UD is an isolated domain sufficient for the nucleolar localization of NVL2 and that the nucleolar localization of NVL2UD requires its interaction with the nucleolin-RNA complex. We identified NVL2UD, a small globular domain, which contains a “classic” nucleolar localization signal consensus sequence, (R/K)(R/K)X(R/K), in its structured region. Recent studies have shown that the classic description of nucleolar localization signals must be changed and expanded drastically. This results from the complex pathway of the nucleolar localization of proteins, in contrast to the nuclear localization signal (NLS), which encodes the recognition sequence of the dominant NLS receptors, importins. To date, no common NoLS signal recognition molecule has been identified, unlike the importins and exportins for NLS and nuclear export signal. Instead, many proteins involved in the nucleolar protein-protein interaction network is responsible for nucleolar localization (21Emmott E. Hiscox J.A. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Our results revealed that the RRKR motif in NVL2UD plays a role in both nucleolar targeting and retention.
