https://openalex.org/W2530785083,"Zinc oxide nanoparticles (nano-ZnOs) are widely used and possess great potentials in agriculture and biomedicine. It is inevitable for human exposure to these nanoparticles. However, no study had been conducted to investigate the long term effects of nano-ZnOs. This study aimed at investigating effects of nano-ZnOs on development, zinc metabolism and biodistribution of minerals (Zn, Fe, Cu, and Mn) in mice from week 3 to 35. After the characteristics of nano-ZnOs were determined, they were added into the basal diet at 0, 50, 500 and 5000 mg/kg. Results indicated that added 50 and 500 mg/kg nano-ZnOs showed minimal toxicity. However, 5000 mg/kg nano-ZnOs significantly decreased body weight (from week 4 to 16) and increased the relative weights of the pancreas, brain and lung. Added 5000 mg/kg nano-ZnOs significantly increased the serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase activity and zinc content, and significantly enhanced mRNA expression of zinc metabolism-related genes, including metallothionein 1(32.66 folds), metallothionein 2 (31.42 folds), ZIP8 (2.21folds), ZIP14 (2.45 folds), ZnT1 (4.76 folds), ZnT2 (6.19 folds) and ZnT4 (1.82 folds). The biodistribution determination showed that there was a significant accumulation of zinc in the liver, pancreas, kidney, and bones (tibia and fibula) after receiving 5000 mg/kg nano-ZnO diet, while no significant effects on Cu, Fe, and Mn levels, except for liver Fe content and pancreas Mn level. Our results demonstrated that long term exposure to 50 and 500 mg/kg nano-ZnO diets showed minimal toxicity. However, high dose of nano-ZnOs (5000 mg/kg) caused toxicity on development, and altered the zinc metabolism and biodistribution in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2530044565,"The cytokine receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) produced by osteocytes is essential for osteoclast formation in cancellous bone under physiological conditions, and RANKL production by B lymphocytes is required for the bone loss caused by estrogen deficiency. Here, we examined whether RANKL produced by osteocytes is also required for the bone loss caused by estrogen deficiency. Mice lacking RANKL in osteocytes were protected from the increase in osteoclast number and the bone loss caused by ovariectomy. Moreover, these mice did not exhibit the increase in bone marrow B lymphocytes caused by ovariectomy that occurred in control littermates. Deletion of estrogen receptor α from B cells did not alter B cell number or bone mass and did not alter the response to ovariectomy. In addition, lineage-tracing studies demonstrated that B cells do not act as osteoclast progenitors in estrogen-replete or estrogen-deficient mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that RANKL expressed by osteocytes is required for the bone loss as well as the increase in B cell number caused by estrogen deficiency. Moreover, they suggest that estrogen control of B cell number is indirect via osteocytes and that the increase in bone marrow B cells may be a necessary component of the cascade of events that lead to cancellous bone loss during estrogen deficiency. However, the role of B cells is not to act as osteoclast progenitors but may be to act as osteoclast support cells."
https://openalex.org/W2530145254,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensor and master regulator of metabolism. AMPK functions as a fuel gauge monitoring systemic and cellular energy status. Activation of AMPK occurs when the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio increases and leads to a metabolic switch from anabolism to catabolism. AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which catalyzes carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, the first and rate-limiting reaction in de novo synthesis of fatty acids. AMPK thus regulates homeostasis of acetyl-CoA, a key metabolite at the crossroads of metabolism, signaling, chromatin structure, and transcription. Nucleocytosolic concentration of acetyl-CoA affects histone acetylation and links metabolism and chromatin structure. Here we show that activation of AMPK with the widely used antidiabetic drug metformin or with the AMP mimetic 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide increases the inhibitory phosphorylation of ACC and decreases the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, leading to increased protein acetylation and altered gene expression in prostate and ovarian cancer cells. Direct inhibition of ACC with allosteric inhibitor 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid also increases acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins. Because AMPK activation requires liver kinase B1, metformin does not induce protein acetylation in liver kinase B1-deficient cells. Together, our data indicate that AMPK regulates the availability of nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA for protein acetylation and that AMPK activators, such as metformin, have the capacity to increase protein acetylation and alter patterns of gene expression, further expanding the plethora of metformin's physiological effects.

Acetylation is one of the epigenetic post-translational modifications of histones; it affects chromatin structure and regulates diverse cellular functions, such as gene expression, DNA replication and repair, and cellular proliferation (1.Strahl B.D.

Acetylation and deacetylation of chromatin histones, mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 3The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACCA, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α; LKB1, liver kinase B1; AICAR, 5-amino-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide; TOFA, 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein; βOHB, β-hydroxybutyrate; acH3, histone H3 acetylated at Lys14; acH4, hyperacetylated histone H4; acp65, p65 NFκB acetylated at Lys310; acTubulin, tubulin acetylated at Lys40; pAMPK, AMPK phosphorylated at Thr172; pACCA, ACCA phosphorylated at Ser79. and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively, represent the major mechanisms for epigenetic gene regulation. The dynamic balance between histone acetylation and deacetylation, mediated by the activities of HATs and HDACs, is stringently regulated in healthy cells but is often dysregulated in cancer (3.Farria A. Li W. Dent S.Y. KATs in cancer: functions and therapies.Oncogene. 2015; 34: 4901-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 4.Hsu Y.C. Hsieh Y.H. Liao C.C. Chong L.W. Lee C.Y. Yu Y.L. Chou R.H. Targeting post-translational modifications of histones in cancer therapy.Cell. Mol. Biol. 2015; 61: 69-84PubMed Google Scholar). Histone acetylation depends on intermediary metabolism for supplying acetyl-CoA in the nucleocytosolic compartment (5.Takahashi H. McCaffery J.M. Irizarry R.A. Boeke J.D.

Cell. 2006; 23: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the nucleocytosolic enzyme ATP-citrate lyase is the major source of acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation (6.Wellen K.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Sachdeva U.M. Bui T.V. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. ATP-citrate lyase links cellular metabolism to histone acetylation.Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). Another mechanism for generation of acetyl-CoA in the nucleus involves translocation of pyruvate dehydrogenase from mitochondria to the nucleus (7.Sutendra G. Kinnaird A. Dromparis P. Paulin R.

In yeast, global histone acetylation depends on nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA produced by acetyl-CoA synthetase (5.Takahashi H. McCaffery J.M. Irizarry R.A. Boeke J.D.

In both yeast and mammalian cells, the nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA is the link among cellular energy, carbon metabolism, histone acetylation, and chromatin regulation (8.Pietrocola F. Galluzzi L.

Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA is a critical precursor of several anabolic processes, including de novo synthesis of fatty acids. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, the first and rate-limiting reaction in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids (12.Kim K.H. Regulation of mammalian acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The ACC activity affects the concentration of nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA. We have previously shown that attenuated expression of yeast ACC increases global acetylation of chromatin histones and alters transcriptional regulation (13.Galdieri L. Vancura A. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase regulates global histone acetylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23865-23876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, chronic inhibition of ACC in mouse hepatocytes increases protein acetylation (14.Chow J.D. Lawrence R.T. Healy M.E. Dominy J.E. Liao J.A. Breen D.S. Byrne F.L. Kenwood B.M. Lackner C. Okutsu S. Mas V.R. Caldwell S.H. Tomsig J.L. Cooney G.J. Puigserver P.B. et al.Genetic inhibition of hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity increases liver fat and alters global protein acetylation.Mol. Metab. 2014; 3: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The human genome encodes two tissue-specific ACC isoforms, ACCα (ACCA) and ACCβ (ACCB) (15.Travers M.T. Barber M.C. Tissue-specific control of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1215-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). ACCA activity is controlled by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a conserved cellular energy sensor and master regulator of metabolism. A hallmark of AMPK activation is phosphorylation of ACCA at Ser79, which results in reduced activity of ACCA and inhibition of fatty acid synthesis (16.Carling D. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. A common bicyclic protein kinase cascade inactivates the regulatory enzymes of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis.FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 17.Hardie D.G. AMP-activated protein kinase: an energy sensor that regulates all aspects of cell function.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1895-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). In yeast, inactivation of SNF1, the budding yeast ortholog of mammalian AMPK, results in increased ACC activity, a reduced pool of cellular acetyl-CoA, and globally decreased histone acetylation (18.Zhang M. Galdieri L. Vancura A. The yeast AMPK homolog SNF1 regulates acetyl coenzyme A homeostasis and histone acetylation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 4701-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The main objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that inhibition of ACC activity in human cells increases the nucleocytosolic pool of acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation. We show that suppression of ACC activity either by direct inhibition or by metformin-mediated AMPK activation increases acetylation of histones and non-histones proteins and induces transcriptional changes in prostate and ovarian cancer cells. Metformin, widely used for diabetes type 2 treatment, decreases ATP production by inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, leading to AMPK activation (19.El-Mir M.Y. Nogueira V.

Cellular and molecular mechanisms of metformin: an overview.Clin. Sci. 2012; 122: 253-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). The metformin therapy is associated with a reduced risk of cancer in diabetes type 2 patients; however, the mechanisms are not completely understood (24.Evans J.M. Donnelly L.A. Emslie-Smith A.M. Alessi D.R. Morris A.D. Metformin and reduced risk of cancer in diabetic patients.BMJ. 2005; 330: 1304-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that some of the physiological effects of metformin may involve increased acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins and altered patterns of transcriptional regulation. Histone acetylation depends on intermediary metabolism for supplying acetyl-CoA as a substrate for HATs in the nucleocytosolic compartment (5.Takahashi H. McCaffery J.M. Irizarry R.A. Boeke J.D.

ATP-citrate lyase links cellular metabolism to histone acetylation.Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). Cytosolic acetyl-CoA is also used by acetyl-CoA carboxylase to yield malonyl-CoA, a precursor for de novo synthesis of fatty acids (25.Tehlivets O. Scheuringer K. Kohlwein S.D. Fatty acid synthesis and elongation in yeast.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 26.Beld J. Lee D.J. Burkart M.D. Fatty acid biosynthesis revisited: structure elucidation and metabolic engineering.Mol. Biosyst. 2015; 11: 38-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that acetyl-CoA carboxylase Acc1p regulates homeostasis of nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA and acetylation of histones and nonhistone proteins in yeast (13.Galdieri L. Vancura A. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase regulates global histone acetylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23865-23876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ACCA regulates histone acetylation also in mammalian cells, we analyzed histone acetylation in prostate cancer PC3 and ovarian cancer OVCAR3 cells treated with 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA), an allosteric ACCA inhibitor that decreases conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA and induces apoptosis in lung and colon cancer cells (27.Wang C. Xu C. Sun M. Luo D. Liao D.F. Cao D. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α inhibitor TOFA induces human cancer cell apoptosis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 385: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our results show that inhibition of ACCA significantly increases acetylation levels of histones H3 and H4 in PC3 cells and to a lesser extent in OVCAR3 cells (Fig. 1A). In addition to histones, many other proteins are acetylated (3.Farria A. Li W. Dent S.Y. KATs in cancer: functions and therapies.Oncogene. 2015; 34: 4901-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8.Pietrocola F. Galluzzi L. Bravo-San Pedro J.M. Madeo F. Kroemer G. Acetyl coenzyme A: a central metabolite and second messenger.Cell Metab. 2015; 21: 805-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). To determine whether ACCA inhibition selectively affects only histone acetylation or has a similar effect on acetylation of other proteins, we assayed acetylation of α-tubulin and p65 NFκB. α-Tubulin is acetylated at Lys40 by a conserved α-tubulin acetyltransferase, increasing stability of microtubules (28.Al-Bassam J. Corbett K.D. α-Tubulin acetylation from the inside out.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 19515-19516Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The transcription factor NFκB regulates expression of genes involved in inflammation, growth, development, and apoptosis (29.Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Rel/NF-κB/IκB family: intimate tales of association and dissociation.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 30.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. NF-κB and Rel proteins: evolutionarily conserved mediators of immune responses.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4601) Google Scholar). Acetylation of p65 at Lys310 is required for the full transcriptional activity of NFκB (31.Chen L.F. Mu Y. Greene W.C. Acetylation of RelA at discrete sites regulates distinct nuclear functions of NF-κB.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6539-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Our results show that the acetylation levels of α-tubulin and p65 are increased after TOFA treatment in PC3 and OVCAR3 cells without affecting the total cellular levels of these proteins (Fig. 1A). ACCA activity is inhibited by AMPK phosphorylation (32.Davies S.P. Carling D. Munday M.R. Hardie D.G.

Management of cellular energy by the AMP-activated protein kinase system.FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). A hallmark of AMPK activation is ACCA phosphorylation at Ser79, resulting in ACCA inactivation and inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis (35.Ha J. Daniel S. Broyles S.S. Kim K.H. Critical phosphorylation sites for acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22162-22168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that inactivation of the yeast AMPK homolog SNF1 results in a decreased level of nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA, leading to hypoacetylation of chromatin histones and non-histone proteins (18.Zhang M. Galdieri L. Vancura A. The yeast AMPK homolog SNF1 regulates acetyl coenzyme A homeostasis and histone acetylation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 4701-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because SNF1 modulates acetyl-CoA homeostasis in yeast cells, we speculated that activation of AMPK in mammalian cells might decrease ACCA activity, leading to increased acetylation of histones. As expected, stimulation of AMPK in PC3 and OVCAR3 cells with the AMP homolog 5-amino-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR) increased AMPK phosphorylation at Thr172, a hallmark of AMPK activation by liver kinase B1 (LKB1), the primary upstream kinase that activates the AMPK pathway (34.Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. Management of cellular energy by the AMP-activated protein kinase system.FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Activation of AMPK resulted also in phosphorylation of ACCA at Ser79 (Fig. 1B), known to decrease ACCA enzymatic activity (35.Ha J. Daniel S. Broyles S.S. Kim K.H. Critical phosphorylation sites for acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22162-22168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, AMPK activation by AICAR increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4, α-tubulin, and p65 in both PC3 and OVCAR3 cells (Fig. 1B). AMPK can also be activated by drugs that inhibit the mitochondrial electron transport pathway and oxidative phosphorylation and reduce the cellular ATP level. One of these drugs is metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug that inhibits mitochondrial complex I, reducing ATP production and increasing AMP levels (20.Owen M.R. Doran E. Halestrap A.P. Evidence that metformin exerts its anti-diabetic effects through inhibition of complex 1 of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 23.Viollet B. Guigas B. Sanz Garcia N. Leclerc J. Foretz M. Andreelli F. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of metformin: an overview.Clin. Sci. 2012; 122: 253-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Upon AMP binding, AMPK becomes a better substrate for its activator kinase LKB1 (34.Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. Management of cellular energy by the AMP-activated protein kinase system.FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). In PC3 and OVCAR3 cells, metformin activated AMPK as shown by increased AMPK phosphorylation at Thr172 and ACCA phosphorylation at Ser79 (Fig. 2A). In accordance with ACCA inactivation, 0.03 and 0.3 mm metformin decreased cellular malonyl-CoA levels to 80 and 20% compared with untreated cells, respectively (Fig. 2B). Similarly to TOFA and AICAR, treatment of PC3 and OVCAR3 cells with metformin increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4, α-tubulin, and p65 (Fig. 2A). The lowest concentration of metformin effective in increasing protein acetylation was about 30 μm (Fig. 2), which corresponds to the metformin concentration in human plasma following a therapeutic dose of around 30 mg/kg (36.Fogarty S. Hardie D.G. Development of protein kinase activators: AMPK as a target in metabolic disorders and cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Together, our results indicate that, by regulating ACCA activity, AMPK controls acetyl-CoA homeostasis and protein acetylation. To investigate whether activation of AMPK, rather than a modulation of other cellular activities, accounts for the AICAR-induced increase in protein acetylation in PC3 cells, we analyzed global acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins after small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of both AMPKα1 and AMPKα2. As shown in Fig. 3A, AMPK siRNA silencing suppressed the cellular AMPK level by about 50% in untreated cells and by about 70% in AICAR-treated PC3 cells. Cells with suppressed AMPK expression exhibited significantly reduced acetylation of histones H3 and H4, tubulin, and p65 after AICAR treatment (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that activation of AMPK is responsible for the increased protein acetylation. Treatment of PC3 and OVCAR3 cells with TOFA results in increased protein acetylation (Fig. 1A). To confirm that the mechanism responsible involves inhibition of the ACCA activity, we analyzed protein acetylation in PC3 cells transfected with ACCA siRNA as well as with control non-silencing siRNA. Cell transfection with ACCA siRNA suppressed the ACCA protein levels by about 60%. The ACCA suppression significantly increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 as well as increased acetylation of tubulin and p65 (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with the effect of TOFA on protein acetylation (Fig. 1A); we interpret these results to mean that decreased activity of ACCA results in increased protein acetylation. These results are also consistent with increased protein acetylation upon repression of yeast ACC (13.Galdieri L. Vancura A. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase regulates global histone acetylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23865-23876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor serine/threonine LKB1 activates AMPK by phosphorylation at Thr172. LKB1 is a low energy sensor that regulates tumorigenesis and apoptosis by regulating AMPK and mTOR pathways (37.Shaw R.J. Kosmatka M. Bardeesy N. Hurley R.L. Witters L.A. DePinho R.A. Cantley L.C. The tumor suppressor LKB1 kinase directly activates AMP-activated kinase and regulates apoptosis in response to energy stress.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3329-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). LKB1-deficient cells have increased mTOR signaling due to the lack of tuberous sclerosis 2 protein phosphorylation by AMPK, which results in increased growth and tumorigenic potential. To investigate whether metformin-induced protein acetylation requires LKB1-dependent activation of AMPK, we analyzed global protein acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins in PC3 cells transfected with LKB1 siRNA as well as with control non-silencing siRNA. As shown in Fig. 4A, LKB1 siRNA silencing suppressed the cellular LKB1 level by about 80% in untreated cells and by about 95% in metformin-treated PC3 cells. The LKB1 suppression abolished the increase in protein acetylation after metformin treatment (Fig. 4A), suggesting that LKB1 activity is required for metformin-induced protein acetylation. To further investigate the role of LKB1 in metformin-induced protein acetylation, we used HeLa S3 cells that lack LKB1 expression (38.Tiainen M. Ylikorkala A. Mäkelä T.P. Growth suppression by LKB1 is mediated by a G1 cell cycle arrest.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9248-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Metformin did not induce AMPK phosphorylation at Thr172 or ACCA phosphorylation at Ser79 and did not increase acetylation of histones H3 and H4, α-tubulin, and p65 in HeLa S3 cells (Fig. 4B). However, inhibition of ACCA with TOFA in HeLa S3 cells increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4, α-tubulin, and p65 (Fig. 4C). Taken together, our results suggest that the metformin-induced protein acetylation in PC3 and OVCAR3 cells is due to the LKB1-dependent activation of AMPK and AMPK-dependent inactivation of ACCA. To test whether metformin regulates histone acetylation globally or only at specific loci, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to evaluate the occupancy of histone H3 acetylated at Lys14 (acH3) as well as hyperacetylated histone H4 (acH4; acetylated at Lys5,8,12,16) in the promoter regions of β-actin (ACTB), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, apoptosis regulator Bcl-2, proinflammatory genes IL6 and IL8, the transcription factor Bcl-3, the transcriptionally inactive euchromatin gene MYOD1 encoding myogenic differentiation 1 protein, and the transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin gene SAT2 encoding spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase. We used anti-H3 antibody that recognizes the C-terminal region of histone H3, which is not post-translationally modified. The ChIP signal obtained with this antibody thus represents the total H3 occupancy and can be used to calculate the histone acetylation levels per nucleosome content (18.Zhang M. Galdieri L. Vancura A. The yeast AMPK homolog SNF1 regulates acetyl coenzyme A homeostasis and histone acetylation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 4701-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To account for differences in nucleosome density at different genomic loci, we corrected the acH3 and acH4 occupancies for histone H3 content and generated values that represent acetylation per nucleosome. In metformin-treated PC3 cells, acetylation of histone H3 was increased 4- and 10-fold in the promoters of IL8 and IL6, respectively. The acetylation status of histone H3 in the other promoters was not altered. Acetylation of histone H4 was increased 1.3–7.5 times in all examined promoters (Fig. 5). Upon treatment of PC3 cells with AICAR, acetylation of histone H3 was increased 2–3.4 times in the promoters of p21, IL8, ACTB, and Bcl2, whereas acetylation of histone H4 was increased 1.2–5.2 times in all examined promoters (Fig. 6). The fact that the increased acetylation of histone H4 was not always accompanied by increased acetylation of histone H3 is in an agreement with the notion that different acetylation levels of histones H3 and H4 are due to different affinity of individual HATs for acetyl-CoA (8.Pietrocola F.

https://openalex.org/W2530553690,"Vitamin B6 includes six water-soluble vitamers: pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxamine (PM), pyridoxine (PN), and their phosphorylated forms. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is an important cofactor for many metabolic enzymes. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that blood levels of PLP are significantly lower in patients with inflammation than in control subjects and that vitamin B6 has anti-inflammatory effects, with therapeutic potential for a variety of inflammatory diseases. Although one of our group previously demonstrated that PL inhibits the NF-κB pathway, the molecular mechanism by which vitamin B6 suppresses inflammation is not well understood. Here, we showed that both PL and PLP suppressed the expression of cytokine genes in macrophages by inhibiting Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated TAK1 phosphorylation and the subsequent NF-κB and JNK activation. Furthermore, PL and PLP abolished NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 processing and the subsequent secretion of mature IL-1β and IL-18 in LPS-primed macrophages. In contrast, PM and PN had little effect on IL-1β production. PLP, but not PL, markedly reduced the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in peritoneal macrophages. Importantly, PL and PLP reduced IL-1β production induced by LPS and ATP, or by LPS alone, in mice. Moreover, PL and PLP protected mice from lethal endotoxic shock. Collectively, these findings reveal novel anti-inflammatory activities for vitamin B6 and suggest its potential for preventing inflammatory diseases driven by the NLRP3 inflammasome."

Recently, the entire structure of O-mannosyl glycan, [3GlcAβ1-3Xylα1]n-3GlcAβ1-4Xyl-Rbo5P-1Rbo5P-3GalNAcβ1-3GlcNAcβ1-4 (phospho-6)Manα1-, which is required for the binding of α-DG to extracellular matrix ligands, has been proposed. However, the linkage of the first Xyl residue to ribitol 5-phosphate (Rbo5P) is not clear. TMEM5 is a gene product responsible for α-dystroglycanopathy and was reported as a potential enzyme involved in this linkage formation, although the experimental evidence is still incomplete. Here, we report that TMEM5 is a xylosyltransferase that forms the Xylβ1-4Rbo5P linkage on O-mannosyl glycan. The anomeric configuration and linkage position of the product (β1,4 linkage) was determined by NMR analysis. The introduction of two missense mutations in TMEM5 found in α-dystroglycanopathy patients impaired xylosyltransferase activity. Furthermore, the disruption of the TMEM5 gene by CRISPR/Cas9 abrogated the elongation of the (-3GlcAβ1-3Xylα1-) unit on O-mannosyl glycan. Based on these results, we concluded that TMEM5 acts as a UDP-d-xylose:ribitol-5-phosphate β1,4-xylosyltransferase in the biosynthetic pathway of O-mannosyl glycan."
https://openalex.org/W2530527282,"Previous research on humans and animals suggests that the analysis of sleep patterns may reliably inform us about welfare status, but little research of this kind has been carried out for non-human animals in an applied context. This study explored the use of sleep and resting behaviour as indicators of welfare by describing the activity patterns of dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) housed in rescue shelters, and comparing their sleep patterns to other behavioural and cognitive measures of welfare. Sleep and activity patterns were observed over five non-consecutive days in a population of 15 dogs. Subsequently, the characteristics of sleep and resting behaviour were described and the impact of activity on patterns of sleep and resting behaviour analysed. Shelter dogs slept for 2.8% of the day, 14.3% less than previously reported and experienced less sleep fragmentation at night (32 sleep bouts). There were no statistically significant relationships between behaviours exhibited during the day and sleep behaviour. A higher proportion of daytime resting behaviour was significantly associated with a positive judgement bias, less repetitive behaviour and increased time spent coded as ‘relaxed’ across days by shelter staff. These results suggest that, in the context of a busy shelter environment, the ability to rest more during the day could be a sign of improved welfare. Considering the non-linear relationship between sleep and welfare in humans, the relationship between sleep and behavioural indicators of welfare, including judgement bias, in shelter dogs may be more complex than this study could detect."
https://openalex.org/W2530492717,"Most satiety-inducing obesity therapeutics, despitemodest efficacy, have safety concerns that underscore the need for effective peripherally acting drugs. An attractive therapeutic approach for obesity is to optimize/ maximize energy expenditure by increasing energy-utilizing thermogenic brown adipose tissue. We used in vivo and in vitro models to determine the role of estrogen receptor β (ER-β) and its ligands on adipose biology. RNA sequencing and metabolomics were used to determine the mechanism of action of ER-β and its ligands. Estrogen receptor b (ER-β) and its selective ligand reprogrammed preadipocytes and precursor stemcells into brown adipose tissue and increased mitochondrial respiration. An ER-β-selective ligand increased markers of tricarboxylic acid– dependent and–independent energybiogenesis andoxygen consumption inmicewithout a concomitant increase in physical activity or food consumption, all culminating in significantly reduced weight gain and adiposity. The antiobesity effects of ER-β ligand were not observed in ER-β-knockout mice. Serum metabolite profiles of adult lean and juvenile micewere comparable, while that of adult obesemicewas distinct, indicating a possible impact of obesity on age-dependentmetabolism. This phenotypewas partially reversed by ER-β-selective ligand. These data highlight a new role for ER-β in adipose biology and its potential to be a safer alternative peripheral therapeutic target for obesity.—Ponnusamy, S., Tran, Q.T., Harvey, I., Smallwood, H.

Their closest relatives are often well-known species from various biotopes with significant pathogenic potential. Speleothems represent a unique rock-dwelling habitat, whose mycobiota are largely unexplored. Isolation of fungi from speleothem biofilm covering bare granite walls in the Kungsträdgården metro station in Stockholm yielded axenic cultures of two distinct black yeast morphotypes. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences from six nuclear loci, ITS, nuc18S and nuc28S rDNA, rpb1, rpb2 and β-tubulin, support their placement in the Chaetothyriales (Ascomycota). They are described as a new genus Bacillicladium with the type species B. lobatum, and a new species Bradymyces graniticola. Bacillicladium is distantly related to the known five chaetothyrialean families and is unique in the Chaetothyriales by variable morphology showing hyphal, meristematic and yeast-like growth in vitro. The nearest relatives of Bacillicladium are recruited among fungi isolated from cardboard-like construction material produced by arboricolous non-attine ants. Their sister relationship is weakly supported by the Maximum likelihood analysis, but strongly supported by Bayesian inference. The genus Bradymyces is placed amidst members of the Trichomeriaceae and is ecologically undefined; it includes an opportunistic animal pathogen while two other species inhabit rock surfaces. ITS rDNA sequences of three species accepted in Bradymyces and other undescribed species and environmental samples were subjected to phylogenetic analysis and in-depth comparative analysis of ITS1 and ITS2 secondary structures in order to study their intraspecific variability. Compensatory base change criterion in the ITS2 secondary structure supported delimitation of species in Bradymyces, which manifest a limited number of phenotypic features useful for species recognition. The role of fungi in the speleothem biofilm and relationships of Bacillicladium and Bradymyces with other members of the Chaetothyriales are discussed."

Hypotonic stress increased transepithelial electrical resistance, which was inhibited by SB202190. The mRNA expression level of claudin-1 was decreased by hypotonic stress but that of claudin-2 was not. Hypotonic stress decreased the protein stability of claudin-1 and -2. The hypotonicity-induced decrease in claudin expression was inhibited by the following: chloroquine, a lysosome inhibitor; dynasore and monodansylcadaverine, clathrin-dependent endocytosis inhibitors; and siRNA against clathrin heavy chain. Claudin-1 and -2 were mainly distributed in the cytosol and tight junctions (TJs) in the chloroquine- and monodansylcadaverine-treated cells, respectively. Hypotonic stress decreased the phosphorylation levels of claudin-1 and -2, which were inhibited by the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and cantharidin. Dephosphorylated mutants of claudin-1 and -2 were mainly distributed in the cytosol, which disappeared in response to hypotonic stress. In contrast, mimicking phosphorylation mutants were distributed in the TJs, which were not decreased by hypotonic stress. We suggest that hypotonic stress induces dephosphorylation, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and degradation of claudin-1 and -2 in lysosomes, resulting in disruption of the TJ barrier in renal tubular epithelial cells."

An unusual feature of LYVE-1 not found in other HA receptors is the potential to form disulfide-linked homodimers. However, their influence on function has not been investigated. Here we show LYVE-1 homodimers are the predominant configuration in lymphatic endothelium in vitro and in vivo, and formation solely requires the unpaired cysteine residue Cys-201 within the membrane-proximal domain, yielding a 15-fold higher HA binding affinity and an ∼67-fold slower off-rate than the monomer. Moreover, we show non-dimerizing LYVE-1 mutants fail to bind HA even when expressed at high densities in lymphatic endothelial cells or artificially cross-linked with antibody. Consistent with these findings, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicates the Cys-201 interchain disulfide forms a hinge that maintains the homodimer in an “open scissors” conformation, likely allowing arrangement of the two HA binding domains for mutual engagement with ligand.

Although this domain contains an HA binding surface of similar dimensions to that of CD44, the HA interaction is markedly distinct insofar as it is likely dominated by charged rather than hydrophobic residues and exhibits a weaker binding affinity that results in dissociation even at relatively low ionic strength (10.Banerji S.

In common with CD44, recombinant LYVE-1 in some transfected cell types binds HA efficiently, whereas in others binding is suppressed due in part to receptor sialylation that appears to block the interaction with ligand (5.Jackson D.G.

Most notably, LYVE-1 in native lymphatic endothelium displays little if any detectable binding to high molecular weight (HMW) HA, a seemingly paradoxical feature that initially suggested the receptor might be largely inactive in vivo. Just recently, however, we reported that native LYVE-1 is fully functional in this respect, although only when expressed above a critical surface threshold density or grouped in discrete surface microclusters (13.Lawrance W.

These various findings have reinforced the notion that LYVE-1 is a tightly regulated and physiologically important receptor and that its inherently low affinity for HA confers a dependence on multivalent interactions for durable binding through avidity (15.Jackson D.G. Lymphatic regulation of cell trafficking.J. Clin. Cell. Immunol. 2014; 5: 258-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One intriguing feature of LYVE-1 that has received little attention but which has potentially important consequences for HA binding is its potential to form disulfide-linked homodimers. Unlike the other major Link superfamily HA receptors CD44 and the liver sinusoidal receptor known as Stabilin-2 or HARE (16.Harris E.N. Kyosseva S.V. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H.

Indeed, this feature delineates the receptor from all other Link module superfamily members, which function as single chain HA-binding proteins, albeit in some cases composed of tandemly repeated Link modules (8.Day A.J. Prestwich G.D. Hyaluronan-binding proteins: tying up the giant.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4585-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Here we have evaluated the capacity of LYVE-1 to form homodimers in native lymphatic endothelium and investigated the significance of dimerization in terms of its consequences for HA binding affinity and receptor function in this context. We identify Cys-201 as the critical cysteine residue generating the interchain disulfide and show by means of Biacore analysis that homodimer formation compensates for the inherently weak affinity of the LYVE-1 monomer and enhances HA binding some ×15-fold. Moreover, we reveal that disruption of the Cys-201 disulfide bridge in the homodimer by site-directed mutagenesis ablates HA binding in primary lymphatic endothelial cells and that binding cannot be reconstituted by the monomer even at the highest levels of surface expression or by artificial cross-linking with LYVE-1 antibody. In addition, we present structure-based evidence from small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of LYVE-1 ectodomains that the Cys-201 intermolecular disulfide forms a hinge that maintains the homodimer in a splayed open scissors conformation that may well orient the two monomer HA binding domains for optimal engagement with ligand. Lastly, we present evidence that the Cys-201 interchain disulfide within the native LYVE-1 homodimer is highly labile, suggesting that dimerization and hence HA binding may be influenced by the extracellular redox microenvironment. These findings uncover additional, unexpected layers of complexity in the regulation of LYVE-1 HA interactions and attest to their functional importance in supporting HA-mediated interactions in the lymphatic compartment. The original cloning and sequencing of hLYVE-1 cDNA revealed a single unpaired cysteine (Cys-201) near the base of the O-glycosylated membrane stalk region that is conserved in all vertebrate sequences with the exception of fish and Amphibia (4.Banerji S.

However, no studies to date have addressed the biochemical properties of LYVE-1 homodimers, their expression in normal tissue, or their significance for receptor function. To characterize disulfide-linked homodimer formation by native LYVE-1, we first compared the mobility of the receptor in whole cell lysates of primary human dermal endothelial cells (HDLEC) subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions followed by Western blotting with polyclonal LYVE-1 antibody. Under non-reducing conditions, shown in Fig. 1, B and C, the receptor migrated as two broad bands of almost equal intensity with apparent molecular masses ranging between 60–80 and 120–180 kDa, corresponding to mixed glycoforms of the monomer and its disulfide-linked homodimer, whereas only the 60–80-kDa receptor was present under reducing conditions with 2-mercaptoethanol. Significantly, however, when the thiol-modifying agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was included during HDLEC lysis the majority of the receptor (80% as determined by quantitative densitometry) migrated as the 120–180-kDa dimer form (Fig. 1, B and C). This result suggests that dermal LEC synthesize predominantly LYVE-1 homodimers, but these are highly susceptible to reduction by endogenous thiol-based antioxidants released during cell lysis. A similar preponderance of LYVE-1 homodimers (80–90%) was detected in samples of freshly resected mouse ear skin and lymph node (Fig. 1D), confirming they also represent the dominant form of the receptor in lymphatic endothelium in vivo. In contrast, mouse liver and lung tissue in which LYVE-1 is expressed mostly in hepatic sinusoids and pulmonary blood vessels (4.Banerji S. Ni J. Wang S.X. Clasper S. Su J. Tammi R. Jones M. Jackson D.G. LYVE-1, a new homologue of the CD44 glycoprotein, is a lymph-specific receptor for hyaluronan.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 11.Prevo R. Banerji S. Ferguson D.J. Clasper S. Jackson D.G. Mouse LYVE-1 is an endocytic receptor for hyaluronan in lymphatic endothelium.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19420-19430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) contained heterogeneous (∼2:1) mixtures of homodimer and monomer. This was also the case for LYVE-1 in transfected Jurkat and COS7 cells despite the inclusion of NEM (Fig. 1E). The variation in apparent molecular weight ranges of both monomer and homodimer between these different cell and tissue types reflects the influence of lineage-specific glycosylation patterns, as outlined previously (19.Nightingale T.D. Frayne M.E. Clasper S. Banerji S. Jackson D.G. A mechanism of sialylation functionally silences the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 in lymphatic endothelium.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3935-3945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These results reveal that LYVE-1 is expressed preferentially as homodimers in native human and mouse lymphatic endothelium but that the dimer:monomer ratio can vary between cell types and tissues, likely as a result of diverse redox environments and innate cell-based differences in biosynthesis. Next, to formally identify the residue constituting the LYVE-1 intermolecular disulfide as either Cys-201 or one of the two additional conserved residues Cys-257 or Cys-317 present in the transmembrane anchor and cytoplasmic tail respectively, we constructed a hLYVE-1 mutant, C201A, converting cysteine to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. This was then compared with wild-type hLYVE-1 for its ability to form covalent dimers in transfected HEK 293T cells as assessed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. The results (Fig. 1F) showed the wild-type receptor formed mostly 120–160-kDa dimers as expected, (2:1 dimer:monomer ratio), whereas the C201A mutant formed no dimers and was exclusively monomeric. Furthermore, a soluble hLYVE-1 ectodomain construct encompassing Cys-201 (hLYVE-1 Δ238 His10) but lacking the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail formed similar dimer:monomer mixtures indicating these components are not required to form the intermolecular disulfide. Previously, we showed that LYVE-1 extracellular domains expressed as immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins display only low to intermediate binding affinity for HA when estimated by either conventional plate binding assays or surface plasmon resonance (10.Banerji S. Hide B.R. James J.R. Noble M.E. Jackson D.G. Distinctive properties of the hyaluronan-binding domain in the lymphatic endothelial receptor Lyve-1 and their implications for receptor function.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10724-10735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, an important caveat of this expression method is that the incorporated Fc tag forces artificial dimerization via the constituent disulfide bridge in the Ig hinge region, a factor that likely influences measured binding affinities through avidity effects. Furthermore, the LYVE-1 partners within these IgFc fusion proteins comprise a mixture of unlinked and disulfide-linked species. Hence, to allow differentiation of the two species we employed an alternative strategy of expressing mature LYVE-1 ectodomains as soluble proteins fused to a C-terminal His10 tag using a glutamine synthase-based amplification system in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, a background that elicits partial but incomplete sialylation of LYVE-1 (19.Nightingale T.D. Frayne M.E. Clasper S. Banerji S. Jackson D.G. A mechanism of sialylation functionally silences the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 in lymphatic endothelium.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3935-3945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and is, therefore, compatible with these HA binding studies. As expected, the LYVE-1 proteins recovered from CHO cell supernatants contained a mixed population of monomers and disulfide-linked dimers (see Fig. 1) that was then subjected to multiple rounds of size exclusion chromatography to separate the two species. For our initial studies the resulting LYVE-1 monomer preparation was subjected to alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide to inhibit post-separation dimer formation. However, in subsequent studies we expressed LYVE-1 as the non-dimerizing C201A mutant to avoid the potential off-target effects of exposure to the thiol modification reagent. As shown in Fig. 2A, the isolated LYVE-1 homodimers and C201A monomers migrated as single bands with approximate molecular masses in the range of 120 and 60–80 kDa, respectively, on SDS-PAGE. In addition, the purity of the preparations was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography, which yielded a single major peak in each case (Fig. 2B). Notably, the homodimer and monomer peaks eluted at similar positions to the 200- and 150-kDa calibration markers, respectively, indicating larger hydrodynamic volumes than would have been anticipated from the predicted molecular mass, most likely due to the influence of the highly glycosylated stalk-like juxtamembrane domain (19.Nightingale T.D. Frayne M.E. Clasper S. Banerji S. Jackson D.G. A mechanism of sialylation functionally silences the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 in lymphatic endothelium.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3935-3945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These purified proteins served as analytes for HMW (end-biotinylated) HA immobilized on a streptavidin-coated Biacore sensor chip. As shown in Fig. 2C, the non-dimerizing C201A monomer bound to HA with fast kinetics, reaching equilibrium within 5s. This enabled the affinity to be measured directly, yielding a mean KD value of 124 ± 8 μm by equilibrium binding analysis, although the binding kinetics were too fast for accurate measurement of individual rate constants. In contrast, the LYVE-1 homodimer bound HA with much slower kinetics (Fig. 2D), failing to reach equilibrium even after 10 min and necessitating the use of kinetic measurements for estimation of apparent KD. Accordingly, the bivalent analyte model (provided by the Biacore T200 evaluation software) was fitted to the experimental data, providing estimates for the first step solution on-rate (k1on =0.0692 μm−1s−1), the second step on-rate (k2on = 7.46 μm−1s−1), and the monovalent off-rate (koff = 8.55 s−1) Next, we derived an expression for the apparent dissociation constant representing half-maximal surface ligand occupancy (see the supplemental information), which yielded a KD = 8.2 μm, indicating that binding of the dimer was some 15-fold “tighter” compared to the monomer on a per molecule basis. We also derived an expression for the effective off-rate of bivalent LYVE-1 to obtain a k*off value of 0.128 s−1, which is 67-fold slower than the monovalent off-rate. The magnitude of this difference indicates that even a small change in the proportion of LYVE-1 dimer in LECs, elicited e.g. by an alteration in extracellular redox potential, could shift the balance between transient and more stable binding of appropriate HA complexes or HA encapsulated pathogens in vivo. Moreover, the ∼×100-fold faster second step on-rate (k2on) for HA binding compared with k1on might suggest some cooperativity between the two constituent HA binding units in the homodimer. To further validate the binding affinities for LYVE-1 monomers and homodimers obtained from the above Biacore analyses, we performed analogous binding studies in the reverse orientation by immobilizing fixed quantities of either LYVE-1 monomer or homodimer in wells of a microtiter plate and applying increasing concentrations of soluble HMW biotinylated HA (bHA) for subsequent detection using streptavidin. As shown in Fig. 2E, the amount of HA bound by the homodimer was much greater than that bound by monomer for all concentrations of HA tested, further substantiating the finding of a higher binding affinity for the LYVE-1 homodimer in the Biacore studies. The magnitude of the increase in HA binding affinity and the observation of a 10-fold faster second step on-rate suggested that LYVE-1 homodimerization might juxtapose the two constituent HABDs in such a way as to synergize their interaction with the bound glycosaminoglycan. To obtain initial information on the three-dimensional structure of the LYVE-1 homodimer, we subjected purified preparations of LYVE-1 monomer and dimer to SAXS analysis. An evaluation of the resulting scattering data led to derivation of the ab initio models shown in Fig. 3, A–C, which indicated rod-like structures of ∼16 nm in length for the monomer and ∼24 nm for the homodimer, respectively, with a kink at one or both ends. The rod-like models are consistent with an extended conformation in the highly glycosylated membrane stalk region. This observation was further supported by vector length distribution analyses, which yielded highly asymmetric distributions in each case, typical of elongated structures (Fig. 3F). Fitting monomers to the model for the homodimer (Fig. 3D) indicated that the most likely arrangement is an anti-parallel orientation in which the two HA binding domains are located at opposite ends of the dimer with a considerable amount of overlap between the mid and C-terminal portions of the stalk region (Fig. 3E). Such an arrangement infers a degree of rotational freedom around the interchain disulfide at Cys-201 and an open-scissor like structure for the receptor dimer (Fig. 3G). Curiously, were this arrangement to be recapitulated in the full-length LYVE-1 homodimer at the cell surface, it would adopt a splayed, flattened structure with the HA binding domains lying closer to the surface of the plasma membrane than would be the case if the extracellular regions were arranged in an extended (closed scissors) parallel conformation (Fig. 3H). To determine whether the influence of LYVE-1 homodimerization on HA binding affinity was also manifest in the intact receptor in primary HDLEC, we transduced cells with either full-length wild-type LYVE-1 or the non-dimerizing C201A mutant in the lentiviral vector pHR using C-terminal GFP tagging to allow distinction of exogenous and endogenous receptor. Confirming our recent findings (13.Lawrance W. Banerji S. Day A.J. Bhattacharjee S. Jackson D.G. Binding of hyaluronan to the native lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor LYVE-1 is critically dependent on receptor surface clustering and hyaluronan organisation.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 8014-8030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), overexpression of wild-type LYVE-1 by this method yielded sufficiently high receptor levels to support efficient binding of HMW bHA (Fig. 4A). Remarkably, however, equivalent expression of the C201A mutant yielded little if any bHA binding, demonstrating homodimer formation is critical for such function, even at high LYVE-1 densities (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, when the C201A supertransfectants were treated with the LYVE-1 cross-linking mAb 8C that triggers a dramatic increase in HA binding of wild-type (dimeric) receptor through receptor clustering (13.Lawrance W. Banerji S. Day A.J. Bhattacharjee S. Jackson D.G.

This population likely reflects cross-linking of the GFP-tagged C201A mutant and the less abundant endogenous wild-type homodimer. These results provide firm evidence that the formation of LYVE-1 covalent homodimers is obligatory for stable HA binding in lymphatic endothelium. Importantly, they also imply that the Cys-201 intermolecular disulfide stabilizes a particular conformation within the homodimer that is critical for HA binding and that cannot be achieved through non-covalent monomer-monomer interactions, as non-dimerizing mutants were largely unable to engage the glycosaminoglycan, even when expressed"

We hypothesized that hyperglycemia-mediated decrease in ALDH2 activity may impair mitochondrial respiration and ultimately result in cardiac damage. A single dose (65 mg/kg; i.p.) streptozotocin injection to rats resulted in hyperglycemia with blood glucose levels of 443 ± 9 mg/dl versus 121 ± 7 mg/dl in control animals, p<0.0001, N = 7–11. After 6 months of diabetes mellitus (DM) induction, the rats were sacrificed after recording the functionality of their hearts. Increase in the cardiomyocyte cross sectional area (446 ± 32 μm2 Vs 221 ± 10 μm2; p<0.0001) indicated cardiac hypertrophy in DM rats. Both diastolic and systolic dysfunctions were observed with DM rats compared to controls. Most importantly, myocardial ALDH2 activity and levels were reduced, and immunostaining for 4HNE protein adducts was increased in DM hearts compared to controls. The mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), an index of mitochondrial respiration, was decreased in mitochondria isolated from DM hearts compared to controls (p<0.0001). Furthermore, the rate of mitochondrial respiration and the increase in carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP)-induced maximal respiration were also decreased with chronic hyperglycemia. Chronic hyperglycemia reduced mitochondrial OXPHOS proteins. Reduced ALDH2 activity was correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction, pathological remodeling and cardiac dysfunction, respectively. Our results suggest that chronic hyperglycemia reduces ALDH2 activity, leading to mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and consequently cardiac damage and dysfunction."

The molecular mechanism of fruit ripening regulation by the Nor gene is unclear. To elucidate how the Nor gene can affect ripening and fruit quality at the protein level, we used the fruits of Nor mutants and wild-type Ailsa Craig (AC) to perform iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) analysis. The Nor mutation altered tomato fruit ripening and affected quality in various respects, including ethylene biosynthesis by down-regulating the abundance of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (ACO), pigment biosynthesis by repressing phytoene synthase 1 (PSY1), ζ-carotene isomerase (Z-ISO), chalcone synthase 1 (CHS1) and other proteins, enhancing fruit firmness by increasing the abundance of cellulose synthase protein, while reducing those of polygalacturonase 2 (PG2) and pectate lyase (PL), altering biosynthesis of nutrients such as carbohydrates, amino acids, and anthocyanins. Conversely, Nor mutation also enhanced the fruit’s resistance to some pathogens by up-regulating the expression of several genes associated with stress and defense. Therefore, the Nor gene is involved in the regulation of fruit ripening and quality. It is useful in the future as a means to improve fruit quality in tomato."

Muscle growth is negatively regulated by myostatin (MSTN) and activins. Blockage of these pathways may improve muscle quality and function in DMD. Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) were designed specifically to block the function of ALK4, a key receptor for the MSTN/activin pathway in skeletal muscle. AON-induced exon skipping resulted in specific Alk4 down-regulation, inhibition of MSTN activity, and increased myoblast differentiation in vitro Unexpectedly, a marked decrease in muscle mass (10%) was found after Alk4 AON treatment in mdx mice. In line with in vitro results, muscle regeneration was stimulated, and muscle fiber size decreased markedly. Notably, when Alk4 was down-regulated in adult wild-type mice, muscle mass decreased even more. RNAseq analysis revealed dysregulated metabolic functions and signs of muscle atrophy. We conclude that ALK4 inhibition increases myogenesis but also regulates the tight balance of protein synthesis and degradation. Therefore, caution must be used when developing therapies that interfere with MSTN/activin pathways.-Pasteuning-Vuhman, S., Boertje-van der Meulen, J.

https://openalex.org/W2530544712,"Coastal ecosystems experience a wide range of stressors including wave forces, storm surge, sea-level rise, and anthropogenic modification and are thus vulnerable to erosion. Urban coastal ecosystems are especially important due to the large populations these limited ecosystems serve. However, few studies have addressed the issue of urban coastal vulnerability at the landscape scale with spatial data that are finely resolved. The purpose of this study was to model and map coastal vulnerability and the role of natural habitats in reducing vulnerability in Jamaica Bay, New York, in terms of nine coastal vulnerability metrics (relief, wave exposure, geomorphology, natural habitats, exposure, exposure with no habitat, habitat role, erodible shoreline, and surge) under past (1609), current (2015), and future (2080) scenarios using InVEST 3.2.0. We analyzed vulnerability results both spatially and across all time periods, by stakeholder (ownership) and by distance to damage from Hurricane Sandy. We found significant differences in vulnerability metrics between past, current and future scenarios for all nine metrics except relief and wave exposure. The marsh islands in the center of the bay are currently vulnerable. In the future, these islands will likely be inundated, placing additional areas of the shoreline increasingly at risk. Significant differences in vulnerability exist between stakeholders; the Breezy Point Cooperative and Gateway National Recreation Area had the largest erodible shoreline segments. Significant correlations exist for all vulnerability (exposure/surge) and storm damage combinations except for exposure and distance to artificial debris. Coastal protective features, ranging from storm surge barriers and levees to natural features (e.g. wetlands), have been promoted to decrease future flood risk to communities in coastal areas around the world. Our methods of combining coastal vulnerability results with additional data and across multiple time periods have considerable potential to provide valuable predictions that resource managers can effectively use to identify areas for restoration and protection."
https://openalex.org/W2531604887,"Recent three-dimensional structural studies reveal that the central domain of ryanodine receptor (RyR) serves as a transducer that converts long-range conformational changes into the gating of the channel pore. Interestingly, the central domain encompasses one of the mutation hotspots (corresponding to amino acid residues 3778–4201) that contains a number of cardiac RyR (RyR2) mutations associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the functional consequences of these central domain RyR2 mutations are not well understood. To gain insights into the impact of the mutation and the role of the central domain in channel function, we generated and characterized eight disease-associated RyR2 mutations in the central domain. We found that all eight central domain RyR2 mutations enhanced the Ca2+-dependent activation of [3H]ryanodine binding, increased cytosolic Ca2+-induced fractional Ca2+ release, and reduced the activation and termination thresholds for spontaneous Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells. We also showed that racemic carvedilol and the non-beta-blocking carvedilol enantiomer, (R)-carvedilol, suppressed spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in HEK293 cells expressing the central domain RyR2 mutations associated with CPVT and AF. These data indicate that the central domain is an important determinant of cytosolic Ca2+ activation of RyR2. These results also suggest that altered cytosolic Ca2+ activation of RyR2 represents a common defect of RyR2 mutations associated with CPVT and AF, which could potentially be suppressed by carvedilol or (R)-carvedilol."
https://openalex.org/W2530020086,"It is a crucial and fundamental issue to identify a small subset of influential spreaders that can control the spreading process in networks. In previous studies, a degree-based heuristic called DegreeDiscount has been shown to effectively identify multiple influential spreaders and has severed as a benchmark method. However, the basic assumption of DegreeDiscount is not adequate, because it treats all the nodes equally without any differences. To consider a general situation in real world networks, a novel heuristic method named GeneralizedDegreeDiscount is proposed in this paper as an effective extension of original method. In our method, the status of a node is defined as a probability of not being influenced by any of its neighbors, and an index generalized discounted degree of one node is presented to measure the expected number of nodes it can influence. Then the spreaders are selected sequentially upon its generalized discounted degree in current network. Empirical experiments are conducted on four real networks, and the results show that the spreaders identified by our approach are more influential than several benchmark methods. Finally, we analyze the relationship between our method and three common degree-based methods."

Interaction of viral nucleocapsid protein (N) with this conserved sequence facilitates mRNA translation by a unique N-mediated translation strategy. Whereas this evolutionarily conserved sequence facilitates virus replication with the assistance of N in eukaryotic hosts having multifaceted antiviral defense, we demonstrate its interaction with N presents a novel target for therapeutic intervention of hantavirus disease. Using a high throughput screening approach, we identified three lead inhibitors that bind and induce structural perturbations in N. The inhibitors interrupt N-RNA interaction and abrogate both viral genomic RNA synthesis and N-mediated translation strategy without affecting the canonical translation machinery of the host cell. The inhibitors are well tolerated by cells and inhibit hantavirus replication with the same potency as ribavarin, a commercially available antiviral. We report the identification of a unique chemical scaffold that disrupts a critical RNA-protein interaction in hantaviruses and holds promise for the development of the first anti-hantaviral therapeutic with broad spectrum antiviral activity."

This method consists in quantifying the impact of fungal exudates on detached leaves by measuring the induced electrolyte leakage (EL%). The tested exudates were either crude culture filtrates from diverse C. cassiicola isolates or the purified cassiicolin (Cas1), a small secreted effector protein produced by the aggressive isolate CCP. The test was found to be quantitative, with the EL% response proportional to toxin concentration. For eight clones tested with two aggressive isolates, the EL% response to the filtrates positively correlated to the response induced by conidial inoculation. The toxicity test applied to 18 clones using 13 toxinic treatments evidenced an important variability among clones and treatments, with a significant additional clone x treatment interaction effect. A genetic linkage map was built using 306 microsatellite markers, from the F1 population of the PB260 x RRIM600 family. Phenotyping of the population for sensitivity to the purified Cas1 effector and to culture filtrates from seven C. cassiicola isolates revealed a polygenic determinism, with six QTL detected on five chromosomes and percentages of explained phenotypic variance varying from 11 to 17%. Two common QTL were identified for the CCP filtrate and the purified cassiicolin, suggesting that Cas1 may be the main effector of CCP filtrate toxicity. The CCP filtrate clearly contrasted with all other filtrates. The toxicity test based on Electrolyte Leakage Measurement offers the opportunity to assess the sensitivity of rubber genotypes to C. cassiicola exudates or purified effectors for genetic investigations and early selection, without risk of spreading the fungus in plantations.

https://openalex.org/W2531370060,"Signaling mechanisms that regulate mammary stem/progenitor cell (MaSC) self-renewal are essential for developmental changes that occur in the mammary gland during pregnancy, lactation, and involution. We observed that equine MaSCs (eMaSCs) maintain their growth potential in culture for an indefinite period, whereas canine MaSCs (cMaSCs) lose their growth potential in long term cultures. We then used this system to investigate the role of microvesicles (MVs) in promoting self-renewal properties. We found that Wnt3a and Wnt1 were expressed at higher levels in MVs isolated from eMaSCs compared with those from cMaSCs. Furthermore, eMaSC-MVs were able to induce Wnt/β-catenin signaling in different target cells, including cMaSCs. Interestingly, the induction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cMaSCs was prolonged when using eMaSC-MVs compared with recombinant Wnt proteins, indicating that MVs are not only important for transport of Wnt proteins, but they also enhance their signaling activity. Finally, we demonstrate that the eMaSC-MVs-mediated activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in cMaSCs significantly improves the ability of cMaSCs to grow as mammospheres and, importantly, that this effect is abolished when eMaSC-MVs are treated with Wnt ligand inhibitors. This suggests that this novel form of intercellular communication plays an important role in self-renewal."

Soy protein isolate (SPI) may be one such dietary factor that promotes bone accretion during early life with persistent effects into adulthood. In the present study, we fed postnatal day (PND) 24 weanling female rats an SPI diet for 30 d [short-term SPI (ST-SPI)], and on PND 55, we switched SPI diet to control Cas diet until age 6 mo. Rats then underwent either ovariectomy (OVX) or sham surgery and thereafter either continued to be fed an SPI diet or control diet for 1 or 3 wk. We showed significantly increased bone mass in 30-d SPI-fed young rats compared with controls. OVX-induced bone loss was associated with increased osteoblastic cell senescence. On the one hand, both long-term SPI (continuous SPI diet throughout life) and ST-SPI diet only in early life protected against 1 wk post-OVX-associated bone loss. On the other hand, long-term SPI diet diminished the loss of total, trabecular, and cortical bone mineral density, whereas ST-SPI diet only reduced cortical bone mineral density loss 3 wk post-OVX. Persistent and protective effects of SPI diets on OVX-induced bone loss were associated with down-regulation of the caveolin-1/p53-mediated senescence pathway in bone. We recapitulated these results in cell cultures. Reprogramming of cellular senescence signaling by SPI-associated isoflavones in osteoblastic cells may explain the persistent effects of SPI on bone. These results suggest that OVX-induced bone loss, in part, is a result of increased osteoblastic cell senescence, and that ST-SPI diet early in life has modest but persistent programming effects on bone formation to prevent OVX-induced bone loss in adult female rats.-Chen, J.-R., Lazarenko, O.

Integrating obesity prevention messages within existing programs, better coordination between prevention and treatment services and the establishment of a childhood obesity surveillance system, were some of the important changes suggested by service providers.This study has found that low CALD health literacy, lack of knowledge of cultural barriers among service providers and co-existing deficiencies in the structure and delivery of obesity prevention services negatively impacted the participation of CALD communities in obesity prevention services. Cultural competency training of service providers would improve their understanding of the cultural influences of childhood obesity and incorporate them into the design and development of obesity prevention initiatives. Service providers need to be educated on the pre-migratory health service experiences and health conditions of CALD communities to ensure equitable delivery of care.

Using results from the CGMD model and the overdamped Fokker-Planck equation, we show that the diffusion tensor and particle density of water in the tBLM is spatially dependent. Further, it is shown that the membrane thickness, lipid diffusion, defect density, free energy of lipid flip-flop, and membrane dielectric permittivity are all dependent on the tether density. The numerically computed results from the CGMD model are in agreement with the experimentally measured results from tBLMs containing different tether densities and lipids derived from Archaebacteria. Additionally, using experimental measurements from Escherichia coli bacteria and Saccharomyces Cerevisiae yeast tethered membranes, we illustrate how previous molecular dynamics results can be combined with the proposed model to estimate the dielectric permittivity and defect density of these membranes as a function of tether density."

https://openalex.org/W2530048320,"Delineating populations of pantropical marine fish is a difficult process, due to widespread geographic ranges and complex life history traits in most species. Exocoetus volitans, a species of two-winged flyingfish, is a good model for understanding large-scale patterns of epipelagic fish population structure because it has a circumtropical geographic range and completes its entire life cycle in the epipelagic zone. Buoyant pelagic eggs should dictate high local dispersal capacity in this species, although a brief larval phase, small body size, and short lifespan may limit the dispersal of individuals over large spatial scales. Based on these biological features, we hypothesized that E. volitans would exhibit statistically and biologically significant population structure defined by recognized oceanographic barriers. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing cytochrome b mtDNA sequence data (1106 bps) from specimens collected in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans (n = 266). AMOVA, Bayesian, and coalescent analytical approaches were used to assess and interpret population-level genetic variability. A parsimony-based haplotype network did not reveal population subdivision among ocean basins, but AMOVA revealed limited, statistically significant population structure between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (ΦST = 0.035, p<0.001). A spatially-unbiased Bayesian approach identified two circumtropical population clusters north and south of the Equator (ΦST = 0.026, p<0.001), a previously unknown dispersal barrier for an epipelagic fish. Bayesian demographic modeling suggested the effective population size of this species increased by at least an order of magnitude ~150,000 years ago, to more than 1 billion individuals currently. Thus, high levels of genetic similarity observed in E. volitans can be explained by high rates of gene flow, a dramatic and recent population expansion, as well as extensive and consistent dispersal throughout the geographic range of the species."

(1) In the learning stage, fuzzy clustering is utilized firstly to get the representative frames of motions, and the gesture features of the motions are extracted to build a motion feature database. Based on the motion feature database and statistical learning, the probability distribution function of different motion classes is obtained. (2) In the motion retrieval stage, the query motion feature is extracted firstly according to stage (1). Similarity measurements are then conducted employing a novel method that combines category-based motion similarity distances with similarity distances based on canonical correlation analysis. The two motion distances are fused using Bayesian estimation, and the retrieval results are ranked according to the fused values. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W2962816402,"The role of Network Theory in the study of the financial crisis has been widely spotted in the latest years. It has been shown how the network topology and the dynamics running on top of it can trigger the outbreak of large systemic crisis. Following this methodological perspective we introduce here the Accounting Network, i.e. the network we can extract through vector similarities techniques from companies’ financial statements. We build the Accounting Network on a large database of worldwide banks in the period 2001–2013, covering the onset of the global financial crisis of mid-2007. After a careful data cleaning, we apply a quality check in the construction of the network, introducing a parameter (the Quality Ratio) capable of trading off the size of the sample (coverage) and the representativeness of the financial statements (accuracy). We compute several basic network statistics and check, with the Louvain community detection algorithm, for emerging communities of banks. Remarkably enough sensible regional aggregations show up with the Japanese and the US clusters dominating the community structure, although the presence of a geographically mixed community points to a gradual convergence of banks into similar supranational practices. Finally, a Principal Component Analysis procedure reveals the main economic components that influence communities’ heterogeneity. Even using the most basic vector similarity hypotheses on the composition of the financial statements, the signature of the financial crisis clearly arises across the years around 2008. We finally discuss how the Accounting Networks can be improved to reflect the best practices in the financial statement analysis."

The development of starch biosynthesis by the Archaeplastida progenitor provided an efficient and dense energy storage molecule that dramatically altered terrestrial life on planet earth (1.Zeeman S.C. Kossmann J. Smith A.M. Starch: its metabolism, evolution, and biotechnological modification in plants.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61: 209-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). More recently, starch formed an integral component of human evolution and societal development (2.Perry G.H. Dominy N.J. Claw K.G. Lee A.S. Fiegler H. Redon R. Werner J. Villanea F.A. Mountain J.L. Misra R. Carter N.P. Lee C. Stone A.C. Diet and the evolution of human amylase gene copy number variation.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1256-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). By virtue of its importance, starch biosynthesis and molecular structure is studied intensely because fundamental questions remain: in particular, how glucose chains are synthesized and how different enzymes contribute to creating repeating three-dimensional structure in the starch granule. Starch is composed of two types of polymers with repeating d-glucose units termed amylose and amylopectin, which constitutes ∼25 and ∼75% of the granule mass, respectively. Amylose contains ∼1,000–3,000 glucose units joined in almost exclusively α1–4-glycosidic bonds, divided into ∼3–10 “linear” chains attached to each other by α1–6 “branch” linkages (3.Jane J. BeMiller J. Whistler R. Starch: Chemistry and Technology. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, Orlando, FL2009: 193-236Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Amylopectin is >95% α1–4 linked with ∼5% branching α1–6 linkages and contains ∼5,000–10,000 glucose units (3.Jane J. BeMiller J. Whistler R. Starch: Chemistry and Technology. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, Orlando, FL2009: 193-236Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 4.Keeling P.L. Myers A.M. Biochemistry and genetics of starch synthesis.Annu. Rev. Food Sci. Technol. 2010; 1: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Amylopectin and amylose are initially synthesized as (α1–4)-linked maltodextrins from ADP-α-d-glucose donor molecules by starch synthase enzymes, of which five classes are conserved in land plants, as shown in Fig. 1 (5.Smith A.M. Denyer K. Martin C. The synthesis of the starch granule.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 67-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Amylose is predominately synthesized by granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) 2The abbreviations used are: GBSS, granule-bound starch synthase; DPn, degree of polymerization n; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy; SS, starch synthase; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; ESI, electrospray ionization.

J. 1999; 340: 183-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SSI, SSIIa, and SSIII are all involved in producing the linear chains of amylopectin, and SSIV along with SSIII appear to be involved in the initiation of granule formation (7.Szydlowski N. Ragel P. Raynaud S. Lucas M.M. Roldán I. Montero M. Muñoz F.J. Ovecka M. Bahaji A. Planchot V. Pozueta-Romero J. D'Hulst C. Mérida A.

In vitro biochemical characterization of all barley endosperm starch synthases.Front. Plant Sci. 2015; 6: 1265PubMed Google Scholar). Short to medium chain maltodextrins are modified by other enzymes including starch branching enzyme, phosphorylase, and starch-debranching enzyme to give rise to amylopectin. Amylose and amylopectin synthesis is tightly controlled to properly assemble the higher order structure in the starch granule that is required to expel water, although surprisingly little is known about this process. According to widely accepted models, the nascent structure is radially arranged around the initiation site with the non-reducing ends facing away from the initiation site. This is thought to be favorable because the starch granules are degraded from the non-reducing termini, meaning more surface area for efficient metabolism (1.Zeeman S.C. Kossmann J. Smith A.M. Starch: its metabolism, evolution, and biotechnological modification in plants.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61: 209-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Amylopectin forms dehydrated regions of semicrystalline and amorphous lamellae with a periodicity of 9 nm (1.Zeeman S.C. Kossmann J. Smith A.M. Starch: its metabolism, evolution, and biotechnological modification in plants.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61: 209-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The overall shape and size of starch granules can vary between species and is heavily influenced by environment; however, the periodicity of the lamellae remains constant (5.Smith A.M. Denyer K. Martin C. The synthesis of the starch granule.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 67-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The chemical structure of amylose and amylopectin implies that the fundamental process in the construction of starch granules is elongation of α1–4-linked glucan chains by SS. The polarity of d-glucose addition to a growing maltodextrin chain remains a primary question in starch biosynthesis and would affect enzymatic mechanisms put forward by several groups (9.Mukerjea R.

Biol. 2011; 7: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Leloir and co-workers first addressed this question and demonstrated that the [14C]glucose moiety from UDP-[14C]glucose or ADP-[14C]glucose was incorporated into both amylose and amylopectin within starch granules (12.Rongine de Fekete M.A. Leloir L.F. Cardini C.E. Mechanism of starch biosynthesis.Nature. 1960; 187: 918-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13.Leloir L.F. Rongine de Fekete M.A. Cardini C.E.

Adenosine diphosphate glucose and starch synthesis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1961; 6: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Digestion of these granules with the exo-acting enzyme β-amylase released [14C]maltobiose, indicating d-glucose is added to the non-reducing end of the growing maltodextrin polymers. Further evidence for a non-reducing end addition mechanism was found upon analysis of reaction products with chemical degradation methods that distinguish polarity. In this case, [14C]glucose addition (in the form of UDP-[14C]glucose) to unlabeled maltotriose or maltotetraose using SS from starch granules occurred at the non-reducing pole (13.Leloir L.F.

Both of these laboratories used enzyme mixtures from natural sources and degradation methods that are subject to errors.

These studies detailed the effect of amino acid substitutions to SS enzymes, as well as kinetic characterization of substrate acceptors; however, none of these studies directly characterized the acceptor product to address the polarity of maltodextrin growth, and many show only single additions from the SS enzymes. In this study we expressed and purified recombinant Zea mays SSIIa to address the polarity of d-glucose addition using sensitive, high resolution MS and NMR techniques. We chose maltohexaose (DP6) as the primary substrate because SSIIa was shown to elongate DP6 chains in a distributive manner (8.Cuesta-Seijo J.A. Nielsen M.M. Ruzanski C. Krucewicz K. Beeren S.R. Rydhal M.G. Yoshimura Y. Striebeck A. Motawia M.S. Willats W.G. Palcic M.M. In vitro biochemical characterization of all barley endosperm starch synthases.Front. Plant Sci. 2015; 6: 1265PubMed Google Scholar). SSIIa from Z. mays (ZmSSIIa) expressed in Escherichia coli as a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of 77.3 kDa as shown in Fig. 2. The majority of the protein expressed in an insoluble form, although soluble S-tagged ZmSSIIa constituted the predominant protein (>80%) following purification with S protein-agarose beads. This recombinant protein expression system eliminates potential contamination from other competing SS isoforms or other maltodextrin-modifying enzymes that would be present using starch granules as an enzyme source. ZmSSIIa bound to S-agarose beads served as the enzyme source for all subsequent analyses. Previous analyses using this expression system demonstrated that the kinetic parameters of the enzyme were essentially identical whether it was bound to beads or free in solution after release from the matrix (23.Huang B. Keeling P.L. Hennen-Bierwagen T.A. Myers A.M. Comparative in vitro analyses of recombinant maize starch synthases SSI, SSIIa, and SSIII reveal direct regulatory interactions and thermosensitivity.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2016; 596: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). ZmSSIIa utilized ADP-glucose in the presence of maltodextrin or glycogen. The rate of ADP generation was higher with 10 mg/ml glycogen as an acceptor substrate when compared with the rate with 10 mm maltohexaose (DP6) as shown in Fig. 3A. It is difficult to directly compare the initial velocities of these two reactions because of the undefined concentration of acceptor sites in the reaction containing glycogen. We observed background intensity in reactions that contained ADP-glucose (Fig. 3B). This background increased noise in the experiments but proved smaller than the rates observed with enzyme, acceptor, and ADP-glucose present. Analysis of the maltodextrin products revealed multiple additions to maltohexaose (DP6) during the ZmSSIIa-catalyzed reaction. TLC analysis of the substrates and products showed the near complete disappearance of ADP-glucose, the formation of primarily maltoheptaose (DP7) in the early stages of the reaction, and a distribution of larger forms (DP8–14) in the later stages from a reaction containing ZmSSIIa (Fig. 4). A similar reaction lacking the DP6 acceptor substrate showed no product formation and consistent ADP-glucose levels. MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the maltodextrin reaction products showed the same result (data not shown). The sequential addition of glucose residues to maltohexaose is consistent with reports that SSIIa acts in a distributive manner (6.Denyer K. Waite D. Motawia S. Møller B.L. Smith A.M. Granule-bound starch synthase I in isolated starch granules elongates malto-oligosaccharides processively.Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 183-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Cuesta-Seijo J.A.

In vitro biochemical characterization of all barley endosperm starch synthases.Front. Plant Sci. 2015; 6: 1265PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that the ZmSSIIa preparation was active in solution and catalyzed multiple additions but do not provide information regarding the polarity of maltodextrin chain growth. Once maltodextrin is extended, it is impossible to distinguish newly added glucose residues from those present in the starting material. We synthesized ADP-[13CU]glucose for use as a donor substrate in a ZmSSIIa-catalyzed reaction to eliminate isotopic symmetry of the maltodextrin product. We pursued a one-pot, enzyme-catalyzed reaction scheme to prepare ADP-[13CU]glucose and avoid losses from purifying pathway intermediates (Fig. 5A). Hexokinase, phosphoglucomutase, a thermostable ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (GlgC2), and an inorganic pyrophosphorylase were active in a HEPES, pH 7.5 buffer and converted >99% of the starting [13CU]glucose to ADP-[13CU]glucose. A 1H NMR spectrum of ADP-[13CU]glucose purified by anion exchange chromatography revealed no identifiable peaks corresponding contaminating species other than a pH buffer and a chemical shift standard (4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid; Fig. 5B). Seven strong peaks observed in a two-dimensional heteronuclear (1H-13C) single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum were consistent with a highly purified sample free of contaminating nucleotide, free glucose, or other 13C-enriched molecule (Fig. 5C). ZmSSIIa utilized the isotopically labeled donor substrate as efficiently as unlabeled ADP-glucose (data not shown). It is possible that ZmSSIIa adds glucose to the reducing end of maltodextrin, the non-reducing end, or a combination of both. We analyzed the reaction products directly to determine the polarity of ZmSSIIa-catalyzed maltodextrin chain elongation. The analytic scheme diagrammed in Fig. 6A utilizes unlabeled maltohexaose (DP6) as an acceptor substrate and ADP-[13CU]glucose as the donor. Reaction times were limited by removing enzyme-linked agarose beads to terminate catalysis. Next, reductive amination completely modified the reducing end of the product and unreacted maltodextrin substrate with N-(naphthyl)-ethylenediamine and provided a handle for reversed phase chromatography prior to ESI-MS. The MS spectrum indicated that DP7 constituted a majority of the product with a small amount converted to DP8, and differences of <0.01 Da separated the expected and observed masses for all species (Fig. 6B). We observed multiple singly charged forms corresponding to +H+, +Na+, and +K+ adducts of each reaction product and unreacted substrate using the positive instrument mode. Once ions corresponding to modified substrate and product molecules were identified in MS spectra (Fig. 6B), the polarity of [13CU]glucose addition was determined by fragmenting the parent ions in a second MS dimension. If the [13CU]glucose molecule was added to the reducing end, the [13CU]glucose would be directly attached to the N-(naphthyl)-ethylenediamine tag. However, if the [13CU]glucose molecule was added to the non-reducing end, the N-(naphthyl)-ethylenediamine tag would be attached to an unlabeled [12C]glucose unit. If both ends were modified, a mixture of 12C- and 13CU-labeled species would be identified and could be directly compared with determine the reaction preference. The isolation of specific parent ions from the first MS dimension using the Orbitrap instrument prevents cross-contamination of different parent ion species and thus selective MS/MS spectra. Ion selection provided very high signal to noise measurements in the MS/MS spectra. The MS/MS spectrum of the DP6 substrate that corresponded to the parent ion, and a neutral loss of n*(∼162.1), which indicates loss of n [12C]glucose units where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (Fig. 6C). As expected for the unlabeled substrate, the reducing end N-(naphthyl)-ethylenediamine tag coupled to a [12C]glucose was also found with a mass of 351.2 Da. MS/MS spectra of the labeled DP7 reaction product revealed a neutral loss of ∼168.1 Da when compared with the parent ion, indicating loss of a [13CU]glucose unit from the non-reducing end (Fig. 6D). The spectra revealed no evidence for the neutral loss of ∼162.1 Da from the parent ion. Furthermore, the second dimension spectrum contained reducing end N-(naphthyl)-ethylenediamine tag coupled to a [12C]glucose (351.2 Da) and revealed no evidence of a N-(naphthyl)-ethylenediamine tag coupled to a [13C]glucose (357.2 Da; Fig. 7). Comparison of the signal intensity of the peak at 351.2 Da to the noise level observed surrounding 357.2 Da revealed that ZmSSIIa prefers the non-reducing end of maltohexaose for >99.987% of glucose addition reactions. Similar degradation patterns of the DP8 reaction product in MS/MS spectra provided data complementary to that described for DP7 above (Fig. 6E). In this instance neutral loss of one labeled glucose unit (∼168.1 Da) or two labeled units (∼336.2) from the parent ion indicated addition at the non-reducing end, and [13C]glucose modified by the chemical tag and thus located at the reducing end was not detected. Labeling maltodextrins with stable isotopes provides an opportunity to validate the ESI-MS/MS analysis of SSIIa recognition polarity with an orthogonal technique. [13CU]Glucose addition to the non-reducing end of maltodextrin can be distinguished from reducing end modification using solution NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 8). The anomeric 1H1 and 13C1 nuclei (Fig. 8A) display characteristic resonance frequencies depending upon the chemistry of the glycosidic linkage and stereochemistry of the hemiacetal moiety. A glucose residue at the reducing end of a maltodextrin will have an anomeric configuration that mutarotates between α and β forms with 1H1 resonance frequencies at 5.19 and 4.62 ppm, respectively (Fig. 8B). A glucose residue at the non-reducing end or within the interior of the polymer will be locked in the α configuration with a 1H1 frequency of 5.37 ppm. Carbon [13C] chemical shifts are likewise distinct. Two-dimensional HSQC NMR spectra of a reaction similar to that described for the ESI-MS/MS analysis between maltohexaose, ADP-[13CU]glucose, and ZmSSIIa revealed 1H-13C correlations (Fig. 8C). Peaks for all three expected anomeric correlations in a mixture of maltohexaose (DP6) and maltoheptaose (DP7) were identified (non-reducing end α, reducing end α, and reducing end β). 1H-13C correlations for the free anomeric carbons are due to the ∼1% natural [13C] abundance rather than to labeling with incorporated [13CU]glucose, because they appear in spectra of unreacted maltohexaose substrate (data not shown). The peak for the bound anomeric [13C] carbons, which includes the non-reducing end, has much greater intensity than the free anomeric carbon peak. The presence of a strong peak in the HSQC spectrum corresponding to the alpha form of the non-reducing end indicated the reaction specifically modified the maltohexaose non-reducing end with [13CU]glucose. The effect of natural [13C] abundance in NMR spectra of labeled maltodextrins may be reduced by utilizing 13C-13C pairs to probe the added [13CU]glucose unit specifically with an HCCH-TOCSY pulse sequence commonly applied to assign amino acids side chain resonances in uniformly 13C-labeled proteins (24.Bax A.

Reson. 1990; 88: 425-431Google Scholar). This experiment passes magnetization between adjacent 13C-13C pairs (1H1-13C1-13C2-1H2, for example), which by natural abundance represent only 1 in 10,000 carbon atoms, but 98% of the carbons in the [13CU, 99%]glucose. Any correlations that meet these criteria are found as off-diagonal peaks in a plot showing 1H frequency on the x and y axes. Peaks located along the diagonal (that have the same 1H frequency in both the x and y dimensions) indicate that no transfer occurred and are not informative (Fig. 8, D–F). A two-dimensional 1H(CC)1H-TOCSY experiment on the material prepared using the reaction described above showed correlations between the 1H1 of the non-reducing end glucose (observed on the x axis) and the 1H2 nucleus (located on the vertical dashed gray line and surrounded by a dashed red circle in Fig. 8D), but no similar cross-peaks for either the α or β 1H1 glucose residue on the reducing end (marked by gray H2 labels in Fig. 8D). An artifact peak was observed (marked a in Fig. 8, D–F) but was identified as a minor contaminant from the ADP-[13CU]glucose substrate (Fig. 8F) not present in the maltohexaose substrate (Fig. 8E). We observed a small amount of H2 signal from an HCCH-TOCSY spectrum of the unlabeled maltohexaose substrate caused by natural abundance 13C upon lowering the contour level to nearly that of noise (Fig. 8E). Although the signal from [13CU]glucose was much stronger, we explored the result of a longer magnetization transfer pathway to suppress background signals an additional 100-fold (or 1 in 1,000,000). This pathway involved three 13C transfers and can be seen in the H3 peaks in Fig. 8D (1H1-13C1-13C2-13C3-1H3). H3 signals from a reducing end glucose residue were not observed. These HCCH-TOCSY spectra agree completely with the HSQC spectra and ESI-MS/MS analysis and unambiguously identify the non-reducing end of maltohexaose as the primary acceptor site for ZmSSIIa-catalyzed maltodextrin elongation. This study directly characterized the chemical structure of ZmSSIIa reaction products. MS analyses that directly distinguished the position of the newly added glucosyl moiety showed a striking preference for the non-reducing end within a sensitivity limit that cannot exclude one reducing end addition for more than 7,850 glucose units incorporated. NMR spectra proved less sensitive than the ESI-MS spectra and could not independently support the >7,850:1 addition ratio, however, observation of 1H correlation signals requiring two or three adjacent 13C atoms qualitatively demonstrated that the great majority of additions are at the non-reducing end. Taken together, these two analytical techniques provide definitive evidence that ZmSSIIa catalysis is specific for the non-reducing end of a maltodextrin acceptor substrate. The techniques described here can be used to directly assess this prediction for any other plant SS or glycosyl transferases from other species. ZmSSIIa activity was undetectable when maltohexaose was omitted from the reaction. This was evident from the lack of maltodextrin products detected either by TLC or MALDI-TOF and from the consistent ADP-glucose levels (Fig. 4A, right side). Thus, in this reconstituted system, the activity of SSIIa is strictly dependent on the presence of a maltodextrin acceptor substrate. These results support the original conclusion of Leloir and co-workers that SS present within starch granules adds primarily to the non-reducing end (12.Rongine de Fekete M.A. Leloir L.F.

It is unclear why Robyt and Leloir arrived at different conclusions despite the use of similar techniques and comparable material sources, although both relied upon indirect analysis techniques that characterized hydrolyzed glucose units following reduction or oxidation of the maltodextrin chain (9.Mukerjea R.

https://openalex.org/W2531720272,"Ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK) play important roles in cell signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Each of the four RSK isoforms (RSK1-4) is a single polypeptide chain containing two kinase domains connected by a linker sequence with regulatory phosphorylation sites. Here, we demonstrate that full-length RSK2—which is implicated in several types of cancer, and which is linked to the genetic Coffin-Lowry syndrome—can be overexpressed with high yields in Escherichia coli as a fusion with maltose binding protein (MBP), and can be purified to homogeneity after proteolytic removal of MBP by affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. The purified protein can be fully activated in vitro by phosphorylation with protein kinases ERK2 and PDK1. Compared to full-length RSK2 purified from insect host cells, the bacterially expressed and phosphorylated murine RSK2 shows the same levels of catalytic activity after phosphorylation, and sensitivity to inhibition by RSK-specific inhibitor SL0101. Interestingly, we detect low levels of phosphorylation in the nascent RSK2 on Ser386, owing to autocatalysis by the C-terminal domain, independent of ERK. This observation has implications for in vivo signaling, as it suggests that full activation of RSK2 by PDK1 alone is possible, circumventing at least in some cases the requirement for ERK."
https://openalex.org/W2530224025,"Macrophages can be activated into several distinct activation states. One of these states, type II activation, has a regulatory phenotype characterized by decreased IL-12 and increased IL-10, and has been shown to bias naïve CD4+ T cells to a Th2 response. Microglia, the resident macrophage-like cells in the central nervous system (CNS), are important contributors to neuroinflammation and, thus, we investigated if type II activated microglia could bias CD4+ T cell responses in a similar manner as type II activated macrophages. Using immune complex ligation in the presence of LPS to induce type II activation, we found that both type II macrophages and type II microglia biased CD4+ T cell responses in vitro to express increased levels of IL-17A and CD124. The enhanced IL-17A production occurred independently of IL-6, and IL-10 and IL-12, which were key regulators of IFN-γ production, but were not involved in the increased IL-17A. Finally, we found that another type II-activating compound, glatiramer acetate, did not bias CD4+ T cells to produce enhanced IL-17A. Taken together, this study demonstrates that microglia can be type II activated and, similarly to type II macrophages, can bias CD4+ T cell responses; however, depending on the type II stimulus, the effect on CD4+ T cell subset differentiation may vary."

https://openalex.org/W2531093674,"Novel families of short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) sequences in the human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, clinical isolate Af293, were identified and categorised into tRNA-related and 5S rRNA-related SINEs. Eight predicted tRNA-related SINE families originating from different tRNAs, and nominated as AfuSINE2 sequences, contained target site duplications of short direct repeat sequences (4-14 bp) flanking the elements, an extended tRNA-unrelated region and typical features of RNA polymerase III promoter sequences. The elements ranged in size from 140-493 bp and were present in low copy number in the genome and five out of eight were actively transcribed. One putative tRNAArg-derived sequence, AfuSINE2-1a possessed a unique feature of repeated trinucleotide ACT residues at its 3'-terminus. This element was similar in sequence to the I-4_AO element found in A. oryzae and an I-1_AF long nuclear interspersed element-like sequence identified in A. fumigatus Af293. Families of 5S rRNA-related SINE sequences, nominated as AfuSINE3, were also identified and their 5'-5S rRNA-related regions show 50-65% and 60-75% similarity to respectively A. fumigatus 5S rRNAs and SINE3-1_AO found in A. oryzae. A. fumigatus Af293 contains five copies of AfuSINE3 sequences ranging in size from 259-343 bp and two out of five AfuSINE3 sequences were actively transcribed. Investigations on AfuSINE distribution in the fungal genome revealed that the elements are enriched in pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions and inserted within gene-rich regions. We also demonstrated that some, but not all, AfuSINE sequences are targeted by host RNA silencing mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrated that infection of the fungus with mycoviruses had no apparent effects on SINE activity."
https://openalex.org/W2530030838,"Micronutrient deficiencies can lead to anemia, growth restriction, and poor motor and cognitive development. A clinical trial was planned to assess the impact of nutritional supplementation on cognitive measures in preschool children. Conducting clinical trials in children is difficult due to underlying laws, hesitation of the research community, and difficult enrollment. We carried out a questionnaire-based feasibility survey to assess the interest of parents towards participation in such a nutrition-based study.After approval from the Institutional Human Research Ethics Committee, the principals of four kindergarten schools at Vallabh Vidyanagar, Anand, Gujarat, India consented to participate. Children at the participating schools were distributed a consent form and pre-tested questionnaire, to be taken home for parents to sign, fill and return.Out of a total of 1049 consent forms and questionnaires distributed, 602 (57.39%) signed and filled forms were returned. Despite fair awareness regarding the need of research, parents' willingness to involve their children in a 6 month duration research study, not requiring invasive measures like blood pricks, was 180 (29.9%). Nearly half (250, 41.5%) did not respond and more than a quarter (172, 28.6%) declined participation on behalf of their children.The interest level of a pre-school child's parents for participation of the child in a nutrition intervention study evaluating cognitive measures like memory is low. Understanding the study population's motivating and inhibiting factors leading to decreased participation in clinical trials is necessary to facilitate the creation of a pertinent evidence base."
https://openalex.org/W2530216994,"Two-dimensional (2D) spatially selective radiofrequency (RF) pulses may be used to excite restricted volumes. By incorporating a ""pencil beam"" 2D pulse into a T2-Prep, one may create a ""2D-T2-Prep"" that combines T2-weighting with an intrinsic outer volume suppression. This may particularly benefit parallel imaging techniques, where artefacts typically originate from residual foldover signal. By suppressing foldover signal with a 2D-T2-Prep, image quality may therefore improve. We present numerical simulations, phantom and in vivo validations to address this hypothesis.A 2D-T2-Prep and a conventional T2-Prep were used with GRAPPA-accelerated MRI (R = 1.6). The techniques were first compared in numerical phantoms, where per pixel maps of SNR (SNRmulti), noise, and g-factor were predicted for idealized sequences. Physical phantoms, with compartments doped to mimic blood, myocardium, fat, and coronary vasculature, were scanned with both T2-Preparation techniques to determine the actual SNRmulti and vessel sharpness. For in vivo experiments, the right coronary artery (RCA) was imaged in 10 healthy adults, using accelerations of R = 1,3, and 6, and vessel sharpness was measured for each.In both simulations and phantom experiments, the 2D-T2-Prep improved SNR relative to the conventional T2-Prep, by an amount that depended on both the acceleration factor and the degree of outer volume suppression. For in vivo images of the RCA, vessel sharpness improved most at higher acceleration factors, demonstrating that the 2D-T2-Prep especially benefits accelerated coronary MRA.Suppressing outer volume signal with a 2D-T2-Prep improves image quality particularly well in GRAPPA-accelerated acquisitions in simulations, phantoms, and volunteers, demonstrating that it should be considered when performing accelerated coronary MRA."
https://openalex.org/W2530854468,"Abstract The cytoplasmic actuator domain of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase undergoes large rotational movements that influence the distant transmembrane transport sites, and a long second transmembrane helix (M2) connected with this domain plays critical roles in transmitting motions between the cytoplasmic catalytic domains and transport sites. Here we explore possible structural roles of Gly105 between the cytoplasmic (M2c) and transmembrane (M2m) segments of M2 by introducing mutations that limit/increase conformational freedom. Alanine substitution G105A markedly retards isomerization of the phosphoenzyme intermediate (E1PCa2 → E2PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+), and disrupts Ca2+ occlusion in E1PCa2 and E2PCa2 at the transport sites uncoupling ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ transport. In contrast, this substitution accelerates the ATPase activation (E2 → E1Ca2). Introducing a glycine by substituting another residue on M2 in the G105A mutant (i.e. substitution) identifies the glycine positions required for proper Ca2+ handling and kinetics in each step. All wild-type kinetic properties, including coupled transport, are fully restored in the G-shift substitution at position 112 (G105A/A112G) located on the same side of the M2c helix as Gly105 facing M4/phosphorylation domain. Results demonstrate that Gly105 functions as a flexible knee-like joint during the Ca2+ transport cycle, so that cytoplasmic domain motions can bend and strain M2 in the correct direction or straighten the helix for proper gating and coupling of Ca2+ transport and ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2530383662,"The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)-often referred to as the master circadian clock-is essential in generating physiologic rhythms and orchestrating synchrony among circadian clocks. This study tested the hypothesis that periodic motivation induced by rhythmically pairing 2 reinforcing stimuli [methamphetamine (Meth) and running wheel (RW)] restores autonomous circadian activity in arrhythmic SCN-lesioned (SCNX) C3H/HeN mice. Sham-surgery and SCNX mice were treated with either Meth (1.2 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle in association, dissociation, or absence of an RW. Only the association of Meth treatment and restricted RW access successfully reestablished entrained circadian rhythms in mice with SCNX. RW-likely acting as a link between the circadian and reward systems-promotes circadian entrainment of activity. We conclude that a conditioned drug response is a powerful tool to entrain, drive, and restore circadian physiology. Furthermore, an RW should be recognized as a potent input signal in addition to the conventional use as an output signal.-Rawashdeh, O., Clough, S. J., Hudson, R. L., Dubocovich, M. L. Learned motivation drives circadian physiology in the absence of the master circadian clock."
